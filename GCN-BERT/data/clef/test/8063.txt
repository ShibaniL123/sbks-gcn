FIELD OF THE INVENTION [003] The field of the present invention relates to configurations of DNA vectors for heterologous gene expression, methods for identifying preferred configurations including those that are able to achieve stable modifications of the genomes of target cells, and the use of transposons and transposases. 2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [004] DNA constructs are typically propagated as plasmids. Plasmids are frequently constructed by cloning a first polynucleotide sequence into a vector. The vector generally comprises sequences required for propagation in at least one host cell, but it often also comprises sequences that contribute to the functioning of the first polynucleotide sequence. For example a vector may comprise elements that affect the expression of a polypeptide encoded by the first polynucleotide sequence such as promoters, enhancers, introns, terminators, translational initiation signals, polyadenylation signals, replication elements, RNA processing and export elements, and elements that affect chromatin structure that become operably linked to the first polynucleotide. The process of optimizing a polynucleotide for a specific function often comprises creating a plurality of polynucleotides, cloning them into the same vector to create a first plurality of cloned polynucleotides and measuring a property of some of the cloned polynucleotides. [005] Because the process of cloning polynucleotides into a single vector is relatively simple, while the process of constructing a vector is more complex and costly, optimization almost always focuses on creating variation in the cloned polynucleotide and very rarely on variations in the vector. Even if the vector sequence is varied, this will typically be done by selecting from a small number of pre-existing vectors rather than by deliberately constructing a new set of vectors. However vectors frequently contain many or even most of the elements that determine the function of the cloned polynucleotide, for example the expression of the polynucleotide in an expression-host. The functional performance of many of these elements may depend on the precise host cell being used, for example some elements that perform well in human cells may perform poorly in rodent cells, the same vector is often used in both. [006] Furthermore, many available vectors have been constructed by standard restriction site cloning methods and derived from other vectors wherein the functional elements have not been well defined. Consequently many vectors contain "fossil" sequences that are unnecessary for their function but have just been included because of imprecise cloning methods or a lack of understanding of function (for example the f 1 phage origin of replication, originally incorporated for generation of phagemids which can be found in many vectors that are never used to make phagemids), or they contain sequences that actually compromise function (for example the use of the beta lactamase gene as a selectable marker which exacerbates instability in vectors such as lentiviruses). [007] Because of the immense size of sequence space, there is no effective way to test all possible permutations of a polymeric biological molecule such as a nucleic acid or protein for a desired property. To test each possible nucleotide base at each position in a vector, rapidly leads to such a large number of molecules to be tested such that no available methods of synthesis or testing are feasible, even for a polymer of modest length. Furthermore, most molecules generated in such a way would lack any measurable level of the desired property. Total sequence space is very large and the functional solutions in this space are sparsely distributed. [008] There is thus a need in the art for methods to efficiently identify vector components that contribute to performance, and to assess this performance. [009] Typical methods for introducing DNA into a cell include DNA condensing reagents such as calcium phosphate, polyethylene glycol, lipid-containing reagents such as liposomes, multi-lamellar vesicles as well as virus-mediated strategies. However, such methods can have certain limitations. For example, there are size constraints associated with DNA condensing reagents and virus -mediated strategies. Further, the amount of nucleic acid that can be transfected into a cell is limited in viral strategies. In addition, not all methods facilitate insertion of the delivered nucleic acid into cellular nucleic acid, and while DNA condensing methods and lipid-containing reagents are relatively easy to prepare, the insertion of nucleic acid into viral vectors can be labor intensive. Virus-mediated strategies can be cell- type specific or tissue-type specific, and the use of virus-mediated strategies can create immunologic problems when used in vivo. [0010] Integration of heterologous DNA into a target genome, and the expression levels of genes encoded by the integrated heterologous DNA can be increased by the configuration of DNA elements. The efficiency of integration, the size of the heterologous DNA sequence that can be integrated, and the number of copies of the heterologous DNA sequence that are integrated into each genome can often be further improved by using transposons. Transposons or transposable elements include a short nucleic acid sequence with terminal repeat sequences upstream and downstream. Active transposons can encode enzymes that facilitate the excision and insertion of the nucleic acid into target DNA sequences. A number of transposable elements have been described in the art that facilitate insertion of nucleic acids into the genome of vertebrates. For example, transposable elements discovered from various sources, for example, an engineered transposon from the genome of salmonid fish called sleeping beauty; piggyBac transposon from lepidopteran cells; piggyBac transposon from the bat Myotis lucifugus; mariner transposon first discovered in Drosophila and; an engineered transposon and transposon inverted repeats from the frog species, Rana pipiens called frog prince. [0011] Different transposable elements show different preferences for the genomic sites at which they integrate. For example the piggyBac and piggyBat transposons have a preference for transcriptionally inactive regions. Although this may be an advantage for the "wild" transposon which does not wish to disrupt gene expression in its host and risk killing it, it is a disadvantage for transposons that are being used to maximize gene expression. Thus although a number of transposable elements capable of facilitating insertion of nucleic acids into the eukaryotic genome have been identified in the art, there exists a need for alternative transposable elements and enhanced constructs that facilitate higher expression levels from inserted DNA, either because of higher insertion efficiency or because the genomic insertions are made at more favorable positions within the genome, compared with transposable elements currently described in the art. 3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0012] We describe novel ways to assess the performance of individual vector elements by analyzing the function of small numbers of vectors. The results of this analysis can then be used to create high performing combinations of the sequence elements. Such maps are used to direct perturbations or modifications of the nucleic acid construct sequences to perturb or modify the activity of the nucleic acid construct in a controlled fashion. [0013] Specific combinations of vector elements are described that contribute to vector performance in mammalian cells, in particular to yielding high levels of expression of polypeptides in either transiently or stably transfected cells. Vector elements include promoters, enhancers, introns, terminators, translational initiation signals, polyadenylation signals, virally derived replication elements, RNA processing and export elements, transposons, transposases and elements that affect chromatin structure. [0014] In some embodiments, heterologous gene expression can be improved when the construct further comprises sequence elements that enhance expression by effects on chromatin structure, or by affecting RNA processing or RNA export including scaffold and matrix attachment regions, introns and post transcriptional responsive elements such as WPRE, HPRE and AGS. In some embodiments, heterologous expression is improved when the construct further comprises sequences that reduce the spread of heterochromatin or the interference between one expression control region and another such as HS4 insulators or their core sequence. [0015] Heterologous gene expression from constructs that stably integrate into the target cell genome can be further improved by incorporating transposon ends: sequence elements that are recognized and transposed by transposases. DNA sequences inserted between a pair of Transposon ends can be excised by a transposase from one DNA molecule and (unless the transposase is integration-deficient) inserted into a second DNA molecule. Two novel transposon-transposase systems are disclosed, one derived from the silkworm Bombyx mori and the other from the frog Xenopus tropicalis. Each of these comprises sequences that function as transposon ends and that can be used in conjunction with a transposase that recognizes and acts upon those transposon ends, as gene transfer systems for stably introducing nucleic acids into the DNA of a cell. The gene transfer systems of the present invention can be used in methods, for example, but not limited to, heterologous gene expression, gene therapy, insertional mutagenesis, or gene discovery. [0016] In one aspect the invention features a transposon comprising a segment of heterologous DNA flanked by a pair of transposon end sequences or variants, derivatives and fragments of the transposon end sequences such that the transposon retains transposon activity.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0049] FIGURE 1: shows a transposon comprising a heterologous polynucleotide between flanking transposon ends which each comprise inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) (shown by black and grey arrowheads). The transposon ITRs are adjacent to a direct repeat of its target sequence. For the Trichoplusia ni piggyBac and the Xenopus transposons of the invention, this target sequence is 5'-TTAA-3'. For the Bombyx transposons of the invention this target sequence is 5'-TTAT-3'. The target sequence here is therefore represented as 5'-TTAW-3', where the W is A or T. When the transposon is transposed by the action of a transposase, it is excised from one DNA molecule where it leaves a single copy of the target sequence, and integrated into a second DNA molecule where it duplicates the target sequence such that the transposon remains flanked by the target sequence. The transposase may be provided either in cis (encoded in the same vector) or trans (encoded in a separate polynucleotide or as protein). When the transposase excises the transposon, the original sequence 5'-TTAW-3' is perfectly restored. [0050] FIGURE 2: shows sequencing results with the 5' -TTAT-3' target sequence left after integration and excision (shown by arrow) by a transposase from Bombyx mori. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were co-transfected with a transposon comprising transposon ends (SEQ ID NOS: 1 and 2) and a construct encoding a transposase (SEQ ID NO: 44) from Bombyx mori; cells were grown for 14 days post puromycin selection as described in Example 6.1.1. DNA was mini-prepped from cell lysates and PCRed under standard cycling conditions with a 5 second extension time using nested amplification primers flanking the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). PCR product was cloned into a cloning vector and transformed into E.coli. 16 clones from each of the amplified PCR products were picked and sequenced. All 16 clones showed a single 5'-TTAT-3' scar sequence showing the integration target sequence to be 5'-TTAT-3'. [0051] FIGURE 3: shows FACS data for stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell populations expressing DasherGFP (SEQ ID NO: 102). CHO cells were transfected with gene transfer vectors comprising Xenopus tropicalis transposon ends (SEQ ID NOS: 5, 6) flanking a heterologous nucleic acid encoding DasherGFP. The gene transfer vectors comprised different combinations of control elements including promoters and insulator sequences. Co-transfections with an expression vector encoding transposase (SEQ ID NO: 45) were done in parallel. Vectors with Trichoplusia ni piggyBac transposon ends (SEQ ID NOS: 30, 31) and hyperactive Trichoplusia ni piggyBac transposase (SEQ ID NO: 57) were tested under the same conditions. Cells were grown as described in Example 6.2. DasherGFP expressing cell populations are shown for CHO cells transfected in the absence of transposase (top panel) and after co-transfection with transposase (bottom panel). [0052] FIGURE 4: shows FACS data for stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell populations expressing DasherGFP (SEQ ID NO: 102) and CayenneRFP (SEQ ID NO: 103) linked by an IRES element (SEQ ID NO: 59) and operably linked to a single EFla promoter. CHO cells were transfected with a gene transfer vector with configuration as shown in Table 13 lines 3 and 4.. Co-transfections with an expression vector encoding a transposase (SEQ ID NO: 45) were done in parallel. Cells were grown as described in Example 6.2. DasherGFP expressing cell populations are shown (Panel A) for CHO cells transfected in the absence of transposase (top panel) and with co-transfection with transposase (bottom panel). CayenneRFP expressing cell populations are shown (Panel B) for CHO cells transfected in the absence of transposase (top panel) and after co-transfection with transposase (bottom panel). [0053] FIGURE 5: shows two graphs in which the measured values of expression of DasherGFP are shown on the X-axis, where DasherGFP is expressed from vectors with configurations shown in Table 15, expression data is from Table 19. The Y-axis of each graph shows the value predicted for DasherGFP expression from these vectors, using a model constructed, using partial least squares regression, from the sequence data in Table 15 and the expression properties shown in Table 19. 5. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 5.1 DEFINITIONS [0054] Use of the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a polynucleotide" includes a plurality of polynucleotides, reference to "a substrate" includes a plurality of such substrates, reference to "a variant" includes a plurality of variants, and the like. [0055] Terms such as "connected," "attached," "linked," and "conjugated" are used interchangeably herein and encompass direct as well as indirect connection, attachment, linkage or conjugation unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Where a range of values is recited, it is to be understood that each intervening integer value, and each fraction thereof, between the recited upper and lower limits of that range is also specifically disclosed, along with each subrange between such values. The upper and lower limits of any range can independently be included in or excluded from the range, and each range where either, neither or both limits are included is also encompassed within the invention. Where a value being discussed has inherent limits, for example where a component can be present at a concentration of from 0 to 100%, or where the pH of an aqueous solution can range from 1 to 14, those inherent limits are specifically disclosed. Where a value is explicitly recited, it is to be understood that values which are about the same quantity or amount as the recited value are also within the scope of the invention. Where a combination is disclosed, each sub combination of the elements of that combination is also specifically disclosed and is within the scope of the invention. Conversely, where different elements or groups of elements are individually disclosed, combinations thereof are also disclosed. Where any element of an invention is disclosed as having a plurality of alternatives, examples of that invention in which each alternative is excluded singly or in any combination with the other alternatives are also hereby disclosed; more than one element of an invention can have such exclusions, and all combinations of elements having such exclusions are hereby disclosed. [0056] Unless defined otherwise herein, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Singleton, et al., Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, 2nd Ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York (1994), and Hale & Marham, The Harper Collins Dictionary of Biology, Harper Perennial, NY, 1991 , provide one of skill with a general dictionary of many of the terms used in this invention. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are described. Unless otherwise indicated, nucleic acids are written left to right in 5' to 3' orientation; amino acid sequences are written left to right in amino to carboxy orientation, respectively. The terms defined immediately below are more fully defined by reference to the specification as a whole. [0057] The terms "polynucleotide," "oligonucleotide," "nucleic acid" and "nucleic acid molecule" and "gene" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, and may comprise ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleo tides, analogs thereof, or mixtures thereof. This term refers only to the primary structure of the molecule. Thus, the term includes triple-, double- and single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid ("DNA"), as well as triple-, double- and single- stranded ribonucleic acid ("RNA"). It also includes modified, for example by alkylation, and/or by capping, and unmodified forms of the polynucleotide. More particularly, the terms "polynucleotide," "oligonucleotide," "nucleic acid" and "nucleic acid molecule" include polydeoxyribonucleotides (containing 2-deoxy-D- ribose), polyribonucleotides (containing D-ribose), including tRNA, rRNA, hRNA, siRNA and mRNA, whether spliced or unspliced, any other type of polynucleotide which is an N- or C-glycoside of a purine or pyrimidine base, and other polymers containing nonnucleotidic backbones, for example, polyamide (for example, peptide nucleic acids ("PNAs")) and polymorpholino (commercially available from the Anti-Virals, Inc., Corvallis, Oreg., as Neugene) polymers, and other synthetic sequence-specific nucleic acid polymers providing that the polymers contain nucleobases in a configuration which allows for base pairing and base stacking, such as is found in DNA and RNA. There is no intended distinction in length between the terms "polynucleotide," "oligonucleotide," "nucleic acid" and "nucleic acid molecule," and these terms are used interchangeably herein. These terms refer only to the primary structure of the molecule. Thus, these terms include, for example, 3'-deoxy-2', 5'- DNA, oligodeoxyribonucleotide N3' P5' phosphoramidates, 2'-0-alkyl-substituted RNA, double- and single-stranded DNA, as well as double- and single- stranded RNA, and hybrids thereof including for example hybrids between DNA and RNA or between PNAs and DNA or RNA, and also include known types of modifications, for example, labels, alkylation, "caps," substitution of one or more of the nucleotides with an analog, internucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (for example, methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoramidates, carbamates, or the like) with negatively charged linkages (for example, phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, or the like), and with positively charged linkages (for example, aminoalkylphosphoramidates, aminoalkylphosphotriesters), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (including enzymes (for example, nucleases), toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, poly-L-lysine, or the like), those with intercalators (for example, acridine, psoralen, or the like), those containing chelates (of, for example, metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, or the like), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (for example, alpha anomeric nucleic acids, or the like), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide or oligonucleotide. [0058] The terms "polynucleotide," "oligonucleotide," "nucleic acid" and "nucleic acid molecule" and "gene" refer to the entire sequence or gene or a fragment thereof. The fragment thereof can be a functional fragment. Where the polynucleotides are to be used to express encoded proteins, nucleotides that can perform that function or which can be modified (for example, reverse transcribed) to perform that function are used. Where the polynucleotides are to be used in a scheme that requires that a complementary strand be formed to a given polynucleotide, nucleotides are used which permit such formation. [0059] As used herein, the terms "nucleoside" and "nucleotide" will include those moieties which contain not only the known purine and pyrimidine bases, but also other heterocyclic bases which have been modified. Such modifications include methylated purines or pyrimidines, acylated purines or pyrimidines, or other heterocycles. Modified nucleosides or nucleotides can also include modifications on the sugar moiety, for example, where one or more of the hydroxyl groups are replaced with halogen, aliphatic groups, or is functionalized as ethers, amines, or the like. The term "nucleotidic unit" is intended to encompass nucleosides and nucleotides. [0060] Standard A-T and G-C base pairs form under conditions which allow the formation of hydrogen bonds between the N3— H and C4-oxy of thymidine and the NI and C6-NH2, respectively, of adenosine and between the C2-oxy, N3 and C4— NH2, of cytidine and the C2- -N¾, N'-H and C6-oxy, respectively, of guanosine. Thus, for example, guanosine (2- amino-6-oxy-9-.beta.-D-ribofuranosyl-purine) may be modified to form isoguanosine (2-oxy- 6-amino-9-.beta.-D-ribofuranosyl-purine). Such modification results in a nucleoside base which will no longer effectively form a standard base pair with cytosine. However, modification of cytosine (l-.beta.-D-ribofuranosyl-2-oxy-4-amino-pyrimidine) to form isocytosine (l-.beta.-D-ribofuranosyl-2-amino-4-oxy-pyrimidine- ) results in a modified nucleotide which will not effectively base pair with guanosine but will form a base pair with isoguanosine (U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,702 to Collins et al., hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). Isocytosine is available from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.); isocytidine may be prepared by the method described by Switzer et al. (1993) Biochemistry 32: 10489- 10496 and references cited therein; 2'-deoxy-5-methyl-isocytidine may be prepared by the method of Tor et al., 1993, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 115:4461-4467 and references cited therein; and isoguanine nucleotides may be prepared using the method described by Switzer et al., 1993, supra, and Mantsch et al., 1993, Biochem. 14:5593-5601, or by the method described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,610 to Collins et al., each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Other nonnatural base pairs may be synthesized by the method described in Piccirilli et al., 1990, Nature 343:33-37, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, for the synthesis of 2,6-diaminopyrimidine and its complement (1-methylpyrazolo- [4,3]pyrimidine-5,7-(4H,6H)-dione. Other such modified nucleotidic units which form unique base pairs are known, such as those described in Leach et al. (1992) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114:3675-3683 and Switzer et al., supra. [0061] The phrase "DNA sequence" refers to a contiguous nucleic acid sequence. The sequence can be either single stranded or double stranded, DNA or RNA, but double stranded DNA sequences are preferable. The sequence can be an oligonucleotide of 2 to 20 nucleotides in length to a full length genomic sequence of thousands or hundreds of thousands of base pairs. [0062] The term "vector" or "DNA vector" or "gene transfer vector" refers to a polynucleotide sequence that is used to perform a "carrying" function for another polynucleotide. For example vectors are often used to allow a polynucleotide to be propagated within a living cell, or to allow a polynucleotide to be packaged for delivery into a cell, or to allow a polynucleotide to be integrated into the genomic DNA of a cell. A vector may further comprise additional functional elements, for example it may comprise a transposon. [0063] A "gene transfer system" comprises a vector or gene transfer vector, or a polynucleotide cloned into a vector. A gene transfer system may also comprise other features to facilitate the process of gene transfer. For example a gene transfer system may comprise a vector and a lipid or viral packaging mix for enabling a first polynucleotide to enter a cell, or it may comprise a vector that includes a transposon and a second polynucleotide sequence encoding a transposase to enhance productive genomic integration of the transposon. [0064] The term "host" means any prokaryotic or eukaryotic organism that can be a recipient of a nucleic acid. A "host," as the term is used herein, includes prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms that can be genetically engineered. For examples of such hosts, see Maniatis et al., Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1982). As used herein, the terms "host," "host cell," "host system" and "expression host" be used interchangeably. [0065] The term "expression construct" means any double-stranded DNA or double-stranded RNA designed to transcribe an RNA, for example, a construct that contains at least one promoter which is or may be operably linked to a downstream gene, coding region, or polynucleotide sequence (for example, a cDNA or genomic DNA fragment that encodes a polypeptide or protein, or an RNA effector molecule, for example, an antisense RNA, triplex- forming RNA, ribozyme, an artificially selected high affinity RNA ligand (aptamer), a double- stranded RNA, for example, an RNA molecule comprising a stem-loop or hairpin dsRNA, or a bi-finger or multi-finger dsRNA or a microRNA, or any RNA). An "expression construct" includes a double- stranded DNA or RNA comprising one or more promoters, wherein one or more of the promoters is not in fact operably linked to a polynucleotide sequence to be transcribed, but instead is designed for efficient insertion of an operably- linked polynucleotide sequence to be transcribed by the promoter. Transfection or transformation of the expression construct into a recipient cell allows the cell to express an RNA effector molecule, polypeptide, or protein encoded by the expression construct. An expression construct may be a genetically engineered plasmid, virus, recombinant virus, or an artificial chromosome derived from, for example, a bacteriophage, adenovirus, adeno- associated virus, retrovirus, lentivirus, poxvirus, or herpesvirus, or further embodiments described under "expression vector" below. An expression construct can be replicated in a living cell, or it can be made synthetically. For purposes of this application, the terms "expression construct", "expression vector", "vector", and "plasmid" are used interchangeably to demonstrate the application of the invention in a general, illustrative sense, and are not intended to limit the invention to a particular type of expression construct. [0066] The term "expression vector" or "expression construct" means a DNA construct that contains at least one promoter which is or may be operably linked to a downstream gene, coding region, or polynucleotide sequence to be transcribed (for example, a cDNA or genomic DNA fragment that encodes a protein, optionally, operably linked to sequence lying outside a coding region, an antisense RNA coding region, or RNA sequences lying outside a coding region). An expression vector or expression construct may also be a DNA construct comprising one or more promoters, wherein one or more of the promoters is not in fact operably linked to a polynucleotide sequence to be transcribed, but instead is designed for efficient insertion of an operably-linked polynucleotide sequence to be transcribed by the promoter. Transfection or transformation of the expression vector into a recipient cell allows the cell to express RNA encoded by the expression vector. An expression vector may be a genetically engineered plasmid, virus, transposon or artificial chromosome derived from, for example, a bacteriophage, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, retrovirus, poxvirus, or herpesvirus. Such expression vectors can include sequences from bacteria, viruses or phages. Such vectors include chromosomal, episomal and virus-derived vectors, for example, vectors derived from bacterial plasmids, bacteriophages, yeast episomes, yeast chromosomal elements, and viruses, vectors derived from combinations thereof, such as those derived from plasmid and bacteriophage genetic elements, cosmids and phagemids. Thus, one exemplary vector is a double- stranded DNA phage vector. Another exemplary vector is a double- stranded DNA viral vector. In one aspect, the invention relates to expression vectors, plasmids, and constructs as described herein, which are isolated and purified so as to be useful for any of a variety of applications, for example, as a reagent for scientific research, for human and/or veterinary use for therapeutic and/or prophylactic pharmaceutical purposes. [0067] An 'isolated' polypeptide or polynucleotide means a polypeptide or polynucleotide that has been either removed from its natural environment, produced using recombinant techniques, or chemically or enzymatically synthesized. Preferably, a polypeptide or polynucleotide of this invention is purified, that is, it is essentially free from any other polypeptide or polynucleotide and associated cellular products or other impurities. [0068] The term "Scar" refers to extra DNA sequences that are left as part of a polynucleotide construct that are an unavoidable consequence of the construction method rather than being incorporated because of their desirable functional properties. For example recombinases, integrases and restriction endonucleases often have recognition sequences that remain within the sequence of a polynucleotide that is constructed using the action of the recombinases, integrases and restriction endonucleases. The term "Scar Size" refers to the length of the extra DNA sequences. For example a scar size of 34 base pairs is left in a construct with a recognition sequence for Cre recombinase, a scar size of 25 base pairs is added on when attB integrase is used. Scars can interfere with the functions of other sequence elements within the construct. [0069] The term "overhang" or "DNA overhang" refers to the single-stranded portion at the end of a double- stranded DNA molecule. Complementary overhangs are those which will base-pair with each other. [0070] The term "Selectable marker" refers to a polynucleotide segment that allows one to select for or against a molecule or a cell that contains it, often under particular conditions. These markers can encode an activity, such as, but not limited to, production of RNA, peptide, or protein, or can provide a binding site for RNA, peptides, proteins, inorganic and organic compounds or compositions. Examples of Selectable markers include but are not limited to: (1) DNA segments that encode products which provide resistance against otherwise toxic compounds (e.g., antibiotics); (2) DNA segments that encode products which are otherwise lacking in the recipient cell (e.g., tRNA genes, auxotrophic markers); (3) DNA segments that encode products which suppress the activity of a gene product; (4) DNA segments that encode products which can be readily identified (e.g., phenotypic markers such as beta-galactosidase, green fluorescent protein (GFP), and cell surface proteins); (5) DNA segments that bind products which are otherwise detrimental to cell survival and/or function; (6) DNA segments that otherwise inhibit the activity of any of the DNA segments described in Nos. 1-5 above (e.g., antisense oligonucleotides); (7) DNA segments that bind products that modify a substrate (e.g. restriction endonucleases); (8) DNA segments that can be used to isolate a desired molecule (e.g. specific protein binding sites); (9) DNA segments that encode a specific nucleotide sequence which can be otherwise non-functional (e.g., for PCR amplification of subpopulations of molecules); and/or (10) DNA segments, which when absent, directly or indirectly confer sensitivity to particular compounds. [0071] The term "Counter Selectable Marker" refers to a polynucleotide sequence that confers a selective disadvantage upon a host cell. Examples of counter-selectable markers include sacB, rpsL, tetAR, pheS, thy A, gata-1, ccdB, kid and barnase (Bernard, 1995, Journal/Gene, 162: 159-160; Bernard et al., 1994. Journal/Gene, 148: 71-74; Gabant et al., 1997, Journal/Biotechniques, 23: 938-941 ; Gababt et al., 1998, Journal/Gene, 207: 87-92; Gababt et al., 2000, Journal/ Biotechniques, 28: 784-788; Galvao and de Lorenzo, 2005, Journal/ Appl Environ Microbiol, 71 : 883-892; Hartzog et al., 2005, Journal/Yeat, 22:789- 798; Knipfer et al., 1997, Journal/Plasmid, 37: 129-140; Reyrat et al., 1998, Journal/Infect Immun, 66: 4011-4017; Soderholm et al., 2001 , Journal Biotechniques, 31 : 306-310, 312; Tamura et al., 2005, Journal/ Appl Environ Microbiol, 71 : 587-590; Yazynin et al., 1999, Journal/FEBS Lett, 452: 351-354). Counter-selectable markers often confer their selective disadvantage in specific contexts. For example they may confer sensitivity to compounds that can be added to the environment of the host cell, or they may kill a host with one genotype but not kill a host with a different genotype. Conditions which do not confer a selective disadvantage upon a cell carrying a counter- selectable marker are described as "permissive". Conditions which do confer a selective disadvantage upon a cell carrying a counter- selectable marker are described as "restrictive". [0072] The term "Recognition sequence" refers to particular DNA sequences which are recognized (and bound by) a protein, DNA, or RNA molecule, including a restriction endonuclease, a modification methylase, and a recombinase. For example, the recognition sequence for Cre recombinase is loxP which is a 34 base pair sequence comprised of two 13 base pair inverted repeats (serving as the recombinase binding sites) flanking an 8 base pair core sequence. See FIG. 1 of Sauer, B., Current Opinion in Biotechnology 5:521-527 (1994). Other examples of recognition sequences are the attB, attP, attL, and attR sequences which are recognized by the integrase of bacteriophage lambda. AttB is an approximately 25 base pair sequence containing two 9 base pair core-type Int binding sites and a 7 base pair overlap region. attP is an approximately 240 base pair sequence containing core-type Int binding sites and arm-type Int binding sites as well as sites for auxiliary proteins IHF, FIS, and Xis. See Landy, Current Opinion in Biotechnology 3:699-707 (1993). Such sites are also engineered according to the present invention to enhance methods and products. [0073] The term "Recombinase" refers to an enzyme which catalyzes the exchange of DNA segments at specific recombination sites. [0074] The term "Recombinational Cloning" refers to a method described herein, whereby segments of DNA molecules are exchanged, inserted, replaced, substituted or modified, in vitro or in vivo. [0075] The term "Recombination proteins" includes excisive or integrative proteins, enzymes, co-factors or associated proteins that are involved in recombination reactions involving one or more recombination sites. See, Landy (1994), infra. [0076] The term "expression system" refers to any in vivo or in vitro biological system that is used to produce one or more polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide. [0077] The term "annealing temperature" or "melting temperature" or "transition temperature" refers to the temperature at which a pair of nucleic acids is in a state intermediate between being fully annealed and fully melted. The term refers to the behavior of a population of nucleic acids: the "annealing temperature" or "melting temperature" or "transition temperature" is the temperature at which 50% of the molecules are annealed and 50% are separate. Annealing temperatures can be determined experimentally. There are also methods well known in the art for calculating these temperatures. [0078] The term "translation" refers to the process by which a polypeptide is synthesized by a ribosome 'reading' the sequence of a polynucleotide. [0079] The term "selectable protein" refers to a protein that provides a physical, chemical or biological method for selecting cells on the basis of how much of the selectable protein is expressed. [0080] The term "coupling element" refers to a DNA sequence that allows the expression of a first polypeptide to be linked to the expression of a second polypeptide. Internal ribosome binding sites (IRES elements) and cis-acting hydrolase elements (CHYSEL elements) are examples of coupling elements. [0081] The phrase "predetermined time period" refers to a specified amount of time. A "predetermined period of time" can be on the order of seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months. For example, a "predetermined time period" can be between 1 and 59 minutes, or any increment between 1 and 2 hours, or any increment between 2 and 4 hours, or any increment between 4 and 6 hours, or any increment between 6 and 12 hours, or any increment between 12 and 24 hours, or any increment between 1 day and 2 days, or any increment between 2 days and 4 days, and any increment between 4 days and 7 days, and any increment between 1 week and 4 weeks, and any increment between 1 month and 12 months, or any combination of incremental time periods therein. [0082] The term "typells restriction enzyme" is used herein to refer to any restriction enzyme that cleaves DNA at a defined distance outside its recognition sequence, and whose recognition sequence is non-palindromic. [0083] The terms "ligatable ends" or "compatible ends" are used herein to describe two ends of polynucleotide molecules that are both blunt or that both possess overhangs of the same length and directionality (i.e. both are 5'-overhangs, or both are 3'-overhangs) and with perfectly complementary sequences, such that the DNA ends form standard Watson-Crick base pairs (i.e. C with G and T or U with A) and can be joined by a DNA ligase. [0084] The term "operably linked" refers to functional linkage between two sequences such that one sequence modifies the behavior of the other. For example a first polynucleotide comprising a nucleic acid expression control sequence (such as a promoter, IRES sequence, enhancer or array of transcription factor binding sites) and a second polynucleotide are operably linked if the first polynucleotide affects transcription and/or translation of the second polynucleotide. Similarly a first amino acid sequence comprising a secretion signal or a subcellular localization signal and a second amino acid sequence are operably linked if the first amino acid sequence causes the second amino acid sequence to be secreted or localized to a subcellular location. [0085] A "promoter" means a nucleic acid sequence sufficient to direct transcription of an operably linked nucleic acid molecule. Also included in this definition are those transcription control elements (for example, enhancers) that are sufficient to render promoter-dependent gene expression controllable in a cell type-specific, tissue-specific, or temporal-specific manner, or that are inducible by external signals or agents; such elements, which are well- known to skilled artisans, may be found in a 5' or 3' region of a gene or within an intron. Desirably, a promoter is operably linked to a nucleic acid sequence, for example, a cDNA or a gene sequence, or an effector RNA coding sequence, in such a way as to enable expression of the nucleic acid sequence, or a promoter is provided in an expression cassette into which a selected nucleic acid sequence to be transcribed can be conveniently inserted. [0086] 'Integration defective' means a transposase that integrates a transposon at a lower frequency into the host genome than a corresponding wild type transposase. [0087] As used herein, the term "transposon" or "transposable element" refers to a polynucleotide that can be excised from a first polynucleotide, for instance, a vector, and be integrated into a second position in the same polynucleotide, or into a second polynucleotide, for instance, the genomic or extrachromosomal DNA of a cell, by the action of a trans-acting transposase. A transposon comprises a first transposon end and a second transposon end which are polynucleotide sequences recognized by and transposed by a transposase. A transposon usually further comprises a first polynucleotide sequence between the two transposon ends, such that the first polynucleotide sequence is transposed along with the two transposon ends by the action of the transposase. Natural transposons frequently comprise DNA encoding a transposase that acts upon the transposon. The invention provides transposons in which a naturally present sequence encoding a functional transposase has been replaced with a sequence encoding a heterologous polynucleotide, which is transposable by virtue of its juxtaposition between the transposon ends. [0088] As used herein, the term "transposon end" refers to cis-acting nucleotide sequences that are sufficient for recognition by and transposition by a transposase. A pair of transposon ends typically comprises paired perfect or imperfect repeats such that the respective repeats in the members of a pair are reverse complements of each other in the two different transposon ends. These are referred to as inverted terminal repeats (ITR) or terminal inverted repeats (TIR). In piggyBac-like transposons, each transposon end further comprises a target sequence immediately distal to the ITR (distal meaning on the side further from the transposase or heterologous polynucleotide transposed by the ITR). A transposon end may or may not include additional sequence proximal to the ITR that promotes or augments transposition. [0089] As used herein, a "piggyBac-like transposase" means a transposase with at least 20% and preferably at least 30% sequence identity as identified using the TBLASTN algorithm to the piggyBac transposase from Trichopiusia ni (SEQ ID NO. 57) , and as more fully described in Sakar, A. et. al , (2003). Mol. Gen. Genomics 270: 173-180. "Molecular evolutionary analysis of the widespread piggyBac transposon family and related 'domesticated' species", and further characterized by a DDE-like DDD motif, with aspartate residues at positions corresponding to D268, D346, and D447 of Trichoplusia ni piggyBac transposase on maximal alignment. A "piggyBac-like transposon" means a transposon having transposon ends which are the same or at least 80% and preferably at least 90, 95, 96, 97, 98 or 99% identical to the transposon ends of a naturally occurring transposon that encodes a piggyback- like transposase. A piggyBac-like transposon includes an inverted repeat sequence of approximately 13 bases at each end, immediately adjacent to a sequence corresponding to the target sequence which is duplicated upon transposon integration (the Target Site Duplication or Target Sequence Duplication or TSD). piggyBac-like transposons and transposases have been identified in a wide range of organisms including Argyrogramma agnate (GU477713), Anopheles gambiae (XP_312615; XP_320414; XP_310729), Aphis gossypii (GU329918), Acyrthosiphon pisum (XP_001948139), Agrotis ypsilon (GU477714), Bombyx mori (BAD11135), Ciona intestinalis (XP_002123602), Chilo suppressalis (JX294476), Drosophila melanogaster (AAL39784), Daphnia pulicaria (AAM76342), Helicoverpa armigera (ABS18391), Homo sapiens (NP_689808), Heliothis virescens (ABD76335), Macdunnoughia crassisigna (EU287451), Macaca fascicularis (AB179012), Mus musculus (NP_741958), Pectinophora gossypiella (GU270322), Rattus norvegicus (XP_220453), Tribolium castaneum (XP_001814566), Trichoplusia ni (AAA87375) and Xenopus tropicalis (BAF82026). [0090] A target nucleic acid is a nucleic acid into which a transposon is to be inserted. Such a target can be part of a chromosome, episome or vector. The target nucleic acid for a transposon of the present invention should contain at least one motif recognized by a transpose of the present invention ( 5'-TTAT-3' or 5'-TTAA-3'). [0091] As used herein, a "target site" or "target sequence" for a transposase is a site or sequence in a target DNA molecule into which a transposon can be inserted by a transposase. The piggyBac transposase from Trichoplusia ni inserts its transposon into the target sequence 5'-TTAA-3'. [0092] As used herein, the term 'transposase' refers to a polypeptide that catalyzes the excision of a transposon from a donor polynucleotide, for example a vector, and (providing the transposase is not integration-deficient) the subsequent integration of the transposon into the genomic or extrachromosomal DNA of a target cell. The transposase binds a transposon end. The transposase may be present as a polypeptide. Alternatively, the transposase is present as a polynucleotide that includes a coding sequence encoding a transposase. The polynucleotide can be RNA, for instance an mRNA encoding the transposase, or DNA, for instance a coding sequence encoding the transposase. When the transposase is present as a coding sequence encoding the transposase, in some aspects of the invention the coding sequence may be present on the same vector that includes the transposon, that is, in cis. In other aspects of the invention, the transposase coding sequence may be present on a second vector, that is, in trans. [0093] "IRES" or "internal ribosome entry site" means a specialized sequence that directly promotes ribosome binding, independen of a cap structure. [0094] "Open Reading Frame" or ORF means a portion of a DNA molecule that, when translated into amino acids, contains no stop codons. The genetic code reads DNA sequences in groups of three base pairs, which means that a double- stranded DNA molecule can read in any of six possible reading frames-three in the forward direction and three in the reverse. A long open reading frame is likely a part of a gene. [0095] Two elements are heterologous to one another if not naturally associated. For example, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein linked to a heterologous promoter means a promoter other than that which naturally expresses the protein. A heterologous nucleic acid flanked by transposon ends or ITRs means a heterologous nucleic acid not naturally flanked by those transposon ends or ITRs, such as a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide other than a transposase, including an antibody heavy or light chain. Heterologous nucleic acids flanked by transposon ends or ITRs can vary in length, for example ranging from 20 base pairs to 20 kilo base pairs or more. A nucleic acid is heterologous to a cell if not normally found in the cell or in a different location (e.g., episomal or different genomic location) than the location naturally present within a cell. [0096] Sequence identity can be determined by aligning sequences using algorithms, such as BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), using default gap parameters, or by inspection, and the best alignment (i.e., resulting in the highest percentage of sequence similarity over a comparison window). Percentage of sequence identity is calculated by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a window of comparison, determining the number of positions at which the identical residues occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of matched and mismatched positions not counting gaps in the window of comparison (i.e., the window size), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. Unless otherwise indicated the window of comparison between two sequences is defined by the entire length of the shorter of the two sequences. [0097] For purposes of classifying amino acids substitutions as conservative or nonconservative, amino acids are grouped as follows: Group I (hydrophobic sidechains): norleucine, met, ala, val, leu, ile; Group II (neutral hydrophilic side chains): cys, ser, thr; Group III (acidic side chains): asp, glu; Group IV (basic side chains): asn, gin, his, lys, arg; Group V (residues influencing chain orientation): gly, pro; and Group VI (aromatic side chains): trp, tyr, phe. Conservative substitutions involve substitutions between amino acids in the same class. Non-conservative substitutions constitute exchanging a member of one of these classes for a member of another. [0098] The "configuration" of a polynucleotide means the functional sequence elements within the polynucleotide, and the order and direction of those elements. For example Tables 6 - 18 5.2 DESCRIPTION 5.2.1 VECTOR COMPONENTS [0099] The properties of a biological system including natural as well as non-natural systems with respect to any measurable function depends on the interaction between different nucleic acid sequence elements, which may be located at positions throughout the total nucleic acid component of the system, herein referred to as the "nucleic acid construct" of the system. The ability to rationally design a nucleic acid construct with an optimal configuration of elements is advantageous for various applications such as protein synthesis via vector optimization, cell line development and strain engineering. Protein synthesis is a highly dynamic and multi- step process and which plays a central role in synthetic biology, pharmaceutical production and other applications in biotechnology. This importance has led to the development of various parts or genetic control elements able to modulate and precisely control various aspects of protein expression. This capability is not only essential for the successful construction of more complex synthetic biological systems, but also provides tools needed for the tuning of their function for improved performance and reliability. [00100] A limitation with the current state of the art is that effects of many control elements are dependent on the genetic context in which they are used. For example, combining the same promoter with different RBSs and genes can result in very different levels of expression. [00101] While effects of combinations of one or two transcriptional or translational elements have been studied including the genetic context in which they are used, there remains a need in the art to identify optimal configurations of multiple functional elements. Such elements can include those that influence DNA copy number, sites of DNA integration into chromosomes, RNA transcription rate, RNA degradation, RNA processing, RNA localization, translation initiation rate, and transcriptional termination. Examples of such elements are promoters, enhancers, introns, polyadenylation signals, ribosome binding sites, Kozak sequences, 5' untranslated sequences, origins of replication, nuclear export signals, internal ribosome entry sites and transcriptional terminators. Functional elements may also include those that encode functional polypeptides, such as secretion signals, resistance markers, anchoring peptides, localization signals, fusion tags, affinity tags, chaperonins and proteases. The ability to rationally engineer multiple elements within the DNA content of a host cell or expression system is an important aspect of this invention. In another embodiment, engineering of multiple elements within the DNA content of host cell or expression system along with variables of environmental stress or culture conditions is another aspect of this invention. Such environmental variables can include media components (whether complex or defined media), aeration, temperature, matrix for growth and others. 5.2.2 GENOMIC INTEGRATION [00102] In some embodiments, the nucleic acid construct is a vector with enhanced expression and integration properties. For example, an optimal configuration of vector elements for enhanced transient expression as well as more efficient stable integration and expression was identified by the methods described herein. A mammalian vector construct variant set was generated using multiple combinations of various transposon ends or insulators, enhancers, promoters, introns, 5' untranslated regions (UTRs), 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), RNA export modulating sequence, polyadenylation sequences, terminators and matrix attachment element. The mammalian vector variant set was used to express DasherGFP in Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Vector constructs with different promoter combinations were also shown to affect DasherGFP expression. Further optimization of this vector construct for different cell lines using the methods described herein is expressly contemplated. An advantage of the methods described herein is to quickly identify a subset of sequence elements most likely to influence desired activity as well as to facilitate predictable construction of optimal configuration of elements. [00103] In some embodiments, elements that are useful in enhancing performance may include those localized to the genomic DNA of a cell. For example expression may be influenced by the levels of RNA polymerases, chaperonins, proteases, processing enzymes, or other factor encoded by DNA on the cell chromosome. It might also be advantageous to augment the host chromosome with functional elements that influence performance. In some embodiments, a variable for engineering is the site at which a functional gene is integrated into a host cell chromosome. [00104] In some embodiments, the nucleic acid construct is a polynucleotide comprising of elements or combinations of elements arranged in an optimal configuration. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide is linear. In some embodiments, the elements in a nucleic acid construct comprise functional genetic features, for example, promoters, enhancers, introns, polyadenylation signals, origins of replication, and terminators. In some embodiments, the elements in a nucleic acid construct comprise protein encoding elements such as secretion signals, resistance markers, anchoring peptides, localization signals, and fusion tags. In some embodiments, the plurality of elements comprises three or more elements, six or more elements, between three and twenty elements or between three and hundred elements. In some embodiments, nucleic acid construct variants include substitutions in a single element comprising one or more positions, three or more positions, six or more positions. In some embodiments, nucleic acid variants include substitutions wherein the substitutions are variations in elements and/or presence or absence of elements. In some embodiments, the substitutions include changes in the position of one or more elements. In some embodiments, nucleic acid variants include a change in the order of one or more elements. 5.2.3 NOVEL TRANSPOSONS [00105] DNA transposons undergo a 'cut and paste' system of replication in which the elements are physically excised from the one DNA molecule and reinserted in a second. The DNA transposons are characterized by inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) and are mobilized by an element-encoded transposase. [00106] While DNA transposons are widespread and active in a variety of eukaryotes, they have been thought to be transpositionally inactive in mammalian genomes. [00107] The natural process of horizontal gene transfer can be mimicked under laboratory conditions. In plants, transposons of the Ac/Ds and Spm families have been routinely transfected into heterologous species. In animals, however, a considerable obstacle to the transfer of an active transposon system from one species to another has been that of species- specificity of transposition due to the requirement for factors produced by the natural host. [00108] A number of transposable elements have been described in the art that show no host-restriction in vertebrates, for example, an engineered transposon from the genome of salmonid fish called Sleeping Beauty; piggyBac transposon from lepidopteran cells; piggyBat transposon from the bat Myotis lucifugus; mariner transposon first discovered in Drosophila and; an engineered transposon and transposon inverted repeats from the frog species, Rana pipiens called frog prince; but the efficiency of transposition in cell lines derived from different species is variable. Therefore, it is advantageous to have a palette of different transposons with different host preferences to widen the potential of transposons as genomic tools in vertebrates. [00109] It is currently used for many purposes including genome editing, enhancer trapping, gene discovery and identifying gene function in insects and mammals. The piggyBac transposon / transposase system is particularly useful because of the precision with which the transposon is integrated and excised (see for example "Fraser, M. J. (2001) The TTAA- Specific Family of Transposable Elements: Identification, Functional Characterization, and Utility for Transformation of Insects. Insect Transgenesis: Methods and Applications. A. M. Handler and A. A. James. Boca Raton, Fla., CRC Press: 249-268"; and "US 20070204356 Al : PiggyBac constructs in vertebrates" and references therein). This integration and excision is shown schematically in Figure 1. [00110] Many sequences with sequence similarity to the piggyBac transposase from Trichoplusia ni have been found in the genomes of phylogenetically distinct species from fungi to mammals, but very few have been shown to possess transposase activity (see for example Wu M, et al (2011) Genetica 139: 149-54. Cloning and characterization of piggyBac - like elements in lepidopteran insects, and references therein). To discover novel transposons and transposases capable of transposing a heterologous polynucleotide into the genome of a host cell, we identified the sequences of 14 putative transposases (SEQ ID NO: 43-56) by searching public sequence databases for polypeptides with sequence similarity to known active transposases. We then identified their corresponding transposon ends by taking the non-coding region associated with the gene sequence of the transposase. We designed and synthesized a polynucleotide to express each of the 14 transposases under control of the CMV promoter, and a second polynucleotide to express each of the 14 transposases fused to a heterologous nuclear localization signal under control of the CMV promoter. For each transposase we further designed two corresponding transposons. The first transposon comprised a heterologous polynucleotide comprising a puromycin resistance gene under control of a murine PGK promoter and a DasherGFP gene under control of a human EFla promoter, with the two promoters oriented such that transcription from them is in opposite directions and divergent, surrounded by a pair of transposon ends. Sequences of transposon ends and corresponding transposases are described in Example 6.1.1 and shown in Tables 1 and 2. The second transposon comprised a heterologous polynucleotide comprising a puromycin resistance gene under control of a murine PGK promoter, with a DasherGFP gene translationally coupled to the puromycin-resistance gene through a CHYSEL sequence, surrounded by a pair of transposon ends. Sequences of transposon ends and corresponding transposases are described in Example 6.1.4 and shown in Table 5. We then transfected each transposon into CHO cells, in parallel sets with or without its corresponding transposase. Transposases that increased the reporter fluorescence from their transposons relative to the transposon-alone comprised novel transposon-transposase pairs that could integrate a heterologous polynucleotide into the genome of a cell. [00111] As described in Examples 6.6.1 and 6.1.4 and shown in Tables 1 , 2 and 5, of 14 that we identified and synthesized, only 4 showed detectable transposase activity. Thus sequence similarity to the Trichoplusia ni piggyBac sequence is insufficient to characterize a sequence as a transposase. [00112] Using this method, we have identified two novel active piggyBac-like transposases together with their transposon ends and the ITR sequences on which they act. [00113] One transposon was identified from the genome of Xenopus tropicalis with functional transposon ends being contained within SEQ ID NOS: 5, 6. Two transposases that can recognize and transpose these transposon ends are SEQ ID NOS: 45 and 46. Excision activity has been identified in Txb transposases from Xenopus (Hikosaka et. al. , Mol. Biol. Evol., 24(12):2648-2656, 2007), but the authors conclude "In the present study, we demonstrated that the Xtr-Uribo2 Tpase has excision activity toward the target transposon, although there is no evidence for the integration of the excised target into the genome" Here we have identified transposon ends including ITRs that can be placed at either end of a heterologous polynucleotide sequence to effect the efficient integration of the polynucleotide into genomic DNA by the action of the Xenopus transposase. Gene transfer vectors comprising Xenopus transposon ends and with optimal configurations of vector elements described herein (Section 5.2.6) show stable genomic integration even in the absence of transposase. In the presence of transposase, the expression from stably integrated transposons is increased 3-70 fold (see for example Table 14). [00114] One transposon was identified from the genome of Bombyx mori with the functional transposon ends being contained within SEQ ID NOS: 1 , 2. A transposase that can recognize and transpose a transposon comprising these transposon ends is SEQ ID NOS: 44. We noted that the transposon end sequence associated with SEQ ID NO: 43 (SEQ ID NOS: 121 and 122) were terminated by the canonical 5'-TTAA-3' integration sequence always observed for transposons with significant sequence identity to Trichoplusia ni piggyBac. In contrast the transposon end sequence associated with SEQ ID NO: 44 (SEQ ID NOS: 1 and 2) were terminated by 5'-TTAT-3' sequences adjacent to the ITRs. We did not initially know whether this indicated that the transposase really used a novel integration sequence. Previous studies have indicated that the Trichoplusia ni piggyBac transposase is unable to transpose a transposon whose ends comprise a target sequence other than 5'-TTAA-3' (Mitra et al (2008) EMBO Journal 27: 1097-1109 "piggyBac can bypass DNA synthesis during cut and paste transposition"). Alternative possibilities for the 5'-TTAT-3' target sequence in the transposon ends within SEQ ID NOS: 1 , 2 included sequencing errors or that the transposon had mutated and the transposase was no longer capable of transposing the sequence. Because active piggyBac-like transposons have only been described to use 5'-TTAA-3' integration sequences, we added the sequence 5'-TTAA-3' to both ends of the Bombyx transposon when we synthesized it to maximize the chance that we could reconstitute an active transposon (so the transposon sequence was arranged 5'-TTAATTAT-transposon end 1 -heterologous polynucleotide - transposon end 2 - TTATTTAA-3'). Contrary to the claims of Daimon et al (who describe Bombyx transposases as being essentially inactive, see Daimon T et al, 2010. Genome. 53:585-93. "Recent transposition of yabusame, a novel piggyBac-like transposable element in the genome of the silkworm, Bombyx mori.") we found that the Bombyx transposon was highly active (see Examples 6.6.1 and Tables 1 and 2), we wished to determine its integration sequence. As shown in Figure 1, when a piggyBac-like transposon is transposed, it leaves a single copy of its target sequence in the DNA from which it is excised. We therefore sequenced plasmids from which transposons had been excised by transposases. Figure 2 shows a sequence trace file from a plasmid from which the Bombyx transposon has been excised. Both copies of the 5'-TTAA-3' sequence that we placed around the transposon ends are still present; however only a single copy of the 5' -TTAT-3' site remains. We examined 16 independent transposition events from Bombyx transposons, and all 16 left only a single perfectly intact copy of the 5'-TTAT-3' integration sequence. In contrast, when we examined 16 independent transposition events from Xenopus transposons, all 16 left only a single perfectly intact copy of the 5'-TTAA-3' integration sequence. Both Xenopus and Bombyx transposons disclosed here are transposed by their respective transposases with the same precision as has been described for Trichoplusia ni piggyBac, a precision which is highly advantageous for any genomic modifications that may be desirable to make reversibly. In contrast to Trichoplusia ni piggyBac, however, the Bombyx mori transposon thus comprises a 5'-TTAT-3' integration sequence, and the Bombyx mori transposase can excise and integrate Bombyx mori transposons at 5'-TTAT-3' recognition sequences. This is in contrast to all other known transposases with homology to Trichoplusia ni piggyBac, all of which recognize and insert transposons at the sequence 5'-TTAA-3'. This difference may be highly advantageous: Trichoplusia ni piggyBac has a preference for inserting transposons into transcriptionally inactive DNA. Because 5'-TTAT-3' is a reverse complement of 5'-ATAA-3' which is part of the canonical mammalian polyA signal 5'- aATAAa-3'. Thus the 5'-TTAT-3' insertion site recognized by the Bombyx mori transposase will occur at almost every polyA signal. PolyA signals are associated with transcriptionally active regions of the chromosome. Thus transposons that insert at 5'-TTAT-3' sites, including the Bombyx mori transposons, are likely to yield higher expression levels of the genes they carry than transposons that insert 5'-TTAA-3' sites. [00115] The invention provides a heterologous polynucleotide flanked by inverted repeats, which are in turn flanked by a direct repeat of the target sequence, 5'-TTAT-3'. In other words, from 5' to 3' such polynucleotides comprise a 5'-TTAT-3' target sequence, an ITR, a heterologous polynucleotide not naturally flanked by the ITR and 5'-TTAT-3', a second ITR in reverse orientation to the first ITR, and a second 5'-TTAT-3' target sequence. Transposition of such a transposon by a transposase leaves a single 5'-TTAT-3' motif in the locus previously occupied in a transposon. The transposon is transposed to a second polynucleotide including a 5'-TTAT-3' motif to generate a modified second polynucleotide including the transposon with the same components as when the transposon occupied the first polynucleotide. [00116] The present application discloses a piggyBac-like Bombyx transposon (AB 162707.1 GI:42600553) comprising transposon ends (each end including an ITR) corresponding to SEQ ID NO. 1 and 2, which has a target sequence corresponding to 5'-TTAT-3'. It also comprises a sequence encoding a transposase (SEQ ID NO. 44). A previously described Bombyx transposon (AB159601.1 GI:41016737) comprises one transposon end also identical to SEQ ID NO. 1 and a second transposon end corresponding to SEQ ID NO. 122. SEQ ID NO, 122 is very similar to SEQ ID NO. 2, but has a large insertion shortly before the ITR. Although the ITR sequences for the two transposons are identical (they are both identical to SEQ ID NO. 32), they have different target sequences: the second transposon has a target sequence corresponding to 5'-TTAA-3', providing evidence that no change in ITR sequence is necessary to modify the target sequence specificity. The Bombyx transposase (SEQ ID NO: 43), which is associated with the 5'-TTAA-3' target site differs from the 5'- TTAT-3'-associated transposase (SEQ ID NO: 44) by only 4 amino acid changes ( D322Y, S473C, A507T, H582R). The transposase (SEQ ID NO: 43), which is associated with the 5'-TTAA-3' target site is less active than the 5'-TTAT-3'-associated transposase (SEQ ID NO: 44) on the transposon with 5'-TTAT-3' ends (see for example Table 5). These results provide evidence that other transposons with 5'-TTAA-3' target duplication sites can be converted to transposases with 5'-TTAT-3' target duplication sites by replacing 5'-TTAA-3' target duplication sites with 5'-TTAT-3'. Such novel transposons can be used either with Bombyx transposase (SEQ ID NO:43), which recognizes the 5'-TTAT-3' target sequence, or with a variant of the transposase originally associate with the 5'-TTAA-3' transposon. The high similarity between Bombyx 5'-TTAA-3' and 5'-TTAT-3' transposases provides evidence that very few changes to the amino acid sequence of a piggyBac-like transposase may confer altered target sequence specificity. The invention therefore provides transposon transposase transfer systems which can be formed by modification of any piggyBac-like transposon- transposase gene transfer system of which there are many known examples, in which 5'- TTAA-3' target sequences are replaced with 5'-TTAT-3'-target sequences, the ITRs remain the same, and the transposase is the original transposase or a variant thereof resulting from using a low-level mutagenesis to introduce mutations into the transposase. Similarly the invention also provides transposon transposase transfer systems which can be formed by modification of a 5'-TTAT-3'-active piggyBac-like transposon-transposase gene transfer system such as the Bombyx system disclosed herein, in which 5'-TTAT-3' target sequences are replaced with 5'-TTAA-3'-target sequences, the ITRs remain the same, and the transposase is the original transposase or a variant thereof resulting from using a low-level mutagenesis to introduce mutations into the transposase. [00117] Transposases that are active on a new target sequence such as a 5'-TTAT-3' target sequence can be selected, for example by coupling transposon excision to the production of a full coding sequence for a selectable marker. A transposon whose ITRs are flanked by the new target sequences (for example 5'-TTAT-3' target sequences) can be inserted into a selectable marker such that expression of the selectable marker is prevented. For example the transposon may be in the middle of an open reading frame encoding a selectable marker such that the presence of the transposon prevents the translation of a functional version of the selectable marker, or the transposon may be in an intron within an open reading frame encoding a selectable marker, such that the presence of the transposon prevents the splicing of the intron and thus prevents synthesis of the selectable marker. The transposon is placed such that when it is excised, the selectable marker regains functionality. For example the transposon may be placed at the sequence 5'-TTAT-3' within the coding sequence for a selectable marker such as an auxotrophic marker; the precise excision of the transposon from the open reading frame of the selectable marker restores the coding sequence of the selectable marker. A gene encoding the transposon-interrupted selectable marker and a gene encoding a transposase are introduced into a cell. The cell is then subjected to restrictive conditions that require expression of the selectable marker to enable the cell to survive. Expression of the selectable marker in turn depends upon excision of the transposon which in turn requires an active transposase. Cell survival can thus be used to identify active transposases. An example of such a selection scheme has been described by Yusa et al (Yusa et.al., PNAS, vol 108, no.4, 1531-1536, 2011). [00118] A transposase with modified activity, either for activity on a new target sequence including a 5'-TTAT-3' target sequence, or increased activity on an existing target sequence may be obtained by using variations of the selection scheme outlined above. To create the modified transposase, an existing transposase is used as a starting point, for example any of SEQ ID NOS: 43-57 or any other piggyBac-like transposase. One or more variant transposase sequences are created. These can be created in a variety of different ways, for example the gene may be subjected to random mutagenesis; the gene may be "DNA shuffled" with one or more homologous genes; systematic substitutions may be introduced into the gene including the creation of all possible single amino acid substitutions; substitutions may be introduced based on phylogenetic analysis and other rules for example as described in US Patent 8,635,029 B2. The sequence encoding the one or more variant transposases are operably linked to a promoter such that the transposases may be expressed in a cell. Each variant transposase is introduced into a cell that contains the transposon-interrupted transposable marker, and the cell is then subjected to restrictive conditions for which it requires the active selectable marker to survive. When a transposase is able to excise the transposon the cell will survive, and the gene encoding the active transposase may be recovered from the cell, for example by PCR. The process may be performed in pools of variants: a more active transposase will create active selectable markers more frequently, and will thus be more highly represented in the population. [00119] A comparable process may be used to increase the transposability of the transposon ends by a transposase. In this case, the transposon may comprise a first active selectable marker. Transposon ends may be selected from any of SEQ ID NOS: 1-31 or 32-42 or from any other piggyBac-like transposon including those associated with the inverted terminal repeats shown in SEQ ID NOS: 125-130. The sequence of one or both transposon ends may be subjected to random or pre-determined sequence changes, including changes to the target sequence, the ITR or to other parts of the transposon ends. The transposon may then be introduced into a first cell that contains a target polynucleotide comprising a second active selectable marker and an active transposase. If the transposase is able to transpose the transposon, some fraction of the transposons will be transposed into the target polynucleotide. The target polynucleotide is purified from the first cell, and introduced into a second cell which is subjected to restrictive conditions for which it requires the first selectable marker and the second selectable marker to survive. The transposon may be recovered, for example by sequencing out from the transposon to identify the flanking sequence, and then amplifying the transposon using PCR. The process may be performed in pools of variants: a more active transposon will create target polynucleotides containing both selectable markers more frequently, and will thus be more highly represented in the population. In this process, the transposon may optionally be present as a reversible interruption in a selectable marker as described for the transposase activity screen. However this is not necessary for the transposon activity screen, since the transposed transposons are detected directly. [00120] These new transposases allow effective insertion of a transposon into a eukaryotic cell, including a mammalian cell such as a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell or a Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell. [00121] As well as exemplified transposases having sequences SEQ ID NOS. 43, 44, 45 and 46, the invention provides variants having at least 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 or 99% sequence identity to an exemplified sequence retaining transposase activity. Variations can be conservative or non-conservative substitutions, insertions and deletions. Deletions can be from the N-terminal or C-terminal end or internal. Some variants resulting from alanine scanning mutagenesis contain an alanine substitution at single positions throughout the molecule. Variations retain transposase activity on a transposon in which the exemplified transposase is activity. We have identified active transposases from Bombyx mori (SEQ ID NOS: 44) and Xenopus tropicalis (SEQ ID NOS: 45 and 46) that show variations in at least 4 residues that serve as a starting point for further studies for identification of hyperactive variants and integration deficient variants that retain excision activity. As used herein a Bombyx mori transposase or a Bombyx transposase refers to a polypeptide with at least 90% sequence identity with SEQ ID NO: 44 that can recognize and transpose a transposon. In some embodiments the transposon comprises two transposon ends, each of which comprises SEQ ID NO: 32 in inverted orientations in the two transposon ends. As used herein a Xenopus tropicalis transposase or a Xenopus transposase refers to a polypeptide with at least 90% sequence identity with SEQ ID NO: 45 or SEQ ID NO: 46 that can recognize and transpose a transposon. In some embodiments the transposon comprises two transposon ends each of which comprise SEQ ID NO: 42 in inverted orientations in the two transposon ends. [00122] These new transposases allow effective insertion of a transposon into a eukaryotic cell, including a mammalian cell such as a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell or a Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell. [00123] As well as exemplified transposases having sequences SEQ ID NOS. 43, 44, 45 and 46, the invention provides variants having at least 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98 or 99% sequence identity to an exemplified sequence retaining transposase activity. Variations can be conservative or non-conservative substitutions, insertions and deletions. Deletions can be from the N-terminal or C-terminal end or internal. Some variants resulting from alanine scanning mutagenesis contain an alanine substitution at single positions throughout the molecule. Variations retain transposase activity on a transposon in which the exemplified transposase is activity. We have identified active variants of transposases from Bombyx mori (SEQ ID NOS: 43 and 44) and Xenopus tropicalis (SEQ ID NOS: 45 and 46) that show variations in at least 4 residues that serve as a starting point for further studies for identification of hyperactive variants and integration deficient variants that retain excision activity. As used herein a Bombyx mori transposase or a Bombyx transposase refers to a polypeptide with at least 90% sequence identity with SEQ ID NO: 43 or SEQ ID NO: 44 that can recognize and transpose a transposon. In some embodiments the transposon comprises two transposon ends, each of which comprises SEQ ID NO: 32 in inverted orientations in the two transposon ends. As used herein a Xenopus tropicalis transposase or a Xenopus transposase refers to a polypeptide with at least 90% sequence identity with SEQ ID NO: 45 or SEQ ID NO: 46 that can recognize and transpose a transposon. In some embodiments the transposon comprises two transposon ends each of which comprise SEQ ID NO: 42 in inverted orientations in the two transposon ends. [00124] The invention also provides variants of exemplified sequences of transposon ends. The Bombyx transposase recognizes a transposon with a left sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 1 , and a right sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 2. It will excise the transposon from one DNA molecule by cutting the DNA at the 5'-TTAT-3' sequence at the left end of one transposon end to the 5'-TTAT-3' at the right end of the second transposon end, including any heterologous DNA that is placed between them, and insert the excised sequence into a second DNA molecule. Truncated and modified versions of the left and right transposon ends will also function as part of a transposon that can be transposed by the Bombyx transposase. For example the left transposon end can be replaced by a shorter sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 3, or the right transposon end can be replaced by a shorter sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 4. It is thus expressly contemplated that modified versions of the transposon end sequences will be tolerated by the transposase, and may even result in increased transposition. In addition, we note that the left and right transposon ends share a 16 bp repeat sequence at their ends (SEQ ID NO: 32) immediately adjacent to the 5'- TTAT-3' insertion site, which is inverted in the orientation in the two ends. That is the left transposon end begins with the sequence 5'- Ί ATCCCGGCGAGCATGAGG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 33), and the right transposon ends with the reverse complement of this sequence: 5'- CCTCATGCTCGCCGGGTTAT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 34). The perfect conservation of this 1 6 bp sequence at both ends of the transposon suggests that it is important for function. One embodiment of the invention is a transposon that comprises a heterologous polynucleotide inserted between SEQ ID NO: 33 and SEQ ID NO: 34. As used herein, a Bombyx mori transposon or a Bombyx transposon means a transposon comprising a heterologous polynucleotide and any of SEQ ID NOS: 32-34 or SEQ ID NOS: 1-4, or sub-sequences of SEQ ID NOS: 1 -4, such that the heterologous polynucleotide can be transposed by a transposase at least 90% identical to SEQ ID NOS: 43 or 44. [00125] The Xenopus transposase recognizes a transposon end with a left sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 5, and a right sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 6. It will excise the transposon from one DNA molecule by cutting the DNA at the 5'-TTAA-3' sequence at the left end of one transposon end to the 5'-TTAA-3' at the right end of the second transposon end, including any heterologous DNA that is placed between them, and insert the excised sequence into a second DNA molecule. Truncated and modified versions of the left and right transposon ends will also function as part of a transposon that can be transposed by the Xenopus tropicalis transposase. For example the left transposon end can be replaced by a sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 7 or SEQ ID NO: 9, the right transposon end can be replaced by a shorter sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 8. In addition, we note that the left and right transposon ends share an 18 bp almost perfectly repeated sequence at their ends (5'- TTAACCYTTTKMCTGCCA: SEQ ID NO: 42) that includes the 5'-TTAA-3' insertion site, which sequence is inverted in the orientation in the two ends. That is in SEQ ID NO: 5 and SEQ ID NO: 9 the left transposon end begins with the sequence 5'- TTAACCTTTTTACTGCCA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 37), or in SEQ ID NO: 7 the left transposon end begins with the sequence 5'- TT A ACC CTTTG CCTGC C A- 3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 38); the right transposon ends with approximately the reverse complement of this sequence: in SEQ ID NO: 6 it ends 5'- TGGC AGT AA A AGGGTTA A■ 3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 40), in SEQ ID NO: 8 it ends 5'- TGGCAGTGAAAGGGTTAA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 41 ) The near- perfect conservation of this 18 bp sequence at both ends of the transposon suggests that it is important for function. One embodiment of the invention is a transposon that comprises a heterologous polynucleotide inserted between two transposon ends each comprising SEQ ID NO: 42 in inverted orientations in the two transposon ends. In some embodiments one transposon end comprises a sequence selected from SEQ ID NOS: 37-39. In some embodiments one transposon end comprises a sequence selected from SEQ ID NOS: 40-41. [00126] Further studies to identify additional variants of transposon ends and transposase sequences with enhanced activity are expressly contemplated. Generation of hyperactive variants is another aspect of this invention wherein mutational studies identify mutations in the transposase, which give rise to hyperactivity (Yusa et.al., PNAS, vol 108, no.4, 1531- 1536, 2011). Once the individual mutants are identified and verified for their transposition activity in cells, these mutations or combinations of mutations can be combined into one sequence to generate a hyperactive transposase that shows higher rates of transposition than the wild-type transposase. Hyperactive variants also include variants with enhanced integration activity, enhanced excision activity or both. Another aspect of this invention includes integration deficient variants, wherein the transposase shows lower integration activity but enhanced excision activity. [00127] Accordingly, the present invention features Bombyx or Xenopus transposons and transposases. Another aspect of this invention refers to a transposon, that comprises a heterologous polynucleotide sequence, as described herein, positioned between at least two ITRs, at least one repeat on either side of the heterologous polynucleotide , wherein these repeats can bind to a transposase protein and wherein the transposon is capable of inserting into DNA of a cell. Accordingly, repeats are preferably sequences that are recognized and bound by the transposase as defined herein. [00128] According to certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, a transposon that is bound by a transposase contains a pair of repeat sequences. In certain preferred embodiments, the first repeat is typically located upstream of the heterologous polynucleotide and the second repeat is typically located downstream of the heterologous polynucleotide. The second repeat represents the same sequence as the first repeat, but shows an inverted orientation compared with the first repeat. That is, considering only one strand of a double- stranded DNA molecule, the second repeat will occur as the reverse complement of the first repeat. In some embodiments these repeats are identical inverted sequences. In some embodiments these inverted repeats may be highly similar but not identical, differing by 1, 2, 3 or 4 nucleotides. These repeats are then termed "inverted repeats" (IRs) or "inverted terminal repeats" (ITRs), due to the fact that each repeat is an inversely repeated copy of the other. In certain embodiments, repeats may occur in a multiple number upstream and downstream of the above mentioned nucleic acid sequence. In certain embodiments, the repeats are short, between 10 - 20 base pairs, and preferably 14-16 base pairs. In some other embodiments, the transposon ends further comprise additional sequences that may or may not be repeats. [00129] In some embodiments, the Xenopus transposon comprises one end comprising at least 14 or 16 or 18 or 20 or 30 or 40 contiguous nucleotides from SEQ ID NO: 5, 7 or 9; in some embodiments, the Xenopus transposon comprises one end comprising at least 14 or 16 or 18 or 20 or 30 or 40 contiguous nucleotides from SEQ ID NO: 6 or 8. In some embodiments, the Xenopus transposon comprises one end with at least 90% identity to SEQ ID NO: 5 or 7 or 9; in some embodiments, the Xenopus transposon comprises one end with at least 90% identity to SEQ ID NO: 6 or 8. In some embodiments of the Xenopus transposon, each inverted terminal repeat (ITR) comprises SEQ ID NO: 42. In some embodiments of the Xenopus transposon, one ITR comprises a sequence selected from SEQ ID NOS: 37-39. In some embodiments of the Xenopus transposon, one ITR comprises a sequence selected from SEQ ID NOS: 40-41. [00130] In some embodiments, the Bombyx transposon comprises one end comprising at least 14 or 16 or 18 or 20 or 30 or 40 contiguous nucleotides from SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3; in some embodiments, the Bombyx transposon comprises one end comprising at least 14 or 16 or 18 or 20 or 30 or 40 contiguous nucleotides from SEQ ID NO: 2 or 4. In some embodiments, the Bombyx transposon comprises one end with at least 90% identity to SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3; in some embodiments, the Bombyx transposon comprises one end with at least 90% identity to SEQ ID NO: 2 or 4. [00131] In some embodiments, the Bombyx transposon comprises one end comprising at least 16 contiguous nucleotides from SEQ ID NO: 33 and one end comprising at least 16 contiguous nucleotides from SEQ ID NO: 34. In some embodiments, each ITR of the Bombyx transposon comprises SEQ ID NO: 32. In these embodiments, SEQ ID NO: 32 is immediately adjacent to the sequence 5'-TTAT-3' or 5'-TTAA-3'. [00132] The ITRs as described herein preferably flank a nucleic acid sequence which is inserted into the DNA of a cell. The nucleic acid sequence can include all or part of an open reading frame of a gene (i.e., that part of a protein encoding gene), one or more expression control sequences (i.e., regulatory regions in nucleic acid) alone or together with all or part of an open reading frame. Preferred expression control sequences include, but are not limited to promoters, enhancers, introns, polyadenylation sequences, border control elements, locus- control regions; expression enhancers that enhance RNA export from the nucleus, including woodchuck hepatitis post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE), hepatitis B virus post- transcriptional regulatory element (HPRE) (for example but not limited to SEQ ID NO: 104- 105) and arctic ground squirrel post-transcriptional regulatory element (AGS) (for example but not limited to SEQ ID NOS: 106-107); and elements whose mechanism of action may not be known, such as scaffold attachment region (SAR) sequences (for example but not limited to SEQ ID NOS: 108-111), and insulator sequences that are thought to prevent the spread of condensed chromatin that might otherwise silence expression and prevent interference from a distal enhancer on a promoter, for example HS4 (for example but not limited to SEQ ID NOS: 112-113) (Yusufzai et. al., PNAS, vol. 101 , no. 23, 8620-8624, June 2004). [00133] Cells whose genomes contain a Bombyx mori transposon or a Xenopus tropicalis transposon are an aspect of the invention. [00134] In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid sequence comprises a promoter operably linked to an open reading frame. The open reading frame may comprise a selectable marker that enables selection by a demonstrable phenotype, for example a fluorescent reporter. According to certain preferred embodiment, transposons of the present invention can preferably occur as a linear transposon (extending from the 5' end to the 3' end, by convention) that can be used as a linear fragment or circularized, for example in a plasmid. [00135] Activity of transposases may be increased by fusion of nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the N -terminus, C-terminus, both at the N- and C-termini or internal regions of the transposase protein so long as transposase activity is retained. A nuclear localization signal or sequence (NLS) is an amino acid sequence that 'tags' or facilitates interaction of a protein, either directly or indirectly with nuclear transport proteins for import into the cell nucleus. Nuclear localization signals (NLS) used can include, but are not limited to, consensus NLS sequences, viral NLS sequences, cellular NLS sequences, and combinations thereof. In preferred embodiments, the NLS sequences are operably linked to the transposase. [00136] The transposase protein can be introduced into a cell as a protein or as a nucleic acid encoding the transposase, for example as a ribonucleic acid, including mRNA, as DNA, e.g. as extrachromosomal DNA including, but not limited to, episomal DNA, as plasmid DNA, or as viral nucleic acid. Furthermore, the nucleic acid encoding the transposase protein can be transfected into a cell as a nucleic acid vector such as a plasmid, or as a gene expression vector, including a viral vector. The nucleic acid can be circular or linear. A vector, as used herein, refers to a plasmid, a viral vector or a cosmid that can incorporate nucleic acid encoding the transposase protein or the transposon of this invention. DNA encoding the transposase protein can be stably inserted into the genome of the cell or into a vector for constitutive or inducible expression. Where the transposase protein is transfected into the cell or inserted into the vector as nucleic acid, the transposase encoding sequence is preferably operably linked to a heterologous promoter. There are a variety of promoters that could be used including, but not limited to, constitutive promoters, tissue-specific promoters, inducible promoters, and the like. All DNA or RNA sequences encoding the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposase proteins are expressly contemplated. 5.2.4 GENE TRANSFER SYSTEM [00137] The present invention also features a gene transfer system comprising a Bombyx mori transposase and a transposon comprising a heterologous polynucleotide between a left ITR and a right ITR that are recognized and transposed by the transposase. The present invention also features a gene transfer system comprising a Xenopus tropicalis transposase and a transposon comprising a heterologous polynucleotide between a left ITR and a right ITR that are recognized and transposed by the transposase. The transposase can be encoded on the same polynucleotide as the transposon in the gene transfer system, or it may be encoded on a second polynucleotide. If the transposase is encoded on the same nucleic acid molecule as the transposon, the transposase is preferably in a part of the molecule that is not transposed. The gene transfer system of this invention, therefore, preferably comprises two components: the transposase as described herein and a transposon as described herein. In combination these two components provide active transposon activity and allow the transposon to be relocated. In use, the transposase binds to the transposon ends and promotes insertion of the intervening nucleic acid sequence into DNA of a cell as defined below. [00138] In some embodiments, a gene transfer vector further comprises sequences encoding the transposase fused to certain protein functional domains. Such protein functional domains can include, but are not limited to, one or more DNA binding domains, one or more nuclear localization signals, one or more flexible hinge regions that can facilitate one or more domain fusions, and combinations thereof. Fusions can be made either to the N-terminus, C- terminus, or internal regions of the transposase protein so long as transposase activity is retained. DNA binding domains used can include, but are not limited to, a helix-turn-helix domain, Zn-finger domain, a leucine zipper domain, or a helix-loop-helix domain. Specific DNA binding domains used can include, but are not limited to, a Gal4 DNA binding domain, a LexA DNA binding domain, or a Zif268 DNA binding domain. Nuclear localization signals (NLS) used can include, but are not limited to, consensus NLS sequences, viral NLS sequences, cellular NLS sequences, and combinations thereof. Flexible hinge regions used can include, but are not limited to, glycine/serine linkers and variants thereof. [00139] In further exemplary embodiments, the gene transfer system comprises a Bombyx mori transposon as defined above in combination with a Bombyx mori transposase protein (or nucleic acid encoding the Bombyx mori transposase protein to provide its activity in a cell). In other embodiments, the gene transfer system comprises a Xenopus tropicalis transposon as defined above in combination with a Xenopus tropicalis transposase protein (or nucleic acid encoding the Xenopus tropicalis transposase protein to provide its activity in a cell). This combination preferably results in the insertion of the nucleic acid sequence into the DNA of the cell. Alternatively, it is possible to insert the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposon into DNA of a cell through non-homologous recombination through a variety of reproducible mechanisms, and even without the activity of a transposase. In either event the described transposon can be used for gene transfer by using this gene transfer system. [00140] In certain embodiments, a gene transfer vector further comprises a recombination protein, for example a recombinase, an integrase or a transposase including a Bombyx mori transposase or Xenopus tropicalis transposase and two or more site specific integration recognition sites to facilitate integration of an expression cassette into the genome of an expression host. In certain embodiments, these integration-facilitating sequences include a 5'-TTAA-3'-target sequence specific insertion element. In some other embodiments, the integration-facilitating sequences include a 5'-TTAT-3'-target sequence specific insertion element. In certain embodiments the integration-facilitating sequences are recognized by an integrase or a transposase, in certain embodiments the integrase is a Bombyx mori integrase, in other embodiments the integrase is a Xenopus tropicalis integrase. In certain embodiments the gene transfer vector further comprises a gene encoding the integrase. In certain embodiments, an expression vector further comprises Lentiviral LTR (long terminal repeats) or inverted repeats (IR) to facilitate integration of an expression cassette into the genome of an expression host. [00141] In some embodiments, a gene transfer vector has restriction endonuclease sites in the expression cassette between the promoter and terminator sequence that facilitate cloning of heterologous polynucleotides for insertion. In preferred embodiments, these restriction endonuclease sites are type lis restriction sites. Typells restriction endonucleases recognize asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave both DNA strands at fixed positions, typically several base pairs away from the recognition sites. This property makes typells restriction endonucleases particularly useful for assembling DNA fragments, where fragments with matching type Ils-generated ends are annealed and ligated, leaving an assembled DNA product without restriction recognition sequence scars at the ligation junctions. Type lis restriction endonucleases that recognize non-palindromic sequences of 5, 6 or 7 base pairs, are found at an average frequency of one in 512, 2048 or 8192 base pairs respectively. It is therefore, relatively easy to identify typells restriction endonucleases that do not cut inside a typical gene-sized DNA fragment or a gRNA fragment. [00142] A gene transfer vector can be constructed to permit cloning using typells restriction endonucleases and ligase by incorporating a stuffer, comprising a counter-selectable marker and flanked by typells restriction sites, into a vector comprising a selectable marker. It is advantageous if the typells restriction sites are chosen such that cleavage of the gene transfer vector with one or more typells restriction enzymes yields a linear nucleic acid fragment comprising a selectable marker and with ends that are not compatible with each other. This design allows directional insertion of an insert DNA fragment that has cohesive ends compatible with the linear nucleic acid fragment of the gene transfer vector. The insert DNA fragment may be prepared by annealing a pair of oligonucleotides, or more preferably by PCR amplification and restriction digestion. In preferred embodiments the gene transfer vector ends are also not pseudo-compatible with each other; that is they do not anneal with each other by forming at least one non-standard Watson-Crick base pair (i.e., T or U with G) in a way that can be joined by a DNA ligase with reasonable efficiency. [00143] In certain preferred embodiments, the gene transfer system mediates insertion of the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposon into the DNA of a variety of cell types and a variety of species by using the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposase protein. Preferably, such cells include any cell suitable in the present context, including but not limited to animal cells or cells from bacteria, fungi (example, yeast and more) or plants. Preferred animal cells can be vertebrate or invertebrate. For example, preferred vertebrate cells include cells from mammals including, but not limited to, rodents, such as rats or mice, ungulates, such as cows or goats, sheep, swine or cells from a human. Target cells also include without being limited thereto, lymphocytes, hepatocytes, neural cells, muscle cells, a variety of blood cells, and a variety of cells of an organism, embryonic stem cells, somatic stem cells e.g. hematopoietic cells, embryos, zygotes, sperm cells (some of which are open to be manipulated by an in vitro setting). [00144] In other further exemplary embodiments, such cells, particularly cells derived from a mammal as defined above, can be pluripotent (i.e., a cell whose descendants can differentiate into several restricted cell types, such as hematopoietic stem cells or other stem cells) and totipotent cells (i.e., a cell whose descendants can become any cell type in an organism, e.g., embryonic stem cells). These cells are advantageously used to affirm stable expression of the transposase or to obtain a multiple number of cells already transfected with the components of the gene transfer system. Additionally, cells such as oocytes, eggs, and one or more cells of an embryo may also be considered as targets for stable transfection with the present gene transfer system. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the cells are Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells or Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. [00145] In other certain exemplary embodiments, the cell DNA that acts as a recipient of the transposon described herein includes any DNA present in a cell (as mentioned above) to be transfected, if the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposon is in contact with a Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposase protein within the cell. For example, the DNA can be part of the cell genome or it can be extrachromosomal, such as an episome, a plasmid, a circular or linear DNA fragment. Typical targets for insertion are for example, double- stranded DNA. [00146] The components of the gene transfer system described herein, that is the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposase protein (either as a protein or encoded by a nucleic acid as described herein) and the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposon can be transfected into a cell, preferably into a cell as defined above, and more preferably into the same cell. Transfection of these components may furthermore occur in subsequent order or in parallel. For example, the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposase protein or its encoding nucleic acid may be transfected into a cell as defined above prior to, simultaneously with or subsequent to transfection of the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposon. Alternatively, the transposon may be transfected into a cell as defined above prior to, simultaneously with or subsequent to transfection of the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposase protein or its encoding nucleic acid. If transfected in parallel, preferably both components are provided in a separated formulation and/or mixed with each other directly prior to administration to avoid transposition prior to transfection. Additionally, administration of at least one component of the gene transfer system may occur repeatedly, for example, by administering at least one, two or multiple doses of this component. [00147] For any of the above transfection reactions, the gene transfer system may be formulated in a suitable manner as known in the art, or as a pharmaceutical composition or kit as described herein. In further preferred embodiments, the components of the gene transfer system may preferably be transfected into one or more cells by techniques such as particle bombardment, electroporation, microinjection, combining the components with lipid- containing vesicles, such as cationic lipid vesicles, DNA condensing reagents (example, calcium phosphate, poly lysine or polyethyleneimine), and inserting the components (that is the nucleic acids thereof into a viral vector and contacting the viral vector with the cell. Where a viral vector is used, the viral vector can include any of a variety of viral vectors known in the art including viral vectors selected from the group consisting of a retroviral vector, an adenovirus vector or an adeno- associated viral vector. [00148] In another embodiment, the nucleic acid encoding the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposase protein may be RNA or DNA. Similarly, either the nucleic acid encoding the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposase protein or the transposon of this invention can be transfected into the cell as a linear fragment or as a circularized fragment, preferably as a plasmid or as recombinant viral DNA. [00149] In another embodiment, the nucleic acid encoding the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposase protein is thereby preferably stably or transiently inserted into the genome of the cell to facilitate temporary or prolonged expression of the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposase protein in the cell. 5.2.5 INCREASING EXPRESSION BY SELECTION [00150] Sequences that are integrated at regions of the genome that are highly transcriptionally active may result in high levels of expression of encoded genes. In addition, or alternatively, sequences that are integrated into the genome in multiple copies may result in high levels of expression of encoded genes. [00151] Methods are known in the art to increase the expression of a first polypeptide encoded by a construct (the expression polypeptide) by attempting to link the expression of the first polypeptide to the expression of a second quantitatively selectable polypeptide. For example, Glutamine synthase (GS) is used as a selectable marker that allows selection via glutamine metabolism. Glutamine synthase is the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia, and is a crucial component of the only pathway for glutamine formation in a mammalian cell. In the absence of glutamine in the growth medium, the GS enzyme is essential for the survival of mammalian cells in culture. Some cell lines, for example mouse myeloma cells do not express sufficient GS to survive without added glutamine. In these cells a transfected GS can function as a selectable marker by permitting growth in a glutamine-free medium. In other cell lines, for example Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells express sufficient GS to survive without exogenously added glutamine. These cell lines can be manipulated by genome editing techniques including CRISPR/Cas9 to reduce or eliminate the activity of the GS enzyme. In all of these cases, GS inhibitors such as methionine sulphoximine (MSX) can be used to inhibit a cell's endogenous GS activity. Selection protocols known in the art include introducing a construct comprising sequences encoding a first polypeptide and a glutamine synthase selectable marker, and then treating the cell with inhibitors of glutamine synthase such as methionine sulphoximine. The higher the levels of methionine sulphoximine that are used, the higher the level of glutamine synthase expression is required to allow the cell to synthesize sufficient glutamine to survive. Some of these cells will also show an increased expression of the first polypeptide. [00152] A second system for increasing expression by selection uses the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) which is required for catalyzing the reduction of 5,6- dihydrofolate (DHF) to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (THF) and is used as a selectable marker. DHFR confers resistance to methotrexate (MTX). DHFR can be inhibited by higher levels of methotrexate. Selection protocols known in the art include introducing a construct comprising sequences encoding a first polypeptide and a DHFR selectable marker into a cell, and then treating the cell with inhibitors of DHFR such as methotrexate. The higher the levels of methotrexate that are used, the higher the level of DHFR expression is required to allow the cell to synthesize sufficient DHFR to survive. Some of these cells will also show an increased expression of the first polypeptide. [00153] The use of transposons and transposases in conjunction with such quantitatively selectable markers has several advantages over non-transposon constructs. One is that linkage between expression of the first polypeptide and the quantitatively selectable marker is better for transposons, because a transposase will integrate the entire sequence that lies between the two transposon ends into the genome. In contrast when heterologous DNA is introduced into the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell, for example a mammalian cell, it is gradually broken into random fragments which may either be integrated into the cell's genome, or degraded. Thus if a construct comprising sequences that encode a first polypeptide and a quantitatively selectable marker is introduced into a population of cells, some cells will integrate the sequences encoding the quantitatively selectable marker but not those encoding the first polypeptide, and vice versa. Selection of cells expressing high levels of selectable marker is thus only somewhat correlated with cells that also express high levels of the first polypeptide. In contrast, because the transposase integrates all of the sequences between the transposon ends, cells expressing high levels of selectable marker are highly likely to also express high levels of the first polypeptide. [00154] A second advantage of transposons and transposases is that they are much more efficient at integrating DNA sequences into the genome. Thus a much higher fraction of the cell population is likely to receive one or more copies of the construct in their genomes, so there will be a correspondingly higher likelihood of good stable expression of both the selectable marker and the first polypeptide. [00155] One embodiment of the present invention is thus a transposon such as described above, that further comprises a sequence encoding a first polypeptide and a selectable marker that can be inhibited by a small molecule inhibitor. In one embodiment the first polypeptide is part of an antibody. Other aspects of the invention include methods for introducing the transposon into the genome of a cell using a transposase, and selecting for high levels of expression of the quantitatively selectable marker. In some embodiments the selectable marker is glutamine synthase, in some embodiments the selectable marker is DHFR. [00156] DNA transposases use a cut-and-paste mechanism for inserting their transposon into a DNA molecule. The number of copies of a transposon that can be integrated into the genome by a transposase is thus limited by the number of copies of the transposon that are present in the cell. The number of nuclear non-integrated copies of a plasmid in a eukaryotic cell can be increased if it contains viral replication sequences. For example in mammalian cells including CHO cells and HEK cells the SV40 origin of replication causes increases in the number of copies of a plasmid especially in the presence of the SV40 large T antigen. Similarly the Epstein-Barr virus origin of replication (OriP) causes increases in the number of copies of a plasmid especially in the presence of the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA) and its truncated derivatives. Plasmids comprising a transposon in addition to viral replication sequences such as the SV40 origin of replication or the Epstein-Barr virus OriP which are not contained within the transposable portion of the transposon will therefore accumulate within the nucleus, providing more substrate copies of the transposon to be integrated into the cell genome. Such plasmids are an aspect of the current invention. The use of such plasmids to increase the number of copies of a transposon that is integrated into a target cell genome is also an aspect of the current invention. These plasmids may further comprise sequences encoding the SV40 large T antigen or the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA). [00157] Plasmids comprising viral replication sequences and transposons may be introduced into cells together with the transposase, or they may be introduced sequentially. Higher numbers of integrated transposons may be selected using quantitatively selectable markers such as DHFR or glutamine synthase. 5.2.6 GENE TRANSFER VECTOR COMPONENTS [00158] The function of sequence elements is dependent upon the context relative to the other sequences within the DNA sequence. An embodiment of the present invention provides a method for constructing a gene transfer vector variant set to improve an expression property of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide. In some embodiments the expression property is an amount of the polypeptide expressed, in some embodiments the expression property is an amount of soluble polypeptide expressed, in some embodiments the expression property is an amount of active polypeptide expressed. In the method, a plurality of sequence elements are identified in a gene transfer vector. The plurality of elements are classified by functional grouping, for example the elements are classified as enhancers, promoters, introns, 5' untranslated regions, 3' untranslated regions, RNA export promoting elements, elements that modulate chromatin structure, polyadenylation signals or transcriptional terminators. In addition, if the gene transfer vector will express more than one gene, the elements are further grouped according to the gene to which they are operably linked. A first gene transfer vector variant set comprising a plurality of configurations of the gene transfer vector is selected, such that members of the gene transfer vector set are related to one another by the substitution of one or more sequence elements, with a different element from the same functional group, or by the complete removal of an element of that functional group. For example a second member of the polynucleotide vector set may have the same configuration as a first member, but with a first enhancer element replaced by a second enhancer element, or a second member of the polynucleotide vector set may have the same configuration as a first member, but lack an enhancer element. A functional group in which there is more than one possible element in the gene transfer vector variant set is referred to as a variant group. [00159] The number of variant groups and the number of elements that can be tested at each of those group positions is then calculated, such that each element will be present in a statistically representative fraction of the first gene transfer vector variant set. Additionally, when using search methods like Tabu, Ant optimization or similar techniques, the space can be searched on a sequence by sequence basis by using a memory of the space that has been visited previously and the properties encountered. [00160] In some embodiments, selection of the variant set comprises applying complete factorial design, a 2k factorial design, a 2k fractional factorial design, a latin squares approach, a greco-latin squares approach, a Plackett-Burmann design, a Taguchi design, a monte carlo algorithm, a genetic algorithm, combinations thereof or some other statistical method for Design of Experiment, to the distribution of elements in the gene transfer vector variant set. [00161] A first expression set, comprising a first expression polynucleotide in all or a portion of the first gene transfer vector variant set, is constructed. An expression property of the first expression set is measured. In some embodiments the expression polynucleotide encodes a first polypeptide, and the expression property is an amount of the polypeptide expressed, or an amount of soluble polypeptide expressed, or an amount of active polypeptide expressed. In some embodiments the first expression polynucleotide is the same sequence in all of the sequences of the first expression set. [00162] In some embodiments of the invention the expression property is measured in one of the following expression systems: bacterial expression systems including Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Bacillus species, Streptomyces species, Pseudomonas species, Ralstonia eutropha, Chlamydomonas species; yeast expression systems including Saccharomyces, Pichia, Klebsiella and Candida species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, Pichia methanolica, Klebsiella lactis; fungal expression systems including Cryptosporidium and Trichoderma species, filamentous fungal protein production systems, protozoan expression systems including Plasmodium falciparum (the causative agent of malaria), Leishmania model organisms including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus laevis; plants including soybean, bushbean, maize, cotton, tobacco, Arabidopsis, tissue culture expression systems including COS cells, Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and fibroblasts including 3T3 cells, cell lines infected with adenovirus, insect cell lines such as those derived from Spodptera species for growing baculovirus; model organisms for the study of disease and tests of the efficacies of DNA vaccines such as macaques, mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, goats and rabbits; in vitro expression systems prepared from extracts of living cells including E coli extracts, wheat germ extracts, rabbit reticulocyte lysates; in vitro expression systems prepared by assembly of purified individual components. [00163] Standard techniques may be utilized to measure the expression property value for each respective polynucleotide in the plurality of polynucleotides of the first expression set. For example, standard techniques can be employed using, e.g. , immunoassays such as, for example Western blot, immunoprecipitation followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, (SDS-PAGE), immunocytochemistry, and the like to determine an expression property value of a respective polynucleotide (e.g. , an amount of a protein encoded by the respective polynucleotide) in the plurality of polynucleotides present in an expression system. Other methods for detection of specific polypeptides include mass spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy of protein samples that have been treated with one or more site specific proteases to produce polypeptide fragments which can be uniquely identified by mass spectroscopy. One exemplary agent for detecting a protein of interest is an antibody capable of specifically binding to a protein of interest, preferably an antibody detectably labeled, either directly or indirectly. [00164] One of the ways in which an antibody specific for a protein of interest can be detectably labeled is by linking the same to an enzyme and use in an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Voller, 1978, "The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)", Diagnostic Horizons 2: 1-7, Microbiological Associates Quarterly Publication, Walkersville, MD; Voller et al., 1978, J. Clin. Pathol. 31 :507-520; Butler, J.E., 1981, Meth. Enzymol. 73:482-523; Maggio (ed.), 1980, Enzyme Immunoassay, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL; Ishikawa et al., (eds.), 1981, Enzyme Immunoassay, Kgaku Shoin, Tokyo, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). The enzyme which is bound to the antibody will react with an appropriate substrate, preferably a chromogenic substrate, in such a manner as to produce a chemical moiety which can be detected, for example, by spectrophotometric, fluorimetric or by visual means. Enzymes which can be used to detectably label the antibody include, but are not limited to, malate dehydrogenase, staphylococcal nuclease, delta-5- steroid isomerase, yeast alcohol dehydrogenase, alpha-glycerophosphate, dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, asparaginase, glucose oxidase, beta-galactosidase, ribonuclease, urease, catalase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucoamylase and acetylcholinesterase. The detection can be accomplished by colorimetric methods which employ a chromogenic substrate for the enzyme. Detection can also be accomplished by visual comparison of the extent of enzymatic reaction of a substrate in comparison with similarly prepared standards. [00165] The method of systematic variation of vector elements and analysis of expression is conceptually quite different from previous methods described in the art, and is an aspect of the present invention. These previous methods have used very small numbers of different vector configurations and anecdotal correlations between vectors and expression properties to derive rules for optimal vector design. Such data are very unlikely to provide a basis from which to accurately model the effects of element choices within the vector upon expression. This is because there has been no systematic variation of vector elements, and because elements frequently interact, so that without systematic design in which co- variation of elements is minimized, it is impossible to attribute an effect to a particular element. In contrast the method of the present invention can be performed without assumptions regarding the element preferences of the expression host, or the underlying mechanism of such preference. Instead, the expression system is interrogated with systematically varied sets of sequences and measurements of the expression properties to determine the element configurations that result in desired expression properties. This method may be applied to any expression system as well as to identify an optimal configuration for high expression in multiple systems if a gene transfer vector is to be used in different systems. [00166] An expression property of each of the polynucleotides in the plurality of polynucleotides of the first expression set can be compared to the element configuration in each of the polynucleotides to ascertain a relationship between element configuration and the expression property. Such correlation can also be achieved using pattern classification methods or statistical methods. Examples of pattern classification methods or statistical methods include, but are not limited to linear regression, non-linear regression, logistic regression, multivariate data analysis, classification using a regression tree, partial least squares projection to latent variables, computation of a neural network, computation of a Bayesian model, computation of a generalized additive model, use of a support vector machine, , or modeling comprising boosting or adaptive boosting. See, for example, Duda et al , 2001, Pattern Classification, Second Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York; Hastie, 2003, The Elements of Statistical Learning, Springer, New York; and Agresti 1996, An Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis, John Wiley & Sons, New York, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein for such purpose. Such modeling or correlation can then be used to assign values for the different elements in the expression system. The design and synthesis of a gene transfer vector variant set and measurement of an expression property of the polynucleotides within a gene transfer vector variant set for the purpose of evaluating different vector element choices within an expression system is an aspect of the present invention. [00167] In some embodiments, the method further comprises the steps of (i) modeling a sequence-activity relationship between (a) one or more substitutions at one or more elements in the gene transfer vector variant set and (b) the expression property measured for all or the portion of the variants in the variant set, and (ii) defining a second gene transfer variant set to comprise variants that include substitutions in the plurality of elements that are selected based on a function of the sequence- activity relationship. In some embodiments the modeling a sequence-activity relationship comprises modeling a plurality of sequence-activity relationships each of which uses only a subset of the available sequence and activity data. [00168] Several methods exist for regression of multivariate data, where predictive relationships between some or all of the independent variables and expression level are determined. Examples of such methods are Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Principal Components Regression (PCR) (Wold et ah , 1993, "DNA and peptide sequences and chemical processes multivariately modeled by principal component analysis and partial least- squares projections to latent structures," Analytica Chimica Acta 277, 239-253). PLS algorithms, for example, seek to maximize the correlation of the X-data {e.g., codon frequencies) and expression while simultaneously maximizing the X-data variance captured in the model. In doing so, the algorithm determines new orthogonal variables, called latent variables, which are linear combinations of the original variables that best capture the X-data and explain Y variation. [00169] In some embodiments, the sequence-expression relationship has the form: Y = f(WiXi , W2X2) . . .WjXi) where, Y is a quantitative measure of the expression property; Xi is a descriptor of a substitution, a combination of substitutions, or a component of one or more substitutions, at one or more positions in the plurality of positions; Wj is a weight applied to descriptor x;; and f( ) is a mathematical function. [00170] In some embodiments, the modeling comprises regressing: Y = f(WiXi , W2X2) . . .WjXi). [00171] In some instances this regressing comprises linear regression, non-linear regression, logistic regressing, or partial least squares projection to latent variables. [00172] A sequence-expression relationship derived from the expression properties of a first expression variant set may be used to design gene transfer vectors to express a second polypeptide with a different amino acid sequence. The use of a sequence-expression relationship to design vectors for the expression of a polypeptide of interest, where the sequence-expression relationship was derived from polynucleotides encoding polypeptides that are not the polypeptide of interest is an aspect of the invention. [00173] In some embodiments, modeling techniques are used to derive sequence-expression relationships. Such modeling techniques include linear and non-linear approaches. Linear and non- linear approaches are differentiated from each other based on the algebraic relationships used between variables and responses in such approaches. In the system being modeled, the input data (e.g. , variables that serve as descriptors of the biopolymer sequence), in turn, can be linearly related to the variables provided or non- linear combinations of the variables. It is therefore possible to perform different combinations of models and datatypes: linear input variables can be incorporated into a linear model, non-linear input variables can be incorporated into a linear model and non- linear variables can be incorporated into non- linear models. [00174] In some embodiments, supervised learning techniques are used to identify relationships between vector element configurations in the expression set and measured expression properties. Such supervised learning techniques include, but are not limited to, Bayesian modeling, nonparametric techniques (e.g. , Parzen windows, £„-Nearest-Neighbor algorithms, and fuzzy classification), neural networks (e.g. , hopfield network, multilayer neural networks and support vector machines), and machine learning algorithms (e.g. , algorithm-independent machine learning). See, for example, Duda et al. , Pattern Classification, 2nd edition, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. New York; and Pearl, Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems: Networks of Plausible Inference, Revised Second Printing, 1988, Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco. For example, the sequence - expression data can be used to predict the expression property of any sequence given the codon descriptors for a sequence using a neural network. The input for the network is the descriptors and the output is the predicted value of Y. The weights and the activation function can be trained using supervised decision based learning rules. The learning is performed on a subset of variants called the training set and performance of the network is evaluated on a test set. [00175] In some embodiments, unsupervised learning techniques are used to identify relationships between vector element configurations in the expression set and measured expression properties. Such unsupervised learning techniques include, but are not limited to stochastic searches (e.g. , simulated annealing, Boltzmann learning, evolutionary methods, principal component analysis, and clustering methods). See, for example, Duda et al. , Pattern Classification, 2nd edition, 2001, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. New York. For example, the weights in equation B can be adjusted by using monte carlo and genetic algorithms. The optimization of weights for non-linear functions can be complicated and no simple analytical method can provide a good solution in closed form. Genetic algorithms have been successfully used in search spaces of such magnitude. Genetic algorithms and genetic programming techniques can also be used to optimize the function form to best fit the data. For instance, many recombinations of functional forms applied on descriptors of the sequence variants can be applied. [00176] In some embodiments, boosting techniques are used to construct and/or improve models developed using any of the other techniques described herein. A model of the sequence-expression relationship can be described as a functional form whose parameters have been trained for the input data (Y and x;). Many algorithms / techniques to build models have been described. Algorithms applied on a specific dataset can be weak in that the predictions can be less accurate or "weak" (yielding poor models). Models can be improved using boosting techniques. See, for example, Hastie et al., The Elements of Statistical Learning, 2001 , Springer, New York. The purpose of boosting is to combine the outputs of many "weak" predictors into a powerful "committee." In one embodiment of the invention, boosting is applied using the AdaBoost algorithm. Here, the prediction algorithm is sequentially applied to repeatedly modified versions of the data thereby producing a sequence of models. The predictions from all of these models are combined through a weighted majority vote to produce the final prediction. The data modification at each step consists of applying weights (Wb to each of the i training observations. Initially weights are set to 1/N, where N is the number of training observation (sequence-activity data). The weights are modified individually in each successive iteration. Training observations that were predicted poorly by a particular model have their weights increased and training observations that were predicted more accurately have their weights decreased. This forces each successive model to concentrate on those training observations that are issued by the previous model. The step of combining the models to produce a "committee" assigns a weight to each model based on the overall prediction error of that model. [00177] The various modeling techniques and algorithms described herein can be adapted to derive relationships between one or more expression properties and the element configuration of a polynucleotide and therefore to make multiple predictions from the same model. Modeling techniques that have been adapted to derive sequence-expression relationships for polynucleotides are within the scope of the present invention. Some of these methods derive linear relationships (for example partial least squares projection to latent structures) and others derive non- linear relationships (for example neural networks). Algorithms that are specialized for mining associations in the data are also useful for designing sequences to be used in the next iteration of sequence space exploration. These modeling techniques can robustly deal with experimental noise in the activity measured for each variant. Often experiments are performed in replicates and for each variant there will be multiple measurement of the same activity. These multiple measurements (replicate values) can be averaged and treated as a single number for every variant while modeling the sequence- expression relationship. The average can be a simple mean or another form of an average such as a geometric or a harmonic mean. In the case of multiple measurements, outliers can be eliminated. In addition, the error estimation for a model derived using any algorithm disclosed herein can incorporate the multiple measurements through calculating the standard deviation of the measurement and comparing the predicted activity from the model with the average and estimate the confidence interval within which the prediction lies. Weights for observations to be used in models can also be derived from the accuracy of measurement, for example, through estimating standard deviation and confidence intervals. This procedure can put less emphasis on variants whose measurements are not accurate. Alternatively, these replicate values can be treated independently. This will result in duplicating the sequences in the dataset. For example, if sequence variant, represented by descriptor values {xj }11, has been measured in triplicates(Yn, Y&, YB), the training set for modeling will include descriptor value {xj }12 with activity Y;2 and {xj }13 with activity Y;3 in addition to {xj }11 with activity Yn> where {xj }n= {xj }i2 = {xj }13. [00178] The models developed using various algorithms and methods in the previous step can be evaluated by cross validation methods. For example, by randomly leaving data out to build a model and making predictions of data not incorporated into the model is a standard technique for cross validation. In some instances, data may be generated over a period of months. The data can be added incrementally to the modeling procedure as and when such data becomes available. This can allow for validation of the model with partial or additional datasets, as well as predictions for the properties of gene transfer vector configurations for which activities are still not available. This information may then be used to validate the model. [00179] In one embodiment of the present invention, average values and standard deviations for weight functions can be obtained by omitting a part of the available data. Either individual sequences and their associated expression activities or individual codons can be left out. A sequence-expression relationship can then be constructed from this partial data. This process can be repeated many times, each time the data to leave out is selected randomly. Finally an average and range of values for each weight function is calculated. The weight functions can then also be ranked in order of their importance to activity. The range of values for each weight can provide a measure of the confidence with which the weight is assigned. It can also provide a measure of the importance of the variable in determining the expression property. For example in some instances, the larger the standard deviation for a variable weight, the larger the range of values for that variable that are associated with desirable expression properties. [00180] In some instances the mean value for the variable weight is used to indicate the likely contribution of the element or combination of elements to vector performance. In some instances the mean value for the variable weight minus the standard deviation of the weight is used to indicate the likely contribution of the element or combination of elements to vector performance. In some instances an element or combination of elements is selected if the mean value of the variable weight is above a predetermined value. In some instances an element or combination of elements is selected if the mean value of the weight minus the standard deviation of the weight is above a predetermined value. In some instances the predetermined value is the mean value of all of the variable weights in the model. In some instances the predetermined value is greater than the value of 95% of the variable weights; in some instances the predetermined value is greater than the value of 90% of the variable weights; in some instances the predetermined value is greater than the value of 80% of the variable weights; in some instances the predetermined value is greater than the value of 50% of the variable weights. [00181] In some instances the modeling comprises partial least squares regression and the weight is a regression vector. The regression vector for each variable is used to identify elements that are most favorable for expression in a system. In some instances an element is selected if its regression vector is the highest in the element set, or if it has one of the top 2 or top 3 or top 4 or top 5 or top 6 or top 7 or top 8 or top 9 or top 10 values for regression vectors. [00182] The initial set of data can be small, so models built from it can be inaccurate. Improving the modeled relationship further depends upon obtaining better values for weights whose confidence scores are low. To obtain this data, additional variants designed will provide additional data useful in establishing more precise sequence-expression relationships. [00183] In some embodiments, defining the second variant set comprises adding one or more variants each having an element not present in any variant in the first variant set. In some embodiments, defining the second variant set comprises adding one or more variants each having an element changed in a group not varied in any variant in the first variant set. [00184] Sequence-activity modeling requires an adequate amount of data from variants with statistically distributed element compositions. In some embodiments the first expression set comprises between 5 and 200 gene transfer vectors which each differ from the other members of the set by at least 1 functional element, in preferred embodiments the first expression set comprises at least 10 gene transfer vectors which each differ from the other members of the set by at least 2 functional elements, in some embodiments the first expression set comprises between 10 and 100 gene transfer vectors which each differ from the other members of the set by at least 2 functional elements, in some embodiments the first expression set comprises between 15 and 60 gene transfer vectors which each differ from the other members of the set by at least 2 functional elements. [00185] Examples of such polynucleotide vector sets are shown in Tables 15-18. For two or more functional groups, the polynucleotide vector set is constructed with a first coding polynucleotide that encodes a first expression polypeptide. In some embodiments the first expression polypeptide is a fluorescent protein, or an antibody chain. An expression property is measured for all or a portion of the variants in the variant set. A sequence- activity relationship is modeled between (i) one or more substitutions at one or more elements of the polynucleotide vector set and (ii) the property measured for all or the portion of the variants in the variant set. The variant set is then redefined to comprise variants that include substitutions in the plurality of elements that are selected based on a function of the sequence- activity relationship. In preferred embodiments the variant set comprises between 5 and 200 vector configurations, in preferred embodiments the variant set comprises between 10 and 100 vector configurations, in preferred embodiments the variant set comprises between 15 and 60 vector configurations. [00186] The properties of a biological system including natural as well as non-natural systems with respect to any measured property depends on the interaction between multiple nucleic acid sequence elements, which may be located at positions throughout the polynucleotide. The ability to rationally design a nucleic acid construct with an optimal configuration of elements is advantageous for various applications such as protein synthesis via vector optimization, cell line development and strain engineering. Protein synthesis is a highly dynamic and multi-step process and which plays a central role in synthetic biology, pharmaceutical production and other applications in biotechnology. This importance has led to the development of various parts or genetic control elements able to modulate and precisely control various aspects of protein expression. This capability is not only essential for the successful construction of more complex synthetic biological devices, but also provides tools needed for the tuning of their function for improved performance and reliability. [00187] Many different types of parts capable of controlling transcriptional and translational aspects of the protein synthesis process have been developed. At the transcriptional level, libraries of promoters have been created spanning a wide range of expression levels (Mey et.al., 2007 BMC Biotechnology; Hartner et.al. , 2008 Nucleic Acids Research) and efforts have been made to understand potential rules governing promoter structure (Blount et.al. , 2012 PLoS One 7; Blazeck et.al. , 2013 Biotecnology Journal; Lubliner et.al. , 2013 Nucleic Acids Research). At the translational level, libraries of ribosome binding sites (RBSs) have been generated (Mutalik et.al. , 2013 Nature Methods) and some rational approaches developed (Salis et.al., 2009 Nature Biotechnology). Biophysical models of interactions between the ribosome and mRNA have successfully been used to predict relative ribosome initiation strengths and applied in a forward-engineering mode to suggest potential RBS sequences with a desired strength (Salis et.al., 2009 Nature Biotechnology). In addition to RBSs, the speed of translation has been found to be strongly influenced by synonymous codon usage within the gene being expressed. Changes in codon usage have been shown to strongly affect overall expression levels (Welch et.al., 2009 PLoS; Kudla et.al., 2009 Science), influence correct folding of active proteins (Zhang et.al., 2009 Nature Structural and Molecular Biology), and to enable dynamic responses to environmental stresses (Wohlgemuth et.al., 2013 Nucleic Acids Research). [00188] Configurations of polynucleotide vectors with improved expression properties are an aspect of the present invention, including the configurations shown in Tables 6-18. [00189] In preferred embodiments, a gene transfer vector comprises expression elements capable of driving high protein expression, for example a mammalian enhancer selected from amongst the CMV immediate early enhancer (see for example, DQ000968.1 01:66276969; KF853603.1 01:576890587), the EFla enhancer (see for example, J04617.1 01: 181962), the adenoviral major late protein enhancer (see for example, JX173086.1 01:406679291), the SV40 enhancer (see for example, KM486843.1 01:731516977; JQ394984.1 01:41058488); a promoter selected from amongst the EFla promoter (see for example, J04617.1 01: 181962; AC097023.6 GL49615137; NM 010106.2 01: 126032328; AY188393.1 01:30313796) from any mammalian or avian species including but not limited to human, rat, mice, chicken and Chinese hamster, the CMV promoter (see for example, DQ000968.1 01:66276969; M64943.1 01:330637), the GAPDH promoter (see for example, J04038.1 01: 182980) from any mammalian species, the Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) promoter (see for example, J04327.1 GI:330219), the actin promoter (see for example, X00182.1 GI:63017) from any mammalian or avian species including but not limited to human, rat, mice, chicken and Chinese hamster, and the ubiquitin promoter (see for example, BC000379.2 GI:33875368); an intron selected from among CMV intron A (see for example, M21295.1 01:330620), CMV intron B (see for example, M21295.1 GI:330620), CMV intron C (see for example, M21295.1 GI:330620), the EFla intron (see for example, J04617.1 GI: 181962) from any mammalian or avian species including but not limited to human, rat, mice, chicken and Chinese hamster, the actin intron (see for example, X00182.1 GI:63017) from any mammalian or avian species including but not limited to human, rat, mice, chicken and Chinese hamster, the GAPDH intron (see for example, J04038.1 GI: 182980 ) from any mammalian or avian species including but not limited to human, rat, mice, chicken and Chinese hamster, the adenoviral major late protein intron (see for example, U89672.1 01:1899166), the PGK promoter (see for example, KC710227.1 GI:501416041) from any mammalian or avian species including but not limited to human, rat, mice, chicken and Chinese hamster; 5' untranslated regions (5' UTRs) from any mammalian or avian species including but not limited to human, rat, mice, chicken and Chinese hamster. [00190] In preferred embodiments the gene transfer vector may comprise selectable markers to enable selection of cells with stably integrated transposons. Examples include genes that confer resistance to puromycin, neomycin, hygromycin, blasticidin and zeocin. The gene transfer vector may comprise a bacterial resistance marker and a bacterial origin of replication to facilitate manipulation in prokaryotic cells. These prokaryotic elements are preferably contained within the non-transposable portion of the vector. [00191] In preferred embodiments gene transfer vector may comprise other sequence elements that enhance expression of the genes that they encode. Examples include elements that are believed to enhance RNA processing and nuclear export such as woodchuck hepatitis post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE), hepatitis B virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (HPRE) (for example but not limited to SEQ ID NO: 104-105) and arctic ground squirrel post-transcriptional regulatory element (AGS) (for example but not limited to SEQ ID NOS: 106-107). Examples also include polyadenylation sequences such as the polyadenylation sequences from BGH (bovine growth hormone) (see for example, M57764.1 GI: 163091; KF992215.1 GE593024220), HGH (human growth hormone) (see for example, M13438.1 GI:183156), the polyadenylation signals from human (see for example, X03145.1 01:34173) or rabbit (see for example, NM_001082260.2 GI:129270172; EF186084.1 GI: 122893039) beta globin, viral polyadenylation signals including those from SV40 (see for example, AY122060.1 GI:22001016) or herpes simplex virus (see for example, M38699.1 GI: 330309) and terminator sequences from gastrin. Examples also include sequences that are thought to act as insulators by preventing the spread of heterochromatin or promoter interference such as but not limited to the HS4 (SEQ ID NOS: 112) and HS4 core (SEQ ID NOS: 113). In some preferred embodiments, a pair of insulators surround the expressible sequences. Examples also include sequences believed to mediate attachment to the chromatin scaffold such as but not limited to SEQ ID NOS: 108-111. Regardless of their actual mechanism, incorporation of expression enhancing elements into gene transfer vectors and transposons is expressly contemplated. In preferred embodiments, gene transfer vectors comprise transposons. [00192] In some embodiments, the nucleic acid construct is a vector with enhanced expression and integration properties. For example, an optimal configuration of vector elements for enhanced transient expression as well as more efficient stable integration and expression was identified by the methods described herein. A mammalian vector construct variant set was generated using multiple combinations of various transposon ends, insulators, enhancers, promoters, 5' untranslated regions (UTRs), 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), RNA export modulating sequence, polyadenylation sequences, terminators, matrix attachment element and transposases. The mammalian vector variant set was tested for optimal DasherGFP expression in Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells to identify an optimized vector construct. Other optimized vector constructs were identified with optimal configurations of elements listed above that show high expression of DasherGFP in HEK 293 and CHO cell lines as shown in Tables 6-20. Vector configurations with different promoter combinations were also shown to affect DasherGFP expression. Further optimization of this vector construct for different cell lines using the methods described herein is expressly contemplated. An advantage of the methods described herein is to quickly identify a subset of sequence elements most likely to influence desired activity as well as to facilitate predictable construction of optimal configuration of elements. [00193] In some embodiments, two promoters are placed in opposite orientation, each driving an expression cassette such that transcription from the two promoters diverges. Such a configuration greatly improves expression of transcripts from the expression cassettes. [00194] In some embodiments, elements that are useful in enhancing performance may include those localized to the genomic DNA of a cell. For example expression may be influenced by the levels of RNA polymerases, chaperonins, proteases, processing enzymes, or other factor encoded by DNA on the cell chromosome. It might also be advantageous to augment the host chromosome with functional elements that influence performance. In some embodiments, a variable for engineering is the site at which a functional gene is integrated into a host cell chromosome. [00195] In some embodiments, the nucleic acid construct is a polynucleotide comprising elements or combinations of elements arranged in an optimal configuration. In some embodiments, the polynucleotide is linear. In some embodiments, the elements in a nucleic acid construct comprise functional genetic features, for example, promoters, enhancers, introns, polyadenylation signals, origins of replication, and terminators. In some embodiments, the elements in a nucleic acid construct comprise protein-encoding elements such as secretion signals, resistance markers, anchoring peptides, localization signals, and fusion tags. In some embodiments, the plurality of elements comprises three or more elements, six or more elements, between three and twenty elements or between three and hundred elements. In some embodiments, nucleic acid construct variants include substitutions in a single element comprising one or more positions, three or more positions, six or more positions. In some embodiments, nucleic acid variants include substitutions wherein the substitutions are variations in elements and/or presence or absence of elements. In some embodiments, the substitutions include changes in the position of one or more elements. In some embodiments, nucleic acid variants include a change in the order of one or more elements. [00196] An important aspect of the present invention is that it enables the assessment of the performance of different types of elements: those that affect transcription, those that affect RNA processing, those that affect RNA export from the nucleus of the cell, those that affect integration into the host genome, those that affect replication within the host cell, those that affect translational initiation and those that affect translational elongation. The present invention allows sets of polynucleotide constructs to be designed to test the interactions of these types of elements. [00197] In some embodiments, the configuration of sequence elements in the transposon will result in highly efficient integration into the genome of the target cell. In these instances addition of the transposase may provide only a small improvement in the expression of genes on the transposon, or no improvement at all. The present invention expressly contemplates that under some circumstances, the configuration of sequence elements within the transposon will be sufficient so that the gene transfer system will not need to include the transposase. 5.2.7 USE OF COUPLING ELEMENTS IN A GENE TRANSFER SYSTEM [00198] Messenger RNA molecules in eukaryotic cells are generally monocistronic, that is, they usually encode a single polypeptide. This is because translation in eukaryotes generally occurs by a process in which the ribosome binds to a structure at the 5' end of the mRNA and then "scans" down the mRNA until it finds an initiation codon (generally AUG) where it begins translation. It then translates the mRNA, producing the encoded polypeptide, until it reaches a termination codon (generally UAA, UAG or UGA) which causes the ribosome to end translation and dissociate from the mRNA. Certain eukaryotic viruses have evolved mechanisms by which they can express more than one polypeptide from a single mRNA. These include internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), and cis-acting hydrolase element (CHYSEL) sequences. [00199] An IRES provides a structure to which the ribosome can bind that does not need to be at the 5' end of the mRNA. It can therefore direct a ribosome to initiate translation at a second initiation codon within an mRNA, allowing more than 1 polypeptide to be produced from a single mRNA. A CHYSEL sequence causes a translating eukaryotic ribosome to release the growing polypeptide chain that it is synthesizing without dissociating from the mRNA. The ribosome continues translating, and therefore produces a second polypeptide. A single genetic construct can contain more than one IRES or CHYSEL sequence, and it can contain both IRES and CHYSEL sequences, so can therefore encode 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or more than 6 polypeptides on a single mRNA. [00200] IRES or CHYSEL sequences can therefore be used as coupling elements, to link the expression of two or more polypeptides. For example the expression of a first polypeptide may be linked to the expression of a selectable protein that provides a physical, chemical or biological method for selecting cells on the basis of how much of the selectable protein is expressed. The use of certain selectable proteins to indicate the status or functionality of a genetic construct within an organism is an aspect of the invention. The combining of selectable proteins with IRES or CHYSEL sites to indicate the status or functionality of a polynucleotide, or to indicate the level of expression of a polynucleotide or polypeptide is another aspect of the invention. IRES sequences are used to simultaneously express two or more proteins from a single promoter. [00201] Another important application of translational coupling sequences, particularly IRES sequences, is in allowing the co-expression of two polypeptide chains that function together, either to catalyze different steps in a metabolic pathway, or as parts of the same molecule. A particularly important example is in the formation of a human antibody; a full human antibody consists of two heavy and two light chains. For antibody production, it is desirable for the heavy and light chains to be expressed in an optimal ratio. Monoclonal antibodies (Mab) are heteroteiramers consisting of an equimolar ratio of heavy chain (HQ to light chain (LQ genes encoded on either one or two plasmids. Although the chains are present at equimolar amounts ratio in the final antibody molecule, higher amounts of antibody are generally expressed if the light chain is more highly expressed than the heavy chain. Further, although the optimal ratio May be as high as 5x as much light chain as heavy chain, the exact ratio that gives most assembled antibody tetramer depends on the exact antibody being expressed. [00202] Optimization of the ratio of heavy and light chain is typically accomplished in one of two ways. In the first, polynucleotides encoding the heavy chain and the light chain are carried on two different plasmids and co-transfected into a host cell. In the second, a single plasmid carries both polynucleotides (encoding the heavy chain and the light chain), each with its own promoter and polyadenylation sequence. In the case of co-transfection, individual cells take up different numbers of each plasmid. Because it is only possible to control the average number of each plasmid taken up by each cell, many cells do not end up expressing the optimal ratio of heavy and light chain. This problem is amplified in the case of stable cell lines, because there is the further variable of integration location which also affects expression levels. Dual promoter constructs overcome these difficulties, and can often be effective. However they can become large and genetically unstable because of repeated sequences: promoters, enhancers, polyadenylation sequences, RNA export sequences such as WPRE and HPRE and matrix attachment regions may ail need to be duplicated. This can compromise transfection efficiency and performance; there can also be interference between two eukaryotic promoters in the same construct. [00203] These drawbacks may be overcome by using IRES sequences, providing a set of IRES sequences are available which can produce different levels of expression of the second polypeptide relative to the first. This allows the equivalent of the titration that is currently accomplished by co-transfecting different amounts of the two plasmids. However it has the significant advantage that each cell gets an equal number of copies of the polynucleotides encoding the first polypeptide and the second polypeptide (because they are on the same plasmid), even though different cells may get different numbers of plasmids. Thus even though the amount of each polypeptide may vary from cell to cell, the ratio of the amount of the first polypeptide to the second polypeptide should be much less variable. [00204] The most commonly used IRES in mammalian systems is that from Encephalomyocarditis virus, which includes four amino acids of the N-terminus of the second open reading frame (MATT). There are thus two significant limitations in the currently available tools for co-expression of multiple genes in eukaryotic cells. Firstly, there is no readily available set of IRES sequences that give a known range of ratios of expression between the first and second open reading frame, so it is difficult to control the relative expression of two proteins. Secondly, the most commonly used IRES sequence requires an N-terminal extension of the second protein, which may compromise or modify the function of that protein. There is thus a need in the art for a set of characterized sequences that can be easily incorporated between a first and a second open reading frame to create an optimal expression balance for a downstream function or product of the cell. [00205] We synthesized sequences inspired by the 5' untranslated regions of positive strand RNA viruses, cloned them under control of a single promoter into a vector between a polynucleotide encoding a green fluorescent protein and a polynucleotide encoding a red fluorescent protein, transfected the construct into mammalian ceils and measured the expression of red and green fluorescence. Using this test we identified IRES sequences that function in human embryonic kidney (HEK) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (SEQ ID NOS: 58-100) and that show different expression levels of the second (IRES-controlled) protein relative to the first. This is of particular importance since Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the dominant host for industrial monoclonal antibody production because of their capacity for proper protein folding, assembly and appropriate post-translational modifications. Each of these active sequences can be used to search sequence databases for similar sequences, and similar sequences can in turn be tested using the same system. In preferred embodiments, the IRES sequence is selected from bat picornavirus sequences or rodent picornavirus sequences. Very similar sequences have quite large differences in function. One method to improve the function of individual IRESes is to create consensus sequences. Another method is to identify sequences from viral strains that are reported to be most virulent. Another method is to create libraries of variant sequences and to test members of these libraries using a pair of fluorescent reporter proteins. [00206] In some embodiments, the IRES sequence has at least 80% similarity to SEQ ID NOS: 58-100, or is a chimera of two or more of these sequences. In some other embodiments, the IRES sequence has at least 90% similarity to SEQ ID NOS: 58-100. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid encodes IRES sequences, wherein the nucleic acid has at least at least 80%, at least 90% at least 95%, at least 98% or at least 99% sequence identity to a consensus sequence derived from a set of naturally occurring sequences of the 5' untranslated region of RNA viral genomes; in some embodiments the consensus sequence is not itself identical to any naturally occurring sequence. In some embodiments, an IRES sequence has at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% similarity to 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) of the picomavirus family of viruses. In some embodiments, the IRES elements of the invention are incorporated into an expression vector with a single promoter and one or more IRES elements that allow control of the expression ratios of one or more genes. In other embodiments, IRES elements that function as enhancers are incorporated into an expression vector wherein the IRES elements function to enhance expression of one or multiple genes. [00207] Use of IRES sequences to control expression levels of two or more proteins in a gene transfer vector comprising transposons for stable integration with or without transposases identified herein, with particular emphasis on expressing antibodies in Chinese hamster ovary cells ((310) or Human embryonic kidney (IIEK) cells is another important aspect of this invention. For example, expression of heavy and light chains of an antibody can be controlled by selecting an IRES with the appropriate strength. [00208] Another aspect of the invention is the use of IRES sequences in transient expression vectors. Use of IRES elements to control expression levels of two or more proteins in expression vectors comprising elements or combinations of elements arranged in an optimal configuration as described herein (Section 5.2.6) above is another embodiment of the invention. Additional embodiments include use of IRES sequences to control expression levels of two or more polypeptides in expression vectors (with transposons for stable integration and without for transient expression) with viral replication sequences to increase copy number of the plasmid. Use of IRES sequences in any of the vector configurations shown in any of the Tables here shown is an aspect of the invention. [00209] Ratios of expressed genets) can be controlled using the various IRES elements identified. This is particularly useful when the gene products are to be expressed in a fixed ratio to get optimal results. [00210] In some preferred embodiments, IRES sequences are selected from SEQ ID NOS: 58-100. [00211] in some embodiments, it is advantageous to include secretory peptides at the amino- terminus of a protein that enables translocation of the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This helps not only in the ease of purification but also allows proper folding of complex disulfide bonds and glycosyiation. Proper selection of a signal peptide can have dramatic consequences on protein over- expression. A number of efficient secretion peptides have been described, for example interleukin-2, CDS, the immunoglobulin kappa light chain, tripsinogen, serum albumin and prolactin. We have identified secretion peptides (SEQ ID NOS: 1 14-1 15) that function well in combination with IRES sequences. This is especially important for expression of antibodies in a single construct using IRES elements as described herein. [00212] A kit comprising a single expression vector with one or more IRES elements and reagents to facilitate cloning of ORFs into the vector is another aspect of the invention. The kit can additionally include a set of IRES elements as templates, such that the IRES elements can be incorporated into an expression vector of choice. 5.2.8 ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS OF THE GENE TRANSFER SYSTEM [00213] Using the gene transfer system for methods such as gene discovery and/or gene tagging, permits, for example, identification, isolation, and characterization of genes involved with growth and development through the use of transposons as insertional mutagens or identification, isolation and characterization of transcriptional regulatory sequences controlling growth and development. [00214] The gene transfer system of the invention represents a considerable refinement of non- viral DNA-mediated gene transfer. For example, adapting viruses as agents for gene therapy restricts genetic design to the constraints of that virus genome in terms of size, structure and regulation of expression. Non- viral vectors, as described herein, are generated largely from synthetic starting materials and are therefore more easily manufactured than viral vectors. Non- viral reagents are less likely to be immunogenic than viral agents making repeat administration possible. Non-viral vectors are more stable than viral vectors and therefore better suited for pharmaceutical formulation and application than are viral vectors. Additionally, the gene transfer system of the present invention is a non- viral gene transfer system that facilitates insertion into DNA and markedly improves the frequency of stable gene transfer. [00215] An efficient method for using transposon-transposase combinations of the present invention to stably introduce a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to redirect the specificity of human T-cells is expressly contemplated and is an important aspect of the invention. For example, redirecting the specificity of T cells for B-lineage antigens and advanced B-cell malignancies by infusion of such tumor- specific T cells (adoptive cell transfer) modified by the transposon-transposase of the present invention is another embodiment. Combining cell- based therapies with gene-based therapies, in which genetically engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or tumor-specific T-cell receptor genes are expressed in immune effector cells has enormous therapeutic potential. CARs combine intracellular signaling domains with a single-chain variable fragment of an antibody (Ab) into a single chimeric protein. Engineering immune cells (T-cells) to recognize and attack their tumors is a powerful approach especially in treating B-cell malignancies or lymphomas. A chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) recognizes cell-surface tumor-associated antigen independent of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and employs one or more signaling molecules to activate genetically modified T cells for killing, proliferation, and cytokine production. For example, targeting CD 19 has been achieved through the enforced expression of a CAR that recognizes CD 19 independent of HLA. In contrast to methods that genetically modify T cells using recombinant retrovirus, a non-viral gene transfer approach using the transposon-transposase system to enforce expression of the introduced CAR is a viable alternative and avoids some of the issues such as preferential integration sites associated with most viruses. To improve therapeutic potential, CAR signaling through CD28 and CD3- ζ to sustain T-cell proliferation and recycle effector functions in vivo is also contemplated. [00216] The present invention further provides an efficient method for producing transgenic animals, including the step of applying the gene transfer system of the present invention to an animal. Transgenic DNA has not been efficiently inserted into chromosomes. Only about one in a million of the foreign DNA molecules are inserted into the cellular genome, generally several cleavage cycles into development. Consequently, most transgenic animals are mosaic (Hackett et al. 'The molecular biology of transgenic fish'; Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Fishes ((Hochachka & Mommsen, eds.) Vol. 2, pp. 207-240, 1993). As a result, animals raised from embryos into which transgenic DNA has been delivered must be cultured until gametes can be assayed for the presence of inserted foreign DNA. Many transgenic animals fail to express the transgene due to position effects. A simple, reliable procedure that directs early insertion of exogenous DNA into the chromosomes of animals at the one-cell stage is needed. The present system helps to fill this need. [002 J 7] In certain preferred embodiments, the gene transfer system of this invention can readily be used to produce transgenic animals that carry a particular marker or express a particular protein in one or more cells of the animal. Generally, methods for producing transgenic animals are known in the art and incorporation of the gene transfer system of the present invention into these techniques does not require undue experimentation, e.g. there are a variety of methods for producing transgenic animals for research or for protein production including, but not limited to Hackett et al. (1993, supra). Other methods for producing transgenic animals are described in the art (e.g. M. Markkula et al. Rev. Reprod., 1, 97-106 (1996); R. T. Wall et al., J. Dairy ScL, 80, 2213-2224 (1997)), J. C. Dalton, et al. (Adv. Exp. Med. Biol, 411, 419-428 (1997)) and H. Lubon et al. (Transfus. Med. Rev., 10, 131-143 (1996)). A transposon including one or more protein encoding nucleic acids to be expressed in the transgenic animal flanked by ITRs can be introduced into a suitable cells, for example, a zygote, embryonic stem cell or adult cell for nuclear transfer together with a transposase, either in protein form or encoded by the same or different nucleic acid than the transposon. The transposon integrates into the genome of the cell. The cell is then propagated to an embryo, and then into a transgenic animal as is conventional transgenesis. [00218] In another embodiment, the present invention features a transgenic animal produced by the methods described herein, preferably by using the gene transfer system presently described. For example, transgenic animals may preferably contain a nucleic acid sequence inserted into the genome of the animal by the gene transfer system, thereby enabling the transgenic animal to produce its gene product, for example, a protein. In transgenic animals this protein is preferably a product for isolation from a cell, for example the inventive protein can be produced in quantity in milk, urine, blood or eggs. Promoters can be used that promote expression in milk, urine, blood or eggs and these promoters include, but are not limited to, casein promoter, the mouse urinary protein promoter, beta-globin promoter and the ovalbumin promoter respectively. Recombinant growth hormone, recombinant insulin, and a variety of other recombinant proteins have been produced using other methods for producing protein in a cell. Nucleic acids encoding these or other proteins can be inserted into the transposon of this invention and transfected into a cell. Expression from a transposon of the present invention can be improved when a transposase protein is present to catalyze integration of the transposon into the DNA of a cell. Where the cell is part of a tissue or part of transgenic animal, large amounts of recombinant protein can be obtained. Transgenic animals may be selected from vertebrates and invertebrates, for example, fish, birds, mammals including, but not limited to, rodents, such as rats or mice, ungulates, such as cows or goats, sheep, swine or humans. [00219] The present invention furthermore provides a method for gene therapy comprising the step of introducing the gene transfer system into cells as described herein. Therefore, the transposon as described herein preferably comprises a gene to provide a gene therapy to a cell or an organism. Preferably, the gene is placed under the control of a tissue specific promoter or of a ubiquitous promoter or one or more other expression control regions for the expression of a gene in a cell in need of that gene. Presently, a variety of genes are being tested for a variety of gene therapies including, but not limited to, the CFTR gene for cystic fibrosis, adenosine deaminase (ADA) for immune system disorders, factor IX and interleukin-2 (IL-2) for blood cell diseases, alpha- 1 -antitrypsin for lung disease, and tumor necrosis factors (INFs) and multiple drug resistance (MDR) proteins for cancer therapies. These and a variety of human or animal specific gene sequences including gene sequences to encode marker proteins and a variety of recombinant proteins are available in the known gene databases such as GenBank. [00220] An advantage of the gene transfer system of the present invention for gene therapy purposes is that it is limited to a much lesser extent by the size of the polynucleotide between the transposon ends than is the case for many other gene transfer systems. There is no known limit on the size of the nucleic acid sequence that can be inserted into DNA of a cell using the transposase proteins of the present invention. In particular preferred embodiments, for gene therapy purposes, but also for other inventive purposes, the gene transfer system may be transfected into cells by a variety of methods including by microinjection, lipid- mediated strategies or by viral-mediated strategies. For example, where microinjection is used, there is very little restraint on the size of the intervening sequence of the transposon of this invention. Similarly, lipid-mediated strategies do not have substantial size limitations. However, other strategies for introducing the gene transfer system into a cell, such as viral-mediated strategies could limit the length of the nucleic acid sequence positioned between the repeats. [00221] Accordingly, in certain exemplary embodiments, the gene transfer system as described herein can be delivered to cells via viruses, including retroviruses (such as lentiviruses), adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, herpes viruses, and others. There are several potential combinations of delivery mechanisms that are possible for the transposon portion containing the heterologous polynucleotide flanked by the terminal repeats and the gene encoding the transposase. For example, both the transposon and the transposase gene can be contained together on the same recombinant viral genome; a single infection delivers both parts of the gene transfer system such that expression of the transposase then directs cleavage of the transposon from the recombinant viral genome for subsequent insertion into a cellular chromosome. In another example, the transposase and the transposon can be delivered separately by a combination of viruses and/or non- viral systems such as lipid- containing reagents. In these cases either the transposon and/or the transposase gene can be delivered by a recombinant virus. In every case, the expressed transposase gene directs liberation of the transposon from its carrier DNA (viral genome) for insertion into chromosomal DNA. In certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, transposons may be utilized for insertional mutagenesis, preferably followed by identification of the mutated gene. DNA transposons, particularly the transposons, have several advantages compared to approaches in the prior art, for example, with respect to viral and retroviral methods. For example, unlike proviral insertions, transposon insertions can be remobilized by supplying the transposase activity in trans. Thus, instead of performing time-consuming microinjections, it is possible according to the present invention to generate transposon insertions at new loci by crossing stocks transgenic for the above mentioned two components of the transposon system, the transposon and the transposase. In a preferred embodiment the gene transfer system is directed to the germline of the experimental animals to mutagenize germ cells. Alternatively, transposase expression can be directed to particular tissues or organs by using a variety of specific promoters. In addition, remobilization of a mutagenic transposon out of its insertion site can be used to isolate revertants and, if transposon excision is associated with a deletion of flanking DNA, the gene transfer system of the present invention may be used to generate deletion mutations. Furthermore, since transposons are composed of DNA, and can be maintained in simple plasmids, gene transfer systems and transposons of the present invention are much safer and easier to work with than highly infectious retroviruses. The transposase activity can be supplied in the form of DNA, mRNA or protein as defined above in the desired experimental phase. [00222] In another embodiment, the present invention also provides an efficient system for gene discovery, for example genome mapping, by introducing a transposon as defined above into a gene using a gene transfer system as described in the present invention. In one example, the transposon in combination with the transposase protein or a nucleic acid encoding the transposase protein is transfected into a cell. In certain preferred embodiments, the transposon preferably comprises a nucleic acid sequence positioned between at least two repeats, wherein the repeats bind to transposase protein and wherein the transposon is inserted into the DNA of the cell in the presence of the transposase protein. In certain preferred embodiments, the nucleic acid sequence includes a marker protein, such as GFP and a restriction endonuclease recognition site. Following insertion, the cell DNA is isolated and digested with the restriction endonuclease. For example, if the endonuclease recognition site is a 6-base recognition site and a restriction endonuclease is used that employs a 6-base recognition sequence, the cell DNA is cut into about 4000-bp fragments on average. These fragments can be either cloned or linkers can be added to the ends of the digested fragments to provide complementary sequence for PCR primers. Where linkers are added, PCR reactions are used to amplify fragments using primers from the linkers and primers binding to the direct repeats of the repeats in the transposon. The amplified fragments are then sequenced and the DNA flanking the direct repeats is used to search computer databases such as GenBank. [00223] In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the invention provides a method for mobilizing a nucleic acid sequence in a cell. According to this method the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposon is inserted into DNA of a cell, as described herein. A protein or nucleic acid encoding the Bombyx mori or Xenopus tropicalis transposase protein is transfected into the cell and the protein is able to mobilize (i.e. move) the transposon from a first position within the DNA of the cell to a second position within the DNA of the cell. The DNA of the cell is preferably genomic DNA or extrachromosomal DNA. The inventive method allows movement of the transposon from one location in the genome to another location in the genome, or for example, from a plasmid in a cell to the genome of that cell. [00224] In other embodiments, the gene transfer system can also be used as part of a method involving RNA- interference techniques. RNA interference (RNAi), is a technique in which exogenous, double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), being complementary to mRNA's or genes/gene fragments of the cell, are introduced into this cell to specifically bind to a particular mRNA and/or a gene and thereby diminishing or abolishing gene expression. The technique has proven effective in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, plants, and recently, in mammalian cell cultures. To apply this technique in context with the present invention, the transposon preferably contains short hairpin expression cassettes encoding small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are complementary to mRNA's and/or genes/gene fragments of the cell. These siRNAs have preferably a length of 20 to 30 nucleic acids, more preferably a length of 20 to 25 nucleic acids and most preferably a length of 21 to 23 nucleic acids. The siRNA may be directed to any mRNA and/or a gene, that encodes any protein as defined above, e.g. an oncogene. This use, particularly the use of transposons for integration of siRNA vectors into the host genome provides a long-term expression of siRNA in vitro or in vivo and thus enables a long-term silencing of specific gene products. 5.2.9 PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS [00225] The present invention further includes pharmaceutical compositions containing either i) a Bombyx mori transposase as a protein or encoded by a nucleic acid, and/or a Bombyx mori transposon, or a gene transfer system comprising a Bombyx mori transposase as a protein or encoded by a nucleic acid, in combination with an active Bombyx mori transposon or; ii) a Xenopus tropicalis transposase as a protein or encoded by a nucleic acid, and/or a Xenopus tropicalis transposon, or a gene transfer system comprising a Xenopus tropicalis transposase as a protein or encoded by a nucleic acid, in combination with an active Xenopus tropicalis transposon.

EXAMPLES [00239] The following examples are intended to illustrate the methods, compositions and kits disclosed herein and should not be construed as limiting in any way. Various equivalents will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the following examples; such equivalents are also contemplated to be part of the invention disclosed herein. 6.1.1 STABLE INTEGRATION IN CHINESE HAMSTER OVARY (CHO) CELLS [00240] In some embodiments, a gene transfer system comprises a transposon and a transposase. The transposon comprises a heterologous expression polynucleotide that includes expression control elements and a sequence encoding a first expressible polypeptide. Cells into which the transposon and transposase have both been introduced express higher levels of the expressible polypeptide than cells into which only the transposon have been introduced. [00241] Tables 1 and 2 show data obtained from parallel triplicate experiments testing expression from an expression polynucleotide comprising a puromycin resistance gene under control of a murine PGK promoter and a DasherGFP gene under control of a human EFla promoter, with the two promoters oriented such that transcription from them is in opposite directions and divergent. The expression polynucleotide was inserted between putative pairs of transposon ends to create a series of putative transposons. SEQ IDs of the transposon ends are indicated in the tables. The transposons were then either transfected alone into CHO cells, or co-transfected with a transposase. The ratio of transposon DNA to transposase-encoding DNA is indicated in the tables. [00242] CHO-K1 cells (from ATCC) were grown in F12-K (from ATCC) + 10% FBS (from ATCC) + 1 % Penicillin-streptomycin (from ATCC) at 37°C, 5% C02 to 80% confluence. 5E+05 cells were plated in 24- well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for 24 hours prior to transfection, transfections were set up in triplicates. Each transfection used a total of 0.5 μg DNA with Lipofectamine 2000 as per manufacturer's protocol. Media with puromycin was added 72 hours post transfection. Cells were grown for 14 days post puromycin selection with two passages and two changes of media. Fluorescence of the ORF encoding fluorescent reporter DasherGFP (SEQ ID: 102) was measured at Ex/Em of 488/518 nm. [00243] A fluorescence signal that was higher in cells that received the transposon plus the transposase than the transposon alone indicated that the transposase was able to recognize the transposon ends and enhance integration into the genomic DNA, either by integrating more copies of the DNA or by integrating the DNA at places in the genome that were more favorable for expression. [00244] Table 1 shows that expression from a transposon comprising Bombyx mori transposon ends SEQ ID NOS: I and 2 is increased approximately 5-fold when the transposon is co-transfected with a vector encoding a Bombyx mori transposase SEQ ID NO: 44. Tables 1 and 2 show that expression from a transposon comprising Xenopus tropica!is transposon ends SEQ ED NOS: 5 and 6 is increased between 50% and 2.5-fold when the transposon is co-transfected with a vector encoding a Xenopus tropicalis transposase SEQ ID NO: 45 or 46, when the transposase was fused to a nuclear localization signal. [00245] Identifying and testing hyperactive variants of the identified transposases is also expressly contemplated and is another aspect of this invention. 6.1.2 INSULATOR ELEMENTS ENHANCE STABLE EXPRESSION IN CHO CELLS [00246] In some embodiments, a gene transfer system comprises a polynucleotide that includes expression control elements and a sequence encoding a first expressible polypeptide. Expression of the expressible polypeptide can be increased in some configurations of the gene transfer system by incorporating insulator sequences. In some embodiments the polynucleotide and the insulator sequences are part of a transposon, and expression can be further increased by the action of a transposase. [00247] Table 3 shows data obtained from parallel triplicate experiments testing expression from an expression polynucleotide comprising a puromycin resistance gene under control of a murine PGK promoter and a DasherGFP gene under control of a second promoter as indicated in the table. The expression polynucleotide was optionally inserted between pairs of insulator sequences as indicated in the table. The resulting polynucleotides were then inserted between pairs of transposon ends as indicated in the table. These transposons were then transfected into CHO cells, either alone or together with a transposase, as indicated in the table. The transposases in this example were fused to a heterologous nuclear localization signal. [00248] CHO-K1 cells (from ATCC) were grown in F12-K (from ATCC) + 10% FBS (from ATCC) + 1 % Penicillin-streptomycin (from ATCC) at 37°C, 5% C02 to 80% confluence. 5E+05 cells were plated in 24- well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for 24 hours prior to transfection, transfections were set up in triplicates. Each transfection used a total of 0.5 μg DNA with Roche Extreme Gene 9 reagent (2: 1 ratio) as per manufacturer's protocol. Media with 5 μg/μl puromycin was added 72 hours post transfection. Puromycin selection was carried out for 72 hours. Cells were grown for 14 days post puromycin selection with two passages and changes of media. Fluorescence represents expression of the ORF encoding fluorescent reporter DasherGFP from stably integrated transposons and was measured at Ex/Em of 488/518 nm. [00249] Table 3 shows that the presence of HS4 insulators, either the full sequence or just the core sequence, can significantly increase expression from the transposon even in the absence of a transposase (for example compare Table 3 rows 1 and 3 or rows 5 and 9). This effect appears to be influenced by the promoter that is being used to drive expression of the expressible polypeptide: in this vector context the HS4 insulator increases expression from an EF1 a promoter on the transposon by 50% to 4-fold, but there is no effect observed when the expressible polypeptide is under the control of the CMV promoter (Table 3 rows 11, 13 and 15). In the presence of the transposase, expression from almost all of the transposons increased, from 50% to more than 10-fold. Increases in expression from the transposon as a result of the insulators and the transposases appeared to be synergistic. Preferred embodiments of gene transfer systems comprise a gene encoding a Xenopus or Bombyx transposase fused to a nuclear localization signal and a Xenopus or Bombyx transposon comprising two HS4 or HS4 core insulators. 6.1.3 TRANSPOSASES CAN BE PROVIDED IN CIS OR IN TRANS [00250] In some embodiments, a gene transfer system comprises a transposon and a transposase. The transposon comprises a heterologous polynucleotide that includes expression control elements and a sequence encoding a first expressible polypeptide. In some embodiments the transposase is encoded on a polynucleotide vector that also comprises the transposon. [00251] Table 4 shows data obtained from parallel triplicate experiments testing expression from an expression polynucleotide comprising a puromycin resistance gene under control of a murine PGK promoter and a DasherGFP gene under control of a second promoter as indicated in the table. The DasherGFP gene is followed by an RNA export element, as indicated in the table. The expression polynucleotide was optionally inserted between pairs of insulator sequences as indicated in the table. The resulting polynucleotides were then inserted between pairs of transposon ends as indicated in the table. These transposons were then optionally cloned into vectors that also contained a gene for expression of a transposase, under control of a promoter as indicated (P_Transposase). Some transposases were fused to a nuclear localization signal, as indicated in the table. Transposons were then transfected into CHO cells, either alone or together with a transposase, as indicated in the table. [00252] CHO-K1 cells (from ATCC) were grown in F12-K (from ATCC) + 10% FBS (from ATCC) + 1 % Penicillin-streptomycin (from ATCC) at 37°C, 5% C02 to 80% confluence. 5E+05 cells were plated in 24- well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for 24 hours prior to transfection, transfections were set up in triplicates. Each transfection used a total of 0.5 μg DNA with Roche Extreme Gene 9 reagent (2: 1 ratio) as per manufacturer's protocol. Media with 5 μg/μl puromycin was added 72 hours post transfection. Puromycin selection was carried out for 72 hours. Cells were grown for 14 days post puromycin selection with two passages and changes of media. Fluorescence represents expression of the ORF encoding fluorescent reporter DasherGFP from stably integrated transposons and was measured at Ex/Em of 488/518 nm. [00253] Table 4 shows that expression of transposase from the same vector that contained the transposon produced comparable levels of expression improvement to the expression increases obtained by co-transfecting a second plasmid carrying the gene for the transposase. This improvement is observed in many different vector configurations, as shown in the table. Thus expression from a Bombyx mori transposon or a Xenopus tropicalis transposon can be increased by the action of a transposase that is provided either in cis or in trans. [00254] The transposons described in Table 4 also comprised an RNA export element selected from WPRE and HPRE; they also comprised the expression enhancing element SARI. Preferred embodiments of gene transfer vectors comprise one or more of these elements. 6.1.4 TRANSPOSASES WITH NUCLEAR LOCALIZATION SIGNALS [00255] In some embodiments, a gene transfer system comprises a transposon and a transposase, where the transposase is fused with a nuclear localization signal. The transposon comprises a heterologous polynucleotide that includes expression control elements and a sequence encoding a first expressible polypeptide. Cells into which the transposon and transposase fused to the nuclear localization signal have both been introduced express higher levels of the expressible polypeptide than cells into which only the transposon have been introduced. [00256] Table 5 shows data obtained from parallel triplicate experiments testing expression from an expression polynucleotide comprising a puromycin resistance gene under control of a murine PGK promoter, with a DasherGFP gene translationally coupled to the puromycin- resistance gene through a CHYSEL sequence. The expression polynucleotide was inserted between putative pairs of transposon ends to create a series of putative transposons. SEQ IDs of the transposon ends are indicated in the tables. The transposons were then either transfected alone into CHO cells, or co-transfected with a transposase fused to a nuclear localization sequence. The ratio of transposon DNA to transposase-encoding DNA is indicated in the tables. [00257] CHO-K1 cells (from ATCC) were grown in F12-K (from ATCC) + 10% FBS (from ATCC) + 1 % Penicillin-streptomycin (from ATCC) at 37°C, 5% C02 to 80% confluence. 5E+05 cells were plated in 24- well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for 24 hours prior to transfection, transfections were set up in triplicates. Each transfection used a total of 0.5 μg DNA with Lipofectamine 2000 as per manufacturer's protocol. Media with puromycin was added 72 hours post transfection. Cells were grown for 14 days post puromycin selection with two passages and two changes of media. Fluorescence of the ORF encoding fluorescent reporter DasherGFP was measured at Ex/Em of 488/518 nm. [00258] A fluorescence signal that was higher in cells that received the transposon plus the transposase fused to the nuclear localization signal than the transposon alone indicated that the transposase fused to the nuclear localization signal was able to recognize the transposon ends and enhance integration into the genomic DNA, either by integrating more copies of the DNA or by integrating the DNA at places in the genome that were more favorable for expression. [00259] Trichoplusia ni piggyBac and Bombyx mori and Xenopus tropicalis transposases were all active when fused to N-terminus nuclear localization signals (NLS). A preferred embodiment of a gene transfer system comprises a gene encoding a transposase that is fused to a nuclear localization signal. 6.1.5 STABLE INTEGRATION IN HUMAN EMBRYONIC KIDNEY (HEK 293) CELLS [00260] In some embodiments the gene transfer system comprises a transposon and transposase that are used to integrate an expression polynucleotide into the genome of a mammalian cell; in some embodiments the cell is a CHO cell, in some embodiments the cell is an HEK cell. [00261] Table 6 shows data obtained from parallel triplicate experiments testing expression from an expression polynucleotide in a Xenopus transposon with ends SEQ ID NO: 9 and 6, comprising a puromycin resistance gene under control of a murine PGK promoter. The expression polynucleotide further comprised a DasherGFP gene operably linked to various promoters, introns, RNA export sequences and polyadenylation sequences as indicated in the table. Transcription from the two promoters was in opposite directions and divergent. The transposons were then either transfected alone into HEK cells, or co-transfected with a gene encoding Xenopus transposase SEQ ID NO: 45 fused to a nuclear localization sequence. [00262] HEK 293 cells were grown in EMEM (from ATCC) + 10% FBS (from ATCC) + 1 % Penicillin-streptomycin (from ATCC) at 37°C, 5% C02 to 80% confluence. 5E+05 cells were plated in 24- well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for 24 hours prior to transfection, transfections were set up in triplicates. Each transfection used a total of 0.5 μg DNA with Roche Extreme Gene 9 reagent (2: 1 ratio) as per manufacturer's protocol. Media with 5 μg/μl puromycin was added 72 hours post transfection. Puromycin selection was carried out for 72 hours and passaged into complete media minus puromycin. Cells were grown for 14 days post puromycin selection with two passages and changes of media. Fluorescence represents expression of the ORF encoding fluorescent reporter DasherGFP from stably integrated transposons and was measured at Ex/Em of 488/518 nm. [00263] All gene transfer vector configurations tested showed improved expression in HEK cells when the transposase gene was co-transfected. Preferred embodiments of a gene transfer vector include all vector configurations shown in Table 6 6.1.6 EXPRESSION LEVELS OF TWO POLYPEPTIDES USING IRES ELEMENTS IN TRANSIENT EXPRESSION IN HEK293 AND CHO CELLS [00264] In some embodiments a gene transfer system comprises genes encoding two polypeptides. In some embodiments the two polypeptides are encoded on a single polynucleotide. In some embodiments the two polypeptides interact after they are synthesized. In some embodiments the relative amounts of the two polypeptides expressed by a cell is important for the functioning of the two polypeptides. In some embodiments the two polypeptides are enzymes in a pathway. In some embodiments the two polypeptides bind together or are subunits of a larger molecule; in some embodiments the two polypeptides are the heavy and light chains of an antibody. [00265] Tables 7-11 show the expression levels observed in HEK and CHO cells for two different polypeptides (in this case two different fluorescent proteins, Dasher GFP and CayenneRFP) encoded on a single gene transfer vector. The genes for the two different proteins were operably linked to a single enhancer, promoter, polyadenylation signal and optionally an intron, as indicated in the tables. Expression of the two genes was operably linked by an IRES element, as indicated in the tables, with the order of elements being DasherGFP-IRES-CayenneRFP. [00266] HEK 293a cells (from ATCC) were grown in EMEM (from ATCC) + 10% FBS (from ATCC) + 1 % Penicillin-streptomycin (from ATCC) at 37°C, 5% C02 to 80% confluence, 1E+05 cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for 24 hours prior to transfection, transfections were set up in triplicates. Each transfection used 0.5 μg DNA with Lipofectamine 2000 as per manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 72 hours post transfection. Fluorescence of the two ORFs encoding fluorescent reporters DasherGFP (SEQ ID NO: 102) and CayenneRFP (SEQ ID NO: 103) was measured at Ex/Em of 488/518 nm for DasherGFP and Ex/Em of 525/580 nm for CayenneRFP. [00267] CHO-Kl cells (from ATCC) were grown in F12-K (from ATCC) + 10% FBS (from ATCC) + 1 % Penicillin-streptomycin (from ATCC) at 37°C, 5% C02 to 80% confluence. 5E+05 cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for 24 hours prior to transfection, transfections were set up in triplicates. Each transfection used 0.5 μg DNA with Lipofectamine 2000 as per manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 72 hours post transfection. Fluorescence of the two ORFs encoding fluorescent reporters DasherGFP and CayenneRFP was measured at Ex/Em of 488/518 nm for DasherGFP and Ex/Em of 525/580 nm for CayenneRFP. [00268] Gene transfer vectors comprising the two proteins translationally coupled by a CHYSEL sequence (e.g. construct 135171 in Table 7) express the two proteins at an equimolar ratio and can be used to normalize for different fluorescent intensities of the proteins. Tables 7-11 show that different IRES elements can be used to obtain different ratios of expression between two different polynucleotides in a variety of vector configurations. The use of IRES elements is particularly advantageous for expression of polypeptides when the ratio of expression is important at the level of individual cells, for example in the expression of antibodies where the light chain is often thought to perform a chaperonin function for the heavy chain. [00269] We have identified IRES elements that show different levels of activity as seen from the varying expression levels for the two open reading frames (ORFs) linked by an IRES element (Tables 7-11). A choice of IRES elements with varying activities allows the appropriate IRES element to be used for controlling the relative expression levels of two ORFs. This is especially useful for expression of antibodies wherein the ratios of expression of the heavy chain to light chain influences proper assembly of the functional antibody. Use of the identified IRES elements for antibody expression is an important aspect of this invention. We have shown use of one IRES element linking two transcripts operably linked to one promoter, similarly use of two or more IRES elements linking three or more ORFs is expressly contemplated and is another aspect of the invention. Expression constructs with two or more IRES elements selected such that transcript levels of two or more ORFs is selectively modulated is expressly contemplated and is an important aspect of the invention. The identified IRES elements of the invention work well in both transient and stable integration vectors in the two cell lines tested, Human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Preferred embodiments of a gene transfer vector include all vector configurations shown in Tables 7-11, and all IRES elements shown in these tables. 6.1.7 EXPRESSION OF ANTIBODIES USING IRES ELEMENTS IN TRANSIENTLY TRANSFECTED HEK293 CELLS [00270] In some embodiments the gene transfer system is used to express an antibody. In some embodiments genes encoding the two antibody chains are operably linked to separate promoters. In some embodiments genes encoding the two chains are operably linked to the same promoter and to each other by a translational coupling element, in some embodiments the translational coupling element is an IRES or a CHYSEL sequence. [00271] Table 12 shows a variety of vector configurations expressing two antibody chains from a single gene transfer vector. In some configurations genes encoding the two chains were each operably linked to separate promoters and polyadenylation signals, in some configurations the genes were operably linked to a single promoter preceding the first gene and a single poly A signal following the second gene, where the two genes are operably linked by an IRES sequence. The number 1 indicates promoters preceding or polyA signals following the first gene, the number 2 indicates promoters preceding or polyA signals following the second gene. [00272] All of these vectors further comprised a viral amplification sequence encoding the SV40T antigen, and the SV40 origin of replication. Antibody expression from these gene transfer vectors was measured by ELISA, and compared with the expression obtained by co- transfection of two gene transfer vectors, one encoding the heavy chain and the other encoding the light chain, transfected at different ratios as indicated in the table. [00273] HEK 293a cells (from ATCC) were grown in EMEM (from ATCC) + 10% FBS (from ATCC) + 1 % Penicillin-streptomycin (from ATCC) at 37°C, 5% C02 to 80% confluence, 1E+05 cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for 24 hours prior to transfection, transfections were set up in triplicates. Each transfection used 0.5 μg DNA with Lipofectamine 2000 as per manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 72 hours post transfection. Culture supernatants were harvested and used in an ELISA assay for quantitation of heavy chain (HC) (Table 12) and run on a gel for a western blot for detection of the heavy and light chains (data not shown). [00274] 96-well ELISA plates (Cat. No. M9410, Sigma) were coated with 50 μΐ per well of goat anti-Human IgG (Fc specific) antibody (Cat No. 12136, Sigma) at 1 μg/ml in 1XPBS (Cat. No. P-7059, Sigma) and incubated overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed 4 times with 300 μΐ per well PBST (Cat. No. P3563, Sigma) and blocked with 300 μΐ per well ELISA Block solution (PBST + 1 % BSA (Cat. No. 85040C), Sigma) for 1 hour at room temperature. ELISA Block solution was removed and culture supernatants from the transient transfections above diluted in ELISA Block solution at dilutions ranging from 1 :50 to 1 :200,000 at 100 μΐ per well were added to plates and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed 4 times with 300 μΐ per well PBST (Sigma) and antibody was detected by incubation with 100 μΐ/well (0.16 g/ml) HRP conjugated-goat anti-Human IgG (Fab specific) (Cat. No. 31482, Thermo Scientific) in ELISA Block solution for 1 hour at room temperature. Plates were washed 4 times with 300 μΐ per well PBST (Sigma) and bound HRP-goat anti-Human IgG measured by adding 100 μΐ/well QuantaBlu Fluorogenic Peroxidase substrate (Cat. No. 15162, Thermo Scientific). Plates were incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature, reaction stopped by adding 100 μΐ/well stop solution (Cat. No. 15162, Thermo Scientific) and fluorescence measured using fluorimeter at excitation (Ex) 325 nm and emission (Em) 420 nm. Antibody concentration was calculated by comparing to a standard curve generated using dilutions of purified Human IgG (Thermo Scientific) using a 4-parameter logistic curve fit. Concentrations of IgG calculated shown in Table 12 were in good agreement with quantitation from western blot (data not shown). [00275] Table 12 shows that many gene transfer vector configurations using dual promoters or IRES elements produce comparable or better antibody expression than co-transfection of two separate gene transfer vectors. Preferred embodiments of a gene transfer vector include all vector configurations shown in Table 12, and all IRES elements shown in Tables 7-11. [00276] Using IRES sequences which can produce different levels of expression of the second polypeptide relative to the first has advantages over methods wherein dual - transfections are used. In the case of co-transfection, indi vidual cells take up different numbers of each plasmid. Because it is only possible to control the average number of each plasmid taken up by each cell, many cells do not end up expressing the optimal ratio of heavy and light chain. This problem is amplified in the case of stable ceil lines, because there is the further variable of integration location which also affects expression levels. Use of IRES sequences to control expression levels of two or more ORFs, in particular expression of ORFs encoding heav and light chains in stable integration expression vectors is expressly contemplated and is an important aspect of the invention. 6.1.8 EXPRESSION OF TWO ORFS LINKED BY IRES ELEMENTS IN STABLY TRANSFECTED CHO CELLS [00277] In some embodiments a gene transfer system comprises genes encoding two polypeptides encoded on a single polynucleotide to be stably integrated into the genome of a cell. In some embodiments the polynucleotide comprises a transposon. In some embodiments the two polypeptides are the heavy and light chains of an antibody. [00278] Table 13 shows the configurations of a set of transposons comprising transposon ends SEQ ID NO: 9 and 6. Transposons comprised genes encoding DasherGFP and / or CayenneRFP as indicated in the table. In some configurations the two genes were each operably linked to separate promoters and polyadenylation signals, in some configurations the genes were operably linked to a single promoter preceding the first gene and a single polyA signal following the second gene, where the two genes are operably linked by an IRES sequence. The number 1 indicates promoters preceding or polyA signals following the first gene, the number 2 indicates promoters preceding or polyA signals following the second gene. All of these sequences further comprised an SAR sequence and an HPRE sequence following the second gene and preceding polyA2. Transposons were transfected into CHO cells, either alone or together with a gene encoding a transposase (SEQ ID NO: 45) fused to a nuclear localization signal. [00279] CHO-K1 cells (from ATCC) were grown in F12-K (from ATCC) + 10% FBS (from ATCC) + 1 % Penicillin-streptomycin (from ATCC) at 37°C, 5% C02 to 80% confluence. 5E+05 cells were plated in 24- well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for 24 hours prior to transfection, transfections were set up in triplicates. Each transfection used a total of 0.5 μg DNA with Roche Extreme Gene 9 reagent (2:1 ratio) as per manufacturer's protocol. Media with 5 μg/μl puromycin was added 72 hours post transfection. Puromycin selection was carried out for 72 hours. Cells were grown for 14 days post puromycin selection with two passages and changes of media. Fluorescence represents expression of the ORFs encoding fluorescent reporter DasherGFP from stably integrated transposons measured at Ex/Em of 488/518 nm and CayenneRFP was measured at Ex/Em of 525/580 nm. [00280] Co-transfection of transposons with the vector encoding the transposase increased expression of both proteins encoded by the transposon between 4-fold and nearly 20-fold relative to transfections with the transposon alone. A transposon comprising genes encoding two polypeptides and a gene encoding a transposase fused to a nuclear localization signal is a preferred embodiment of a gene transfer system. Configurations shown in Table 13 are preferred embodiments. [00281] Figure 4 shows FACS analysis of populations of cells transfected with the gene transfer systems described in Table 13 rows 3 and 4. 6.1.9 STABLE INTEGRATION OF TRANSPOSONS IN CHINESE HAMSTER OVARY (CHO) CELLS [00282] In some embodiments, a gene transfer system comprises a transposon and a transposase. The transposon comprises a heterologous expression polynucleotide that includes expression control elements and a sequence encoding a first expressible polypeptide. Cells into which the transposon and transposase have both been introduced express higher levels of the expressible polypeptide than cells into which only the transposon have been introduced. In some embodiments the cell is a mammalian cell, in some embodiments the cell is a CHO cell or an HEK cell. [00283] Table 14 shows a set of gene transfer vector configurations for expression of a DasherGFP. Each vector comprised transposon ends SEQ ID NO: 9 and 6. All of these sequences except for 192462 further comprised an S AR sequence and an HPRE sequence following the sequence encoding DasherGFP. All of these sequences further comprised a rabbit globin polyA sequence. Some transposons further comprised a pair of HS4 insulator sequences between the transposon ends, as indicated in the table. Transposons were transfected into CHO cells, either alone or together with a gene encoding a transposase (SEQ ID NO: 45) fused to a nuclear localization signal. [00284] Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown and transfected as described in Example 6.2 above. [00285] Table 14 shows that expression from the transposon was increased for each configuration tested by co-transfection with a gene encoding the transposase. The expression increases were between 2-fold and 80-fold. Gene transfer systems comprising a transposase and a transposon with a configuration shown in Table 14 are preferred embodiments of the invention. [00286] Figure 3 shows a FACS analysis of the same stably transfected cell populations as shown in Table 14. FACS shows the expression level of DasherGFP in individual cells in the stably transfected population. Figure 3 shows that for every gene transfer vector in the set, the transposase causes a shift of a part of the population from the poorly expressing group to the highly expressing group. This may be caused by an increase in the number of copies of the transposon that have been stably integrated, or it may be caused by the transposon integrating into genomic loci that result in improved expressibility. [00287] We have shown preferred configurations of vector elements including enhancers, promoters, introns, 5' UTRs, RNA export sequences, poly A and insulators that contribute to expression activity seen from integrated transposons. Other vector configurations of control elements shown in Tables 15-18, placed into a transposon context for stable integration, are also preferred embodiments. [00288] In a preferred embodiment for stable integration into a mammalian genome, a gene transfer vector comprises a transposon for expression of a first polynucleotide, wherein the expression of the first polynucleotide is operably linked to a mammalian promoter selected from amongst the EFla (translation elongation factor la) promoter from any mammalian or avian species including but not limited to human, rat, mice, chicken and Chinese hamster; the CMV (cytomegalovirus) promoter; the GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3 -phosphate dehydrogenase) promoter from any mammalian species; the MCI and HSV-TK (Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase ) viral promoters; the actin promoter from any mammalian or avian species including but not limited to human, rat, mice, chicken and Chinese hamster; the PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase) promoter from any mammalian or avian species including but not limited to human, rat, mice, chicken and Chinese hamster; the SV40 (Simian virus 40) promoter and the ubiquitin promoter. In preferred embodiments the promoter may be operably linked to an enhancer selected from amongst the CMV immediate early enhancer, the EFla enhancer (for example but not limited to SEQ ID NO: 116), the adenoviral major late protein enhancer (for example but not limited to SEQ ID NO: 118), the SV40 enhancer (for example but not limited to SEQ ID NO: 117), and a retroviral LTR. In further preferred embodiments expression of the first polynucleotide is operably linked to an intron selected from among a CMV(cytomegalovirus) intron, including CMV introns A, B and C; an EFla (translation elongation factor la) intron from any mammalian or avian species including but not limited to human, rat, mice, chicken and Chinese hamster; the actin intron from any mammalian or avian species including but not limited to human, rat, mice, chicken and Chinese hamster; a GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3 -phosphate dehydrogenase) intron from any mammalian or avian species including but not limited to human, rat, mice, chicken and Chinese hamster; synthetic introns (for example but not limited to SEQ ID NO: 119) and chimeric natural introns (for example SEQ ID NO: 123). In further preferred embodiments expression of the first polynucleotide is operably linked to an RNA export element (for example but not limited to SEQ ID NOS: 104-107), an insulator sequence (for example but not limited to SEQ ID NOS: 112-113), or an expression enhancing element (for example but not limited to SEQ ID NOS: 108-111). [00289] Regardless of their actual mechanism, we have shown incorporation of expression enhancing elements into gene transfer vectors with transposon ends greatly enhances protein expression from these vectors, both in the absence and presence of transposase. [00290] In addition to vector elements within the transposon, use of vector elements located in the vector such that these elements are not transposed by the transposase, for example viral replication elements such as SV40 origin of replication (SV40 ori) with the SV40 large T antigen and EBV (Epstein Barr virus) oriP with EBNA (Epstein -Barr nuclear antigen) is another aspect of the invention. 6.1.10 CREATING AND TESTING COMBINATIONS OF VECTOR ELEMENTS IN TRANSIENTLY TRANSFECTED HEK AND CHO CELLS [00291] In some embodiments preferred configurations of expression control elements in a gene transfer vector are determined by creating a set of vectors comprising different combinations of elements, and then measuring expression from the set. In preferred embodiments the set comprises between 5 and 200 members, in preferred embodiments the set comprises between 10 and 100 members, in preferred embodiments the set comprises between 15 and 60 members. [00292] 48 vectors were designed such that the set of vectors comprised 3 different enhancer elements (CMV, SV40, none); 9 different promoter elements (CMV, Ub-B, SV40, PGK, MCI, HSV-TK, GAPDH, EFla, chick actin); 10 different intron elements (CMV intron a, CMV intron c, chick actin (partial), GAPDH, chick actin/rabbit, EFla-vl, EFla-v2, EFla- hybrid, synthetic and none); 2 different 5' UTRs (CMV and none); 7 different polyadenylation sequences (SV40 late, SV40 early, bovine growth hormone, synthetic, human beta globin, rabbit beta globin, HSV-TK); 3 different viral replication origins (Epstein Barr virus oriP, SV40 ori and none) and 3 different viral replication proteins (Epstein Barr virus EBNA, SV40 T antigen and none). The specific combinations in the set are shown in Table 15. The total number of possible combinations of these elements is 34,020. [00293] Dasher GFP was cloned into each of the vectors, and each construct was transfected in triplicate into HEK cells and CHO cells. Cells were plated in 24-well plates in DMEM (ATCC) + 10% FBS + Penicillin/Streptomycin for HEK293a cells and F12K (ATCC) + 10% FBS + Penicillin/Streptomycin for CHO-K1 cells and grown for 24 hours to approximately 70-80% confluence. Cells were transfected in duplicate in 24-well plates using 1 μΐ Lipofectamine 2000 per 0.5 μg DNA. After 72 hours the cells were lysed using 200 μΐ/well M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific Pierce®) and total fluorescence measured on a fluorescence plate reader at excitation/emission wavelengths of 505/525 nm. The average fluorescence readings are shown in Table 19. [00294] Partial Least Squares regression models were constructed from the fluorescence data, and regression weights were calculated for each of the sequence elements. The regression weights indicate the importance of the element for performance of the vector. It is clear that some elements or combinations of elements are more favorable for expression in both HEK and CHO (CMV enhancer, promoter and CMV intron a for example); some elements are more favorable for expression in HEK but less favorable for expression in CHO (SV40 ori plus SV40 T antigen, HSVTK polyadenylation signal, EBV oriP); some elements are more favorable for expression in CHO but less favorable for expression in HEK (GAPDH promoter, human beta globin polyadenylation signal); some elements are less favorable for expression in either HEK or CHO (SV40 late polyadenylation signal, HSV-TK promoter). [00295] Particularly favorable for expression in HEK cells were vectors that contained the SV40 origin of replication and the SV40 T antigen. These were even more effective when combined with the CMV enhancer plus the chick actin promoter plus the chick actin/rabbit intron, or the CMV enhancer with the CMV promoter with CMV intron a. Particularly favorable for expression in CHO cells were vectors that lacked any viral replication sequences. Vector configurations shown in Table 15 are preferred embodiments of the invention. 6.1.11 CREATING AND TESTING A SECOND SET OF COMBINATIONS OF VECTOR ELEMENTS IN TRANSIENTLY TRANSFECTED HEK AND CHO CELLS [00296] In some embodiments preferred configurations of expression control elements in a gene transfer vector are determined by creating a set of vectors comprising different combinations of elements, measuring expression from the set, and then designing a second set of vectors in which the most favorable elements for expression from the first set are retained and recombined, and, optionally, new elements are added into the new set of vectors. In preferred embodiments the second set comprises between 5 and 200 members, in preferred embodiments the second set comprises between 10 and 100 members, in preferred embodiments the second set comprises between 15 and 60 members. [00297] 48 vectors were designed such that the set of vectors comprised 4 different enhancer elements (CMV, synthetic, EFla, none); 4 different promoter elements (CMV, GAPDH, EFla, EFla_LTR-HTLV); 6 different intron elements (CMV intron a, CMV intron c, GAPDH, chick actin/rabbit, EFla and none); 8 different 5' UTRs (CMV, satellite tobacco necrosis virus (sTNV), human beta globin, polyhedrin, tobacco necrosis virus (TNV), barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), Xenopus globin, and none); 6 different 3' UTRs (satellite tobacco necrosis virus (sTNV), polyhedrin, tobacco necrosis virus (TNV), barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), Xenopus globin, and none); 6 different polyadenylation sequences (bovine growth hormone, bovine growth hormone plus gastrin terminator, rabbit beta globin, rabbit beta globin plus gastrin terminator, HSV-TK, HSV-TK plus gastrin terminator); 3 different viral replication origins (Epstein Barr virus oriP, SV40 ori and none) and 3 different viral replication proteins (Epstein Barr virus EBNA, SV40 T antigen and none). The specific combinations in the set are shown in Table 16. The total number of possible combinations of these elements is 248,832. [00298] Dasher GFP was cloned into each of the vectors, and each construct was transfected in triplicate into HEK cells and CHO cells. Cells were plated in 24-well plates in DMEM (ATCC) + 10% FBS + Penicillin/Streptomycin for HEK293a cells and F12K (ATCC) + 10% FBS + Penicillin/Streptomycin for CHO-K1 cells and grown for 24 hours to approximately 70-80% confluence. Cells were transfected in duplicate in 24-well plates using 1 μΐ Lipofectamine 2000 per 0.5 μg DNA. After 72 hours the cells were lysed using 200 μΐ/well M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific Pierce®) and total fluorescence measured on a fluorescence plate reader at excitation/emission wavelengths of 505/525 nm. The average fluorescence readings relative to control constructs are shown in Table 20. [00299] Partial Least Squares regression models were constructed from the fluorescence data, and regression weights were again calculated for each of the sequence elements. Again some elements are more favorable for expression in both HEK and CHO, some elements are more favorable for expression in HEK but less favorable in CHO, some elements are more favorable for expression in CHO but less favorable in HEK and some elements are less favorable for expression in both HEK and CHO. [00300] Particularly favorable for expression in HEK cells were vectors that combined the CMV enhancer with the CMV promoter, CMV intron a or intron c, and the polyadenylation signal from rabbit beta globin or the polyadenylation signal from HSV-TK plus the gastrin terminator. Even more favorable combinations also included the SV40 origin of replication and the SV40 T antigen. Vector configurations shown in Table 16 are preferred embodiments of the invention. 6.1.12 CREATING AND TESTING A SET OF COMBINATIONS OF VECTOR ELEMENTS IN TRANSIENTLY TRANSFECTED CHO CELLS [00301] In some embodiments preferred configurations of expression control elements in a gene transfer vector are determined by creating a set of vectors comprising different combinations of elements, measuring expression from the set, and then designing a second set of vectors in which the most favorable elements for expression from the first set are retained and recombined, and, optionally, new elements are added into the new set of vectors. In some embodiments this process is repeated. [00302] The most favorable elements for CHO were selected to create a third set of vectors as shown in Table 17. Dasher GFP was cloned into each of the vectors, and each construct was transfected in triplicate into CHO cells. Cells were plated in 24-well plates in DMEM (ATCC) + 10% FBS + Penicillin/Streptomycin for HEK293a cells and F12K (ATCC) + 10% FBS + Penicillin/Streptomycin for CHO-K1 cells and grown for 24 hours to approximately 70-80% confluence. Cells were transfected in duplicate in 24-well plates using 1 μΐ Lipofectamine 2000 per 0.5 μg DNA. After 72 hours the cells were lysed using 200 μΐ/well M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific Pierce®) and total fluorescence measured on a fluorescence plate reader at excitation/emission wavelengths of 505/525 nm. The average fluorescence readings relative to control constructs are shown in Table 17. [00303] Vector configurations shown in Table 17 are preferred embodiments of the invention. Particularly favorable vector elements for expression in CHO include the CMV enhancer together with the CMV promoter, the GAPDH promoter and the actin promoter. Expression is enhanced with the GAPDH intron, the CMV intron A or CMV intron C or the adenoviral major late protein enhancer. 6.1.13 CREATING AND TESTING A SET OF COMBINATIONS OF VECTOR ELEMENTS IN STABLY TRANSFECTED CHO CELLS [00304] In some embodiments a gene transfer vector comprises an RNA export element. Table 18 shows a set of different vector configurations. The vectors further comprised an SAR sequence. A gene encoding DasherGFP was cloned into the vectors, stably transfected into CHO cells, and expression of the Dasher GFP was measured. The transposons were not co-transfected with transposases. [00305] CHO-K1 cells (from ATCC) were grown in F12-K (from ATCC) + 10% FBS (from ATCC) + 1 % Penicillin-streptomycin (from ATCC) at 37°C, 5% C02 to 80% confluence. 5E+05 cells were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37°C, 5% C02 for 24 hours prior to transfection, transfections were set up in triplicates. Each transfection used a total of 0.5 μg DNA with Roche Extreme Gene 9 reagent (2:1 ratio) as per manufacturer's protocol. Media with 5 μg/μl puromycin was added 72 hours post transfection. Puromycin selection was carried out for 72 hours. Cells were grown for 14 days post puromycin selection with two passages and changes of media. Fluorescence represents expression of the ORFs encoding fluorescent reporter DasherGFP from stably integrated transposons measured at Ex/Em of 488/518 nm. [00306] Particularly favorable for expression in stably transfected CHO cells were vectors that combined the SAR plus HPRE RNA export elements. Even more favorable combinations also included the EF1 a promoter or HS4 insulators. Particularly favorable for expression in stably transfected HEK cells were vectors that combined the SAR plus HPRE or SAR plus AGS_lor SAR plus AGS_3 RNA export elements. 6.1.14 SELECTING VECTOR ELEMENTS PREFERRED BY DIFFERENT EXPRESSION SYSTEMS [00307] In some embodiments a set of gene transfer vectors are tested for an expression property of a first polynucleotide in an expression system. In some embodiments a sequence- activity model is constructed between an expression property and the element configuration in the gene transfer vectors. In some embodiments the expression system is a mammalian cell, in some embodiments the mammalian cell is an human cell or a rodent cell, in some embodiments the mammalian cell is an HEK293 cell or a Chinese hamster ovary cell. [00308] A model relating the elements of gene transfer vectors shown in Table 15, and the expression data shown in Table 19 was constructed using partial least square regression. A comparison between the measured expression property and the predicted expression property is shown in Figure 5. Table 21 shows the regression weights for each element or combination of elements calculated from the model for HEK and CHO expression systems. [00309] Table 21 shows that different combinations of elements are more favorable in different expression systems. Elements may be selected or rejected for incorporation into new vector configurations, depending on the regression weights from the model. For example the SV40 viral amplification system is highly favorable for expression in an HEK expression system (regression weight 2,679) but unfavorable for a CHO system (regression weight -113). Thus SV40 replication sequences were included in a new set of vectors designed for HEK (Table 16) but not in a new set of vectors designed for CHO (Table 17). The model also indicates that there are some polyA signals that are favorable for both systems (for example the sequence from rabbit beta globin and some that are less favorable (the SV40 late polyadenylation signal).
