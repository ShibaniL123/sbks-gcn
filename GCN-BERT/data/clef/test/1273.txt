FIELD OF THE INVENTION One or more embodiments of the invention generally relate to mementos. More particularly, the invention relates to a memento dedicated to a dead person. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The following background information may present examples of specific aspects of the prior art (e.g., without limitation, approaches, facts, or common wisdom) that, while expected to be helpful to further educate the reader as to additional aspects of the prior art, is not to be construed as limiting the present invention, or any embodiments thereof, to anything stated or implied therein or inferred thereupon. The following is an example of a specific aspect in the prior art that, while expected to be helpful to further educate the reader as to additional aspects of the prior art, is not to be construed as limiting the present invention, or any embodiments thereof, to anything stated or implied therein or inferred thereupon. By way of educational background, another aspect of the prior art generally useful to be aware of is that a memento is a keepsake or souvenir of remembrance. Often the deceased are remembered through mementos. It is known that a doll is a model of a human being or animal, often used as a toy for children. Dolls can be fabricated from various materials, including, soft fabrics, wood, clay, and rigid plastics. Dolls have traditionally been used in magic and religious rituals throughout the world. The doll can be designed to represent a specific person, or a representation of what the person embodied. Typically, grief is a multi-faceted response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or something to which a bond was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, and philosophical dimensions. Severe grief reactions may carry over into family relations, work, and health. In view of the foregoing, it is clear that these traditional techniques are not perfect and leave room for more optimal approaches.

The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. There are various types of entity mementos that may be provided by preferred embodiments of the present invention. In some embodiments, the entity memento provides a comfort and education about an entity. The entity may include a dead person, a lost person, a dead animal, and a failed organization. The memento may provide a visual depiction of the entity in the form of an entity figure. The entity figure is designed to create tactile comfort and includes various symbolic items pertinent to the entity can help in healing the emotional trauma related to the loss. Audible recordings and literature pertinent to the entity and the representation of the entity are provided. Specifically, the memento may help teach a lesson or story to benefit the mind body spirit. In some embodiments, the entity memento may form an entity figure, such as a dol. The entity figure may be configured to represent the entity. For example, without limitation, a customized entity memento may provide an entity figure and an eclectic assortment of at least one tributary item pertinent to the entity. The entity figure and the at least one tributary item may serve to console and instruct a loved one about the emotional and spiritual aspects of the loss of an entity. The customized entity memento may also serve as a prominent visual memento to the public for memorializing the entity. Those skilled in the art, in light of the present teachings, will recognize that the customized entity memento may provide a custom tailored memento object efficacious for capturing the love and emotions of a deceased or sick entity. It is well known in the art that customized mementos of the entity may be difficult to obtain in the market, especially for people who are not public figures. In some embodiments, the entity memento system may include an entity figure of a loved one who is deceased or is experiencing a health malady. The entity figure may include a doll like characterization of the entity, including, without limitation, a doll, an angel, a spirit doll, a puppet, a human, an animal, a model of the entity, a building, a plant, a company logo, and a representation of the entity. The entity figure may be sufficiently sized and dimensioned to be carried or stowed. A personalized portion may attach on to an appropriate location of the entity figure. The personalized portion may allow for identification of the entity, a eulogy for the entity, and an expression or philosophy of the entity. In one embodiment, the personalized portion may include an oval disk joined with the picture of the entity's face. The oval disk may then position onto the head of the entity figure. In some embodiments, a container portion may also join with the entity figure. The container portion provides an area created for placing items that resemble the teaching of the mind body and spirit methodology. The container portion may include, without limitation, a pouch, a bag, an envelope, and a slot. The container portion may be utilized for containing the at least one tributary item pertinent to the entity. The at least one tributary item may include, without limitation, ashes of the entity, personal property of the entity, writings from or about the entity, and any object used or known by the entity during the entity's life. Additionally, the memento may be used and to sell and connect holistic and alternative medicine teachings. In some embodiments, an extension portion may extend from the entity figure to provide a spiritual effect, and also to allow the entity figure to attach to objects. The extension portion may include, without limitation, wings, halos, arms, legs, and tails. In some embodiments, an indicia may attach to the entity figure for enhancing or highlighting the emotional or spiritual aspects of the entity. Indicia may include, without limitation, a colorful heart on the chest area of the entity figure, a religious symbol, a famous statement from the entity, a company logo, and an image pertinent to the entity. In some embodiments, an instruction portion may be included with the customized entity memento to provide information, including, without limitation, elucidation on the entity's life, lessons on grieving methods, and explaining how the entity figure may be utilized to assist in the grieving process. The instruction portion may be positioned inside the container portion. The instruction portion may utilize myriad media, including, without limitation, a book, a pamphlet, a compact disc, a hard drive, a web site, a social site, and an audio recording. The aggregate use of the above mentioned components creates a synergy that is efficacious in helping loved ones and the public deal with emotional, psychological, and spiritual aspects of the entity. FIG. 1 illustrates a detailed perspective view of an exemplary entity figure, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment, an entity memento 100 provides a comfort and education about an entity. Specifically, the memento may help teach a lesson or story to benefit the mind body spirit. In some embodiments, the entity may include, without limitation, a deceased person, a lost person, a sick person, a deceased animal, a bankrupted business, a failed organization, and a destroyed geographic area. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the death causes psychological trauma and sadness related to the loss of the entity. A visual depiction of the entity that provides tactile comfort and includes various symbolic items pertinent to the entity can help in healing the emotional trauma. Additionally, the memento may be used and to sell and connect holistic and alternative medicine teachings. In some embodiments, the entity memento can take the form of an entity FIG. 102 that visually depicts the entity by forming a visual depiction of a figurine, doll, or other tangible object. The entity figure forms a visual representation of the entity when the entity is not present, such as after death. The visual depiction of the entity along with pertinent items and ideas related to the entity may help minimize anxieties and feelings of sadness regarding the absence of the entity. In some embodiments, audible recordings and literature pertinent to the entity and the representation of the entity are provided. In one embodiment, the entity figure may include a representation of a loved one who is deceased. However, in other embodiments, the entity figure may include, without limitation, a lost or missing entity, a deceased public figure, a religious figure, a deceased or lost animal, a bankrupt business, and a political cause. In some embodiments, the entity figure may include a stuffed doll.

In some embodiments, an extension portion 106 may extend from the entity figure to represent spirituality, provide aesthetics, and to grasp objects. In one embodiment, the extension portion may be sufficiently malleable to grasp an object, so that the entity figure may attach to a loved one, or an object in proximity to the loved one. In some embodiments, the entity figure may provide a texture, surface, and composition that is comforting to hold and fondle. In one alternative embodiment, the entity figure may provide pressure and stress relief by being composed of a material suitable for squeezing with the hands. The entity figure may include a custom face, tributary items in a pouch and wings. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize, in light of the teaching of the present invention that the basic function of having a customized doll figure to hold, fondle, and carry is to capture the love and emotions into an object of the deceased that does not exist on the market. Those skilled in the art, in light of the present teachings, will recognize that quantifying the deceased entity into a customized item, such as an angel doll with the entity's face attached may help in overcoming a loss of a loved one. For example, without limitation, the loved one now has the ability to touch something that represents the deceased entity and the ability to hold memento of the entity. In some embodiments, the present invention may aid the loved ones to cope with subsequent emotional suffering and psychological challenges after the entity's death or during the entity's health malady. For example, without limitation: if a person is suffering with cancer, a healing spirit doll may be custom crested to provide emotional support; if someone suffered a tragic situation, an acceptance spirit doll may be custom created to help in the acceptance and healing process, if someone is having a baby and needs spiritual comfort and guidance, a spirit doll may be custom created to provide support, if someone needs hope for a better future or is looking for guidance, any spirit sold can be created by them to represent any emotional or psychological need at the time.

In yet another embodiment, the entity figure may include an illumination portion for highlighting specific areas on the entity figure, including, without limitation, a yellow light emitting from the wings, a red light emitting from a heart, and brown light emitting from the outer skin of an African American entity. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize, in light of and in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, that any of the foregoing steps may be suitably replaced, reordered, removed and additional steps may be inserted depending upon the needs of the particular application. Moreover, the prescribed method steps of the foregoing embodiments may be implemented using any physical and/or hardware system that those skilled in the art will readily know is suitable in light of the foregoing teachings. For any method steps described in the present application that can be carried out on a computing machine, a typical computer system can, when appropriately configured or designed, serve as a computer system in which those aspects of the invention may be embodied. Thus, the present invention is not limited to any particular tangible means of implementation. It will be further apparent to those skilled in the art that at least a portion of the novel method steps and/or system components of the present invention may be practiced and/or located in location(s) possibly outside the jurisdiction of the United States of America (USA), whereby it will be accordingly readily recognized that at least a subset of the novel method steps and/or system components in the foregoing embodiments must be practiced within the jurisdiction of the USA for the benefit of an entity therein or to achieve an object of the present invention. Thus, some alternate embodiments of the present invention may be configured to comprise a smaller subset of the foregoing means for and/or steps described that the applications designer will selectively decide, depending upon the practical considerations of the particular implementation, to carry out and/or locate within the jurisdiction of the USA. For example, any of the foregoing described method steps and/or system components which may be performed remotely over a network (e.g., without limitation, a remotely located server) may be performed and/or located outside of the jurisdiction of the USA while the remaining method steps and/or system components (e.g., without limitation, a locally located client) of the forgoing embodiments are typically required to be located/performed in the USA for practical considerations. In client-server architectures, a remotely located server typically generates and transmits required information to a US based client, for use according to the teachings of the present invention. Depending upon the needs of the particular application, it will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, in light of the teachings of the present invention, which aspects of the present invention can or should be located locally and which can or should be located remotely. Thus, for any claims construction of the following claim limitations that are construed under 35 USC §112 (6) it is intended that the corresponding means for and/or steps for carrying out the claimed function are the ones that are locally implemented within the jurisdiction of the USA, while the remaining aspect(s) performed or located remotely outside the USA are not intended to be construed under 35 USC §112 (6). All the features disclosed in this specification, including any accompanying abstract and drawings, may be replaced by alternative features serving the same, equivalent or similar purpose, unless expressly stated otherwise. Thus, unless expressly stated otherwise, each feature disclosed is one example only of a generic series of equivalent or similar features. It is noted that according to USA law 35 USC §112 (1), all claims must be supported by sufficient disclosure in the present patent specification, and any material known to those skilled in the art need not be explicitly disclosed. However, 35 USC §112 (6) requires that structures corresponding to functional limitations interpreted under 35 USC §112 (6) must be explicitly disclosed in the patent specification. Moreover, the USPTO's Examination policy of initially treating and searching prior art under the broadest interpretation of a “mean for” claim limitation implies that the broadest initial search on 112(6) functional limitation would have to be conducted to support a legally valid Examination on that USPTO policy for broadest interpretation of “mean for” claims. Accordingly, the USPTO will have discovered a multiplicity of prior art documents including disclosure of specific structures and elements which are suitable to act as corresponding structures to satisfy all functional limitations in the below claims that are interpreted under 35 USC §112 (6) when such corresponding structures are not explicitly disclosed in the foregoing patent specification. Therefore, for any invention element(s)/structure(s) corresponding to functional claim limitation(s), in the below claims interpreted under 35 USC §112 (6), which is/are not explicitly disclosed in the foregoing patent specification, yet do exist in the patent and/or non-patent documents found during the course of USPTO searching, Applicant(s) incorporate all such functionally corresponding structures and related enabling material herein by reference for the purpose of providing explicit structures that implement the functional means claimed. Applicant(s) request(s) that fact finders during any claims construction proceedings and/or examination of patent allowability properly identify and incorporate only the portions of each of these documents discovered during the broadest interpretation search of 35 USC §112 (6) limitation, which exist in at least one of the patent and/or non-patent documents found during the course of normal USPTO searching and or supplied to the USPTO during prosecution. Applicant(s) also incorporate by reference the bibliographic citation information to identify all such documents comprising functionally corresponding structures and related enabling material as listed in any PTO Form-892 or likewise any information disclosure statements (IDS) entered into the present patent application by the USPTO or Applicant(s) or any 3rd parties. Applicant(s) also reserve its right to later amend the present application to explicitly include citations to such documents and/or explicitly include the functionally corresponding structures which were incorporate by reference above. Thus, for any invention element(s)/structure(s) corresponding to functional claim limitation(s), in the below claims, that are interpreted under 35 USC §112 (6), which is/are not explicitly disclosed in the foregoing patent specification, Applicant(s) have explicitly prescribed which documents and material to include the otherwise missing disclosure, and have prescribed exactly which portions of such patent and/or non-patent documents should be incorporated by such reference for the purpose of satisfying the disclosure requirements of 35 USC §112 (6). Applicant(s) note that all the identified documents above which are incorporated by reference to satisfy 35 USC §112 (6) necessarily have a filing and/or publication date prior to that of the instant application, and thus are valid prior documents to incorporated by reference in the instant application. Having fully described at least one embodiment of the present invention, other equivalent or alternative methods of implementing a customized memento for an entity according to the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Various aspects of the invention have been described above by way of illustration, and the specific embodiments disclosed are not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed. The particular implementation of the customized memento for an entity may vary depending upon the particular context or application. By way of example, and not limitation, the customized memento for an entity described in the foregoing were principally directed to a doll like figurine that provides comfort and education about a deceased person implementations; however, similar techniques may instead be applied to failed businesses that can have an entity to remember any of past success, job creation, and general memories about the work place, which implementations of the present invention are contemplated as within the scope of the present invention. The invention is thus to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the following claims. It is to be further understood that not all of the disclosed embodiments in the foregoing specification will necessarily satisfy or achieve each of the objects, advantages, or improvements described in the foregoing specification. Claim elements and steps herein may have been numbered and/or lettered solely as an aid in readability and understanding. Any such numbering and lettering in itself is not intended to and should not be taken to indicate the ordering of elements and/or steps in the claims. The corresponding structures, materials, acts, and equivalents of all means or step plus function elements in the claims below are intended to include any structure, material, or act for performing the function in combination with other claimed elements as specifically claimed. The Abstract is provided to comply with 37 C.F.R. Section 1.72(b) requiring an abstract that will allow the reader to ascertain the nature and gist of the technical disclosure. It is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to limit or interpret the scope or meaning of the claims.
