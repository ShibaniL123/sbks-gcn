Step 5: Synthesis of 4-(4-(3-fluoro-4-(7-hydroxyhepta-1,3-diyn-1-yl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-N-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)butanamide
To a solution of of 4-(4-(3-fluoro-4-(7-hydroxyhepta-1,3-diyn-1-yl)phenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoic acid (119 mg, 1 eq) in DMF (10 ml) was added with HATU (137 mg, 1.4 eq), HOBT (55 mg, 1.4 eq), Et3N (0.11 ml, 3 eq) and O-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride (60 mg, 2 eq). The mixture was stirred for 1 hr at room temperature, and extracted with ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (127 mg, 88%).
