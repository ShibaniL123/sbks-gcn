Method and apparatus for controlling a cooking process of a food FIELD OF THE INVENTION Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to cooking process control, and particularly, to a method, apparatus, and computer program product for cooking process control based on detection of the initial status of food. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It will be appreciated that the initial status of a certain type of food to be cooked may have some impact on the control of the cooking process. As used herein, the "initial status" refers to the status of food at or near the start of the cooking process. For example, the initial status may include whether the food is frozen or non- frozen, frozen state or degree of frozenness of the food, amount of the food, and so on forth. Generally speaking, the cooking profile or parameters should be selected at least partially based on the initial status of food. As an example, different cooking time and/or temperatures may be selected depending on whether the food is frozen. Traditionally, the initial status of food is often judged by the human user and the cooking process is controlled based on the user selection of cooking time, cooking temperature and possibly other parameters. For example, the user may determine the initial status of a food he/she wants to cook according to some visual and/or touch cues, and then select a cooking program by operating buttons, knobs or any other mechanisms on the cooking device. However, human users especially those ordinary consumers are often incapable of accurately and quantitatively determining the initial status of various kinds of foods. As such, the cooking process would suffer from some human errors. In order to achieve more sophisticated control to automatically select the cooking profile, several invasive or non- invasive methods have been proposed to detect the frozen/non-frozen status, for example, by sensing the initial temperature of food. Unfortunately, either invasive or non-invasive methods have disadvantages that limit their applications. For example, the invasive methods usually require contact between the detecting tool and food, which might cause destruction or contamination of the food. Noninvasive methods generally rely on sensing technologies like infrared radiation (IR) which is only able to detect the surface temperature of the food. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether the food is volumetrically, partly or entirely frozen. Moreover, due to the disadvantages such as high cost, inconvenient maintenance, and imprecision under harsh atmosphere (for example, cooking atmosphere), known solutions cannot satisfy the practical requirement of consumer cooking devices while supplying sufficient robustness for the cooking process control. EP 0238022 A2 describes a heating apparatus for cooking cake comprising a gas sensor and weight sensor which are used to determine a total heating time. EP 0001396 Al describes a method of cooking meats in a microwave oven by determining the mean internal temerature of the meat which is indicative of the internal doneness of meat as a function of sensed and sampled time dependent "in situ" humidity and temperature environemtal conditions. US 2013/0092682 Al describes an oven comprising multiple energy sources and a cooking controller that is able to change the cooking parameters based on information received from an oven operator. JP S58 47934 A describes a method of cooking in a high-frequency heater comprising setting a weight loss ratio based on the kind and amount of matter to be cooked, and ending cooking when the actual weight loss ratio reaches the set point. In view of the foregoing, there is a need in the art for a more accurate and cost- effective solution for cooking process control. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In order to address the above and other potential problems, embodiments of the present invention propose a method, apparatus, and computer program product for cooking process control.

Throughout the figures, same or similar reference numbers indicates same or similar elements. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS In general, embodiments of the present invention provide a method, apparatus, and computer program product for cooking process control. One of the core inventive ideas of the present invention is to determine the initial status of food by detecting the weight change of water or any other vaporizable components within the food during a certain period of time. Since the weight change can be measured in various reliable and low-cost manners, embodiments of the present invention provide an accurate and cost-effective manner for determining the initial status of food (for example, frozen/non- frozen, amount of the food, and so forth) and to control the cooking process accordingly. Reference is now made to Fig. 1, where a flowchart of a method 100 for controlling the cooking process in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention is shown. At step S101, weight change of a first vaporizable component in the food is detected over a first period of time. As used herein, the "vaporizable component(s)" refers to any components that may evaporate from the food under a certain condition(s). For example, in some embodiments, the vaporizable component may be water in the food. As known, water will evaporate as the temperature increases, for example, when the food is being heated. Alternatively or additionally, it is possible to detect the weight change of any other suitable vaporizable components in the food such as vaporizable grease and the so on forth. Only for the purpose of illustration, in the following discussions, some exemplary embodiments will be described with reference to the water. However, it should be noted that the scope of the invention is not limited in this regard. In some embodiments, weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food may be detected as a process separate to the cooking process. That is, in such embodiments, weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food and thus the initial status of food are detected before the cooking process starts. In this way, the entire cooking process may be controlled according to the determined initial status of the food, such that the food can be well cooked. Alternatively, in some other embodiments, the detection of weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food as well as the determination of the initial status of food may be done as a portion of the cooking process. More specifically, in such embodiments, the first period over which weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food is detected may be an initial period of cooking time for the cooking process. As an example, initially the user may select a cooking profile or program, for example, randomly or according to personal experience or some visual/touch cues. Then in an initial period (for example, several minutes) of the cooking time, weight change of the first vaporizable component may be detected, such that the initial status of food may be determined to control the remaining cooking process. This would be advantageous in terms of the cooking time since no extra time is need. In some embodiments, in order to facilitate detecting weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food, the food may be placed into an environment with predefined configuration. For example, the food may be placed into an oven or any other suitable cooking device with predefined humidity, temperature, and so on forth. Specifically, in some embodiments, the food may be pre-heated to speed up the evaporation of the first vaporizable component. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, at step S101, weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food may be detected in various manners. For example, assume that during the first period of time, evaporation of the first vaporizable component is the only reason for the weight change of food. Then according to the law of conservation of mass, the weight loss of the food is quantitatively equal to the weight of the first vaporizable component that vaporizes from the food. Accordingly, in some exemplary embodiments, weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food may be detected by measuring weight change of the food per se during the first period of time. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, weight change of the food in the first period of time may be detected in several cost-effective and accurate manners. For example, in some embodiments, the initial weight of the food is measured and recorded. Then the food weight may be sampled over time. The sampling of the food weight may be performed periodically (for example, every one or two minute), for example. Alternatively, the sampling may be performed continuously until sufficient data have been collected to determine the initial status. The sampling of food weight may be done, for example, by use of a weight sensor(s) or electronic balance integrated with the cooking device. Based on the samples of the food weight as well as the initial weight, a set of values for the weight change of the food may be calculated. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, one or more other features related to weight change of the food may be measured. As an example, in some embodiments, elapsed time upon reaching at least one predefined amount of weight change of the food may be measured. As another example, based on the set of values for the weight change of the food, it is possible to establish a thermo-gravimetric (TG) profile that characterizes weight change of the food within the first period of time. For example, the TG profile may be embodied as a curve describing weight change of the food over time, which will be discussed below with reference to Figs. 2A and 2B. In some embodiments, the TG profile may be normalized, de-noised or otherwise processed, for example. Then at least one morphological feature may be extracted from the TG profile depending on the predication model used to identify the initial status. Examples of the morphological features may include, but not limited to, derivatives of any orders, slope, gradient, and so on forth. It should be noted that though detecting weight change of the food is an efficient manner for detecting weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food, the scope of the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, in those embodiments where the first vaporizable component is the water in the food, at step S101, weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food may be detected by detecting the change of an environment parameter(s) during the first period time. Example of such environment parameter includes, but not limited to, humidity. It would be appreciated that in a closed environment like an oven, humidity of the surrounding air will increase as the water of the food evaporates. Thus, by monitoring the change of the environmental humidity, weight change of the water may be derived. Any suitable humidity sensors, no matter currently known or developed in the future, may be utilized to detect the humidity, and the scope of the present invention is not limited in this regard. As another example, at step S101, weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food may be detected by directly measuring the amount of the first vaporizable component that has evaporated from the food during the first period of time. For example, it is known that when the water evaporates into the air, the water molecules will rotate with alternating electromagnetic fields and transform their energy into heat. Accordingly, radio frequency (RF) radiation with suitable frequency may be used to directly detect the amount of evaporated water. Based on the detected amount of evaporated water, weight change of the water in the food may be derived. It should be noted that in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, different technologies for detecting weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food may be used alone. Or, alternatively, two or more of them may be combined in any suitable manners. Moreover, the scope of the present invention is not limited to the examples as discussed above. Rather, any other suitable technologies, whether currently known or developed in the future, may be used to detect or evaluate weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food. Continuing reference to Fig. 1, the method 100 then proceeds to step SI 02 where the initial status of food is determined at least partially based on the detected weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food. As discussed above, the "initial status" refers to the status of food at or near the start of the cooking process. For example, the initial status may include whether the food is frozen or non- frozen, frozen state or degree of the food, amount of the food, and so on forth. As an example, the frozen states may be divided as several levels, each of which is corresponding to a range of food temperatures. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the correlation between weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food (or the weight of the food in some embodiments) and the initial status of food may be established in advance. For example, in some embodiment, it is possible to simply compare the weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food with a predefined threshold(s) and then determine the initial status based on the comparison. As an example, there may be two candidate initial statuses, frozen and non-frozen. If the weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food is higher than the predefined threshold within the first period of time, then the initial status of food may be determined as frozen status. Otherwise, if such weight change is below the threshold, the initial status of food may be determined as non-frozen status. In order to implement more sophisticated control of the cooking process, in some embodiments, the correlation between weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food and the initial status of food may be characterized by a prediction model(s). Generally speaking, the prediction model may be considered as a classifier for identifying the initial status of food based on one or more features related to weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food which may include, for example, one or more features representing the weight change of the food. As discussed above, the required features are collected at step S101 and may include, but not limited to, values for the weight change or its rate of the first vaporizable component in the food at one or more time instants, the time that has elapsed before reaching a pre-determined amount of weight change, or any other features extracted from the TG profile established in training. These features may be used as input to the prediction model at step SI 02 to obtain a predicted initial status of the food. In some exemplary embodiments, the prediction model may predict the initial temperature of the food based on the input one or more features. Then the frozen status and possibly the specific frozen level of the food may be determined based on the predicted temperature. Alternatively, in some embodiments, the prediction model may directly map the extracted feature(s) to an initial status of food. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, any suitable prediction models may be applied to determine the initial status of food. Example of the prediction models include, but not limited to, statistical models such Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network, or any other suitable prediction models. The prediction model may be trained in advance, and in some embodiments, may be refined in use. Specifically, in some embodiments, the predication model may be established and trained with respect to individual types of foods. That is, different prediction models will be used for different types of foods. This would be beneficial to improve the accuracy of the initial status prediction since it is known that the evaporation properties might be different for different types of foods. Accordingly, in some embodiments, determining the initial status of food may comprise obtaining the food type. In some embodiments, the food type may be specified by the user. For example, the user may use mechanisms on the cooking device to select or otherwise specify the food type. Alternatively, the food type may be automatically identified, for example, by means of suitable sensors, machine visions, or pattern recognition technology. As an example, in some embodiments, one or more images of the food may be acquired and analyzed to recognize the shape or other features of the food to thereby determine the food type. In those embodiments where the food type is obtained, the initial status of food may be determined from the prediction model based on the weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food as detected at step SlOl and from the obtained food type. More specifically, a prediction model that is designed for the selected food type may be selected. Then one or more features related to weight change of the first vaporizable component in the food are input to the selected prediction model to determine the initial status. It should be noted that though obtaining and utilizing the food type would be beneficial in some embodiments, this is not necessarily performed. For example, for those special cooking device which is designed to cook similar types of foods, a single prediction model is enough and thus there is no need to obtain the food type. Therefore, in some embodiments, the step of obtaining food type may be omitted. As shown in Fig. 1, at step SI 03, the cooking process is controlled at least partially based on the determined initial status of the food. In general, the cooking profile or one or more parameters thereof for the cooking process may be adjusted according to the determined initial status. For example, the cooking time, temperature, and/or any other relevant parameters or settings may be adapted. In some embodiments, the cooking profile for each initial status of food may be predefined. Only for the purpose of illustration, the following table shows an example. As discussed above, in some embodiments, determination of the initial status may be performed prior to the cooking process. Accordingly, in these embodiments, the cooking process may be controlled, from the very beginning, to utilize the cooking profile corresponding to the determined initial status. Alternatively, the initial status may also be determined within cooking process. That is, the first period of time for the initial status determination is an initial period of the cooking time, such as the first several minutes. In these embodiments, if it is found that the initial cooking profile is not suitable for the determined initial status, then at step SI 03, the cooking profile or its parameter(s) for the remaining cooking process may be adjusted. On the other hand, if the initial cooking profile selected by the user is exactly the one corresponding to the determined initial status, then no adjustment is required for the remaining period of cooking time. In other words, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, control of the cooking process includes making no change to the cooking profile. In addition, in some embodiments, control of the cooking process at step SI 03 may further comprise automatically monitoring doneness or cooking-ready time for the food. To this end, change weight of a second vaporizable component in the food may be detected over a second period of time in the cooking process. In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the second vaporizable component may or may not be the same as the first vaporizable component. For example, in some embodiments, the second vaporizable component may be the water in the food as well, and one or more of the following features may be detected for at least one time instant within the second period of time: moisture loss, rate of moisture loss; change of moisture loss rate, and so on forth. The weight change of the second vaporizable component in the food may be detected in similar manners as discussed above with respect to the first vaporizable component and thus will not be repeated. Based on the detected weight change of the second vaporizable component in the food as well as the initial status as determined at step SI 02, the doneness and cooking- ready time for the food may be determined. For example, for a certain type of food in a given initial status, it may be determined that the food is well-done when the moisture loss reaches a predefined value. Furthermore, in some embodiment, the user is allowed to select the doneness level (for example, light, medium, and well-done) he/she desires. A model may be used to characterize the correlation between each of the possible doneness levels and weight change of the second vaporizable component in the food (or the weight change of the food in some embodiments). Then, based on the detected weight change of the second vaporizable component in the food over the second period of time, the cooking process may be controlled to reach the doneness level desired by the user. Only for the purpose of illustration, an example will now be discussed. In this example, the foods to be cooked include French fries and meat balls. An electronic balance is used for weight measurement and a thermometer is used to measure initial temperature of the foods before frying. The foods are placed into a food basket and at the same time, the initial weight is recorded. As the frying proceeds, the weight of foods is detected and recorded. Conditions in this example are listed below (for both French fries and meat balls): Initial status: frozen, non- frozen Initial weight: 300g, 300g, 500g Frying temperature: 200°C Total frying time: about 20 minutes Fig. 2A shows TG profiles 201 and 202 established for frozen and non- frozen French fries when heated in Air Fryer. Specifically, in Fig. 2A, the curve 201 represents the TG profiles for French fries in frozen states, while the curve 202 represents the TG profiles for French fries in non- frozen states. As described above, a TG profile describes the weight change of the food over time. Likewise, in Fig. 2B, the curve 203 represents the TG profiles established for meat balls in frozen states, while the curve 204 represents the TG profiles for meat balls in non- frozen states. In Figs. 2A and 2B, the vertical axis represents the normalized weight in arbitrary units, and the horizontal axis represents the frying time in seconds. In training, the TG profiles in form of weight change curves are normalized, de-noised and smoothed. It can be seen that the TG profiles are different for foods that are initially frozen and non- frozen. Therefore, the initial status (frozen or non- frozen) may be determined by using the features of the TG profile in combination with the initial weight of the foods. More specifically, in this example, the normalized remaining weight of the food at the 180th seconds of frying (denoted as RW) will be used to determine the initial status. The initial food weight (denoted as M), as an independent predictor variable, is also taken into account. In this example, the prediction model characterizes the correlation between the initial temperature (denoted as T) of foods and the two independent variables, RW and M, as follows: T= a*RW + b*M + c*RW*M + d where a, b, c, and d represent parameters. Through training the prediction model by linear regression based on collected training data, values of the parameters are derived as follows: In detecting the initial status, values of the variables M and RW are detected and input into the prediction model to thereby obtain a predicted initial temperature T. Then categorization of the initial status may be done according to the pre-defined temperature intervals. For example, if the value of T is below or equal to the threshold of 0°C, the initial status of food may be determined as frozen. If the estimated value of T is higher than 0°C, the initial status of food may be determined as non- frozen. Experimental results show that the initial status of foods can be correctly identified. Fig. 3 shows a block diagram of an apparatus for controlling cooking process of a food in accordance with embodiments of the present invention.
