STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH [0002] This invention was made with Government support awarded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health under Grant Number R01DK095168. The United States Government has certain rights in this invention pursuant to this grant. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0003] The present invention relates to compositions comprising a polymeric hydrogel impregnated with a toxin- absorbing or binding nanoparticle. The present invention also relates to the use of the above compositions for decreasing or neutralizing the effect of a toxin, or for treating or preventing an infection by a microbe that produces a toxin, in a subject. Exemplary toxins include biological toxins such as a viral, bacterial, fungal, plant or animal toxin. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0004] Antimicrobial hydrogels have many applications in combating localized microbial threats. Various antimicrobial hydrogel formulations have been applied to facilitate bacterial eradication, promote wound healing, and to prevent implant fouling (la, 2a). These formulations typically consist of highly hydrated biomaterials prepared from natural or synthetic polymers and loaded with common antibiotic drugs (3 a, 4a). Despite extensive development on antimicrobial hydrogels, no formulation has been demonstrated to incorporate the capability to eliminate virulence factors produced from infectious microbes. These virulence factors can promote local inflammations and worsen the clinical outcome of the infections (5 a). [0005] Membrane coated nanoparticles have been demonstrated to detoxify many membrane-damaging bacterial virulence factors (8a, 9a). However, their applications have so far been limited to systemic administrations, as the particle-stabilized lipid membrane structure, an essential feature for toxin absorption, needs to be in a hydrated state for proper functions. Applying the nanoparticles for topical treatment or for device coating are thus challenging as the formulations can dehydrate quickly. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] In one aspect, the present invention provides for a composition comprising a polymeric hydrogel impregnated with a toxin-absorbing or binding nanoparticle, wherein said nanoparticle comprises a) an inner core comprising a non-cellular material, and b) an outer surface comprising a cellular membrane configured for absorbing or binding said toxin. [0007] In another aspect, the present invention provides for a method for decreasing or neutralizing the effect of a toxin, or for treating or preventing an infection by a microbe that produces a toxin, in a subject, which method comprises administering, to a subject in need, or to cells of said subject, an effective amount of the above composition. [0008] In still another aspect, the present invention provides for a method of preserving therapeutic functionality of a toxin-absorbing or binding nanoparticle, which method comprises impregnating a toxin-absorbing or binding nanoparticle in a polymeric hydrogel to form a composition comprising said polymeric hydrogel impregnated with said toxin-absorbing or binding nanoparticle, wherein said nanoparticle comprises a) an inner core comprising a non-cellular material, and b) an outer surface comprising a cellular membrane configured for absorbing or binding said toxin. [0009] In yet another aspect, the present invention provides for use of an effective amount of a composition comprising a polymeric hydrogel impregnated with a toxin- absorbing or binding nanoparticle for the manufacture of a medicament for decreasing or neutralizing the effect of a toxin, or for treating or preventing an infection by a microbe that produces a toxin, in a subject, wherein said nanoparticle comprises a) an inner core comprising a non-cellular material, and b) an outer surface comprising a cellular membrane configured for absorbing or binding said toxin. [00010] As infectious bacteria rely on many virulence factors for survival and colonization (6a, 7a), a toxin-neutralizing antimicrobial hydrogel formulation can be useful in enhancing bactericidal effect via the synergism between antibiotics and anti- virulence treatments. In some embodiments, the present invention incorporates a broadly applicable toxin-neutralizing nanoparticle platform with antimicrobial hydrogels for infection treatment and prophylaxis. In some embodiments, incorporating toxin- neutralizing membrane coated nanoparticles with hydrogels enables the particles to retain their functionality, as hydrogels retain water molecules within its structures (up to 99.6 wt% of water). By combining hydrogel formulations with membrane coated nanoparticles, a toxin detoxifying hydrogel formulation can thus be prepared. Given the cargo loading capacity of hydrogels and polymeric particles, antibiotics can be encapsulated to the toxin-neutralizing hydrogels.

[00013] Figure 2A illustrates a release of nanosponges from hydrogels with different PEG concentrations. Hydrogles with PEG percent higher than 0.6 vol % could reserve about 95% nanosponges after 24 h. Figure 2B illustrates a rheo logical characterization of different hydrogels. For each gel, its G' was higher than its G", suggesting the gelation of both gels. Figure 2C illustrates a SEM image of nanosponge hydrogels. [00014] Figure 3 illustrates absorption of a-toxin by hydrogels with different concentrations of nanosponge. 0.5 ml a-toxin solution (l( g/ml) was added onto 0.5 ml hydrogels with nanosponge concentration of 2, 1 or 0 mg/ml. All tubes with a-toxin and hydrogels were put into a 37°C shaking incubator. 40μ1 supernatants were taken out at different times and the concentration of a-toxin in supernatants was detected using ELISA method. For hydrogels with no nanosponge, only 22% a-toxin diffused into the gel after 24 h, while 46% and 72% a-toxin was absorbed by hydrogels with nanosponge concentration of 1 and 2 mg/ml, respectively.

Exemplary embodiments [000107] In some embodiments, the present invention provides a composition comprising toxin-absorbing nanoparticles and methods of use thereof, for topical treatment of infected areas, as well as antimicrobial coatings on implantable devices. The present invention further provides methods of preserving therapeutic nanoparticle functionalities via hydrogel. [000108] In certain embodiments, the present invention provides that the composition is an antimicrobial hydrogels endowed with toxin-neutralizing capacity via the incorporation of toxinabsorbing nanoparticles, such antimicrobial hydrogels can soak up and/or eliminate the toxins produced by infectious microbes. In certain embodiment, such antimicrobial hydrogels with toxin-absorbing nanoparticles are nanosponges. In other embodiments, the composition of the invention comprises deformable hydrogels which can be used to enable delivery of sustained, local levels of antibiotic to reduce toxin problems for current standard of care, involving bolus dosing. [000109] In some embodiments, the present invention further provides methods of treating infections by administering to a subject in need an effective amount of the inventive composition comprising toxin-absorbing nanoparticles. The administration route includes, but not limited to topical administration at the infected areas. The invention further provides methods of use the inventive composition comprising toxin-absorbing nanoparticles as antimicrobial coatings for prophylactic and/or therapeutic administration on medical devices including, but not limited to, orthopedic implants and catheters. [000110] In some embodiments, the present invention provides antimicrobial hydrogels endowed with toxin-neutralizing capacity via the incorporation of toxin-absorbing nanoparticles. In other embodiments, the present invention further provides that the antimicrobial hydrogels of the invention can be used for topical application in infected areas or for prophylactic administrations on medical devices including orthopedic implants and catheters. Methods of preserving therapeutic nanoparticle functionalities via hydrogel formulations are also provided. [000111] In one embodiment of the invention, it is demonstrated that a poly( ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) hydrogel formulation is embedded with a red blood cell membrane coated nanoparticle platform (Figure 1). By tuning the percentage of PEG in the formulation, dense yet hydrate matrices that retains nanoparticles with varying efficiencies can be prepared (Figure 2a). For instance, a hydrogel formulation containing 0.6 vol % of PEG was shown to retain 95% of the RBC membrane coated nanoparticles by 24 h. Nanoparticle incorporation did not interfere with the hydrogel formation, as gelation was confirmed using rheo logical characterizations (Figure 2b). Scanning electron microscopy visualization also verified the presence of nanoparticles in the hydrogel formulation (Figure 2c). [000112] In another embodiment of the invention, it is demonstrated that by incorporated the RBC membrane coated nanoparticles, the hydrogel formulation is endowed with the ability to absorb a-toxin, a major membrane-damaging toxin secreted by Staphylococcus aureus (Figure 3). Absorption efficiency was found to correlate with the amount of embedded nanoparticles, which indicates that the toxin-absorption capacity of the nanoparticles is persevered in the hydrogel. Hemolysis experiments by mixing RBCs with the toxin-neutralizing hydrogels also demonstrate that the absorbed toxins are completely neutralized (Figure 4a and b). Such toxin neutralization was specific to the hydrogel formulation doped with the RBC membrane coated nanoparticles. The anti-virulence effect of the hydrogel can also be applied to bacteria. Upon mixing the hydrogels with a a-toxin-secreting strain of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the toxin- neutralizing hydrogel was found to greatly inhibit MRSA-induced hemolysis (Figure 5 a and b). Application of the toxin-neutralizing hydrogel was also demonstrated in vivo. Subcutaneous injections of a-toxin mixtures with different hydrogel formulations revealed the beneficial effect of toxin-neutralizing hydrogel. Whereas the normal PEGDMA hydrogel failed to eliminate the necrotizing effect of the a-toxin, the nanoparticle-doped hydrogel completely removed the toxin's virulence effect, leaving the injection site unharmed by the bacterial toxin (Figure 6). Exemplary application [000113] Exemplary applications of the toxin-neutralizing antimicrobial hydrogels include but are not limited to topical administrations to treat local infections and coatings on implantable devices {e.g. , catheters and prosthesis) to prevent infections associated with surgical procedures.

Example Hydrogel Retaining Toxin-Absorbing Nanosponges for Local Treatment of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Infection [000117] Targeting virulence factors such as bacterial toxins represents an attractive antimicrobial approach with potential advantages of expanding the repertoire of bacterial targets, preserving the host endogenous microbiome, and lowering selective pressure for resistance development/1' 2] Among various toxins, pore-forming toxins (PFTs) are the most common class of bacterial protein toxins and constitute important bacterial virulence factors. [3] These toxins disrupt cells by forming pores on cellular membranes and altering their permeability for bioactivity.[4] However, the majority of current toxin targeting strategies, such as antisera,[5] monoclonal antibodies 6' 7] small-molecule inhibitors 8' 9] and molecularly imprinted polymers, [10] relies primarily on structure-specific epitopic binding and custom synthesis is required to match specific toxins. As a result, the enormous diversity of PFTs presents a serious challenge to devise an effective detoxification platform against bacterial infections. To address this challenge, a unique red blood cell (RBC) membrane-coated nanoparticle system has been recently developed by wrapping intact RBC membrane onto polymeric nanoparticle, leading to a broadly applicable toxin-absorbing "nanosponge" for detoxification applications. 12] Different from existing detoxification strategies, the nanosponge targets the membrane-disrupting mechanism common to PFTs; thereby offering an all-purpose toxin decoy strategy to absorb various types of PFTs regardless of their molecular structures. [12] [000118] Meanwhile, on the front of nanotechnology development, therapeutic nanoparticles are increasingly combined with other biomaterials to form hybrid nano structures for improved therapeutic index. Particularly, loading nanoparticles into hydrogels have received much attention.[13] Hydrogels are hydrophilic 3D polymer networks with extensive uses in tissue engineering and drug delivery. With appropriate compositions, hydrogels can not only preserve the structural integrity and the functionalities of the contained nanoparticles but also offer additional engineering flexibility to improve the therapeutic efficacy. For example, biopolymers were linked together by selective adsorption to nanoparticles, forming self-assembled hydrogels with shear-thinning and self-healing properties. [14] Modifying hydrogel composition has also allowed for controllable nanoparticle release and tunable viscoeleasticity suitable for topical applications. [15' 16] Hydrogels made from responsive polymer matrices have also been attempted to load nanoparticles for controlled releases triggered by environmental cues such as pH, ionic strength, and temperature.[17' 18] Recently, polymeric nanoparticles were also loaded into liver lobule-mimicking hydrogel for toxin entrapment. [19] Inspired by the numerous advantages of hydrogels in retaining nanoparticles and enhancing their properties, herein, we report on an advanced hybrid nanoformulation that integrates toxin nanosponge with hydrogel for local treatment of bacterial infection. [000119] Among various bacterial pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a prominent Gram-positive bacterium and the leading cause for a vast range of human skin and wound infections. [20' 21] Over the past a few decades, S. aureus has experienced several waves of antibiotic resistance and now displays broad resistance to the entire beta-lactam class of antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems.[22] To keep up the pace of antibiotic resistance, new antibiotics including vancomycine, linezolid, tedezolid, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and tigecycliine have been developed and introduced in recent years. However, emergence of resistant S. aureus strains, especially toward vancomycin, has significantly increased. [23] Currently, virulent strains of methicillin- resistant S. aureus (MRSA) have become increasingly prevalent, imposing a paramount clinical challenge that threatens public health. [24 26] Collectively, these facts underscore the undisputed and urgent need to develop new and effective therapeutic approaches for MRSA treatment. [000120] Notably, MRSA infections are commonly localized to skin and soft tissues. [27] In these infections, a critical element of virulence results from a diverse arsenal of PFTs secreted by the bacteria, which attack the host cells. [28] These distinctive features of MRSA infections make the nanosponge-hydrogel hybrid formulation an attractive treatment strategy against such infections (Figure 7A). The hydrogel composition can be optimized to effectively retain nanosponges within its matrix without compromising toxin transport for neutralization. In the study, we confirm the in vitro and in vivo toxin neutralization capabilities of the nanosponge-hydrogel formulation. When injected in situ, the hydrogel can effectively retain nanosponges at the injection sites, a property favoring toxin absorption. In a subcutaneous MRSA mouse model, the hybrid formulation shows significant anti- virulence therapeutic efficacy, evidenced by the markedly reduced MRSA skin lesion development. Overall, we demonstrate the potential of the nanosponge-loaded hydrogel as a new and effective detoxification strategy for the treatment of localized MRSA infection. [000121] The preparation of nanosponge-loaded hydrogel (denoted "NS-gel") was divided into two steps. In the first step, we prepared nanosponges by mechanically extruding purified mouse RBC membrane with 100 nm of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) polymeric cores. Membrane coating was confirmed with transmission electron microscope (ΤΕΜ).[11' 29] In the second step, we mixed pre-formed nanosponges with acrylamide as the monomer and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) as the cross-linker. Hydrogelation was initiated by adding ammonium persulfate and tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED), and allowed to proceed for 12 h at room temperature. [16] [000122] The hydrogel composition was optimized for effective nanosponge retention while maintaining a low viscosity suitable for injection. To this end, we first labeled the nanosponges with l ,l '-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3' tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4- chlorobenzenesulfonate salt (DiD) (excitation/emission=644 nm/655 nm), a hydrophobic fluorophore with negligible leakage from PLGA polymer matrix.[11' 30] Then we fixed the concentrations of nanosponges, acrylamide, ammonium persulfate, and TEMED as 2 mg/mL (PLGA content), 40 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL and 1 μΕ/mL, respectively, but varied PEGDMA concentrations and accordingly examined the nanosponge release from the corresponding hydrogels. As shown in Figure 7B, the accumulated release of nanosponge over 24 h decreased abruptly from approximately 53% at 0.5 (w/v)% crosslinker concentration to no more than 5% at 0.6 (w/v)%, suggesting that the latter PEGDMA concentration was adequate in forming a hydrogel for effectively retaining nanosponges. This crosslinker concentration was used to prepare NS-gel for the following studies. [000123] The NS-gel was further characterized with dynamic rheological measurements of the storage modulus (G') and the loss modulus (G") as a function of frequency (Figure 7C). In the study, G' exceeded G" over the entire frequency range, a clear viscoelastic behavior indicating the formation of a hydrogel network.[16] In addition, G' and G" values measured from NS-gel were close to those measured from the empty hydrogel (without nanosponges), suggesting a negligible effect of the loaded nanosponges on the gel's rheological characteristics. We then freeze-dried the NS-gel and observed its structure under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The sample showed characteristic porous sponge-like structures with some irregular lamellar features (Figure 7D). At a higher magnification, nanosponge particles with a diameter of approximately 100 nm embedded within the hydrogel were also observed (Figure 7D, insert). [000124] We then compared the ability of the NS-gel in absorbing a-toxin to that of the empty gel. When a-toxin solution was added to the empty gel of an equal volume, a gradual decrease of toxin concentration was observed within the first 1 h of incubation until it reached approximately 50% of the original concentration (Figure 7E). No further decrease of the toxin concentration was observed with prolonged incubation time, suggesting a slow diffusion process of a-toxin into the hydrogel network until equilibrium was reached. In contrast, when a-toxin solution was incubated with the NS-gel, a sharp decrease of toxin concentration was observed within the first 30 min of incubation. After 1 h, no more than 5% of the initial toxin was left in the solution. Such significantly increased ability of the NS-gel in absorbing a-toxin suggests its potential for detoxification applications. [000125] To test the ability of the NS-gel to neutralize PFTs, we used a hemolytic assay where a-toxin was mixed with the NS-gel and then added to purified mouse RBCs.[12] PBS and the empty gel were tested in parallel as controls. As shown in Figure 8A, NS-gel sample showed a clear supernatant, suggesting the RBCs were undamaged. In contrast, noticeable differences were observed with other samples, which showed significant RBC lysis. The degree of hemolysis was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the released hemoglobin in the supernatant at 540 nm (Figure 8B). The capability of the NS-gel to absorb toxins secreted by MRSA bacteria was further examined by mixing the NS-gel with MRSA culture medium known to contain multiple virulent PFTs.[31' 32] As shown in Figure 8C and D, a similar reduction of RBC hemolysis by the NS-gel was observed as compared to the control groups, demonstrating the NS-gel' s applicability in neutralizing multiple types of RBC membrane-targeted PFTs secreted by the bacteria. [000126] Next, we evaluated the retention of the nanosponges by the hydrogel upon in vivo administration. In the study, we formulated the NS-gel with DiD-labeled nanosponges and injected the NS-gel subcutaneously on the left flank of the mice. As a control, the same amount of nanosponges suspended in PBS was injected to the right flank of the same mice. For both groups, the whole body imaging revealed the confinement of fluorescence at the injection sites within 48 h (Figure 9A). However, a more rapid decay of fluorescence intensity was observed at the site injected with nanosponges suspended in PBS, indicating a faster loss of nanoparticles through diffusion to surrounding tissues. Quantification of the fluorescence intensity showed that nearly 80% of the free nanosponges diffused away from the injection site within 2 h. In contrast, the NS-gel had negligible loss of the nanosponge payloads within the initial 2 h and only lost approximately 20% of the total nanosponge during the 48 h testing period (Figure 9B). This study, together with the previous in vitro nanosponge release results (Figure 7B), clearly demonstrated the prolonged retention of the nanosponges conferred by the hydrogel formulation. These results further indicate that the NS-gel could be a competent formulation for the treatment of local bacterial infection, in which the pathogens reside on a localized area of a tissue. [000127] The ability of the NS-gel to neutralize a-toxin was further examined in vivo by subcutaneous injection of a-toxin (50 μL· at a concentration of 40 μg/mL in PBS) immediately followed by injecting empty gel or NS-gel (100 μί), respectively, beneath the right flank skin of mice. For the mice treated with empty gel, 72 h after the injection obvious skin lesions were induced with demonstrable oedema and inflammation (Figure 10A). Closer examination of the skin tissue showed typical indications of toxin- induced damages, including necrosis, apoptosis and inflammatory infiltrate of neutrophils with dermal oedema (Figure 10B).[12' 33] Moreover, the toxin damaged the underlying muscle tissue, as indicated by interfibril oedema, tears on muscles fibres and a significant number of extravasating neutrophils from the surrounding vasculature (Figure 10C).[12] However, mice treated with NS-gel showed no observable damage on the skin (Figure 10D). The tissue samples showed normal epithelial structures in skin histology (Figure 10E) and intact fibrous structures with no visible infiltrate in muscle histology (Figure 10F). [000128] Finally, we proceeded to examine the in vivo anti-MRSA efficacy of the NS- gel. To establish a subcutaneous MRSA infection model, we injected 1 x 109 CFU MRSA bacteria under the flank skin of each ICR mouse.[33] The infected mice were randomly divided into two groups (n = 9) and then injected at the infection sites with the NS-gel and empty gel, respectively. Herein, to evaluate therapeutic efficacy, we chose to compare MRSA-induced skin lesion size, a common index reflecting the severity of the infection. [33 35] After 24 h, mice in both groups developed visible skin lesions but the size difference was non-significant (Figure 11). At 48 h, the lesion sizes increased in both groups; however, the mice treated with the NS-gel showed a significantly smaller skin lesion when compared to those treated with the empty gel. At 72 h and 96 h, the lesion sizes continued to increase in both groups as the infection continued to progress. The lesion size of the NS-gel treated group remained significantly smaller than that of the group treated with the empty-gel. This superior efficacy observed with the NS-gel demonstrates its potential as a local treatment strategy effective against MRSA infection. [000129] Previously, we reported that RBC-membrane coated nanoparticles (i.e. , nanosponges) were effective in neutralizing PFTs including a-toxin, streptolysin-O, and melittin. J The current study took this platform one important step further by directly demonstrating its effectiveness in treating MRSA infection in a mouse model. This advancement is enabled by the combined advantages of the nanosponges and the hydrogel: while the nanosponges absorbing and diverting PFTs away from the cellular targets, the hydrogel retained nanosponges at the infection sites, promoting localized toxin neutralization for better therapeutic efficacy. The observed anti- virulence efficacy reflects the synergy of such combination. With improved versatility and functionality, such advanced hybrid materials are expected to offer a practical and reliable formulation that facilitates downstream preclinical and clinical tests. [000130] The rapid technological developments in nano techno logy and biomaterials provide a promising potential for engineering advanced materials through hybridization. [36' 37] On one hand, nanoparticle platforms are gaining an increasing attention for broad- spectrum toxin neutralization. [38' 39] For example, we have recently extended the nanosponges to neutralize other chemical and biological molecules that target RBCs such as pathological antibodies driving prevalent autoimmune diseases. [30] Meanwhile, cell membrane coating technology has also been increasingly explored to functionalize various types of nanoparticles, including those made from gold,[40' 41] silica,[42] and gelatin, [43] opening unprecedented capability to harness natural functionalities for innovative therapeutics. On the other hand, the technological advance has also led to the development of hydrogels featuring highly interactive, integrative, and biocompatible characteristics for increasingly advanced drug delivery and tissue engineering applications. [44 46] Integrating hydrogel with nanosponges, or cell membrane coated nanoparticles in general, is anticipated to result in advanced materials that harness the advantages of each building material. We believe that this design strategy will open unique opportunities for a wide range of therapeutic applications. [000131] In summary, we developed an advanced hybrid material that integrates a unique toxin-absorbing nanosponge with hydrogel for anti-virulence treatment of local bacterial infection. The nanosponges were made by wrapping intact RBC membrane onto polymeric nanoparticles made from PLGA, followed by loading into hydrogels. The hydrogel composition was optimized to effectively retain nanosponges within its matrix without compromising toxin transport for neutralization. Following subcutaneous injection to mice, nanosponges were effectively retained at the injection sites. In a MRSA subcutaneous mouse model, mice treated with the nanosponge-hydrogel hybrid showed markedly reduced MRSA skin lesion development. These results collectively indicate that the nanosponge-hydrogel hybrid formulation represents a new and effective detoxification strategy for the treatment of localized bacterial infection. Experimental Section [000132] Preparation of nanosponges. The nanosponge was prepared following previously described methods. 12] Briefly, poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) polymeric nanoparticles with a diameter of about 100 nm were prepared with 0.67 dL/g of carboxy-terminated 50:50 PLGA polymer (LACTEL Absorbable Polymers) through a nanoprecipitation process. Specifically, the PLGA polymer was first dissolved in acetone at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Then 1 mL of the solution was added to 3 mL of deionized water. The mixture was then stirred in open air for 1 h and placed in vacuum for another 3 h. The resulting nanoparticle solution was filtered using an Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter with a molecular weight cutoff of 10 kDa (Millipore). To prepare fluorescently labeled nanosponges, 0.1 wt l ,l '-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'- tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate (DiD; excitation/emission = 644/665 nm; Life Technologies) was added to the polymers prior to PLGA nanoparticle synthesis. RBC membrane coating was then completed by fusing RBC membrane-derived vesicles with PLGA nanoparticles via sonication using an FS30D bath sonicator at a frequency of 42 kHz and a power of 100 W for 2 min. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements on the resulting nanosponges (Malvern ZEN 3600 Zetasizer) showed an average hydrodynamic diameter of about 100 nm and 115 nm before and after the membrane coating process, respectively. The core-shell structure of the nanosponge was confirmed by using transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI 200 kV Sphera microscope). [000133] Preparation of nanosponge-loaded hydrogel (NS-gel). To prepare hydrogel, acrylamide (used as the monomer), poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate (PEGDMA, used as the cross-linker), tetramethylethylene diamine (TEMED), and ammonium persulfate (both used as initiators) were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich. For the empty hydrogel, the final concentrations of acrylamide, ammonium persulfate and TEMED were kept constant at 40 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, and 1 respectively, while PEGDMA concentration was tested in the range of 0 - 1 % w/w. The liquid mixture was vortexed for 1 min and then placed in a vacuum chamber at room temperature for 2 h to allow complete gelation to occur. For NS-gel, nanosponges with a final concentration of 2 mg/mL were mixed the aforementioned chemicals followed by gelation. [000134] To measure nanosponge release rate from the hydrogel, DiD dye-labeled nanosponges were used to prepare NS-gels at different PEGDMA concentrations. Then 0.5 mL NS-gel was submerged into 50 mL PBS. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 24 h and the DiD signal from the supernatant was measured. The rheological analysis was carried out at 37 + 0.1 °C on a strain-controlled AR-G2 rheometer with 22 mm diameter parallel-plate geometry (TA Instruments Inc., New Castle, DE). Oscillatory rheological measurements were performed in the linear viscoelastic regime. The strain was kept at 0.1 % and a dynamic frequency sweep from 0.1 to 10 rad/s was conducted to measure the storage modulus G' and loss modulus G". To study hydrogel morphology, NS-gel was lyophilized and the flakes of the gel were placed on a silicon wafer. The samples were coated with iridium and then examined with scanning electron microscope (SEM). Absorption of a-toxin by NS-gel was examined by incubating 2 mL a-toxin (2 μg/mL) with 0.5 mL NS-gel at 37 °C for 24 h. Empty hydrogel was used as a control group. At 4, 8, and 24 h time points, a-toxin concentration in the supernatants was quantified with ELISA (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). [000135] In vitro a-toxin neutralization study. To evaluate a-toxin neutralization by NS-gel in vitro, a hemolytic assay was conducted. Briefly, 3 \L of a-toxin solution (1 mg/mL) was mixed with 0.5 mL NS-gel, empty hydrogel, and PBS, respectively. Then 1 mL of 5% purified mouse RBCs was added to the top of each sample, followed by incubation at 37°C for 1 h. Then the samples were carefully centrifuged. The extent of RBC lysis was quantified by measuring the absorption of the supernatants at 540 nm. To neutralize toxins in bacterial supernatant, MRSA culture (from an overnight culture of 1 x 109 CFU/mL of MRSA 252) was used to dissolve the chemicals for the hydrogel preparation. All experiments were performed in triplicate. [000136] Live whole-body imaging of mice to study nanosponge retention. Prior to the study, the back of the mice (6 week-old male ICR mice from Charles River Laboratories, n=3) was carefully shaved. Then 50 μL· DiD labeled NS-gel was injected subcutaneously to the left flanks of the mice. As a control, nanosponges suspended in PBS (2 mg/mL, 50 μί) were injected subcutaneously to the right flanks the same mice. At the designated time points (0, 6, 24, and 48 h), mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and imaged with a Xenogen IVIS 200 system. Fluorescence intensities were quantified and normalized across the time points. Heat maps were overlaid on bright field images. [000137] In vivo a-toxin neutralization study. Neutralization of a-toxin by the NS-gel was conducted by subcutaneously injecting 50 μL· of 40 μg/mL of a-toxin solution into the flank region of 6 week-old male ICR mice (Charles River Laboratories, n=3), immediately followed by injecting 100 μL· empty gel or NS-gel into the same region. After 72 h the mice were imaged. Then the mice were sacrificed and the skin and muscle samples were removed. The tissues were frozen, cut, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological analysis. [000138] In vivo detoxification efficacy against localized MRSA infection. To evaluate in vivo detoxification efficacy of the NS-gel against MRSA infection, a MRSA subcutaneous infection mouse model was used. Briefly, prior to the study, the back of 18 ICR mice (6 week-old male, Charles River Laboratories) was carefully shaved. Then 1 x 109 CFU of MRSA 252 suspended in 50 PBS was injected subcutaneously into the flank region. Then the mice were randomly divided into two groups (n=9). For the treatment group, 0.2 mL NS-gel was injected into the infection region. For the control group, the empty gel instead of NS-gel was injected. The lesion of each mouse was carefully monitored. The lesion was photographed and the lesion size was measured from the photography by using Image J. [000139] REFERENCES [1 ] A. E. Clatworthy, E. Pierson, D. T. Hung, Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007, 3, 541.
