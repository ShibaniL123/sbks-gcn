The present invention is related to a conditioning composition for hair comprising optical brightener und ubichinone. The conditioning composition of the present invention can be in the form of a shampoo, cleansing - conditioning composition, or in the form of a conditioner used after washing hair with cleansing compositions. Optical brightener comprising hair conditioning compositions are known in the literature. For example, WO 99/13823 discloses hair conditioning compositions comprising optical brighteners and a hair conditioning agent selected from silicones, cationic compounds, high melting point compounds, perfume compounds and water-soluble high molecular weight oily compounds. There is a need for further improvement in their performance with respect to the brightening and conditioning effect especially keeping healthy appearance of hair for a long time. On the other hand deposition of the optical brighteners onto hair is found to be very weak from up until now known hair cosmetic compositions and consequently either low in effect or very high concentration of the actives are used for achieving the desired effects. Therefore, there is a great need for improvement in the deposition of optical brighteners onto hair to increase their effectiveness. EP 1674070 A1 discloses compositions comprising optical brightener at a low pH range which further comprise at least one hydroxycarboxylic acid and/or dicarboxylic acid in order to increase deposition of optical brightener onto hair. It has been observed that hair conditioning properties of such compositions still need to be improved. The objective of the current invention is to provide conditioning compositions for keratin fibers especially hair for effectively brightening hair and also conditioning hair so that hair looks healthy or healthier with excellent shine, manageability, combability and elasticity. It has surprisingly been found out that a composition comprising at least one optical brightener and at least one ubichinone brightens hair excellently and also improves hair conditions in terms of combability, shine, elasticity and managabilty. Accordingly the first object of the present invention is a conditioning composition for hair characterised in that it comprises at least one optical brightener and at least one ubichinone of the following formula where n is a number between 1 and 10. Another object of the present invention is the use of conditioning composition of above for brightening and conditioning hair. Further object of the present invention is the use of the above composition for conditioning hair wherein the composition is not rinsed off from hair after application - so called leave-in application. Still further object of the present invention is the method of conditioning hair wherein hair is treated with at least one composition as mentioned above and rinsed off from hair after a processing time of 30 sec. to 30 min.

Viscosity of shampoo compositions can be adjusted with known viscosity enhancers. The preferred ones are glyceryl laurate, PEG-55 propyleneglycol oleate and PEG-18 glyceryl oleate/cocoate known with the trade names AntilR 141 and 171, respectively and PEG-160 sorbitan triisostearate known with a trade name RheodolR. It should be noted that in the case that a composition are delivered in the form of a foam from a pump-foamer and/or aerosol can, those compositions should not be thickened and have a viscosity value not more than 500 mPa.s, more preferably 250 mPa.s measured as mentioned above at room temperature. Viscosity of the non-cleansing conditioning composition may not be more than 50,000 mPa.s at 20¬∞C measured with Brookfield Rheometer at a shear rate of 10 sec-1. It should especially be noted that the effects of the inventive compositions become more and more visible after repeated usage. Especially brightening and shine enhancing effects are very much pronounced after repeated usage. The following examples are to illustrate the invention, but not to limit. The compositions according to the invention are prepared by mixing the individual components in water, whereby it is also possible to use pre-mixtures of various ingredients.

Exclusion of Ubichinone resulted in loss of effects. Furthermore, shine was very much reduced when Ubichinoe and optical brightener both excluded from the composition. At the same time in the above composition 0.1 % Basic red 51 was dissolved. Excellent red shine was observed on dark blonde hair. Similar results are observed with the following shampoo compositions.

The foam shampoo so obtained showed excellent cleansing and brightening and shine effects. Additionally, inot the above shampoo 0.05% basic blue 99, and 0.005% basic red 51 was added. Excellent warm silver shine was observed on the washed gray hair. At the same time, excellent anti-yellow effect is observed on the freshly bleached hair.
