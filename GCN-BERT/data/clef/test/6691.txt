CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This is application is the National Stage Entry of PCT/EP2013/071305, filed Oct. 11, 2013, which claims priority to Japanese Application No. 12/262295, filed Nov. 30, 2012, the disclosures of which are incorporate herein by reference in their entireties. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention concerns paint compositions which have excellent staining resistance which can be used ideally in various fields and especially as top-coat paints for the production of coated steel sheet. BACKGROUND The steel sheets which are used for outdoor building materials (for example shutters, rain doors, doors, roofing materials, siding materials and the like), external fittings (for example external air conditioning motors) and the like are such that the surface of the coated steel sheet is readily stained as a result of the effects of rain (acid rain), dust storms and the like and so excellent staining resistance is required. A paint composition with which paint films which not only have staining resistance in a short period of time after coating but with which the staining resistance is maintained over a long period of time is required to provide the coated steel sheets with staining resistance. A paint composition which includes a silicon oxide sol of which the surface has been modified with a silane coupling agent which has a specified average particle diameter has been disclosed in Patent Document 1 as a paint composition which has such staining resistance. With a paint film obtained by coating this paint composition the staining resistance of the paint film is retained for a long period of time but the period of time after coating until staining resistance appears needs to be shortened. Furthermore, a surface controlling agent which provides hydrophilicity which includes a copolymer of unsaturated group-containing carboxylic acid morpholineamide monomer and acrylic acid ester group-containing organosiloxane monomer and a paint composition in which this surface controlling agent is used have been disclosed in Patent Document 2. However, the paint films obtained on coating this paint composition do not retain their staining resistance for a long period of time. Moreover, a paint composition which includes polydimethylsiloxane-based copolymer, which has a polydimethylsiloxane part and a vinyl polymer chain part, and organosilica sol and the like has been disclosed in Patent Document 3. However, the paint films obtained by coating this paint composition are such that the paint film performance required for coated steel sheet, such as water resistance, bending workability and the like are unsatisfactory. SUMMARY Provided is a paint composition with which paint films of which paint film performance required of coated steel sheets such as water resistance, bending workability and the like are satisfactory and which not only provide staining resistance in a short period of time after being coated but with which the excellent staining resistance is maintained over a long period of time can be obtained.

In one or more embodiments, the weight average molecular weight of the radical copolymer (C) is from 1,500 to 15,000, specifically from 2,000 to 12,000 and more specifically from 3,000 to 10,000. In those cases where the weight average molecular weight is less than 1,500 and in those cases where it exceeds 15,000 there are cases where staining resistance is not achieved in a short period of time after coating. The weight average molecular weight is, for example, 1,500, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, 12,000 or 15,000, and it may be within the range between any two of the numerical values shown.

In those cases where the hydroxyl group value is less than 10 mgKOH/g and in those cases where it exceeds 50 mgKOH/g there are cases where staining resistance is not achieved in a short period of time after coating. A paint composition of this invention includes an organosilica sol (D) which has a specified average particle diameter. Organosilica sol signifies a silica sol dispersed in an organic solvent. The organic solvent should be a solvent in which it is possible to disperse a silica sol, and examples include methanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, n-propyl cellosolve, dimethylacetamide, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, toluene, xylene•n-butanol mixed solvent, propylene glycol monomethyl acetate, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate and the like.

In one or more embodiments, the average particle diameter of the organosilica sol (D) which is used in a paint composition of this invention is from 1 to 30 nm, specifically from 5 to 25 nm, and more specifically from 5 to 20 nm. If the average particle diameter exceeds 30 nm there are cases where the bending workability declines. Moreover, the average particle diameter in this specification is the value obtained with the BET method. The organosilica sol (D) which is used in the invention may be one which has been subjected to surface treatment with a silane coupling agent. Examples of the silane coupling agents include vinyltrimethoxysilane, γ-methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, γ-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, γ-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, methyltrimethoxysilane, dimethyldimethoxysilane and the like. These silane coupling agents can be used individually and combinations of two or more types can also be used. In one or more embodiments, the solid fraction mass ratio of the paint composition represented by {aforementioned (C) component/aforementioned (D) component} is from 0.2 to 5.0, specifically from 0.5 to 3.5, and more specifically from 1.5 to 2.5. If the solid fraction mass ratio is less than 0.2 there are cases where staining resistance is not achieved in a short period of time after coating, and if it exceeds 5.0 then there are cases where the staining resistance of the paint film is not retained for a long period of time. In a paint composition of this invention the solid fraction mass ratio represented by {aforementioned (C) component+aforementioned (D) component}/{aforementioned (A) component+aforementioned (B) component} is from 3 to 30%, specifically from 7.5 to 20%, and more specifically from 7.5 to 17% and most specifically from 7.5 to 12%. If the sum of the solid fraction masses of the radical copolymer (C) and the organosilica sol (D) is less than 1% there are cases where adequate staining resistance cannot be imparted to a coated steel sheet, and if it exceeds 30% there are cases where the water resistance is reduced. In addition to the abovementioned components, the various known components which are generally used in the paint field can be included, as required, in a paint composition of this invention. In more practical terms examples include various surface controlling agents such as leveling agents, anti-foaming agents and the like, various additives such as dispersing agents, settling inhibitors, ultraviolet absorbers, light stabilizers, scratch inhibitors and the like, various pigments such as coloring pigments, true pigments and the like, glitter materials, curing catalysts, organic solvents and the like. In one or more embodiments, a paint composition of this invention may be an organic solvent type paint or an aqueous paint, and, in one or more specific embodiments, it is an organic solvent type paint. The organic solvents include one type, or a mixture of two or more types, of, for example, the ester-based solvents such as n-butyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, n-pentyl acetate, 3-methoxybutyl acetate and the like, the ketone-based solvents such as methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexanone, isophorone and the like, the aromatic solvents such as Solvesso 100, Solvesso 150 (trade names, produced by the Exxon Mobil Chemical Co.) and the like, and the alcohol-based solvents such as butanol, butyl cellosolve and the like. In the production of a coated steel sheet generally an undercoat paint film is formed on the object which is to be painted and a top-coat paint is coated over the undercoat paint film. The formation of the undercoat paint film can impart various aspects of performance such as corrosion resistance and the like to the coated steel sheet. The use of the paint compositions of this invention is not subject to any particular limitation but they are used ideally as top-coat paints in the production of coated steel sheets. Examples of the objects for painting which are coated with a paint composition of this invention are those where treatment with a chromium-free or chromate-based chemical forming agent or the like has been carried out on various types of zinc plated steel sheet such as molten-zinc plated steel sheet, electro-zinc plated steel sheet, alloying zinc plated steel sheet, aluminum-zinc plated steel sheet, nickel-zinc plated steel sheet, magnesium-aluminum-zinc plated steel sheet, magnesium-aluminum-silica-zinc plated steel sheet and the like, stainless steel sheet, aluminum sheet and the like. In one or more embodiments, for the chemical forming treatment, a chromium-free type chemical forming treatment agent issued. In those cases where a paint composition of this invention is used as a top-coat paint in the production of coated steel sheet the undercoat paint may be, for example, a polyester-based paint, epoxy resin-based paint or the like, and it may include either a chromium based or a chromium-free anti-rust pigment. The methods which are generally used for the production of coated steel sheet, for example roll-coater coating, curtain-flow coater coating and the like, can be used for the method of coating a paint composition of this invention. The general coating conditions for the production of coated steel sheet can be used as the coating conditions for a paint composition of this invention. The paint film thickness of a top-coat paint in the production of coated steel sheet is, for example, from 10 to 25 μm, and the heating and curing conditions of the top-coat paint film are, for example, a highest sheet temperature attained of from 190 to 250° C. and a curing time of from 20 to 180 seconds. Moreover, one or more mid-coat paint films may be formed between the undercoat paint film and the top-coat paint film in accordance with the performance required of the coated steel sheet. Examples The invention is described in more detail below by means of illustrative examples, but the invention is not limited by these illustrative examples.

Example 1 Production of a Paint Composition The hydroxyl group-containing polyester resin A-1 (39.9 parts by mass), 34.2 parts by mass of titanium dioxide (trade name TiPure R960, produced by the DuPont Co.) and 10.0 parts by mass of mixed solvent (aromatic solvent (trade name Solvesso 100, produced by the Exxon Mobil Chemical Co.)/cyclohexanone=50/50 (ratio by mass)) were mixed together and dispersed in a sand mill until the pigment particle size reached 10 μm and a mill-base was obtained. Next 17.4 parts by mass of melamine resin B-1 (trade name Melan 2040, produced by the Hitachi Kasei Kogyo Co., imino group-containing butylated melamine resin, resin solid fraction 59 mass %), 5.1 parts of the radical copolymer C-1 and 3.4 parts by mass of organosilica sol D-1 (trade name MIBK-SD, produced by the Nissan Kagaku Kogyo Co., average particle diameter 10 to 15 nm, solid fraction 30 mass %) were mixed with this mill-base and the paint composition of Example 1 was obtained. Examples 2 to 13 and Comparative Examples 1 to 14 Production of Paint Compositions The paint compositions of Examples 2 to 13 and Comparative Examples 1 to 14 were produced with the same method as in Example 1 in accordance with the compounding compositions shown in Tables 3 and 4. Test pieces where the various paint compositions of the examples and comparative examples had been used as top-coat paints were produced with the method outlined below, a performance evaluation of the paint films was carried out and the results are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Moreover, the paint compositions were submitted for painting after being diluted with the mixed solvent in such a way that the viscosity was 120 seconds (Ford Cup No. 4, 25° C.). Test Piece Preparation An epoxy resin-based undercoat paint (trade name Precolor Primer HP-301, produced by the BASF Coatings Japan Co. Ltd.) was coated with a bar coater onto an aluminum/zinc alloy plated steel sheet (AL 55%) of thickness 0.35 mm, which had been subjected to a chemical forming treatment, in such a way as to provide a dry film thickness of 5 μm and baked in a hot draught drier for 40 seconds where the highest temperature reached by the sheet was 210° C. and an undercoat paint film was formed. A paint composition of an example or comparative example was coated over the undercoat paint film with a bar coater in such a way as to provide a dry film thickness of 15 μm and baked in a hot draught drier for 40 seconds where the highest temperature reached by the sheet was 220° C., a top-coat paint film was formed and a test piece was obtained. Paint film performance evaluations as indicated below were carried out with the test pieces obtained and the results are shown in Tables 3 and 4. Rain Streak Staining Resistance Test pieces (100 mm×200 mm×0.3 mm) were fitted in such a way that the coated surface was facing north on a standing platform modeling a house frontage at the Totsuka Works of the BASF Coatings Japan Co. Ltd. and exposure tests were carried out and a test piece which had been subjected to a 3 month exposure test and a test piece which had been subjected to a 6 month exposure test were obtained. The state of the paint film on each test piece was observed visually and evaluated on the basis of the following criteria: : No trace of rain streaks could be seen. ◯: Slight traces of rain streaks could be seen. X: Traces of rain streaks could be seen. Bending Workability The test piece was bent through 180° in such a way that sheets similar to the test piece were inserted to produce a bending workability test piece. At this time the number of sheets within the test piece is indicated by 0T, 2T and the like. For examples, 0T indicates that the test piece was bent with no sheet similar to the test piece inserted, and 2T indicates that the test piece was bent in such a way that two sheets similar to the test piece were inserted. In the performance evaluation of this invention 4T tests were carried out and cellophane tape was firmly stuck over the apex part after bending, the tape was peeled away in one go with the end of the tape at an angle of 45° and an assessment was made on the basis of the following criteria depending on the state of peeling of the paint film. : No peeling of the paint film was observed. ◯: Slight peeling of the paint film was observed. X: Peeling of the paint film was observed. Water Resistance A 4T bending operation was carried out with a test piece after it had been immersed in boiling water for 2 hours and left to cool for 2 hours at room temperature. Cellophane tape was firmly stuck over the apex part after bending, the tape was peeled away in one go with the end of the tape at an angle of 45° and an assessment was made on the basis of the following criteria depending on the state of peeling of the paint film. : No peeling of the paint film was observed. ◯: Slight peeling of the paint film was observed. X: Peeling of the paint film was observed.
