FIELD OF INVENTION The invention relates to an environmentally friendly brass alloy, and particularly to a free cutting and dezincification resistant brass alloy. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Generally, the brass for processing is added with metallic zinc by a percentage of 38-42%. In order to make it easy to process brass, brass usually contains 2-3% lead to enhance strength and processability. Lead-containing brass has excellent moldability (making it easy to fabricate products of various shapes), cutting performance, and abrasion resistance, so that it is widely applied to mechanical part with various shapes, accounts for a large proportion in the copper industry, and is well known as one of the most important basic material in the world. However, during the production or use of lead-containing brass, lead tends to dissolve in the solid or gas state. Medical studies have shown that lead can bring about substantial damage to the human hematopoietic and nervous systems, especially children's kidneys and other organs. Many countries in the world take the pollution and hazard caused by lead very seriously. The National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) sets a tolerance of lead element of 0.25% or less. Organizations like the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) of European Union successively stipulate, restrict and prohibit the usage of brass with a high lead content. Furthermore, when the zinc content in brass exceeds 20 wt%, the corrosion phenomenon of dezincification is prone to occur. Especially when brass is exposed to the chloride rich environment, e.g. marine environment, the occurrence of corrosion phenomenon of dezincification may be accelerated. Dezincification may severely destroy the structure of brass alloy, so that the surface strength of brass products is reduced and the brass tube even perforates. This greatly reduces the lifetime of brass products and causes problems in application. Therefore, there is a need to provide an alloy formula for solving the above problems, which can replace the brass with a high lead content, is dezincification corrosion resistant, and further has excellent casting performance, forgeability, cutting performance, corrosion resistance and mechanical properties. SUMMARY OF INVENTION As known in the prior art, silicon may appear in the alloy metallographic structure as γ phase (sometimes as κphase). In this case, silicon may replace the function of lead in the alloy to an extent, and improve cutting performance of the alloy. Cutting performance of the alloy increases with the content of silicon. However, silicon has a high melting point and a low specific gravity and is prone to be oxidized. As a result, after silicon monomer is added into the furnace in the alloy melting process, silicon floats on the surface of alloy. When the alloy is melt, silicon will be oxidized into silicon oxides or other oxides, making it difficult to produce silicon-containing copper alloy. In case silicon is added in the form of Cu-Si alloy, the economic cost is increased. Bismuth can be added to replace lead for forming cutting breakpoints in the alloy structure to improve cutting performance. However, thermal cracking is prone to occur during forging in case of a high bismuth content, which is not conducive for producing. Thus, it is an object of the invention to provide a brass alloy which exhibits excellent performance like tensile strength, elongation rate, dezincification resistance and cutting performance, which is suitable for cutting processed products that require high strength and wear resistance, and which is suitable for constituent materials for forged products and cast products. The brass alloy of the invention can securely replace the alloy copper with a high lead content, and can completely meet the demands about restrictions on lead-containing products in the development of human society. To achieve the above object, the inventors have proposed the following lead-free bismuth-free silicon-free brass alloy. A lead-free bismuth-free silicon-free brass alloy with excellent cutting performance (hereinafter referred to as the inventive product 1) comprises: by the total weight of the brass alloy, 60-65 wt% copper, 0.01-0.15 wt% antimony and 0.1-0.5 wt% magnesium, and a balance of zinc. In the inventive product 1, lead, silicon, and bismuth is absent, the content of copper is controlled at 60-65 wt%, and a small quantity of antimony and magnesium is added to form intermetallic compounds with copper, so that cutting performance of the alloy is improved and dezincification resistance of the alloy is simultaneously improved. In other words, in the inventive product 1, the cutting performance is improved by adding antimony and magnesium to form γ phase. The metallographic structure of the alloy mainly comprises α phase, β phase, γ phase, and soft and brittle intermetallic compounds which are distributed in grain boundaries or grains. Copper and zinc make main constituents of the brass alloy. By adding antimony and magnesium, not only the cutting performance of the alloy is improved, but also the dezincification resistance is improved. When the content of antimony is lower than 0.01 wt%, and the content of magnesium is lower than 0.1 wt%, the resulting alloy has a cutting performance which is not acceptable in the industrial production. The cutting performance of the alloy will increase with the content of antimony and magnesium. However, when the content antimony in the alloy is 0.15 wt% and the content of magnesium is 0.5 wt%, improvement in the cutting performance of the alloy reaches the saturated state. A lead-free bismuth-free silicon-free brass alloy with excellent cutting performance (hereinafter referred to as the inventive product 2) comprises: by the total weight of the brass alloy, 60-65 wt% copper, 0.01-0.15 wt% antimony, 0.1-0.5 wt% magnesium, and further comprises, by the total weight of the brass alloy, 0.05-0.3 wt% phosphorus and/or 0.05-0.5 wt% manganese, and a balance of zinc. As compared with the inventive product 1, the inventive product 2 is further added with 0.05-0.3 wt% phosphorus and/or 0.05-0.5 wt% manganese by the total weight of the brass alloy. Although phosphorus can't form γ phase, phosphorus has a function of facilitating a good distribution of γ phase for antimony and magnesium, thus increasing cutting performance of the alloy. Meanwhile, in case phosphorus is added, γ phase will disperse crystal grains of the primary α phase, thus increasing casting performance and corrosion resistance of the alloy. When the content of copper, antimony, and magnesium is 60-65 wt%, 0.01-0.15 wt%, and 0.1-0.5 wt%, respectively, and the content of phosphorus is lower than 0.05 wt%, phosphorus can not play its role effectively. While when the content of phosphorus is higher than 0.3 wt%, casting performance and corrosion resistance of the alloy will be degraded. Adding manganese helps to improve dezincification resistance and cast flowability of the alloy. When the content of manganese is lower than 0.05 wt%, manganese can not play its role effectively. While when the content of manganese is 0.5 wt%, manganese can play its role to the saturation value. A lead-free bismuth-free silicon-free brass alloy with excellent cutting performance (hereinafter referred to as the inventive product 3) comprises: by the total weight of the brass alloy, 60-65 wt% copper, 0.01-0.15 wt% antimony, 0.1-0.5 wt% magnesium, and further comprises, by the total weight of the brass alloy, 0.05-0.5 wt% manganese, 0.1-0.7 wt% aluminum, 0.05-0.5 wt% tin, 0.05-0.3 wt% phosphorus and/or 0.001-0.01 wt% boron, and a balance of zinc. As compared with the inventive product 1, the inventive product 3 is further added with 0.05-0.5 wt% manganese, 0.1-0.7 wt% aluminum, 0.05-0.5 wt% tin, 0.05-0.3 wt% phosphorus and/or 0.001-0.01 wt% boron by the total weight of the brass alloy. Adding tin into the alloy also intends to form γ phase, thus increasing cutting performance of the alloy. Besides, adding tin obviously increases strength, plasticity, and corrosion resistance the alloy. However, since adding tin may increase cost, aluminum is added along with tin. As a result, not only cutting performance of the alloy can be improved, but also strength, wear resistance, cast flowability, and high temperature oxidation resistance of the alloy can be increased. In order to make a better use of the above effects, the content of tin and aluminum is 0.05-0.5 wt% and 0.1-0.7 wt%, respectively. Meanwhile, the alloy is further added with trace boron so as to increase corrosion resistance of the alloy. By adding boron, it is possible to better suppress alloy dezincification, increase the mechanical strength, and simultaneously alter defect structure of cuprous oxide film on the surface of copper alloy, thus forming a cuprous oxide film which is more uniform, dense, and stain resistant. When the content of boron is lower than 0.001 wt%, boron can't play its role as mentioned above. While when the content of boron is higher than 0.01 wt%, the above performance can't be further increased. Thus, the optimum content of boron is 0.001-0.01 wt%. The content of phosphorus and manganese has the same interval as that of the inventive product 2, and this is based on the same reason as that of the inventive product 2. Whether antimony, magnesium, aluminum, tin, phosphorus, manganese and/or boron should be added depends on the requirement for cutting performance of various products.

In case that neither antimony nor magnesium is present, adding 0.05-0.5 wt% tin of the total weight of the alloy can still meet the needs for cutting performance in the industrial production. The content of tin to be added has the same interval as that of the inventive product 3, and this is based on the same reason as that of the inventive product 3.

As a result, the brass alloy is suitable for replacing the existing lead-containing brass alloy and for producing parts like faucet and sanitary ware. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a flow chart illustrating a method for fabricating an example of the inventive product 3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The technical solutions of the invention will be described expressly by referring to embodiments thereof. It is not intended to limit the scope of the invention to the described exemplary embodiments. The modifications and alterations to features of the invention as described herein, as well as other applications of the concept of the invention (which will occur to the skilled in the art, upon reading the present disclosure) still fall within the scope of the invention. In the invention, the wording "or more", "or less" in the expression for describing values indicates that the expression comprises the relevant values. The dezincification corrosion resistant performance measurement, as used herein, is performed according to AS-2345-2006 specification in the cast state, in which 12.8 g copper chloride is added into 1000C.C deionized water, and the object to be measured is placed in the resulting solution for 24 hr to measure a dezincification depth. ⊚ indicates a dezincification depth of less than 100 µm; ○ indicates a dezincification depth between 100 µm and 200 µm; and indicates a dezincification depth larger than 200 µm. The cutting performance measurement, as used herein, is performed in the cast state, in which the same cutting tool is adopted with the same cutting speed and feed amount. The cutting speed is 25 m/min (meter per minute), the feed amount is 0.2 mm/r (millimeter per number of cutting edge), the cutting depth is 0.5 mm, the measurement rod has a diameter of 20 mm, and C36000 alloy is taken as a reference. The relative cutting rate is derived by measuring the cutting resistance. The relative cutting rate = cutting resistance of C36000 alloy/cutting resistance of the sample. ⊚ indicates a relative cutting rate larger than 85%; and ○ indicates a relative cutting rate larger than 70%. Both the tensile strength measurement and the elongation rate measurement, as used herein, are performed in the cast state at room temperature as an elongation measurement. The elongation rate refers to a ratio between the total deformation of gauge section after elongation ΔL and the initial gauge length L of the sample in percentage: δ=ΔL/L×100%. The reference sample is a lead-containing brass with the same state and specification, i.e., C36000 alloy. According to measurement, the proportions for constituents of C36000 alloyare listed as follow, in the unit of weight percentage (wt%): Material No.copper (Cu)zinc (Zn)bismuth (Bi)antimony (Sb)manganese (Mn)aluminum (Al)tin (Sn)lead (Pb)iron (Fe)C36000 alloy60.5336.2600000.122.970.12 Fig. 1 is a flow chart illustrating a method for fabricating an example of the inventive product 3, which comprises the steps of: Step S100: providing copper and manganese. In this step, a copper-manganese alloy can be provided as the precursor of copper and manganese elements.Step S102: heating the copper-manganese precursor alloy to 1000-1050 °C to form a copper-manganese alloy melt. In this step, the copper-manganese alloy can be added into the high-frequency melting furnace, and heated to melt in the melting furnace. The temperature can be elevated to 1000-1050 °C, and even up to 1100 °C, for 5-10 minutes, so that the copper-manganese alloy is melt into a copper-manganese alloy melt. With these actions, it is possible to prevent the melt copper manganese from absorbing a lot of external gases (due to a too high temperature), which may otherwise result in cracking in the molded alloy.Step S104: decreasing the temperature of the copper-manganese alloy melt to 950-1000 °C. In this step, when the temperature in the melting furnace is elevated to 1000-1050 °C for a duration of 5-10 minutes, the power supply of the high-frequency melting furnace is turned off, so that the temperature in the melting furnace is reduced to 950-1000 °C, while the copper-manganese alloy melt is maintained in the melt state.Step S106: covering the surface of copper-manganese alloy melt with a glass slagging agent. In this step, the surface of copper-manganese alloy melt is covered with the glass slagging agent at 950-1000 °C. This step can effectively prevent the melt from contacting the air, and prevent zinc to be added in the next step from boiling and evaporating due to melting at a high temperature of 950-1000 °C.Step S108: adding zinc to the copper-manganese alloy melt to form a copper-manganese-zinc melt. In this step, zinc is added to the melting furnace, and is immersed into the copper-manganese alloy melt, so that zinc is sufficiently melt in the copper-manganese alloy melt to form a copper-manganese-zinc melt.Step S110: deslagging the copper-manganese-zinc melt. In this step, the copper-manganese-zinc melt can be stirred and mixed under the action high-frequency induction, and then the slagging agent can be removed. Then, the copper-manganese-zinc melt is deslagged with a deslagging agent.Step S112: adding antimony, aluminum, tin, and magnesium to the copper-manganese-zinc melt to form a metal melt. In this step, copper antimony precursor alloy, copper aluminum precursor alloy, copper tin precursor alloy, and copper magnesium alloy can be added to the copper-manganese-zinc melt.Step S114: elevating the temperature of the metal melt to 1000-1050 °C, and adding copper boron alloy and phosphorus copper alloy to form a lead-free bismuth-free silicon-free brass alloy melt.Step S116: discharging the brass alloy melt for casting to form the brass alloy. In this step, the brass alloy melt is stirred evenly, the discharging temperature is controlled at 1000-1050 °C, and finally the brass alloy melt is discharged to casting a lead-free bismuth-free silicon-free brass alloy which exhibits good processability, dezincification resistance, and mechanical performance.
