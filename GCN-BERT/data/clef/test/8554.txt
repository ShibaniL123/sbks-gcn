FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to processes for the synthesis of buprenorphine and derivatives of buprenorphine. In particular, the present invention provides processes for the formation of these opiate compounds that minimizes the formation of impurities. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Buprenorphine hydrochloride and products containing it are effective treatments of opiate addiction. Methods of synthesizing buprenorphine have been known from the late 1960s. For instance, buprenorphine may be synthesized by an alkylation reaction from norbuprenorphine utilizing bromomethylcyclopropane. The bromomethylcyclopropane typically contains an alkenyl impurity which can also participate in the alkylation reaction. This leads to the formation of Impurity A, otherwise known as (2S)-2-[17-(but-3-enyl)-4,5α-epoxy-3-hydroxy-6-methoxy-6α,14-ethano-14α-morphinan-7α-yl]-3,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol. Impurity A is difficult to remove from the final buprenorphine product by known purification techniques, resulting in products with higher impurities than acceptable by the currently prescribed guidelines established by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP). In addition, the typical synthesis uses preparatory chromatography to purify the crude buprenorphine product, which can be costly and labor intensive. Consequently, there is a need in the art for an efficient process for producing buprenorphine with impurity levels that meet or exceed the ICH requirements. WO2007/081506 is directed to a method for the synthesis of norbuprenorphine, and ultimately buprenorphine, utilizing oripavine as the starting material.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a process for producing buprenorphine and derivatives of buprenorphine, such as a compound of Formula (II), that results in less than or equal to 0.15% of any related single individual impurity. In particular, it has been discovered that alkylating norbuprenorphine, or derivatives of norbuprenorphine, such as a compound of Formula (I), at a temperature below 60°C in the presence of a catalytic additive results in a compound of Formula (II) that comprises less than 0.15% by weight of Impurity A.

In certain embodiments, the mixture may be cooled to about 20°C to about 30°C, and then filtered. The reactor and the solid may then be washed, for instance, with water or acetonitrile. This filtered product may then be recrystallized to reduce impurities. The recrystallization process generally comprises dissolving the filtered product in a recrystallization solvent. Suitable recrystallization solvents may include acetonitrile alone or in combination with an alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol. In an exemplary embodiment, the recrystallization solvent is acetonitrile. The solution may be heated to aid in the dissolution of the filtered product.

In still other embodiments, the solution may be heated to about 75°C to about 80°C. In certain embodiments, the solution may be clarified. Generally speaking, if the solution is clarified, the filtration set up should be rinsed with warm solvent to recover any remaining product. After the product is dissolved in the recrystallization solvent, the solution is distilled to remove an amount of the solvent. For instance, in some embodiments, the solution is distilled to remove about 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, or 75% of the solvent. In other embodiments, the solution is distilled to remove about 60% to about 70% of the solvent. In an exemplary embodiment, about 68% of the solvent is removed. After distillation, the solution is cooled to less than about 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, or 4°C and stirred for about 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, or 45 minutes.

EXAMPLES The following examples illustrate various iterations of the invention. Example 1: Alkylation of buprenorphine in Acetone Table 1A below lists the reactants for the alkylation reaction.

Then 3.39g of bromomethylcyclopropane (d 1.392) is measured out into a stoppered container and washed into the reaction flask with the remaining 5mL of acetone. The mixture is refluxed under nitrogen for 6-8 hours. If TLC indicates incomplete reaction, it is refluxed 2 hours further, then cooled to room temperature. To the stirred reaction mixture 160mL of water is added dropwise during 15-40 minutes. The mixture is heated to 55-58°C. It is stirred at that temperature for 20 minutes and then allowed to cool to 20-30°C. The mixture is filtered. The reactor and solid is washed with water (2x30ml, about 4ml per g of starting norbuprenorphine in each wash). The vacuum is turned off and 30mL of acetonitrile is poured onto the solid and allowed to stand there for a minute. Vacuum is applied to the funnel again and air is allowed to draw through for five minutes. The sample is dried to a constant weight. The yield is 90%, with a range of 89-91% in lab examples. With this method of isolation, the crude product has been over 93%w/w purity. It is then recrystallized to remove any remaining impurities. The crude product, air dried, may be carried on to the Example 4 step without drying, as long as the loss on drying is calculated and is used for the Example 4 procedure. Crude products had these purities when cyclopropylmethyl bromide(CPM-Br) with sufficient purity (three purities shown) was used: Table 1 B: Alkylation Results in AcetoneSample #Buprenorphine w/w%Norbuprenorphine w/w%Level of 4- bromo-1-buteneImpurity A w/w%2*74.150.700.33%0.17381.530.080.14%0.03496.000.420.07%0.017* = For comparative purposes only Further examples were run with the lot of cyclopropylmethylbromide containing 0.07% 4-bromo-1-butene: Table 1C: Further Alkylation Examples in AcetoneSample #Buprenorphine AssayImpurity ACrude yield599.46%0.04%90.5%699.65%0.05%89.0%796.82%0.03%89.5%893.51%0.014%89.8%997.08%0.010%89.7%10101.13%0.009%88.5%1196.09%0.02%91.0% In another example, using extraction, is as follows: a mixture of 4.04g of norbuprenorphine, 2.14g of KHCO3, 2,24g of Kl, 1.2mL of bromomethylcyclopropane and 60mL of acetone was refluxed for 6.5h and then stirred overnight. To the mixture was added 80mL of water to give a precipitate. Acetone was distilled out to a head temperature of 70°C. The pot was cooled to room temperature and 80mL dichloromethane was added with stirring. Layers were separated. The water was extracted with 10mL dichloromethane. To the combined dichloromethane extracts in a clean flask was added 55mL of acetonitrile. The mixture was distilled to a head temperature of 74°C, collecting 80mL. At this point some solid was seen. The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and filtered. The flask and solid were washed with 5mL acetonitrile. The solid was dried in vacuo to 3.19g (70-71%). HPLC analysis indicated 99.2% buprenorphine, 0.05% Impurity A and 0.39% norbuprenorphine. The mother liquor in acetonitrile had 4% norbuprenorphine and 60% buprenorphine. This material would need to be recrystallized once more by the Example 4 method to give passing material with all impurities under 0.15%. Example 2: Alkylation of buprenorphine in DMF This example shows the best product obtained from a reaction in DMF, which was of similar purity to Example 1 above. The cyclopropylmethyl bromide was the same in both Example 1 and this example (0.07% impurity). Complete reaction was only obtained at 85°C. Reagents are shown in Table 2A below.

At this point the solids were mixed and partially dissolved. The cyclopropylmethyl bromide, 1.6mL, was added (d 1.392). The mixture was taken to 85°C and kept there for 5.5 hours. It was allowed to cool and poured slowly into a separate flask, mechanically stirred, with 75mL water. Some of the product may be slightly gummy solid, especially on the stirrer blade. The reaction flask was rinsed with 1mL DMF twice into the same. The solid obtained was filtered and washed with 50mL water. [In some other trials, dried material after this wash can be taken directly to the hydrochloride, if it appears to be a good solid]. This batch was scooped back to the same flask and boiled with 75mL of water briefly, then allowed to stir and cool, to remove some residual DMF. Filtration gave a brown solid, 5.42g (94% yield) after drying in vacuo. Area % purity was 89.5%, Impurity A was 0.16% and norbuprenorphine 0.48%. The material was not recrystallized. There are further examples of the reaction in DMF with varying levels of the butenyl impurity resulting in a variable amount of Impurity A. These are shown in the table below.

The different lots had varying levels of the alkenyl impurity 4-bromo-1-butene. The impurity in the CPMB alkylates in a side reaction and results in varying levels of Impurity A in the buprenorphine, as shown in the reaction scheme below: Experimental data showed that the amount of Impurity A produced is statistically related to the level of the butenyl impurity in the alkylating agent (e.g. CPMB). Lower levels of the butenyl impurity result in lower Impurity A levels, as the data in Table 3 shows. In particular, when Lot 26 was used, and comprised a butenyl impurity level of 0.14%, the acetone alkylations yielded Impurity A levels of between 0.05 and 0.06%. In contrast, using the same lot, but running the alkylation in DMF, yielded the higher Impurity A level of 0.12%.

This relatively clean crude product allows for recrystallization of the crude solid and therefore avoids the need for chromatographic separations. Avoiding a chromatographic separation reduces both manufacturing costs and time. Recrystallization involves the dissolution of buprenorphine in acetonitrile followed by distillation to optimize the recovery. The recovery after recrystallization is typically 90-92%. The recrystallization of the crude buprenorphine can remove 17-20% of Impurity A. If a second recrystallization is performed, the level of Impurity A can be reduced by another 6%. In addition, Impurity E may be removed by recrystallization. One example of a recrystallization of a crude buprenorphine base that had a Impurity A level of 0.02% is as follows. The base (45.05 g) is added to 1295 mL of Acetonitrile charged to a 2-L jacketed reactor with a mechanical stirrer and a condenser. The mixture is heated to 75-80 °C to dissolve the solids. Clarification may be required. If so, a rinse of warm acetonitrile is also required to recover the buprenorphine in the filtration set up. The solution is then set up for distillation to remove 60 - 70% of the solvent used with a target of 68% desired for optimal recovery. For this example 890 mL was distilled from the batch. The batch is then cooled to <10 °C and stirred for 30 minutes. The batch is filtered and washed with 75 mL Acetonitrile (cold). The sample is dried to a constant weight. The yield is 94%, with a range of 90 - 94% in lab examples. The weight assay of Buprenorphine is 99.77% with Impurity A at 0.014%. The sum of all other impurities is 0.37 by area percent. The results are in Table 4A below. Table 4A.

The synthesis results in the formation of 2 side products, shown in the reaction scheme below: The bromocyclobutane side product is unreactive, while the 4-bromo-1-butene side product should be below 0.5% for use in the alkylations described above. If the CPMB is not pure enough (generally less than 0.5% of the butenyl impurity) the CPMB can be purified. CPMB and the butenyl impurity have a narrow boiling point range, hence fractional distillation was used to separate the two. The distillation system utilized a >5 plate Oldershaw distillation column with a controlled splitter apparatus. The distillation is performed under reduced pressure and low temperature in a batch process. The recovery is typically 45 - 64%, operated at 39 - 40°C and 47 - 52 millibar. The butenyl bromide is distilled forward and the CPMB with increased purity remains in the distillation vessel. Split ratios of 1.5:1 to 4:1 may be used. Results of the distillation process are shown in Table 5 below.

The process involves dissolution of crude product in a two component system (methanol and acetonitrile) followed by distillation to optimize recovery. The typical recovery is between 89-92%. The alkene that ultimately forms impurity D is partially removed from the mother liquor during this recrystallization. The recrystallization increases the purity of norbuprenorphine to > 96%. The recrystallization can also remove a high amount of 3-O-methylnorbuprenorphine to less than <1% (initially 13% by area percent). The results are shown in Table 6 below.
