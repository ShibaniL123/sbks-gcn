BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Polyolefins such as high density polyethylene (HDPE) homopolymer and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) copolymer can be produced using various combinations of catalyst systems and polymerization processes. Medium or high density polymers with a high molecular weight and a broad molecular weight distribution often have a combination of relatively easy processing, superior melt strength, and a good balance of stiffness and physical properties. In some end-use applications, however, it can be beneficial to have this combination of properties, but also to have improved puncture, impact, and tear resistance. Accordingly, it is to these ends that the present invention is directed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the detailed description. This summary is not intended to identify required or essential features of the claimed subject matter. Nor is this summary intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. The present invention generally relates to new catalyst compositions, methods for preparing catalyst compositions, methods for using the catalyst compositions to polymerize olefins, the polymer resins produced using such catalyst compositions, and articles produced using these polymer resins. In particular, embodiments of the present invention are directed to catalyst compositions employing two metallocene catalyst components. The first catalyst component generally can produce a lower molecular component having high amounts of long chain branches (e.g., a two carbon bridged metallocene compound containing two cyclopentadienyl groups, two indenyl groups, or a cyclopentadienyl and an indenyl group), while the second catalyst component generally can produce a higher molecular weight component having very few long chain branches (e.g., a single atom bridged metallocene compound containing a fluorenyl group). Typically, the weight percentage of the first catalyst component can be in a range from about 25 to about 98%, based on the total weight of the first and second catalyst components. Such catalyst compositions can be used to produce, for example, ethylene-based copolymers having the majority of the long chain branches in the lower molecular weights, and the majority of the short chain branches in the higher molecular weights. The present invention also contemplates and encompasses olefin polymerization processes. Such processes can comprise contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and optionally an olefin comonomer under polymerization conditions to produce an olefin polymer. Generally, the catalyst composition employed can comprise any of the catalyst component I metallocene compounds, any of the catalyst component II metallocene compounds, and any of the activators and optional co-catalysts disclosed herein. For example, organoaluminum compounds can be utilized in the catalyst compositions and/or polymerization processes. Polymers produced from the polymerization of olefins, resulting in homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers, etc., can be used to produce various articles of manufacture. A representative and non-limiting example of an olefin polymer (e.g., an ethylene copolymer) consistent with embodiments of this invention can comprise a higher molecular weight component and a lower molecular weight component, and can be characterized as having the following properties: a ratio of the Mp of the higher molecular weight component to the Mp of the lower molecular weight component in a range from about 5:1 to about 100:1, a number of LCB of the lower molecular weight component in a range from about 5 to about 50 LCB per million total carbon atoms, and a number of LCB of the higher molecular weight component of less than or equal to about 5 LCB per million total carbon atoms. Another representative and non-limiting ethylene-based polymer described herein can have a lower molecular weight component having a Mp in a range from about 15 to about 80 kg/mol, and from about 5 to about 50 LCB per million total carbon atoms, and a higher molecular weight component having a Mp in a range from about 150 to about 800 kg/mol, and less than or equal to about 5 LCB per million total carbon atoms. Yet another representative and non-limiting ethylene-based polymer described herein can have a ratio of the Mp of the higher molecular weight component to the Mp of the lower molecular weight component in a range from about 5:1 to about 100:1, and a ratio of the number of LCB of the polymer to the number of LCB of the higher molecular weight component, per millions total carbon atoms, in a range from about 2:1 to about 100:1. And yet another representative and non-limiting ethylene-based polymer described herein can have a ratio of the Mp of the higher molecular weight component to the Mp of the lower molecular weight component in a range from about 5:1 to about 100:1, a number of LCB of the higher molecular weight component of less than or equal to about 5 LCB per million total carbon atoms, and a number of LCB of the olefin polymer in a range from about 2 to about 30 LCB per million total carbon atoms. Moreover, blown films comprising olefin polymers disclosed herein, for instance, having a melt index less than or equal to about 0.4 g/10 min, can have very high puncture/impact resistance properties, such as a dart impact strength greater than or equal to about 300 g/mil. Both the foregoing summary and the following detailed description provide examples and are explanatory only. Accordingly, the foregoing summary and the following detailed description should not be considered to be restrictive. Further, features or variations may be provided in addition to those set forth herein. For example, certain aspects and embodiments may be directed to various feature combinations and sub-combinations described in the detailed description.

DEFINITIONS To define more clearly the terms used herein, the following definitions are provided. Unless otherwise indicated, the following definitions are applicable to this disclosure. If a term is used in this disclosure but is not specifically defined herein, the definition from the IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd Ed (1997), can be applied, as long as that definition does not conflict with any other disclosure or definition applied herein, or render indefinite or non-enabled any claim to which that definition is applied. To the extent that any definition or usage provided by any document incorporated herein by reference conflicts with the definition or usage provided herein, the definition or usage provided herein controls. While compositions and methods are described herein in terms of “comprising” various components or steps, the compositions and methods can also “consist essentially of” or “consist of” the various components or steps, unless stated otherwise. For example, a catalyst composition consistent with embodiments of the present invention can comprise; alternatively, can consist essentially of; or alternatively, can consist of; (i) catalyst component I, (ii) catalyst component II, (iii) an activator, and (iv) optionally, a co-catalyst. The terms “a,” “an,” “the,” etc., are intended to include plural alternatives, e.g., at least one, unless otherwise specified. For instance, the disclosure of “an activator-support” or “a metallocene compound” is meant to encompass one, or mixtures or combinations of more than one, activator-support or metallocene compound, respectively, unless otherwise specified. Generally, groups of elements are indicated using the numbering scheme indicated in the version of the periodic table of elements published in Chemical and Engineering News, 63(5), 27, 1985. In some instances, a group of elements can be indicated using a common name assigned to the group; for example, alkali metals for Group 1 elements, alkaline earth metals for Group 2 elements, transition metals for Group 3-12 elements, and halogens or halides for Group 17 elements. For any particular compound disclosed herein, the general structure or name presented is also intended to encompass all structural isomers, conformational isomers, and stereoisomers that can arise from a particular set of substituents, unless indicated otherwise. Thus, a general reference to a compound includes all structural isomers unless explicitly indicated otherwise; e.g., a general reference to pentane includes n-pentane, 2-methyl-butane, and 2,2-dimethylpropane, while a general reference to a butyl group includes an n-butyl group, a sec-butyl group, an iso-butyl group, and a tert-butyl group. Additionally, the reference to a general structure or name encompasses all enantiomers, diastereomers, and other optical isomers whether in enantiomeric or racemic forms, as well as mixtures of stereoisomers, as the context permits or requires. For any particular formula or name that is presented, any general formula or name presented also encompasses all conformational isomers, regioisomers, and stereoisomers that can arise from a particular set of substituents. The term “substituted” when used to describe a group, for example, when referring to a substituted analog of a particular group, is intended to describe any non-hydrogen moiety that formally replaces a hydrogen in that group, and is intended to be non-limiting. A group or groups can also be referred to herein as “unsubstituted” or by equivalent terms such as “non-substituted,” which refers to the original group in which a non-hydrogen moiety does not replace a hydrogen within that group. Unless otherwise specified, “substituted” is intended to be non-limiting and include inorganic substituents or organic substituents as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. The term “hydrocarbon” whenever used in this specification and claims refers to a compound containing only carbon and hydrogen. Other identifiers can be utilized to indicate the presence of particular groups in the hydrocarbon (e.g., halogenated hydrocarbon indicates the presence of one or more halogen atoms replacing an equivalent number of hydrogen atoms in the hydrocarbon). The term “hydrocarbyl group” is used herein in accordance with the definition specified by IUPAC: a univalent group formed by removing a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon (that is, a group containing only carbon and hydrogen). Non-limiting examples of hydrocarbyl groups include alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, and aralkyl groups, amongst other groups. The term “polymer” is used herein generically to include olefin homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers, and so forth. A copolymer is derived from an olefin monomer and one olefin comonomer, while a terpolymer is derived from an olefin monomer and two olefin comonomers. Accordingly, “polymer” encompasses copolymers, terpolymers, etc., derived from any olefin monomer and comonomer(s) disclosed herein. Similarly, an ethylene polymer would include ethylene homopolymers, ethylene copolymers, ethylene terpolymers, and the like. As an example, an olefin copolymer, such as an ethylene copolymer, can be derived from ethylene and a comonomer, such as 1-butene, 1-hexene, or 1-octene. If the monomer and comonomer were ethylene and 1-hexene, respectively, the resulting polymer can be categorized an as ethylene/1-hexene copolymer. In like manner, the scope of the term “polymerization” includes homopolymerization, copolymerization, terpolymerization, etc. Therefore, a copolymerization process can involve contacting one olefin monomer (e.g., ethylene) and one olefin comonomer (e.g., 1-hexene) to produce a copolymer. The term “co-catalyst” is used generally herein to refer to compounds such as aluminoxane compounds, organoboron or organoborate compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, organoaluminum compounds, organozinc compounds, organomagnesium compounds, organolithium compounds, and the like, that can constitute one component of a catalyst composition, when used, for example, in addition to an activator-support. The term “co-catalyst” is used regardless of the actual function of the compound or any chemical mechanism by which the compound may operate. The terms “chemically-treated solid oxide,” “treated solid oxide compound,” and the like, are used herein to indicate a solid, inorganic oxide of relatively high porosity, which can exhibit Lewis acidic or Brønsted acidic behavior, and which has been treated with an electron-withdrawing component, typically an anion, and which is calcined. The electron-withdrawing component is typically an electron-withdrawing anion source compound. Thus, the chemically-treated solid oxide can comprise a calcined contact product of at least one solid oxide with at least one electron-withdrawing anion source compound. Typically, the chemically-treated solid oxide comprises at least one acidic solid oxide compound. The “activator-support” of the present invention can be a chemically-treated solid oxide. The terms “support” and “activator-support” are not used to imply these components are inert, and such components should not be construed as an inert component of the catalyst composition. The term “activator,” as used herein, refers generally to a substance that is capable of converting a metallocene component into a catalyst that can polymerize olefins, or converting a contact product of a metallocene component and a component that provides an activatable ligand (e.g., an alkyl, a hydride) to the metallocene, when the metallocene compound does not already comprise such a ligand, into a catalyst that can polymerize olefins. This term is used regardless of the actual activating mechanism. Illustrative activators include activator-supports, aluminoxanes, organoboron or organoborate compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, and the like. Aluminoxanes, organoboron or organoborate compounds, and ionizing ionic compounds generally are referred to as activators if used in a catalyst composition in which an activator-support is not present. If the catalyst composition contains an activator-support, then the aluminoxane, organoboron or organoborate, and ionizing ionic materials are typically referred to as co-catalysts. The term “metallocene” as used herein describes compounds comprising at least one η3 to η5-cycloalkadienyl-type moiety, wherein η3 to η5-cycloalkadienyl moieties include cyclopentadienyl ligands, indenyl ligands, fluorenyl ligands, and the like, including partially saturated or substituted derivatives or analogs of any of these. Possible substituents on these ligands may include H, therefore this invention comprises ligands such as tetrahydroindenyl, tetrahydrofluorenyl, octahydrofluorenyl, partially saturated indenyl, partially saturated fluorenyl, substituted partially saturated indenyl, substituted partially saturated fluorenyl, and the like. In some contexts, the metallocene is referred to simply as the “catalyst,” in much the same way the term “co-catalyst” is used herein to refer to, for example, an organoaluminum compound. The terms “catalyst composition,” “catalyst mixture,” “catalyst system,” and the like, do not depend upon the actual product or composition resulting from the contact or reaction of the initial components of the disclosed or claimed catalyst composition/mixture/system, the nature of the active catalytic site, or the fate of the co-catalyst, the metallocene compound(s), or the activator (e.g., activator-support), after combining these components. Therefore, the terms “catalyst composition,” “catalyst mixture,” “catalyst system,” and the like, encompass the initial starting components of the composition, as well as whatever product(s) may result from contacting these initial starting components, and this is inclusive of both heterogeneous and homogenous catalyst systems or compositions. The terms “catalyst composition,” “catalyst mixture,” “catalyst system,” and the like, can be used interchangeably throughout this disclosure. The term “contact product” is used herein to describe compositions wherein the components are contacted together in any order, in any manner, and for any length of time. For example, the components can be contacted by blending or mixing. Further, contacting of any component can occur in the presence or absence of any other component of the compositions described herein. Combining additional materials or components can be done by any suitable method. Further, the term “contact product” includes mixtures, blends, solutions, slurries, reaction products, and the like, or combinations thereof. Although “contact product” can include reaction products, it is not required for the respective components to react with one another. Similarly, the term “contacting” is used herein to refer to materials which can be blended, mixed, slurried, dissolved, reacted, treated, or otherwise contacted in some other manner. Although any methods, devices, and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the invention, the typical methods, devices and materials are herein described. All publications and patents mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of describing and disclosing, for example, the constructs and methodologies that are described in the publications, which might be used in connection with the presently described invention. The publications discussed throughout the text are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the inventors are not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention. Applicants disclose several types of ranges in the present invention. When Applicants disclose or claim a range of any type, Applicants' intent is to disclose or claim individually each possible number that such a range could reasonably encompass, including end points of the range as well as any sub-ranges and combinations of sub-ranges encompassed therein. For example, when the Applicants disclose or claim a chemical moiety having a certain number of carbon atoms, Applicants' intent is to disclose or claim individually every possible number that such a range could encompass, consistent with the disclosure herein. For example, the disclosure that a moiety is a C1 to C18 hydrocarbyl group, or in alternative language, a hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, as used herein, refers to a moiety that can have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, or 18 carbon atoms, as well as any range between these two numbers (for example, a C1 to C8 hydrocarbyl group), and also including any combination of ranges between these two numbers (for example, a C2 to C4 and a C12 to C16 hydrocarbyl group). Similarly, another representative example follows for the number-average molecular weight (Mn) of an olefin polymer produced in an embodiment of this invention. By a disclosure that the Mn can be in a range from about 10 to about 50 kg/mol, Applicants intend to recite that the Mn can be any molecular weight in the range and, for example, can be equal to about 10, about 15, about 20, about 25, about 30, about 35, about 40, about 45, or about 50 kg/mol. Additionally, the Mn can be within any range from about 10 to about 50 (for example, from about 10 to about 25), and this also includes any combination of ranges between about 10 and about 50 (for example, the Mn can be in a range from about 10 to about 20, or from about 25 to about 45 kg/mol). Likewise, all other ranges disclosed herein should be interpreted in a manner similar to these two examples. Applicants reserve the right to proviso out or exclude any individual members of any such group, including any sub-ranges or combinations of sub-ranges within the group, that can be claimed according to a range or in any similar manner, if for any reason Applicants choose to claim less than the full measure of the disclosure, for example, to account for a reference that Applicants may be unaware of at the time of the filing of the application. Further, Applicants reserve the right to proviso out or exclude any individual substituents, analogs, compounds, ligands, structures, or groups thereof, or any members of a claimed group, if for any reason Applicants choose to claim less than the full measure of the disclosure, for example, to account for a reference that Applicants may be unaware of at the time of the filing of the application.

Co-catalysts that can be used in the catalyst compositions of this invention are not limited to the co-catalysts described above. Other suitable co-catalysts are well known to those of skill in the art including, for example, those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,242,099, 4,794,096, 4,808,561, 5,576,259, 5,807,938, 5,919,983, 7,294,599 7,601,665, 7,884,163, 8,114,946, and 8,309,485, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Olefin Monomers Unsaturated reactants that can be employed with catalyst compositions and polymerization processes of this invention typically can include olefin compounds having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms per molecule and having at least one olefinic double bond. This invention encompasses homopolymerization processes using a single olefin such as ethylene or propylene, as well as copolymerization, terpolymerization, etc., reactions using an olefin monomer with at least one different olefinic compound. For example, the resultant ethylene copolymers, terpolymers, etc., generally can contain a major amount of ethylene (>50 mole percent) and a minor amount of comonomer (<50 mole percent), though this is not a requirement. Comonomers that can be copolymerized with ethylene often can have from 3 to 20 carbon atoms, or from 3 to 10 carbon atoms, in their molecular chain. Acyclic, cyclic, polycyclic, terminal (α), internal, linear, branched, substituted, unsubstituted, functionalized, and non-functionalized olefins can be employed in this invention. For example, typical unsaturated compounds that can be polymerized with the catalyst compositions of this invention can include, but are not limited to, ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 2-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, isobutylene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, 3-ethyl-1-hexene, 1-heptene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, the four normal octenes (e.g., 1-octene), the four normal nonenes, the five normal decenes, and the like, or mixtures of two or more of these compounds. Cyclic and bicyclic olefins, including but not limited to, cyclopentene, cyclohexene, norbornylene, norbornadiene, and the like, also can be polymerized as described herein. Styrene can also be employed as a monomer in the present invention. In an embodiment, the olefin monomer can comprise a C2-C20 olefin; alternatively, a C2-C20 alpha-olefin; alternatively, a C2-C10 olefin; alternatively, a C2-C10 alpha-olefin; alternatively, the olefin monomer can comprise ethylene; or alternatively, the olefin monomer can comprise propylene. When a copolymer (or alternatively, a terpolymer) is desired, the olefin monomer and the olefin comonomer independently can comprise, for example, a C2-C20 alpha-olefin. In some embodiments, the olefin monomer can comprise ethylene or propylene, which is copolymerized with at least one comonomer (e.g., a C2-C20 alpha-olefin, a C3-C20 alpha-olefin, etc.). According to one embodiment of this invention, the olefin monomer used in the polymerization process can comprise ethylene. In this embodiment, examples of suitable olefin comonomers can include, but are not limited to, propylene, 1-butene, 2-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, isobutylene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-ethyl-1-hexene, 1-heptene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, 1-octene, 1-decene, styrene, and the like, or combinations thereof. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the olefin monomer can comprise ethylene, and the comonomer can comprise a C3-C10 alpha-olefin; alternatively, the comonomer can comprise 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, styrene, or any combination thereof; alternatively, the comonomer can comprise 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, or any combination thereof; alternatively, the comonomer can comprise 1-butene; alternatively, the comonomer can comprise 1-hexene; or alternatively, the comonomer can comprise 1-octene. Generally, the amount of comonomer introduced into a polymerization reactor system to produce a copolymer can be from about 0.01 to about 50 weight percent of the comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the amount of comonomer introduced into a polymerization reactor system can be from about 0.01 to about 40 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. In still another embodiment, the amount of comonomer introduced into a polymerization reactor system can be from about 0.1 to about 35 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. Yet, in another embodiment, the amount of comonomer introduced into a polymerization reactor system can be from about 0.5 to about 20 weight percent comonomer based on the total weight of the monomer and comonomer. While not intending to be bound by this theory, where branched, substituted, or functionalized olefins are used as reactants, it is believed that a steric hindrance can impede and/or slow the polymerization process. Thus, branched and/or cyclic portion(s) of the olefin removed somewhat from the carbon-carbon double bond would not be expected to hinder the reaction in the way that the same olefin substituents situated more proximate to the carbon-carbon double bond might. According to one embodiment of the present invention, at least one monomer/reactant can be ethylene (or propylene), so the polymerization reaction can be a homopolymerization involving only ethylene (or propylene), or a copolymerization with a different acyclic, cyclic, terminal, internal, linear, branched, substituted, or unsubstituted olefin. In addition, the catalyst compositions of this invention can be used in the polymerization of diolefin compounds including, but not limited to, 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, 1,4-pentadiene, and 1,5-hexadiene. Catalyst Compositions In some embodiments, the present invention can employ catalyst compositions containing catalyst component I, catalyst component II, an activator (one or more than one), and optionally, a co-catalyst. These catalyst compositions can be utilized to produce polyolefins—homopolymers, copolymers, and the like—for a variety of end-use applications. Catalyst components I and II are discussed hereinabove. In embodiments of the present invention, it is contemplated that the catalyst composition can contain more than one catalyst component I metallocene compound, and/or more than one catalyst component II metallocene compound. Further, additional catalytic compounds—other than those specified as catalyst component I or II—can be employed in the catalyst compositions and/or the polymerization processes, provided that the additional catalytic compound(s) does not detract from the advantages disclosed herein. Additionally, more than one activator also may be utilized. The metallocene compounds of catalyst component I are discussed hereinabove. For instance, in some embodiments, catalyst component I can comprise (or consist essentially of, or consist of) a two carbon bridged metallocene compound containing two cyclopentadienyl groups, two indenyl groups, or a cyclopentadienyl and an indenyl group (e.g., a metallocene compound having formula (A)). The metallocene compounds of catalyst component II also are discussed hereinabove. For instance, in some embodiments, catalyst component II can comprise (or consist essentially of, or consist of) a single atom bridged metallocene compound containing a fluorenyl group (e.g., a metallocene compound having formula (B)). Generally, catalyst compositions of the present invention can comprise catalyst component I, catalyst component II, and an activator. In embodiments of the invention, the activator can comprise an activator-support (e.g., an activator-support comprising a solid oxide treated with an electron-withdrawing anion). Activator-supports useful in the present invention are disclosed hereinabove. Optionally, such catalyst compositions can further comprise one or more than one co-catalyst compound or compounds (suitable co-catalysts, such as organoaluminum compounds, also are discussed hereinabove). Thus, a catalyst composition of this invention can comprise catalyst component I, catalyst component II, an activator-support, and an organoaluminum compound. For instance, the activator-support can comprise (or consist essentially of, or consist of) fluorided alumina, chlorided alumina, bromided alumina, sulfated alumina, fluorided silica-alumina, chlorided silica-alumina, bromided silica-alumina, sulfated silica-alumina, fluorided silica-zirconia, chlorided silica-zirconia, bromided silica-zirconia, sulfated silica-zirconia, fluorided silica-titania, fluorided silica-coated alumina, sulfated silica-coated alumina, phosphated silica-coated alumina, and the like, or combinations thereof; alternatively, the activator-support can comprise (or consist essentially of, or consist of) a fluorided solid oxide and/or a sulfated solid oxide. Additionally, the organoaluminum compound can comprise (or consist essentially of, or consist of) trimethylaluminum, triethylaluminum, tri-n-propylaluminum, tri-n-butylaluminum, triisobutylaluminum, tri-n-hexylaluminum, tri-n-octylaluminum, diisobutylaluminum hydride, diethylaluminum ethoxide, diethylaluminum chloride, and the like, or combinations thereof. Accordingly, a catalyst composition consistent with embodiments of the invention can comprise (or consist essentially of, or consist of) a two carbon bridged, zirconium based metallocene compound; a single atom bridged, zirconium or hafnium based metallocene compound with cyclopentadienyl group and a fluorenyl group; sulfated alumina (or fluorided silica-alumina, or fluorided silica-coated alumina); and triethylaluminum (or triisobutylaluminum). In another embodiment of the present invention, a catalyst composition is provided which comprises catalyst component I, catalyst component II, an activator-support, and an organoaluminum compound, wherein this catalyst composition is substantially free of aluminoxanes, organoboron or organoborate compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, and/or other similar materials; alternatively, substantially free of aluminoxanes; alternatively, substantially free or organoboron or organoborate compounds; or alternatively, substantially free of ionizing ionic compounds. In these embodiments, the catalyst composition has catalyst activity, discussed below, in the absence of these additional materials. For example, a catalyst composition of the present invention can consist essentially of catalyst component I, catalyst component II, an activator-support, and an organoaluminum compound, wherein no other materials are present in the catalyst composition which would increase/decrease the activity of the catalyst composition by more than about 10% from the catalyst activity of the catalyst composition in the absence of said materials. However, in other embodiments of this invention, these activators/co-catalysts can be employed. For example, a catalyst composition comprising catalyst component I, catalyst component II, and an activator-support can further comprise a co-catalyst. Suitable co-catalysts in this embodiment can include, but are not limited to, aluminoxane compounds, organoboron or organoborate compounds, ionizing ionic compounds, organoaluminum compounds, organozinc compounds, organomagnesium compounds, organolithium compounds, and the like, or any combination thereof; or alternatively, organoaluminum compounds, organozinc compounds, organomagnesium compounds, organolithium compounds, or any combination thereof. More than one co-catalyst can be present in the catalyst composition. In a different embodiment, a catalyst composition is provided which does not require an activator-support. Such a catalyst composition can comprise catalyst component I, catalyst component II, and an activator, wherein the activator comprises an aluminoxane compound, an organoboron or organoborate compound, an ionizing ionic compound, or combinations thereof; alternatively, an aluminoxane compound; alternatively, an organoboron or organoborate compound; or alternatively, an ionizing ionic compound. In a particular embodiment contemplated herein, the catalyst composition is a catalyst composition comprising an activator (one or more than one), only one catalyst component I metallocene compound, and only one catalyst component II metallocene compound. In these and other embodiments, the catalyst composition can comprise an activator (e.g., an activator-support comprising a solid oxide treated with an electron-withdrawing anion); only one two carbon bridged metallocene compound containing two cyclopentadienyl groups, two indenyl groups, or a cyclopentadienyl and an indenyl group; only one single atom bridged metallocene compound containing a fluorenyl group; and optionally, a co-catalyst. This invention further encompasses methods of making these catalyst compositions, such as, for example, contacting the respective catalyst components in any order or sequence. According to an embodiment of this invention, the weight percentage of catalyst component I, based on the total weight of catalyst component I and catalyst component II in the catalyst composition, typically can fall within a range from about 25 to about 98%, from about 40 to about 95%, from about 55 to about 98%, or from about 60 to about 95%. Generally, the weight ratio of organoaluminum compound to activator-support can be in a range from about 10:1 to about 1:1000. If more than one organoaluminum compound and/or more than one activator-support is employed, this ratio is based on the total weight of each respective component. In another embodiment, the weight ratio of the organoaluminum compound to the activator-support can be in a range from about 3:1 to about 1:100, or from about 1:1 to about 1:50. In some embodiments of this invention, the weight ratio of metallocene compounds (total of catalyst component I and II) to activator-support can be in a range from about 1:1 to about 1:1,000,000. If more than one activator-support is employed, this ratio is based on the total weight of the activator-support. In another embodiment, this weight ratio can be in a range from about 1:5 to about 1:100,000, or from about 1:10 to about 1:10,000. Yet, in another embodiment, the weight ratio of the metallocene compounds to the activator-support can be in a range from about 1:20 to about 1:1000. Catalyst compositions of the present invention generally have a catalyst activity greater than about 100 grams of polyethylene (homopolymer, copolymer, etc., as the context requires) per gram of activator-support per hour (abbreviated g/g/hr). In another embodiment, the catalyst activity can greater than about 150, greater than about 250, or greater than about 500 g/g/hr. In still another embodiment, catalyst compositions of this invention can be characterized by having a catalyst activity greater than about 550, greater than about 650, or greater than about 750 g/g/hr. Yet, in another embodiment, the catalyst activity can be greater than about 1000 g/g/hr. These activities are measured under slurry polymerization conditions, with a triisobutylaluminum co-catalyst, using isobutane as the diluent, at a polymerization temperature of about 90° C. and a reactor pressure of about 390 psig.

In accordance with yet another embodiment of the invention, the polymerization process can employ a catalyst composition comprising catalyst component I, catalyst component II, and an activator, wherein the activator comprises an aluminoxane compound, an organoboron or organoborate compound, an ionizing ionic compound, or combinations thereof. The catalyst compositions of the present invention are intended for any olefin polymerization method using various types of polymerization reactor systems and reactors. The polymerization reactor system can include any polymerization reactor capable of polymerizing olefin monomers and comonomers (one or more than one comonomer) to produce homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers, and the like. The various types of reactors include those that can be referred to as a batch reactor, slurry reactor, gas-phase reactor, solution reactor, high pressure reactor, tubular reactor, autoclave reactor, and the like, or combinations thereof. Suitable polymerization conditions are used for the various reactor types. Gas phase reactors can comprise fluidized bed reactors or staged horizontal reactors. Slurry reactors can comprise vertical or horizontal loops. High pressure reactors can comprise autoclave or tubular reactors. Reactor types can include batch or continuous processes. Continuous processes can use intermittent or continuous product discharge. Processes can also include partial or full direct recycle of unreacted monomer, unreacted comonomer, and/or diluent. Polymerization reactor systems of the present invention can comprise one type of reactor in a system or multiple reactors of the same or different type (e.g., a single reactor, dual reactor, more than two reactors). Production of polymers in multiple reactors can include several stages in at least two separate polymerization reactors interconnected by a transfer device making it possible to transfer the polymers resulting from the first polymerization reactor into the second reactor. The desired polymerization conditions in one of the reactors can be different from the operating conditions of the other reactor(s). Alternatively, polymerization in multiple reactors can include the manual transfer of polymer from one reactor to subsequent reactors for continued polymerization. Multiple reactor systems can include any combination including, but not limited to, multiple loop reactors, multiple gas phase reactors, a combination of loop and gas phase reactors, multiple high pressure reactors, or a combination of high pressure with loop and/or gas phase reactors. The multiple reactors can be operated in series, in parallel, or both. Accordingly, the present invention encompasses polymerization reactor systems comprising a single reactor, comprising two reactors, and comprising more than two reactors. The polymerization reactor system can comprise a slurry reactor, a gas-phase reactor, a solution reactor, in certain embodiments of this invention, as well as multi-reactor combinations thereof. According to one embodiment of the invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise at least one loop slurry reactor comprising vertical or horizontal loops. Monomer, diluent, catalyst, and comonomer can be continuously fed to a loop reactor where polymerization occurs. Generally, continuous processes can comprise the continuous introduction of monomer/comonomer, a catalyst, and a diluent into a polymerization reactor and the continuous removal from this reactor of a suspension comprising polymer particles and the diluent. Reactor effluent can be flashed to remove the solid polymer from the liquids that comprise the diluent, monomer and/or comonomer. Various technologies can be used for this separation step including, but not limited to, flashing that can include any combination of heat addition and pressure reduction, separation by cyclonic action in either a cyclone or hydrocyclone, or separation by centrifugation. A typical slurry polymerization process (also known as the particle form process) is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,248,179, 4,501,885, 5,565,175, 5,575,979, 6,239,235, 6,262,191, and 6,833,415, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Suitable diluents used in slurry polymerization include, but are not limited to, the monomer being polymerized and hydrocarbons that are liquids under polymerization conditions. Examples of suitable diluents include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbons such as propane, cyclohexane, isobutane, n-butane, n-pentane, isopentane, neopentane, and n-hexane. Some loop polymerization reactions can occur under bulk conditions where no diluent is used. An example is polymerization of propylene monomer as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,455,314, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. According to yet another embodiment of this invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise at least one gas phase reactor. Such systems can employ a continuous recycle stream containing one or more monomers continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of the catalyst under polymerization conditions. A recycle stream can be withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product can be withdrawn from the reactor and new or fresh monomer can be added to replace the polymerized monomer. Such gas phase reactors can comprise a process for multi-step gas-phase polymerization of olefins, in which olefins are polymerized in the gaseous phase in at least two independent gas-phase polymerization zones while feeding a catalyst-containing polymer formed in a first polymerization zone to a second polymerization zone. One type of gas phase reactor is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,352,749, 4,588,790, and 5,436,304, each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. According to still another embodiment of the invention, a high pressure polymerization reactor can comprise a tubular reactor or an autoclave reactor. Tubular reactors can have several zones where fresh monomer, initiators, or catalysts are added. Monomer can be entrained in an inert gaseous stream and introduced at one zone of the reactor. Initiators, catalysts, and/or catalyst components can be entrained in a gaseous stream and introduced at another zone of the reactor. The gas streams can be intermixed for polymerization. Heat and pressure can be employed appropriately to obtain optimal polymerization reaction conditions. According to yet another embodiment of the invention, the polymerization reactor system can comprise a solution polymerization reactor wherein the monomer (and comonomer, if used) are contacted with the catalyst composition by suitable stirring or other means. A carrier comprising an inert organic diluent or excess monomer can be employed. If desired, the monomer/comonomer can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures and pressures that will result in the formation of a solution of the polymer in a reaction medium. Agitation can be employed to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures throughout the polymerization zone. Adequate means are utilized for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization. Polymerization reactor systems suitable for the present invention can further comprise any combination of at least one raw material feed system, at least one feed system for catalyst or catalyst components, and/or at least one polymer recovery system. Suitable reactor systems for the present invention can further comprise systems for feedstock purification, catalyst storage and preparation, extrusion, reactor cooling, polymer recovery, fractionation, recycle, storage, loadout, laboratory analysis, and process control. Polymerization conditions that are controlled for efficiency and to provide desired polymer properties can include temperature, pressure, and the concentrations of various reactants. Polymerization temperature can affect catalyst productivity, polymer molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution. A suitable polymerization temperature can be any temperature below the de-polymerization temperature according to the Gibbs Free energy equation. Typically, this includes from about 60° C. to about 280° C., for example, or from about 60° C. to about 120° C., depending upon the type of polymerization reactor(s). In some reactor systems, the polymerization temperature generally can fall within a range from about 70° C. to about 100° C., or from about 75° C. to about 95° C. Various polymerization conditions can be held substantially constant, for example, for the production of a particular grade of olefin polymer. Suitable pressures will also vary according to the reactor and polymerization type. The pressure for liquid phase polymerizations in a loop reactor is typically less than 1000 psig (6.9 MPa). Pressure for gas phase polymerization is usually at about 200 to 500 psig (1.4 MPa to 3.4 MPa). High pressure polymerization in tubular or autoclave reactors is generally run at about 20,000 to 75,000 psig (138 to 517 MPa). Polymerization reactors can also be operated in a supercritical region occurring at generally higher temperatures and pressures. Operation above the critical point of a pressure/temperature diagram (supercritical phase) may offer advantages. Embodiments of this invention are directed to olefin polymerization processes comprising contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and an optional olefin comonomer in a polymerization reactor system under polymerization conditions to produce an olefin polymer. The olefin polymer (e.g., ethylene copolymer) produced by the process can have any of the polymer properties disclosed herein. Embodiments of this invention also are directed to olefin polymerization processes conducted in the absence of added hydrogen. An olefin polymerization process of this invention can comprise contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and optionally an olefin comonomer in a polymerization reactor system under polymerization conditions to produce an olefin polymer, wherein the catalyst composition can comprise catalyst component I, catalyst component II, an activator, and an optional co-catalyst, and wherein the polymerization process is conducted in the absence of added hydrogen (no hydrogen is added to the polymerization reactor system). As one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize, hydrogen can be generated in-situ by metallocene catalyst compositions in various olefin polymerization processes, and the amount generated can vary depending upon the specific catalyst composition and metallocene compound(s) employed, the type of polymerization process used, the polymerization reaction conditions utilized, and so forth. In other embodiments, it may be desirable to conduct the polymerization process in the presence of a certain amount of added hydrogen. Accordingly, an olefin polymerization process of this invention can comprise contacting a catalyst composition with an olefin monomer and optionally an olefin comonomer in a polymerization reactor system under polymerization conditions to produce an olefin polymer, wherein the catalyst composition comprises catalyst component I, catalyst component II, an activator, and an optional co-catalyst, and wherein the polymerization process is conducted in the presence of added hydrogen (hydrogen is added to the polymerization reactor system). For example, the ratio of hydrogen to the olefin monomer in the polymerization process can be controlled, often by the feed ratio of hydrogen to the olefin monomer entering the reactor. The added hydrogen to olefin monomer ratio in the process can be controlled at a weight ratio which falls within a range from about 25 ppm to about 1500 ppm, from about 50 to about 1000 ppm, or from about 100 ppm to about 750 ppm. In some embodiments of this invention, the feed or reactant ratio of hydrogen to olefin monomer can be maintained substantially constant during the polymerization run for a particular polymer grade. That is, the hydrogen:olefin monomer ratio can be selected at a particular ratio within a range from about 5 ppm up to about 1000 ppm or so, and maintained at the ratio to within about +/−25% during the polymerization run. For instance, if the target ratio is 100 ppm, then maintaining the hydrogen:olefin monomer ratio substantially constant would entail maintaining the feed ratio between about 75 ppm and about 125 ppm. Further, the addition of comonomer (or comonomers) can be, and generally is, substantially constant throughout the polymerization run for a particular polymer grade. However, in other embodiments, it is contemplated that monomer, comonomer (or comonomers), and/or hydrogen can be periodically pulsed to the reactor, for instance, in a manner similar to that employed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,220 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0059070, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The concentration of the reactants entering the polymerization reactor system can be controlled to produce resins with certain physical and mechanical properties. The proposed end-use product that will be formed by the polymer resin and the method of forming that product ultimately can determine the desired polymer properties and attributes. Mechanical properties include tensile, flexural, impact, creep, stress relaxation, and hardness tests. Physical properties include density, molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, melting temperature, glass transition temperature, temperature melt of crystallization, density, stereoregularity, crack growth, long chain branching, and rheological measurements.

In one embodiment, the olefin polymer can be an ethylene/1-butene copolymer, an ethylene/1-hexene copolymer, or an ethylene/1-octene copolymer, while in another embodiment, the olefin polymer can be an ethylene/1-hexene copolymer.

As described herein, olefin polymers (e.g., ethylene copolymers) can have a lower molecular weight component and a higher molecular weight component.

As described herein, the number of long chain branches (LCB) in the lower molecular weight component and the number of LCB in the higher molecular weight component are determined by performing a polymerization experiment for each catalyst component separately (e.g., a two carbon bridged metallocene compound having formula (A) or a single atom bridged metallocene compound having formula (B)) to produce a polymer having a Mw in the 100-125 kg/mol range, and then applying the Janzen-Colby method for determining the number of LCB per million carbon atoms.

Applicants also contemplate a method for making a film (e.g., a blown film, a cast film, etc.) comprising any olefin polymer disclosed herein. For instance, the method can comprise melt processing the olefin polymer through a die to form the film. Suitably, the die can be configured based on the film to be produced, for example, an annular blown film die to produce a blown film, a slot or cast film die to produce a cast film, and so forth. Moreover, any suitable means of melt processing can be employed, although extrusion typically can be utilized. As above, additives can be combined with the polymer in the melt processing step (extrusion step), such as antioxidants, acid scavengers, antiblock additives, slip additives, colorants, fillers, processing aids, UV inhibitors, and the like, as well as combinations thereof. Films disclosed herein, whether cast or blown, can be any thickness that is suitable for the particular end-use application, and often, the film thickness can be in a range from about 0.25 to about 250 mils, or from about 0.4 to about 100 mils. For thin film applications, typical thicknesses can be in a range from about 0.25 to about 10 mils, from about 0.4 to about 5 mils, from about 0.5 to about 2 mils, or from about 0.5 to about 1.5 mils. In an embodiment and unexpectedly, the films disclosed herein (e.g., blown films) can have a high dart impact strength (at a low melt index). Further, such films also can have relatively high haze and shrink, and low COF properties, as compared to conventional blown films of generally the same nominal density. For instance, a blown film consistent with embodiments of this invention can comprise an olefin polymer having a melt index less than or equal to about 0.4 g/10 min, and the blown film (produced under LLDPE and/or HDPE conditions) can have a dart impact strength greater than or equal to about 300 g/mil. In some embodiments, the film (produced under LLDPE and/or HDPE conditions) can have a dart impact strength in a range from about 300 to about 2000, from about 400 to about 2000, from about 500 to about 2000, from about 600 to about 2000, or from about 700 to about 2000 g/mil. The olefin polymer, for example, an ethylene α-olefin copolymer, used to produce such films can be further characterized by any of the polymer properties listed above and in any combination. As a non-limiting example, the olefin polymer can have a MI of less than or equal to about 0.4, less than or equal to about 0.3, less than or equal to about 0.25, or less than or equal to about 0.2 g/10 min. Additionally or alternatively, the olefin polymer can have a density from about 0.91 to about 0.94, from about 0.915 to about 0.935, from about 0.913 to about 0.93, from about 0.917 to about 0.928, or from about 0.92 to about 0.928 g/cm3. Additionally or alternatively, the olefin polymer can be characterized by a HLMI in a range from about 3 to about 60, from about 4 to about 30, from about 4 to about 25, from about 4 to about 20, from about 5 to about 18, or from about 5 to about 15 g/10 min; and/or by a Mw/Mn in a range from about 6 to about 50, from about 8 to about 35, from about 10 to about 35, from about 12 to about 50, from about 14 to about 35, from about 6 to about 20, or from about 8 to about 16. In an embodiment, film products of this invention also can be characterized by relatively high haze and relatively low coefficient of friction (COF) properties, i.e., in the absence of any additives that might impact such measurements, for example, slip and antiblock additives. Representative blown films described herein (produced under LLDPE and/or HDPE conditions) can have a film haze of greater than or equal to about 55, greater than or equal to about 65, greater than or equal to about 75, greater than or equal to about 80, or greater than or equal to about 85%, and often the film haze can range up to 95-98%. Likewise, representative blown films described herein (produced under LLDPE and/or HDPE conditions) can have a kinetic COF in a range from about 0.3 to about 0.5, from about 0.3 to about 0.48, from about 0.32 to about 0.47, or from about 0.3 to about 0.42. In an embodiment, 1-mil blown films described herein (produced under LLDPE and/or HDPE conditions) can have a MD shrink at 250° F. in a range from about 20 to about 70, from about 35 to about 70, or from about 25 to about 65%. Other suitable ranges for MD shrink of the 1-mil film at 250° F. can include, but are not limited to, from about 27 to about 65%, from about 30 to about 60%, and the like. In another embodiment, blown films described herein (produced under LLDPE and/or HDPE conditions) can be characterized by the MD Elmendorf tear strength. Suitable ranges can include, but are not limited to, from about 10 to about 150, from about 25 to about 150, from about 50 to about 150, or from about 75 to about 150 g/mil. EXAMPLES The invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which are not to be construed in any way as imposing limitations to the scope of this invention. Various other aspects, embodiments, modifications, and equivalents thereof which, after reading the description herein, may suggest themselves to one of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit of the present invention or the scope of the appended claims. Melt index (MI, g/10 min) was determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 at 190° C. with a 2,160 gram weight. High load melt index (HLMI, g/10 min) was determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 at 190° C. with a 21,600 gram weight. Polymer density was determined in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm3) on a compression molded sample, cooled at about 15° C. per hour, and conditioned for about 40 hours at room temperature in accordance with ASTM D1505 and ASTM D4703. Molecular weights and molecular weight distributions were obtained using a PL-GPC 220 (Polymer Labs, an Agilent Company) system equipped with a IR4 detector (Polymer Char, Spain) and three Styragel HMW-6E GPC columns (Waters, MA) running at 145° C. The flow rate of the mobile phase 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) containing 0.5 g/L 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) was set at 1 mL/min, and polymer solution concentrations were in the range of 1.0-1.5 mg/mL, depending on the molecular weight. Sample preparation was conducted at 150° C. for nominally 4 hr with occasional and gentle agitation, before the solutions were transferred to sample vials for injection. An injection volume of about 200 μL was used. The integral calibration method was used to deduce molecular weights and molecular weight distributions using a Chevron Phillips Chemicals Company's HDPE polyethylene resin, MARLEX® BHB5003, as the broad standard. The integral table of the broad standard was pre-determined in a separate experiment with SEC-MALS. Mn is the number-average molecular weight, Mw is the weight-average molecular weight, Mz is the z-average molecular weight, and Mp is the peak molecular weight. Melt rheological characterizations were performed as follows. Small-strain (10%) oscillatory shear measurements were performed on a Rheometrics Scientific, Inc. ARES rheometer using parallel-plate geometry. All rheological tests were performed at 190° C. The complex viscosity |η*| versus frequency (ω) data were then curve fitted using the modified three parameter Carreau-Yasuda (CY) empirical model to obtain the zero shear viscosity—η0, characteristic viscous relaxation time—τη, and the breadth parameter—α. The simplified Carreau-Yasuda (CY) empirical model is as follows.  η * ( ω )  = η 0 [ 1 + ( τ η ⁢ ω ) a ] ( 1 - n ) / a , wherein: |η*(ω)|=magnitude of complex shear viscosity; η0=zero shear viscosity;τη=viscous relaxation time (Tau(η));α=“breadth” parameter (CY-a parameter);n=fixes the final power law slope, fixed at 2/11; andω=angular frequency of oscillatory shearing deformation. Details of the significance and interpretation of the CY model and derived parameters may be found in: C. A. Hieber and H. H. Chiang, Rheol. Acta, 28, 321 (1989); C. A. Hieber and H. H. Chiang, Polym. Eng. Sci., 32, 931 (1992); and R. B. Bird, R. C. Armstrong and O. Hasseger, Dynamics of Polymeric Liquids, Volume 1, Fluid Mechanics, 2nd Edition, John Wiley & Sons (1987); each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The long chain branches (LCB) per 1,000,000 total carbon atoms were calculated using the method of Janzen and Colby (J. Mol. Struct., 485/486, 569-584 (1999)), from values of zero shear viscosity, ηo (determined from the Carreau-Yasuda model, described hereinabove), and measured values of Mw obtained using a Dawn EOS multiangle light scattering detector (Wyatt). See also U.S. Pat. No. 8,114,946; J. Phys. Chem. 1980, 84, 649; and Y. Yu, D. C. Rohlfing, G. R Hawley, and P. J. DesLauriers, Polymer Preprints, 44, 49-50 (2003). These references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Short chain branch (SCB) content and short chain branching distribution (SCBD) across the molecular weight distribution were determined via an IR5-detected GPC system (IR5-GPC), wherein the GPC system was a PL220 GPC/SEC system (Polymer Labs, an Agilent company) equipped with three Styragel HMW-6E columns (Waters, Mass.) for polymer separation. A thermoelectric-cooled IR5 MCT detector (IR5) (Polymer Char, Spain) was connected to the GPC columns via a hot-transfer line. Chromatographic data were obtained from two output ports of the IR5 detector. First, the analog signal goes from the analog output port to a digitizer before connecting to Computer “A” for molecular weight determinations via the Cirrus software (Polymer Labs, now an Agilent Company) and the integral calibration method using a broad MWD HDPE Marlex™ BHB5003 resin (Chevron Phillips Chemical) as the broad molecular weight standard. The digital signals, on the other hand, go via a USB cable directly to Computer “B” where they are collected by a LabView data collection software provided by Polymer Char. Chromatographic conditions were set as follows: column oven temperature of 145° C.; flowrate of 1 mL/min; injection volume of 0.4 mL; and polymer concentration of about 2 mg/mL, depending on sample molecular weight. The temperatures for both the hot-transfer line and IRS detector sample cell were set at 150° C., while the temperature of the electronics of the IRS detector was set at 60° C. Short chain branching content was determined via an in-house method using the intensity ratio of CH3 (ICH3) to CH2 (ICH2) coupled with a calibration curve. The calibration curve was a plot of SCB content (xSCB) as a function of the intensity ratio of ICH3/ICH2. To obtain a calibration curve, a group of polyethylene resins (no less than 5) of SCB level ranging from zero to ca. 32 SCB/1,000 total carbons (SCB Standards) were used. All these SCB Standards have known SCB levels and flat SCBD profiles pre-determined separately by NMR and the solvent-gradient fractionation coupled with NMR (SGF-NMR) methods. Using SCB calibration curves thus established, profiles of short chain branching distribution across the molecular weight distribution were obtained for resins fractionated by the IR5-GPC system under exactly the same chromatographic conditions as for these SCB standards. A relationship between the intensity ratio and the elution volume was converted into SCB distribution as a function of MWD using a predetermined SCB calibration curve (i.e., intensity ratio of ICH3/ICH2 vs. SCB content) and MW calibration curve (i.e., molecular weight vs. elution time) to convert the intensity ratio of ICH3/ICH2 and the elution time into SCB content and the molecular weight, respectively. Pilot plant polymerizations were conducted in a 23-gallon slurry loop reactor at a production rate of approximately 25 pounds of polymer per hour. Polymerization runs were carried out under continuous particle form process conditions in a loop reactor (also known as a slurry process) by contacting a dual metallocene solution in isobutane, an organoaluminum solution, and an activator-support in a 1-L stirred autoclave with continuous output to the loop reactor. The organoaluminum and dual metallocene solutions were fed as separate streams into a tee upstream of the autoclave where they contacted each other. The activator-support was flushed with isobutane into a tee between the aforementioned tee and the autoclave, contacting the organoaluminum/metallocene mixture just before entering the autoclave. The isobutane flush used to transport the activator-support into the autoclave was set at a rate that would result in a residence time of approximately 25 minutes in the autoclave. The total flow from the autoclave then entered the loop reactor. Ethylene used was polymerization grade ethylene which was purified through a column of alumina (activated at 250° C. in nitrogen). 1-Hexene was polymerization grade 1-hexene (obtained from Chevron Phillips Chemical Company) which was purified by nitrogen purging and storage over 13-X molecular sieve activated at 250° C. (482° F.) in nitrogen. The loop reactor was a liquid full, 15.2 cm diameter, loop reactor, having a volume of 23 gallons (87 liters). Liquid isobutane was used as the diluent. Hydrogen was added to regulate the molecular weight and/or HLMI of the polymer product. The isobutane was polymerization grade isobutane (obtained from Chevron Phillips Chemical Company) that was further purified by distillation and subsequently passed through a column of alumina (activated at 250° C. in nitrogen). Reactor conditions included a pressure around 580 psi (4 MPa), and a temperature that was varied from about 70° C. (158° F.) to about 100° C. (212° F.) as indicated in the examples. Also, the reactor was operated to have a residence time of about 1.25 hr. Metallocene concentrations in the reactor were within a range of about 1 to 2 parts per million (ppm) of the diluent in the polymerization reactor. Polymer was removed from the reactor at the rate of about 25 lb/hr and recovered in a flash chamber. A Vulcan dryer was used to dry the polymer under nitrogen at about 60-80° C. Cocatalyst tri-isobutylaluminum (TIBA, obtained from Akzo Corporation) was also used. The cocatalyst was obtained as a one molar solution in heptane, but was further diluted to 1 weight percent. The cocatalyst was added in a concentration in a range of from about 50 to 60 parts per million of the diluent in the polymerization reactor. To prevent static buildup of the reactor, a small amount (less than 5 ppm, by weight, of diluent) of a commercial antistatic agent sold as “Stadis 450” was added as needed. Metallocene A was rac-ethylene-bis(indenyl) zirconium dichloride, and Metallocene B was diphenylmethylidene{η5-[3-(penten-4-yl)cyclopentadien-1-ylidene]} [η5-(2,7-di-tert-butylfluoren-9-ylidene)]zirconium dichloride. Fluorided silica-coated aluminas were prepared as follows. Alumina A, from W.R. Grace Company, was impregnated to incipient wetness was first calcined in dry air at about 600° C. for approximately 6 hours, cooled to ambient temperature, and then contacted with tetraethylorthosilicate in isopropanol to equal 25 wt. % SiO2. After drying, the silica-coated alumina was calcined at 600° C. for 3 hours. Fluorided silica-coated alumina (7 wt. % F) was prepared by impregnating the calcined silica-coated alumina with an ammonium bifluoride solution in methanol, drying, and then calcining for 3 hours at 600° C. (unless otherwise noted) in dry air. Afterward, the fluorided silica-coated alumina was collected and stored under dry nitrogen, and was used without exposure to the atmosphere. Some of the blown film samples were made on a laboratory-scale blown film line using typical linear low density polyethylene conditions (LLDPE) as follows: 100 mm (4 inch) die diameter, 1.5 mm (0.060 inch) die gap, 37.5 mm (1.5 inch) diameter single-screw extruder fitted with a barrier screw with a Maddock mixing section at the end (L/D=24, 2.2:1 compression ratio), about 27 kg/hr (60 lb/hr) output rate, 2.5:1 blow-up ratio (BUR), “in-pocket” bubble with a “frost line height” (FLH) of about 28 cm (11 inch), 190° C. (375° F.) barrel and die set temperatures, and 1 mil (25 micron) film and 3 mil (75 micron) film. Cooling was accomplished with a Dual Lip air ring using ambient (laboratory) air at about 25° C. (75-80° F.). These particular processing conditions were chosen because the film properties so obtained are typically representative of those obtained from larger, commercial scale film blowing conditions. Other blown film samples were made on the same film line, but under high density polyethylene conditions (HDPE). Typically, the copolymer was blown into a 1 mil film on a 2-inch die, with a 35-mil die gap, at 205° C./220° C. barrel/die set temperatures, at a rate of 28-30 lb/hr, with a 4:1 blow-up ratio, and a 14 inch frost line height. Dart impact strength was measured in accordance with ASTM D-1709 (method A). Machine (MD) and transverse (TD) direction Elmendorf tear strengths were measured on a Testing Machines Inc. tear tester (Model 83-11-00) in accordance with ASTM D-1922. Film haze was determined in accordance with ASTM D1003, film-to-film coefficient of friction (COF) was determined in accordance with ASTM D1894, film shrink properties were determined in accordance with ASTM D2732, and Spencer Impact was determined in accordance with ASTM D3420. Examples 1-9 Example 1 was a broad monomodal LLDPE film resin, having a nominal 0.2 melt index and 0.924 density, commercially available from Chevron-Phillips Chemical Company LP. Each of Examples 2-9 utilized a dual catalyst system containing a two carbon bridged, zirconium based metallocene compound containing two indenyl groups (Metallocene A) and a single atom bridged, zirconium based metallocene compound containing a cyclopentadienyl and a fluorenyl group (Metallocene B). In Example 2, bimodal polymer was produced in the reactor described above using a solution containing Metallocenes A and B at an A:B weight ratio of 8:1. The total metallocene concentration in the reactor was 0.8 ppm by weight, and the activator-support (fluorided silica-coated alumina, described above) was fed to the reactor at the rate of approximately 0.25 lb per hour, to achieve a yield of about 2000 lb polymer per lb of the fluorided silica-coated alumina Triisobutylaluminum was fed to the reactor to maintain a concentration of 50 ppm by weight in the isobutane. 1-Hexene was added to the reactor to maintain a concentration of about 2.5 mol %, and ethylene was added to maintain a concentration of about 12 mol % (based on the isobutane diluent). About 4.5 mlb of hydrogen were added to the reactor per hour. Reactor temperature was set at 79-80° C., the reactor residence time was about 1.2 hr, and the reactor % solids were 29.4-30.3%. Examples 3-9 were produced in the same manner as Example 2, generally at 11.4-12.4 mol % ethylene and 2.5-2.9 mol % 1-hexene, and with the following different amounts of the metallocene catalysts: Example 3 (1.12 ppm of metallocenes at a 12:1 weight ratio of A:B), Example 4 (0.92 ppm of metallocenes at a 8:1 weight ratio of A:B), Example 5 (1.02 ppm of metallocenes at a 20:1 weight ratio of A:B), Example 6 (1.6 ppm of metallocenes at a 20:1 weight ratio of A:B), Example 7 (0.83 ppm of metallocenes at a 20:1 weight ratio of A:B), Example 8 (0.79 ppm of metallocenes at a 20:1 weight ratio of A:B), and Example 9 (0.66 ppm of metallocenes at a 30:1 weight ratio of A:B) Table I summarizes the polymer properties of Examples 1-9. For instance, the polymers of Examples 2-7 exhibited a unique combination of density, Mw/Mn, HLMI, LCB content, and SCB distribution. The broad molecular weight distribution and reverse comonomer distribution of the polymers produced using the dual metallocene-based catalyst systems disclosed herein are illustrated in FIGS. 1-8 for the polymers of Examples 2-9, respectively (e.g., there are relatively more short chain branches (SCB) at the higher molecular weights; assumes 2 methyl chain ends (CE)). In FIGS. 1-8, the number of SCB per 1000 total carbon (TC) atoms of the polymer at Mz (or Mw) is greater than at Mn. Table II summarizes the properties of the lower molecular weight (LMW) component and the higher molecular weight (HMW) component of the polymers of Examples 2-8. The respective LMW and HMW component properties were determined by deconvoluting the molecular weight distribution (see FIGS. 1-8) of each polymer. The relative amounts of the LMW and HMW components (area percentages) in the polymer, and Mp of the LMW component and Mp of the HMW component, were determined using a commercial software program (Systat Software, Inc., Peak FitTM v. 4.05). The other molecular weight parameters for the LMW and HMW components (e.g., Mn, Mw, Mz, etc., of each component) were determined by using the deconvoluted data from the Peak Fit™ program, and applying a Schulz-Flory distribution mathematical function and a Gaussian peak fit, as generally described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,300,983, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The ratios of the Mp of the HMW component to the Mp of the LMW component for the polymers of Examples 2-8 were in the 7:1 to 15:1 range. The LCB of the polymers of Examples 2-9 were determined using Janzen-Colby method, as described herein. The LCB of the HMW component was determined by first producing a polymer using Metallocene B alone at conditions suitable to produce a polymer having a molecular weight (Mw) in the 100-125 kg/mol range, and then determining the LCB content using the Janzen-Colby method. The LCB of the LMW component was likewise determined by first producing a polymer using Metallocene A alone at conditions suitable to produce a polymer having a Mw in the 100-125 kg/mol range, and then determining the LCB content using the Janzen-Colby method. The polymerization runs used to produce these polymers were conducted in a one-gallon stainless steel reactor with 1.8 L of isobutane. About 1 mmol triisobutylaluminum, 100 mg of fluorided silica-coated alumina, and 3 mg of the respective metallocene compound were added in that order through a charge port while slowly venting isobutane vapor. The charge port was closed and isobutane was added. The contents of the reactor were stirred and heated to the polymerization temperature of 80° C., and ethylene and 40 mL of 1-hexene were then introduced into the reactor. Ethylene was fed on demand to maintain the target pressure of 400 psig pressure for the 30 min length of the polymerization run. If needed, hydrogen was added with the ethylene feed to produce a polymer with a Mw in the 100-125 kg/mol range. The reactor was maintained at the desired temperature throughout the run by an automated heating-cooling system. Using Metallocene A, polymers were produced at a Mw of 110 kg/mol and at a Mw of 112 kg/mol, and these polymers had 12.4 and 12.3 LCB, respectively, per million carbon atoms. Using Metallocene B, polymers were produced at a Mw of 107 kg/mol and at 122 kg/mol, and both polymers had 1.1 LCB per million carbon atoms. Hence, the ratio of the number of LCB of the LMW component to the number of LCB of the HMW component, per million total carbon atoms, was about 11:1. Blown films were produced under the HDPE conditions provided hereinabove at an output rate of 28-30 lb/hr and a melt temperature of 191-192° C. In Table III, blown films labeled with an “A” were made without a polymer processing aid (e.g., Example 3A), while those labeled with a “B” were made with 400-800 ppm of a polymer processing aid (e.g., Example 3B). Gels were measured using an automated camera-based gel counting machine made by Optical Control System (OCS), Model FS-5. The system consisted of a light source and a detector. The film was passed through the system, between the light source and the detector, with a 150 mm (6 inch) inspection width. A total of 10 square meters of film area was inspected and the gels with sizes less than or greater than 200 microns were analyzed. The numbers in the table represent the numbers of each category of gel sizes counted per square foot. Films made from the polymers of Examples 2-6, as shown in Table III, exhibited a unique combination of dart impact strength, MD tear strength, haze, COF, and shrink properties. In particular, the films made from the polymers of Examples 2-6 had dart impact strengths 3-7 times greater than that of the film produced from the polymer of Example 1, as well as a better balance of MD tear strength and TD tear strength. Blown films were produced under the LLDPE conditions provided hereinabove at an output rate of about 27 kg/hr (60 lb/hr) and a melt temperature of 179-184° C., except for Example 2, which was produced at an output rate of 45-48 lb/hr due to pressure limitations. In Tables IV-V, blown films with an “A” were made without a polymer processing aid (e.g., Example 3A), while those with a “B” were made with 400-800 ppm of a polymer processing aid (e.g., Example 3B). Films made from the polymers of Examples 2-8, as shown in Table IV, exhibited a unique combination of dart impact strength, MD tear strength, haze, COF, and shrink properties.
