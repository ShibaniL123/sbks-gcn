In human hearing, hair cells in the cochlea respond to sound waves and produce corresponding auditory nerve impulses. These nerve impulses are then conducted to the brain and perceived as sound. Hearing loss, which may be due to many different causes, is generally of two types: conductive and sensorineural. Conductive hearing loss typically occurs where the normal mechanical pathways for sound to reach the hair cells in the cochlea are impeded, for example, from damage to the ossicles. Conductive hearing loss may often be helped by using conventional hearing aids that amplify sounds so that acoustic information can reach the cochlea and the hair cells. Some types of conductive hearing loss are also treatable by surgical procedures. Many people who are profoundly deaf, however, have sensorineural hearing loss. This type of hearing loss can arise from the absence or the destruction of the hair cells in the cochlea which then no longer transduce acoustic signals into auditory nerve impulses. Individuals with sensorineural hearing loss may be unable to derive significant benefit from conventional hearing aid systems alone, no matter how loud the acoustic stimulus is. This is because the natural mechanism for transducing sound energy into auditory nerve impulses has been damaged. Thus, in the absence of properly functioning hair cells, auditory nerve impulses cannot be generated directly from sounds. To overcome sensorineural deafness, cochlear implant systems, or cochlear prostheses, have been developed that can bypass the hair cells located in the cochlea by presenting electrical stimulation directly to the auditory nerve fibers. This leads to the perception of sound in the brain and provides at least partial restoration of hearing function. Most of these cochlear prosthesis systems treat sensorineural deficit by stimulating the ganglion cells in the cochlea directly using an implanted electrode or lead that has an electrode array. Thus, a cochlear prosthesis operates by directly stimulating the auditory nerve cells, bypassing the defective cochlear hair cells that normally transduce acoustic energy into electrical activity in the connected auditory nerve cells. The implantation of the cochlear prosthesis involves the insertion of an electrode array into the cochlea of the patient. The interior structures of the cochlea can be delicate and sensitive to forces generated by the insertion of the electrode array. Minimizing trauma to the cochlea during implantation improves patient outcomes and preserves residual hearing.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION As mentioned above, individuals with hearing loss can be assisted by a number of hearing devices, including cochlear implants. The invention relates to a cochlear implant as defined in claim 1 and to a method for forming a lead body to be used with such a cochlear implant as defined in claim 14. The cochlear implant includes a cochlear lead that is to be surgically implanted into the patient. The distal portion of the lead contains a number of electrodes that and to electrically stimulate the auditory nerve system. This electrode array is typically constructed out of biocompatible silicone, platinum-iridium wires, and platinum electrodes. To place the lead of a cochlear implant, the distal (or apical) portion of a cochlear lead is pushed through an opening into the cochlea. To reduce trauma and hearing loss, it is desirable that the cochlear lead be inserted into the patient with minimal force and reduced contact with the interior structures in the cochlea. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present systems and methods. As used in the specification and appended claims, the term "distal" refers to portions or components that are farther away from the cochlear implant processor and the surgeon when implanting the cochlear device. The term "proximal" refers to portions or components that are closer to the processor and/or the surgeon when implanting the cochlear device. In use, the cochlear electrode array delivers electrical current into the fluids and tissues immediately surrounding the individual electrode contacts to create transient potential gradients that, if sufficiently strong, cause the nearby auditory nerve fibers to generate action potentials. The auditory nerve fibers branch from cell bodies located in the spiral ganglion, which lies in the modiolus, adjacent to the inside wall of the scala tympani. The density of electrical current flowing through volume conductors such as tissues and fluids tends to be highest near the electrode contact that is the source of the current. Consequently, stimulation at one contact site tends to selectively activate those spiral ganglion cells and their auditory nerve fibers that are closest to that electrode. Fig. 1 is a diagram showing an illustrative cochlear implant system (100) having a cochlear implant (300) with an electrode array (195) that is surgically placed within the patient's cochlea (150). Ordinarily, sound enters the external ear, or pinna, (110) and is directed into the auditory canal (120) where the sound wave vibrates the tympanic membrane (130). The motion of the tympanic membrane (130) is amplified and transmitted through the ossicular chain (140), which includes three bones in the middle ear. The third bone of the ossicular chain (140), the stapes (145), contacts the outer surface of the cochlea (150) and causes movement of the fluid within the cochlea (150). Cochlear hair cells respond to the fluid-borne vibration in the cochlea (150) and trigger neural electrical signals that are conducted from the cochlea to the auditory cortex by the auditory nerve (160). As indicated above, the cochlear implant (200, 300) is a surgically implanted electronic device that provides a sense of sound to a person who is profoundly deaf or severely hard of hearing. The cochlear implant (200, 300) operates by direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve cells, bypassing the defective cochlear hair cells that normally transduce acoustic energy into electrical energy. External components (200) of the cochlear implant system can include a Behind-The-Ear (BTE) unit (175), which contains the sound processor and has a microphone (170), a cable (177), and a transmitter (180). The microphone (170) picks up sound from the environment and converts it into electrical impulses. The sound processor within the BTE unit (175) selectively filters and manipulates the electrical impulses and sends the processed electrical signals through the cable (177) to the transmitter (180). The transmitter (180) receives the processed electrical signals from the processor and transmits them to the implanted antenna (187) by electromagnetic transmission. The internal components (300) include an internal processor (185), an antenna (187), and a cochlear lead (190) having an electrode array (195) at its distal end. The internal processor (185) and antenna (187) are secured beneath the user's skin, typically above and behind the external ear (110). The antenna (187) receives signals and power from the transmitter (180). The internal processor (185) receives these signals and performs one or more operations on the signals to generate modified signals. These modified signals are then sent along a number of signal wires that pass through the cochlear lead (190) and are individually connected to the electrodes in the electrode array (195). The electrode array (195) is implanted within the cochlea (150) and provides electrical stimulation to the auditory nerve (160). The cochlear implant (300) stimulates different portions of the cochlea (150) according to the frequencies detected by the microphone (170), just as a normal functioning ear would experience stimulation at different portions of the cochlea depending on the frequency of sound vibrating the liquid within the cochlea (150). This allows the brain to interpret the frequency of the sound as if the hair cells of the basilar membrane were functioning properly. Fig. 2 is an illustrative diagram showing a more detailed view of the external components (200) of a cochlear implant system. External components (200) of the cochlear implant system include a BTE unit (175), which comprises a microphone (170), an ear hook (210), a sound processor (220), and a battery (230), which may be rechargeable. The microphone (170) picks up sound from the environment and converts it into electrical impulses. The sound processor (220) selectively filters and manipulates the electrical impulses and sends the processed electrical signals through a cable (177) to the transmitter (180). A number of controls (240, 245) adjust the operation of the processor (220). These controls may include a volume switch (240) and program selection switch (245). The transmitter (180) receives the processed electrical signals from the processor (220) and transmits these electrical signals and power from the battery (230) to the cochlear implant (300) by electromagnetic transmission. Fig. 3 is an illustrative diagram showing a cochlear implant (300), including an internal processor (185), an antenna (187), and a cochlear lead (190) having an electrode array (195). The cochlear implant (300) is surgically implanted such that the electrode array (195) is internal to the cochlea, as shown in Fig. 1. The internal processor (185) and antenna (187) are secured beneath the user's skin, typically above and behind the external ear (110), with the cochlear lead (190) connecting the internal processor (185) to the electrode array (195) within the cochlea. As discussed above, the antenna (187) receives signals from the transmitter (180) and sends the signals to the internal processor (185). The internal processor (185) modifies the signals and passes them along the appropriate wires to activate one or more of the electrodes within the electrode array (195). This provides the user with sensory input that is a representation of external sound waves sensed by the microphone (170). Fig. 4 is a diagram of implanted components (300) of a cochlear implant. As discussed above, the implanted components (300) include an antenna (187) and a processor (185). In the center of the antenna (405) is a magnet (405) that is designed to center and hold the transmitter (180, Fig. 1) in place. The antenna (187), magnet (405), and processor (185) are encapsulated by by an overcoat (410). The cochlear lead (190) includes a lead body (192) and an electrode array (195). The lead body (192) mechanically and electrically connects the electrode array (195) to the processor (185). In this implementation, the lead body (192) includes a first larger diameter tube (435) and a second smaller diameter tube (445). The length of the lead body (192) may vary according to the cochlear implant design, surgical procedure, and patient. For example, the lead body (192) may have a length of 70 to 100 millimeters. In one specific implementation, the lead body (192) has a length of about 85 millimeters measured from the processor overmolding (410) to the flexible body (470). Helically coiled wires (420, 430) pass through the large and small diameter tubes (435, 445). Helically coiled signal wires (430) electrically connect the electrode array (195) to the processor (185). A second helically coiled wire (420) connects the processor (185) to a ring electrode (425) located around the large diameter tube (435). The second helically coiled wire (420) may have a variety of configurations. For example the second helically coiled wire (420) may be formed from nine strand twisted or braided platinum wire coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The ring electrode (425) can be used as a common ground or for Neural Response Imaging (NRI) for the processor (185) and its internal electronics. The signal wires (430) carry voltage pulses to the active electrodes in the electrode array (195). The large diameter tube (435) extends out of the strain relief (415). In some cases the tube (435) may extend through the strain relief (415) to the processor (185). The second smaller diameter tube (445) is mechanically connected to the large diameter tube (435) by placing a portion of the small diameter tube (445) inside the large diameter tube (435) and creating a tapered transition (440) between the two tubes. The small diameter tube (445) is mechanically connected to the flexible body (470) by placing a transition tube (450) into the interior of the small diameter tube (445). The transition tube (450) is molded into the flexible body (140). In one example, the transition tube (450) has a Shore A hardness of 70. Figs. 5, 6, and 7 show up close views of portions of the implanted components (300) illustrated in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows the proximal portion (460) of the lead body. Fig. 6 shows the transition portion (465) between the large diameter tube (435), the small diameter tube (445), transition tube (450) and the flexible body (470). Fig. 7 shows the distal end of the small diameter tube (445), the transition tube (450) and the electrode array (195). Now referring to Fig. 5, a proximal portion (460) of the lead body includes the large diameter tube (435) that has an outer diameter which is less than 2 millimeters in diameter. In one implementation, the large diameter tube (435) may have an outside diameter of between 1 to 2 millimeters and an inside diameter of between 0.5 and 1 millimeters. For example, the large diameter tube may have an outside diameter of approximately 1.25 millimeters and an inside diameter of approximately 0.7 millimeters. The large diameter tube (435) may be formed from a variety of flexible biocompatible materials. In this implementation, the large diameter tube (435) is formed from silicone with a Shore A hardness of approximately 30 to 70. The dimensions given above and other dimensions of flexible materials in the specification are nominal unstressed dimensions. When placed under stress, biocompatible elastomeric polymers such as silicone have the capacity to stretch, compress or otherwise conform. For example, a silicone tube within an unstressed inside diameter of 0.7 millimeters may be placed over an object with a diameter that is greater than 0.7 millimeters. The silicone tube expands to accommodate the larger object and the stretched inside diameter of the silicone tube is greater than 0.7 millimeters. The large diameter tube (435) is molded into the strain relief (415), which secures the large diameter tube (435) to the processor (185, Fig. 4). As discussed above, the signal wires (430) pass from the processor, into the large diameter tube (435) and through its length. The ground wire (420) is also helically coiled and passes through the center of the helically coiled signal wires (430). In one case, the ground wire (420) is a multi-strand wire. The ground wire (420) passes out of an opening in the sidewall of the large diameter tube (435) and is electrically connected to the extra-cochlear ring electrode (425) disposed over the large diameter tube (435). As discussed above, the ring electrode (425) serves as a ground for the processor and its internal electronics. The ground wire (420) connects the ring electrode to the processor (185, Fig. 4). Because the ring electrode (425) serves as the ground for all of the electrodes, ground wire (420) may need to carry a substantial amount of current. Consequently, the ground wire (420) may be significantly larger in diameter than the signal wires. To reduce the stiffness of the larger diameter ground wire (420) it may be multi-strand and formed into a helix. The strain relief (415) is molded over the large diameter tube (435) and secures it to the processor (185, Fig. 4). The large diameter tube (435) is backfilled with silicone to encapsulate the signal wire bundle (430) and ground wire (420). Silicone may be used to form tapers (427) on either side of the ring electrode (425). The tapers (427) may provide a number of advantages, include smoothing the profile of the large diameter tube (435), securing the ring electrode (425) in place and reducing the potential for kinking of the large diameter tube (435). Fig. 6 shows the small diameter tube (445) joining the large diameter tube (435) to the transition tube (450). In one implementation, the small diameter tube (445) is formed from silicone with a Shore A hardness between 50 and 70 and has an outside diameter larger than the inside diameter of the large diameter tube (435). For example, the small diameter tube (445) may have an outside diameter of 0.75 millimeters, an inside diameter of 0.35 millimeters, and a Shore A hardness of 70. When the small diameter tube (445) is placed within the large diameter tube (435), the large diameter tube (435) compresses the small diameter tube (445) and holds it securely in place. In one example, the overlap (442) between the large diameter tube (435) and the small diameter tube (445) is at least 1 millimeter. When silicone is injected into the tubes, it flows through the overlapping portion and forms an additional bond between the large diameter tube (435) and the small diameter tube (445). A tapered transition (440) between the large diameter tube (435) and the small diameter tube (445) can be formed using silicone which cures to a Shore A hardness of approximately 25. This tapered transition (440) can serve a number of purposes, including smoothing the transition between the large diameter tube (435) and the small diameter tube (445), sealing the joint, and stiffening the joint. The transition can also ensure that there are no stress concentrations and undesirable bending or kinking near the joint. The other end of the small diameter tube (445) passes over the transition tube (450). As described above, the transition tube (450) is molded into the flexible body (470). In one case, the transition tube (450) has an outside diameter less than 1 millimeter and inside diameter of less than 0.5 millimeters. For example, the transition tube (450) may have an outside diameter of 0.65 millimeters and an inside diameter of 0.30 millimeters. The small diameter tube (445) has an inside diameter which is smaller than the outside diameter of the transition tube (450). Consequently, when the small diameter tube (445) is placed over the transition tube (450), the inside diameter of the smaller diameter tube (445) expands to pass over the outside diameter of the transition tube (450). The outside diameter of the transition tube (450) may also shrink from the pressure of the small diameter tube (445). Consequently, the small diameter tube (445) securely grips the transition tube (450). The overlap (452) between the small diameter tube (445) and the transition tube (450) is approximately 1 millimeter. This leaves an exposed portion (454) of the transition tube with a length of approximately 3 millimeters or less. The signal wires (430) pass straight through transition tube (450) and into flexible body (470). The small diameter tube (445) is backfilled with silicone to secure the helical signal wires (430) in place. In one example, the silicone backfill is liquid silicone that cures with a Shore A hardness of 25. Fig. 7 is a side view of the distal end of the small diameter tube (445), the transition tube (450) and the flexible body (470). As discussed above, the electrode array (195) includes a number of electrodes (475) disposed along the length of the flexible body (470). The electrode array (195) may also include several markers (480, 485) and/or non-active electrodes that serve as radio opaque markers to verify the position of the electrode array (195) in the cochlea. Each of the signal wires (430) terminates at one of the electrodes (475). Individual voltage signals representing sounds are transmitted along the various signal wires (430) to the appropriate electrodes. The voltage from the electrodes (475) stimulates nearby neurons. In this example, there are 16 active electrodes in the electrode array. Consequently, there are at least 16 signal wires. A number of additional wires may also be included in the signal wires (430). In this illustrative case, there are 18 signal wires. The flexible body (470) mechanically joins the components of the electrode array (195) together while allowing for the electrode array to bend to accommodate the insertion process and to adapt to the unique geometry of a patient's cochlea. For example, the flexible body (470) may be formed from a silicon overmolding that encapsulates the electrodes (475), signal wires (430), and the transition tube (450). The flexible body (470) may also include a number of molded features such as a lumen (455) and markers (480, 485). The lumen (455) is a cavity into which a stylet can be placed to guide the electrode array (195) into the desired position within the cochlea. The lumen (455) can have a variety of lengths and diameters. In this example, the lumen (455) extends past the most distal electrode in the electrode array (195). The proximal end of the lumen (455) is reinforced with a polytetrafluoroethylene tube. The lumen (455) is offset from small diameter tube (445) and transition tube (450). For example, the lumen (455) may be offset from the transition tube (450) by approximately 0.5 millimeters. Fig. 8 is a diagram of the internal components (300) surgically implanted into a patient. The antenna (187) and the processor (185) are positioned beneath the skin of the patient. In some examples, a facial recess (495) can be formed in the mastoid bone (490) to reduce the profile of the processor and secure it in place. The electrode array (195) is placed into the cochlea and the lead body (435, 445) is coiled into position within the facial cavity (495) in the mastoid bone (490). As discussed above, the cochlear lead (190) is designed to be flexible and have a small cross section. This allows the surgeon to position the cochlear lead (190) using little force. The flexibility of the cochlear lead (190) also allows it to more easily be retained in place because is generates little restoring spring force after deflection. The reduced spring forces may allow for better bio-adaptation of the surrounding tissues. In some cases, the surgeon may suture and/or pack the surrounding tissues into the facial recess (495) formed in the mastoid (490). Securing the cochlear lead (190) significantly contributes to the stability of the electrode array (195) within the cochlea. Further, because the cochlear lead (190) is flexible enough to be coiled within the facial recess (495), the surgeon has significant flexibility in routing the lead body and positioning the cochlear electrode. Further, the curvature and flexibility of the cochlear lead (190) mechanically decouples exterior forces and deflections from the electrode array (195). For example, an external impact to the head of the patient in the area of the processor (185) would not ordinarily lead to a shift in the position in the electrode array (195) because of the flexibility and curvature of the cochlear lead (190). The curvature of the cochlear lead may (190) primarily occur in the large diameter tube (435), with the overlap joint (442) between the large diameter tube (435) and small diameter tube (445) remaining relatively straight. Because of the dual wall thickness at the overlap joint (442), the joint may be somewhat stiffer than the large diameter tube (435) or the small diameter tube (445). The tapered transition between the overlap joint (442) and the small diameter tube (445) reduces kinking of the tubes near the overlap joint (442). The more flexible small diameter tube (445) bends toward the cochlea to allow for reduced stresses after the electrode array (195) is placed in the cochlea. Fig. 9 is a flow chart of an illustrative method (900) for forming a lead body of a cochlear lead. The method includes wrapping signal wires around a mandrel to form first helix (step 905). For example, the first helix may be formed by wrapping the signal wires around a 0.3 mm to 0.5 mm mandrel with a 1-2 miiiimeter pitch. A free end of the signal wires is attached to a pilot wire (step 910). The small diameter silicone tube is placed over the pilot wire and the first helix (step 915) and liquid silicone is injected into the small diameter tube to encapsulate the first helix (step 920). The next portion of the signal wires is wrapped to form a second helix having a larger helical diameter than the first helix (step 925). For example, the signal wires may be wound with a 1-2 millimeter pitch around a mandrel with a diameter of 0.5 millimeters to 0.7 millimeters. A large diameter tube is placed over the second helix and at 1 to 2 millimeters of the small diameter tube (step 930). A ring electrode is placed over an outer surface of the large diameter tube (step 935). Continuing with the flowchart at the top of Fig. 9B, to connect the ring electrode to the processor, an opening is formed in the wall of the large diameter tube (step 940) and a ground wire that has previously been formed into a helix is threaded through the center of the second helix in the large tube and out of the opening (step 945). The ground wire is electrically connected to the ring electrode (step 950). For example, the ground wire may be laser welded or resistance welded to the ring electrode. Silicone is injected into the large diameter tube to encapsulate the wires (step 955). A tapered transition is formed between the small diameter tube and the large diameter tube (step 957). For example, liquid silicone could be deposited over the joint, shaped, and cured. The signal wires and ground wire are electrically connected to the processor and the processor and the proximal portion of the large diameter tube are overmolded to form the strain relief and processor overmold (step 960). The steps described above are only illustrative examples. The steps in the method may be combined, eliminated, reordered, or additional steps may be added. The order in which the steps are presented may be changed. For example, the steps of forming an opening the wall of the large diameter tube and threading the ground wire spiral through the large diameter tube could be performed in reverse order. Examples of additional steps include forming tapering transitions between the ring electrode and the outer surface of the large diameter tube. In sum, flexural geometries in wires between electrodes in a cochlear electrode array reduce the tendency of the electrode array to uncoil/open after molding. This reduces the amount of encapsulation material on the apical portion of the electrode array and allows the electrode array to be produced using a single shot mold. The thinner electrode array can be more easily inserted into a mid-scalar position with reduced trauma to the cochlea. The preceding description has been presented only to illustrate and describe examples of the principles described. This description is not intended to be exhaustive.
