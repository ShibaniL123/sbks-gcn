Further the present invention relates to a composition, preferably a slave composition, more preferably a liquid crystalline composition, comprising at least one dichroic dye (I) as described above within the given preferences, and at least one slave material, preferably a liquid crystal material or a polymerizable liquid crystal. In the context of the present application, a "slave material" shall refer to any material that has the capability to establish anisotropy upon contact with an aligned material, preferably photo- aligned material. The nature of the anisotropy in the aligned material and in the slave material may be different from each other. For example, the slave material may exhibit light absorption anisotropy for visible light and therefore can act as a polarizer, whereas the anisotropy of the aligned material may only be related to the molecular orientation. A slave material may comprise polymerizable and/or non-polymerizable compounds. Within the context of the present application the terms "polymerizable" and "polymerized" shall include the meaning of "cross-linkable" and "cross-linked", respectively. Likewise, "polymerization" shall include the meaning of "cross-linking". Preferably, the slave material is a self-organizing material. More preferred is that the slave material is a liquid crystal material and in particular preferred is that the slave material is a liquid crystal polymer material. In the context of the present application, a "slave composition" shall refer to a composition comprising a slave material. Polymerizable liquid crystals (LCP) which are present in the inventive compositions are well known to the skilled person e.g. from EP 0331233 , WO 95/24454, US 5,567,349, US 5,650,534, WO 00/041 10, WO 00/07975, WO 00/48985, WO 00/551 10, WO 00/63154 and WO 201 1003846. For adjustment of liquid crystalline properties and suppression of crystallization, mixtures of two or more LCP components may be used. At least one of the LCP components may optionally comprise more than one polymerizable group in the chemical structure in order to achieve cross-linking. As an alternative or to improve cross- linking abilities the addition of isotropic compounds comprising two or more polymerizable groups, so called cross-linkers, may also be possible. Furthermore well -known additives such as, e.g. phenol derivatives for stabilization and photoinitiators such as, e.g. Irgacure® may also be present in the inventive mixture. The number of dichroic dyes of formula (I) present in the composition may depend mainly on the spectral working range of the polarizer and on the solubility of the dyes. Colored polarizers, which are absorbing in a selective spectral range or the whole visible range may preferably be achieved by the presence of one or more dyes in the composition. Preferred composition of the invention consequently comprise at least one polymerizable dichroic dye according to the general formula (I), at least one polymerizable liquid crystal and optionally additives, such as cross-linkers, stabilizers and photoinitiator. Particularly preferred are compositions comprising one to four dichroic dyes of formula (I) and at least one polymerizable liquid crystal and optionally additives such as cross-linkers, stabilizers and photoinitiators. In a further embodiment the compositions of the invention may comprise in addition another dichroic or non-dichroic dye, which resulting mixture may be used as a dichroic dye of a desired color hue. No limitation is imposed in this context. The total content of dichroic dyes of formula (I) in the inventive composition may depend on different factors such as solubility in the LCP host, influence on the liquid crystalline properties (e.g. depression of clearing point) and absorption ability (extinction) of the dyes involved. Preferred dye concentrations may be in the range of 0.1 to 50 wt %, more preferably from 0.5 to 30 wt %, most preferably from 0.5 to 20 wt %. The dichroic dyes (I) according to the invention are also of value in the manufacture of dyed cholesteric layers. When added to a cholesteric mixture the dichroic dyes according to the invention are able to contribute to the enhancement of special color effects and therefore their further use in the formation of dyed cholesteric devices is an additional and valuable asset. Thus in a preferred embodiment, compositions of the invention as described hereinabove may further comprise at least one chiral polymerizable liquid crystalline compound or at least one chiral component, to induce a cholesteric phase for the creation of dyed cholesteric layers. In a further aspect the invention also provides the use of said composition for the preparation of a dichroic polymer network, a dichroic liquid crystalline polymer film (LCP film) or a dichroic liquid crystalline polymer gel. In addition, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a dichroic polymer network, a dichroic liquid crystalline polymer film (LCP film) or a dichroic liquid crystalline polymer gel, which process comprises polymerizing a dichroic dye or a composition of the present invention. Thus, in a further aspect the invention provides a dichroic polymer network, a dichroic liquid crystalline polymer film (LCP film) or a dichroic liquid crystalline polymer gel comprising dichroic dyes and/or compositions according to the present invention. Such dichroic polymer network, a dichroic liquid crystalline polymer film (LCP film) or a dichroic liquid crystalline polymer gel may readily be prepared by UV or thermal polymerization of the mixtures of the present invention. A film comprising a composition according to the present invention is formed on a substrate, for example, by first preparing a solution of a composition, which is subsequently applied to a support by different coating techniques, such as spin coating, dip coating, meniscus coating, wire coating, slot coating, offset printing, inkjet printing, flexo printing, gravure printing. After evaporation of the solvent the obtained film is polymerized using UV light to give a cross-linked dichroic liquid crystal film of preferably 0.1 to 100 μηι thickness, more preferable 0.2 to 50 μηι thickness, even more preferable 0.5 to 20 μηι thickness. If required such films may further be coated with other layers, such as, e.g. protective layers for protection against oxygen, UV-irradiation or mechanical stress. Such films may be used in the manufacture of devices such as polarizers or optical filters. Examples of substrates used in the preparation of dichroic LCP films may include transparent substrates, such as glass or plastic including an orientation layer, which is able to induce a uniform orientation to the mixture. Such orientation layers may include rubbed polyimide, or polyamide or preferably layers of photo-orientable materials. A well-suited kind of photo-orientable orientation layers are Linearly Photopolymerizable Polymers (LPP), also sometimes referred to as Light Controlled Molecular Orientation (LCMO). Backgrounds and manufacturing of such orientation layers are disclosed in, for example, US 5,389,698, US 5,838,407, US 5,602,661 , US 6,160,597, US 6,144,428, all of the applicant. Using LPP layers, segments (pixels) of locally varying orientation may be formed. Thus, not only uniformly aligned dichroic LCP layers but also structured complex orientation patterns within the dichroic LCP layers may be produced. Furthermore multilayer systems formed from stacks of alternating LPP and LCP layers, wherein at least one of the LCP layers is a dichroic LCP layer are feasible. Such layers or stacks of layers may additionally be covered by other well-known functional layers, such as, e.g. protecting layers against oxygen or humidity or layers for protection against ultraviolet radiation. It has been shown, e.g. in WO 99/64924, that photo-orienting materials like LPPs may also be able to orient liquid crystals, such as LCPs, if they are admixed to the mixture to be oriented prior to illumination with polarized light. In this way, orientation layers and LCP layers need not be formed separately. Thus, an analogous preparation of a dichroic LCP film using an inventive mixture, which in addition contains a photo-orientable material, may also be possible. In addition, the present invention relates to the use of said composition of the present invention and a dichroic polymer network, a dichroic liquid crystalline polymer film (LCP film) or a dichroic liquid crystalline polymer gel of the present invention for the preparation of electro-optical and optical devices, preferably including security devices or multi-layer systems, such as functional foils. A further aspect of the invention provides an electro-optical or optical device, preferably a security device or an optical film, or a multi-layer system, such as a functional foil, comprising a dichroic polymer network, a dichroic liquid crystalline polymer film (LCP film) or a dichroic liquid crystalline polymer gel of the present invention. Electro-optical or optical devices may include structured or unstructured optical filters, polarizers, especially linear or circular polarizers, etc. . Examples of electro-optical or optical devices are polarizers, optical films, security or authentication devices may for instance be used to safeguard banknotes, credit cards, securities, identity cards and the like against forgery and copying.

The mixtures M|_CP1 to M|_CP16 are used to produce oriented, dichroic liquid crystal samples on plastic substrates as described below. Production of dichroic LCP layers: Sixteen samples Pi to Pi6 are prepared, whereby each single specimen comprised an alignment layer and a dichroic liquid crystal polymer layer. The alignment layers are manufactured using the linearly photo-polymerizable aligning (LPP) technique. The dichroic liquid crystal polymer layers are oriented by the adjacent LPP layers. The manufacturing processes of both layers are described in the following. For the production of an LPP orientation layer, suitable LPP materials are described for example in patent publications EP 0 61 1 786, WO 96/10049, EP 0 763 552 and US 6107427, and include cinnamic acid derivatives and ferulic acid derivatives. For the examples, the following LPP material is chosen, which is described in WO2012/08504, example 1 : A 4 wt% solution of the above mentioned LPP material in a mixture of solvent composed of methylethylketone and cyclohexanone (80/20 w/w) is coated on a BOPP (50μηι) substrate using a bar coater (KBar 0). The foil is then warmed for 30 seconds at 80°C in an oven. The resulting layer has a thickness of approximately 100 nanometers. The coated film is then exposed to linearly polarized UV light from a mercury high pressure lamp using an energy dose of 300 mJ/cm2 at room temperature. The layer is then used as an orientation layer for a liquid crystal material comprising dichroic dyes. For the production of the dichroic LCP layers, the mixtures M|_CP1 to M|_CP16 are dissolved in a mixture of solvent composed of methylethylketone and cyclohexanone (80/20 w/w) to give a 40 wt% solution. These LCP mixtures, which include dichroic dyes, are then coated on top of the photo-exposed LPP layers using a bar coater (KBar 2). The coated dichroic LCP layers are then dried at 60°C for approximately 30 seconds in an oven. For photo-initiated cross-linking of the liquid crystals and dye components, the layers are exposed to isotropic light from a xenon lamp using an energy dose of 1 500 mJ/cm2 at room temperature in an inert atmosphere. The resulting layer has a thickness of approximately 3 micrometers. The procedure described above gives photo-aligned dichroic LCP layers on plastic substrates leading to sixteen different samples P1 to P16 derived from the sixteen dichroic LCP mixtures M|_CP1 to M|_CP1 6- Order parameters of samples Pi to P-| 6: The order parameter S of a dichroic dye is given by the following expression: S = On - D± I On + 2 Di wherein D„ and are the optical densities of a dichroic dye in a liquid crystal measured for light polarizations parallel and perpendicular to the liquid crystal director. Table 2 shows the order parameters S of samples Pi to P-| 6 measured at the indicated w velength. All samples Ί to P-| 6 are cross-linked successfully. The surfaces are completely dry and are more or less resistant against scratches. 1 .
