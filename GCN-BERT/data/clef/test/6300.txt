164.2: 4-[1-(2-chloro-pyridin-3-yl)-ureido]-piperidine-1-ethyl carboxylate
43.3 g (42.3 mmol) of 4-(2-chloro-pyridin-3-ylamino)-piperidine-1-ethyl carboxylate in solution in 200 mL of a tetrahydrofuran/isopropyl acetate 1/1 mixture is added to a solution of 15.8 mL (51 mmol) of chlorosulphonyl isocyanate in 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran. The reaction mixture is stirred for 1 hour at room temperature and then hydrolysed with 15 mL of water. After stirring for 18 h at room temperature, the reaction is stopped by adding 10% solution of sodium hydroxide up to pH 8-9 and then extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases are combined, washed with a saturated solution of sodium chloride and dried over sodium sulphate. The solvents are evaporated and then the residue is taken up in ether and drained. 32 g (74%) of 4-[1-(2-chloro-pyridin-3-yl)-ureido]-piperidine-1-ethyl carboxylate is obtained in the form of a white powder.
