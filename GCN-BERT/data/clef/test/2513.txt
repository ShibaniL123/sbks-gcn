6-(2-chloropropanoyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (1.00 g, 4.21 mmol), thiourea (0.35 g, 4.63 mmol) and triethylamine (0.88 mL, 6.31 mmol) suspended in anhydrous ethanol (12 ml) in a sealed tube under argon atmosphere. The sealed tube was microwaved at 120Â° C. for 45 min. The brown precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with cold ethanol. The residue was purified by precipitating in diethyl ether and filtration to 6-(2-amino-5-methylthiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.92 g, 84%) as a yellow solid.
