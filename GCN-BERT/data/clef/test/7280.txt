FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to' extended release pharmaceutical compositions comprising nevirapine as an active agent or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, at least one lubricant other than magnesium stearate optionally along with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s). The present invention also provides process of preparing such compositions and prophylactic and/or therapeutic methods of using such compositions for treating HIV-1 infection in adults and in children or associated disorders or conditions thereof. The compositions of the present invention are safe, effective and well-tolerated, and are useful for the management such as prophylaxis, amelioration and/or treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and in children. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION ‘Human immunodeficiency virus’ commonly tenned as HIV is a lentivirus (slowly replicating retrovirus) that causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition in humans in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Both the virus and the disease are often referred to together as ‘HIV/AIDS’. People with HIV have what is called HIV infection. As a result, some will then develop AIDS. The virus is passed from one person to another through blood-to-blood and sexual contact. In addition, infected pregnant women can pass HIV to their babies during pregnancy, delivering the baby during childbirth, and through breast feeding. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells. HIV can be divided into two major types, HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2). HIV-1 is related to viruses found in chimpanzees and gorillas living in western Africa, while HIV-2 viruses are related to viruses found in the endangered West African primate sooty mangabey {Sharp, Ρ. Μ.; Hahn, Β. Η. (2011), "Origins of HIV and the AIDS Pandemic". Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine 1 (1): α006841-α006835.}. HIV-1 viruses may be further divided into groups. The HIV-1 ‘group M’ viruses predominate and are responsible for the AIDS pandemic. Group Μ can be further subdivided into subtypes based on genetic sequence data. Some of the subtypes are known to be more virulent or are resistant to different medications. Likewise, HIV-2 viruses are thought to be less virulent and transmissible than HIV-1 Μ group viruses, although HIV-2 is known to cause AIDS. Reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) are a class of antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV infection or AIDS. When HIV infects a cell, reverse transcriptase copies the viral single stranded RNA genome into a double-stranded viral DNA. The viral DNA is then integrated into the host chromosomal DNA, which then allows host cellular processes, such as transcription and translation to reproduce the virus. RTIs block reverse transcriptase's enzymatic function and prevent completion of synthesis of the double-stranded viral DNA, thus preventing HIV from multiplying. RTIs come in three forms: a) Nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NARTIs or NRTIs): In order to be incorporated into the viral DNA, NARTIs or NRTIs must be activated in the cell by the addition of three phosphate groups to their deoxyribose moiety, to form NRTI triphosphates. This phosphorylation step is carried out by cellular kinase enzymes. Examples of this class of drugs include zidovudine, didanosine, entecavir, lamivudine, and the like. b) Nucleotide analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NtARTIs or NtRTIs): Nucleoside analogs are converted into nucleotide analogs by the body. E.g. of these class of drugs include tenofovir, adefovir and the like. c) Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs): NNRTIs attach themselves to reverse transcriptase and prevent the enzyme from converting RNA to DNA. In turn, HIV's genetic material cannot be incorporated into the healthy genetic material of the cell, and prevents the cell from producing new virus. Examples of this class of drugs include nevirapine, etravirine, efavirenz and the like. Nevirapine belongs to the class of NNRTIs and is a member of the dipyridodiazepinone chemical class of compounds. The chemical name of nevirapine is 11-cyclopropyl-5,1 l-dihydro-4-methyl-6H-dipyrido [3,2-b:2',3'-e][l,4] diazepin-6-one. Nevirapine is a white to off-white crystalline powder with the molecular weight of 266.30 and the molecular formula C15H14N40. Nevirapine has the following structural formula: Nevirapine is currently marketed as Viramune XR® tablets and indicated for combination antiretroviral treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and in children 6 to less than 18 years of age and was approved on March 25, 2011 in USA. The extended tablet formulation contains 100 mg or 400 mg of nevirapine and the inactive ingredients lactose monohydrate, hypromellose, iron oxide, and magnesium stearate. Nevirapine is also marketed as Viramune® immediate release tablets that are intended to be administered twice daily in order to maintain a therapeutically appropriate blood level of the active ingredient nevirapine. It is known in the art that modified release dosage forms provide a longer period of pharmacologic response after the administration of the dosage form than that which is ordinarily experienced after the administration of the conventional, rapid, immediate or fast release dosage forms and further provide benefit in terms of reduced side effects associated with conventional dosage forms which will increase the convenience leading to better compliance. US patent 5,366,972 discloses the compound Nevirapine.US patent 8,460,704 discloses a method for treating HIV-1 infection which comprises once daily administration to a human infected by HIV-1 a tablet pharmaceutical dosage form wherein each tablet comprises 400 mg of anhydrous nevirapine; 270 mg of Hypromellose 2208; 400 mg of lactose monohydrate; and 10 mg of magnesium stearate; wherein each tablet is compressed by a force of 10-25 kN. PCT publication WO 2013/111147 Α1 discloses an extended release solid oral pharmaceutical composition comprising nevirapine or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, polymorphs, solvates or hydrates thereof, a release control polymer/ material selected from pregelatinized starch having average particle diameter 20 to 40μ, ammonio methacrylate copolymer (Type- Β), ethyl cellulose, povidone and combinations thereof and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. It is known in the prior art that lubricants prevent adhesion of the tablet material to the surface of dies and punches, reduce inter-particulate friction, facilitate the ejection of tablets from the die cavities, and may improve the rate of flow of the formulation. Commonly used lubricants include magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, and other metallic stearateswhich are in most cases hydrophobic materials. Poor selection or excessive amounts can result hardness variability, waterproofing the tablets, resulting in poor tablet disintegration and dissolution of the active ingredient. Further, lubricants like magnesium stearate provide metallic taste in the formulation. Inventors of the instant invention have developed modified release compositions comprising nevirapine by using conventional lubricants other than magnesium stearate which prevent the metallic taste in the formulation and at the same time have comparable dissolution and bioavailability with respect to the marketed product Viramune XR® (Nevirapine XR tablets).
