STABILIZATION OF POLYACRYLAMIDE EMULSION FORMULATIONS The present application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 14/279,563 filed May 16, 2014, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention [0001 ] The present invention relates to the method of preventing premature inversion or destabilization of polyacrylamide water-in-oil emulsions while silicon polyether copolymer breaker surfactant or organic breaker surfactant or a combination of these is blended with the emulsion. Such emulsions of polyacrylamide polymers or copolymers are typically used as friction reducers in hydraulic fracturing applications. Background of the Art [0002] In the oil & gas industry, polyacrylamide water-in-oil emulsions are used as additives in fracturing (fracking) and drilling applications. In fracturing, a large volume of fracturing fluid is injected under high pressure into the formation in order to fracture the rock formation (shale, sandstone, limestone, etc.) and this way liberating crude oil and/or natural gas from the pores. In hydraulic fracturing applications, high molecular weight anionic and cationic polyacrylamides are used as friction reducers where the hydrated polymer suppresses the turbulence present in high velocity gradient water. Since hydraulic fracturing is performed at very high injection rates, reduction of pumping pressure as a result of friction reduction will result in less power consumption by the pumps and thus the use of effective friction reducers in fracturing fluids can decrease the cost of the operation by a large margin. [0003] Water-in-oil emulsions of polymers of acrylamide monomers or copolymers of acrylamide and acrylate monomers are those in which the continuous phase is oil and the polymer is present in the aqueous emulsion drops (dispersed phase). Upon dilution with water- based fluids the emulsion inverts and releases the polymer into the fluid and the polymer chains hydrate. This process is known as inversion. An advantage of the water-in-oil emulsion form is that the polyacrylamide is partially hydrated in the aqueous drop phase and thus it is more easily hydrated further, without making the emulsion highly viscous. [0004] The above water-in-oil polyacrylamide emulsions may also comprise "breaker surfactants". These can be medium (7-12) to high (12-16) HLB value (Hydrophile Lipophile Balance) surfactants. The role of the breaker surfactants is to destabilize the emulsion and promote the phase inversion upon dilution so that the polyacrylamide can easily disperse in the water phase when the water-in-oil polyacrylamide emulsions are diluted with water or brine. Therefore, these surfactants are known as "breaker surfactants" or "invertors" for water-in-oil emulsions. Silicon surfactants of medium to high HLB values (-8-16) can also destabilize the water-in-oil emulsion by phase inversion and hence can be used as breaker surfactants for water- in-oil polyacrylamide emulsions. [0005] A potential problem with the use of breaker surfactants is that they can also enable premature inversion of the water-in-oil polyacrylamide emulsions prior to dilution during storage, handling etc. This causes a rapid increase in the viscosity of the emulsion as part of the dispersed phase is inverted into the continuous oil phase which leads to a significant increase in the emulsion's viscosity, and causes separation and handling problems. Such emulsion blends are considered as unstable and will not deliver the required performance upon dilution with water or brine. Therefore, a method is desired to prevent the inversion of the polyacrylamide water-in-oil emulsion while breaker surfactant(s) are present in the emulsion's continuous, oil phase. The present invention discloses a novel method to prevent the premature inversion of water-in-oil polyacrylamide emulsion when one or more breaker surfactant is mixed with the emulsion.

[00026] The present invention provides herein a method to prevent premature destabilization of water-in-oil emulsion of polyacrylamide while a breaker surfactant is blended with it. [00027] In an embodiment of the present invention the water-in-oil emulsions used in this invention preferably comprise water soluble copolymers of acrylamide/acrylate monomers. Other water soluble polymers comprise such as polyethylene oxide, polyacrylamide, and partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide. Other water soluble materials contain copolymers of acrylamide, methacrylamide, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, alkali metal acrylate, and alkali metal methacrylates.

Also includes water soluble terpolymer of acrylamide, AMPS, NVP, methylstyrene sulfate, and methacrylmidopropyltrimethylammonium chloride. [00028] Water-in-oil polyacrylamide emulsions for friction reduction application are those in which the continuous phase is oil and the polyacrylamide is present in the aqueous emulsion drops (dispersed phase). These are normally prepared via emulsion co -polymerization of acrylamide and the desired co-monomer in a biphasic solvent system (for example, petroleum distillate oil and water). Total actives in these emulsions can be 20-50%. Other possible components of the friction reducer composition are petroleum products in the form of oil, breaker surfactants, chelating and complexing agents, pH stabilizers, etc. [00029] Water-in-oil polyacrylamide emulsions are frequently used as friction reducers. When the emulsion is diluted with water or brine then it inverts and the dispersed phase will deliver the polymers in the water or brine. An advantage of the water-in-oil emulsion form is that the polyacrylamide is partially hydrated in the aqueous drop phase and thus it will easily be hydrated further, without making the emulsion highly viscous. Nevertheless even this hydration process takes time with the large polymers used here. [00030] 'Friction reducers' for water based liquids are the chemical additives added to the aqueous liquids to reduce the frictional pressure during turbulent flow, for example during hydraulic fracturing of subterranean formations. These additives lower the friction or drag by suppressing the turbulence present in high velocity gradient water and as a result water can flow faster. [00031 ] The dose of friction reducer is typically 0.25 gallons per 1000 gallons to 5-gallons per 1000 gallons of water, [00032] The term 'brine' refers to a solution of water and electrolytes such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, etc. [00033] The term 'heavy brine' is used when the concentration of the electrolytes present exceeds a certain value and has greater effect on the performance of the polymer. Heavy brines may be, for example, seawater, or recycled water / flow back (produced) water from stimulation of the wells, etc. Typically, heavy brines contain more than 3 wt% of salt in the water. Standardized 0% API brine contains 7.5% NaCl and 2.5% CaCl2 in water. [00034] 'Fracturing fluid' used in hydraulic fracturing or fracing is defined as the mixture of large amount of fresh or salt water (85-95%), sand, ceramic or resin coated proppant (5-15%) and <0.5% chemical additives such as friction reducers, viscosifiers, fluid loss additives, gel breakers, emulsifiers, surfactants, non-emulsifiers, pH control additives, cross-linkers, gel stabilizers, biocides, etc. The total amount of fracturing fluid used per well may be 1- 4 million US gallons. [00035] The present invention provides herein a method of stabilizing a friction reducer composition comprising a. polyacrylamide emulsion; b. breaker surfactant said method comprising adding an effective amount of an organic additive with the formula R-O-R', where R is a monovalent, linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon with 1-200 carbon atoms, preferably 1-100 carbon atoms, and R' is a monovalent, linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon with 1-70 carbon atoms and can also contain oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur heteroatoms, preferably 1- 40 carbon atoms and can also contain oxygen atoms, more preferably 1 -40 carbon atoms and can also contain oxygen atoms, even more preferably R' is -C(0)R" wherein R" is a monovalent, linear or branched, saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon with 1-40 carbon atoms. [00036] In another embodiment of the present invention, said organic additive is a fatty acid ester. [00037] In another embodiment of the present invention the fatty acid esters are obtained from trans-esterification of seed oils such as rapeseed, soy bean, palm, sunflower, coconut, sotton seed, hemp, canola, olive and linseed, etc. The alkyl are aryl esters may be obtained from saturated or unsaturated fatty acids such as, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, myristoleic acid, linoleic acid, alpha-linoleic acid, stearic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, capric acid, etc. [00038] In another embodiment of the present invention the arganic additive can be 1 wt% to 6 wt% of the total friction reducer composition, [00039] In an embodiment of the present invention the water-in-oil emulsion further comprises breaker surfactant e.g., linear and branched alkyl/aryl alcohol ethoxylates, ethoxylates sorbitans, octylphenol ethoxylates, nonylphenol ethoxylates, ethoxylated seed oil such as castor oil and similar molecules. [00040] In another embodiment of the present invention the water-in-oil emulsion further comprises a surfactant described by the following formula: R-C6H4-0(C2H40)aZ, wherein, a = 4-17; R = linear or branched alkyl group containing from 1 to 14 carbon atoms; Z is K, acetyl or a monovalent hydrocarbon group containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Z is preferably methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, or butyl group. [00041] In an embodiment of the present invention the water-in-oil emulsion further comprises silicon polyether copolymer(s) as breaker surfactant(s). [00042] In another embodiment of the present invention the water-in-oil emulsion further comprises a silicon polyether copolymer surfactant selected from the group consisting of a) silicone polyether(s) defined by the formula: Me3Si-0-SiMe(R)-0-SiMe3, wherein, R = (C3H6)0(C2H40)a(C3H60)b(C4H80)cZJ a = 4 - 17, b = 0 26, c = 0 - 26 and Z is H, acetyl or a monovalent hydrocarbon group containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms; b) silicone polyether(s) defined by the formula: Me3Si-[OSiMe2]x-[0-SiMe(R)]y-0-SiMe3j wherein, x = 0 - 74, y i - ΐ ϋ. R = (C3H6)0(C2H40)a(C3¾0)b(C4H80)cZ, a = 5 - 17, b = 0 - 26, c = 0 - 26 and Z is H, acetyl or a monovalent hydrocarbon group containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms; and c) silicon polyether(s) defined by the formula: Me3Si(C2H4)SiMe2(C3H60)(C2H40)xZ, wherein, x = 3-17 and Z = H, acetyl or a monovalent hydrocarbon group containing from 1 to 12 carbon atoms. [00043] In an embodiment of the present invention breaker surfactant(s) is added after the water-in-oil polyacryl amide emulsion is formed and the amount can be 0.5 wt% to 7 wt% of total emulsion weight. [00044] The composition herein is advantageously used as a friction reducer for water based fluids used for hydraulic fracturing in the oil and gas industry. Applications for the Embodiments of the Invention: Friction reduction [00045] Friction reducing emulsions normally comprise a class of high molecular weight linear polymers. These can be neutral, anionic or cationic in nature. The charge on these polymers comes from the co-monomer used in the preparation. Such emulsions may also contain surfactants. The present invention describes the method to form stable emulsion blends possessing high HLB surfactants. High HLB surfactants aid in the inversion of w/o polyacryl amide emulsion, thus facilitates the release of polymer into aqueous fluid. [00046] The availability of fresh water in some oil and gas fields is declining as the hydraulic fracturing operations are increasing to extract more and more crude oil and natural gas from rock formations. Thus, the use of produced or flow-back water or recycled water remains a viable option. Recycling of produced water is an expensive process to the oil and gas industry. Produced or flow-back water as such contains large amount of salts, which may consist of a variety of mono and multivalent cations or anions and many of the anionic friction reducers fail to produce strong friction reduction in such water. Inversion of such emulsions in produced water or heavy brines requires high amounts of high HLB surfactants. Newly developed stable polyacrylamide w/o emulsion compositions comprising of high HLB surfactants and anionic polyacrylamide emulsion offers a new class of friction reducers suitable for heavy and complex brine. EXAMPLES [00047] Materials: Samples of polyacrylamide water-in-oil emulsions (Emulsion-1, Emulsion-2, Emulsion-3 and Emulsion-4) containing anionic polyacrylamide with petroleum distillate as a continuous phase were obtained from Kemira (Atlanta, GA, USA), and SNF (Riceboro, GA, USA). Samples of fatty acid ester (Additive-1) were obtained from Henkel (Cincinnati, OH5 UA) and Cargill (Chicago, IL, USA). Medium to high HLB value (-8-16) silicon polyether copolymer breaker surfactants (Sil-1, Sil-2, Sil-3, Sil-4 and Sil-5) are made following known synthetic procedures. Samples of high HLB (~10-16) organic breaker surfactants (Org-1 and Org-2) were obtained from Dow Chemicals (Midland, MI, USA). [00048] Sample Preparation: The blends were prepared by following two approaches: (1) blending the breaker surfactant(s) (l-6wt%) and polyacrylamide emulsion, and (2) blending Additive- 1 (1-6 wt%), the breaker surfactants (l-6wt%) and polyacrylamide emulsion. The blends were then aged in sealed vials for 24 hours and 7 days (at room temperature and 50°C), and the viscosity of blends is measured at these time intervals. The details are described in Examplesl-4 and Tables 1-4. [00049] The viscosity was measured with a Brookfield RV Rheometer DV-III Ultra (Brookfield, Middleboro, MA, USA) at room temperature using a #7 spindle at 100 rpm and reported in cP (centipoise). [00050] 'Viscosity' refers to the viscosity of the polyacrylamide emulsion or blended mixture of polyacrylamide emulsion and breaker surfactant, before dilution. [00051] The 'stability' of a blend refers to the ability of water- in-oil polyacrylamide emulsion present in the blend to resist change in its properties. In the present invention, the stability of water-in-oil polyacrylamide emulsion blends is characterized by rheology. [00052] > 25% increase in the viscosity of a blend in 24 hours referenced to the control emulsion's 24 hours viscosity represents an 'unstable' emulsion. [00053] < 25% increase in the viscosity of a blend in 24 hours referenced to the control emulsion's 24 hours viscosity represents a 'stable' emulsion. [00054] A blend with initial decrease (<25%) in the viscosity that is maintained upon aging is considered as 'stable' emulsion. EXAMPLE 1 [00055] Run 1 : Referring to Table 1 below, 0.5g (2 wt %) of Sil-1 was blended with 24.5g (98 wt %) of emulsion- 1. The contents were mixed for 30 minutes at room temperature. [00056] Run 2: Referring to Table 1 below, 1.0g (4 wt %) of the Additive-1 was blended with 23.5g (94 wt %) of emulsion-1. The contents were mixed for 15 minutes. After that, 0.5g (2 wt %) of Sil- l was added while mixing. The contents were mixed for another 15 minutes. [00057] Run 3 to Run 10: Referring to Table 1 below, the blends were prepared using Emulsion-1, SiI-2, Org-1, Org-2 and Additive-1 similarly to run 1 or run 2. [00058] The viscosity of ran 1 to run 10 and Emulsion-1 samples is shown in Table 1. The blends comprising 4 wt % of Additive-1 prior to the addition of surfactant showed much greater stability while aging at room temperature as well as at 50 °C. Table 1 Polyacrylamide emulsion-2 with breaker surfactants and Additive- 1 EXAMPLE-2 [00059] Run 11 to Run 13: Referring to Table 2 below, the blends were prepared using Emulsion-2, Sil-2 and Additive- 1 similarly to run 1 or run 2. The blends comprising 3 wt % or 4 wt % of Additive- 1 prior to the addition of surfactant showed much greater stability while aging at room temperature as well as at 50 °C. Table 2 Polyacrylamide emulsion-2 with breaker surfactants and Additive- 1 EXAMPLE-3 [00060] Run 14 to Run 17: Referring to Table 3 below, the blends were prepared using Emulsion-3, Sil-1, Sil-2, Sil-3 and Additive-1 similarly to run 1 or run 2. The blends comprising 4 wt % of Additive-1 prior to the addition of breaker surfactant showed much greater stability while aging at room temperature as well as at 50 °C. Table 3 Polyacryl amide emulsion-3 with breaker surfactants and Additive-1 EXAMPLE-4 [00061] Run 18 to Run 23: Referring to Table 4 below, the blends were prepared using Emulsion-4, Sil-2, Org-1 and Additive-1 similarly to run 1 or run 2. The blends comprising 4 wt% of Additive-1 prior to the addition of surfactant showed much greater stability while aging at room temperature as well as at 50 °C. Table 4 Polyacrylamide emulsion-4 with breaker surfactants and Additive- 1 EXAMPLE 5. [00062] Referring to Tabic 5 below, anionic polyacrylamide emulsions (Emulsion 1-3) were blended with silicon polyetlier copolymer and Additive- 1 (Formulations 1 -8) and all the formulations were aged for 24 hours before measurement. [00063] A Rheometer, model Physica MCR 301 (Anton Par, Ashland, VA, USA) was used to investigate the rheological properties of the new compositions using the coaxial cylinder measuring system (Bob Radius 13.331mm, Cup Radius 14.460mm, Measuring Gap 1.129 mm). All the experiments were carried out at 25°C and at 2500s"1 shear rate. [00064] 1.66wt% of Formulations 1, as described in Table 2, were injected to a measured amount of 10% brine containing 7.5% NaCl and 2.5% CaCl2 and the viscosity of the solutions was monitored for 300s. 'Hydration viscosity' in the table refers to the viscosity value obtained after hydration of the polyacrylamide polymer in brine during rheology experiment. All other experiments were conducted in identical experimental conditions. [00065] "%Increase in Hydration Viscosity" of polyacrylamide is calculated by referencing the hydration, viscosity of Emulsion 1 -3 obtained at 300s. [00066] 'Viscosity' refers to the viscosity of the polyacrylamide emulsion or blended mixture of polyacrylamide emulsion and silicon polyetlier. This was measured with a Brookficld RV Viscometer DV-111 Ultra (Brookfield, Middleboro, MA, USA) at room temperature using #7 spindle at 100 rpm. [00067] 'Tolerance of brine' refers to the capacity of polyacrylamide polymer to get hydrated in the brine. This was qualitatively determined based on the physical appearance of the resultant fluid from rheology experiment. "Good" rating means no precipitation or flocculation, "Fair" rating means that only moderate precipitation or flocculation, while "Bad" rating means that strong precipitation or flocculation was observed. [00068] 'Hydration viscosity' refers to the viscosity value obtained after hydration of the polyacrylamide polymer in brine during rheology experiment. The viscosity data is reported in centipoise (cP) unit or otherwise noted. Table 5 ition, viscosity, rheology and brine tolerance of the formulations containing polyacrylamide emulsion, breaker surfactant and Additive- 1 [00069] The breaker surfactants used herein facilitated inversion of dispersed phase of water-in-oil polyacrylamide emulsion when they were blended with such emulsions. This caused a rapid increase in the viscosity of the emulsion as part of the dispersed phase was inverted into the continuous oil phase which leads to a significant increase in the emulsion's viscosity. Such blends were considered as unstable. On the other hand, addition of Additive- 1 prior to the addition of above said breaker surfactants resulted in stable blends. The accelerated aging test at 50 °C revealed that Additive-1 stabilized samples have high kinetic stability and longer shelf life. As shown in Example 5 and Table 5, the presence of organic additive does not have a negative impact on the inversion of the polyacrylamide emulsion which is suggested by the high inversion and high hydration viscosities of the formulations 1-8 as compared to corresponding controls (Emulsion- 1 or Emulsion-2 or Emulsion-3).
