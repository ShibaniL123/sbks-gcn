This disclosure is generally directed to an intermediate transfer member that includes a vinyl acetate crotonic acid copolymer, and an intermediate transfer member that comprises a mixture of a polyimide, a vinyl acetate crotonic acid copolymer, an optional fluoropolymer, an optional polysiloxane, and an optional conductive component. BACKGROUND Intermediate transfer members, such as intermediate transfer belts selected for transferring a developed image in xerographic systems, are known. For example, there are known intermediate transfer members that include materials with characteristics that cause these members to become brittle, resulting in inadequate acceptance of the developed image, and subsequent partial transfer of developed xerographic images to a substrate like paper. A disadvantage relating to the preparation of an intermediate transfer member is that there is usually deposited a separate release layer on a metal substrate, and thereafter there is applied to the release layer the intermediate transfer member components or composition, and where the release layer allows the components to be separated from the member by peeling or by the use of mechanical devices. Thereafter, the intermediate transfer member components are in the form of a film, which can be selected for xerographic imaging systems, or the film can be deposited on a supporting substrate like a polymer layer. The use of an intermediate release layer adds to the cost and time of preparation, and such a layer can modify a number of the intermediate transfer member characteristics. Intermediate transfer members that include certain additives, such as for example liquid phosphate esters, have a tendency to decompose, especially at temperatures where curing is accomplished, and where the decomposition generates coating defects and permits undesirable liquids to be present. Intermediate transfer members that enable acceptable registration of the final color toner image in xerographic color systems using synchronous development of one or more component colors, and using one or more transfer stations, are known. However, a disadvantage of using an intermediate transfer member in color systems is that a plurality of developed toner transfer operations is utilized, thus sometimes causing charge exchange between the toner particles and the transfer member, which ultimately can result in less than complete toner transfer. This can result in low resolution images on the image receiving substrate like paper, and image deterioration. When the image is in color, an image can additionally suffer from color shifting and color deterioration. There is a need for intermediate transfer members that substantially avoid or minimize the disadvantages of a number of known intermediate transfer members. Also, there is a need for intermediate transfer members with excellent thermal stability, surface coating uniformity, and acceptable mechanical and electrical properties. Further, there is a need for intermediate transfer members and compositions thereof with excellent wear characteristics and acceptable abrasion resistance, and which members possess improved stability with no or minimal degradation, or decomposition for extended time periods. Moreover, there is a need for intermediate transfer member materials with an absence of coating defects and that possess self release characteristics from a number of substrates that are selected when such members are prepared. Another need relates to intermediate transfer members that have excellent conductivity or resistivity, and that possess acceptable humidity insensitivity characteristics leading to developed images with minimal resolution issues. Yet additionally, there is a need for intermediate transfer members that can be economically and efficiently manufactured. These and other needs are achievable in embodiments with the intermediate transfer members and compositions or components thereof disclosed herein.

Intermediate Transfer Member Formation The intermediate transfer member mixtures illustrated herein comprising, for example, a polyamic acid or a polyimide generated from the polyamic acid, a vinyl acetate crotonic acid copolymer, an optional fluoropolymer, an optional polysiloxane, and an optional conductive filler component, can be formulated into an intermediate transfer member by a number of suitable methods. For example, with known milling processes, uniform dispersions of the intermediate transfer member mixtures can be obtained, and then coated on individual metal substrates, such as a stainless steel substrate or the like, using known draw bar coating or flow coating methods. The resulting individual film or films can be cured and dried at high temperatures, such as by heating the films at from about 100° C. to about 400° C., or from about 160° C. to about 325° C., for a suitable period of time, such as from about 20 to about 180 minutes, from about 40 to about 120 minutes, and more specifically, cured at about 75° C. for about 30 minutes, then at about 190° C. for 30 minutes, and finally cured at about 320° C. for about 60 minutes, while remaining on the metal substrates. After drying and cooling to room temperature, about 23° C. to about 25° C., the films self release from the steel substrates, that is the films release without any external assistance.

For example, the disclosed intermediate transfer members can be incorporated into a multi-imaging xerographic machine where each developed toner image to be transferred is formed on the imaging or photoconductive drum at an image forming station, and where each of these images is then developed at a developing station, and transferred to the intermediate transfer member. The images may be formed on a photoconductor and developed sequentially, and then transferred to the intermediate transfer member. In an alternative method, each image may be formed on the photoconductor or photoreceptor drum, developed, and then transferred in registration to the intermediate transfer member. In an embodiment, the multi-image system is a color copying system, wherein each color of an image being copied is formed on the photoreceptor drum, developed, and transferred to the intermediate transfer member. After the toner latent image has been transferred from the photoreceptor drum to the intermediate transfer member, the intermediate transfer member may be contacted under heat and pressure with an image receiving substrate such as paper. The toner image on the intermediate transfer member is then transferred and fixed, in image configuration, to the substrate such as paper. Specific embodiments will now be described in detail. These examples are intended to be illustrative, and are not limited to the materials, conditions, or process parameters set forth in these embodiments. All parts are percentages by weight of total solids of all the components unless otherwise indicated. The viscosity values were determined by a viscometer.

The resulting intermediate transfer member comprised of the above components in the ratios indicated did not self release from the stainless substrate, but rather adhered to this substrate. After being immersed in water for 3 months, the intermediate transfer member obtained eventually self released from the substrate. Example I There was prepared by admixing with stirring, a coating composition comprising special carbon black 4, obtained from Orion Chemicals, a polyimide of a polyamic acid of biphenyl tetracarboxylic dianhydride/diaminobenzene, commercially available as U-VARNISH A and S (about 20 weight in NMP), both available from UBE America Inc., New York, N.Y., or both also available from Kaneka Corporation, Texas, or a polyamic acid of pyromellitic dianhydride/4,4′-oxydianiline, commercially available from Industrial Summit Technology Corp., Parlin, N.J. with the trade name of PYRE-M.L.® RC-5019 or RC-5083, the Wacker Polymers Company vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymer VINNAPAS® C305, a solid, colorless to pale yellowish copolymer of vinyl acetate and crotonic acid, with an acid number of from about 30 to about 38 milligrams KOH/gram and the fluoropolymer NOVEC® FC-4432, a non-ionic polymeric fluorochemical surfactant available from the 3M Company, in a ratio of polyamic acid or polyimide/carbon black/vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymer/fluoropolymer of 87.2/11.5/1.1/0.2 were prepared in NMP, about 16.5 weight percent solids with Attritor milling for 6 hours.

The resulting intermediate transfer member, about 50 microns in thickness, was comprised of the above ingredients of special carbon black 4, the polyimide of the following formula/structure wherein n is equal to about 30, formed from the curing by heating of the intermediate containing mixture of the carbon black, the polyamic acid, the vinylacetate/crotonic acid copolymer, and the fluoropolymer in the ratios indicated, immediately self released from the stainless steel without the assistance of any external processes. Example II An intermediate transfer member is prepared by repeating the process of Example I except that the vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymer VINNAPAS® C305, with an acid number of from about 30 to about 38 milligrams KOH/gram, is replaced with the Wacker Polymers Company vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymer VINNAPAS® C341, a solid, colorless to pale yellowish copolymer of vinyl acetate and crotonic acid with an acid number of from about 6 to about 8 milligrams KOH/gram. Example III An intermediate transfer member was prepared by repeating the process of Example I except that the vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymer VINNAPAS® C305, with an acid number of from about 30 to about 38 milligrams KOH/gram, was replaced with the Wacker Polymers Company vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymer VINNAPAS® C501, a solid, colorless to pale yellowish copolymer of vinyl acetate and crotonic acid, with an acid number of from about 5.5 to about 7 milligrams KOH/gram. Measurements The above intermediate transfer members of Examples I and III, and the Comparative Example 1 were measured for Young's Modulus and Break Strengths following the known ASTM D882-97 process. Samples (0.5 inch×12 inch) of each intermediate transfer member were placed in the Instron Tensile Tester measurement apparatus, and then the samples were elongated at a constant pull rate until breaking. During this time, there was recorded the resulting load versus the sample elongation. The Young's Modulus was calculated by taking any point tangential to the initial linear portion of the recorded curve results and dividing the tensile stress by the corresponding strain. The tensile stress was calculated by the load divided by the average cross sectional area of each of the test samples. The results are provided in Table 1. The surface resistivity of the above intermediate transfer members of Examples I and III, and Comparative Example 1 were also measured using a High Resistivity Meter, and the results are provided in Table 1. TABLE 1 Surface Young's Release Time Break Resistivity Modulus from the Metal Strength (ohm/sq) (MPa) Substrate (MPa) Comparative 5.6 × 1010 6,000 Did not release; 163 Example 1 needed to be immersed in water for 3 months prior to being released. Example I 4.2 × 1010 8,700 Excellent; released in 225 VINNAPAS ® 10 seconds. C305 Example III 3.8 × 1010 8,550 Excellent; released in 205 VINNAPAS ® 10 seconds. C501 Incorporation of the vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymers into the above prepared intermediate transfer members had substantially no negative impacts on both the mechanical and electrical properties thereof, and no coating defects. Also, the intermediate transfer members of Examples I and III self released quickly from the substrate without the need to apply an additional release layer on the stainless steel, while the Comparative Example 1 did not self release and remained on the stainless steel substrate, being released only after immersed in water for three months. The Examples I, II and III intermediate transfer members were obtained at a lower cost, about 65 to about 75 percent lower than a number of known intermediate transfer members, such as those of Comparative Example 1, that were free of the vinyl acetate/crotonic acid copolymers in that the Examples I, II and III members do not require an added release layer coating on a stainless steel substrate when the members were initially prepared. After being released from the stainless steel substrate, the Examples I, II and III intermediate transfer products obtained can be used as intermediate transfer members, or the products obtained can be coated on supporting substrates of a polymer like a polyamide.
