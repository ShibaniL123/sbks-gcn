TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to boehmite having high thermal conductivity and a method for manufacturing the boehmite. BACKGROUND ART As an electronic device having high performance, a small size, and light weight is produced in recent years, high-density mounting of electronic compartments or high integration and fast speed of LSI is also performed, yielding a tendency of having high heat generation from electronic compartments. As such, a decrease in performance of electronic compartments may be caused if efficient cooling is not carried out. For such reasons, effective diffusion of heat from electronic compartments to outside is an important task to achieve. Also in LED which is used for liquid display or a head light of an automobile, light amount is reduced by heat accumulation on LED chips, and thus it is necessary to have heat diffusion. Since those electronic compartments and LED chip are mounted on an electronic board, it is desirable to promote heat diffusion by increasing thermal conductivity of an electronic board. Due to a good molding property and low cost, a resin board is used as an electronic board of a related art. However, since a resin has low thermal conductivity, a metal board or a ceramic board is used for an electronic board required to have thermal conductivity. However, by having electrical conductivity, the metal board cannot have electronic compartments directly mounted thereon, and it also has a problem of heavy weight, high cost, or the like. The ceramic board also has a problem like a difficulty in forming a complex pattern and high cost. Thus, it has been believed that using a resin board is still preferable. In this regard, as a method for having heat diffusion by enhancing thermal conductivity of a resin board, there is a method of filling a thermal conductive inorganic filler in a resin for constituting an electronic board or electronic compartments (see, Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2). As a thermal conductive inorganic filler used in a related art, there are metal powder (silver, copper, alumina, or the like), nitrides (aluminum nitride, boron nitride, silicon nitride, or the like), carbides (silicon carbide or the like), α-alumina, silica, or the like. With regard to the properties of various inorganic fillers, there are pros and cons as illustrated in Fig. 1. Metal powder, nitrides, and carbides are advantageous in that they have excellent thermal conductivity. However, there is a disadvantage of high cost. Furthermore, the inorganic filler to be filled in a resin for constituting an electronic board or electronic compartments is required to have high conductivity. In this regard, metal powder is disadvantageous in that it has electrical conductivity and a low insulating property. Furthermore, since a drill may be easily worn when an inorganic filler to be filled in a resin for forming a hole on an electronic board has high hardness, the inorganic filler is required to have low hardness. In this regard, by having high hardness, the nitrides, carbides, α-alumina, and silica have a problem that they have a poor drill processability. Meanwhile, there is boehmite as an inorganic filler which has been widely used in a related art as a flame retardant, a reinforcing material, a glittering material, or the like. As illustrated in Fig. 1, boehmite is particularly inexpensive and has an excellent insulating property, weight, hardness, and flame retardancy when compared to other inorganic filler. Furthermore, as it can be easily synthesized with controlled crystal morphology, it is also excellent in that high thermal conductivity can be obtained even with the same amount by enhancing the filling property to have high filling in electronic compartments with lowering of specific surface area or lowering of aspect ratio, or by creating a thermal conductive path (a path for heat transfer) according to increase of the aspect ratio. As such, if it can be used as an inorganic filler with thermal conductivity, boehmite can be very useful. CITATION LIST PATENT DOCUMENT Patent Document 1: JP 2011-184507 A Patent Document 2: JP 2011-127053 A SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION However, boehmite has a problem in that it has poorer thermal conductivity than other inorganic filler. As such, its use as a thermal conductive inorganic filler for heat diffusion has been limited in a related art. The present invention is devised under the circumstances described above, and an object of the present invention is to provide high thermal conductive boehmite having the characteristics of boehmite such as flame retardancy and high filling and yet has an improved thermal conductivity, and a method for manufacturing the high thermal conductive boehmite. MEANS FOR SOLVING PROBLEM To solve the problems described above, the inventors of the present invention conducted various determinations, and thus completed the present invention. Specifically, the present invention relates to high thermal conductive boehmite having thermal conductivity calculated in accordance with the following Mathematical Formula 1 of 11.0 W/m·K or greater.1-Vf=λc-λf/λm-λf×λm/λc∧1/nn=3/ψ (with the proviso that, Vf represents the volume filling ratio of boehmite, λc represents the thermal conductivity (W/m·K) of a boehmite-resin composite, λf represents the thermal conductivity (W/m·K) of boehmite, λm represents the thermal conductivity (W/m·K) of the resin; n represents the shape factor of filler particles proposed by Hamilton and Crosser, ψ represents a value calculated by dividing the surface area of a sphere that has the same volume of a boehmite particle volume by the surface area of an actual particle, and ^ represents exponentiation). Mathematical Formula 1 is referred to as Kanari's equation and it is a mathematical formula used for analyzing thermal conductivity of a composite material like a polymer material blended with a filler (Katsuhiko Kanari: Thermal Conductivity of Composite System, Polymer, Vol. 26, No. 8, pp. 557-561, 1977). In Mathematical Formula 1, the volume filling ratio (Vf) ofboehmite is obtained as described below. Vf = A ÷ (A + B) (A: a value obtained by dividing the mass of boehmite blended in resin by the specific gravity, B: a value obtained by dividing the mass of resin by the specific gravity) Meanwhile, Vf in Table 1 to Table 5 and Fig. 2 to Fig. 6 is described as vol%. ψ in Mathematical Formula 1 is obtained as described below. ψ=9⁢πz∧1/3/z+8∧1/2 z: aspect ratio of boehmite The gist of the present invention is high thermal conductive boehmite having the 700°C dehydration amount of 14.0% to 15.7%. As described herein, the 700°C dehydration amount means the ratio of the reduced mass represented in terms of % when the temperature is increased to 700°C while the dehydration amount at 100°C is 0%. The gist of the present invention is a method for manufacturing high thermal conductive boehmite which is characterized in that boehmite is heat treated at 320°C to 430°C. With regard to the method for manufacturing thermal conductive boehmite, boehmite may be heat treated in an atmosphere of increased pressure. The boehmite may be also heat treated using over-heated water vapor. EFFECT OF THE INVENTION Since the high thermal conductive boehmite of the present invention has increased thermal conductivity while maintaining the characteristics of boehmite, it is excellent in terms of cost, insulating property, weight, and hardness. Furthermore, a thermal conductive inorganic filler having flame retardancy and high filling, which are the characteristics of boehmite, can be provided. The method for manufacturing the high thermal conductive boehmite of the present invention only needs a heating treatment of boehmite as a raw material, and thus high thermal conductive boehmite can be manufactured simply at low cost.

The non-treated boehmite and high thermal conductive boehmite in the drawing represent a composite with a resin blended with the non-treated boehmite and a composite with a resin blended with high thermal conductive boehmite, respectively. MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The high thermal conductive boehmite of the present invention can be manufactured by performing a heating treatment of boehmite at a pre-determined temperature. As for the boehmite to be a raw material, any boehmite can be used without being limited by a method for manufacturing boehmite (for example, boehmite synthesized from aluminum hydroxide by hydrothermal synthesis, boehmite synthesized by adding an additive to aluminum hydroxide followed by hydrothermal synthesis, boehmite synthesized from boehmite precursor which has been synthesized from various aluminum salts or aluminum alkoxides, boehmite hydrated by a hydrothermal treatment of transition alumina, boehmite synthesized from aluminum dawsonite, and natural boehmite), a shape of boehmite (for example, plate shape boehmite, needle shape boehmite, flake shape boehmite, cubic shape boehmite, disc shape boehmite, and boehmite in aggregated form), a size of a primary particle of boehmite, or the like. Boehmite is monohydrate of alumina, and with the dehydration according to the following reaction, the theoretical value of the dehydration amount is 15%. 2AlOOH → Al2O3+H2O A larger or smaller dehydration amount than the theoretical value indicates that impurities are contained. As the dehydration amount becomes lower than the theoretical value of 15%, more γ-alumina is contained. Further, as the dehydration amount becomes higher than the theoretical value of 15%, more aluminum hydroxide or pseudo boehmite is contained. For such reasons, the 700°C dehydration amount is preferably 14.0% to 15.7%, and more preferably 14.5% to 15.2%. That is because, when the 700°C dehydration amount is lower than 14.0%, the thermal conductivity is lowered due to generation of γ-alumina, and when it is higher than 15.7%, the thermal conductivity is lowered due to generation of pseudo boehmite. When γ-alumina is generated by excessive heating of boehmite as a raw material, a specific surface area is increased. For such reasons, the specific surface area of the high thermal conductive boehmite is preferably 95% to 1114%, and more preferably 100% to 110% of the specific surface area of the boehmite as a raw material. There are rarely cases in which the specific surface area is reduced by a heating treatment. However, it has been demonstrated that, when it is lower than 95%, crystal growth progresses to disrupt the crystal morphology, which is not desirable. On the other hand, when it is higher than 114%, it has been demonstrated that γ-alumina is generated to impair not only the thermal conductivity but also the flame retardancy and filling property, which is not desirable. The heating treatment of boehmite as a raw material is preferably performed under increased pressure. It is more preferable to perform the treatment under increased pressure containing water vapor. That is because, by performing the heating under increased pressure and increased pressure containing water vapor, generation of y-alumina which is caused by dehydration of boehmite is suppressed. The pressure is preferably higher than atmospheric pressure and the same or lower than 2 MPa. When it is higher than 2 MPa, it is not expected to have the effect of having suppressed generation of γ-alumina while expensive pressure-resistant facilities are still required for the treatment, and thus it is not economically favorable. The heating treatment of the boehmite as a raw material is preferably performed using over-heated water vapor. That is because, when the heating is performed using over-heated water vapor, generation of γ-alumina which is caused by dehydration of boehmite is suppressed. The heating temperature for manufacturing the high thermal conductive boehmite is preferably 320°C to 430°C, and more preferably 350°C to 400°C. That is because, when the heating temperature is lower than 320°C, the thermal conductivity of boehmite as a raw material is not increased to a sufficient level, and when it is higher than 430°C, the boehmite as a raw material can easily convert to γ-alumina with low thermal conductivity. Meanwhile, the heating temperature of 320°C to 430°C indicates the temperature of the boehmite itself as a raw material to be heated, and the heating temperature of a heating device may be higher than this temperature range. For example, in the case of atomizer heating or small-amount heating, it is possible that the boehmite itself as a raw material is heated to the temperature of 320°C to 430°C within a short time like several seconds with the heating device temperature of 800°C to 1000°C. The method for heating treatment is not particularly limited, as long as it allows a heating treatment at a pre-determined temperature. Examples thereof include a stationary method like a shelf type dryer or an electronic furnace, a stirring method like a stirring wing type, a paddle mixer type, a rotation drum type, and a rotary type, a fluid bed type, an atomizer type, a spray type, and a free-fall type within a heating pipe. Furthermore, the heating source is not particularly limited as long as it allows heating at a pre-determined temperature, and examples thereof include an electric heater for heating, a gas burner, hot wave, microwave, and induced heating. The heating time may vary depending on the aforementioned methods for heating treatment, and it is not particularly limited. For example, the stirring type method has good heating efficiency, and thus the heating time can be short. The atomizer type has a small process amount per unit time, and thus the treatment can be performed within an even shorter time. When the heating time is extended, the thermal conductivity is improved even for the same heating treatment method. However, when it is excessively long, γ-alumina is generated, which is not desirable. As for the heating time, 3 hours/350°C can be exemplified for the stationary method. However, it is generally 2 to 10 hours at 320°C to 430°C. Furthermore, 0.5 hour/350°C and several seconds/400°C can be exemplified for the stirring type and the atomizer type, respectively. The resin to be blended with the high thermal conductive boehmite is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include an epoxy resin, a silicone resin, a melamine resin, a urea resin, a phenol resin, unsaturated polyester, a fluororesin, polyamide such as polyimide, polyamide imide, or polyether imide, polyester such as polybutylene terephthalate or polyethylene terephthalate, polyphenylene sulfide, wholly-aromatic polyester, liquid crystalline polymer, polysulfone, polyether sulfone, polycarbonate, a maleimide-modified resin, an ABS resin, an acrylonitrile-acryl rubber · styrene resin, an acrylonitirle · ethylene · propylene·diene rubber-styrene resin, and a general-purpose resin such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, or polystyrene. Regarding a mechanism relating to increased thermal conductivity according to the heating treatment of boehmite as a raw material, it is believed that the mechanism is exhibited as the crystal defects that are present in boehmite as a raw material are removed or re-arranged. EXAMPLES [Manufacture of high thermal conductive boehmite (1)] As for the boehmite as a raw material of Examples and Comparative Examples shown in Table 1, Boehmite 1 shown in Table 6 was used. In Example 1 to Example 8, the boehmite as a raw material was subjected to a heating treatment at a pre-determined temperature for a pre-determined time by using a stationary electric furnace to manufacture the high thermal conductive boehmite of the present invention shown in Table 1, which was then blended with a resin. In Comparative Examples 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10, as boehmite as a raw material, non-treated boehmite without undergoing the heating treatment was blended with a resin. In Comparative Examples 3, 5, 8, and 11, the boehmite as a raw material was subjected to a heating treatment at 450°C by using a stationary electric furnace and then the high thermal conductive boehmite with partial γ-alumination (hereinbelow, referred to as "γ-aluminated high thermal conductive boehmite") was blended with a resin. In Comparative Examples 6, 9, and 12, the boehmite as a raw material was subjected to a heating treatment for a pre-determined time at 1250°C by using a stationary electric furnace and then the obtained α-alumina was blended with a resin. After blending the resin with each of the high thermal conductive boehmite, non-treated boehmite, γ-aluminated high thermal conductive boehmite, and α-alumina, thermal conductivity of the resin was measured. To 40 g of an epoxy resin (manufactured by The Dow Chemical Company, DER-331J), the high thermal conductive boehmite for Examples, the non-treated boehmite for Comparative Examples 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10, the γ-aluminated high thermal conductive boehmite for Comparative Example 3, 5, 8, and 11, or α-alumina for Comparative Examples 6, 9, and 12 was weighed and added to a vessel at a ratio to have the volume filling ratio shown in Table 1. Then, by using a rotation and revolution mixer (manufactured by THINKY CORPORATION, ARE-310), they were stirred and mixed for 2 minutes at revolution of 2000 rpm · rotation of 1200 rpm. To the resultant, 0.8 g (2% by weight relative to the epoxy resin) of 2-ethyl-4-methylimidazole (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was added as an initiator. It was then mixed for 2 minutes at revolution of 2000 rpm · rotation of 1200 rpm by using a planetary stirrer. An operation for deaeration treatment was further performed for 2 minutes. After that, it was subjected to a vacuum deaeration treatment and cured by heating for 2 hours at 120°C to obtain a test sample of Examples and Comparative Examples for measuring thermal conductivity. The obtained test sample for measuring thermal conductivity was cut to yield a test specimen of 40 mm x 40 mm x 20 mm and maintained for 2 hours or longer in an incubator at 25°C. After that, the test specimen was used for measuring the thermal conductivity of the resin by using a quick thermal conductivity meter (manufactured by KYOTO ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURING CO., LTD. QTM-500). Furthermore, in the column of "Characteristics of filler" in Table 1, the 700°C dehydration amount and specific surface area for each of the high thermal conductive boehmite, non-treated boehmite, γ-aluminated high thermal conductive boehmite, and α-alumina are shown. Meanwhile, the 700°C dehydration amount was measured by thermogravimetry using a thermogravimetric analyzer (manufactured by Bruker AXS). Furthermore, the specific surface area was measured by using an automatic specific surface area/pore distribution measurement device (manufactured by BEL JAPAN, INC. BELSORP mini) followed by analysis based on BET method.

Furthermore, the 700°C dehydration amount of the high thermal conductive boehmite of Examples is within a range of 14.4% to 14.9%. The thermal conductivity of Comparative Examples in which the γ-aluminated high thermal conductive boehmite is blended with a resin is lower than that of Examples. The thermal conductivity of Comparative Examples in which the α-alumina is blended with a resin is higher than that of Examples. Although α-alumina has high thermal conductivity, it is necessary for the boehmite as a raw material to be subjected to a heating treatment at a high temperature above 1000°C for a pre-determined time so that it becomes more expensive than the high thermal conductive boehmite. Further, since it is not a hydrate, it has no flame retardancy. In the γ-aluminated high thermal conductive boehmite of Comparative Examples 3, 5, 8, and 11, a significant amount of the boehmite as a raw material is converted to γ-alumina instead of a hydrate so that the 700°C dehydration amount is lowered compared to the non-treated boehmite. In the α-alumina of Comparative Examples 6, 9, and 12, the boehmite as a raw material is converted to α-alumina so that the 700°C dehydration amount was 0%. The specific surface area of the high thermal conductive boehmite of Examples is not different from the specific surface area of the non-treated boehmite of Comparative Examples, and almost no boehmite as a raw material was γ-aluminated or converted to pseudo boehmite. [Manufacture of high thermal conductive boehmite (2)] As for the boehmite as a raw material of Example 9 to Example 13 and Comparative Example 13 to Comparative Example 18 shown in Table 2, Boehmite 3 shown in Table 6 was used. As for the boehmite as a raw material of Example 14 to Example 19 and Comparative Example 19, Boehmite 4 shown in Table 6 was used. In Example 9 to Example 19, the boehmite as a raw material was subjected to a heating treatment at a pre-determined temperature for a pre-determined time by using a stationary electric furnace to manufacture the high thermal conductive boehmite of the present invention shown in Table 2, which was then blended with a resin. In Comparative Example 14 to Comparative Example 18, the heat-treated boehmite which has been subjected to a heating treatment at 280°C or 300°C for a pre-determined time was blended with a resin. In Comparative Example 13 and Comparative Example 19, as boehmite as a raw material, non-treated boehmite without undergoing the heating treatment was blended with a resin. Blending the high thermal conductive boehmite, heat-treated boehmite, and non-treated boehmite with a resin (blending amount of the high thermal conductive boehmite, heat-treated boehmite, and non-treated boehmite was set to the ratio for having the volume filling ratio shown in Table 2), measurement of the thermal conductivity, measurement of the 700°C dehydration amount, and measurement of the specific surface area were performed in the same manner as Manufacture of high thermal conductive boehmite (1).

However, there are also cases in which the thermal conductivity did not change even when the heating time is extended (see, Examples 18 and 19). Furthermore, the thermal conductivity of Comparative Example 14 to Comparative Example 18 is higher than that of Comparative Example 13 but lower than that of Examples, and thus it was not found to be a desirable temperature. The 700°C dehydration amount of the high thermal conductive boehmite of Examples is within a range of 15.2% to 15.7%. The specific surface area of the high thermal conductive boehmite of Examples is not different from the specific surface area of the non-treated boehmite of Comparative Examples, and almost no boehmite as a raw material was γ-aluminated or converted to pseudo boehmite. [Manufacture of high thermal conductive boehmite (3)] As for the boehmite as a raw material of Examples 20 and 21 and Comparative Examples 20 and 21 shown in Table 3, Boehmite 8 shown in Table 6 was used. As for the boehmite as a raw material of Example 22 and Comparative Example 22, Boehmite 9 shown in Table 6 was used. As for the boehmite as a raw material of Example 23 and Comparative Example 23, Boehmite 5 shown in Table 6 was used. In Example 20 to Example 23, the boehmite as a raw material was subjected to a heating treatment at a pre-determined temperature for a pre-determined time by using a stationary electric furnace to manufacture the high thermal conductive boehmite of the present invention shown in Table 3, which was then blended with a resin. In Comparative Example 20 to Comparative Example 23, as boehmite as a raw material, non-treated boehmite without undergoing the heating treatment was blended with a resin. Blending the high thermal conductive boehmite and non-treated boehmite with a resin (blending amount of the high thermal conductive boehmite and non-treated boehmite was set to the ratio for having the volume filling ratio shown in Table 3), measurement of the thermal conductivity, measurement of the 700°C dehydration amount, and measurement of the specific surface area were performed in the same manner as Manufacture of high thermal conductive boehmite (1).

Furthermore, the 700°C dehydration amount of the high thermal conductive boehmite of Examples is within a range of 14.0% to 15.2%. The specific surface area of the high thermal conductive boehmite of Example 22 was 95% of the specific surface area of the non-treated boehmite of Comparative Example 22. However, there was no difference in other Examples, and almost no boehmite as a raw material was γ-aluminated or converted to pseudo boehmite. Meanwhile, although the data were not specifically described, the thermal conductivity was improved by a heating treatment even for the case in which boehmite synthesized by hydration of transition alumina is used as a raw material, and thus it can be used as high thermal conductive boehmite. [Manufacture of high thermal conductive boehmite (4)] As for the boehmite as a raw material of Examples and Comparative Examples shown in Table 4, Boehmite 1 shown in Table 6 was used. In Example 24 to Example 26, the boehmite as a raw material was subjected to a heating treatment at a pre-determined temperature for a pre-determined time to manufacture the high thermal conductive boehmite of the present invention shown in Table 4, which was then blended with a resin. With regard to the method for heating treatment, a heating treatment under increased pressure, a treatment using over-heated water vapor, and a small-amount heating were performed instead of the method of using a stationary electric furnace of Manufacture of high thermal conductive boehmite (1) to (3). Meanwhile, the pressure for Example 24 was 0.5 MPa. In Comparative Example 24, as boehmite as a raw material, non-treated boehmite without undergoing the heating treatment was blended with a resin. Blending the high thermal conductive boehmite and non-treated boehmite with a resin (blending amount of the high thermal conductive boehmite and non-treated boehmite was set to the ratio for having the volume filling ratio shown in Table 4), measurement of the thermal conductivity, measurement of the 700°C dehydration amount, and measurement of the specific surface area were performed in the same manner as Manufacture of high thermal conductive boehmite (1). Meanwhile, the small-amount heating was performed by a method in which an electric furnace with internal volume of 7.5 L (manufactured by Isuzu Seisakusho, SSTS-25R) is heated in advance to 1000°C and 1 g of boehmite as a raw material, which has been thinly spread to thickness of 1.5 mm or less on a metallic petri dish, was added to the electric furnace and removed 5 seconds later. Temperature of the boehmite as a raw material which has been obtained right after the heating treatment according to this method was 390°C.

From Table 4, it was found that the thermal conductivity of Examples is higher than that of Comparative Examples even when the method for heating treatment is different. Furthermore, the 700°C dehydration amount of the high thermal conductive boehmite of Examples is within a range of 14.8% to 15.5%. The specific surface area of the high thermal conductive boehmite of Examples was not different from the specific surface area of the non-treated boehmite of Comparative Examples, and almost no boehmite as a raw material was γ-aluminated or converted to pseudo boehmite. [Manufacture of high thermal conductive boehmite (5) and obtainment of thermal conductivity] As for the boehmite as a raw material of Example 27 to Example 29 and Comparative Example 25 to Comparative Example 27 shown in Table 5, Boehmite 7 shown in Table 6 was used. As for the boehmite as a raw material of Example 30 to Example 32 and Comparative Example 28 to Comparative Example 30, Boehmite 6 shown in Table 6 was used. As for the boehmite as a raw material of Example 33 to Example 35 and Comparative Example 31 to Comparative Example 33, Boehmite 3 shown in Table 6 was used. As for the boehmite as a raw material of Example 36 to Example 38 and Comparative Example 34 to Comparative Example 36, Boehmite 2 shown in Table 6 was used. In Example 27 to Example 38, the boehmite as a raw material was subjected to a heating treatment at a pre-determined temperature for a pre-determined time by using a stationary electric furnace to manufacture the high thermal conductive boehmite of the present invention shown in Table 5, which was then blended with a resin. In Comparative Example 25 to Comparative Example 36, as boehmite as a raw material, non-treated boehmite without undergoing the heating treatment was blended with a resin. Blending the high thermal conductive boehmite and non-treated boehmite with a resin (blending amount of the high thermal conductive boehmite and non-treated boehmite was set to the ratio for having the volume filling ratio shown in Table 5), measurement of the thermal conductivity, measurement of the 700°C dehydration amount, and measurement of the specific surface area were performed in the same manner as Manufacture of high thermal conductive boehmite (1).

Furthermore, the 700°C dehydration amount of the high thermal conductive boehmite of Examples is within a range of 14.5% to 15.5%. The specific surface area of the high thermal conductive boehmite of Examples was not different from the specific surface area of the non-treated boehmite of Comparative Examples, and almost no boehmite as a raw material was γ-aluminated or converted to pseudo boehmite. By using Mathematical Formula 1, the thermal conductivity of the high thermal conductive boehmite and the non-treated boehmite of Examples 1, 4, 5, and 7 and Comparative Examples 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 that are illustrated in Fig. 2, Example 27 to 29 and Comparative Example 25 to Comparative Example 27 that are illustrated in Fig. 3, Example 30 to Example 32 and Comparative Example 28 to Comparative Example 30 that are illustrated in Fig. 4, Example 33 to Example 35 and Comparative Example 31 to Comparative Example 33 that are illustrated in Fig. 5, and Example 36 to Example 38 and Comparative Example 34 to Comparative Example 36 that are illustrated in Fig. 6 was calculated. For obtaining the thermal conductivity, the following values were used. Vf (volume filling ratio of boehmite): volume filling ratio shown in Table 5 λc (thermal conductivity of boehmite-resin composite): thermal conductivity shown in Table 5 λm (thermal conductivity of resin): 0.24 W/m·K ψ of the boehmite of Examples 1, 4, 5, and 7 and Comparative Examples Comparative Examples 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10: 0.795 ψ of the boehmite of Example 27 to Example 29 and Comparative Example 25 to Comparative Example 27: 0.754 ψ of the boehmite of Example 30 to Example 32 and Comparative Example 28 to Comparative Example 30: 0.708 ψ of the boehmite of Example 33 to Example 35 and Comparative Example 31 to Comparative Example 33: 0.362 ψ of the boehmite of Example 36 to Example 38 and Comparative Example 34 to Comparative Example 36: 0.665 Meanwhile, since the boehmite maintains a pre-determined shape until the temperature of about 1300°C, the pre-determined shape did not change by heating at 320°C to 430°C. ψ of the thermal conductive boehmite of the present invention was not different from ψ of the boehmite as a raw material. A graph in which the horizontal axis represents Vf (Vol%) and the vertical axis represent λc was prepared, and Vf and λc of Table 5 were plotted in the graph. Subsequently, "Vf-λc" curve obtained by inserting the above values (n is a value which is obtained as 3 ÷ ψ) and the thermal conductivity λf of any boehmite to the Mathematical Formula 1 was overlaid on the graph, and the "Vf-λc" curve closest to the plot was selected from the "Vf-λc" curves. Then, the λf value inserted to obtain the corresponding "Vf-λc" curve was obtained as the thermal conductivity of the high thermal conductive boehmite of Examples and the non-treated boehmite of Comparative Examples. The calculated value shown in each drawing, which is obtained from the "Vf-λc" curve closest to the plot, is in good match with the measured value. The thermal conductivity of the high thermal conductive boehmite of Examples and the thermal conductivity of the non-treated boehmite of Comparative Examples are as described below. The thermal conductivity of the high thermal conductive boehmite has a value which is about 2.4 to 3.3 times higher than the thermal conductivity of the non-treated boehmite of Comparative Examples.
