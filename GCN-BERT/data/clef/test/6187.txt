FLOOR DRAIN COVER Description TECHNICAL FIELD: The present invention relates to a cover, more particular, to a floor drain cover that is mounted on the floor to cover a floor drain. Solid cover then it closed prevents bad smells and insects to enter the room through drain as well as it prevents debris from entering into the drain and clogging the same. BACKGROUND ART: Such a similar device is already previously known from the US 6,802,962, having a removable hinge at one end and a removable locking mechanism opposite the hinge. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The invention (Floor Drain Cover) will be described and explained in greater detail in the following, using an exemplary embodiment shown in the drawings. FIG. 1 depicts the cover (100) which includes the stationary frame (1), the rotating plate (2) and the button (3) assembled on the pick edge. FIG. 2 depicts the cover (100) in a closed position from a bottom view which includes a stationary frame (1), a rotating plate (2), the axis (4) and the spring (5). FIG. 3 depicts the cover (100) in an open position which includes the stationary frame (1), the rotating plate (2) and the button (3). FIG. 4 depicts the cover (100) in an open position from a bottom view which includes the stationary frame (1), the rotating plate (2), and the spring (5). THE INVENTION: In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a floor drain cover (] ()()), comprising a stationary draining frame (1 ) having an open slots (1 1) on top wall and an open bottom wall, a rotating movable plate (2) hinged mounted to the frame (1) and movable relative to it, and a snap action spring (5) mounted on the frame (1) and connected to the rotating movable plate (2). The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a floor drain cover (100) that can prevent bad smells, waste water and insects to enter the room through drain as well as it can prevent debris from entering into the drain and clogging the same. According to the primary objective of the present invention, when the rotating/movable plate/lid (2) is closed to seal the bottom wall of the draining stationary frame/plate (1) and to interrupt the connection between the draining stationary frame/plate (1) and the floor drain, thereby preventing the ambient bad smel l and waste water in the floor drain from flowing backward into the draining frame/plate and thereby preventing the room floor from being contaminated by the ambient bad smell and waste water. Moreover, before rotatmg/movable plate (2) is opened for hose down, debris is brushed away easily and therefore preventing floor dram from clogging. A rotating/movable plate/lid (2) can be opened easily by pushing down one of the slots (1 1 ) till spring (5) snaps it to the opened position. From the opened position, as shown for example in FIG. 3, the rotatmg/movable plate/lid (2) can be closed by pressing down the button (3) till spring snaps (5) it to the closed position, as shown for example in FIG. 1. FIG. number 4 describes the floor dram cover (100) from a bottom view. The rotating moveable plate (2) is affixed by axis (4) to the bottom side of the stationary draining frame (1). The movable plate (2) therefore can be moved and by that to close the slots (1 1) when in a closed position or to open them when in an open position. The snap action spring (5) is attached to the frame (1 ) and to the plate (2), and by that the plate can be in two positions: open or closed. One part of the spring (5) is attached to vertical walls (12) of the frame (1) and other part of the spring (5) is attached to a niche (21) of a main vertical wall (22) of the plate (2). The floor dram cover (100) can be inserted on the drain of the floor and can be in a closed position. In closed position, the plate (2) closed the slots ( 1 1) of the frame (1 ). The user can press, for example by his fingers, on the plate (2) through the slots (1 1) and to change the position of the spring (5) in a way that the cover (100) can be in an open position. In this case, the pick edge (221) of the main vertical wall (22) protrudes through one of the slots (1 1 ). This pick edge (221) can be covered by the button (3). When the user wish to closed the cover (100) he can simply push down the pick edge (221 ) to change the position of the spring (5) to a closed position. FIG. 1 depicts the cover (100) which includes the stationary frame (1), the rotating plate (2) and the button (3) assembled on the pick edge. FIG. 2 depicts the cover (100) in a closed position from a bottom view which includes the stationary frame (1), the rotating plate (2), the axis (4) and the spring (5). FIG. 3 depicts the cover (100) in an open position which includes the stationary frame (1), the rotating plate (2) and the button (3). FIG. 4 depicts the cover (100) in an open position from a bottom view which includes the stationary frame (1), the rotating plate (2), and the spring (5).
