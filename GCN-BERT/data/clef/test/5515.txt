This invention relates to the ,lever arrangement of pressing rollers the object being to allow the pressing rollers to be removed with a minimum amount of time and trouble through not having to slacken off the nuts under neath the spring, thus also insuring that the weighted lever always comes hack to its set position, keeping the pressure on the roner constant. The improved mechanism consists of the lever A, the fork part of bracket B, the bracket C. the strap D, the socket E and the pin P. Referring to the accompanying drawing, A is a lever hinged to the small bracket C and passing through a slot in the strap D and also through the forked part of the bracket B. The strap D extends from the tail part of the socket E, down through the rail H and the lever L, and is screwed to suit the nuts N supporting the spring M. When the lever A is lifted and rested in the notch 0 (shown in Figure 2), it lifts the strap D just enough to allow the tail part of the socket E to clear the hook part of the strap D. The socket E is free to turn on the spindle of the roller F, so that when the handle is gripped to remove the roller it swings round taking the tail part of the socket E clear of the hook of the strap D, now the roller is free to be lifted out. When the roller has been put back again and the handle part of the socket E let go the socket swings back bringing the tail part underneath the hook of the strap again so that when the lever A is relieved they engage with one another, and the whole pressure of the weight K on the lever L is brought to bear on the roller F. The lever A being hinged at the back of the strap D rests on the bottom of the fork of bracket B when not in use, therefore preventing any interference with the pressure on the roller F. The small pin P prevents the weight K from being shifted on the lever L, hence keeping tile pressure constant, through not having to slacken off the nuts N when relieving the pressure on the roller F by means of the ]ever A the lever L comes back to the same position in the staple J when he pressure is brought to hear on the roller F again. 1. In the mechanism referred to a lever hinged in such a way so that when lifted and rested in the notched bracket it relieves the pressure on the roller substantially as described and illustrated. 2. In the mechanism referred to a socket free to turn on the roller spindle with a tail piece with aperture, and a handle so set that when the handle is upright he tail is clear of the strap, and, when the handle is relieved the weigh and setting of the said handle and tail piece brings the tail back into position to be onnected with the strap, substantially as described and illustrated. 3. In the mechanism referred to the connecting of the socket and strap underneath the roller spindle substantially as described and illustrated. 4 In the mechanism referred to a pin to prevent the weight being shifted on the lever substantially as described and illustrated. 5. The improved lever arrangement or mechanism substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings. HENRY PATERSON. Dated *he 20th day o[ April 1925.
