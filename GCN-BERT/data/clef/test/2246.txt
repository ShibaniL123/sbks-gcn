Field of Invention The present invention relates to a composition for a flexible substrate. More particularly, the present invention relates to a composition for a flexible substrate having anti-yellowing and heat-resistant properties and a flexible substrate formed by the same. 2. Description of Related Art In recent years, organic polymers materials have been widely applied in various electrical elements or devices for increasing various properties (for example, electrical insulation, heat resistance, mechanical properties and so on). Among those polymers, polyimide polymer is the most commonly applied in related industries due to its excellently mechanical and electrical properties. WO 2009/107429 discloses a polyimide precursor composition for transparent flexible substrate. The polyimide precursor is formed by reacting diamine (comprising fluorene-containing benzidine and 1,4-cyclohexyldiamine) and tetracarboxylic dianhydride. The aforementioned composition is used to form a flexible substrate with high transparency. However, during the process of heating the polyimide precursor, the cured and formed polyimide has yellowing problem under high temperatures so that such polyimide cannot satisfy the requirement of this industrial field. Therefore, there is a need to provide a composition for a flexible substrate and flexible substrate, so as to improving the aforementioned disadvantages of the prior composition and flexible substrate. SUMMARY Accordingly, an aspect of the invention provides a composition for a flexible substrate, which comprises a polymer (A), an inorganic oxide particle (B), a silane compound containing an amino group (C) and a solvent (D).

The aforementioned solvent of the dehydration/ring-closing reaction can be the same as or different from the solvent used in the composition for the flexible substrate rather than being recited repetitively. Preferably, based on the a usage amount of the polyamic add resin as 100 parts by weight, a usage amount of the solvent of the dehydration/ring-closing reaction is 200 part by weight to 2,000 parts by weight, and more preferably 300 part by weight to 1,800 parts by weight. The dehydrating agent used in the dehydration/ring-closing reaction includes: (1) acid anhydride compounds: acetic anhydride, propionic anhydride or trifluoroacetic anhydride, and a usage amount of such dehydrating agent is generally 0.01 mole to 20 moles based on the usage amount of the polyamic acid resin as 1 mole. Moreover, the catalyst used in the dehydration/ring-closing reaction includes: (1) pyridine compounds: pyridine, trimethylpyridine, dimethylpyridine or the like; and (2) tertiary amines: triethylamine or the like. A usage amount of the catalyst is generally 0.5 moles to 10 moles based on the usage amount of the dehydrating agent as 1 mole.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Preparation of Polymer (A) The polymer (A) was prepared by Synthesis Examples A-1-1 to A-2-10 according to TABLE 1. Synthesis Example A-1-1 A 500 mL four-necked flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet, a stirrer, a condenser and a thermometer was purged with nitrogen, and the following components were charged to the flask. The aforementioned components comprising 5.4 g (0.05 moles) of p-diaminobenzene (b-1) and 70 g (0.05 moles) of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (hereinafter abbreviated to NMP) were stirred to dissolve completely under room temperature (e.g. 25° C.). Next, 10.919 (0.05 moles) of pyromellitic dianhydride (a-1) and 30 g of NMP were added into the reaction solution and reacted under room temperature (e.g. 25° C.) for 2 hours. After the reaction was terminated, the reaction solution was poured into 1500 mL of water for precipitating the polymer. After filtering the obtained polymer, the collected polymer was repetitively rinsed by methanol and filtered in three times. And then, the product was dried in a vacuum oven at 60° C., thereby obtaining a polymer (A-1-1). The imidization ratio of the polymer (A-1-1) was determined by using the following evaluation methods and resulted in TABLE 1. The detection method of the imidization ratio was described as follows. Synthesis Examples A-1-2 to A-1-5 Synthesis Examples A-1-2 to A-1-5 were practiced with the same method as in Synthesis Example A-1-1 by using different kinds and different amounts of the components of the polymer (A-1-1).

Imidization Ratio The imidization ratio was referred to a ratio of the imide ring, which was calculated according to the total amount of the number of the amic acid group and the number of the imide ring in the polyimide polymer, and the ratio of the imide ring was represented as percentage. Each of the polymers (A-1-1) to (A-2-10) of Synthesis Examples A-1-1 to A-2-10 was dried under a reduced pressure and then dissolved in an appropriate deuterated solvent (e.g. deuterated dimethylsulfoxide). 1H-NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance) results of the polymers (A-1-1) to (A-2-10) were measured under room temperature (e.g. 25° C.) by using tetramethylsilane as a reference standard, and the imidization ratio (%) of the polymers (A-1-1) to (A-2-10) were calculated according to Equation (IV) as below: Imidization ⁢ ⁢ Ratio ⁡ ( % ) = [ 1 - Δ1 Δ ⁢ ⁢ 2 × α ] × 100 ⁢ % ( IV ) In the Equation (IV), the Δ1 was referred to a peak area produced by chemical shift around 10 ppm of the proton of the NH group, the Δ2 was referred to a peak area of other protons, and the α was referred to a number ratio of the proton number of NH group to the number of other protons in the polyamic acid precursor of those polymers. 2. Transparency Each of the composition for the flexible substrate of Examples 1 to 14 and Comparative Examples 1 to 8 was coated onto a 100 mm*100 mm glass base plate by using the spin-coating method, and then prebaked at 80° C. for 20 minutes to form a prebaked coating film with thickness of 30 μm. Next, those prebaked coating film were postbaked at 300° C. for 60 minutes, so as to obtain a laminate including a flexible substrate disposed on the glass base plate. Transmittance (%) of each flexible substrate of the laminate was measured by using a spectrophotometer (Model No. U-3310, manufactured by Hitachi) at a wavelength of 400 nm and evaluated according to the following criterion: ⊚: 90%<transmittance; ◯: 85%<transmittance≦90%; Δ: 80%<transmittance≦85%; x: transmittance≦0%. 3.

Next, those prebaked coating film were postbaked at 300° C., so as to obtain a laminate including a flexible substrate disposed on the glass base plate. Thermal yellowing resistance of each flexible substrate of the laminate was measured after being postbaked for 30 minutes or 60 minutes by visual inspection, and evaluated according to the following criterion: ⊚: no yellowing, appeared after being postbaked for 30 minutes or 60 minutes; ◯: no yellowing appeared after being postbaked for 30 minutes, but little yellowing appeared after being postbaked for 60 minutes; x: significant yellowing appeared after being postbaked for 30 minutes or 60 minutes.
