ii'!i 3o . • :i¸ This inventìon relates to therapeutic compositions» and more particularly to therapeutic compositions containing codeine and codeine-like drugs which produce a longer-acting and potentiated response. More particularly» the compositions of the present invention contemplate the inclusion of codeine, and codeine-like compounds which are potentiated by the addition of quinazolones. The invention relates to compositions including codeine, and codeine-like compounds per se, with the above mentioned quinazolones per se, and also includes such compounds in the form of resinate complexes, as will be more fully described hereafter. Codeine has long been used in the medical field for its analgesic properties. While it has only moderate oral analgestic properties, it has been employed, particularly in combination with acetylsalicyllc acid, phenacetin, and caffeine compounds. Such mixtures, however, must be administered every few hours in order to provide a patient with any prolonged release from pain. As a result, the medical profession has long sought a preparation which would produce a long-acting and potentiated response. An object of the present invention is to provide therapeutic compositions which have a longer-actoEng and more powerful analgesic effect than codeine alone It is another object of the present invention to provide compositions which are delayed in their absorption with the resulting reduced toxicity and prolongation of the drug action such compositions being obtained by combining codeine and the quinazolones mentioned above in the form of a resin complex o resinate. JG l0 -»- 635309 In accordance with the present invention, the above and other objects which will become apparent hereinafter, areæcomplîshed by a composition comprising codeine, or a coòelne-llke drug, and one or more of the qulnazolones of the type mentioned belox«. ?Je have also found that methyl atropine will potentiate the analgesic activity of codeine. Suitable quinazolone compounds are one or more compounds of the group consisting of q ìnazolones and theìr salts (including the resonates), the quinazolone in base form having the following general formula: N R I ",,,oS Il in which R is an aromatic or heterocyclic nucleus which may be substituted by monovalent groups: for example, nitro, halogen, such as chlorine, bromine, and the like; alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, amyl, lauryl, stearyl, and the like; alkoxy, such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, and the like; X is hydrogen or alkyl, as above; and Y is an aliphatic radical such as alkyl, as above; and alkylamlno such as methylamlno, ethylamino, and the lìke; an aromatic radical, and substituted aromatic radicals, such as phenyl, tolyl, toluyl, anisyl, phenetyl, o-nitrophenyl, m-nltrophenyl, p-nitrophenyl, p chlorophenyl, naphthyl, and the 2Lke; aralkyl, such as phenethyl, phenylamino; or arallphatlc, such as benzyl, and the like. There Y is an i i¸ • i!: : •i » : "" • "" i " / --4-- l0 3o 53o9 aromatic radical, such radical may be substituted by alkyl groups having 1-6 carbon atoms. The aromatic or heterocyclic nucleus represented by the character R may be benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, anthraquinone, dibenzofurane, carbazole, bisphenylene, and the like. The acid addition salts of these compounds are also included within the present invention. Some examples of the acid addition salts of the free base with inorganic or organic acids which may be prepared by the methods hereinafter described are the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydrolodide, sulfate, phosphate, maleate, acetate, citrate, oxalate, succinate, benzoate, tartrate, phthalate, and the like. The resinates, and particularly the reacted products of the above suitable quinazolones with a sulfonic acid cation exchange resin are also suitable. These sulfonic acid resinates Eave a much longer lasting effect than the resinates made with carboxylic acid cation exchange resins. To facilitate a fuller and more complete nderstanding of how the principles of this invention may be applied, certain specific examples follow herewith. It is clearly to be understood, however, that these examples are provided by way of illustration only, and that they are not to be construed as imposing any limitations upon the invention as defined in the subjoined claims.

In general, the compounds of the present invention may be prepared by either o£ two methods. The first, in general, involves the heating of N-acyl-o-amlno-cycllc carboxylic acid with a primary milne in a suitable solvent in the presence o£ phosphorus trlchlorlde or phosphorus oxychloride. The phosphorus coEride, preferably diluted with a small amount o£ the solvent employed, is added slowly and portionwlse to the solution of the other c raponents. The degree of heating to effect the reaction will depend on the nature o£ the reactants. Preferably, the temperature is one at which the reaction mixture refluxes, although lower temperatures may be employed. The second method involves the preparation o£ the compounds, such as shown in Examples 1-6, by the reaction of the corresponding amide with thionyl chloride in a suitable solvent, and the addition o£ a benzoate to form the corresponding amide, which is then cõnverted to the desired quinazolone. In general, it has been found that doses between lO and 400 rags. are effective for producing the therapeutic results set forth above. In particular, it has been found that the above compounds, when absorbed upon and ionlcally bound with a sulfonlc acid cation exchange resin, produce a long acting effect for a period of at least 8 to 12 hours. An example of dosage form of 2-n!ethyl-3-orthotolyl (3H)-quinazolone bound on a sulfonic acid ion exchange resin is as follows: -i2635309 lO 3o To 370 gros. of moist Amberlite IR-120 resin (225 gros. of dry resin) suspended in distilled »cater was added an amount of 2-methyl-5-orthotolyl-L (SH)- quinazolone sufficient to yield a product containing appropriately 40 per cent 2-methyl-3-orthotolyl-4 ( )- quinazolone. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours, filtered, and drìed for 15 hours at óO°C. The drug-resin complex was found to contain 41 per cent 2-methyl-3orthotolyl- ( 3H) -quinazolone. All sulfonic acid cation exchange resins are suitable for reaction with the compounds disclosed herein to provide the pharmaceutically effective adsorption compounds. The tenul "sulfonic acid cation exchange resin" is intended to include the phenol sulfonic acid cation exchange resins and the carboxylic-sulfonic acid cation exchange resins, as well as the ordinary sulfonic acid cation exchange resins. However, particularly satisfactory results have been obtained with the sulfonic acid cation exchange resins disclosed in D'Alelio U. S. Patent No. 2,366,007, such resins being sulfonated polymerizates of polyvinyl aryl compounds. Other suitable cation exchange resins are dïsclosed in U. S. Patents Nos. 2,204,539; 2,338,].59; and 2,729,607. The cross linkage of the sulfonic acid resins is suitably between 3 per cent and 17 per cent, and preferably between 5 per cent to i0 per cent, to obtain the most effective slow rate of diffusion of stomach and intestinal juices into the resin. The particle size of the resins is of lesser importance, but improved slowing down effect is obtained with a particle size between 20 to mesh over that of finer particle, such as 200 mesh. -13çS5309 • i .z. lO An illustrated formula of a suitable cation exchange resin adsorption product of au amine is given below, A representing a resin nucleus: c - H2 - c6R5 l C - H l c - ï 3 The resin adsorption compounds of this invention are preferably substantially saturated with the supine. Saturation will generally run from about 30 per cent to per cent, depending upon the amine and the time of contact with the sulfonic acid catìon exchange resin. However, the resin does not necessarily have to be saturated, and as little as lO per cent and less of the adsorption amine can be OEsed. The resin adsorption products can be readily made by agitating the ingredients suspended in water until the reaction is complete. In the examples, IR-120 refers to a s lfonlc acid cation exchange resin, 7 per cent to 8 per cent cross-linked, having a particle size such that substan ially all particles pass through a 20 mesh screen and are retained on a 50 mesh screen, and made in accordance with Example 1 of U. S. Patent No. 2,366,007, except that 7.5 parts of divinyl benzene are used instead of the l0 parts. XE-69 refers to the same resin as IR-120 except that substantially all particles pass through an 80 mesh screen and are retained on a I00 mesh screen. ii: i 9! l0 3o -14g3 SO, ) PREPARATION OF CODEINE RESIN COMPLEX Example 12. Place 34.66 Ibs. of Amberlite Resin XE-69 in sack in the reaction tank. 35 gallons of deionized water is added and then hydrochloric acid, C.P. conc., is added to bring pH to one to 2 under agitation. Continue agitation for 30 minutes, drain tank, add 25 gallons of deionized water and drain tank; add 35 gallons of deionized water. Next, 11.82 lbs. of codeine is added and then is agitated for 3 hours and allowed to stand overnight. Supernatmut liquid is removed and 35 gallons of water added and agitated for 15 minutes, allowed to stand, and supernatant decanted. Repeat 3 more toemes. The cake is sucked to dryness, transferred to trays, and dried at 128@F. overnight. Oake then is fed through Fitzpatrlc with No. 2 screen. PREPARATION OF ETHYL ATROPINE-RESIN0MPLEX Example 13. Add 220 gros. of XE-69 resin to one liter of 3 per cent hydrochl0ride in water and mix for 30 minutes. Decant, wash, and resuspend in 3 liters of water. Add 95 gms. of methyl atropine nitrate and stir slurry for 3 hours. Allow to stand overnight, then stir for additional 2 hours. Decant, wash, and oven dry at 60@F. mg/kg of codeine sulfate showed effective analgetic response (greater than 3 sec} at 30 minutes but not after 90 minutes. At 75 mg/kg potency was similar but effective analgesia lasted 90 to 180 minutes. mg/kg of codeine resinate (sulfonic acid cation exchange adsorption compound) produced effective iïlI • • i !!ii i! i•• • • i ili i 635309 lO analgesia equal in intensity to that of 50 mg/kg of codeine as sulfate, but of mmch longer duration (4-12 hr.) thaìa that of even 75 mg/kg of codeine as sulfate. Hence, prolongation of effect is attained. Figure 1 shows the potentiation of codeine analgesia by the addit ion of methylatroplne, and methylatropine as the resin complex. Methylatropine at 5 and lO mg/kg as the nitrate enhanced the analgetic action of mg/kg of codeine as sulfate. 9 mg/kg of methyl-atropine as resinate potentiated the analgetic effect of mg/kg of codeine as resinate. Methylatropine, itself, has substantially no analgesic activity. Figure 2 shows the potentiation of codeine analgesia by the addition of quinazolone compounds described herein, both alone and as resin complexes. The q inazolones which have no analgetic properties in doses of mg/kg increased the analgetic activity of 50 and lO0 mg/kg of codeine as sulfate. When both codeine (lO0 mg/kg) and the quinazolones (20 mg/kg) were given as resinates, the analgesic activity was increased by an average factor of 3. Increase of the qulnazolone dose te 66 mg/kg increased the factor to 6.4. The specific quinazolone compound shown in Fig. 2 was 2-methyl-3-orthotolyl-4-quinazolone. However, similar potentiation was obtained with other quinazolones above mentioned and the effect is believed to be a general one for analgesic morphine compounds and tranquilizing q inazelones. The prolongation of therapeutic activity of a number drugs has been achieved by reacting them with :i v« k -16635309 lO 3o appropriate synthetic ion exchangers. Where the drug resinate exhibits prolongation of action, it is less toxic than the soluble salt form when compared on a "free" drug basis. The above results were obtained by the D'Amour and Smith apparatus and technique for analgesiometrlc measurement in the rat. A 300, watt AC projection lamp at 95-100 volts as a heat source was used. Two groups of lO animals each were placed in the dolorometer and their response time measured. The voltage was adjusted so that mean baseline response time was of the order of 2 sec. The voltage was then kept constant throughout the experimental period. The pre-treatment response time of each animal was measured 3 times. The average of see nd and third values was taken as the animal' s baseline response time. Drugs were ven by gavage as aqueous solutions or suspensions at a 5 per cent dose volume. Response time was measured 3OmLinutes after d0 s1 ng and then at intervals usually one hour apart, Ten seconds was the maximal• stimulus time in any measurement. For each animal, baseline response time was subtracted from each post-dose• response time ( z sec). This value less 32 sec (the criterion of minimum analgesic) was multiplied by hours elapsed after administration of the dose ( sec hr) and totaled ( sec hr) for each animal. The mean and stand, dev. of Æ sec. hr. of test and control groups were calculated. "Students t" test was used to demonstrate whether the difference of the means was s tatÆeticmlly •significant.
