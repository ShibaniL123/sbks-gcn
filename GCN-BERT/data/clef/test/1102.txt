Comparative Example 6: Synthesis of racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.dibenzoate
2-propanol solution (20.82 g) containing benzoic acid (5.81 g: 47.6 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and 2-propanol solution (9.01 g) containing racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine (3.01 g: 23.9 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.dibenzoate (7.53 g: 20.3 mmol, yield=85%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 140° C., 224° C.
