Example 30. (R)-N-methyl-N-(1-(morpholinosulfonyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine
10.0 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) was added to a 50-mL round-bottomed flask, which was then cooled down in an ice bath (low-temperature bath). After 0.300 mL of sulfuryl chloride (SO2Cl2) was added thereto, a solution of 213 mg of morpholine dissolved in 3.0 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) was slowly added while cooling in the ice bath (low-temperature bath). The reaction mixture was treated with 520 mg of trimethylamine and then stirred for about 2 hours. The resulting reaction product was dissolved with 20.0 mL of chloroform and then washed with 20.0 mL of ice water. The chloroform phase was separated, dried with magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), and then filtered. The resulting filtrate was distilled under reduced pressure. As a result, 160 mg of morpholine-4-sulfonyl chloride was obtained with a yield of about 23.3%.
70.0 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 5-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 1.00 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 0.0390 mL of morpholine-4-sulfonyl chloride was added thereto, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0590 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine and then stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 47.0 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(1-(morpholinosulfonyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was obtained with a yield of about 40.2%.
