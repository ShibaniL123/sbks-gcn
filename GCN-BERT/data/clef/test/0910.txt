FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to a fixed dose pharmaceutical composition comprising iron chelating agents, a process for preparing such a pharmaceutical composition and the use of the said pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of chronic iron overload. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART Thalassemias are inherited autosomal recessive disorders characterised by the reduced rate of hemoglobin synthesis due to a defect in the α or β globin chain synthesis. Chronic iron overload occurs commonly in patients with beta-thalassemia major (TM) mainly due to frequent blood transfusions that are carried out at the rate of approximately 0.5 mg/kg body weight per day for the management of several conditions including β-thalassemia, sickle cell disease and myelodysplastic syndromes. Each unit of blood contains iron and since the human body has no physiological mechanism to actively excrete the excess iron, repeated blood transfusions result in excessive accumulation of iron. This excess of iron deposited in body tissues can cause severe damage to vital organs such as liver, heart and the endocrine organs such as the hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid and parathyroid glands as well as the gonads. This may ultimately lead to many complications including cardiomyopathy, liver cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus and eventually reduced life expectancy. Chelation therapy is generally started when transfusion dependent patients have received 10-12 transfusions or when the ferritin is constantly greater than 1000 mg/L. Ferritin is a ubiquitous intracellular protein that stores iron and releases it in a controlled fashion. The amount of ferritin stored reflects the amount of iron stored. Serial ferritin levels provide better indication of iron loading as compared to random ferritin measurement. Compliance with chelation therapy is a major predictor of long-term morbidity and mortality. Current options for chelation are desferrioxamine, deferiprone and deferasirox and in some cases combinations of chelating agents. Desferrioxamine has been the most widely used chelator though there is increasing experience with deferiprone and deferasirox. Deferasirox is an orally active iron chelator and has been approved for the treatment of iron overload in transfusion dependent anemia's (transfusion hemosiderosis) particularly thalassemia major, thalassemia intermediate and in sickle cell disease to reduce iron-related morbidity and mortality in patients having an age of two years and older. Deferasirox has the chemical name 4-[3,5-bis(2-hydroxyphenyl)-[1,2,4]triazol-1-yl]enzoic acid, and is reported to have the following chemical structure. Deferasirox mobilizes tissue iron by forming soluble stable complexes that are then excreted in the faeces. It is a tridentate iron chelator requiring two molecules of the drug to form a stable complex. Iron is chelated both from the reticuloendothelial cells (RE cells) as well as various parenchymal tissues. The chelated iron is cleared by the liver and excreted through the bile. It also has the ability to prevent the myocardial cell iron uptake by removing iron directly from myocardial cells. Deferasirox is commercially available as a dispersible tablet (EXJADE®) for oral administration. EXJADE® is supplied as a dispersible tablet containing 125 mg, 250 mg and 500 mg of deferasirox per tablet. Deferasirox is administered as a once daily oral iron chelator, which is prescribed as a dispersible tablet, i.e., a tablet which needs to be dispersed in an aqueous medium prior to administration. Deferasirox is highly water-insoluble and is highly lipid-soluble, and is also observed to possess good permeability. According to the Bio-pharmaceutics Classification System (BCS), it has been classified as a Class II drug, implying that it is a poorly soluble and a highly permeable drug. Though deferasirox is highly water-insoluble, whatever limited solubility it has, that too exhibits a high pH-dependent solubility. Though it is practically insoluble in lower pH, even at a pH of 6.8, it still remains insoluble, until the buffer strength is altered to get optimal dissolution profile. Deferasirox being practically insoluble in aqueous media exhibits a generally poor dissolution profile and hence consequently poor bioavailability. Deferiprone, chemically known as (3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethylpyridin-4-one) is an orally active, iron-chelating agent and is represented by the following chemical structure. Deferiprone exhibits an affinity for ferric ion (iron III). Deferiprone binds with ferric ions to form neutral 3:1 (deferiprone:iron) complexes that are stable over a wide range of pH values. Deferiprone is indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusional iron overload due to thalassemia syndromes when current chelation therapy is inadequate. The recommended initial dose of Deferiprone is 25 mg/kg, orally, three times per day for a total of 75 mg/kg/day. The maximum dose is 33 mg/kg, three times per day for a total of 99 mg/kg/day. Deferiprone is commercially available as FERRIPROX® for oral administration and are supplied as 500 mg film coated capsule-shaped tablets. Deferiprone is sparingly soluble in water (12.95 mg/ml) and, less than 10% of the ingested dose is excreted as the active form, the majority of the drug being excreted as the inactive glucuronide metabolite.

WO2009067557 discloses a process of preparing deferasirox formulations having sufficiently high dissolution rate and good bioavailability wherein the said process comprises co-milling deferasirox with at least two pharmaceutically acceptable excipients in the absence of any solvent.

This article highlights the concerns regarding the compliance issues of deferoxamine. The article further states that the efficacy and safety of the combination of deferiprone and deferasirox in a trial may determine whether this combination could be a useful option in tailoring individual chelation therapy for thalassemia major (TM) patients with iron overload. The above documents disclose deferasirox and deferiprone separately in various types of pharmaceutical formulations, but it has been observed that there still exist problems with such formulations, particularly in terms of the high frequency of administration, associated patient compliance problems and also the overall cost of the medication. These prior arts do not reveal any compositions in the form of a fixed dose which is administered as a single unit dose or single dosage form. Envisaging the problems of the prior art, the inventors of the present invention have developed a pharmaceutical composition which eliminates or substantially minimises these problems, leading to improved patient compliance, a reduction in the frequency of administration, and also reduced medication costs.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a fixed dose pharmaceutical composition comprising iron chelating agents having synergistic effect. Another object of the present invention is to provide a fixed dose pharmaceutical composition comprising iron chelating agents having a reduced dose.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Patients with thalassemia major accumulate body iron over time as a consequence of continuous red blood cell transfusions which cause hepatic, endocrine, and cardiac complications. Despite the availability of iron chelators, some patients fail to respond adequately to monotherapy with any of them. Combination therapy, consisting in the use of two iron chelators on the same day, has been introduced to increase the efficacy and to induce negative iron balance in patients with severe iron overload. Extensive long-term experience has shown that combined iron chelation therapy rapidly reduces liver iron, serum ferritin, and myocardial siderosis, improves cardiac function, reverses and prevents endocrine complications, reduces cardiac mortality, and improves survival. Such combination therapy may involve different dosage regimens as well as different frequencies of administration of the iron chelators and thus it generally may result in non-completion of therapy leading to the worsening of underlying disease as a result of such non-compliance, which is especially observed in geriatric and pediatric patients. Efforts to improve such compliance have been aimed at by simplifying the medication packaging, providing effective medication reminders, improving patient education, and limiting the number of medications prescribed simultaneously. However, such efforts have not been able to completely resolve the drawbacks associated with patient compliance. The present invention provides a fixed dose pharmaceutical composition comprising iron chelating agents which would ensure patient compliance due to simplification of therapy. The term fixed dose refers to a combination of two active ingredients in a single dosage form or single unit dose. Iron chelating agents for use in the composition of the invention include, but are not limited to, deferasirox and deferiprone. The present invention thus provides a fixed dose pharmaceutical composition comprising a combination of deferasirox and deferiprone. Potential advantages of such fixed dose combinations include an improvement of the benefit/risk assessment due to addition or potentiation of therapeutic activities of their substances, which results in a level of efficacy similar to the one achievable by each active substance used alone at higher doses than in combination. Further, they are associated with a better safety profile or a level of efficacy above the one achievable by a single substance with an acceptable safety profile. Another advantage is the counteracting by one substance of an adverse reaction produced by another one. It will be understood, however, that specific dose level and frequency of dosage of the combination according to the invention for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy. The term “Deferasirox” is used in broad sense to include not only “Deferasirox” per se but also its pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof. Suitable derivatives include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, pharmaceutically acceptable isomers, pharmaceutically acceptable esters, pharmaceutically acceptable anhydrates, pharmaceutically acceptable enantiomers, pharmaceutically acceptable polymorphs, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, pharmaceutically acceptable tautomers and/or pharmaceutically acceptable complexes thereof. The term “Deferiprone” is used in broad sense to include not only “Deferiprone” per se but also its pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof. Suitable derivatives include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, pharmaceutically acceptable isomers, pharmaceutically acceptable esters, pharmaceutically acceptable anhydrates, pharmaceutically acceptable enantiomers, pharmaceutically acceptable polymorphs, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, pharmaceutically acceptable tautomers and/or pharmaceutically acceptable complexes thereof.

A tablet formulation is the preferred solid dosage form due to its greater stability, less risk of chemical interaction between different medicaments, smaller bulk, accurate dosage, and ease of production. According to one embodiment, the fixed dose pharmaceutical composition, according to the present invention, may be administered as a multilayer tablet, preferably a bilayer tablet, wherein each layer separately contains a drug and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are then compressed to give a bilayer tablet. According to another embodiment, the fixed dose pharmaceutical composition, according to the present invention, may be administered as granules directly or filled into capsules or sachets. According to a preferred embodiment, the fixed dose pharmaceutical composition, according to the present invention, may be administered as a dispersible tablet. The inventors of the present invention have further observed that the solubility properties of iron chelating agents were improved by nanosizing resulting in better solubility thus leading to better bioavailability of the drug. Nanosization of hydrophobic or poorly water-soluble drugs generally involves the production of drug nanocrystals through either chemical precipitation (bottom-up technology) or disintegration (top-down technology). Different methods may be utilized to reduce the particle size of the hydrophobic or poorly water soluble drugs. [Huabing Chen et al., discusses the various methods to develop nanoformulations in “Nanonization strategies for poorly water-soluble drugs,” Drug Discovery Today, Volume 00, Number 00, March 2010]. The present invention thus provides a fixed dose pharmaceutical composition comprising deferasirox and deferiprone wherein deferasirox and deferiprone have an average particle size of less than or equal to about 2000 nm, preferably less than or equal to about 1000 nm. The term average particle size as used herein refers to the average diameter of the particles. Mostly all particles have a particle size of less than or equal to about 2000 nm, preferably less than or equal to about 1000 nm. The term “particles” as used herein refers to an individual particle of deferasirox, or particles of deferasirox or deferasirox granules or deferasirox compositions and/or mixtures thereof. The particles of the present invention can be obtained by any of the process such as but not limited to milling, precipitation, homogenization, high pressure homogenization, spray-freeze drying, supercritical fluid technology, double emulsion/solvent evaporation, PRINT (Particle replication in non-wetting templates), thermal condensation, ultrasonication and spray drying. Accordingly, the process of milling can comprise dispersing drug particles in a liquid dispersion medium in which the drug is poorly soluble, followed by applying mechanical means in the presence of grinding media to reduce the particle size of drug to the desired effective average particle size. The fixed dose pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be manufactured by any of the types of processes as described above. Preferably, the process comprises (1) homogenizing deferasirox and/or deferiprone and at least one excipient to produce a homogenized dispersion; and (2) milling the said homogenized dispersion to produce a slurry comprising deferasirox and/or deferiprone particles having an average particle size of less than or equal to about 2000 nm(3) processing the slurry to obtain the desired dosage form.
