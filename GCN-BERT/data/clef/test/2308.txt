Intermediate 15. 8-Bromo-6-chloro-9-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole
8-Bromo-6-chloro-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (5.2 g, 21.75 mmol) in DMF (41 ml) was treated with cesium carbonate (17.72 g, 54.38 mmol) and 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (5.30 g, 22.84 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. Reaction monitoring by LC/MS showed complete conversion to the product. The mixture was admixed with water (20 ml) and extracted with EA (3 x 50 ml). The combined organic phases were washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by preparative RP HPLC. The fractions containing the product were combined and concentrated, and the residue freeze-dried. 1 g (13%) of the title compound were obtained in the form of its salt with trifluoroacetic acid.
