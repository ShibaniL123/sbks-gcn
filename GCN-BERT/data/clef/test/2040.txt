TACTILE FEEDBACK GLOVES TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to simulation gloves for video and computer games, and particularly to tactile feedback gloves incorporating motor-controlled joints and actuator- controlled pressure pins. BACKGROUND ART Efforts have been made to simulate tactile pressure and limited joint motion that occurs during "natural" use of a hand. The simulation efforts are generally in support of telerobotic control, in which it is desirable to have an operator "feel" robotic hand and finger motions as the operator manipulates real or virtual objects with a controller. Examples of manual controllers using levers, grippers, handles and the like, some of which apply force feedback, abound. These types of controllers are not without their drawbacks. Hence, there has been long recognized a need for "natural" dexterous controllers with haptic feedback. Thus, tactile feedback gloves solving the aforementioned problems is desired. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION The tactile feedback gloves each incorporate a plurality of pin actuators disposed inside the glove. The pin actuators point towards bottom surfaces of a user' s hand inside the glove. A plurality of pivotally attached joint members is also disposed inside the glove. The joint members are arranged proximately above top surfaces of a user's hand inside the glove. The pin actuators have a rectangular actuator body with bores sunk through a parallelepiped actuator body surface and arranged in a row-by-column matrix formation of solenoid cores in the bores. The pins slide up and down inside sleeves extending from the solenoid cores. The extent of each pin outside its respective bore is responsive to current flow in the solenoid core. The joint members are arranged above a user's intermediate, proximal, and distal phalanges. Motor control of the joint members determines the angular displacement of the joints, thereby directing or limiting motion of the user's hand inside the glove. These and other features of the present invention will become readily apparent upon further review of the following specification and drawings.

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The tactile feedback glove 100 incorporates a plurality of pin actuators 50 disposed on palmar portions 60a of the glove 100. Fig. 1 shows a single pin actuator 50 disposed on the glove 100 for clarity in the drawing, but it should be understood that the plurality of pin actuators 50 may be disposed on top or underneath any portion of, or all portions of, the palmar glove surfaces 60a. Actuators 50 are attached to the palmar portions 60a such that the pins 40 (shown in Fig. 3) of the actuators 50 point towards and selectively stimulate pressure nerves of the palmar finger surfaces of a user's hand when the glove 100 is worn on the user' s hand. It is contemplated that both right-hand and left-hand gloves may be provided. As most clearly shown in Fig. 3, each pin actuator 50 comprises a rectangular actuator body 20 having blind bores 30 sunk through one surface thereof, extending through a portion of actuator body 20, the bores 30 being arranged in a matrix formation of rows 11 and columns 12 of solenoid cores, each solenoid core being disposed in its respective bore 30 and having a sleeve extending therefrom. The pins 40 are disposed in the sleeves of the solenoid cores 11 and 12 and are coaxially constrained to slide up and down responsive to currents in the solenoid cores 11 and 12. The extent of each pin 40 outside its respective bore 30 is responsive to the intensity of actuation of the solenoid core within the bore 30. While the embodiment shown utilizes electromechanical solenoid core actuation, other forms of actuation, such as compressed air, are contemplated. As shown in Fig. 2, a plurality of pivotally attached joint members 70 is disposed on dorsal portions 60b of the glove 100. The joint members 70 are arranged proximate the dorsal finger joint surfaces (intermediate, proximal, and distal phalanges) of a user's hand inside the glove 100. Planar joint member 22a is positioned on the glove 100 over the dorsal portion of the user's proximal phalange when the glove 100 is worn on the user's hand. Planar joint member 21 is positioned on the glove 100 over the dorsal portion of the user's intermediate phalange when the glove 100 is worn on the user's hand. Planar joint member 22b is positioned on the glove 100 over the dorsal portion of the user's distal phalange when the glove 100 is worn on the user's hand. As most clearly shown in Figs 4A and 4B, the housing of a joint drive motor 96 is attached to the distal end of the planar joint member 22a. Details of the motor 96 and pivotal joint connection via shaft 97 are shown in Fig. 5. The shaft 97 of the joint drive motor 96 forms the pivot axis of a pivotal connection to the proximal end of planar joint member 21. A recess 77 in the proximal end of planar joint member 21 allows for clearance of the cylindrical housing of the motor 96, thereby permitting the joint member 21 to rotate about the pivot axis formed by the attachment to joint member 22a. The rotational position of the motor shaft 97 determines the angular displacement of joint 21 with respect to joint 22a, thereby directing or limiting motion of the user' s intermediate phalange with respect to his/her proximal phalange. The housing of another joint drive motor 96 is attached to the distal end of planar joint member 21. The shaft 97 of the joint drive motor 96 forms the pivot axis of a pivotal connection to the proximal end of planar joint member 22b. A recess 77 in the proximal end of planar joint member 22b allows for clearance of the cylindrical housing of motor 96, thereby permitting the joint member 22b to rotate about the pivot axis formed by the attachment of joint member 21 to joint member 22b. The rotational position of the motor shaft 97 determines the angular displacement of joint 22b with respect to joint 21, thereby directing or limiting motion of the user' s distal phalange with respect to his/her intermediate phalange. With respect to sensing of the joint angular displacements, this technology is described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0157263, published on June 21, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In the present glove 100, the angle sensors 7 (shown in Figs 2, 4A, and 5) are preferably integrated on or within the cylindrical housing of the motor s96. Spatial positioning, e.g., pitch, roll and yaw of the glove 100 (as determined by the position and tilt or attitude of the user's hand) is detected by an X-Y-Z sensor 8, which is disposed on a proximal region of the glove's dorsal surface 60b, and which is connected to a processing and control unit (PCU) 9, as shown in Fig. 2. The PCU 9 can then report the hand position and/or attitude with respect to a virtual environment, such as an electronic game, remote teleoperation environment, and the like. As shown in Fig. 6, processing and control unit (PCU) 9 is connected to angle sensors 7 for determining the joint angles. The PCU 9 is connected to the X-Y-Z sensor 8 for determining spatial positioning, i.e., the pose of the glove 100. Based on inputs from the virtual world, the joint angle sensors 7 and the X-Y-Z sensor 8, the PCU 9 commands desired joint angles and their limits. The motor 96 may have a gear stop formed by a small, e.g., micro-electromechanical solenoid to halt joint motion on command from the PCU 9. For virtual touch sensation, the PCU 9, being connected to the pin actuators 50, controls the pin actuators 50 to regulate the extension of the actuator pins 40.
