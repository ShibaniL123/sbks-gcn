Synthesis of compound 37-d
At 0°C, NaBH4 (530mg, 13.9mmol) was added into a solution of compound 37-e (1.0g, 3.48mmol), LiCl (590mg, 13.9mmol) in THF (40mL) and methanol (20mL). The mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 4hrs, concentrated under reduced pressure. Water (40mL) and DCM (40mL) were added to the residue, the organic phase was seperated, aqueous phase was extracted with DCM (20mL×3). The organic phases were combined, washed in turn with water (20mL×3) and saturated brine (10mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give compound 37-d (750mg, yield 89%). The product was used directly for the next step without further purification.
