CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This patent application claims the priority benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/736,713 filed on Dec. 13, 2012, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present disclosure pertains to a portable handheld pressure support system configured to deliver a pressurized flow of breathable gas to the airway of a subject. 2. Description of the Related Art A positive air pressure (PAP) can be applied to a patient's airway to keep the airway open and avoid collapse during breathing. This positive pressure effectively “splints” the airway, thereby maintaining an open passage to the lungs. Dyspnea, or shortness of breath, is a primary symptom of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD patients may also experience hyperinflation. COPD patients suffer occurrences of dyspnea and/or hyperinflation when exerting themselves. The forms of exertion may include, for example, performing household chores, walking to the local store, or climbing a set of stairs. An onset of dyspnea may limit a patient's ability to perform activities and can trigger apprehension or panic, further reducing the patient's ability to function. Some COPD patients carry short acting bronchodilators to alleviate their symptoms of dyspnea. Bronchodilators are steroid based, typically require 4-20 minutes to act, are mostly effective for only asthmatic-based symptoms, and rely on expensive pharmaceuticals.

Pressure support system 10 is configured to provide the pressure support therapy in the form of a pressurized flow of breathable gas that is delivered to the airway of subject 12. Pressure support system 10 is configured to treat COPD and/or other patients suffering from dyspnea, hyperinflation, and/or other conditions. System 10 is configured to adjust an expiratory pressure level of the pressure support therapy responsive to identification of hyperinflation in subject 12. The pressure support therapy provided to subject 12 is configured to be used as needed (e.g., intermittently) by subject 12 to rapidly alleviate shortness of breath, hyperinflation, and/or other symptoms. Pressure support system 10 is configured to be small and lightweight so that subject 12 may carry system 10 and use system 10 as needed without requiring a device to be worn on the face. The present disclosure contemplates that portable handheld pressure support system 10 may be used to treat symptoms and/or conditions related to dyspnea and/or hyperinflation due to COPD, and/or for other uses. The other uses may include, for example, treating dyspnea related to pulmonary cancer, treating emphysema, treating pneumonia, treating Cheyne-Stokes respiration and/or other disordered breathing, improving the exercise capacity of any patient limited by dyspnea and/or hyperinflation, and/or other uses. Examples of similar portable handheld pressure support systems are described in U.S. Patent Application No. 61/637,586 filed Apr. 24, 2012, entitled “Portable Handheld Pressure Support System and Method”, and/or U.S. Patent Application No. 61/653,052, filed May 30, 2012, entitled “Portable Handheld Blending Gas Enriched Pressure Support System and Method”, the contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, system 10 comprises one or more of a pressure generator 14, a subject interface 16, one or more sensors 18, one or more processors 20, a user interface 22, electronic storage 24, a portable power system 26, a housing 28, a handle 30, and/or other components. Pressure generator 14 is configured to generate a flow of gas for delivery to the airway of subject 12. Pressure generator 14 may control one or more parameters of the flow of gas (e.g., flow rate, pressure, volume, temperature, gas composition, etc.) for therapeutic purposes, and/or for other purposes. By way of a non-limiting example, pressure generator 14 may be configured to control an expiratory pressure level of the flow of gas during and exhalation of the patient to provide pressure support to the airway of subject 12. Pressure generator 14 receives a flow of gas from a gas source, such as the ambient atmosphere, and elevates the pressure of that gas for delivery to the airway of a patient. In some embodiments, pressure generator 14 receives a flow of gas from a gas source through inlet port 15. Pressure generator 14 is any device, such as, for example, a pump, blower, piston, or bellows, that is capable of elevating the pressure of the received gas for delivery to a patient or generating a flow of gas. Pressure generator 14 may comprise one or more valves for controlling the pressure/flow of gas. The present disclosure also contemplates controlling the operating speed of the blower, either alone or in combination with such valves, to control the pressure/flow of gas provided to the patient. In some embodiments, pressure generator 14 may be configured to supply a pressurized flow of breathable gas at pressures between about 1 cm of water and about 40 cm of water. In some embodiments, pressure generator 14 may be configured to supply a pressurized flow of breathable gas at pressures between 2 cm of water and about 30 cm of water. Subject interface 16 is configured to communicate the pressurized flow of breathable gas to the airway of subject 12. As such, subject interface 16 comprises conduit 40, interface appliance 42, filter 43, and/or other components. In some embodiments, filter 43 is configured to filter bacteria and/or other materials. Conduit 40 is configured to convey the pressurized flow of gas to interface appliance 42. Interface appliance 42 is configured to deliver the flow of gas to the airway of subject 12. In some embodiments, interface appliance 42 is configured to be non-invasively engaged by the mouth of subject 12. Non-invasive engagement comprises removably engaging one or more external orifices of the airway of subject 12 (e.g., nostrils and/or mouth) to communicate gas between the airway of subject 12 and interface appliance 42. In some embodiments, interface appliance 42 is removably coupled to conduit 40. Interface appliance 42 may be removed for cleaning and/or for other purposes. In some embodiments, conduit 40 is configured as a mouthpiece to be engaged by the mouth of subject 12. In some embodiments, other non-invasive interface appliances may be configured as interface appliance 42. Some examples of non-invasive interface appliance 42 may comprise, for example, a nasal cannula, a nasal mask, a nasal/oral mask, a full face mask, a total face mask, or other interface appliances that communicate a flow of gas with an airway of a subject. The present disclosure is not limited to these examples, and contemplates delivery of the flow of gas to the subject using any interface appliance. In some embodiments, system 10 may be connected to a classical respiratory circuit (e.g., a six foot hose) such that the classical respiratory circuit functions as subject interface 16. One or more sensors 18 are configured to generate output signals conveying information related to one or more parameters of the gas within system 10. The one or more parameters of the gas within system 10 may comprise gas parameters related to the pressurized flow of breathable gas, breathing parameters related to respiration of subject 12, and/or other parameters. Sensors 18 may comprise one or more sensors that measure such parameters directly (e.g., through fluid communication with the flow of gas in interface appliance 42). Sensors 18 may comprise one or more sensors that generate output signals related to the one or more parameters indirectly. For example, sensors 18 may comprise one or more sensors configured to generate an output based on an operating parameter of pressure generator 14 (e.g., patient flow and/or pressure estimations from motor current, voltage, rotational velocity, and/or other operating parameters), and/or other sensors. The one or more gas parameters of the pressurized flow of breathable gas may comprise, for example, one or more of a flow rate, a volume, a pressure, humidity, temperature, acceleration, velocity, peak inhaled and exhaled flows, peak inspiratory and expiratory pressures, and/or other gas parameters. Breathing parameters related to the respiration of subject 12 may comprise a tidal volume, an expiratory flow limitation, a timing (e.g., beginning and/or end of inhalation, beginning and/or end of exhalation, etc.), a respiration rate, a duration (e.g., of inhalation, of exhalation, of a single breathing cycle, etc.), respiration frequency, peak inhaled and exhaled flows, peak inspiratory and expiratory pressures, and/or other breathing parameters. Although sensors 18 are illustrated in FIG. 1 at a single location in system 10, this is not intended to be limiting. Sensors 18 may comprise sensors disposed in a plurality of locations, such as for example, at various locations within (or in communication with) conduit 40, within pressure generator 14, within (or in communication with) interface appliance 42, and/or other locations. Processor 20 is configured to provide information processing capabilities in system 10. As such, processor 20 may comprise one or more of a digital processor, an analog processor, a digital circuit designed to process information, an analog circuit designed to process information, a state machine, and/or other mechanisms for electronically processing information. Although processor 20 is shown in FIG. 1 as a single entity, this is for illustrative purposes only. In some embodiments, processor 20 may comprise a plurality of processing units. These processing units may be physically located within the same device (e.g., pressure generator 14), or processor 20 may represent processing functionality of a plurality of devices operating in coordination. As shown in FIG. 1, processor 20 is configured to execute one or more computer program modules. The one or more computer program modules may comprise one or more of a parameter module 50, a control module 54, a hyperinflation module 56, an expiratory pressure module 58, and/or other modules. Processor 20 may be configured to execute modules 50, 54, 56, and/or 58 by software; hardware; firmware; some combination of software, hardware, and/or firmware; and/or other mechanisms for configuring processing capabilities on processor 20. It should be appreciated that although modules 50, 54, 56, and 58 are illustrated in FIG. 1 as being co-located within a single processing unit, in embodiments in which processor 20 comprises multiple processing units, one or more of modules 50, 54, 56, and/or 58 may be located remotely from the other modules. The description of the functionality provided by the different modules 50, 54, 56, and/or 58 described below is for illustrative purposes, and is not intended to be limiting, as any of modules 50, 54, 56, and/or 58 may provide more or less functionality than is described. For example, one or more of modules 50, 54, 56, and/or 58 may be eliminated, and some or all of its functionality may be provided by other modules 50, 54, 56, and/or 58. As another example, processor 20 may be configured to execute one or more additional modules that may perform some or all of the functionality attributed below to one of modules 50, 54, 56, and/or 58. Parameter module 50 is configured to determine one or more parameters within system 10. The one or more parameters within system 10 may comprise gas parameters related to the pressurized flow of breathable gas, breathing parameters related to the respiration of subject 12, and/or other parameters. Parameter module 50 is configured to determine the one or more parameters based on the output signals of sensors 18. The information determined by parameter module 50 may be used for controlling pressure generator 14, stored in electronic storage 24, and/or used for other uses. The one or more parameters determined by parameter module 50 may include, for example, one or more of a flow rate, a volume, a pressure, humidity, temperature, acceleration, velocity, a tidal volume, an expiratory flow limitation, a timing (e.g., beginning and/or end of inhalation, beginning and/or end of exhalation, etc.), a respiration rate, a duration (e.g., of inhalation, of exhalation, of a single breathing cycle, etc.), respiration frequency, peak flows, peak pressures, and/or other parameters. Control module 54 is configured to control pressure generator 14 to generate the flow of gas in accordance with a positive pressure support therapy regime. In some embodiments, the positive pressure support therapy regime dictates an inspiratory pressure level and an expiratory pressure level. In positive airway pressure support therapy the pressurized flow of gas generated by the pressure generator is controlled to replace and/or compliment a patient's regular breathing. Positive airway pressure support therapy may be used to maintain an open airway in a patient so that oxygen and carbon dioxide may be exchanged more easily, requiring little and/or no effort from the patient. By way of non-limiting example, control module 54 may control pressure generator 14 such that the pressure support provided to the subject via the flow of gas comprises bi-level positive pressure airway support (BiPAP), proportional positive airway pressure support (PPAP), forced oscillation technique, and/or other types of pressure support therapy. BiPAP provides a first inspiratory pressure (IPAP) and a second, typically lower, expiratory pressure (EPAP) for easier exhalation during ventilation. In some therapy modes (e.g., PPAP), control module 54 may control pressure generator 14 to apply variable pressure support in which the amount of pressure delivered to the patient during inhalation and/or during exhalation is determined and delivered on a breath by breath basis. In some embodiments, control module 54 is configured to control pressure generator 14 to supply a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) to subject 12. The PEEP will help maintain the airway patency. The PEEP level may be adjusted to a value to overcome an intrinsic peep level to provide optimal ventilation to the patient. Optimal ventilation includes maintaining optimal blood oxygen saturation levels and being able to exhale CO2. In some embodiments, an EPAP level and a PEEP level may be similar and/or the same. Control module 54 is configured to control pressure generator 14 based on information related to the output signals from sensors 18, information determined by parameter module 50, information entered by a user to user interface 22, information determined by control module 54 based on previous respiration of subject 12, and/or based on other information. Hyperinflation module 56 is configured to identify hyperinflation during exhalation based on the output signals. Hyperinflation module 56 may identify hyperinflation based on information conveyed by the output signals from sensors 18, parameter information (e.g., breathing parameter information) determined by parameter module 50, and/or other information. For example, hyperinflation module 56 may identify hyperinflation based on information related to a tidal volume, an expiratory flow limitation (e.g., indicated by an expiratory flow rate), a pressure in the lungs of subject 12 at the end of exhalation, and/or other parameters determined by parameter module 50 for one or more breaths by subject 12. In some embodiments, hyperinflation module 56 may be configured to identify hyperinflation based on an analysis by hyperinflation module 56 of the information conveyed by the output signals from sensors 18, the information determined by parameter module 50, and/or other information. For example, hyperinflation module 56 may be configured to compare a first pressure in the lungs at the end of a first exhalation to a second pressure in the lungs at the end of a second exhalation to identify air trapping in the lungs of subject 12. Many COPD patients suffer from airflow obstruction, which leads to incomplete expiration. During exertion, patients with emphysema may experience a significant amount of air trapping, which leads to dynamic hyperinflation with auto-peak end-expiratory pressure phenomenon. Hyperinflation due to incomplete lung emptying, especially with exercise, may lead to a further increase in intra-alveolar pressure and decreased inspiratory capacity. The increased resistance to airflow and higher ventilatory demand, is what causes dynamic hyperinflation and increases the work of breathing. External PEEP in these cases may be used to decrease the work of breathing and relieve dyspnea in patients with COPD. Expiratory pressure module 58 is configured to control pressure generator 14 to adjust an expiratory pressure level of the pressurized flow of breathable gas to relieve hyperinflation during exhalation. Expiratory pressure module 58 is configured to control pressure generator 14 to adjust an expiratory pressure level responsive to identification of hyperinflation by hyperinflation module 56. In some embodiments, the expiratory pressure level is a PEEP level. In some embodiments, expiratory pressure module 58 may be configured to control pressure generator 14 to adjust the positive end expiratory pressure level to reduce and/or eliminate an expiratory flow limitation and/or to provide positive pressure support therapy to relieve symptoms of dyspnea. In some embodiments, expiratory pressure module 58 is configured to control pressure generator 14 to increase and/or decrease the PEEP level to reduce and/or eliminate hyperinflation. Whether the PEEP level is increased and/or decreased is determined by expiratory pressure module 58 based on information conveyed by the output signals from sensors 18, parameter information from parameter module 50 (e.g., information related to a tidal volume, an expiratory flow rate that indicates a flow limitation, a pressure at the end of exhalation), and/or other information. For example, expiratory pressure module 58 may be configured to control pressure generator 14 to increase the PEEP level responsive to the information described above indicating hyperinflation, and reduce the PEEP level responsive to the information described above indicating no hyperinflation, and/or indicating reduced hyperinflation. In some embodiments, the increase and/or decrease in the PEEP level is proportional to a level of hyperinflation determined by expiratory pressure module 58. The level of hyperinflation may be determined by expiratory pressure module 58 based on information conveyed by the output signals from sensors 18, parameter information from parameter module 50, and/or other information. By way of a non-limiting example, expiratory pressure module 58 may be configured to control pressure generator 14 to increase the PEEP level by delivered to subject 12 by a relatively large amount responsive to determining a relatively high level of hyperinflation in subject 12. Expiratory pressure module 58 may be configured to control pressure generator 14 to increase the PEEP level by delivered to subject 12 by a relatively small amount responsive to determining a relatively low level of hyperinflation in subject 12. In some embodiments, expiratory pressure module 58 may be configured to control pressure generator 14 to decrease and/or leave the PEEP level unchanged responsive to determining a relatively low level of, and/or no hyperinflation in subject 12. In some embodiments, expiratory pressure module 58 is configured to adjust the PEEP level based on information conveyed by the output signals from sensors 18, parameter information from parameter module 50, and/or other information determined during a single exhalation of subject 12. In some embodiments, expiratory pressure module 58 is configured to adjust the PEEP level based on information conveyed by the output signals from sensors 18, parameter information from parameter module 50, and/or other information determined during a series of one or more exhalations of subject 12 (e.g., an average of one or more breathing parameters). In some embodiments, expiratory pressure module 58 may be configured to control pressure generator 14 to adjust the PEEP pressure level in proportion to the level of hyperinflation determined by expiratory pressure module 58 based on information determined from an algorithm. Expiratory pressure module 58 may determine the adjusted (e.g., increased and/or decreased) PEEP pressure level based on the algorithm. The algorithm may be determined at manufacture, determined by expiratory pressure module 58 based on information entered by subject 12 and/or other users (e.g., a doctor, a caregiver) via user interface 22, and/or determined by other methods. Expiratory pressure module 58 may be configured to determine algorithm inputs based on lung resistance and/or reactance information. Lung resistance and/or reactance information may comprise information that describes the resistance of the airway of subject 12 to airflow during inspiration and/or expiration. Expiratory pressure module 58 may be configured to determine lung resistance and/or reactance information responsive to control module 54 controlling pressure generator 14 according to the forced oscillation technique. Expiratory pressure module 58 may be configured to determine algorithm inputs based on outputs from sensors 18 and/or parameter module 50 while control module 54 controls pressure generator 14 according to the forced oscillation technique. In some embodiments, algorithm inputs may be determined by expiratory pressure module 58 based on information from sensors 18 and/or parameter module 50 related to an inspiratory flow, changes in a peak expiratory flow, changes in an expiratory volume, and/or other information. In some embodiments, the algorithm may utilize one or more statistical techniques (e.g., least mean squares). In some embodiments, the PEEP level may be increased and/or decreased by a predetermined amount of pressure. The predetermined amount of pressure may be determined at manufacture, set by subject 12 and/or other users (e.g., a doctor, a caregiver) via user interface 22, determined by expiratory pressure module 58 specifically for subject 12 based on previous respiration of subject 12 and/or other respiratory characteristics of subject 12 (e.g., a lung capacity of subject 12), and/or determined by other methods. User interface 22 is configured to provide an interface between system 10 and subject 12, and/or other users through which subject 12 and/or other users may provide information to and receive information from system 10. Other users may comprise, for example, a caregiver, a doctor, and/or other users. This enables data, cues, results, and/or instructions and any other communicable items, collectively referred to as “information,” to be communicated between a user (e.g., subject 12) and one or more of pressure generator 14, processor 20, and/or other components of system 10. For example, therapy pressures, the breath rate of subject 12, the portable power system energy level, and/or other information may be displayed to a user (e.g., subject 12) via user interface 22. Examples of interface devices suitable for inclusion in user interface 22 comprise a keypad, buttons, switches, a keyboard, knobs, levers, a display screen, a touch screen, speakers, a microphone, an indicator light, an audible alarm, a printer, a tactile feedback device, and/or other interface devices. In some embodiments, user interface 22 comprises a plurality of separate interfaces. In some embodiments, user interface 22 comprises at least one interface that is provided integrally with housing 28. It is to be understood that other communication techniques, either hard-wired or wireless, are also contemplated by the present disclosure as user interface 22. For example, the present disclosure contemplates that user interface 22 may be integrated with a removable storage interface provided by electronic storage 24. In this example, information may be loaded into system 10 from removable storage (e.g., a smart card, a flash drive, a removable disk, etc.) that enables the user(s) to customize the implementation of system 10. Other exemplary input devices and techniques adapted for use with system 10 as user interface 22 comprise, but are not limited to, an RS-232 port, RF link, an IR link, modem (telephone, cable or other). In short, any technique for communicating information with system 10 is contemplated by the present disclosure as user interface 22. In some embodiments, electronic storage 24 comprises electronic storage media that electronically stores information. The electronic storage media of electronic storage 24 may comprise one or both of system storage that is provided integrally (i.e., substantially non-removable) with system 10 and/or removable storage that is removably connectable to system 10 via, for example, a port (e.g., a USB port, a firewire port, etc.) or a drive (e.g., a disk drive, etc.). Electronic storage 24 may comprise one or more of optically readable storage media (e.g., optical disks, etc.), magnetically readable storage media (e.g., magnetic tape, magnetic hard drive, floppy drive, etc.), electrical charge-based storage media (e.g., EEPROM, RAM, etc.), solid-state storage media (e.g., flash drive, etc.), and/or other electronically readable storage media. Electronic storage 24 may store software algorithms, information determined by processor 20, information received via user interface 22, and/or other information that enables system 10 to function properly. Electronic storage 24 may be (in whole or in part) a separate component within system 10, or electronic storage 24 may be provided (in whole or in part) integrally with one or more other components of system 10 (e.g., user interface 22, processor 20, etc.). Information determined by processor 20 and/or stored by electronic storage 24 may comprise information related to an expiratory pressure level, respiration of subject 12, use frequency, and/or other information. The information stored by electronic storage 24 may be viewed via user interface 22, by connecting (wired and/or wireless) to a separate computer, and/or other via other methods. The information stored by electronic storage 24 may be used, for example, to adjust settings, to make adjustments to power system 26, used by a doctor to make medical decisions, and/or for other uses. In some embodiments, system 10 may include a wireless transmitter (not shown) and the information determined by processor 20, the information stored by electronic storage 24, and/or other information may be communicated to a care giver, for example, over a wireless network. By way of a non-limiting example, the care giver may receive use information, patient status, and/or other information, allowing the care giver to remotely track the therapy delivered by system 10. Portable power system 26 is configured to power pressure generator 14, one or more sensors 18, one or more processors 20, user interface 22, electronic storage 24, and/or other components of system 10 in a portable manner. Power system 26 may comprise one or more power sources. The one or more power sources may be connected in series and/or in parallel. In some embodiments, the one or more power sources may not be connected. The one or more power sources may be configured to power one or more of the other components of system 10. In some embodiments, power system 26 is rechargeable. Power system 26 may be recharged via a home AC power source, a car battery outlet, an airplane power outlet, a USB port, a non-contact charging circuit, and/or other recharging methods.
