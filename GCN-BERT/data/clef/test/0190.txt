Preparation Example 1-3 : Preparation of (4-chloro-3-fluoro-pyridin-2-yl)-carbamic acid-tert-butyl ester
4-Chloro-3-fluoro-pyridin-2-carboxylic acid (13.06 g, 0.074 mol) was dissolved in tert-butanol (370 ml) and the temperature was lowered to 0 °C. To the resulting solution was added dropwise triethylamine (15.56 ml, 0.112 mol). And then, the solution was stirred at room temperature for 40 min and the reaction temperature was lowered to 0 °C. Diphenylphosphorylazide (DPPA) (24.09 ml, 0.112 mol) was added dropwise to the solution and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hrs and then with reflux for 18 hrs. After completion of the reaction, the solution was extracted with ethylacetate, washed with distilled water, and then dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane/ethylacetate = 2/1) to give the brown title compound (5.51 g, 30.0 %).
