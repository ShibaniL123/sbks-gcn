TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to chimeric genes for the catalytic protein of Oplophorus luciferase, use thereof and so on. BACKGROUND ART Bioluminescence is a phenomenon based on a chemical reaction in vivo, which is called a luciferin (a luminescence substrate)-luciferase (an enzyme that catalyzes the luminescence reaction) reaction. Numerous studies of the identification of luciferins or luciferases and the elucidation of the luminescence mechanism in a molecular level have been performed for a long time in the country and overseas. In bioluminescent marine organisms, Oplophorus gracilirostris luciferase from the deep-sea shrimp is an extracellularly secreted luciferase (Non-Patent Document 1). Oplophorus luciferase is a 106 kDa protein composed of a protein with a molecular weight of 35 kDa and a protein with a molecular weight of 19 kDa. The domain that catalyzes the luminescence is found to be 19 kDa protein. Oplophorus luciferase uses coelenterazine as a luminescence substrate and is classified as a coelenterazine-type luciferase (Patent Document 1, Non-Patent Document 2). Oplophorus luciferase is different from other coelenterazine-type luciferases in broad substrate specificity and uses coelenterazine analogues as a suitable substrate as well as coelenterazine (Non-Patent Document 2). When the gene for the 19 kDa protein is expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) at ambient and lower temperatures, the protein is expressed mostly as an insoluble protein (Non-Patent Document 3). When the 19 kDa protein is expressed as a fusion protein to ZZ domain from protein A in a low temperature expression system, the fused protein can be expressed as a soluble protein (Non-Patent Document 4). It is also reported that when the 19 kDa protein was expressed in animal culture cells, the expressed protein was hardly secreted outside of cells (Non-Patent Document 2). Recently, it is reported that the mutated 19 kDa protein having catalytic activity of luminescence was prepared by mutating the 16 amino acids of the 19 kDa protein and showed a higher luminescence activity than native 19 kDa protein, and was secreted into an extracellular medium (Patent Document 2, Non-Patent Documents 4 and 5). It is also reported that coelenterazine derivatives displayed higher activity than native coelenterazine used as a substrate (Non-Patent Documents 4 and 5). In the luminescence reaction system using coelenterazine as a substrate, the luminescence reaction of luciferase proceeds only by a substrate and molecular oxygen. For this reason, a coelenterazine-type luciferase gene is used widely as a reporter assay in an animal cultured cell system at present. Renilla luciferase having 311 amino acids is used for a reporter assay inside of cells. For an extracellular reporter assay, the secreted Gaussia luciferase which is a secretory luciferase having 168 amino acids is used. When recombinant Renilla luciferase and Gaussia luciferase are compared in specific activity using coelenterazine as a luminescence substrate, the specific activity of Renilla luciferase is about 1/100 of Gaussia luciferase (Non-Patent Documents 5 and 6). On the other hand, the specific activity of mutated 19 kDa protein having catalytic activity of luminescence is 1/10 as compared to Gaussia luciferase, indicating that the mutated 19 kDa protein is obviously inferior as the gene for a reporter assay as a secreted protein. In view of the foregoing, it has been desired to develop a reporter gene which is an intracellular and secreted luciferase and has a higher luminescence activity than that of native 19 kDa protein when coelenterazine or even its analogue is used as the substrate.

MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The present invention will be described below in detail. 1. Luciferase Mutant of the Invention The term luciferase mutant of the present invention refers to a mutant of the protein with a molecular weight of 19 kDa of Oplophorus luciferase. Specifically, the luciferase mutant of the present invention is intended to mean a luciferase mutant having substantially the same activity as the luciferase mutant comprising an amino acid sequence in which tyrosine at position of 138 is substituted with another amino acid and at least 3 amino acids selected from the group consisting of isoleucine at position of 90, proline at position of 115, glutamine at position of 124 and asparagine at position of 166 are substituted with other amino acids, in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. The term “substantially the same activity” is intended to mean at least one activity selected from luciferase activity, activity for little extracellular secretion when expressed in animal cells, and so on. The term “luciferase activity” is intended to mean the activity for catalyzing the luminescence reaction using a luciferin (e.g., a coelenterazine analogue) which is used as a substrate, namely, the reaction in which luciferin (e.g., a coelenterazine analogue) is oxidized with molecular oxygen to produce oxyluciferin in its excited state. The excited state of oxyluciferin produced emits visible light and converts to the ground state of oxyluciferin. Luminescence activity can be determined by the method described in, e.g., Inouye, S. & Shimomura, O. (1977) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 233, 349-353. Specifically, the luciferase mutant of the present invention is mixed with a luciferin to start the luminescence reaction, and the activity of catalyzing luminescence reaction can be determined using a luminometer. Commercially available luminometers, e.g., Luminescencer-PSN AB2200 (manufactured by Atto Inc.) or Centro 960 luminometer (manufactured by Berthold Inc.) may be used as luminometers. The luciferin used in the present invention may be any luciferin as far as it is used as a substrate for the luciferase mutants of the present invention. Specifically, the luciferin used in the present invention includes a coelenterazine analogue containing the imidazopyrazinone ring as the backbone. The coelenterazine analogue is used to mean coelenterazine or its analogues. Coelenterazine analogues include, for example, bis-coelenterazine, deoxyfuran-coelenterazine (furimazine), h-coelenterazine, hcp-coelenterazine, cp-coelenterazine, f-coelenterazine, fcp-coelenterazine, n-coelenterazine, MeO-coelenterazine, e-coelenterazine, cl-coelenterazine, ch-coelenterazine, 3iso-coelenterazine, 3meo-coelenterazine, cf3-coelenterazine, i-coelenterazine, et-coelenterazine, me-coelenterazine, 3me-coelenterazine, ameh-coelenterazine 8-(1-naphthyl)-coelenterazine, 8-(2-naphthyl)-coelenterazine, 8-(2-thienyl)-coelenterazine, 6,8-di(2-thienyl)-coelenterazine, 8-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-coelenterazine, 8-(2-benzothienyl)-coelenterazine, 8-(b-styryl)-coelenterazine, 8-phenyl-coelenterazine, 6-deoxy-coelenterazine, 8-(3-thienyl)-coelenterazine and 8-(3-benzo[b]thienyl)-coelenterazine. Of these coelenterazines analogues, coelenterazine is particularly preferred in the present invention. These coelenterazine analogues could be synthesized by publicly known methods or may also be commercially available. The coelenterazine analogues could be synthesized by the methods described in, e.g., Shimomura et al. (1988) Biochem. J. 251, 405-410, Shimomura et al. (1989) Biochem. J. 261, 913-920, Shimomura et al. (1990) Biochem. J. 270, 309-312, Tetrahedron Lett. 38: 6405-6406, WO 2010/090319, Inouye et al. (2010) Anal. Biochem. 407, 247-252 or Inouye et al. (2013) Biocchem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 437, 23-28, or respective modifications thereof. Furimazine may be produced by the method described in Hall et al. (2012) ACS Chem. Biol. 16; 848-1857. The coelenterazines analogues which are commercially available include, for example, coelenterazine, cf3-coelenterazine and h-coelenterazine manufactured by JNC Corp.; hcp-coelenterazine, cp-coelenterazine, f-coelenterazine, fcp-coelenterazine and n-coelenterazine manufactured by Biotium Inc.; and bis-coelenterazine manufactured by Prolume Ltd. and coelenterazine, furimazine and h-coelenterazine manufactured by Promega Corp. The “luminescence activity using a luciferin as a substrate” refers to luminescence activity using preferably coelenterazine analogues as the substrate. Preferably, the “luminescence activity using coelenterazine analogues as a substrate” is the luminescence activity in which coelenterazine is used as the substrate. The “activity for little extracellular secretion when expressed in animal cells” is intended to mean that when the protein is expressed in animal cells, most of the expressed protein is not exported but is retained within the cell, and hardly secreted outside of the cell. The term “little extracellular secretion” is specifically intended to mean that extracellular secretion of the protein occurs in an amount (by weight) of 5% or less, 4% or less, 3% or less, 2% or less, 1% or less, 0.5% or less, 0.1% or less, 0.05% or less, or 0.01% or less, of the expressed protein. Specific examples of the “animal cells” are those later described.

Polynucleotide of the Invention The present invention also provides a polynucleotide comprising a polynucleotide encoding the luciferase mutant of the invention described above. The polynucleotide of the invention may be any polynucleotide so long as it has a nucleotide sequence encoding the luciferase mutant of the invention, although a DNA is preferred.

TABLE 1 Substituted amino acids and nucleotides in WNanoKAZ Nucleotide sequence Substitution Substitution Substituted position (before) (after) of amino acid (Wild type = KAZ) (WNanoKAZ) I90V 268 ATT (I) 268 GTC (V) P115E 343 CCT (P) 343 GAG (E) Q124K 370 CAG (Q) 370 AAG (K) Y138I 412 TAT (Y) 412 ATC (I) N166R 496 AAC (N) 496 AGA (R) Example 2 Expression of WNanoKAZ in E. coli and Preparation of Crude Enzyme Solution In order to express WNanoKAZ in E. coli, pCold-ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ obtained in EXAMPLE 1 was used. The E. coli BL21 strain (Novagen, Madison, Wis.) was used as a host cell. The BL21 strain carrying the recombinant plasmid was incubated in 5 mL of Luria-Bertani medium (hereinafter designated as LB medium) containing ampicillin (50 μg/mL) at 37° C. for 17 hours. The seed culture of 0.1 mL was inoculated to 10 mL of LB medium and incubated for 3 hours, followed by cooling in freezing water for 1 hour. IPTG was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 0.1 mM, followed by incubation at 15° C. for further 19 hours. After completion of the incubation, 1 mL of the culture medium was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 2 minutes. The collected E. coli cells were suspended in 0.5 mL of 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)-10 mM EDTA. The cells were disrupted by sonication for 3 seconds using a Branson Model 250 Sonifire (Danbury, Conn.) to give a crude enzyme solution. Then, DTT was added to the crude enzyme solution at a final concentration of 1 mM. After the mixture was allowed to stand in freezing water over 8 hours or more, the luminescence activity was measured. Example 3 Assay for Luminescence Activity of WNanoKAZ in Crude Enzyme Solution 1 μl of the crude enzyme solution obtained in EXAMPLE 2 was added to 100 μl of 30 mM Trix-HCl (pH 7.6)-10 mM EDTA (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) containing 1 μg of coelenterazine (manufactured by JINC Corp.), luminescence reaction was started. Luminescence activity was measured for 60 seconds using a luminometer (manufactured by Atto Inc.: AB2200); the maximum intensity of luminescence (Imax) was given as a relative luminescence activity. As a result, WNanoKAZ displayed 64-fold higher activity than native KAZ, and dnKAZ (amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 18; in nanoKAZ the KLGTTMV peptide is added to the N terminus of dnKAZ), which is the mutated KAZ with 16 mutations, displayed 7.4-fold higher activity than that of native KAZ, as shown in TABLE 2. The luminescence activity was enhanced by introducing amino acid substitutions at 5 positions. TABLE 2 Luminescence activity of WNanoKAZ, KAZ and dnKAZ in crude enzyme solution Expression vector (pCold-ZZ-P-) Relative luminescence activity (Imax) KAZ 1.0 WNanoKAZ 64 dnKAZ 7.4 Example 4 Secretory Expression Vector for WNanoKAZ Using the Secretory Signal Peptide Sequence of Gaussia Luciferase The expression vector for WNanoKAZ was constructed as follows. Firstly, a novel vector pcDNA3-GLsp for expression in animal cultured cells was constructed. Specifically, the secretory signal peptide sequence of Gaussia luciferase was obtained from pcDNA3-GLuc vector (manufactured by Prolume Ltd.) by PCR using the GLsp-1R/EcoRI primer (SEQ ID NO: 21: 5′ ggc GAA TTC GGT GGG CTT GGC CTC GGC CAC 3′, EcoRI sequence underlined) and T7 primer (SEQ ID NO: 22: 5′ TAATACG ACTCACTATAGGG 3′) by PCR. After digesting with HindIII/EcoRI, the resultant fragment was inserted into the HindIII/EcoRI site of pcDNA3 vector (manufactured by Invitrogen Inc.) to construct a novel expression vector pcDNA3-GLsp. That is, the novel expression vector is under the control of the CMV promoter, followed by the Kozak sequence, the secretory signal peptide sequence of Gaussia luciferase and a multiple-cloning site sequence. Next, the expression vector for WNanoKAZ was constructed as follows, using the novel expression vector pcDNA3-GLsp. The DNA fragment obtained in EXAMPLE 1 was digested with the restriction enzymes of EcoRI/XbaI in a conventional manner and then ligated to the EcoRI-XbaI site of pcDNA3-GLsp to construct the expression vector pcDNA3-GLsp-WNanoKAZ. The gene sequence inserted was confirmed by sequencing using a DNA Sequencer (manufactured by ABI Inc.). As a result, it was confirmed that the insert gene sequence was the nucleotide sequence shown by SEQ ID NO: 5 (WNanoKAZ), and the amino acid sequence encoded by the gene sequence was the amino acid sequence shown by SEQ ID NO: 6 (WNanoKAZ). Example 5 Transfection of Vectors into Animal Culture Cells and Preparation of Enzyme for Assay (1) Purification of Expression Plasmid The following experiment was performed using pcDNA3-GLsp-WNanoKAZ obtained in EXAMPLE 4. The recombinant plasmid was purified from E. coli JM83 strain using a plasmid purification kit (manufactured by QIAGEN) and dissolved in sterile water. The firefly luciferase vector (pGL4.13 [Luc2/sv40]: manufactured by Promega Corp.) was similarly prepared and used as an internal standard. (2) Transfection and Preparation of Enzyme for Assay Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO-K1 was cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (manufactured by Biowest Inc.). The CHO-K1 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate in 1×105 cells/well/2 mL medium (n=2) and cultured in an incubator at 37° C. in 5% (v/v) CO2. After 24 hours, the purified recombinant plasmid was transfected to CHO-K1 cells using a FuGene HD transfection kit (manufactured by Promega Corp.) and the cells were used for subsequent experiment. Specifically, 1 pg of the recombinant plasmid, 0.1 μg of the internal standard vector pGL4.13 [Luc2/sv40] and 3 μL of FuGene HD were added to 100 μL of the medium and allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Subsequently, 100 μL of the DNA-FuGene complex solution was added to the cells in the 6-well plate. After incubation for 46 hours, the culture medium was collected. On the other hand, the KAZ mutant expressed in the cells was washed 3 times with 3 mL of 1×PBS, then suspended in 1 mL of 1×PBS and disrupted by sonication on ice. The resultant cell extract of WNanoKAZ was used as the enzyme solution. Example 6 Assay for Luminescence Activity of KAZ Mutants Expressed in Animal Cultured Cells After adding 5 μL of the culture medium and cell extract obtained in EXAMPLE 5 to 100 μL of 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)-10 mM EDTA (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) containing 1 μg of coelenterazine (manufactured by JNC Corp.), a luminescence reaction was started. Luminescence activity was measured for 60 seconds using a luminometer (manufactured by Atto Inc.: AB2200). The maximum intensity of luminescence (Imax) was given as a percentage (%). The results reveal that extracellular secretion was not observed, as shown in TABLE 3. TABLE 3 Luminescence activity of WnanoKAZ, KAZ and dnKAZ expressed in animal culture cells Relative luminescence Expression vector activity (%, Imax) (pcDNA3-GLsp-) Culture medium Cell extracts KAZ 0.1 0.2 WNanoKAZ <0.01 22 dnKAZ 100 16 Regarding firefly luciferase used as an internal standard to confirm the efficiency of transfection, 5 μL of the cell extract obtained in EXAMPLE 5 was added to 100 μL of a reagent for enzyme assay (Promega Corp.) to start a luminescence reaction. Luminescence activity was measured for 10 seconds in terms of the maximum intensity of luminescence (flu), using a luminometer (manufactured by Atto Inc.: AB2200). The results reveal that the transfection efficiencies were almost the same. Example 7 Construction of Single Amino Acid-Substituted Mutant Gene for WNanoKAZ WNanoKAZ displayed 64-fold higher activity than that of dnKAZ as shown in EXAMPLE 3, when coelenterazine was used as the substrate. The higher activity is considered to be due to amino acid substitutions at 5 positions, in contrast to native KAZ. In order to identify amino acid residues associated with the increased activity, a mutant in which the substituted amino acid residues at 5 positions were replaced with the amino acid residues from native KAZ was constructed to examine its effects on luminescence activity. Amino acid substitution to the WNanoKAZ gene by site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR by the procedure described in Ho et al., Gene (1989) 77: 51-59. Specifically, PCR (cycle conditions: 25 cycles of 1 min/94° C., 1 min/50° C. and 1 min/72° C.) was performed with a PCR kit (manufactured by Takara Bio Inc.) using as a temperate pCold-KAZ or pCold-ZZ-KAZ carrying the WNanoKAZ gene and two PCR primers. To construct, e.g., single amino acid-substituted mutant gene WNanoKAZ-E115P, were prepared DNA fragments amplified by the following primers using as the template pcDNA3-GLsp-WNanoKAZ obtained in EXAMPLE 4. Primers Used to Prepare DNA Fragments: KAZ-8N/EcoRI (SEQ ID NO: 19) (5′ gcg GAA TTC TTT ACG TTG GCA GAT TTC GTT GGA 3′) nanoKAZ: E115P-R (SEQ ID NO: 23) (5′ GAC GGC GAT GCC AGG GTA GGG TCT ACC 3′) nanoKAZ: E115P-F (SEQ ID NO: 24) (5′ GGT AGA CCC TAC CCT GGC ATC GCC GTC 3′) nanoKAZ-3C/XbaI (SEQ ID NO: 25) (5′ gcc TCT AGA TTA GGC CAG GAT TCT CTC GCA CAG TCT 3′) The second PCR was carried out using the DNA fragments obtained above at the two sites and PCR primers of KAZ-8N/EcoRI and nanoKAZ-3C/XbaI (SEQ ID NO: 25). As a result, the WNanoKAZ gene region (WNanoKAZ-E115P) with substitution of proline for glutamic acid at amino acid position 115 in the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 was amplified. Amino acid-substituted WNanoKAZ gene regions were obtained in a similar manner using the templates and primers listed in TABLE 4.

Specifically, pCold-ZZ-X (described in Inouye & Sahara, Protein Express. Purif. (2009) 66: 52-57) was used. The DNA fragment obtained in EXAMPLE 7 was digested with the restriction enzymes of EcoRI and XbaI and ligated to the EcoRI-XbaI site of the expression vector to construct the following 5 expression vectors capable of expressing the ZZ domain-fused single amino acid-substituted WNanoKAZ mutants: pCold-ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-V90I, pCold-ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-E115P, pCold-ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-K124Q, pCold-ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-I138Y and pCold-ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-R166N. The nucleotide sequence of the inserted DNA was confirmed by sequencing using a DNA Sequencer (manufactured by ABI Inc.). The substituted amino acids and nucleotides in the amino acid sequence of WNanoKAZ mutant are shown in TABLE 5 TABLE 5 Substituted amino acids and nucleotides in WNanoKAZ mutants Nucleotide sequence WNanoKAZ mutant Substitution Substitution (WNanoKAZ-) (before) (after) V90I 268 GTC(V) 268 ATT(I) E115P 343 GAG(E) 343 CCT(P) K124Q 370 AAG(K) 370 CAG(Q) I138Y 412 ATC(I) 412 TAT(Y) R166N 496 AGA(R) 496 AAC(N) Example 9 Expression of ZZ-Fused KAZ Mutants in E. coli and Preparation of Crude Enzyme Solution In order to express ZZ-fused KAZ mutants in E. coli, the recombinant plasmid produced in EXAMPLE 8 and pCold-ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ produced in EXAMPLE 1 were used. The crude enzyme solution was prepared in a manner similar to EXAMPLE 2, using the E. coli BL21 strain (Novagen, Madison, Wis.) as a host cell. Then, 5 μL of the crude enzyme solution obtained was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis to confirm the protein expression in all mutants. The results are shown in FIG. 1. In FIG. 1, M and 1 to 8 represent as follows. M: molecular weight size markers; 1: ZZ-P-KAZ; 2: ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ; 3: ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-V90I; 4: ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-E115P; 5: ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-K124Q; 6: ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-I138Y; 7: ZZ-P-WNanoKAZ-R166N; 8: ZZ-P-dnKAZ. It was confirmed from FIG. 1 that all mutants were expressed. Example 10 Assay for Luminescence Activity of ZZ-Fused WNanoKAZ Mutants in Crude Enzyme Solution DTT was added to the crude enzyme solution obtained in EXAMPLE 9 at a final concentration of 1 mM, and then allowed to stand in an ice-water bath over 8 hours or more. After 1 μL of the crude enzyme solution was added to 100 μL of 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)-10 mM EDTA (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) containing 1 μg of coelenterazine (manufactured by JNC Corp.), a luminescence reaction was started. Luminescence activity was measured for 60 seconds using a luminometer (manufactured by Atto Inc.: AB2200). The maximum intensity of luminescence (Imax) was given as a relative luminescence activity (rlu). The results reveal that WNanoKAZ, WNanoKAZ-I90V, WNanoKAZ-E115P, WNanoKAZ-K124Q, WNanoKAZ-I138Y and WNanoKAZ-R166N showed 64-fold, 34-fold, 31-fold, 34-fold, 8.5-fold and 32-fold higher activity, respectively, than native KAZ. Also, WNanoKAZ, WNanoKAZ-I90V, WNanoKAZ-E115P, WNanoKAZ-K124Q, WNanoKAZ-I138Y and WNanoKAZ-R166N showed 8.6-fold, 4.6-fold, 4.2-fold, 4.6-fold, 1.1-fold and 4.3-fold higher activity, respectively, than the relative activity 7.4 of dnKAZ. The activity of WNanoKAZ-I138Y decreased to the same level as that of dnKAZ, clearly showing that the substitution of isoleucine for tyrosine at amino acid position 138 was critical for enhancing the activity of KAZ. These results revealed that the substitution of Y138I in the 5 amino acid substitutions was critical and the higher activity could be achieved by at least 3 substitutions out of the remaining 4 substitutions, and preferably 4 substitutions, as shown in TABLE 6.

Specifically, bis-coelenterazine was synthesized by the method described in Nakamura et al. (1997) Tetrahedron Lett. 38: 6405-6406, furimazine by the method described in Hall et al. (2012) ACS Chem. Biol. 16; 848-1857, and, 6h-coelenterazine, f-coelenterazine and 6h-f-coelenterazine by the method described in Inouye et al (2013) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 437: 23-28. Luminescence activity was measured by the same method as in EXAMPLE 10, using the crude enzyme solution obtained in EXAMPLE 10, in which coelenterazine or its analogue was used as the luminescence substrate. As a result, WNanoKAZ and its single amino acid-substituted mutants exhibited enhanced luminescence activity, namely, WNanoKAZ, WNanoKAZ-190V, WNanoKAZ-E115P, WNanoKAZ-K124Q, WNanoKAZ-I138Y and WNanoKAZ-R166N exhibited 8.6-fold, 4.6-fold, 4.2-fold, 4.6-fold, 1.1-fold and 4.3-fold higher activity, respectively, than the other coelenterazine analogues when coelenterazine was used as the substrate, as shown in TABLE 7. It is noted from TABLE 7 that even when h-coelenterazine was used as the substrate, WNanoKAZ and its single amino acid-substituted mutants showed the activity as high as in the case when coelenterazine was used as the substrate.

The WNanoKAZ mutant gene fragment prepared in EXAMPLE 7 using the pcDNA3-GLsp-vector obtained in EXAMPLE 4 was digested with the restriction enzymes of EcoRI/XbaI in a conventional manner and ligated to the EcoRI-XbaI site of pcDNA3-GLsp to construct the following expression vectors: pcDNA3-GLsp-WNanoKAZ-V90I, pcDNA3-GLsp-WNanoKAZ-E115P, pcDNA3-GLsp-WNanoKAZ-K124Q, pcDNA3-GLsp-WNanoKAZ-I138Y and pcDNA3-GLsp-WNanoKAZ-R166N. The gene sequence inserted was confirmed by sequencing using a DNA Sequencer (manufactured by ABI Inc.). Example 13 Transfection of Vectors into Animal Culture Cells and Preparation of Enzyme for Assay (1) Purification of Expression Plasmid The recombinant plasmid obtained in EXAMPLE 12 or 4 was purified in a manner similar to EXAMPLE 5 and dissolved in sterile water. The firefly luciferase vector (pGL4.13 [Luc2/sv40]: manufactured by Promega Corp.) was similarly prepared and used as an internal standard. (2) Transfection and Preparation of Enzyme for Assay Culture medium containing two amino acid-substituted KAZ mutants and three amino acid-substituted KAZ mutants and cell extracts of the KAZ mutants as the enzyme solutions were prepared by the same procedure as in EXAMPLE 9. The resultant culture medium and cell extracts were used to measure luminescence activity as in EXAMPLE 6. As shown in TABLE 8, it was not recognized that WNanoKAZ and WNanoKAZ mutants happened to secret from the cells, as opposed to dnKAZ, while the mutants were expressed in the cytoplasm.

The results reveal that the substitution of isoleucine at position of 138 was critical for the enhanced activity and, in the remaining 4 substitutions, at least 3 substitutions, preferably 4 substitutions are associated with the enhanced activity. In addition, these chimeric proteins have the property that into aminal culture cells and advantageously used for reporter assay in the cytoplasm, and the like. It had been observed by preliminary experiments for the present invention that a mutant with substitution of valine, not with isoleucine, for tyrosine at amino acid position 138 gave the same results as with the isoleucine substitution in the same experiments as demonstrated in EXAMPLES above. The results from a series of experiments of the present invention reveal that not only the substitution of isoleucine but also the substitution of valine for tyrosine at position of 138 can provide the mutants of the invention with the enhanced luminescence activity.
