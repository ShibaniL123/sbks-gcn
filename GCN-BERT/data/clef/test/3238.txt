BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a liquid cosmetic container for applying a liquid cosmetic. 2. Description of the Conventional Art Conventionally, as a liquid cosmetic container with an application body which accommodates a liquid cosmetic such as a mascara, a lip gloss or the like and can apply the liquid cosmetic, a bottle type has been generally known. In the case of this bottle type liquid cosmetic container, there is a problem that a lot of liquid cosmetic which can not be used up by the attached application body is still left within the container. Accordingly, the following Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2006-102478 and Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 9-103322 disclose a liquid cosmetic container with an application body of such a type that a liquid cosmetic is accommodated in an inner portion of a bag-like container, in order to overcome the problem of the bottle type mentioned above. The liquid cosmetic container is structured such as to have a bag-like container which has an opening neck portion communicating an inner side and an outer side of a bag portion as well as accommodating a liquid cosmetic within the bag portion, a lid portion which is detachably installed to the opening neck portion so as to form a lid of the opening neck portion, and an application body which is provided in the lid portion and goes into the bag portion through the opening neck portion at a time when the lid portion is installed to the opening neck portion so as to dip into the liquid cosmetic, and is structured such that a user detaches the lid portion from the opening neck portion and applies the liquid cosmetic attached to the application body to a portion to be applied, at a time of using. Further, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2006-102478, the bag-like container is made of a synthetic resin, for example, a polyethylene, a polypropylene or the like, and it is described as it is possible to run short of a good part of the liquid cosmetic by pushing and squeezing the bag-like container. Further, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 9-103322, a bag-like container constructed by a film having an elasticity and a flexibility is accommodated in a hard container main body, and it is described as it is possible to collect a liquid cosmetic in an application body going into a bag portion on the basis of a self restoring force of the bag-like container to an original sheet shape going with a use, and it is possible to run short of a good part of the liquid cosmetic. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Problem to be Solved by the Invention However, in the Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2006-102478, since the bag-like container is made soft for pushing and squeezing in order to run short of a good part of the liquid cosmetic, there is a problem that the application body going into the bag portion is deformed or broken if such a pressing force as to erroneously crush the bag-like container is applied from an external portion, whereby an applying function is deteriorated. Further, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 9-103322, since the bag-like container is accommodated in the hard container main body, it is possible to prevent the application body going into the bag body from being deformed or broken even if the pressing force is applied from the external portion, however, it is impossible to laconically and sufficiently run short of the liquid cosmetic within the bag portion only by the self restoring force of the bag-like container. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a liquid cosmetic container which can sufficiently run short of a liquid cosmetic, can sufficiently reduce a remaining amount and sufficiently protect an application body. Means for Solving the Problem According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a liquid cosmetic container comprising: a bag-like container which is provided with a bag portion formed by aligning at least two films so as to join ends of the films to each other, and has an opening neck portion communicating an inner side and an outer side of the bag portion as well as accommodating a liquid cosmetic within the bag portion; a lid portion which is detachably installed to the opening neck portion so as to form a lid of the opening neck portion; and an application body which is provided in the lid portion and goes into the bag portion through the opening neck portion at a time when the lid portion is installed to the opening neck portion, wherein the liquid cosmetic container comprises a pipe portion which is continuously provided in the opening neck portion so as to extend in such a manner as to head for a bottom portion side within the bag portion, is formed as a tubular shape capable of accommodating the application body, and is provided in its peripheral surface with an opening enabling the liquid cosmetic to go into an internal portion, and wherein the application body goes into the pipe portion so as to reach a position at which the opening of the pipe portion is provided, at a time when the lid portion is installed to the opening neck portion. In accordance with the liquid cosmetic container mentioned above, since the liquid cosmetic is accommodated within the bag portion in the bag-like container, the bag-like container is provided with the pipe portion which is continuously provided in the opening neck portion so as to extend in such a manner as to head for the bottom portion side within the bag portion as well as being provided with the opening neck portion communicating the inner side and the outer side of the bag portion, the opening enabling the liquid cosmetic to go into the inner portion is provided in the peripheral surface of the pipe portion, and the application body provided in the lid portion goes into the pipe portion through the opening neck portion so as to be accommodated and reaches the position at which the opening of the pipe portion is provided, if the lid portion is installed to the opening neck portion, the liquid cosmetic goes into the pipe portion through the opening if the user pushes (squeezes) the bag portion, and the application body reaching the opening sufficiently dips into the liquid cosmetic. Accordingly, it is possible to sufficiently run short of the liquid cosmetic, and it is possible to sufficiently reduce the remaining amount. Further, since the application body is accommodated within the pipe portion as mentioned above, it is possible to sufficiently protect the application body by the pipe portion in the case that the pressing force of crushing the bag body is erroneously applied. In this case, if the opening of the pipe portion is a slit extending in an axial direction of the pipe portion, it is possible to easily introduce the liquid cosmetic into the pipe portion through this slit, and it is possible to further run short of the liquid cosmetic so as to further reduce the remaining amount. Further, if the slit is structured such as to be exposed at a whole length of the application body, the application body further sufficiently dips into the liquid cosmetic from the slit, and it is possible to further run short of the liquid cosmetic so as to further reduce the remaining amount. Further, if the opening of the pipe portion is open to a position which is opposed to a joint portion joining the film ends to each other, it is possible to further protect the application body by a peripheral wall of the pipe portion since no opening is provided in a direction in which the pressing force crushing the bag portion is applied (a back and front direction of the bag-like container). Further, if the joint portion joining the film ends to each other protrudes toward the opening, in a portion which is opposed to the opening of the pipe portion, the protruding joint portion and the opening form therebetween a flow path which is narrowed in comparison with the other portion. Therefore, if the user pushes the bag portion, the liquid cosmetic within the bag portion easily goes into the pipe portion while circulating in the vicinity of the opening, whereby it is possible to further run short of the liquid cosmetic so as to further reduce the remaining amount. Effect of the Invention As mentioned above, in accordance with the present invention, it is possible to sufficiently run short of the liquid cosmetic to reduce the remaining amount, and further sufficiently protect the application body.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT A description will be given below of a preferable embodiment of a cosmetic container in accordance with the present invention with reference to FIGS. 1 to 8. FIGS. 1 to 6 show a first embodiment in accordance with the present invention, FIG. 7 shows a second embodiment in accordance with the present invention, and FIG. 8 shows a third embodiment in accordance with the present invention, respectively. In each of the drawings, the same reference numerals are attached to the same elements, and an overlapping description will be omitted. First of all, a description will be given of the first embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 to 6. FIGS. 1 to 3 are respective perspective views showing the liquid cosmetic container in accordance with the first embodiment, FIG. 4 is a cross sectional view in the IV-IV in FIG. 1, FIG. 5 is a perspective view of a bag-like container, and FIG. 6 is a perspective view showing a lid portion with an application body. In this case, as a particularly preferable example, a description is given by setting a liquid cosmetic L to a mascara, and an application body 3 to a screw brush, however, the liquid cosmetic L may be set to a lip gloss and the application body 3 may be set to a flocky tip, or the application body 3 may be set to a comb, and it is of course possible to employ a liquid cosmetic container using the other liquid cosmetic and application body. As shown in FIGS. 1 to 3, a liquid cosmetic container 100 is provided with a bag-like container 1 which accommodates the liquid cosmetic L, and a lid portion 2 with the application body 3 which is detachably installed to the bag-like container 1. As shown in FIGS. 1 to 5, the bag-like container 1 has two films 1a and 1a which are formed as an approximately rectangular shape in a plan view, and a joint portion 1b which joins peripheral ends of the films 1a and 1a to each other, has a bag portion 1c in an inner side of the joint portion 1b, and further has an opening neck portion 1d which communicates an inner side and an outer side of the bag portion 1c. The joint portion 1b is formed by aligning the films 1a and 1a with each other and bonding the ends of the films 1a and 1a to each other at a predetermined width, for example, in accordance with a thermal welding. Various materials can be used as the film 1a. As examples, it is possible to employ an olefin polyethylene, a polypropylene, a polyester PET and the like, and those materials obtained by depositing an aluminum, an alumina, a silica or the like thereto, and further, those materials obtained by laminating an aluminum film. The bag portion 1c is formed in the inner side of the joint portion 1b by bonding the peripheral ends of the films 1a and 1a to each other, and accommodates the liquid cosmetic L in the inner portion thereof. The liquid cosmetic L is sealed by the lid portion 2 being installed to the bag-like container 1 as well as by the joint portion 1b. In this case, two films 1a and 1a are aligned and bonded, further, three or more films may be done so. The opening neck portion 1d is provided with an attaching portion 1e which is attached to the joint portion 1b, and an installation portion 1f for detachably installing the lid portion 2 with the application body. The attaching portion 1e is provided in one end side of the joint portion in a longitudinal direction of the film 1a which is formed as the approximately rectangular shape in the plan view, among the joint portion 1b. This attaching portion 1e is structured such that both right and left side portions are firmly attached to the joint portion 1b, and a center portion is formed as a communication tube portion 1g (refer to FIG. 3) constructed as a cylindrical shape so as to communicate the inner side and the outer side of the bag portion 1c. The application body 3 can be inserted through the communication tube portion 1g. The installation portion 1f is formed as a cylindrical shape coming next the communication tube portion 1g so as to be continuously provided in the communication tube portion 1g in such a manner as to protrude to an outer side. A male screw 1h which is screwed with the lid portion 2 with the application body and makes the lid portion 2 with the application body detachable is formed in an outer peripheral surface of the installation portion 1f. Further, a cylindrical insertion portion 1i is provided in an inner peripheral surface of the installation portion 1f. The application body 3 can be inserted through the insertion portion 1i which has a scraping portion 1j (refer to FIG. 3) for scraping a surplus liquid cosmetic L attached to the application body 3 at a time when the application body 3 passes, in the inner peripheral surface of the insertion portion 1i. In this case, particularly in the present embodiment, there is provided a cylindrical pipe portion 4 which is continuously provided in the communication tube portion 1g of the opening neck portion 1d and goes into the bag portion 1c coming next the communication tube portion 1g. The pipe portion 4 can accommodate the application body 3, and extends somewhat to the bottom portion side from the middle in the longitudinal direction of the bag-like container 1. Further, the pipe portion 4 is provided with a slit 4a corresponding to an opening which can circulate the liquid cosmetic L by communicating an inner side and an outer side, in a peripheral surface thereof. The slit 4a extends in an axial direction of the pipe portion 4, and is open at a length of the application body from the vicinity of a leading end (a bottom portion) of the pipe portion 4 (refer to FIG. 3). Two slits 4a are provided here, and are open at a position which is opposed to the joint portion 1b (refer to FIG. 4). Further, the liquid cosmetic L goes into the pipe portion 4 through the slit 4a and the opening in the leading end (the bottom portion side), and the pipe portion 4 is filled with the liquid cosmetic L. In this case, the pipe portion 4 is formed integrally with the attaching portion 1e constructing the opening neck portion 1d and the installation portion 1f, however, the pipe portion 4, the attaching portion 1e and the installation portion 1f may be formed integrally with the insertion portion 1i and the scraping portion 1j, and a combination of the integral formation can be optionally set. Further, all the pipe portion 4, the attaching portion 1e, the installation portion 1f, the insertion portion 1i and the scraping portion 1j may be set to independent parts and may be firmly attached. As shown in FIGS. 1 to 3 and FIG. 6, the lid portion 2 with the application body is provided with the lid portion 2a which comes to the lid of the opening neck portion 1d, and the application body 3 which is provided in the lid portion 2a. The lid portion 2a is constructed as a closed-end tubular shape, and has a female thread 2h which engages with the male screw 1h on the outer peripheral surface of the opening neck portion 1d, in an inner peripheral surface in an opening end side thereof. Further, the lid portion 2a is detachably installed to the bag-like container 1 by engaging the female thread 2h thereof with the male screw 1h. Further, the lid portion 2a has a shaft portion 2b which protrudes out of the lid portion 2a to the bag-like container 1, inserts through the insertion portion 1i of the bag-like container 1 and goes into the pipe portion 4, and the application body 3 is attached to a leading end of the shaft portion 2b. Further, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, if the lid portion 2a is installed to the opening neck portion 1d in accordance with an engagement of the threads 2h and 1h (if the lid portion 2a is fastened), the shaft portion 2b and the application body 3 go into the pipe portion 4 through the insertion portion 1i and the communication tube portion 1g, and the application body 3 reaches at the position at which the slit 4a of the pipe portion 4 is provided, whereby a whole length of the application body 3 is exposed out of the slit 4a. In this case, in the liquid cosmetic container 100 mentioned above, a suspending hole 1k is provided in one side of an upper portion in the joint portion 1b of the bag-like container 1. In accordance with the liquid cosmetic container 100 structured as mentioned above, the liquid cosmetic L is filled in the pipe portion 4 at a time of purchasing (at an initial time), and the application body 3 sufficiently dips in the liquid cosmetic L and the liquid cosmetic L is sufficiently attached to the application body. At a time of using, the user releases the engagement of the female thread 2h of the lid portion 2a and the male screw 1h of the opening neck portion 1d so as to detach the lid portion 2a from the bag-like container 1, by turning the lid portion 2a. At this time, the application body 3 passes through the scraping portion 1j and the surplus liquid cosmetic L is scrapped off. The user sets before use in a state in which the liquid cosmetic L is appropriately attached to the application body 3, and installs to the bag-like container 1 while turning the lid portion 2a after the use. Further, if the liquid cosmetic L within the pipe portion 4 goes down in accordance with the use, the user pushes (squeezes) the bag portion 1c in a state in which the lid portion 2a is installed to the bag-like container 1. Specifically, a portion having no pipe portion 4 (around the pipe portion 4) of the bag portion 1c is pushed. Accordingly, the liquid cosmetic L goes into the pipe portion 4 through the slit 4a, and since the application body 3 reaches at the position at which the slit 4a of the pipe portion 4 is provided, at this time, the application body 3 reaching the slit 4a sufficiently dips into the liquid cosmetic L. Therefore, the user may detach the lid portion 2a from the bag-like container 1 thereafter in the same manner as mentioned above, and may apply the liquid cosmetic L which is sufficiently attached to the application body 3 to the portion to be applied. Further, it is possible to sufficiently run short of the cosmetic L so as to sufficiently reduce the remaining amount, by repeating such a motion that the user pushes the bag portion 1c, each time when the liquid cosmetic L within the pipe portion 4 goes down. Further, in accordance with the liquid cosmetic container 100 of the present embodiment, since the application body 3 is accommodated within the pipe portion 4 as mentioned above, it is possible to sufficiently protect the application body 3 by the pipe portion 4 even in the case that such a pressing force as to crush the bag portion 1c is erroneously applied. Further, in accordance with the liquid cosmetic container 100 of the present embodiment, the following effects can be obtained. In other words, since the opening of the pipe portion 4 is formed as the slit 4a which extends in the axial direction of the pipe portion 4, it is possible to easily introduce the liquid cosmetic L into the pipe portion 4 through this slit 4a, and it is possible to further run short of the liquid cosmetic L so as to further reduce the remaining amount. Further, since the slit 4a makes the whole length of the application body 3 expose, the application body 3 further sufficiently dips into the liquid cosmetic L from the slit 4a, and it is possible to further run short of the liquid cosmetic L so as to further reduce the remaining amount. Further, since the slit 4a of the pipe portion 4 is open to the position which is opposed to the joint portion 1b which bonds the ends of the films 1a and 1a to each other, no opening is provided in the direction in which the pressing force crushing the bag portion 1c is applied (the front and back direction of the bag-like container 1; the vertical direction in FIG. 4). Therefore, it is possible to further protect the application body 3 by the peripheral wall of the pipe portion 4. In this connection, in accordance with an experiment of the inventor of the present invention, the remaining amount of the liquid cosmetic L comes to 5% from 15%. FIG. 7 is a view showing a liquid cosmetic container in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention, and is a schematic plan view for explaining a shape of a joint portion. A point at which the liquid cosmetic container 200 in accordance with the second embodiment is different from the liquid cosmetic container 100 in accordance with the first embodiment exist in a point that the joint portion opposed to the slit 4a of the pipe portion 4 in the joint portion 1b bonding the ends of the films 1a and 1a (refer to the first embodiment with regard to the pipe portion 4 and the slit 4a) is formed as a protruding portion 1n in which an inner edge 1m thereof protrudes toward the slit 4a. The inner edge 1m of the protruding portion 1n is formed such a shape as to gently curve toward an inner side in a plan view. In accordance with the liquid cosmetic container 200 mentioned above, since there is formed such a flow path that the portion between the protruding portion 1n and the slit 4a is narrowed in comparison with the other portions (between the joint portion 1b and the pipe portion 4 in which the slit 4a is not opened), by the protruding portion 1n protruding toward the slit 4a, the liquid cosmetic L within the bag portion 1c circulates the vicinity of the slit 4a so as to easily go into the pipe portion 4 by the pressing operation of the bag portion 1c by the user. Therefore, it is possible to further run short of the liquid cosmetic L so as to further reduce the remaining amount. FIG. 8 is a view showing a liquid cosmetic container in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention, and is a schematic plan view for explaining a shape of a bag-like container and a joint portion. A point at which the liquid cosmetic container 300 in accordance with the third embodiment is different from the liquid cosmetic container 200 in accordance with the second embodiment exist in a point that the protruding portion is formed as a protruding portion 1q in which an outer edge 1p is also formed as a curved shape extending along the inner edge 1m. In accordance with the liquid cosmetic container 300 of the third embodiment mentioned above, it goes without saying that the same effect as the second embodiment can be obtained, since both side portions (the outer edge 1p) of the bag-like container are formed as the inward curved shape, a design characteristic is enhanced. The present invention is specifically described above on the basis of the embodiments, however, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments mentioned above. For example, in the embodiments mentioned above, the opening of the pipe portion 4 is set to the slit 4a as a particularly preferable example, however, it may be constructed by a mere hole. Further, for example, it can be applied to the liquid cosmetic container which is sealed by a gusset provided in a bottom portion.
