2,2-Difluoro-3-((6S,8R)-6-(3-fluoro-5-((1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)amino)pyridin-2-yl)-8-methyl-3,6,8,9-tetrahydro-7H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-7-yl)propan-1-ol
Tetrabutylammonium fluoride (1.0 M in THF, 0.65 mL, 0.65 mmol) was added to a solution of 6-((6S,8R)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-5-fluoro-N-(1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)pyridin-3-amine (320 mg, 0.43 mmol) in THF (2.66 mL) at room temperature and stirred for 64 hours. The reaction mixture was evaporated and then dissolved in DMSO and the crude product was purified by flash reverse phase (Puriflash, 220 g, C18, 30 column), using decreasingly polar mixtures of water (containing 1% NH3) and MeCN as eluents. Fractions containing the desired compound were evaporated to dryness to afford a crude product (143 mg). The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 20% MeOH in EtOAc. Product containing fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford 2,2-difluoro-3-((6S,8R)-6-(3-fluoro-5-((1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)amino)pyridin-2-yl)-8-methyl-3,6,8,9-tetrahydro-7H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-7-yl)propan-1-ol (118 mg, 54%) as a mixture of isomers. The material was repurified by preparative HPLC (Waters XSelect CSH C18 column, 5Î¼ silica, 30 mm diameter, 100 mm length), using decreasingly polar mixtures of water (containing 0.1% formic acid) and MeCN as eluents. Fractions containing the desired compound were combined and purified by ion exchange chromatography, using an SCX-2 column. The desired product was eluted from the column using 1M NH3/MeOH and product containing fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford 2,2-difluoro-3-((6S,8R)-6-(3-fluoro-5-((1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)amino)pyridin-2-yl)-8-methyl-3,6,8,9-tetrahydro-7H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-7-yl)propan-1-ol (62.1 mg, 29%) as a colourless solid.
