Step 2
3-((3-Isopropylisoxazol-5-yl)methyl)-1-methylpyrimido [4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione
1-Methylpyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione (20.0 mg, 0.112 mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (2 mL). (3-Isopropylisoxazol-5-yl)methyl methanesulfonate (27.0 mg, 0.123 mmol), potassium iodide (4.0 mg, 0.0225 mmol) and potassium carbonate (31.0 mg, 0.225 mmol) were added at 25°C. The reaction was heated to 120°C and stirred for 16 hours. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by preparative HPLC to give 3-((3-isopropylisoxazol-5-yl)methyl)-1-methylpyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,4-dione (5.0 mg) with a yield of 15%.
