TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to, for example, adenosine A2A receptor antagonists comprising a thiazole derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as the active ingredient, etc., as defined in the claims. BACKGROUND ART It is known that adenosine ranges broadly in a living body and exhibits various physiological actions on the central nervous system, the cardiac muscle, the kidney, the lung, the smooth muscle and the like via its receptor. Four subtypes of adenosine receptors, A1, A2A, A2B and A3 have heretofore been known. The respective subtypeselective receptor antagonists and agonists are expected to exhibit their pharmaceutical effects based on the physiological meanings of the subtype and on the biological distribution thereof. Among them, the A2A receptors are localized in the brain, especially in the corpus striatum thereof, and as one of its functions, the inhibition of neurotransmitter release is reported (European Journal of Pharmacology, Vol. 168, p. 285, 1989). Accordingly, antagonists to the adenosine A2A receptor may be expected as agents for preventing and/or treating diseases associated with adenosine A2A receptor, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, AIDS encephalopathy, Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's chorea, multiple system atrophy, cerebral ischemia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorder, ischemic cardiopathy, intermittent claudication, diabetes, anxiety disorders (e.g., panic attack and panic disorder, phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety physical symptoms or substance-caused), mood disorders (e.g., depression, dysthymic disorder, mood-circulatory disorder), restless legs syndrome (RLS), drug dependence (e.g., alcohol dependence), eating disorder, epilepsy, migraine and chronic musculoskeletal system pain.

Pharmacological activities of typical Compounds (I) are illustrated below referring to Test Examples. Test Example 1 Binding activity to adenosine receptor (adenosine A 2A receptor binding test) This test was carried out in a similar manner to a Bruns et al's method (Molecular Pharmacology, Vol. 29, p. 331, 1986). Corpus striatum of rats (SD rat, by Nippon SLC) was suspended in 50 mL of an ice-cooled 50 mmol/L tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-HCl) buffer (pH 7.7) using a polytron homogenizer (by Kinematica). The resulting homogenate was centrifuged (48,000 xg, 20 minutes), and the resulting precipitate was again suspended by adding the same amount of a 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer, followed by centrifugation under the same condition. The resulting final precipitate was suspended by adding a 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer [containing 10 mmol/L magnesium chloride, adenosine deaminase 0.02 units/mg tissue (by Sigma)] so that the tissue concentration was 5 mg (wet weight)/mL. To 100 µL of the above purified tissue suspension, were added 80 µL (final concentration 6.0 mmol/L) of tritium-labeled CGS-21680 {3H-2-[p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino]-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)-adenosine: 40 curies/mmol; by New England Nuclear [The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Vol. 251, p. 888, 1989]} and 20 µL of a test compound solution (10-7 mol/L; a solution of a test compound in DMSO was diluted with Tris-HCl buffer). The resulting mixture was allowed to stand at 25°C for 120 minutes, followed by rapid suction filtration through a glass fiber paper filter (GF/C; by Whatman). The filter was immediately washed three times with 200 µL of an ice-cooled 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer. The glass fiber paper filter was transferred,into a vial, Microscinti (by Perkin Elmer) was added thereto, and the radioactivity level was measured with Topcount (by Perkin Elmer). The inhibition rate of the test compound to the adenosine A2A receptor binding (3H-CGS21680 binding) was calculated according to the following formula. Inhibition rate%=1-Amount of binding in the presence of test compound-Amount of non-specific bindingAmount of total binding-Amount of non-specific bindingX100 Amount of total binding means the 3H-CGS21680 binding radioactivity content in the absence of the test compound. Amount of non-specific binding means the 3H-CGS21680 binding radioactivity content in the presence of 100 µmol/L cyclopentyladenosine (CPA; by Sigma). Amount of binding in the presence of test compound means the 3H-CGS21680 binding radioactivity content in the presence of 10-7 mol/L of the test compound. The results are shown in Table 9.

Therefore, it was suggested that pharmaceutical composition comprising Compound (I) as the active ingredient is effective for diseases associated with adenosine A2A receptor [for example, central nervous system disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, AIDS encephalopathy, Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's chorea, multiple system atrophy, cerebral ischemia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorder, intermittent claudication, diabetes, anxiety disorders (e.g., panic attack and panic disorder, phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety physical symptoms or substance-caused), mood disorders (e.g., depression, dysthymic disorder, mood-circulatory disorder), restless legs syndrome (RLS), drug dependence (e.g., alcohol dependence), eating disorder, epilepsy, migraine and chronic musculoskeletal system pain; ischemic cardiopathy such as myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction]. Test Example 2 Effect in Parkinson's Disease Model [1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) -treated common marmoset] Parkinson's disease is a disorder based on the degeneration and lack of dopaminergic neurons in the nigro-striatal pathway. In the primates, treatment with a dopamine neurotoxin, that is MPTP, causes selective degeneration and lack of the dopaminergic neurons in the nigro-striatal pathway and causes a symptom such as akinesia and muscular rigidity. The MPTP-treated primate is known as a Parkinson's disease model (Proceedings of the National Academy of Science USA, Vol. 80, p. 4546, 1983). Also, common marmoset belongs to Anthropoidea, and is known to have parkinsonism caused by MPTP like others of Anthropoidea (Neuroscience Letter, Vol. 57, p. 37, 1985). The experiment was carried out using four male and female common marmosets of 2 or 3 years old (body weight, 300 to 375 g, by Nippon Clea) per group. MPTP (by RBI) was dissolved in a physiological saline for injection (by Otsuka Pharmaceutical), and hypodermically administered to the common marmosets in a dose of 2.0 mg/kg, once a day for 5 days. Six weeks or more after the administration, animals showing chronic parkinsonian symptoms were used in the test. The test compound was used as a suspension in an aqueous solution containing 0.3 % Tween 80 and 10 % sucrose. One hour before the administration of the test compound, the animals to be tested were put into an observation cage (equipped with a spontaneous locomotor activity measuring apparatus) to adopt them to the environment. The motor disability of the animals before the administration of the test compound was scored, and this was compared with the motor disability score after orally administration of the test compound (Compound 1) in a dose of 10 mg/kg. As the parkinsonian symptoms, the motor disabilities were scored at intervals of 30 minutes for 8 hours, by observation through a one-way viewing window. The spontaneous locomotor activity was measured at intervals of 30 minutes for 12 hours by a computer-controlled automatic measuring apparatus. The parkinsonian symptoms were scored on the basis of the rating scale of each observation item as shown below, and the total of the points were used as the score of each individual. Table 10 shows the relationship between the observation items and the score. Table 10Observation ItemsScore01234AlertnessNormalReducedSleepyChecking MovementPresentReducedAbsentAttention BlinkingNormalAbnormalPostureNormalAbnormal; in Trunk, Tail or Limbs (each 1 point)Grossly AbnormalBalanceNormalImpairedUnstableFallsReactivityNormalReducedSlowAbsentVocalizationNormalReducedAbsentTotal0-17 points The results were judged by comparing the average scores of the parkinsonian symptoms in 4 animals per group between before and after administration of Compound 1 (significance test: Wilcoxon Rank Sum test). As a result, it was confirmed that Compound 1 is effective for remission of the parkinsonian symptoms in the above-described test, and indicates that Compounds (I) are effective for preventing and/or treating Parkinson's disease. Although Compounds (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be administered as such, it is generally preferred to offer them in the form of various pharmaceutical preparations. Such pharmaceutical preparations are to be used in animals and humans. The pharmaceutical preparations can comprise Compounds (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as the active ingredient alone or in combination with any other active ingredients for the therapy. These pharmaceutical preparations may be produced by any methods well known in the technical field of pharmaceutics by mixing the active ingredient with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. It is desirable to select a route of administration that is most effective for the therapy, examples thereof being oral administration or parenteral administration such as intravenous administration. Examples of the dosage form include tablets and injections. Preparations suitable for oral administration such as tablets can be produced using, for example, excipients (e.g., lactose and mannitol), disintegrators (e.g., starch), lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate), binders (e.g., hydroxypropyl cellulose), surfactants (e.g., fatty acid esters) and plasticizers (e.g., glycerin). Preparations suitable for parenteral administration preferably comprise a sterilized aqueous preparation containing an active compound which is isotonic to the recipient's blood. In the case of an injection, for example, a solution for injection is prepared using a carrier comprising a saline solution, a glucose solution, or a mixture of a saline solution and a glucose solution. The parenteral preparations may also comprise one or more auxiliary components selected from the excipients, disintegrators, lubricants, binders, surfactants and plasticizers described in the above description of oral preparations and diluents, antiseptics, flavors, etc. In the case of the above-described applications, in general, Compounds (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may be administered systemically or locally, and orally or parenterally. The dose and the administration frequency may vary, depending on the administration form, on the age and the body weight of the patient, and on the property and the seriousness of the symptom to be treated. In the case of oral administration, in general, it may be administered once to a few times a day in a dose of 0.01 to 1000 mg/adult, preferably 0.05 to 500 mg/adult. In the case of parenteral administration such as intravenous administration, in general, it may be administered once to a few times a day or continuously administered in a mode of intravenous administration for 1 to 24 hours a day, in a dose of 0.001 to 1000 mg/adult, preferably 0.01 to 300 mg/adult. However, the dose and the administration frequency may vary depending on various conditions mentioned above. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The invention is described in detail with reference to the following Examples, Reference Examples and Formulation Examples. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum (1H NMR) used in Examples is determined at 270 MHz or 300 MHz. Some compounds could not show an exchangeable proton in some conditions. The signal multiplicity expression is an ordinary one, for which "br" indicates an apparently broad signal.
