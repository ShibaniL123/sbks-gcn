Step 7: tert-butyl (2R,3S)-2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-3-ylcarbamate
Tert-butyl (1R,2S)-1-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-1-hydroxylpent-4-yn-2-ylcarbamate (6.11 g, 19.6 mmol) was dissolved in 60 mL DMF, and purged with nitrogen for 30 minutes. Tris(tris(3-fluorophenyl)phosphine) rhodium chloride catalyst (427 mg, 0.393 mmol) was added, purged with nitrogen/vacuumized three times, and stirred at 80 Â°C for 16 hours under nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling, 150 mL water and 150 mL saturated sodium bicarbonate solution were added, and extracted with toluene. The combined organic phase was washed several times with water, dried and concentrated, and then the residue was purified ny silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, 30:1-25:1) to give the product tert-butyl (2R,3S)-2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran-3-ylcarbamate (4.89g). Yield: 80%.
