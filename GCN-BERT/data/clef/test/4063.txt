Step 2: Preparation of 5-benzyloxy-2-(4-bromophenyl)-3-methyl-1H-indole
Into a 100-mL round-bottom flask, was placed a solution of 2-bromo-1-(4-bromophenyl) propan-1-one (2.9 g, 9.93 mmol, 1.00 equiv), 4-(benzyloxy) aniline (3.0 g, 15.06 mmol, 1.50 equiv) and triethylamine (3.0 mL) in N, N-dimethylformamide (30 mL) at room temperature. The resulting solution was stirred for 12 hours at 125° C. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of water. The resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL×2) and the organic layers were combined, washed with brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solids were filtered out. The resulting mixture was concentrated under vacuum. The residue was applied onto a silica gel column eluting with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (v:v=1:2). This resulted in 1.3 g (33%) of 5-benzyloxy-2-(4-bromophenyl)-3-methyl-1H-indole as yellow solid.
