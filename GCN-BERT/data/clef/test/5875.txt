Step 7 Synthesis of compound I-039
The compound 39i (257 mg, 0.344 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (3.0 mL). The solution was cooled to -30°C. Anisole (0.225 mL, 2.06 mmol) and a 2 mol/L solution of aluminum chloride in nitromethane (1.03 mL, 2.06 mmol) were added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at -30°C for 30 minutes. Purified water and diisopropyl ether were added to the reaction mixture. Acetonitrile was added to the reaction mixture. After dissolution of the precipitates, the aqueous layer was separated. The organic layer was subjected to extraction with purified water. HP20SS was added to combined aqueous layers. The mixture was concentrated. The concentrated suspension was subjected to column chromatography with HP20SS connected to ODS, followed by elution with water-acetonitrile. Fractions containing the compound of interest were collected and pH-adjusted to 7 with a 0.2 mol/L aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. A piece of dry ice was added to the mixture. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was freeze-dried to afford the compound I-039 as a powder (yield amount 121 mg, yield 70%).
