Particular embodiments of the invention are described in the following Examples, which serve to illustrate the invention in more detail without limiting its scope in any way. EXAMPLES To illustrate the usefulness of this invention, the association of the compound of formula (I), administered orally at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg, with tadalafil, administered orally at a dose of 10 mg/kg, has been studied in two different hypertension models, namely the Dahl salt-sensitive rat model and the spontaneously hypertensive rat model. Furthermore, the association of the compound of formula (I), administered orally at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg, with sildenafil, administered orally at a dose of 30 mg/kg, has been studied in the spontaneously hypertensive rat model. The protocols used are detailed in the part entitled “Pharmacological properties of the invention compounds” hereafter. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF THE INVENTION COMPOUNDS The experimental methods described hereafter can be used to show the pharmacological properties of the invention compounds. Dahl salt-sensitive rat model Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl-S) were purchased from Harlan (Netherlands). The rats were housed by group during the acclimatization period and single-housed after implantation of the telemetry device. All animals were maintained under identical conditions and had free access to normal pelleted rat chow and water. Dahl salt-sensitive rats develop hypertension only upon exposure to salt intake. They were administered a high-salt (8%) chow diet (Purina series 5500). Five weeks after starting salt administration, a telemetry system was implanted under anaesthesia by inhalation of 2.5% isoflurane (in 70% Ο2 + 30% Ν2Ο). Under aseptic conditions, a pressure radio-frequency transmitter was implanted into the peritoneal cavity, and a sensing catheter was inserted in the descending aorta and advanced pointing upstream to slightly below the renal artery bifurcation. The transmitter was sutured to the abdominal musculature and the skin was closed. A receiver platform transformed the radio signal into digitized input, that was sent to a dedicated personal computer (Compaq, deskpro). Arterial blood pressure measurements were calibrated by using an input from an ambient pressure reference. Telemetry units were obtained from Data Sciences (St. Paul, ΜΝ, USA). The compounds were administered at least 2 weeks after telemetry system implantation. The compound of formula (I) and the compound having PDE5-inhibitory properties were prepared in 5% arabic gum and administered by oral gavage. The acute effects of the compound of formula (I), the compound having PDE5-inhibitory properties and their combination on blood pressure were measured by collecting data at 5-minute intervals up to 72 h after oral administration. Hourly means of blood pressure were calculated for each rat. Each rat served as its own control, by using the blood pressure data of the last 24 hours before drug administration. The two curves (blood pressure of the control period and blood pressure of the treatment period) were plotted together and the area between curves (ABC) from 0 to 72 hours was calculated. The higher the ABC, the stronger the effect of the item tested for lowering blood pressure. Spontaneously hypertensive rat model The same protocol was used as for the Dahl salt-sensitive rat model, except that spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) replace the Dahl-S rats and that the SHR rats did not receive any salt diet. The SHR rats were purchased from Harlan (Netherlands). Test for the determination of PDE5 IC50: In order to estimate the extent of inhibition for PDE5 activity of a test compound, the following test is carried out. Phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme (PDE 5} is separated from human corpus cavernosa! tissues. About 3 g of this tissue is homogenized with 12 ml of HEPES buffer (20 mM HEPES, 250 raM sucrose, 1 mV) EDI'A, 1 mM PMSE, pH 7.2) at 4°C. The solution is filtered with double-layered gauze and centrifuged (100,000 xg) for 60 min at 4°C. The supernatant is filtered with 0.2 μΐη filter paper and separated by HPLC (Mono Q anion exchange column) with concentration gradient of 0-500 mM NaCl to elute PDE isozymes. The enzyme activity is measured on each column fraction by the following process to separate the PDE5 fraction and the PDE5inhibition of the test compound is measured using the PDE5 fraction. To 1.5 ml tube are added 100 μΐ of reaction mixture (15 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl?, 0.5 mg/ml BSA, pH 7.4) and the appropriate amount of test compound fraction and test compound and the mixture is mixed well. To this solution is added Η-℮ΑΜΡ or "'H-cGMP (500 tiM. 2 pCi/ml), the mixture is reacted in the incubator of 30 °C for about 1 hour and the reaction is quenched by putting the tube into boiling water for about 45 seconds to 2 min. Then the tube is chilled in ice bath for about 5 min. To this tube is added snake venom (1 mg/ml, 100 μ1) or 5-nuclootidase (0.1 unit/tube) and the mixture is reacted in an. incubator at 37 °C for 10 min and chilled in an ice bath. 3 times volume of methanol to the resin is added to the anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad™ resin, AG1-X2,200-400 mesh) which has been already washed with 0,5ArHCl, EfcO, 0,5/V NaOH, HjO, 0.5Λ7 HC1 and HjO in order and adjusted to pH 5. Then 1 ml of the pretreated resin is dispensed into each tube with vortexing. The mixture is left at 4 °C for 15 min with occasional vortexing and centrifuged (10,000 rpm) for about 5 min to sediment the resin. The supernatant (700 μ1) is transferred to a liquid scintillation vial, and mixed with 10 ml of scintillation cocktail. After stabilizing the solution, by leaving it overnight, the radioactivity of the tube is measured by ^counter. If the test compound has an IC50 equal or lower than 1 μΜ, it is considered as having PDE5-inhibitory properties for the purpose of this patent application. If the test compound has an IC50 higher than 1 μΜ, it is considered as not having PDE5-inhibitory properties for the purpose of this patent application. EXAMPLE 1 Following the test protocol described previously in the part entitled “Dahl salt-sensitive rat model”, oral administration of the compound of formula (I) and tadalafil decreased blood pressure in Dahl-S rats: the compound of formula (I) (0.3 mg/kg) decreased blood pressure with an ABC of 256 and tadalafil (10 mg/kg) with an ABC of 310. The ABC after oral administration of the combination (compound of formula (I) at 0.3 mg/kg and tadalafil at 10 mg/kg) was 923, demonstrating a synergistic effect. EXAMPLE 2 Following the test protocol described previously in the part entitled “Spontaneously hypertensive rat model”, oral administration of the compound of formula (I) and tadalafil decreased blood pressure in SHR rats: the compound of formula (1) (0.3 mg/kg) decreased blood pressure with an ABC of 44 and tadalafil (10 mg/kg) with an ABC of 286. The ABC after oral gavage of the combination (compound of formula (I) at 0.3 mg/kg and tadalafil at 10 mg/kg) was 444, confirming the synergistic effect. EXAMPLE 3 Following the test protocol described previously in the part entitled “Spontaneously hypertensive rat model”, oral administration of the compound of formula (I) and sildenafil decreased blood pressure in SHR rats: the compound of formula (I) (0.3 mg/kg) decreased blood pressure with an ABC of 38 and sildenafil (30 mg/kg) with an ABC of 229. The ABC after oral gavage of the combination (compound of formula (I) at 0.3 mg/kg and sildenafil at 30 mg/kg) was 317, confirming the synergistic effect. 1.
