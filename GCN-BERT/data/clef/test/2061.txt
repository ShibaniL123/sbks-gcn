CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Not Applicable FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE OF MATERIAL SUBMITTED ON A COMPACT DISK Not Applicable BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Various types of plush toys are known in the prior art. However, what is needed is an allergen resistant plush toy comprising an allergen barrier fabric covering wherein the allergen barrier fabric includes a tightly constructed fabric substrate. The fabric substrate is finished to a mean pore size of less than 10 microns, is air, heat and vapor permeable, is durable and soft in texture. This fabric substrate provides a barrier to prevent or impede passage of an object having a diameter greater than 10 microns, such as dust, dust mites, pet dander or other allergens through the fabric while being durable enough to withstand many washings. The allergen resistant plush toy is stuffed with a hypoallergenic stuffing and is sewn with a synthetic thread using a microneedle to minimize openings in the fabric. Alternately the seams are bonded to prevent dust mite and allergen penetration through the seams and to enhance durability. The materials and construction of the allergenic resistant plush toy are configured to reduce the risk of immune response to allergens normally found on plush toys. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to plush toys, and more particularly, to an allergen resistant plush toy comprising an allergen barrier fabric substrate covering, hypoallergenic stuffing and a plurality of seams. The plurality of seams is constructed using microneedles and synthetic thread and alternately the plurality of seams is bonded. The materials and the construction are configured to prevent or impede passage of dust, dust mites, pet dander or other allergens through the fabric thereby reducing the risk of immune response to allergens normally found on plush toys. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The general purpose of the present allergen resistant plush toy, described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide an allergen resistant plush toy which has many novel features that result in an allergen resistant plush toy which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by prior art, either alone or in combination thereof. To accomplish this, the present allergen resistant plush toy includes an allergenic barrier fabric covering formed in the shape of a figure, wherein the allergenic barrier fabric includes a tightly constructed allergen barrier fabric substrate finished to a mean pore size of less than 10 microns. The fabric substrate is also air, heat and vapor permeable, while also being durable and having a soft texture. The fabric substrate configured to provide a barrier to prevent or impede passage of an object having a diameter greater than 10 microns such as dust, dust mites, pet dander or other allergens therethrough. The allergen resistant plush toy also includes an interior cavity filled with a hypoallergenic stuffing, wherein the hypoallergenic stuffing comprises synthetic fibers, natural fibers or memory foam. The allergen resistant plush toy comprises a plurality of seams wherein the plurality of seams is constructed using synthetic thread and microneedles to minimize holes in the allergenic barrier substrate. Alternately, the plurality of seams is bonded to prevent passage of dust mites and allergens through the seams. Thus has been broadly outlined the more important features of the present allergen resistant plush toy so that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figures FIG. 1 is a front elevation view. FIG. 2 is a rear elevation view. FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view taken along line 3-3 of FIG. 2. FIG. 4 is an in-use view. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS With reference now to the drawings, and in particular FIGS. 1 through 4 thereof, an example of the instant allergen resistant plush toy employing the principles and concepts of the present allergen resistant plush toy and generally designated by the reference number 10 will be described. Referring to FIGS. 1 through 4, the present allergen resistant plush toy 10 is illustrated. The allergen resistant plush toy 10 includes an allergenic barrier fabric covering 20 forming the shape of a FIG. 90, but not limited said shape. The allergenic barrier fabric covering 20 comprises a tightly constructed fabric substrate 30, which can be formed of a synthetic or a natural substance. The fabric substrate 30 has a mean pore size of less than 10 microns. The fabric substrate 30 is further air, heat, and vapor permeable, is durable, and has a soft texture. The fabric substrate 30 is configured to provide a barrier to prevent or impede passage of an object having a diameter greater than 10 microns, such as dust mites 45 and allergens 47 through the fabric substrate 30. A continuous interior cavity 48 is disposed within the covering 20. A hypoallergenic stuffing 49 is contained within the interior cavity 48. The hypoallergenic stuffing comprises synthetic and, alternately natural, fibers, but can also be formed of viscoelastic foam. A plurality of seams 50 are used to construct the shape of a FIG. 90, wherein the plurality of seams 50 are sewn using synthetic thread and microneedles and alternately are bonded to further prevent passage of dust mites and allergens through the allergenic barrier fabric covering 20. 1.
