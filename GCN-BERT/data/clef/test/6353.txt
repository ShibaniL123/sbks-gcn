Preparation of (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl) methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
Acetic acid (0.392 ml, 6.84 mmol) was added to (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (0.593 g, 1.37 mmol) in CHCl3 (5 mL), and the resulting solution was cooled to 0° C. Isopentyl nitrite (0.321 g, 2.74 mmol) in CHCl3 (1 mL) was added to the reaction dropwise, and the reaction was stirred at 0° C. for another 2 hours. Then saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (1 g in 20 mL of water) was added slowly. The reaction was stirred at 0° C. for 10 minutes, and then the layers were separated. The organic layer was purified by flash column chromatography, elution gradient 5 to 35% ethyl acetate in hexanes, to afford (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2-methoxyphenyl)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (0.299 g, 49.2%) as light brown solid.
