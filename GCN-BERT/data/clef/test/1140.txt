This invention relates to surface Imyers, and particularly to surface layers for types of composite board that are made of fibrous material impregnated with resinous binders. Such Alpes of composite board are used for cabinet rk and '« ll panelin3 and it is desirable that they have good mechanical strength, that they be free of any tendency to warp, and that their surfaces be resistant to the action of moisture, as well as to the action of acids, alkalis, and solvents. Composite board of adequate strength can be produced by hot pressìngfiber impregnated Raith natural resins or with phenolic resins, and such board is comparatively free of any tendency to v rp and is satisfactorily resistant te the action of moisture, solvents, and active chemicals. Because of the yellovrlsh or brownish color of the resins used as binders, however, such board can be made on!y in dark or yellowish shades, even thou:;h white fibrous filler be used. Also, it is lìable to discolor under the influence of li!çht. For some purposes, panelìnö of light shade or brilliant coloring ìs highly desirable. Such paneling can be produced by impregnating white or suitably colored sheets of paper with colorless or appropriately colored formaldehyde-urea resin and then hot pressing piles of such sheets. Formaldehyde-urea resin, pure white paper and pigmented paper are all comparatively expensive, however, and the mechanical strength of sheets made of paper impregnated with fomnaldehyde-urea resin is ot as threat as that of the best grade of pressed wood sheets or the best tirade of sheets made of fiber impregnated with phenolic resins. Attempts have been made te improve the appearance of board made of fiber impregnated with phenolic resins, by incorporatirL3 thereon surface sheets of white or pigmented paper impregnated with formaldehyde-urea resins, but such attempts have not resulted in wholly acceptable products for the reason that the dark phenolic impregnated bo r is liable to show through the formaldebç:de-urea 9 upre[;nated s!çin unequally,/, and ive the panels a blotched appearance, and for the further reason that evenly pi:mented paper is ot readily available. Panels made by incorporatin5 surface sheets of foì aldehydeurea irapre nated paper våth comnosite board -hose principa! body is made of fiber impersonated with pheno!ic or natural resins also have a tendency to warpath. (<rear care must be1posed in the manufacture of such board to avoid imperfections rõsultinfç from v inklin or tearSnç of the surface sheets during pressinçl operations, and it is practìca!l[f impossible to make the bond between the surface sheet and the bod of the board effectivó enough to insure against splittin ç; or peeling3 away of the snrface sheet under the influence of changes in atmospheric condìtions. The product of the invention retains "the snood features of phenolic and natural resin impre ;hated structures, and imparts to such structures the highly desirable finish and colorìnz of formaldehyde-urea impregnated materìals without oa sio»; any tendency to warpath or surface-sheet separation, and achieves these advantages with greater eoo oi v of manufacture than is possible hen formaldehydeurea impregnated paper sheets are ìncorporated with bodies that are impregnated with other resìus. In the first step of the process of the invention, urea is dissolved ìn formalin, the molecular proportions of formaldehyde to urea preferably being about 1.5 tools of formaldehyde to 1 mol of urea, though other ratios ranking from 1.1 : 1 to 2 : 1 may be used. The pH of the solution is adjusted to a standard value near neutrality and the solution is allowed to stand while an addition reaction between the urea and formaldehyde takes place, the temperature of the solution during the standing period being kept below 60° C to inhibit premature formation of insoluble compounds. The addition reaction which takes place in the solution results in the formation of methylol ureas, principally monomethylol and d methy!ol n-eas (the d':er t!'.e nol cu].t:çr rat:fo o!' ['orí <d.dehydc %o urea, the rester the proportion of dimctì:y]ol). The time required for the reaction depends upon the temperature ai which the solution is Maintained. if the end of the reaction the condition of the solution is that of a t!,in syrup. Cellulose, preferably:;, iç, the :('em of paner or pulp, is o},en stirred vñth the solution until thorou th and uniform absorption of the solution by the cellulose is attained, the cellulose bein; shredded either before or durinö the stirring operation. The acidity of the mass ma'j be increased somewhat for the stirrìn!ç operation te promote the next sta!,;e of reaction, during v4ììch the methylol ureas condense v«ith the spliti.in: ofç oç r,oEter. In the process of the invention, the condensation takes place in a drier, n w]1 ic} the wet ss is placed after stirring. The temperature durin,ì; the drying.: is : ro::ressivels increased But is not permitted to exceed I00° C, and the drying is ce vt.inued until the moisture contempt of the mass is reduced to less than lO;L,. Evaporation of water during the dryì.n g is faoilfLtated by the spread of the solution over the immense area of the cellulose fibers, and the cellulose, in addition, appears te have a catalytic cf£ect that promotes the elimination of chemically combined ter by condensation. ter "the dr3°in the cellulose with its loadin,ç of molecularly distributed e, ondeusate is placed in a ball mill and oround te a very fine powder. Durìn the grinding, pigments, opacity-increasing materìals such as titanium oxide, hot plate lubricants and conditioners such as accelerators or retarders may be added and ground into intir oEte mixture with the impregnated cellulose particles. The nature and quantity of the pigments and other conditioning materials added will depend uoon the type of article with which the material is to be finally incorporated and upon the appearance and surface characteristics that it is desired to produce. Particles of brì<ht metal may be scattered through -Sthe mass, to produce scintillation specks in the surface sheet. The amount of cellulose employed can be varied from one-third to pumice the eumount of resin, but povrders eontain5n from 401 to f of ce!lu!ose have been found to 2ive excellent results. In the application of the compound to the bod$r for vÆich it is te ferry the surface layer, it is first placed in about three parts of water to one part of oov;der, and susoension and uniform distribution of the solid particles in the liquid vehicle is attained by stirring er grindin7 the powder and water toe, ether in a ball mill, the temperature of the voter beìní! kept lovz. When a powder so prepared is placed in ter, an aqueous suspension of the cellulose particles is formed, but substantial proportion of the condensation product with vehicle the cellulose particles are iml regn çbed is hydrolyzed and dissolved b$i %ho water. The resulting composition is ìn the form of a thi batter that is free-fle%vìn and can therefore be readìl ; applìed as a surface coating. The impersonation of the cellulose «vith the ferm %ideh?Ideurea condensation product prier to the ï rlnd5nç operation makes the cellulose brittle and oases it to be reduced to a fìue powder during the zrìnd n!!: instead of beinö merely shredded into loose fibers. The thin or free-flowing nature of the aqueous suspensìon is due te the reduction of the impregnated cellulose to a fine povaìer during the grìndinç operation and also to the residual portion of the condensatìon product carried by the cellulose which does not dissolve in the voter. This remaining portion of the condensate overcomes the normal absorbent nature of the cellulose, and prevents the cellu!ose from producing) a solid cake by absorbing the v«ater in which it is placed when a reasonable amount of voter is used. If desired the addition of ointment, instead of being made during the dru: i rindin ma : be deferred until the powder is ground v 5th the water. V :ere rapid drain: is inquired, liquid vehicles ore volatile than water may bé e:çployçd. Examples of suc]: liquids are volatile hydrocarbons, benzine, and methyl and ethy! ethers. The formaldehyde-urea condensation oroduot in a oovÆler prepared as hereinbefore described is insoluble in benzine, methyl ether or ethyl ether. The thin baiter r.d:ich results from Ærindinz the »owder and eater together is spra -ed upon the body for w}:iob it is to form the surface layer, after which it is af ai?: dried.

The opacity of the surface layer when pediments er opaoifiers arc employed is suc!: that the color of the body does not show throu.:h if even »,,heu a black body is covered by a recite or ver: li,:ht-colcred coatiu': layer.

Translucent coatings can be :made in accordance vìtb the invention "be provide translucent panels when materials are employer for Che body portion of the panels that are capable of :iivlng translucent products. The surface layer of the ìnvention may be hot pressed upon boards or articles which are neither thermoplastic nor thermosertirez, or which are so slit;htly thermoplastic as not to be greatly affected by the heat and pressure employed in formìng the surface coating, or the surface coating may be applied to boards or articles of thermoplastic or thermosetting materials, particularly lmuinated boards, as they are formed under heat and pressure. In such case, the flore properties of the material from which the body of the article is formed and the flow properties of the composition of the surface layer should be such that the heat and oressuïe requited to :?or : - «' body c/Pe a hDroximD.-tely the sa'ne as that required te form s.nd set the surface layer. !Jeans for adjustinL flout properties of ther:uoplastic and the m osetti z comoositions are k lovm tu the art, and the flow properties and curing:: tiTae of the composition of the surface layer "my be adjusted by var:/inö the proportion of cellulose te resin OEnd by the use of ,»!asticizers, accelerators and retarders such as are employed in conditionin'J; urea-fonualdehyde moldin,:: coìmoositions. !Yhen the surface coating of the inveutìon is te be aUplied to laminated board made of larders of paper ìmpreõnated VF1 th heat hardening resin, sheets of the impregnated paper are sprayed on one side vith the water or non-solvent liquid suspension of fine po xler. The sprayed sheets are then dried flat, e-md v,,hon file other sheets of impersonated paper are arranged in nìles te be pressed into laminated board, one of the sheets upon whìoh the composition has been sprayed aud dried is pl,%oed ah the bottom of the pile with the sprinted surface down and u other placed on top of the pile with the sprayed surface up. The pile of sheets is then hot pressed lu the same maser as in ['he usual laminating process, the heat and pressure used dòpendì i on the flow properties of the impregnatìn g resin used lu the body sheets and the flow properties of the coatinìj composition, and the time during vahich heat and pressure are applied depending upon the curing properties. It is often desirable in maldnç laminated sheets to cool the pressure plates before relievin 7 the pressure, se that the sheets may be taken from the press stiff and flat. In pressboard thus made, the bond between the surface layer and the body of the material is superior even to the bond between the body sheets, since the composition employed in the surface layer penetrates into the fibers of the adjacent body material and amal j;æuates vzith the body material resin. 'ihere is no liability that the surface l % er frill separate from the body by splittinï off or peeling. The cellulose cow, tent of the surface layer material not only has a beneficial function durSn; the condensation stare of the reaction, but it also rives te the finished surface coattail qualities -÷rhieh prevent it from chipping and crazing, as do pure urea-forty, aldehyde resinous bodies and those containinS minerals and other non-cellulosic fillers. The surface layer of the invention possesses the tortues of surface sheets made by impreçnatìn : sheets of paper with urea-fore,aldehyde resin, without their defects and disadvan%azes, and the surface layer of the invention is much more economical te make and apply. /. ere the characteristics of urea-formaldehyde resins are not required, the fibrous material may be impregnated with other resins such, for example, as phenolic resins. The impersonated liber may be paper pulp, wood flour or other cellulosic materìal. In any case it fs finely ground and placed in suspensìon i l ter or some volatile liquid that does uot remove the resin from the fiber by dìssolvinf, it. The surface sheet may also be applied by nleans other than spraying.
