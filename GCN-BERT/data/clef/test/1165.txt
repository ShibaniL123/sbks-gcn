BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Potassium citrate is used clinically to treat kidney stones by alkalizing the urinary pH and increasing urinary citrate concentration. However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited by its gastrointestinal complications such as irritation and ulcerations. Extended-release tablets of potassium citrate could minimize these side effects and have been shown to lead to sustained elevation of urinary pH and citrate concentration (Pak et al., 1984). Considerable difficulties have been encountered in the preparation of extended-release matrix tablets containing potassium citrate. Potassium citrate is very soluble in water and the dosage required is very high. The only way to extend the release of potassium citrate tablet while keeping the tablet size acceptable for swallowing is to use a hydrophobic wax matrix, such as carnauba wax, wherein the total amount of inactive ingredients is below 25% w/w. When the drug content is low, the carnauba wax can be dry mixed with the drug and other inactive ingredients prior to compression. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,904,478 teaches an extended-release wax matrix tablet of a highly water-soluble drug, sodium fluoride, wherein the carnauba wax, present at 35-70% w/w of the tablet weight, is dry mixed with the drug and other inactive ingredients prior to compression. In the case of potassium citrate, because the drug dosage is high, the inactive ingredients including the extended-release agent(s) must be kept below 25% w/w to keep the tablet size acceptable for swallowing. If carnauba wax is used at less than 25% w/w, prior art teaches that the drug and carnauba wax should be heated until the carnauba wax liquefies, as described in Example 1 of US 2008/0131504 A1 (Mission Pharmacal, San Antonio, Tex., USA) to give an acceptable extended-release profile and friability. Friability is a measure of the durability of the tablet from the time it is compressed, to packaging, and to the time of use. The process of US 2008/0131504A1 for making extended-release potassium citrate tablet containing carnauba wax is difficult. Heating until the carnauba wax liquefies requires a lot of time and then there is the problem of discharging the molten potassium citrate-carnauba wax mixture from the mixer. The cooled mass is extremely hard; therefore the molten mass must be poured into molds so that the cooled mixture is of appropriate size for feeding into a comminuting machine. A simpler process for making the extended-release potassium citrate tablet is described in PCT/PH2012/000013, which surprisingly found that extended-release potassium citrate tablets containing carnauba wax could be produced without melting the wax. The potassium citrate-carnauba wax mixture is heated to a temperature below the temperature at which carnauba wax liquefies, and then discharged from the mixer as granules. The temperature is preferably higher than 55° C., and most preferably higher than 60° C. The cooled granulate can then be fed directly into a comminuting machine for size reduction, after which a lubricant is added, and the final mixture compressed into tablets. The tablet produced according to PCT/PH2012/000013 has the same dissolution profile as tablet produced by totally melting the wax. Hereafter, we will use melt-granulation and heat-granulation to refer to the processes described in US 2008/0131504A1 and PCT/PH2012/000013, respectively. Mission Pharmacal, the innovator of the extended-release potassium citrate tablet, sells the tablet under the brand name Urocit-K, in three strengths: 5-meq, 10-meq, and 15-meq tablets. The daily dose of Urocit-K is 30-60 meq, which requires 6-12 tablets of the 5-meq, 3-6 tablets of the 10-meq, and 2-4 tablets of the 15-meq. Urocit-K is a wax matrix tablet containing potassium citrate, carnauba wax as extended-release agent, and magnesium stearate as lubricant. Because of the large daily dose of potassium citrate, the preferred strength is the high dose 15-meq tablet. However, the 15-meq Urocit-K tablet, the only high dose tablet commercially available, has difficulty complying with the USP dissolution requirement. There is therefore a need for a robust high dose extended-release potassium citrate tablet that consistently passes USP dissolution requirement and with acceptable friability. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have surprisingly found that high dose extended-release potassium citrate tablets can be produced by replacing a portion of the melt- or heat-granulated potassium citrate with non-granulated potassium citrate. Contrary to expectation, replacing a portion of the melt- or heat-granulated potassium citrate with non-granulated potassium citrate does not lead to tablets with poorer friability. The tablet of this instant invention has good friability and consistently passes the USP dissolution. Further, because melt- or heat-granulation is the most difficult step of the production process, replacing a portion of the melt- or heat-granulated potassium citrate with non-granulated potassium citrate increases production capacity and reduces production cost. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Extended-release potassium citrate tablet must comply with USP 35. Dissolution is performed in 900 ml water, apparatus 2 at 50 rpm, and must comply with the following dissolution specifications: TABLE 1 (dissolution, 12 units) Time All Units Average 30 min 30-60% 35-55% 1 hour 45-75% 50-70% 3 hour ≧75% ≧80% Friability was measured in an Erweka TAR20. Briefly, ten tablets were placed inside a baffled 287 mm ID drum. The drum was rotated at 25 rpm for 4 minutes. The difference in the total tablet weight before and after rotating the drum divided by the initial tablet weight is the friability. The desired friability for high dose extended-release potassium citrate tablet is not more than 3%. Comparative Example 1 Three different commercial lots of 10-meq Urocit-K tablets were purchased, and subjected to USP 35 dissolution. The results are as follows: TABLE 2 Lot 1 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 43.6-47.6% 45.2% 1 hour 57.9-61.1% 60.4% 3 hour 87.9-97.4% 91.7% TABLE 3 Lot 2 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 41.2-44.5% 43.3% 1 hour 54.7-58.9% 57.7% 3 hour 82.5-89.4% 87.7% TABLE 4 Lot 3 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 42.8-44.7% 43.6% 1 hour 56.4-59.0% 57.4% 3 hour 85.5-88.4% 86.5% All three lots comply with USP 35 requirement for extended-release potassium citrate tablet. The average dissolution at 30 min and 1 hour are close to the mean values of the USP specifications at 45% and 60%, respectively. Example 2 Three batches of 10-meq tablets were prepared by using the heat-granulation technique of PCT/PH2012/000013. Each batch is 100,000 tablets. The formulation is given in Table 5. TABLE 5 Ingredient mg/tablet % w/w Potassium citrate•H2O 1080 85 Carnauba wax 177 14 Magnesium stearate 13 1 The procedure is as follows: 1. The potassium citrate was comminuted in a Fitzmill D6, knives forward, using perforated screen mesh 8.2. The comminuted potassium citrate from #1 was mixed with carnauba wax in a sigma mixer for 20 minutes.3. The granule from #2 was comminuted in a Fitzmill D6, knives forward, using perforated screen mesh 12.4. The granule from #3 was heated in a jacketed sigma mixer, with continued mixing. Heating was continued until the temperature reached 70° C., which is below the melting point of carnauba wax.5. The granule from #4 was discharged into plastic drums and allowed to cool to room temperature.6. The cooled granule from #5 was comminuted in a Fitzmill D6, knives forward, using perforated screen mesh 16.7. Magnesium stearate was passed through mesh 30 and mixed with the comminuted granule of #6 in a sigma mixer for 2 minutes.8. The granule from #7 was compressed into 18.9×8.6 mm elliptical tablet in a Stokes-Pennwalt rotary tablet press model 900. Tablet hardness was 11-13 kp, and the friability for the three batches was less than 3%. The dissolution profile is as follows: TABLE 6 Batch 1 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 43.5-48.8% 46.8% 1 hour 59.6-63.8% 61.9% 3 hour 89.9-94.7% 92.8% TABLE 7 Batch 2 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 44.2-45.7% 44.8% 1 hour 59.4-62.6% 61.0% 3 hour 91.2-98.6% 93.5% TABLE 8 Batch 3 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 44.0-45.2% 44.7% 1 hour 58.9-59.7% 59.3% 3 hour 88.0-89.8% 89.1% All three batches comply with USP 35 requirement for extended-release potassium citrate tablet. The average dissolution at 30 min and 1 hour are close to the mean values of the USP specifications at 45% and 60%, respectively. Comparative Example 3 Three different commercial lots of 15-meq Urocit-K tablets were purchased. The tablet weight of the 15-meq is 1.5× of the 10-meq Urocit-K tablet indicating that the two strengths are multiples of each other. The USP dissolution results are as follows: TABLE 9 Lot 1 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 36.7-42.2% 39.1% 1 hour 49.9-53.2% 51.4% 3 hour 74.8-82.4% 77.9% TABLE 10 Lot 2 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 37.1-40.2% 38.7% 1 hour 50.9-61.0% 55.2% 3 hour 79.7-82.8% 80.8% TABLE 11 Lot 3 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 35.2-39.0% 37.2% 1 hour 49.9-52.2% 51.1% 3 hour 74.2-82.8% 79.2% Two of the three lots fail USP dissolution. Further, the average values for the 30 min and 1 hour are close to the lower limits of the USP dissolution of 35% and 50%, respectively, indicating the formulation is not robust. Example 4 Three batches of 15-meq tablets were prepared by using the heat-granulation technique of PCT/PH2012/000013. Each batch is 67,000 tablets. The formulation in w/w percent is the same as Example 2, except that the tablet weight is 1.5× (1905 mg). The process of preparation is the same as Example 2 except that the granule was compressed into 22.5×9.3 mm elliptical tablets with hardness of 11-14 kp. Friability was less than 3% for the three batches. Dissolution was performed according to USP 35. The results are as follows: TABLE 12 Lot 1 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 37.9-41.5% 39.5% 1 hour 51.6-56.2% 54.5% 3 hour 82.1-87.3% 84.5% TABLE 13 Lot 2 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 36.1-38.2% 37.1% 1 hour 48.9-53.2% 50.2% 3 hour 73.2-80.9% 76.8% TABLE 14 Lot 3 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 35.6-39.6% 37.0% 1 hour 49.9-52.1% 51.2% 3 hour 74.0-82.9% 78.2% Two of the three batches fail USP dissolution. Further, the average values for the 30 min and 1 hour are close to the lower limits of the USP dissolution of 35% and 50%, respectively, indicating that this high dose extended-release tablet prepared according to prior art is not robust. Example 5 Three formulations of 15-meq tablets with varying concentrations of carnauba wax were prepared by using the heat-granulation technique of PCT/PH2012/000013. The formulations are given in Table 15: TABLE 15 15-meq Tablets (mg/tablet) Ingredient Example 5A Example 5B Example 5C Potassium citrate•H2O 1620 1620 1620 Carnauba wax 223 (12%) 182 (10%) 133 (7.5%) Magnesium stearate 19 18 18 The Process of preparation is the same as Example 2. The granules were compressed into 22.5×9.3 mm elliptical tablets. The results are as follows: TABLE 16 Example 5A (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 39.3-43.8% 40.2% 1 hour 53.2-57.7% 54.6% 3 hour 85.1-87.4% 86.7% The tablet hardness was about 10 kp, and friability was less than 3%. Note that reducing the carnauba wax from 14% in Example 4 to 12% in Example 5A did not change the mean dissolution values for the 30 min and 1 hour time points significantly. TABLE 17 Example 5B (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 47.0-50.1% 48.5% 1 hour 62.2-65.6% 63.7% 3 hour 95.4-100.0% 96.9% The maximum tablet hardness was 8.9 kp. While this formulation with 10% heat-granulated carnauba wax passes USP dissolution, the friability of 5.8% was not acceptable. TABLE 18 Example 5C (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 53.2-56.7% 54.8% 1 hour 70.3-74.1% 71.9% 3 hour 95.9-100.0% 98.1% The maximum tablet hardness was 7.0 kp, and these tablets with 7.5% heat-granulated carnauba wax failed friability (capped tablets) and USP dissolution. The examples of the prior art—Comparative Example 3, Example 4, Example 5A, Example 5B, and Example 5C—show that it is difficult to achieve a good balance of friability and robust dissolution for high dose extended-release potassium citrate tablet when all of the potassium citrate is melt- or heat-granulated with the carnauba wax. Example 6 Three formulations of 15-meq tablets with varying ratios of non-granulated and heat-granulated potassium citrate were prepared. The heat-granulated potassium citrate was prepared according to steps 1-6 of Example 2. This potassium citrate-carnauba wax heat-granulate is 85.9% potassium citrate and 14.1% carnauba wax. To prepare the non-granulated potassium citrate for dry addition, potassium citrate was comminuted in a Fitzmill D6, knives forward, medium speed using perforated screen mesh 14. The heat-granulated potassium citrate, and non-granulated potassium citrate were combined according to Table 19: TABLE 19 15-meq Tablets (mg/tablet) Example 6A Example 6B Example 6C 85/15 80/20 75/25 Heat-granulated potassium 1603 mg 1509 mg 1414 mg citrate-carnauba wax Non-granulated potassium 243 mg 324 mg 405 mg citrate monohydrate Magnesium stearate 19 mg 19 mg 18 mg The heat-granulated potassium citrate and the non-granulated potassium citrate were mixed in a Sigma mixer for 20 minutes. Magnesium stearate (passed thru mesh 30) was then added, and mixed for 3 minutes. The final granule was compressed into 22.5×9.3 mm elliptical tablet in a Stokes-Pennwalt rotary tablet press model 900. Example 6A contains 15% non-granulated potassium citrate, Example 6B contains 20% non-granulated potassium citrate, and Example 6C contains 25% non-granulated potassium citrate. The formulations of Table 19 in percent w/w is given in Table 20: TABLE 20 15-meq Tablets in mg/tablet (% w/w) Ingredient Example 6A Example 6B Example 6C Potassium citrate•H2O 1620 (86.9%) 1620 (87.5%) 1620 (88.2%) Carnauba wax 226 (12.1%) 213 (11.5%) 199 (10.8%) Magnesium stearate 19 (1%) 19 (1%) 18 (1%) These tablets were subjected to USP dissolution. Results are as follows: TABLE 21 Example 6A (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 42.4-45.6% 43.6% 1 hour 57.5-59.5% 58.2% 3 hour 88.9-92.9% 90.4% The tablet of Example 6A passes the USP dissolution, with the 30 min and 1 hour data close to the mean values of the USP dissolution specifications of 45% and 60%, respectively. The tablet hardness was 10 kp and friability was 1.9%. This example shows that combining heat-granulated potassium citrate and non-granulated potassium citrate according to this instant invention leads to high dose extended-release potassium citrate with good friability and robust dissolution.

The tablet hardness was 11 kp and friability was 1.4%. This example shows that combining heat-granulated potassium citrate and non-granulated potassium citrate according to this instant invention leads to high dose extended-release potassium citrate with good friability and robust dissolution. TABLE 23 Example 6C (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 44.2-50.3% 46.2% 1 hour 58.5-65.6% 62.2% 3 hour 97.5-100.0% 98.2% The tablet of Example 6C passes the USP dissolution, with the 30 min and 1 hour data close to the mean values of the USP dissolution specifications of 45% and 60%, respectively. The tablet hardness was 11.5 kp and friability was 1.8%. This example shows that combining heat-granulated potassium citrate and non-granulated potassium citrate according to this instant invention leads to high dose extended-release potassium citrate with good friability and robust dissolution. Example 7 Three additional large production-scale batches of 15-meq tablets according to Example 6B were prepared. Each batch is 83,000 tablets. Tablet hardness of the three batches was 10-12 kp, and friability was 1-2%. Dissolution was performed according to USP 35. The results are as follows: TABLE 24 Example 7 - Batch 1 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 45.4-47.1% 46.2% 1 hour 59.6-62.9% 61.2% 3 hour 89.3-95.4% 92.9% TABLE 25 Example 7 - Batch 2 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 44.7-45.9% 45.3% 1 hour 60.5-62.9% 61.4% 3 hour 93.3-97.0% 95.3% TABLE 26 Example 7 - Batch 3 (dissolution, 12 units) Time Range Average 30 min 44.8-48.1% 46.3% 1 hour 59.2-61.5% 60.3% 3 hour 89.9-93.3% 92.1% The above data clearly shows robust batch-to-batch dissolution and friability of the high dose extended-release potassium citrate tablets prepared according to this instant invention.
