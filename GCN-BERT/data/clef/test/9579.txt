Field The present disclosure is related generally to devices that can be used for organizing personal articles, and specifically to shelving systems. 2. Description of the Related Art Certain shelving devices, such as those commonly known as “shower caddies,” are used in a shower or bath enclosure to store and organize personal care articles, such as shampoo, soap, razors, toothbrushes, bath sponges, etc. Shower caddies typically include shelves or baskets for holding the personal care items. The collection of personal care articles on the shelving can sometimes appear cluttered or disorganized. SUMMARY Some shelving systems have a movable visually obscuring element, such as a shroud. The obscuring element can aid in concealing or covering one or more shelves and/or products carried by the shelves on the shelving system. This can enable a user to selectively hide the product on the shelves (e.g., for privacy and/or aesthetic reasons) and to selectively reveal the products (e.g., to allow access for use of the products). In some embodiments, a shelving system includes an elongate support member with a first end and a second end, and a longitudinal axis extending between the first and second ends. The system can include one or more shelf members for holding bathroom toiletries. The shelf member can be connected to the elongate support member with a connection mechanism. The shelving system can include a shroud member adapted to be rotatable between a first position corresponding to a closed position and a second position corresponding to an open position. The shroud member can be configured to generally surround a first portion of the shelf member in the closed position and can be configured to allow access to the first portion of the shelf member in the open position.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS Various improved shelving systems are described. The shelving systems are described in the context of a shower caddy, due to particular utility in that context. However, the embodiments and inventions disclosed herein can also be applied to other types of devices and other environments, such as shelving units for kitchens, living rooms, bedrooms, cabinets, offices, and other environments outside of a shower. Overview FIG. 1 schematically illustrates an embodiment of a shelving system, such as a shower caddy 10. As shown, the shower caddy 10 can include a shelf assembly 12 and a support member 14. The shelf assembly 12 can be coupled with the support member 14, such as to enable the shelf assembly 12 to be moved relative to (e.g., slid up and down along) the support member 14 and/or secured with the support member 14. In various embodiments, the support member 14 is configured to attach to a rigid structure of the environment, such as a shower pipe or a floor and/or ceiling of a shower. As shown, the shelf assembly 12 can include a shelf 16, which can be configured to support and/or organize bathing articles. The shelf assembly 12 can include a shroud 18 that is configured to selectively reveal and obscure the shelf 16 and the articles on the shelf 16. For example, the shroud 18 can be an opaque screen that can be rotated around the shelf 16. FIG. 2 illustrates another embodiment of a shower caddy 100. As shown, the shower caddy 100 can include a shelf assembly 101. The shelf assembly 101 can include a first support member 102 and one or more shelves 103. The shelf assembly 101 can be connected with a second support member 104, such via first and/or second arms 105, 106. As shown, the second support member 104 can be a rod assembly, which can be configured to extend between a floor and ceiling in a shower enclosure. As also shown, the shelf assembly 101 can include a shroud 107, which can be configured to obscure a portion of the shelves 103 from view. For example, as shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, the shroud 107 can be moved between a closed position (e.g., to obscure a portion of the shelves 103 from view) and an open position (e.g., to permit access and/or view of some or all of the shelves 103). Certain implementations have a soap tray 108, which can be rigidly or rotatably fixed to the first support member 102 or to one of the arms 105, 106. The shelves 103 can be configured to facilitate storage and/or drying of bath or shower items. For example, as illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, the shelves 103 can include drainage holes 142, a soap tray 108, towel rack, and/or other accessories (e.g., hooks, dividers, baskets, or organizers 144, etc.). In certain implementations, one or more of the shelves 103 have openings 146 for holding bottles of toiletries (e.g., shampoo) upside down, with the cap of the bottle extending through the openings 146. In some embodiments, the shelves 103 are configured to be the same or similar or include one or more of any of the features of any of the shelves or racks described with respect to U.S. Pat. No. 8,408,405, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the shelves 103 can include article containment features, such as raised edges or walls 117. The walls 117 can encircle or surround the entire or substantially the entire perimeter or circumference of the shelves 103. In some embodiments, the raised edges or walls 117 are solid walls. In other embodiments, the raised edges or walls 117 include one or more wires, cables, or cylindrical tubes instead of a solid wall construction or configuration. As described in further detail below, the shroud 107 can be configured to obscure the contents of at least one of the shelves 103. For example, the shroud 107 can be a cover, gate, shield, curtain, cabinet, or screen that inhibits or prevents viewing and/or accessing of the contents of the shelves 103 in certain configurations. In various embodiments, the shroud 107 is movable (e.g., rotatable, retractable, pivoted about a joint or pin, etc.) between a first position and a second position. The first position can be a position in which the contents of the shelves 103 are closed, hidden, or concealed. The second position can be a position in which the contents of the shelves 103 are open, accessible, or viewable. This can provide the ability to selectively obscure or reveal the contents of the shelves 103, such as depending on whether the shroud 107 is placed in the first or second position. In some embodiments, the shroud 107 is rotatable. In certain variants, the shroud 107 rotates about an axis A1 that extends axially through, and/or generally parallel to, a longitudinal axis of the first support member 102. In some embodiments, the shroud 107 rotates independently of or relative to the one or more shelves 103. In certain embodiments, the shroud 107 rotates relative to (e.g., around) the shelves 103. In some variants, the shroud 107 and shelves 103 rotate together. In some implementations, the shroud 107 has one degree of freedom of movement (e.g., around the axis A1). In certain variants, the shroud 107 has two degrees of freedom of movement (e.g., around the axis A1 and along an axis A2). In various embodiments, some, substantially all, or the entire shower caddy 100 is made of one or more corrosion-resistant materials. For example, the first support member 102 and/or the second support member 104 can be aluminum (e.g., extruded aluminum, formed satin aluminum that is bead blasted with clear anodizing, etc.). The support members 102, 104 may be constructed of other suitable materials, including, but not limited to, steel, stainless steel, or any other metal, plastics, wood, or any other material. Support Members With continued reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, the support members 102, 104 can each be in the form of an elongate member, such as a pole, shaft, rod, or otherwise. Either or both of the support members 102, 104 may be the same or similar to, or include one or more of any of the features of, any of the support or elongate members described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,408,405, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, the second support member 104 (and/or the first support member 102) can have a telescoping configuration. In some embodiments, upper and lower ends of one of the support members 102, 104 can be anchored against upper and lower stationary objects. For example, in some embodiments, a lower end of the second support member 104 can be pressed against the floor of a shower or bathtub and an upper end of the second support member 104 can be pressed against the ceiling above the shower or bathtub. The anchoring can occur with sufficient force to secure the entire shower caddy 100 in a desired position. The first and second support members 102, 104 can have various cross-sectional shapes. For example, the first and second support members 102, 104 can have a cross-sectional shape that is generally: cylindrical, circular, triangular, trapezoidal, rectangular, square, or other angular cross-sectional configuration. In some embodiments, the first and/or second support members 102, 104 have an I-beam shaped cross-section. In certain implementations, the first and second support members 102, 104 have the same cross-sectional shape. As shown, in some variants, the first and second support members 102, 104 have different cross-sectional shapes. For example, the first support member 102 can have a generally circular cross-sectional shape and the second support member 104 can have a non-circular cross-sectional shape, such as generally: rectangular, diamond shaped, or otherwise. This can aid in allowing components (e.g., the shelves 103) to rotate about the first support member 102 and can inhibit components (e.g., the shelf assembly 101) from rotating about the second support member 104. Arms As noted above, the shower caddy 100 can include first and/or second arms 105, 106. The arms 105, 106 can be configured to facilitate spacing the first support member 102 and/or the shelf assembly 101 apart from the second support member 104. This can allow clearance for the movement of the shroud 107, as will be discussed in more detail below. In some embodiments, the arms 105, 106 are configured to facilitate moving (e.g., sliding) the first support member 102 and/or the shelf assembly 101 relative to the second support member 104. This can allow the shelf assembly 101 to be placed at a desirable position (e.g., a convenient height to allow access to articles on the shelves 103). In some embodiments, the arms 105, 106 are configured to facilitate securing (e.g., coupling, connecting, locking) the shelf assembly 101 with the second support member 104. This can aid in maintaining the shelf assembly 101 at the desirable position. As shown in FIG. 3, the arms 105, 106 can connect the shelving assembly 101 with the second support member 104. In some embodiments, an end of the first arm 105 can be coupled to the shelf assembly 101 and another end of the first arm 105 can be coupled to the second support member 104. Similarly, an end of the second arm 106 can be coupled to the shelf assembly 101 and another end of the second arm 106 can be coupled to the second support member 104. In the illustrated embodiment, the arms 105, 106 connect to top and bottom portions of the first support member 102 of the shelf assembly 101, respectively. In some other embodiments, the first and/or second arms 105, 106 couple with other portions along the length of the first support member 102, such as at approximately: ¼ of the length, ⅓ of the length, ½ of the length, ⅔ of the length, ¾ of the length, or otherwise. As illustrated, in certain embodiments, the first and second arms 105, 106 extend generally orthogonally away from a longitudinal axis A2 of the second support member 104 and/or towards the first support member 102. The first and second arms 105, 106, respectively, can include a receiving element 105a, 106a, such as an aperture or recess. For example, as shown in FIG. 3, a portion of the second support member 104 can extend through the receiving elements 105a, 106a. In some embodiments, the receiving elements 105a, 106a and the second support member 104 have a corresponding or mating shape. In some embodiments, such a corresponding or mating shape can inhibit or prevent the one or more arms 105, 106 and/or the shelf assembly 101 from rotating about the second support member 104. For example, the shape can be polygonal (e.g., triangular, rectangular, etc.) or otherwise non-circular. In some embodiments, the first and/or second arms 105, 106 are movably connected to the second support member 104. For example, the arms 105, 106 and the shelf assembly 101 can slide vertically in an axial direction along the second support member 104. In some implementations, the arms 105, 106 and the shelf assembly 101 can rotate about the longitudinal axis A2 of the second support member 104. In some embodiments, the arms 105, 106 and the shelf assembly 101 can have at least one or two degrees of freedom relative to the second support member 104. As illustrated in FIG. 4, at least one of the first and second arms 105, 106 can include a locking mechanism 118. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the second arm 106 (e.g., a bottom arm) includes the locking mechanism 118. The locking mechanism 118 can be configured to releasably engage (e.g., secure, lock, or fix) the arms 105, 106 and the shelf assembly 101 with the second support member 104. This can enable the shelving assembly 101 to be moved relative to the second support member 104. In some embodiments, locking mechanism 118 is configured to be toggled between a locked position (e.g., in which the arms 105, 106 and the shelf assembly 101 are secured in position relative to the second support member 104) and an unlocked position (e.g., in which the arms 105, 106 and the shelf assembly 101 are movable along the longitudinal axis A2 of the second support member 104 and/or rotatable about the longitudinal axis A2 of the second support member 104). The locking mechanism 118 can include an actuatable component 120, such as a handle, lever, switch or otherwise. The actuatable component 120 can be movable between a first position and a second position corresponding to the locked and unlocked positions, respectively. An engagement mechanism 122, such as a pin, can be coupled to the actuatable component 120. In certain embodiments, when the actuatable component 120 is in the first position, the engagement mechanism 122 is engaged with a corresponding engagement structure 124 (e.g., hole, opening, channel, aperture, recess, etc.) in the second support member 104. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, a pin of the locking mechanism 118 can be received in an aperture in the second support member 104. This can provide a physical interference that inhibits the arm 106 (and/or the shelving assembly 101 as a whole) from moving relative to the second support member 104. In certain implementations, when the locking mechanism 118 is in the locked position, some or all of the weight of the shelf assembly 101 is transferred to the second support member 104 via the locking mechanism 118 (e.g., such as through the interference between the pin and the second support member 104). In certain embodiments, when the actuatable component 120 is in the second position, the engagement mechanism 122 and the corresponding engagement structure 124 are disengaged from each other. In some variants, the engagement mechanism 122 can be positioned away from and/or out of the engagement structure 124. For example, with reference to the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, the pin can be withdrawn from the aperture in the second support member 104, thereby removing the physical interference connecting the arm 106 and the second support member 104. This can allow the arm 106 (and/or the shelving assembly 101 as a whole) to be relative to the second support member 104. In some embodiments, the second support member 104 includes a plurality of the engagement structures 124 at various positions along and/or around the second support member 104, such as at various heights and/or positions about the circumference or outer perimeter of second support member 104. This can provide flexibility in selecting where to position the arm 106 along the second support member 104. In some embodiments, the actuatable component 120 of the locking mechanism 118 is configured for ready access by a user. For example, as shown, the actuatable component 120 can be located on the arm 106, such as on a lower surface of the arm 106. In some variants, during movement of the actuatable component 120 from the first position to the second position, the actuatable component 120 is pushed or pulled away from the second support member 104 and/or towards the first support member 102. In some embodiments, the actuatable mechanism 120 is moved within an aperture, recess, opening or space 128 in the arm 106. The locking mechanism 118 can include a biasing member 126, such as a spring. The biasing member 126 can bias the engagement mechanism 122 into engagement with the engagement structure 124. This can encourage the locking mechanism 118 toward the locked position. For example, in some variants, when no force is applied to the actuatable mechanism 120 by the user, then the engagement mechanism 122 is pushed toward the second support member 104 (e.g., toward the engagement structure 124). In various embodiments, the locking mechanism 118 can be spring-loaded. Shroud As previously mentioned, some embodiments include a shroud 107. The shroud 107 can be a cover, gate, shield, curtain, or screen that inhibits or prevents viewing of the contents of the shelves 103 in certain configurations. In the embodiment illustrated, the shroud 107 includes a curved opaque plate. In some embodiments, the shroud 107 is opaque (e.g., allows the passage therethrough of no or substantially no light). In some variants, the shroud 107 is translucent, thereby allowing passage therethrough of some light (e.g., less than or equal to about: 50%, 30%, 20%, 10%, 5%, values between the aforementioned values, or other values). The shroud 107 can be configured to enable a user to selectably obscure one or more of the shelves 103 and their contents from view. This can protect the privacy of a user by hiding certain articles on the shelves 103 from view. For example, during a party or other social occasion, the shroud 107 can hide articles on the shelves 103 from being observed by guests that use the bathroom in which the shower is located. The shroud 107 can enhance the aesthetic of a shower. Users may choose to store many different articles (e.g., shampoos, body washes, razors, wash cloths, etc.) on the shelves 103, which can lead to a disorganized appearance. Also, articles on the shelves 103 may drip or otherwise cause a mess, which can further reduce the aesthetic of the shower. The shroud 107 ameliorates such problems by hiding the shelves 103, as well as the articles and/or the associated mess. This can provide an organized and/or clean appearance of the shower. For example, the shroud 107 can provide a streamlined look for the shower. The ability, using the shroud 107, to conceal portions of the shelves 103 and/or personal articles positioned thereon (e.g., when not in use or as desired) can confer an improved quality, feel, functionality, and/or a more luxurious, seamless and aesthetically-pleasing appearance. As illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3, the shroud 107 can partially cover or surround portions of the one or more shelves 103. For example, as shown, the shroud 107 can extend around a portion of the circumference of the shelves 103 and fully or partially between a top plate 130 and a bottom plate 134 of the shelf assembly 101. In some embodiments, the shroud 107 includes a half or semi-circular, cylindrical, arced, or arched wall, plate, or base. In some embodiments, the shroud 107 has an angular, wedged, generally V-shaped, generally U-shaped, rectangular, and/or planar wall or base configuration. The shroud 107 can extend partially or substantially around the entire outer circumference or perimeter of the one or more shelves 103. For example, the shroud 107 can extend around a portion of the circumference or perimeter of the one or more shelves 103, such as at least ⅛, ¼, ⅜, ½, ⅝, ¾, ⅞, or any value between the aforementioned values. The shroud 107 can be configured to extend around various amounts of the circumference or perimeter of the one or more shelves 103, such as at least approximately: 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, 315° and/or any value therebetween. For example, in the embodiment illustrated, the shroud 107 extends around approximately 180 degrees (e.g., approximately half) of the circumference of the one or more shelves 103. In various embodiments, the shroud 107 can be configured to move (e.g., relative the shelves 103 and/or the second support member 104) between a first position and a second position. For example, the shroud 107 can be configured to rotate, retract, pivot, or slide between the first and second positions. In the first position, the shroud 107 can surround or cover at least a first portion of the shelves 103, such as a front or anterior portion. This can obscure from view (e.g., conceal, cover, hide, block, and/or render generally inaccessible) some or all of the shelves 103, as well as one or more personal articles (not shown) positioned on the shelves 103. In the second position, the shroud 107 can extend around a second portion of the shelves 103, such as a rear or posterior portion. This can provide ready access to, and viewing of, the articles on the shelves 103. In the embodiment illustrated, the shroud 107 rotates about a longitudinal axis A1 of the first support member 102. In certain variants, between the first and second positions, the shroud 107 rotates approximately 180° about A1. In some embodiments, the shroud 107 is configured to rotate about A1 at least about: 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, 90°, 105°, 120°, 135°, 150°, 165°, 195°, 210°, 225°, 240°, 255°, 270°, 285°, 300°, 315°, 330°, 345°, values between the aforementioned values, or other values. In certain embodiments, the shroud 107 can be moved to intermediate positions, such as positions between the first and second positions. This can provide flexibility in the amount of the shelves 103 that is concealed and revealed, and/or in the amount of access that is permitted to the shelves 103 and the articles thereon. In some embodiments, the shroud 107 is coupled to the top plate 130 and the bottom plate 134 of the shelving assembly 101. For example, as shown in FIG. 3, the shroud 107 can be coupled to the plates 130, 134 via one or more fastening members 132 (e.g., screw, pins, rivets, welds, or otherwise). In some embodiments, one or both of the plates 130, 134 has a shape that corresponds to the outer shape of one or all of the shelves 103. For example, as shown, the plates 130, 134 and the shelves 103 can each have a generally round peripheral shape. In certain embodiments, the plates 130, 134 have different shapes than the shelves 103. As shown in FIG. 4, one or both of the plates 130, 134 can have an opening or channel to facilitate airflow and/or drainage. In certain implementations, the top and bottom plates 130, 134 are coupled to the first and second arms 105, 106 via upper and lower collars 138, 136, respectively. The top and bottom plates 130, 134 can have openings through which the first support member 102 extends. In various embodiments, the shroud 107, plates 130, 134, and/or collars 138, 136 are rotatable about the first support member 102 (e.g., providing at least one degree of freedom) between at least the first and second positions. In various embodiments, the shelf assembly 101 includes features to facilitate rotation of the shroud 107. For example, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 5-7, the shelf assembly 101 can have lower and/or upper bearing assemblies 150, 170, such as bearings, bushings, or otherwise. The bearing assemblies 150, 170 can be configured to enable the shroud 107, plates 130, 134, and/or collars 136, 138 to rotate around the shelves 103 and/or the first support member 102. For example, in some embodiments, the shroud 107 is configured to rotate at least about 180° and/or less than or equal to about 360° around the shelves 103. In certain variants, shelves 103 and the shroud 107 remain rotationally fixed relative to each other (e.g., the shelves 103 and the shroud 107 are directly or indirectly rigidly connected together). In some implementations, the shelves 103 and the shroud 107 rotate around the first support member 102. In some embodiments, the bearing assemblies 150, 170 are positioned between the first support member 102 and the collars 138, 136, plates 130, 134, and/or arms 105, 106. For example, the bearing assemblies 150, 170 can be positioned around or adjacent an exterior surface of the first support member 102 and an interior surface of the collars 138, 136. In some embodiments, the upper bearing assembly 170 is coupled or connected to a downwardly extending inner surface 172 of the upper collar 138. The upper bearing assembly 170 is positioned between an outer surface of the first support member 102 and a perimeter of an aperture or hole in the upper plate 130. Such a configuration can allow the plate 130, shroud 107, and/or collar 138 to rotate about the first support member 102 extending through the aperture or hole in the upper plate 130. The upper plate 130 can be attached or coupled to the collar 138 by engagement or fastening members 174, such as screws or pins. In some implementations, the lower bearing assembly 150 is similarly rotatably connected with the first support member 102. Detent Assembly In some embodiments, one or both of the bearing assemblies 150, 170 includes a position facilitating assembly, such as a detent assembly. For example, in the shower caddy 100, the lower bearing assembly 150 includes the detent assembly. The detent assembly can be configured to bias or urge the shroud 107 into or towards one or more discrete and/or rotational positions. For example, the detent assembly can encourage the shroud 107 into or toward the first or second positions discussed above (e.g., an obscuring position and a non-obscuring position, closed position and an open, or otherwise). FIG. 8 illustrates an example of the detent assembly. As shown, the detent assembly can include a lower detent block 152. The lower detent block 152 can include one or more recesses 154 and one or more raised portions 157 (e.g., formed along an upper surface of the lower detent block 152). For example, as shown, the lower detent block can include first and second recesses 154 and first and second raised portions 157. In some implementations, the first and second recesses 154 and/or the first and second raised portions 157 are positioned at approximately opposite sides of the detent block 152 (e.g., spaced or positioned 180 degrees from each other and/or positioned at about 0° and 180°, respectively). The detent assembly can include an upper detent block 153. As shown, the upper detent block 153 can have one or more protrusions 158, such as a tab or ball. Some embodiments have first and second protrusions 158. As shown, the first and second protrusions 158 can be positioned on approximately opposite sides of the upper detent block 153. The detent assembly can include a biasing member, such as a spring 155. In certain variants, the spring 155 is compressed between the lower detent block 152 and the arm 106. In some embodiments, the spring 155 biases the lower detent block 152 upwardly and/or into engagement with the upper detent block 153. With continued reference to FIG. 8, the lower and upper detent blocks 152, 153 can interact to provide rotational rest positions. Such positions can be positions in which the blocks 152, 153 tend not to rotate relative to each other. In certain embodiments, a rotational rest position is achieved when corresponding features of the lower and upper detent blocks 152, 153 are rotationally aligned (e.g., raised portions of one of the detent blocks are received in recessed portions of the other, or vice versa). For example, in some embodiments, the recess 154 and/or the raised portion 157 of the lower detent block 152 can engage with the protrusion 158 on the upper detent block 153, which can urge the protrusion 158 into the recess 154 and can produce a rotational rest position. Similarly, in some embodiments, a lower surface of the upper detent block 153 can includes a recess that can be urged into juxtaposition with the raised portions 157 of the lower detent block 152, thereby producing a rotational rest position. In various embodiments, the number of recesses 154 and/or raised portions 157 determine the number of rotational rest positions for the shroud 107. For example, a pair of recesses can correspond to two rotational rest positions. In various implementations, when the upper detent block 153 is in a rotational rest position, the shroud 107 is in a rotational rest position as well. This is because, in some embodiments, the upper detent block 153 is rigidly connected with the shroud 107 (e.g., via the plate 134). In some variants, when the protrusion 158 is positioned within or generally aligned with a first recess, the shroud 107 is in a closed position, and when the protrusion 158 is positioned within or generally aligned with a second recess (e.g., located approximately 180 degrees from the first recess) the shroud 107 is in an open position. In some implementations, the bias of the spring 155 can aid in maintaining the blocks 152, 153 in the rotational rest position. In some embodiments, a plurality of (e.g., two or more) rotatable rest positions are provided, such as an open position, a closed position, and at least one intermediate position. For example, one, two, three, four, or more corresponding recesses 154, raised portions 157, and/or corresponding ramped surfaces 156 can be provided, such as on opposite sides or about 180° apart from each other on the lower detent block 152. Pairs of recesses 154 and raised portions 157 can be formed about 180° apart from each other at various positions between the closed and open positions. For example, pairs of recesses 154 and/or raised portions 157 can be formed on opposite sides of the detent block 152 at about: ±15°, ±30°, ±45, ±60°, ±75°, ±90°, ±105°, ±120°, ±135°, ±150°, ±165°, ±180°, 0° and 180°, value between the aforementioned values, or other values. This can provide flexibility in positioning the shroud 107 and/or provides the shroud 107 with multiple rotatable rest positions between the closed and open positions. Certain embodiments require an initial force to move the shroud 107 from a rotational rest position, such as the open and closed positions of the shroud 107. In some implementations, the initial force (e.g., a force that is generally tangential to the periphery of the shroud 107) must be sufficient to overcome a force of the spring 155 urging the protrusion 158 into the recess 154. In some embodiments, the detent assembly is configured to aid in rotating the shroud 107 to a rotational rest position. For example, when a user rotates the shroud 107 to a position between the closed and open position (or another position in which the protrusion 158 is not aligned with recess 154) and then releases the shroud 107, the detent assembly can motivate the shroud 107 to rotate to the open or closed positions (or another position in which the protrusion 158 is aligned with recess 154). In some implementations, when the shroud 107 is rotated from the closed position and the protrusion 158 is moved up the first ramped surface 156 towards the adjacent raised portion 157, and the shroud 107 is released, then the interaction of the spring 155, first ramped surface 156, protrusion 158, and detent block 152 will tend to urge the protrusion 158 back down the first ramped surface 156 toward alignment with the recess 154 and into the closed position. In certain variants, when the shroud 107 is rotated from the closed position and the protrusion 158 is moved up the first ramped surface 156 past the adjacent raised portion 157 to a second ramped surface 156 on a second side of the raised portion 157, and the shroud 107 is released, the interaction of the spring 155, second ramped surface 156, protrusion 158, and detent block 152 can motivate the protrusion 158 down the second ramped surface 156. This can urge the protrusion 158 into alignment with the second recess 154 (e.g., on the opposite side of the first recess 154). In some embodiments, in response to movement of the shroud 107 (e.g., by a user moving the shroud 107), the detent assembly (and thus the shroud 107) can appear to “automatically” move to a rotational position. For example, after a user applies an initial force (e.g., to move the protrusion 158 beyond an apex of the raised portion 157), the shroud 107 can appear to move the remainder of the way to the next rotational rest position on its own, such as because of the protrusion 158 being motivated down the ramped surfaces 156 into the recesses 154. In some implementations, the shower caddy 100 is configured to provide tactile feedback to a user during movement of the shroud 107. For example, the above-described manner in which the shroud 107 is maintained in one of the open and closed positions via the detent assembly, and/or in which the shroud 107 is moved between the open and closed positions, provides tactile feedback to the user. This can provide an indication to the user, such as a positioning of the shroud 107. In some implementations, the detent assembly facilitates substantially silent movement of the shroud 107 and/or can promote a smooth and elegant operation, which can suggest a high-quality of workmanship of the shower caddy 100. Clamping Mechanism As noted above, the caddy 100 can include one or more shelves 103. In some embodiments, the shelves 103 can be rotatable and/or adjusted in the vertical direction relative to the longitudinal axis A1 of the first support member 102 (e.g., move or articulate about two degrees of freedom). This can allow the shelves 103 to be positioned as desired (e.g., along and/or around the first support member 102) or to accommodate other devices or appliances that may be in a user's shower, as well as various sizes of items, such as toiletries, that may be oversized. Certain embodiments of the shower caddy 100 include features configured to selectively secure the shelves 103, such as a clamping mechanism 162. As shown in FIGS. 9 and 10, the clamping mechanism 162 can be configured to releasably secure and support one of the shelves 103 on the first support member 102. In some variants, one or more of the shelves 103 are rigidly or fixedly coupled to the first support member 102. The clamping mechanism 162 may be configured the same or similar to or include one or more of any of the features of any of the clamping mechanisms described with respect to U.S. Pat. No. 8,408,405, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference, or may include any of the features described herein. As will be described in more detail below, the clamping mechanism 162 can be configured to allow a user to adjust a position of the shelves 103 in addition to holding it in place on the first support member 102. The clamping mechanism 162 can be slidably mounted on the first support member 102 in the vertical or longitudinal direction and/or rotatably mounted about the longitudinal axis A1 of the first support member 102. As shown in FIG. 9, the clamping mechanism 162 can have a body 166, such as a portion that surrounds or fits around the entire or substantially the entire perimeter of the first support member 102. The clamping mechanism 162 be configured to couple to a bottom surface of a shelf 103. As described in more detail below, the shelf 103 can be adjusted, rotatably and/or vertically about the longitudinal axis A1 of the first support member 102, when the clamping mechanism 162 is loosened. When the clamping mechanism 162 is tightened, the shelf 103 is secured to the first support member 102 in a fixed position. Thus, the clamping mechanism 162 can be configured to hold the shelf 103 in place, even when the shelf 103 is loaded with the maximum design weight and/or in wet environments, such as a shower. In some implementations, the clamping mechanism 162 includes an outer clamp body 166 and clamp lever 164. The clamp body 166 can have an internal gasket, clamping plate, or clamping surface 168 that surrounds and/or engages a portion of, substantially the entire, or the entire outer surface or perimeter of the first support member 102. The internal surface 168 can be configured as a curved surface extending radially outward around the perimeter of the first support member 102. In certain variants, the clamp lever 164 can be rotatably mounted relative to the clamp body 166. The lever 164 can be configured to move between open (or unlocked) and closed (or locked) positions. For example, the lever 164 can be configured to secure the shelf 103 to the first support member 102 when the lever 164 is in the closed position and to allow the shelf 103 to be moved (e.g., vertically and/or rotatably) when the lever 164 is in the open position. In some embodiments, the clamp lever 164 can be formed of a translucent material, such as translucent polycarbonate. In some embodiments, the clamp lever 164 can be formed of a material comprising polyoxymethylene, such as Delrin®. In some variants, the clamp lever 164 is made of steel, stainless steel, aluminum, or plastic. In some embodiments, the lever 164 can include a cam 165 (which can be identical or similar to, or include one or more of the features of, the cams described is U.S. Pat. No. 8,408,405). In certain variants, the lever 164 has movement converting feature, such as an inwardly protruding surface 167 (e.g., a surface that extends generally towards the center of the first support member 102). The protruding surface 167 can be configured to convert the pivotal movement of the lever 164 into a translational movement and/or radially inward force of the cam 165 and/or inner surface 168 against the first support member 102 to secure the shelf 103 in position. For example, the lever 164 can be hinged or otherwise pivotally mounted relative to the clamp body 166, as shown in FIGS. 9 and 10. In some embodiments, the cam 165 can include at least a first portion having a radius R1 and a second portion with a radius R2, R2 being larger than R1. When the lever 164 is rotated such that the first portion is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member 102 and the protruding surface 167 is disengaged from the inner surface 168, the clamp device 162 is in the open position. In some variants, when the lever 164 is rotated such that the second portion is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member 102 and the protruding surface 167 is engaged and/or in contact with the inner surface 168, the clamp device 162 is in the closed position. These movements are described in greater detail below. In some embodiments, the cam 165 can include a third portion having a radius R3 which is larger than radius R2. As such, the cam 165 can be configured to provide an “over-center” operation. For example, with the radius R3 being larger than both the radiuses R1 and R2, the cam 165 will generate a maximum pressing force against the outer surface of the first support member 102 when the third portion is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member 102. This pressing force can be reduced as the lever 164 is further pivoted until the second portion is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member 102 and/or the protruding surface 167 is engaged with (e.g., abutted against) the inner surface 168. This can provide the user with a tactile signal that the lever 164 has been moved to the closed position. In some variants, the lever 164 is configured to move more rapidly during certain portions of its travel than in other portions of its travel. For example, the lever 164 can be configured to move rapidly from the intermediate position (e.g., in which the third portion is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member 102) to the closed position (e.g., in which the second portion is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member 102 and the protruding surface 167 is engaged and/or in contact with the inner surface 168). In some implementations, the lever 164 is configured to move between the intermediate and closed positions more rapidly (e.g., with less rotation and/or time) than it moves between the open and intermediate positions. FIGS. 9 and 10 show an example of the lever 164 in the closed position, which is when the clamping mechanism 162 is tightened to hold the shelf 103 in place. In this closed position, the clamping mechanism 162 is secured to the first support member 102 by the pressing force (e.g., radially inward force, friction force) generated by the cam 165 against the outer surface of the first support member 102, such as when the second portion is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member 102 and/or the protruding surface 167 is engaged and/or in contact with the inner surface 168. In certain embodiments, the inner surface 168 is configured to act as a stopping member to maintain the clamping mechanism 162 in the closed position (e.g., such that the lever 164 is in a generally vertical position or orientation and the second portion of the cam 165 is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member 102) and/or to inhibit the clamping mechanism 162 from over-rotating or rotating past the closed position. In some embodiments, the protruding surface 167 imparts a pressing force that pushes or presses against the inner surface 168, which, in turn, pushes or presses the inner surface 168 against an outer surface of the first support member 102. In various implementations, the magnitude of the pressing force is sufficient to support the shelf 103 at the desired location along and/or around the first support member 102 under a maximum load. In certain embodiments, the lever 164 can be moved to the open position by pulling or rotating it generally in the direction of an arrow A (e.g., in a direction generally away from the first support member 102). This can result in the cam 165 rotating in a counter-clockwise direction (as viewed in FIG. 10) and moving away from the inner surface 168 and/or outer surface of the first support member 102. In some variants, the first portion is moved into juxtaposition with the outer surface of the first support member 102. When the cam 165 (e.g., lever 164) moves away from the inner surface 168 and/or outer surface of the first support member 102, the pressing force (e.g., radially inward force, compression, etc.) can be reduced and/or eliminated. For example, the pressing force can be reduced when the second portion of the cam 165 moves out of juxtaposition with the outer surface of the first support member 102 and/or the protruding surface 167 disengages (e.g., moves out of contact with) the outer surface of the first support member 102. The reduction and/or elimination of the pressing force can remove the securement of the shelf 103, which can allow the shelf 103 to be adjusted vertically and/or rotatably. In some embodiments, when the lever 164 is in the open position, the first portion having the radius R1 is juxtaposed with the outer surface of the first support member 102 and/or the protruding surface 167 is disengaged (e.g., not in contact) with the inner surface 168 and/or the pressing force is decreased between the cam 165 and the outer surface of the first support member 102. This can enable the shelf 103 to be adjusted relative to the second support member 102, such as vertically and/or rotatably. Some embodiments include features to facilitate secure engagement between the clamping mechanism 162 and the first support member 102. For example, the clamping mechanism 162 can include a resilient member 169. As shown in FIG. 10, the resilient member 169 can be positioned on (e.g., abutted with) the outer surface of the first support member 102, such as on a side opposite the side the lever 164 is positioned on. In some variants, the resilient member 169 is positioned between the outer surface of the first support member 102 and an inner surface of the clamp body 166. The resilient or flexible material 169 may provide flex and/or increase friction between the clamping mechanism 162 and the first support member 102, such as in response to actuation or moving of the lever 164 and the cam 165. The resilient member 169 can be made of various resilient and/or flexible materials, such as rubber, rubber-like material, silicone-based material, plastic, or otherwise. In some embodiments, the resilient member 169 is formed (e.g., co-molded) with a portion of the clamp body 166. Certain Terminology Terms of orientation used herein, such as “top,” “bottom,” “horizontal,” “vertical,” “longitudinal,” “lateral,” and “end” are used in the context of the illustrated embodiment. However, the present disclosure should not be limited to the illustrated orientation. Indeed, other orientations are possible and are within the scope of this disclosure. Terms relating to circular shapes as used herein, such as diameter or radius, should be understood not to require perfect circular structures, but rather should be applied to any suitable structure with a cross-sectional region that can be measured from side-to-side. Terms relating to shapes generally, such as “circular” or “cylindrical” or “semi-circular” or “semi-cylindrical” or any related or similar terms, are not required to conform strictly to the mathematical definitions of circles or cylinders or other structures, but can encompass structures that are reasonably close approximations. Conditional language, such as “can,” “could,” “might,” or “may,” unless specifically stated otherwise, or otherwise understood within the context as used, is generally intended to convey that certain embodiments include or do not include, certain features, elements, and/or steps. Thus, such conditional language is not generally intended to imply that features, elements, and/or steps are in any way required for one or more embodiments. Conjunctive language, such as the phrase “at least one of X, Y, and Z,” unless specifically stated otherwise, is otherwise understood with the context as used in general to convey that an item, term, etc. may be either X, Y, or Z. Thus, such conjunctive language is not generally intended to imply that certain embodiments require the presence of at least one of X, at least one of Y, and at least one of Z. The terms “approximately,” “about,” and “substantially” as used herein represent an amount close to the stated amount that still performs a desired function or achieves a desired result. For example, in some embodiments, as the context may dictate, the terms “approximately”, “about”, and “substantially” may refer to an amount that is within less than or equal to 10% of the stated amount. The term “generally” as used herein represents a value, amount, or characteristic that predominantly includes or tends toward a particular value, amount, or characteristic. As an example, in certain embodiments, as the context may dictate, the term “generally parallel” can refer to something that departs from exactly parallel by less than or equal to 20 degrees. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, articles such as “a” or “an” should generally be interpreted to include one or more described items. Accordingly, phrases such as “a device configured to” are intended to include one or more recited devices. Such one or more recited devices can also be collectively configured to carry out the stated recitations. For example, “a processor configured to carry out recitations A, B, and C” can include a first processor configured to carry out recitation A working in conjunction with a second processor configured to carry out recitations B and C. The terms “comprising,” “including,” “having,” and the like are synonymous and are used inclusively, in an open-ended fashion, and do not exclude additional elements, features, acts, operations, and so forth. Likewise, the terms “some,” “certain,” and the like are synonymous and are used in an open-ended fashion. Also, the term “or” is used in its inclusive sense (and not in its exclusive sense) so that when used, for example, to connect a list of elements, the term “or” means one, some, or all of the elements in the list. Overall, the language of the claims is to be interpreted broadly based on the language employed in the claims. The language of the claims is not to be limited to the non-exclusive embodiments and examples that are illustrated and described in this disclosure, or that are discussed during the prosecution of the application. SUMMARY Although the shelving systems have been disclosed in the context of certain embodiments and examples, the shelving systems extend beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments to other alternative embodiments and/or uses of the embodiments and certain modifications and equivalents thereof. For example, although the illustrated embodiment of the shower caddy 100 has three shelves 103, the shower caddy 100 may have only one shelf, two shelves, more than three shelves, or as many shelves as will fit on the shelf assembly 101 (e.g., on first support member 102). Further, although the shower caddy 100 in the illustrated embodiment has shelves 103 having certain configurations (e.g., generally circular in shape), the shelves 103 may have different configurations, such as being generally square, rectangular, wedge-shaped, or otherwise. Also, although the illustrated embodiment has the first support member 102 extending through a center region of the shelf 103, the first support member 102 may extend through the shelf 103 in an off-center position (e.g., more proximate to a side, front, and/or back edge of the shelf 103). Various features and aspects of the disclosed embodiments can be combined with or substituted for one another in order to form varying modes of the conveyor. The scope of this disclosure should not be limited by the particular disclosed embodiments described herein.

Although features may be described above as acting in certain combinations, one or more features from a claimed combination can, in some cases, be excised from the combination, and the combination may be claimed as any subcombination or variation of any subcombination. Moreover, while operations may be depicted in the drawings or described in the specification in a particular order, such operations need not be performed in the particular order shown or in sequential order, and all operations need not be performed, to achieve the desirable results. Other operations that are not depicted or described can be incorporated in the example methods and processes. For example, one or more additional operations can be performed before, after, simultaneously, or between any of the described operations. Further, the operations may be rearranged or reordered in other implementations. Also, the separation of various system components in the implementations described above should not be understood as requiring such separation in all implementations, and it should be understood that the described components and systems can generally be integrated together in a single product or packaged into multiple products. Additionally, other implementations are within the scope of this disclosure. Some embodiments have been described in connection with the accompanying drawings. The figures are drawn to scale, but such scale should not be limiting, since dimensions and proportions other than what are shown are contemplated and are within the scope of the disclosed invention. Distances, angles, etc. are merely illustrative and do not necessarily bear an exact relationship to actual dimensions and layout of the devices illustrated. Components can be added, removed, and/or rearranged. Further, the disclosure herein of any particular feature, aspect, method, property, characteristic, quality, attribute, element, or the like in connection with various embodiments can be used in all other embodiments set forth herein. Additionally, any methods described herein may be practiced using any device suitable for performing the recited steps. In summary, various embodiments and examples of shelving systems have been disclosed. Although the shelving systems have been disclosed in the context of those embodiments and examples, this disclosure extends beyond the specifically disclosed embodiments to other alternative embodiments and/or other uses of the embodiments, as well as to certain modifications and equivalents thereof.
