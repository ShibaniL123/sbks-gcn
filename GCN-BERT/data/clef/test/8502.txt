FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of d-threo-ritalinic acid and its salts thereof. Particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of d-threo-ritalinic acid salts via its novel salts of intermediate thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The chemical name of dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride is (2R)-phenyl-[(2R)-piperidyl-2-yl-acetic acid methyl ester hydrochloride and it is also known as d-threo-enantiomer of methylphenidate hydrochloride. Methylphenidate hydrochloride is a mixture of dl-threo racemates and it is prescribed as psychostimulant. Dexmethylphenidate marketed as its hydrochloride salt, under the brand name “Focalin”. Subsequence study of methylphenidate hydrochloride revealed that its two enantiomers i.e. dl-threo methylphenidate hydrochloride and d-threo enantiomers are considered to be active disclosed in Biochemistry Pharmacology 1961, 8, 263-268. It is used in treatment of Attention Deficient Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Further, OPRD 2000, 4, 55-59 mentions that (R,R) enantiomer of methylphenidate (dexmethylphenidate) is about 5 to 38 times more active than its corresponding (S,S) enantiomer of methylphenidate. U.S. Pat. No. 2,957,880 discloses a process for preparing methylphenidate as a mixture of the erythro [R*, S*] and threo [R*, R*] racemates. Also discloses threo isomer of ritalinic acid prepared from the corresponding acid amide, in which resolution of amide using d-tartaric acid converted to (R,R)-ritalinic acid in three steps. Another several methods are reported for the resolution of dl-threo-methylphenidate by using expensive resolving agent like 1,1′-binaphthyl-2,2′-diyl hydrogen phosphate. Other resolving agents like O,O-diaroyltartaric acid or menthoxy-acetic acid or dibenzoyl-D-tartaric acid are disclosed in WO09727176, GB97/00643, U.S. Pat. No. 6,100,401, U.S. Pat. No. 6,121,453, U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,919 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,242,464 for the resolution of dl-threo-methylphenidate. Resolution of threo-methylphenidate may also be achieved by enzymatic hydrolysis methods proposed by Prashad (1998) [U.S. Pat. No. 7,247,730] and in WO98/25902. The main drawbacks of the above cited processes are resolution at the final stage may leads to poor enantiomeric purity and further need to be purified. The additional steps of purification may make the process expensive and tedious. In addition, the enzymatic hydrolysis is time consuming process and may affect the fast output of the product. U.S. Pat. No. 6,441,178 discloses the resolution of dl-threo-ritalinic acid salt. The resolution performed by treating dl-threo-ritalinic acid hydrochloride with (−)-1-phenylethylamine in large volume of ethanol gives only 77% ee diasteromeric salt enriched in d-threo-ritalinic acid. U.S. Pat. No. 7,247,730 discloses a process for the preparation of threo-N-Boc-ritalinic acid from the methylphenidate in three steps using crystalline sodium N-Boc-threo-ritalinate as precursor. US 2011/0130569 discloses a process for the preparation of the d-threo-ritalinic acid. dl-threo-ritalinic acid treated with (+)-dibenzoyl-D-tartaric acid as resolving agent in large volume of solvents mixture of methanol/water to get d-threo-ritalinic acid-dibenzoyl tartaric acid salt. Thus obtained salt treated with 35% hydrochloric acid in mixture of toluene and water, concentrated under vacuum and isolated by treating with acetone. The volume of resolution solvent used herein is quite higher. Hence, there is a need to provide an industrially viable process for the preparation of d-threo-ritalinic acid salt via its novel salts of intermediate avoiding large volume of solvents at resolution stage resulted in very good purity and yield which further helps in increasing the purity and yield of the final product i.e. dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride. OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION The principal objective of the present invention is to provide an efficient and industrially feasible process for preparation of d-threo-ritalinic acid and its salts thereof. Another main objective of the invention is to provide a process for preparation of d-threo-ritalinic acid and its salts thereof which circumvents the need of using large volume of solvents at the resolution stage. Another objective of the present invention is to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative. Still another objective of the invention is to provide a process for preparation of d-threo-ritalinic acid salt via its novel salts of intermediate thereof. Further objective of the invention is to provide an environment friendly process for the preparation of d-threo-ritalinic acid and its salts thereof. Further more objective of the present invention is to provide d-threo-ritalinic acid and its salts thereof having high purity and yield.

The present invention provides an efficient process for the preparation of d-threo-ritalinic acid salts. According to the embodiment of the invention provides an industrially viable process for preparation of d-threo-ritalinic acid salt starting from dl-threo-ritalinic acid. Stage 1: dl-Threo-ritalinic acid can be reacted with organic acid in suitable solvent to form an organic acid salt of dl-threo-ritalinic acid. Generally, the reaction involves organic acid salt formation of dl-threo-ritalinic acid by reacting dl-threo-ritalinic acid with organic acid in suitable solvents. Suitable solvent include, but are not limited to lower alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol and/or water and the like in any suitable proportion or any ratio. Organic acid include oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid and the like. The reaction mixture is stirred for 1 to 12 hours, preferably for 1-3 hours, more preferably till the completion of the reaction at reflux to ambient temperature, preferably at ambient temperature. The organic acid salt of dl-threo-ritalinic acid can optionally be isolated from the reaction mixture by suitable techniques such as filtration or centrifugation and the like. Dried the compound by the conventional techniques know in the art. The process resulted in desired compound in high purity and yield. Alternatively, formed organic acid salt of dl-threo-ritalinic acid can be carried forward to the next stage. Particularly, dl-threo-ritalinic acid is reacted with the organic acid such as oxalic acid in the mixture of alcohol and water, preferably methanol and water, more preferably in ratio of 1:0.88. The reaction mixture is stirred for about 1 hour at temperature about 25-30° C. After completion of the reaction, the same is filtered and distilled out at temperature 60-70° C. under the reduced pressure till the stirrable semisolid obtained. The ketonic solvent, preferably acetone is added in obtained residue and stirred for about 4 hours at temperature about 25-30° C. The precipitated oxalate salt of dl-threo-ritalinic acid is washed with acetone and the salt formation is confirmed by the elemental analysis. In another way, after treating dl-threo-ritalinic acid with organic acid such as oxalic acid in the mixture of alcohol and water, the reaction mixture can be taken for the next stage in-situ. Stage 2: The organic acid salt of dl-threo-ritalinic acid in isolated form or in-situ can be reacted with resolving agent in suitable solvent to form chiral acid salt of dl-threo-ritalinic acid. Generally, the reaction involves chiral acid salt formation of dl-threo-ritalinic acid by reacting organic acid salt of dl-threo-ritalinic acid with chiral acid in suitable solvent. Organic acid include oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid and the like. In another way, the reaction can be defined by a salt replacement or salt exchange. The process involves replacement of organic acid salt by chiral acid salt in reaction media. Suitable solvent include, but are not limited to lower alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol and/or water and the like in any suitable proportion or any ratio, preferably 20-30 times, more preferably 10-15 times, most preferably 5-10 times. Chiral acid include (+)-dibenzoyl-D-tartaric acid and the like. The reaction mixture is heated for 1 to 12 hours, preferably for 1-3 hours, more preferably at reflux to ambient temperature, most preferably at reflux temperature followed by cooling the reaction mixture. The precipitated chiral acid salt of d-threo-ritalinic acid can optionally be isolated from the reaction mixture by suitable techniques such as filtration or centrifugation and the like. Dried the compound by the conventional techniques know in the art. The confirmation of the desired chiral compound can be done by measuring specific optical rotation. The process resulted in desired compound in high purity and yield. In another aspect, the use of resolving agents such as (−)-dibenzoyl-L-tartaric acid persuade the desired compound in mother liquor. Particularly, organic acid salts such as oxalate salt of dl-threo-ritalinic acid in isolated form or in-situ can be reacted with the chiral acid such as (+)-dibenzoyl-D-tartaric acid in suitable solvent as described in above stage 1. The resulted reaction mixture is heated to reflux temperature and maintained for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is cooled to ambient temperature and stirred for 6-10 hours, preferably 8 hours. Further cooled to 5-10° C. and stirred for 1 hour. The material precipitated is (+)-dibenzoyl-D-tartaric acid salt of d-threo-ritalinic acid and the another part which is (+)-dibenzoyl-D-tartaric acid salt of 1-threo-ritalinic acid will remain in mother liquor. It is observed by the scientists of the present invention that the undesired compound (+)-dibenzoyl-D-tartaric acid salt of 1-threo-ritalinic acid and detached oxalic acid is having high solubility in alcohol:water. Hence that part remains in the mother liquor. The desired compound (+)-dibenzoyl-D-tartaric acid salt of d-threo-ritalinic acid filtered off and washed with methanol:water. One of the major attracting feature over the prior art is substantial reduction of solvent volume makes the process environment friendly, higher the productivity, higher the purity and yield. In another way, large volume of solvent needs big size reactor at the plant level for the reaction which also lowers the output of the product. Handling large volume of solvent is very difficult and tedious procedure. The present invention significantly reduces the volume of solvent gives outstanding output and handling ease at the plant level. It is known that solvent reduction can be increased the batch size which saves the manpower, time and energy consumption. Discarding of large volume of aqueous solvent can be hazardous to the environment and also needs lengthy procedure of effluent treatment in accordance with very high COD (Chemical oxygen demand). All the advantages cumulatively make the present invention plant friendly and cost-effective. For example comparison of the present invention process with US patent application 2011/0130569 A1 with respect to volume of solvent used is depicted in below table.
