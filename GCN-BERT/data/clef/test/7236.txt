The present invention describes transparent, aqueous surfactant-containing preparations comprising one or more crosslinked acrylate copolymers. Such preparations may also have suspended or stabilized particles. It has not been possible to date to provide transparent surfactant formulations with stabilized particles at a pH of 4.0 to 7.0, in particular a pH <6.4, which have suitable flow properties, are provided with a viscosity of ≧2000mPa·s and have a high foaming ability. Known formulations also have a proportion of anionic surfactant of >10%. Due to the high proportion of anionic surfactants, they have a poor mildness. It is now in particular desirable to provide preparations which, in addition to transparency, the suitable flow properties which enable a stable suspension of particles, droplets and/or bubbles and a largely acidic pH, are cosmetically advantageous preparations which are characterized by suitable mildness and care properties. Although systems using xanthan gum are already known from the prior art, these have cosmetic properties which can be improved with respect to skin feel during and after application. Moreover, only lower viscosities are reached at the same use concentration. To achieve advances in the field of stabilizing gel-like systems at the same time as improving the application properties, experiments were undertaken in which xanthan gum was replaced by polymeric structures. Crosslinked acrylate-based polymers proved to be particularly suitable. By using these polymeric structures, preparations could be provided which form a yield point. It is thereby possible to stabilize solid particles, droplets and bubbles in aqueous systems. These preparations thus obtained usually have a pH of ≧5.5. In preparations from the prior art which also lead to transparent preparations with yield point below a pH of 5.5, turbidity occurs on prolonged storage and the cosmetic consistency is unfavorable and in need of improvement. In the preparation of acrylate-based polymers, the choice of monomers, the ratio of the monomers to one another and the course of the polymerization reaction play an important role. The reaction course in particular influences the properties of the resulting products. The polymerization reaction can be carried out as follows: Firstly, monomers are treated with an initiator (ammonium peroxodisulfate for example) to start the reaction. After 30 minutes, crosslinker molecules are added and a further addition of monomer takes place. The reaction then proceeds for 4 hours. Variations in the reaction times are possible. The resulting products have a homogeneous composition. The monomers used are, for example: acidic vinyl monomers and/or salts thereof,nonionic vinyl monomers, preferably hydrophobic nonionic monomers,monomers comprising an unsaturated end group and a polyoxyalkylene moiety, andcrosslinking monomers. The preparation of homogeneous crosslinked acrylate-based copolymers is described below by way of example. These polymers are obtainable by free-radical emulsion polymerization of (A) at least one acidic vinyl monomer or salt thereof, (B) at least one nonionic vinyl monomer, particularly preferably a hydrophobic nonionic vinyl monomer, (C) at least one monomer comprising an unsaturated end group and a polyoxyalkylene moiety, (D) at least one crosslinking monomer, (E) optionally a protective colloid, characterized in that the polymerization is controlled such that (F) the gel effect occurs at least temporarily, achieved in that the monomer addition of the monomers (A), (B) and (C) (metering period) takes place over 120 minutes, preferably 60 minutes, particularly preferably 40 minutes, especially preferably 30 minutes and (G) the addition of the crosslinking monomer (D) begins at the earliest 10 minutes, preferably at the earliest 15 minutes after the first addition of the monomers (A), (B) and (C). In such a polymerization utilizing the Trommsdorff effect, i.e. at constant addition of the monomers and at the same time high addition rate of the monomers, a monomer excess forms which leads to autoacceleration of the polymerization (Trommsdorff effect). The result is an increase in the molecular weights at the same time as advantageous morphology of the polymers. It is advantageous here if the temperature during the polymerization is maintained between 70 and 90° C., preferably 80 and 90° C. It is further advantageous if the addition of initiator takes place both before starting the metering period and after addition of the crosslinking monomer. It is particularly preferable in this case if (H) associative monomers are absent or at most have a concentration of 15% by weight, preferably 10% by weight, particularly preferably 5% by weight, very particularly preferably 2.5% by weight, exceptionally preferably 1% by weight, particularly exceptionally preferably 0.1% by weight. It is particularly preferable if the acidic vinyl monomer (A) is selected from vinyl monomers having carboxyl groups, particularly preferably acrylic acid or methacrylic acid or alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium or alkylammonium salts thereof. It is particularly preferable if the nonionic vinyl monomer (B) is selected from the group of C1-C22 alkyl acrylates and the C1-C22 alkyl methacrylates and also mixtures thereof. Good flow properties and thus an advantageous rheological profile are thereby achieved. It is particularly preferable if the monomer (C), comprising an unsaturated end group and a polyoxyalkylene moiety, is selected from vinylpolyalkylene glycols or polymerizable surfactants or mixtures thereof, is particularly preferably selected from vinylpolyalkylene glycols or polymerizable surfactants or mixtures thereof, is preferably selected from ethoxylated and propoxylated 1,4-butanediol vinyl ether having 30 ethyleneoxy and propyleneoxy units, allylpolyethylene glycol ether having 30 ethyleneoxy units, allylpolyethylene glycol ether having 20 ethyleneoxy units, vinylpolyethylene glycol ether having 20 ethyleneoxy units, CH2=CHCH2O[(CH2CH2O)n(CH2(CH3)CHO)]mCH3 where m+n=5 to 100 and n/m=1, polyalkylene glycol allyl butyl ether having 25 ethyleneoxy and 8 propyleneoxy units, very particular preference being given to using Emulsogen R307 (EO/PO 30 1,4-butanediol vinyl ether (EO/PO 30 mol), Clariant), Emulsogen RAL307 (allylpolyalkylene glycol ether (EO 30 mol), Clariant), Polyglycol A11/1800 (allylpolyalkylene glycol ether (EO 20 mol, PO 20 mol), Clariant), Polyglycol R1100 (vinylpolyalkylene glycol ether (E0 20 mol), Clariant), Pluriol A111R (allyl alcohol alkoxylate, BASF) or Polyglycol AB25-8 (polyalkylene glycol allyl butyl ether (EO 25 mol, PO 8 mol), Clariant). Polyglycol A11/1800 has proven to be particularly useful and is therefore exceptionally preferred. It is particularly preferred if the crosslinking monomer (D) is selected from polyol(meth)acrylates with at least two (meth)acrylate groups and the mixed esters of polyols with acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid. It is further particularly preferred if the monomers (A) are present at contents of 10 to 75%, preferably 20 to 60%, particularly preferably 28 to 52%, very particularly preferably 32 to 52%, (B) are present at contents of 10 to 90%, preferably 30 to 80%, particularly preferably 40 to 62%, very particularly preferably 40 to 60%, (C) are present at contents of 0.5 to 40%, preferably 1 to 10%, particularly preferably 2 to 6%, (D) are present at contents of up to 1%, preferably 0.05 to 0.5%, particularly preferably 0.1 to 0.3%. It is very particularly preferred if the monomers (A):(B) are present in mass ratios of 1:2.2 to 1.5:1, preferably 1:1.6 to 1.3:1. It is very particularly preferred if the addition of the crosslinking monomer starts at the earliest after 10 minutes, particularly preferably after 15 minutes, and either ends immediately or lasts until the end of the metering period of the monomers.

The viscosity values, which are disclosed in the present specification, have been measured at 25° C. using the Rheomat R123 from the company ProRheo. When measuring using the Rheomat R123, the rotor of the device is immersed bubble-free into the sample up to the mark. For the measurements, measuring bob 1 was used. Further information regarding the Rheomat R123 is published on the internet, see http://www.prorheo.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pdfs/R123.pdf and http://www.prorheo.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pdfs/Bedienung_R123_d.pdf. The formulations have a tan delta of ≦0.5, by which a stabilization of particles is given. Tan delta is understood to mean the quotient of the loss modulus and the storage modulus. The tan delta is determined as follows: Loss and storage moduli are measured by a dynamic, shear-stress-controlled frequency test at a shear stress of 1 Pa on a shear-stress-controlled rheometer (SR series from Rheometric Scientific or AR series from TA instruments or other) at 40° C.±1° C. with 25 mm parallel plate geometry at a gap between 0.8 mm and 1.2 mm, charging being carried out in a structure-preserving manner. The frequency test is carried out according to the prior art with an appropriate structure recovery time before the test and the tan delta is quoted in the frequency range between 0.05 rad/s and 3.0 rad/s, preferably between 0.08 rad/s and 1.0 rad/s. The yield point is considered to be the critical shear stress of the flow curve. It may be determined in accordance with the invention as follows: The flow curve is measured on a shear-stress-controlled rheometer at 25° C.±1° C. with 20 mm parallel plate geometry at a gap between 0.8 mm and 1.2 mm, with charging being carried out in a structure-preserving manner A suitable constant shear stress gradient is predefined and, before the test, a corresponding structure recovery time is observed and the critical shear stress at the maximum of the flow curve is given. To determine the mildness, an RBC assay is carried out. The standard RBC assay (10 minutes incubation) serves to estimate the in vivo mucous membrane of the eye irritation potential of surfactants and surfactant-containing products. 1. Hemolysis A defined aliquot of isolated calf erythrocytes is incubated for 10 minutes with shaking at room temperature (RT) with a series of increasing concentrations of the WAS test samples to be investigated (stock solution with formulations 1:100 w/v or 0.1% active content in PBS for raw materials). After centrifugation, the resulting supernatants are analyzed photometrically at 530 nm for their liberated hemoglobin (HbO2) content. The relative degree of hemolysis is thereby calculated and the parameter H50 [μl/ml] is determined from the concentration-response curve. This indicates the concentration of the test samples at which 50% of hemoglobin is liberated. 2. HbO2 Denaturation A defined aliquot of isolated calf erythrocytes is incubated for 10 minutes with shaking at RT with a fixed concentration of test sample (1% w/v or 0.1% active content) and then centrifuged. The change in spectral absorption at 575 nm and 540 nm is measured compared to native HbO2. The denauration index DI [%] is calculated from the ratio of the absorption values to each other. Na lauryl sulfate serves as 100% standard (0.1% active content). 3. L/D Quotient The quotient is the ratio of the hemolysis parameters (H50) and denaturation (DI) and is used to characterize and classify the test samples investigated. Turbidity values are measured using a turbidity measuring device, wherein distilled water is used as standard with a value of NTU=0.

Since these preservatives exert their effect in an acidic pH range, a pH range which is advantageous for human skin (pH of human skin 5.4 to 5.9, in some areas of the skin even below pH=5.0) and is unfavorable for many bacteria, the use of these preservatives is of great advantage. Skincare Substances: It is advantageous to add substances to the preparations according to the invention which support skincare, which protect against dehydration of the skin, reduce irritation, which make the skin smoother and softer and improve the appearance of the skin. These include glycerol, panthenol, fatty acids having a chain length of C8 to C22, fatty alcohols having a chain length of C14 to C22, paraffin oils and also vegetable oils. Haircare Substances: In addition to the skincare substances described which also provide a degree of care to hair, which is reflected, inter alia, in improved stylability and a pleasant feel, silicones, cationic polymers and further haircare substances can also be added to the preparations according to the invention. pH Adjustment: The adjustment of the pH can be effected in the usual way in the cosmetic industry. However, preference is given to using citric acid and sodium hydroxide in order to adjust the required pH. Salts: The preparations according to the invention may also advantageously comprise salts. These salts are preferably inorganic salts. Alkali metal salts such as alkali metal halides, alkali metal sulfates, alkali metal nitrates and alkali metal phosphates are particularly advantageous. Complexing Agents: It is also optionally advantageous in accordance with the invention to add complexing agents to the preparations. Complexing agents are auxiliaries known per se in cosmetology or medical galenics. By complexing disrupting metals such as Mn, Fe, Cu and others, it is possible, for example, to prevent undesired chemical reactions in cosmetic or dermatological preparations. Complexing agents, particularly chelators, form complexes with metal atoms which, in the presence of one or more polybasic complexing agents, i.e. chelators, are metallacycles. Chelates are compounds in which a single ligand occupies more than one coordination site on a central atom. In this case, normally extended compounds are thus closed as a result of complex formation via a metal atom or a metal ion to form rings. The number of bonded ligands depends on the coordination number of the central metal. A prerequisite for formation of the chelate is that the compound reacting with the metal comprises two or more atomic groupings which act as electron donors. The complexing agent(s) can advantageously be selected from the group of customary compounds, preferably at least one substance from the group consisting of tartaric acid and anions thereof, citric acid and anions thereof, aminopolycarboxylic acids and anions thereof (such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and anions thereof, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) and anions thereof, hydroxyethylenediaminotriacetic acid (HOEDTA) and anions thereof, diethyleneaminopentaacetic acid (DPTA) and anions thereof, trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexanetetraacetic acid (CDTA) and anions thereof) and tetrasodium iminodisuccinate. According to the invention, the complexing agent(s) is/are advantageously present in cosmetic or dermatological preparations preferably in amounts of 0.01% by weight to 10% by weight, preferably 0.05% by weight to 5% by weight, particularly preferably 0.1-2.0% by weight, based on the total weight of the preparations. Particles: In the context of the present specification, particles are particles of all organic and inorganic solids on a natural and synthetic basis. Use is made, for example, of plastic particles of, for example, viscose, cellulose, polypropylene, polyester, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), aramid, nylon, kevlar, polyurethanes, polystyrene, cellulose esters and/or polyethylene and all other types of ground stone, ground plant constituents such as nut shells and kernels. Mixtures of different particles are also contemplated, which are pelleted by suitable physical processes, such as compression. Preference is given, for example, to Unispheres® from Induchem or Cosmospheres® from Pelletech. It is naturally known to the person skilled in the art that cosmetic preparations are in most cases inconceivable without the customary auxiliaries and additives. The cosmetic preparations according to the invention can accordingly also comprise cosmetic auxiliaries, as are customarily used in such preparations, for example, perfumes, substances for preventing foaming, dyes, pigments which have a coloring effect, emulsifiers, softening, antiinflammatory substances, insect repellants, antidandruff active ingredients, bactericides, viricides, salts, antimicrobially, proteolytically or keratolytically effective substances or other customary constituents of a cosmetic formulation such as foam stabilizers and electrolytes. By using AMA-X polymers, transparent formulations could be developed in a pH range of 4.0 to 7.0, preferably 4.0 to <6.4, particularly preferably 4.0 to ≦5.5. Transparent formulation signifies that the turbidity values are below 30 NTU, preferably below 25 NTU, particularly preferably below or equal to 20 NTU. These formulations have suitable flow properties, characterized by tan delta values which are preferably ≦0.5, such that solid particles, droplets and/or bubbles are stably suspended and also remain so. Since the content of anionic surfactants in the preparations according to the invention is below 10% and a combination of anionic surfactants with amphoteric, nonionic and/or cationic surfactants can be used, these preparations are characterized by their mildness. These formulations prepared in such a way have turbidity values <30 NTU, preferably <25 NTU, particularly preferably ≦20 NTU and a preferred tan delta ≦0.5. The use of haircare substances increases the mildness of these preparations still further. This is made clear by a comparative test (see examples, comparative test to determine mildness), in which a commercial product was compared with a preparation according to the invention with respect to mildness. The commercial product used is Balea Dusche & Ölperlen Queen of the Night, which preparation comprises Aqua SF2 from Lubrizol as structure-giving polymer. The preparation according to the invention achieves better values than the commercial product with respect to mildness, measured with the standard RBC test (WAS). The results are listed under examples in the comparative test to determine mildness. Since the preparations according to the invention are identified as mild preparations, said preparations are particularly suitable for achieving a reduction in irritation of the skin during the cleansing process, for cleansing sensitive, delicate and dry skin and for achieving a reduction of the drying out of hair and/or to be effective against the resulting brittle hair. Moreover, the preparations according to the invention are extremely satisfactory products with respect to the appearance of the products. No “polymer clouds” are visible such as in products which comprise Aqua SF2 (from Lubrizol) as structure-giving polymer, which can be observed under certain conditions. Likewise, no polymer precipitates can be seen in the preparations according to the invention. These polymer precipitates, which can be observed in products comprising Aqua SF2, lead to adhesion of product and/or polymer to the walls of the packaging. The preparations according to the invention are uniformly transparent preparations with exceptionally satisfactory flow behavior. The examples which follow illustrate the invention without limiting it.
