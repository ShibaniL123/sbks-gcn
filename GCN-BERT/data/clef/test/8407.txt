Step D: (R)-7-(benzylthio)-2-(1-(6-(2,2-difluoroethoxy)pyridin-3-yl)ethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline
DIPEA (5.54 ml, 31.7 mmol) was added to a solution of (R)-7-bromo-2-(1-(6-(2,2-difluoroethoxy)pyridin-3-yl)ethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (7.0 g, 15.86 mmol) in 1,4-Dioxane (70.8 ml). The mixture was evacuated and backfilled with N2 (3Ã—). tris(dibenzylidene-acetone)dipalladium(0) (0.363 g, 0.396 mmol), 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene (0.642 g, 1.110 mmol) and benzyl mercaptan (1.876 ml, 15.86 mmol) were added subsequently and the mixture was degassed 2 times. The mixture was heated to reflux for 2h. LC/MS showed the starting material was consumed. The reaction mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material was purified by ISCO (120 g column; 0-20% EtOAc/hex) to afford the title compound (7.217 g, 100% yield, 97% pure). Rf=0.20 (20% EtOAc/hex). LC/MS (m/z): 441 (M+H)+.
