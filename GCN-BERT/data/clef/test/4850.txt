IONIC LIQUID SOLVENT FOR ELECTROPLATING PROCESS RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to US provisional application 61/995,405 filed April 9, 2014. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT This invention was made with government support under the Department of Energy DE-FE0004000. The government has certain rights in this invention. BACKGROUND Metal electrodeposition, including aluminum electrodeposition, is an integral manufacturing step for a variety of applications including coatings and heat barrier layers. In the case of aluminum, for example, as aluminum itself is quite expensive, electroplating it onto cheaper materials allows for economical and corrosion-resistant plated metal. The current state of the art for aluminum deposition onto metal substrates typically employs electrolysis of aluminum trichloride (A1C13) in a toluene solution. This process is usually conducted at elevated temperatures (e.g., 80 °C), and toluene is both volatile and flammable. Under the conditions of the process, the solvent is above its flashpoint and as such represents a safety and environmental hazard. A method which makes use of a non-volatile, nonflammable solvent would be a major improvement to the process. For purposes herein, the terms "electrodeposition" and "electroplating" have the same meaning. Ionic liquids (ILs) provide an effective system for efficient and safe aluminum deposition (see, for example, Wilkes et al., Inorganic Chemistry, 1982, 21(3), 1263-1264; Abbott, et al., Application of ionic liquids to the electrodeposition of metals. Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP 2006, 8, 4265-79; Pomfret et al., Electrochemical Template Deposition of Aluminum Nanorods Using Ionic Liquids. Chemistry of Materials 2008, 20, 5945-5947; and Zhang et al., New electrolytes for aluminum production Ionic liquids. JOM 2003, 55, 54-57). More generally, see Electrodeposition from Ionic Liquids, (Eds. Endres, MacFarlane, and Abbott, Eds.), Wiley-VCH, 2008. ILs are most commonly defined as salts with melting points below 100 °C, and many ILs are liquid at room temperature. One ion has a delocalized charge and one component is organic, and this provides ILs with many unique properties such as negligible vapor pressure, low flammability, and low volatility to name a few. One can tune the properties of the IL, for example, by variation of the counterion structure and other methods. ILs also possess a wide electrochemical window. U.S. Patent Publication 2009/0236227 describes use of ionic liquids in electroplating or electropolishing. However, the description is not broad but is limited to ammonium embodiments. Also, the ionic liquid must either have a fatty alkyl chain or an N-acyl sulphonylimide type of anion. This again significantly limits the types of ionic liquids which can be used and types of improvements which can be made. Also, although the description mentions aluminum, no data or working examples are presented for aluminum deposition or electroplating. Finally, the process appears to require use of water during electrodeposition as water is always used in electrodeposition in the working examples. Aluminum cannot be electroplated in water. U.S. Patent Publication 2012/0006688 describes use of ionic liquids in electrochemical deposition of aluminum, but requires use of selected additives described as formulae (I), (II), and (III). Despite these advances, a need exists to develop better ionic liquid systems and methods for metal electrodeposition, and aluminum electrodeposition in particular. The methods should be more safe and provide high quality films. SUMMARY Embodiments described herein include methods of use, methods of making, and compositions.

In some embodiments described herein, the term "consisting essentially of can be used when the composition or method, or element thereof, excludes components or process steps, respectively, which materially affect basic and novel features of the invention. In other embodiments described herein, the term "consisting of can be used when the composition or method, or element thereof, excludes components or process steps, respectively. Examples of new ionic liquids (IL)s have been, described, synthesized, and characterized and represent a new class of next-generation ILs to be used in a variety of metal electrodeposition applications including, but not limited to, aluminum metal deposition onto a substrate. These ILs are non-flammable and provide smooth deposition of metallic aluminum onto an iron wire substrate. The newly synthesized ILs have been specifically designed for improved surface-interacting groups for smoother aluminum deposition properties. The substituent groups contain oxy-units which act as a viscosity reducer while also stabilizing the AIC * anion. This improvement is important in forming defect-free coatings on different substrates, and the electroplating results obtained by this method are demonstrated to be superior over other commercially available IL processes.

EXCLUSIONARY LIMITATIONS FOR THE CATION In some embodiments herein, the additives of formulae (I), (II), and (III) as described in US Patent Publication 2012/0006688 (Alemany et al.) and incorporated herein by reference are excluded. In particular, the processes described herein can be carried out without any of the following compounds represented by formulae (I), (II), or (III) as additives in the ionic liquid: where X and X are each, independently of one another, N or CH, X3 is NR'A or S, m is an integer from 0 to 4, where at least two of X1, X2 and X3 are heteroatoms selected from among N, 0 and S, and R1 is selected from the group consisting of H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl and heterocyclyl, where the alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl and heterocyclyl groups are optionally substituted by one or more substituents and the alkyl and cycloalkyl groups are optionally interrupted by from 1 to 3 heteroatoms or functional groups, and the radicals R2 are each, independently of one another, H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl or heterocyclyl, where the alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl and heterocyclyl groups are optionally substituted by one or more substituents and the alkyl and cycloalkyl groups are optionally interrupted by from 1 to 3 heteroatoms or functional groups; and wherein the additive of the general formula (II) is a compound of the general formula (Π), R CR^Hal- (II) where R3 is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl or heterocyclyl, where the alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl and heterocyclyl groups are optionally substituted by one or more substituents and the alkyl and cycloalkyl groups are optionally interrupted by from 1 to 3 heteroatoms or functional groups, and the radicals R4 are each, independently of one another, H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl or heterocyclyl, where the alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl and heterocyclyl groups are optionally substituted by one or more substituents and the alkyl and cycloalkyl groups are optionally interrupted by from 1 to 3 heteroatoms or functional groups, and Hal is selected from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine; and wherein the additive of the general formula (III) is a compound of the general formula (in), R5S03."M+ (III) where R5 is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl or heterocyclyl, where the alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl and heterocyclyl groups are optionally substituted by one or more substituents and the alkyl and cycloalkyl groups are optionally interrupted by from 1 to 3 heteroatoms or by functional groups, and M+ is Na+ or K+. In other embodiments, the process is carried out without any organic additives in the ionic liquid. In another embodiment, the process is carried out without any additives in the ionic liquid. The amount of an additive in a composition usually is relatively small. In US 2012/0006688, the amount of the additive is said to be 0.1 to 10% by weight based on the total amount of ionic liquid. In addition, in one embodiment, the cation does not comprise substituents as described in US Patent Publication 2009/0236227, which is incorporated by reference, in particular a saturated or unsaturated alkyl chain having 8 to 22 carbon atoms or a fatty alkyl chain. In one embodiment, the ionic liquid cation is not an ammonium cation. In one embodiment, the cation of the ionic liquid is free of substituents which are longer chain alkyl groups (e.g., C6 and higher) and also free of aromatic substituents (e.g., benzyl). IONIC LIQUID ANION The use of various anions in ionic liquids is generally known in the art. See, for example, Electrodeposition from Ionic Liquids, (Eds. Endres, MacFarlane, and Abbott, Eds.), Wiley- VCH, 2008. In one embodiment, the anion is a halide such as F, CI, Br, or I. In another embodiment, the anion is, for example, PF6", BF4", CF3SO3" (trifluoromethanesulfonate), [(CF3S02)2N'] [bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide], and [(CF3S02)3C] [tris(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)methide]. So-called hydrophobic anions can be used. EXCLUSIONARY LIMITATIONS FOR THE ANION In one embodiment, anions as described in US Patent Publication 2009/0236227, which is incorporated by reference, are excluded. For example, in one embodiment, the anion does not have an N-acylsulfonylimide anion functionality. Numerous compounds have such a functionality. An example of such a moiety described in the 2009/0236227 US Patent Publication is the saccharinate anion. More generally, N-acylsulfonylimide moieties can be represented by Ra-C(0)N"S(0)2-Rb, wherein Ra and Rb can be any moieties which can be synthesized including situations wherein Ra and Rb form a ring such as an aromoatic ring or a non-aromatic ring. An example of an aromatic ring is a benzene ring, as in saccharinate, and an example of a non-aromatic ring can be found in the acesulfamate anion, also described in US Patent Publication 2009/0236227. SYNTHESIS OF IONIC LIQUID The synthesis of various ionic liquids is generally known in the art. The methods and examples described herein can be extended to other systems by the person skilled in the art. See, for example, Electrodeposition from Ionic Liquids, (Eds. Endres, MacFarlane, and Abbott, Eds.), Wiley-VCH, 2008. In one embodiment, the substituent with the oxy unit S is prepared as a precursor having a functional group which is adapted to react with another moiety to form the ionic liquid. For example, a halo compound can be prepared having the oxy unit, which is reacted with an amine or nitrogen-containing compound in a quatemization reaction to form the ionic liquid having the substituent S. In one example, an ionic liquid containing a pyrrolidinium-based cation was synthesized according to Scheme 1 below, and the intermediate product and the ionic liquid were characterized by lH NMR spectroscopy (Figure 2 and Figure 3 of priority provisional application 61 995,405). In another example, an ionic liquid containing a triazolium-based cation, shown below as IL-1 compound, was synthesized and the ionic liquid was characterized by Ή NMR spectroscopy (Figure 4 of priority provisional application 61/995,405). Scheme 1 A. SOCI2, pyridine 1 -chloro-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethane B. Scheme 1 illustrates a 2- step synthetic route for example pyrrolidinium-based ionic liquids. The methods can be adapted to provide the synthesis of the following ionic liquid (IL- (IL-1) AMOUNTS The amounts and concentrations of the different components of the process can be varied as known in the art. For example, the molar ratio of the ionic liquid to an anion such as chloride can be adapted. For example, if an ionic liquid is mixed with a moiety such as aluminum trichloride, the ratio of the two, respectively, can be 1 :2 to 2: 1 or 1.5: 1 to 1 : 1.5, or about 1 :1. See, for example, the working example, provided hereinafter. ELECTROPLATING Electroplating and electrodeposition methods, including deposition of aluminum, are generally known in the art. See, for example, Electrodeposition from Ionic Liquids, (Eds. Endres, MacFarlane, and Abbott, Eds.), Wiley- VCH, 2008 including Chapters 4 and 12 and description for electrodeposition of aluminum. See also PhD thesis of E.M. Moustafa, 2007, Clausthal University of Technology ("Electroplating of Aluminum in Different Air and Water Stable Ionic Liquids"). Electroplating of aluminum is known to be a valid alternative for aluminum deposition compared to other methods such as hot dipping, thermal spraying, sputter deposition, and vapor deposition. In some cases, the ionic liquid might form a biphasic medium for deposition. In some case, microcrystalline or nanocrystalline metal, such as aluminum metal, may form in electrodeposition. METAL Metals which can be used in electroplating are known in the art. Transition metals can be used. Examples of metals (in no particular order) include, for example, Al, In, Ga, Zn, Mg, Ti, Zr, Mn, Cu, Zn, Ta, Si, Se, Cr, Ni, Au, Ag, Pt, and Rh. Group III metals can be used. A preferred example is aluminum. Mixtures of metals and metal alloys can also be electroplated. Examples of alloys include aluminum alloys such as, for example, Al-Mg, Al-Mn, and Al-Cr. METAL SALT AND METAL SOURCE In some embodiments, a metal salt which is added to or used in the ionic liquid is the metal source or a metal electrode is employed as the metal source. In one embodiment, a metal salt added to or used in the ionic liquid is employed as the metal source. In another embodiment, a metal electrode is employed as the metal source. In one embodiment, the metal salt is an aluminum salt. In one embodiment, the metal salt is an aluminum halide salt. Use of metal salts in electroplating are known in the art including use of aluminum salts such as haloaluminum salts derived from such as AICI3, Al(ethyl)Cl2, or AlBr3. ELECTROPLATING CONDITIONS Electroplating conditions such as temperature, potential, time, purification of reagents and ionic liquids, and the like known in the art can be used. Temperatures known in the art can be used for electroplating. In one embodiment, for example, the metal, such as aluminum, is deposited at a temperature of 25°C to 150°C, or more preferably, 50°C to 100°C, or more preferably from 80°C to 100°C, or more preferably 85°C to 95°C. Potentials known in the art for electroplating can be used, and the potential can be varied for the metal and the particular process. In one embodiment, the metal such as aluminum is deposited at a potential of about 0.7 V to 0.9 V. In some cases, organic solvent can be used with the ionic liquid, and in other cases, organic solvent is not used with the ionic liquid. In one embodiment, in particular, the process is carried out without flammable solvent, such as for example organic solvent, such as for example aromatic solvent, such as for example benzene or toluene. The substrate which is coated is not particularly limited but can be, for example, steel, Fe, Cu, Ni, Pt, Cu, glassy carbon, and the like. The substrate can serve as the cathode, whereas the deposited metal such as aluminum can serve as the anode. The thickness of the deposit is not particularly limited but can be adapted to the context and can be, for example, 0.5 microns to 500 microns, or 1 micron to 250 microns, or 5 microns to 100 microns. Dense, adherent, uniform layers of metal, including aluminum layers, can be formed. ANHYDROUS CONDITIONS In some embodiment, the use of water in the ionic liquid during electrodeposition is avoided such that the conditions are anhydrous. For example, liquid components can be dried and inert gaseous materials (e.g. nitrogen) can be used which have water vapor excluded. For example, the amount of water in the ionic liquid can be, for example, less than 1 wt.%, or less than 0.5 wt.%, or less than 0.1 wt.%, or less than 0.01 wt.%. Water can still be used in conventions steps before or after electrodeposition such as, for example, washing an electrode or washing a deposited metal. APPLICATIONS Example applications of this new method for use of ionic liquids include, but are not limited to, metal deposition (aluminum electroplating) and electrochemical applications in lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors. These examples also open up additional applications for replacing cytotoxic chromium in metal coatings with aluminum using these improved ILs. The IL solvents have been demonstrated and described in accordance with several examples, which are intended to be illustrative in all aspects rather than restrictive. Thus, the present invention is capable of many variations in detailed implementation, which may be derived from the description contained herein by a person of ordinary skill in the art. WORKING EXAMPLES Additional embodiments are provided in the following non-limiting working examples. Experimental Methods Synthesis of l-chloro-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethane (Scheme 1 A). Commercially available 2- (2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol (4.9 mL, 0.042 mol) was added by syringe to a round-bottom flask containing 100 mL of chloroform. Following this, 1.2 equivalents of pyridine (4 mL, 0.050 mol) was added to the solution by syringe. The round bottom flask was cooled to 0 °C using an ice bath and thionyl chloride (3.6 mL, 0.050 mol) was added dropwise by syringe. Following the addition, the ice bath was removed and an oil bath was used to heat the reaction mixture at reflux for 12 hrs. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and transferred to a separatory funnel. Water was added, and an organic phase was separated and washed with 1 N HC1 solution in water and dried with sodium sulfate. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. Distillation of the crude product at 50 °C yielded the desired l-chloro-2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethane in 90 % yield (5.19 g). Synthesis of pyrrolidinium-based IL (Scheme IB). A 250 mL flame dried Schlenk flask was charged with dry acetonitrile (150 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere. N-methylpyrrolidine (8.5 g, 10.4 mL, 0.1 mol) was added to the reaction flask by syringe, and 1.3 equivalents of 1- chloro-2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethane (18 g, 0.13 mol) was weighed out in a syringe and added to the reaction mixture. Once both reagents were added to the acetonitrile solution, the reaction vessel was placed in an oil bath and heated under reflux for 48 h. After 48 h, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The desired ionic liquid was obtained in 99% yield (21.1 g). Electrodeposition process. The ionic liquid was then introduced to A1C13 for electrodeposition onto an iron wire electrode, and the electrodeposition was also compared to results from a commercial process using l-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [EMIM]C1 containing AICI3. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed to measure the deposition potential for the new IL system described herein and the EMIM commercial system, and the results are illustrated in Figure 1. In this example, the working electrode is Fe wire, Al wire was used as the counter and reference electrodes; scanning rate = 50 mV/s. The results demonstrate that each IL system has a deposition potential of 0.8-1 V. The aluminum deposition was also characterized by scanning electron microscopy and the results are illustrated in Figure 2. Indeed, the stabilization of the system to enhance smooth and defect-free coatings on the iron substrate can be visualized by comparing the new ionic liquid deposition (B) to that of the EMIM commercial system (C). The -oxy unit in the example ionic liquids acts as a viscosity reducer and also stabilized the A1C14". This improvement is important in forming defect free coatings on different substrates and as observed the coatings obtained by this method are smoother in appearance. A three-electrode system was utilized: aluminum wire was used as the counter and reference electrodes, iron wire was used as the working electrode. Standard pre-treatment procedures were as follows: all electrodes were polished using sand paper and cleaned using tissues; the electrodes were then degreased in acetone under ultrasonic conditions for 15 min; and finally, the electrode surface was activated chemically in 5 wt.% HC1 for 2 min to remove oxide layers. The electrodes were then rinsed thoroughly using deionized water prior to use. A 20 mL scintillation vial was flame dried and brought into a glovebox under nitrogen atmosphere. The scintillation vial was charged with 9.35 g (0.042 mol) of the ionic liquid. Then, AICI3 (5.57 g, 0.042 mol) was weighed into the vial slowly as this process is exothermic. The vial was fitted with a screwtop cap that contained all three electrodes, and the vial was removed from the glovebox. The electrodes were connected to a power source, and a flow of nitrogen was connected to the vial. The vial was placed in an oil bath with a temperature between 85-95 °C, and 0.8 V potential was applied for 20 min. 1.
