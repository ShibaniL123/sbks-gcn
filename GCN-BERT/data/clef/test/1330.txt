FIELD Embodiments of the present invention relate to devices, instruments, and associated methods for treating joint pain, and more particularly, knee pain. BACKGROUND Knee arthritis affects millions of people and the pain associated with this disease can be disabling. Patients who initially present with painful knee arthritis are usually treated non-surgically. Non-surgical treatments are modestly effective at temporarily relieving pain, but are not risk free. Pharmacologic intervention (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) has been reported to be associated with significant complications, such as gastric ulcers, strokes and heart attacks. A steroid or viscosupplement injection may lead to infection. Steroid injections may also have systemic effects, such as increased blood sugar and hypertension. Generally speaking, non-surgical interventions are most efficacious for early arthritic disease and do not prevent disease progression. When non-surgical treatment proves ineffective, surgical intervention is often recommended. Arthroscopic surgery has been shown to have limited effectiveness and has a small role in the management of knee arthritis. More invasive surgical approaches such as high tibial osteotomy and partial or complete knee replacement predictably relieve pain. These major operations, however, are also potentially associated with significant morbidity and occasional mortality. These risks, along with the limited durability of implantable devices, cause patients and physicians to defer surgery until the symptoms become unbearable. Some research has determined that glutamate transporters and receptors are highly expressed in subchondral proximal tibial bone in patients with osteoarthritis. The degree of expression of these transporters and receptors is directly proportional to the severity of the disease. Further, the increased expression occurs in the subchondral bone adjacent to the arthritic lesion. Thus, subchondral bone is likely an important source of pain management of osteoarthritis. See, “Expression of Glutamate Receptors and Transporters in Human Subchondral Bone in Osteoarthritis” by Christopher Wilson (Oct. 13, 2009). Accordingly, it is desired to provide an effective, surgical treatment of osteoarthritis, and particularly knee arthritis pain. It is further desired that such surgical treatment be less invasive than high tibial osteotomy and partial or complete knee replacement. SUMMARY The present disclosure provides devices, instruments, and associated methods for treating joint pain. In particular, the joint is evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging to detect any anomalies in the subchondral bone. For example, using T2-weighted MRI images, bone marrow lesions or edemas can be identified, and using T1-weighted MRI images, associated regions of sclerotic bone adjacent to the bone marrow lesion can be identified. This condition may be the result of several factors, such as early arthritis, that results in an uneven concentration of loads in a joint. The uneven loads may cause a region of the bone to harden and become sclerotic, which can further aggravate the uneven load distribution. As a result, the sclerotic bone and uneven load may cause insufficiency fractures or fissures that appear as a bone marrow lesion or edema. In one embodiment, the subchondral region of the bone is evaluated for the presence of one or more bone marrow lesions and a region of sclerotic bone. If these indications are found, then a SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ treatment may be employed to treat the joint pain. The method may involve introducing a bone void filler material at the site to address the bone marrow lesion or edema, and/or drilling and inserting an implant to address the sclerotic bone. This treatment may thus serve to reintegrate the bone and equalize load distribution to thereby relieve pain. In one embodiment, a method for treating joint pain comprises: identifying a source of the pain of the joint based on an image of the joint, the image indicating the presence of a defect in the subchondral region of a bone of the joint; locating an insufficiency fracture in the subchondral region of the joint; mapping an access path to a location in the subchondral region where the insufficiency fracture resides, wherein the access path preserves an articular surface of the joint; and implanting in the bone, via the access path, a reinforcing member that stabilizes the insufficiency fracture. In another embodiment, an instrument for guiding a tool to a target location in a bone adjacent to a joint comprises: a first portion having a first guide section configured to guide the tool to the target location; a reference probe extending from the first portion having a tip that indicates a selected landmark on the bone; and a handle portion coupled to the first portion and having a second guide section configured to guide a tool to the target location. The first guide section is configured to guide the tool at an angle substantially parallel to the reference probe, and the second guide section is configured to guide the tool at an angle acute to the reference probe. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the disclosure. Additional features of the disclosure will be set forth in part in the description which follows or may be learned by practice of the disclosure.

DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS In general, the embodiments relate to devices, instruments and associated methods for treating joint pain in the subchondral region of the bone. One embodiment involves identifying defects in the subchondral region of a bone, such as a bone marrow lesion or edema adjacent to the joint, where sclerotic bone is also present, and then treating the defects such as by implanting an implant, such as a reinforcing member, in or adjacent to the abnormality or bone marrow lesion. Another treatment may involve the introduction of bone void material. In some embodiments, bone marrow lesions are considered an indicator of overstressed bone. In general, a bone marrow lesion may be any abnormal area or fracture in the bone. That is, any fracture non-union having a pathology indicating an amorphous structure with osseous and fibrous elements may be treatable by embodiments of the present invention. Overstressed bone sustains more damage than repair and this often results in pain to a patient. Bone is continuously fatigued and damaged by everyday activity. However, bone is a living tissue that is capable of repairing itself. Certain pathological processes, such as loss of joint cartilage or joint deformation, can disturb the natural repair processes of healthy bone. Embodiments of the invention may enhance the strength of bone and provide shielding to the subchondral region of the bone to prevent or minimize excessive stress using a subchondral surgical treatment marketed under the trademark SUBCHONDROPLASTY™. SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ treatment may be useful for treating joint pain, such as knee pain, where sclerotic bone and an associated anomaly or defect such as bone marrow lesion or edema is found. In some embodiments, bone marrow lesions or insufficiency fractures may be treated by SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ using an open reduction, internal fixation of the bone's abnormal area or area adjacent to the abnormality. In particular, in SUBCHONDROPLASTY™, the sclerotic bone may be treated using drilling and insertion of an implant. In addition, an associated bone marrow lesion or edema may be treated by injection of a bone void filler, such as a calcium phosphate cement (CPC). Based on the implant and surgical method, a subchondral region of the bone may be treated and strengthened to restore its strength/repair equilibrium. In addition, strengthening the bone reduces, reverses and/or prevents the deformation of overstressed bone, which may relieve pain and slow arthritic disease progression within the underlying bone and adjacent meniscal tissues, such as cartilage. In some embodiments, the invention provides an additional treatment option for patients suffering with arthritic pain, particularly in the knee. The method of the invention may be performed based on minor or outpatient surgery. Thus, the risk of complications is expected to be significantly less than with major arthritis surgery, such as more invasive procedures like high tibial osteotomy and partial or total knee replacement. In some embodiments, the implant and methods stabilize the defect in the subchondral (underlying) bone in order to prevent further biomechanical breakdown of the subchondral region of the bone and of the adjacent meniscal tissues, and alleviate the corresponding pain in the joint. For example, the devices and methods of the present invention may promote integration of the bone marrow lesion with the surrounding bone. In other words, the implant and methods may serve to bridge the surrounding bone having one or more bone marrow lesions or bone insufficiency fractures. The surrounding region may even be dense sclerotic bone. In some embodiments, the implant may serve to redistribute the stress within the bone (especially in a weight bearing bone), and thus, may reduce pain. In other words, the implant may essentially dampen or prevent the force transmission that causes pain from the subchondral region of the bone. The implant is designed to have optimal stiffness and may be bioactive to facilitate the healing processes of the bone and integration of any abnormal areas, such as bone marrow lesions or insufficiency fractures, within the bone. In a joint having a subchondral area of thinned or damaged bone, or an area absent of cartilage, there often exists nearby defects such as insufficiency fractures or fissures. Along with an insufficiency fracture there is often a region of dense sclerotic bone, possibly created by the concentration of joint forces at this localized region. It is believed that, over time, the joint forces acting on this dense sclerotic bone creates abnormal distribution of forces that lead to anomalies such as bone marrow lesions or edemas. The sclerotic bone region can be identified using T1-weighted MRI, while the bone marrow lesion or edema can often be identified using T2-weighted MRI. As noted, embodiments of the present invention may be explained and illustrated with reference to treatment of a patient's knee, though it is understood that the devices, instruments and methods of the present invention may be applicable to other joints as well, such as the shoulder, hip and ankle. Referring now to FIG. 1, an arthritic human knee comprises a femur 10 and a tibia 12. Bone lesion 14 of tibia 12 presents as a focally increased signal in the marrow in an MRI of the knee. In certain embodiments, coronal spin-echo fat-saturated proton density, T1p proteoglycan and T2-weighted fat-saturated magnetic resonance images are preferred. In some embodiments, bone lesions, which are from 0 to 10 cm from the joint, 0 to 5 cm from the joint, or 0 to 1 cm from the joint are considered good candidates for treatment. A bone marrow lesion 14 or other abnormality causing pain can be identified using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), such as a T2-weighted MRI, but other identification means may be employed as well. For example, bone lesions can be identified using X-ray or Technetium-99 bone scans. In embodiments employing MRI, any MRI technology that reveals bone marrow lesions can be used, for example, open MRI, low field strength MRI, extremity MRI, whole body scanner MRI, and the like. In another embodiment, 3-dimensional imaging or image guidance technology may be employed to locate the lesion or defect. Such imaging technology would enable the lesion or defect to be located intraoperatively. Various criteria may be employed for selecting an implant in accordance with principles of the present invention. For example, a reinforcing member 16 as an implant may be selected based on a grading system that indicates an extent of treatment for various types and sizes of bone marrow lesions or defects. FIG. 1 shows just one example of how reinforcing member 16 could be implanted in bone lesion 14. Of course, the reinforcing member 16 may be implanted adjacent to the bone lesion 14. For example, the reinforcing member 16 can be implanted adjacent to a side of the bone lesion proximal to the joint and/or adjacent to a side of the bone lesion distal to the joint. FIG. 1 shows one reinforcing member 16 implanted. Those skilled in the art will recognize that multiple reinforcing members can be implanted in and/or adjacent to a bone lesion according to other embodiments. In general, an implant that is 10 mm (or less) away from an outer surface of the bone lesion can be considered adjacent to that lesion. Adjacent reinforcing members can also be in contact with an outer surface of the bone lesion. In general, the reinforcing member 16 serves to adequately distribute stresses placed on the bone. The reinforcing member 16 may be bioactive and configured to have an appropriate rigidity/flexibility and other characteristics, such as porous or non-porous coatings, as desired. In particular, the reinforcing member 16 may be sufficiently strong or stiff to make it capable of being implanted in bone and avoid stress concentration, for example, in the subchondral region of the bone. Accordingly, the reinforcing member 16 may have various dimensions and stiffness. In some embodiments, the implant is implanted free of bonds to the bone. Thus, the reinforcing member is not, for example, glued, cemented, stapled, stitched, clamped or screwed to the bone. However, the implant may naturally or be configured to eventually bond to the bone via biological processes in situ. In some embodiments, the reinforcing member 16 is implanted in the bone in or adjacent the bone lesion such that a proximal face faces the joint and a distal face faces away from the joint. In addition, the reinforcing member 16 may be selected or modified (e.g., cut, tom, etc.) such that a maximum dimension of the proximal face exceeds a maximum dimension of the bone lesion. It is also within the scope of the invention for the maximum dimension of the bone lesion to equal or exceed a maximum dimension of the proximal face. Thus, the reinforcing member 16 can be larger, smaller or the same size as the bone lesion. The reinforcing member 16 can be implanted such that the proximal face is perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the bone. In general, proximal and/or distal faces of the implant will be the primary load bearing surfaces in situ. In certain embodiments, a syringe (optionally with a needle) can be used to inject a fluid into a bone so as to form the reinforcing member in situ. This step can be conducted with or without first creating an opening in the bone. The fluid is preferably a liquid, semi-solid, gel, hydrogel, dispersion or slurry. After injection, the fluid can remain fluid-like, or may cure to a more solid-like state. For example, the injected fluid can cross-link or polymerize from a liquid to form a semi-solid, gel or solid. Fluids that cure in situ can be self-curing or can cure in response to curing means, such as, e.g., radiation (e.g., UV light), heat (e.g., body temperature), moisture and/or a curing agent. In other embodiments, the reinforcing member is solid in nature and may be rigid or malleable. In these embodiments, the surgeon creates a small opening in the vicinity of the bone lesion. Suitable surgical tools for this task include standard bone instruments (e.g., chisels, drills, etc.) and instruments, such as a guide/insertion instrument, designed for use in the method of the invention. A surgeon can implant the reinforcing member 16 by studying a previously captured image of the bone marrow lesion 14 and manually estimating the location and boundaries of the bone lesion. Alternatively, a surgeon can be provided with additional guidance during surgery. For example, surgery can be conducted using real-time imaging, robotic devices, one or more braces that maintain the joint in a position consistent with captured images of the joint and/or labels, etc. Suitable labels include but are not limited to radioactive labels, such as Technetium-99 and other objects, such as fiducial markers. Postoperatively, patients may be required to maintain partial weight bearing and use ambulatory aids. Depending upon the physician's discretion, full weight bearing may also be possible after surgery. Routine post intervention physical therapy may also be required. Patients may be treated according to routine post intervention care, observation and follow-up. The reinforcing member 16 may have various forms and shapes to maximize its surface area and reduce stress of the bone when implanted. For example, the reinforcing member 16 may be in the form of a rod having a triangular profile, a rectangular profile, or a circular profile. Reinforcing member 16 may be planar, e.g., relatively long in two dimensions and relatively short in a third dimension. Planar reinforcing members in accordance with the invention can have a thickness which is ≦50% of the length and ≦50% of the width of a rectangular reinforcing member (or ≦50% of the diameter in the case of a circular reinforcing member or ≦50% of the height and ≦50% of the base in the case of a triangular reinforcing member). In other embodiments, the reinforcing member 16 may have a wedge-shaped edge on at least one edge or a wedge or ramp shape when viewed from the side. A wedge-shaped edge may be adapted to facilitate inserting the reinforcing member 16 into the bone. Thus, the particular angle and other dimensions of the wedge may be dictated by factors that are known in the art. As a wedge-shaped implant, the reinforcing member 16 may be similar to standard surgical tools, such as osteotomes, or comprise blade plates or osteotomy staples. Further, the reinforcing member 16 may be an expandable device that can span the defect. In one embodiment, the reinforcing member 16 may be an expandable screw, such as an osseoscrew. In other embodiments, the reinforcing member 16 may be in the form of a dosed disc, an open disc, a screw-shaped device, or an elongated pin. In addition, the reinforcing member 16 may have a square profile, rectangular profile with rounded edges, or an I-beam profile. Alternatively, the reinforcing member 16 can be an injection cement diffuser. In some embodiments, the reinforcing member 16 may be approximately 3 mm thick. In some embodiments, the reinforcing member 16 may be customized to the patient. For example, using 3-dimensional imaging technology, it may be desirable to provide an implant that matches precisely the anatomical site where the reinforcing member 16 is to be placed. This would ensure conformability and avoid a less than perfect match between the implant and the implantation site. The reinforcing member 16 may be porous and/or fenestrated to allow for bone ingrowth. Reinforcing member 16 comprises a physiologically compatible material that has sufficient durability to reinforce the overstressed bone of the bone lesion and bear physiologic loads. Materials for the reinforcing member 16 can include metals, such as titanium, stainless steel, alloys of cobalt and chrome, tantalum, alloys of titanium and nickel and other superelastic metal alloys. Porous, titanium, titanium “foam”, tantalum, trabecular metals, nanoceramics, porous nitinol, or other highly porous nanomaterials, and chrome cobalt may also be employed in the reinforcing member 16. The reinforcing member 16 may comprise a functional coating, such as, hydroxyapatite plasma coating, titanium nitrate or bioactive glass. In addition, the reinforcing member 16 may undergo some form of surface treatment including acid etching, grit blast, or plasma spray. The reinforcing member may also comprise structural enhancements such as meshes, and include autograft. The member 16 may also be formed of, or include, porous metals like tantalum or ACTIPORE™. Other embodiments comprise the use of bone, such as autografts, allografts, and artificial or synthetic bone substitutes. Certain embodiments comprise the use of polymeric materials. A combination of materials, such as a porous metal applied to a carbon fiber implant may be employed in the reinforcing member 16. Reinforcing member 16 can be osteogenic, osteoconductive, and/or osteoinductive. Osteoconductive materials that may be used include but are not limited to collagen and the various forms of calcium phosphates including hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate, and fluoroapatite. Suitable osteoinductive substances include but are not limited to bone morphogenetic proteins (e.g., rhBMP-2), demineralized bone matrix, transforming growth factors (e.g., TGF-beta), osteoblast cells, and various other organic species known to induce bone formation. Bone marrow, blood plasma, or morselized bone of the patient, or commercially available materials may also be used. The reinforcing member 16 may be treated prior to implantation. For example, the reinforcing member 16 may be dipped or coated with bone conductive or bone inductive material. Osteoinductive materials, such as BMP, may be applied to, for example, by immersing the reinforcing member 16 in an aqueous solution of this material in a dilute suspension of type I collagen. Osteoinductive materials such as TGF-beta may be applied from a saline solution containing an effective concentration of TGF-beta, or may be carried in the resilient material. Of course, other biologics may be applied by any method known in the art. The reinforcing member can be resorbable or non-resorbable. For example, the reinforcing member 16 may comprise PEEK, PGA, or PLA material. Electrical stimulation can also be applied to the bone to promote bone healing. The reinforcing member 16 may also be capable of imbibing bone stimulating material, such as porous nitinol, e.g., ACTIPORE™ or other form of porous coated titanium or periapatite coated titanium. In some embodiments, implantation of the reinforcing member 16 may be achieved step-wise in multiple stages. For example, the reinforcing member 16 may be constructed to be implanted at an initial stage to establish primary fixation, then at a subsequent stage additional implantation or assembly can be performed to add increased pull-out strength and other reinforcing properties to the fully assembled reinforcing member 16. FIGS. 2A and 2B show exemplary SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ kits 20. These kits 20 are provided for facilitating the injection of bone void filler into subchondral insufficiency fractures in a subchondral surgical procedure that will be referred to under its marketed name as SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ or SCP™. As shown, the components of the kit may include, among other things, a SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ guide/insertion instrument 40, SCP™ templates 50A, 50B, and various tools 60 for assessment and/or drilling. For example, the tools 60 provided in kit 20 may include a volume assessment tool, a fixed bone portal 62, a Kirschner wire (or K-wire) 64, a bore creation device, several injection catheters 66 sized to match the bore creation device, several syringes 68, and a portal hole plug. In some embodiments, the kits 20 are provided to surgeon or medical facility prepackaged and sterile. In addition, some or all of the instruments and tools provided in the kit 20 may be reusable or disposable. The kits 20 may also include a cavity creation device (not shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B). Cavity creation devices may include burrs, punches, reamers, rongeurs, tamps, drills 70, instruments with expandable components, such as balloons, stents or looped wires, instruments with a selectively angulatable or reconfigurable distal ends, and others known in the art. As shown, in FIG. 2A, a first embodiment of the kit 20 can include an assortment of reinforcing members, such as reinforcing member 16, of various sizes and/or shapes appropriate for use with a variety of bone lesions. The kit 20 can also include instructions for use, e.g., printed on the container and/or on inserts within the container. The kit 20 can still further include a tool for adjusting the size of the reinforcing member 16, a hammer for driving the reinforcing member 16 into the bone and/or a bone filler to seal the open end of the channel in the bone in which the reinforcing member 16 resides. As noted, the kit 20 may be prepackaged and sterile with an assortment of reusable or disposable instruments and tools. Suitable bone fillers include but are not limited to materials comprising beta-tricalcium phosphate (e.g., VITOSS, PROOSTEON 500R made by E-Interpore-Cross International), hydroxyapatite (e.g., OSTEOGRAF made by Ceramed Denta, Inc., Lakewood, Colo.), calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate (e.g., OSTEOSET and ALLOMATRIX made by Wright Medical Technology, Inc.), calcium phosphate (e.g., CALCIBON made by Merck & Co., Inc., Whitehouse Station, N.J. and NORIAN SRS made by Synthes-Strates, Switzerland), synthetic bone fillers (e.g., CORTOSS) and/or processed bone fillers (e.g., BIOOSS made by Geistlich Biomaterials, Inc., Switzerland). Other suitable materials may include hydrogels, PEEK (polyetheretherketone), carbon fiber, polycarbonate urethane (PCU), stem cells with and without matrices, collagen with and without matrices and carriers, pharmacotherapeutic with and without matrices and carriers, hyaluronic acid with and without matrices, in situ curable materials with and without anti-inflammatory agents, demineralized bone matrix, allograft, biocompatible metals, resorbable PCA, PGLA, and polyurethane, hydroxyapatite, calcium sulfate, BMP growth factor, TGF-β super family, MP52, TP508, bioactive glass, sodium alignate, AOC based carrier and active components (synthetic beeswax), and starch. In some embodiments, the bone filler may be of a type that can expand upon insertion into the void. For example, the filler may be injectable at the defect site, whereupon it can fill up or expand into the void. And as with the reinforcing member 16, the bone void filler may also be implanted in a step-wise fashion such that an initial stage to establish primary fixation is followed with a subsequent stage of assembly that provides added strength and bone integration properties to the fully assembled bone void filler. As shown in FIG. 2B, another embodiment of the kit 20 can include a fluid, a syringe for injecting the fluid into a bone and a container adapted to maintain the sterility of the contents of the container. As noted, the kit 20 may be prepackaged and sterile with an assortment of reusable or disposable instruments. This embodiment of the kit 20 can further comprise a needle and premeasured portions of ingredients in a plurality of separate vials. As with the first embodiment of the kit 20, this embodiment can optionally include instructions for use, e.g., printed on the container and/or on inserts within the container. The kit 20 can further include bone tools for providing a channel in the bone in which the fluid is injected and/or a bone filler to seal the open end of the channel in the bone in which the reinforcing member resides. The kit 20 can further include curing agents (i.e., polymerizing agents, catalysts and/or cross linking agents) as separate ingredients to be added to the injected fluid. The kit 20 can include other curing means, such as a UV light source or other device for generating radiation. The fluid can be preloaded in the syringe for injection. In some embodiments, a multiple barrel syringe can be included for in situ mixing of ingredients that must be stored separately in different barrels of the syringe (e.g., monomers and polymerizing agent, or polymers and cross linking agent, etc.). FIG. 3A shows a SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ template 50A of the kit 20 from FIG. 2A in use. FIG. 3B shows a SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ template 50B of the kit 20 from FIG. 2B in use. As part of the pre-operative planning process, medical imaging, such as an MRI illustrated in FIG. 1, is taken of the knee of a patient suffering from arthritic pain. For purposes of clarity, FIGS. 3A and 3B show the templates 50A, 50B overlaying a simplified illustration of a knee. A subchondral insufficiency fracture 92 associated with lesion 14 may then be identified and located on the MRI. The fracture size, volume and orientation are determined from the image, and based on the values, the recommended volume of bone void filler is determined from the volume assessment tool. The SCP™ templates 50A and 50B, shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, may be a transparent to indicate how a lesion can be treated. In use, for example, the templates 50A and 50B are placed over the MRI image to determine the placement of the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40, the appropriate location for a bone portal 62, and the resulting depth to the fracture. FIG. 4A shows an exemplary embodiment of a SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ guide/insertion instrument 40. As shown, the guide/insertion instrument 40 may comprise an integrated cartilage reference 42, a parallel drill/implant guide 44, and angular drill guide/portal 46 The SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 is included in the kit 20 to aim the bone portal 62 and to set the depth stop of drilling for the surgeon. As shown, the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 may comprise a curved body, a probe, and an optional adjustable arm (not shown). The curved body has a radius of curvature that provides for different angles of approach to the tip of the probe. The probe is attached to the curved body and may have a planar, rasped tip for contacting and gripping the articular surface of the knee joint without damaging the cartilage. The optional adjustable arm (not shown) may be connected to the curved body through a sliding arrangement such that the angle of the arm is adjustable with respect to the curved body. FIG. 4B shows another exemplary embodiment of the SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ guide/insertion instrument 40. As shown, in this embodiment, the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 may comprise a detachable handle 48. The detachable handle 48 may be detachable in order to facilitate its manipulation during surgery. The detachable handle 48 may be detachable based on various mechanisms that are known to those skilled in the art. FIG. 5 illustrates a side view of the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 and various options of the instrument 40. As shown, the probe of the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 may comprise integrated cartilage reference 42 and parallel drill/implant guide 44. The guide 44 is configured to guide a drill 70 or other tool to a location or target T indicated by the cartilage reference 42. In addition, in the embodiment shown, the curved body of the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument comprises an angular drill guide/portal 46. The guide/portal 46 may provide a set of guides/portals that converge at location T from various angles, such as 30 degrees and 45 degrees. FIG. 6 illustrates a perspective view of the various options of the SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ guide/insertion instrument 40. As shown, the parallel drill/implant guide 44 may comprise a series of holes/portals in a matrix configuration to help guide a drill 70 or other tool to location T. FIG. 7A shows another embodiment of a SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ guide/insertion instrument 40 and side view of how it may be placed relative to a knee during surgery. FIG. 7B shows the SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ guide/insertion instrument 40 and a perspective view of how it may be placed relative to a knee. FIGS. 8, 9A-9J, 10A-10B, 11A-11C illustrate a method of treating a knee based on embodiments of the present invention. As noted, medical imaging, such as an MRI, is taken of the knee of a patient suffering from arthritic pain. A bone marrow lesion, such as a subchondral insufficiency fracture 92, is identified and located on the MRI. The fracture size, volume and orientation are determined from the image, and based on the findings, the recommended volume of bone void filler is determined from the volume assessment tool. The SCP™ template, shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, is a transparency with a plurality of curved lines between two intersecting straight lines. In use, the template 50 is placed over the MRI image to determine the placement of the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40, the appropriate location for the fixed bone portal 62, and the resulting depth to the fracture. Referring now to FIG. 8, the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 may be positioned such that the location T of the cartilage guide 42 is in on or adjacent to the bone marrow lesion of interest. In use, the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 is placed proximate to the joint. The probe may be visually placed on the articular cartilage, for example, using arthroscopy. If present, any cartilage defect can be used to assist probe placement. The SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 helps determine the access point and angle for the K-wire (included in the kit 20), which may be used by the surgeon. For example, in some embodiments for treating a patient's knee, the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 is configured to treat subchondral bone that is within 5 mm below the tibial surface. In some embodiments, the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 has a planar, rasped tip for contacting and gripping the articular surface of the knee joint without damaging the cartilage. Using parallel drill/implant guide 44, a surgeon may then drill parallel, for example, to the articular surface of a patient's knee. In some embodiments, the surgeon drills through or adjacent to the bone marrow lesion. Referring now to FIG. 9A, the surgeon may then drill at an angle to location T of the bone marrow lesion 92 via angular drill guide/portal 46. The surgeon may select the angle of approach based on a variety of factors, such as the location of the bone marrow lesion, size of the lesion, access to the knee, etc. While the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 is held in place, a K-wire is inserted through the lumen in the adjustable arm and into interior of the bone. Fluoroscopy may be used to verify the position and depth of the wire with respect to the fracture 92. The SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 may then be removed, but the K-wire retains the angle and depth to the fracture 92. FIGS. 9B-9D illustrate in further detail how a surgeon may drill at an angle to a bone marrow lesion 92. As shown, the surgeon may install a bone portal 94, for example, using the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 (not shown). In use, the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 is placed proximate to the joint. Based on the information determined from the SCP™ template, the probe tip of SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 is placed on a target location on the articular surface of the knee joint, i.e., in or adjacent to the bone marrow lesion. As noted above, in order to treat knee pain, the bone marrow lesion 14 may be a meniscal defect associated with an underlying subchondral insufficiency fracture 92. The guide/insertion instrument 40 is used to aim a bone portal angle and to set the bone portal depth stop based on the information determined from the SCP™ template. The SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 may then be removed and the bone portal retains the angle to the fracture location. During surgery, the bone portal may also hold or steady the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40. The bone portal 62 (included in the kit 20) provides an entry point in the bone for an instrument to gain access to the interior of the bone and to the subchondral insufficiency fracture 92. The bone portal 62 may be a single component design having an elongate body. The distal end of the body may include external threads for anchoring the portal 62 to the cortex of the bone. In some embodiments, the portal 62 has an outer diameter of approximately 8 mm. The size of a particular bone portal 62 is selected to support the cortex and prevent possible damage and weakening of the surrounding cortex. The body of the bone portal 62 has a lumen for receiving an instrument therein and a length that allows for an accurate trajectory to the bone marrow lesion 14. The proximal end of the body has a depth stop for limiting the extent an instrument received within the lumen may be inserted into the interior of the bone. To facilitate the ease of implementing the SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ treatment, the bone portal 62 may serve as a working channel, enabling a multitude of instruments to pass through the same access point. In use, the bone portal 62 can be threadedly anchored to the bone cortex at a location determined from the MRI template. As shown, the bone portal 62 is installed at an angle perpendicular to the bone cortex, resulting in better coupling. Alternatively, the surgeon may use an adjustable bone portal 62 that allows for repeated entry into the bone for multiple fractures to be treated with a single bone portal insertion. The portal 62 may be made of a resorbable material, in which case it could provide as an implant left in the cortex after the SCP™ procedure is completed. Furthermore, the bone portal 62 may be radiolucent and have at least one marker for identification under imaging. The surgeon may then drill through the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 via angular drill guide/portal 46 (not shown) to create a bone cavity 96 to bone marrow lesion (as shown in FIG. 9D). The drill may be a cannulated drill 70, for example that is used over the K-wire to enlarge the channel to the fracture 92. Other bore creation devices known in the art may be used, including biopsy needles, punches, burrs, reamers, rongeurs and tamps, as well as other types of drills. FIG. 9E illustrates how the surgeon may then employ a Kirschner wire or K-wire at the site of bone marrow lesion 92. Alternatively, FIG. 9F shows the use of an adjustable bone portal 98 that allows the surgeon to select one or more angles provided by angular drill guide/portal 46 or, for example, to treat multiple sites. The adjustable bone portal shown in FIG. 9F may be included in the kit 20 to provide an entry point in the bone for different instruments to gain access to the interior of the bone and to a subchondral insufficiency fracture 92, as previously mentioned. In general, the adjustable bone portal has a body component and base component. The base component includes external threads for anchoring the portal to the cortex of the bone and a central opening for receiving the body component. The outer diameter of the base component is approximately 8 mm, selected to support the cortex and prevent possible damage and weakening of the surrounding cortex with a portal with a larger diameter. The body component may have a lumen for receiving different instruments, and a length that allows for an accurate trajectory to the defect. A proximal end of the body component has a depth stop for limiting the extent an instrument received within the lumen may be inserted into the interior of the bone. The depth stop may be adjusted according to the depth of the defect within the bone, as measured from the entry point. In some embodiments, adjustability of the bone portal is achieved through a ball-and-socket arrangement between a socketed central opening in the base component and a ball shaped distal end of the body component. A lock mechanism can be provided to maintain the base and body components in a desired position relative to each other. In another embodiment, adjustability of the bone portal is achieved through a conically shaped central opening in the base component. A locking mechanism can be provided to maintain the base and body components in a desired position relative to each other. FIGS. 9G-9J illustrates the various ways that a surgeon may treat a knee via bone cavity 96. A cavity creation device is used after a bore creating device is removed to leave an enlarged channel to the fracture, and prior to the bone void filler being prepared As shown, the surgeon may use a K-wire with a depth stop (included in the kit 20) to create an access channel to the subchondral insufficiency fracture 92. As shown in FIG. 9G-9J, the K-wire is inserted through the lumen of the bone portal body to the desired depth, which will be reached when the K-wire depth stop contacts the bone portal body depth stop. The K-wire is prevented from being advanced through the articular surface. Fluoroscopy may be used to verify the K-wire position and depth with respect to the fracture. If placement is incorrect, the K-wire can be retracted and the bone portal readjusted. The K-wire 64 is then removed. The surgeon may use a bore creation device (also included in the kit 20) to enlarge the access channel created by the K-wire 64 to the fracture. The bore creation device can be an 8-gauge biopsy needle, a core punch, or a fenestrated drill. Each can be provided with a depth stop to prevent penetration through the articular surface of the bone. Other bore creation devices known in the art may be used, including burrs, reamers, rongeurs and tamps, as well as other types of biopsy needles, punches and drills. A cavity creation device in the form of a burr, for example, is inserted through the lumen in the bone portal to the desired depth and is manually moved or activated to create a cavity. Depending on the device used, this may be accomplished by cutting bone, compressing bone, or a combination. As shown, the surgeon may use a cannulated drill, for example, being inserted through the lumen of the bone portal body until the drill depth stop contacts the bone portal body depth stop. The drill is prevented from being advanced through the articular surface. The drill is then removed, leaving an enlarged channel 96 to the fracture 92. In another embodiment, a series of cannulas or bone dilators of progressively increasing diameter may be provided. The cannulas or dilators may be used to progressively bore concentric openings within the subchondral bone. FIG. 10A illustrates another step that a surgeon may perform to treat a patient's knee. In particular, the surgeon may inject bone void filler, such as calcium phosphate (CaP) or a bone cement, such as a low viscosity Poly-methyl methacrylate (“PMMA”). During surgery, an injection catheter 66 is filled with a volume of the bone void filler, which was determined from the volume assessment tool (included in the kit 20). FIG. 10A shows the injection catheter 66 being inserted and sealed to the bone portal. Cement in the catheter 66 prevents bone shards and debris from clogging the catheter 66. Under fluoroscopy, the bone cement is injected from the catheter 66 into the subchondral insufficiency fracture 92 using a syringe 68 with volume and rate controls. The syringe 68 provides tactile feedback as the bone cement is dispensed to fill the fracture and then interdigitate with the immediately surrounding cancellous bone. The catheter 66, syringe 68 and bone portal 62 may then be removed. In order to prevent bone void filler from leaking out of the hole that remains in the cortex after removal of the bone portal, a portal hole plug (provided in the kit 20) may be used. Alternatively, the bone that was removed using the bore creation device during the channel enlargement step may be sized and shaped as a plug to fill the portal hole. Of note, the injection of a bone void filler can be before or after the implantation of reinforcing member 16. If desired, the bone marrow lesion or edema may be aspirated prior to insertion of the implant or infusion of the bone void filler. This aspiration step may be performed through the angular drill guide/portal 46, and suction may be performed through the parallel drill/implant guide 44. For example, as shown, an 8-gauge needle 102 may be guided via parallel drill/implant guide 44 in or adjacent to the bone marrow lesion. FIG. 10B illustrates another view of the surgeon injecting CaP cement via the parallel drill/implant guide 44. In some embodiments, the surgeon may drill one or more holes at various locations. In addition, the surgeon may leave the drill bits in place in order to stability the SCP™ tool guide 40. Alternatively, the surgeon may insert one or more bone conductive pins through the SCP™ tool guide 40 and into pre-drilled holes. After the implants have been implanted, the SCP™ tool guide 40 may be removed and pins cut flush to the bone surface. FIGS. 11A-11C illustrate another step that a surgeon may perform to treat a patient's knee. For example, FIG. 11A shows a side view of surgeon injecting CaP cement in or adjacent to a bone marrow lesion using 8-gauge needles 102. As shown, the 8-gauge needles 102 are guided using SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 to converge in or adjacent to bone marrow lesion. Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 11B, once the drills have been inserted, the surgeon may remove the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 (not shown) and guide an 8-gauge needle 102 over the drill to inject CaP cement in or adjacent to the bone marrow lesion. For example, a catheter 66 filled with bone cement is then injected into the bone cavity 96 to fill the cavity and then any interstitial space of surrounding uncompressed cancellous bone. FIGS. 12-16 illustrate a method of treating a bone based on another embodiment of the present invention. In particular, as shown in FIG. 12, the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 may comprise a detachable handle that the surgeon removes initially to position the guide/insertion instrument 40, for example, on the articular surface. Referring now to FIG. 13, the surgeon may then drill via parallel drill/implant guide 44 towards the site of a bone marrow lesion (not shown). As shown in FIG. 14, the surgeon injects CaP cement using an 8-gauge needle over the drill in or adjacent to the bone marrow lesion. Next, as shown in FIG. 15, the surgeon may reattach the detachable handle 48 to the SCP™ guide/insertion instrument 40 and drill in or through the bone marrow lesion (not shown) via angular drill guide/portal 46. As shown in FIG. 16, if desired, the surgeon may then inject CaP cement using a cannula with injection port or fenestrated distal tip for target placement or dispersion of the bone void filler, or the 8-gauge needle 102, over the drill to inject CaP cement in or adjacent to the bone marrow lesion via angular drill guide/portal 46. While the invention is described in the context of osteoarthritis of the knee, it is not limited to such condition. Other conditions that can be treated in accordance with the invention include but are not limited to osteoarthritis of joints other than the knee, such as the shoulder, hip and ankle. For example, the SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ treatment may be used to treat other joints, such as the shoulder, hip, and ankle. Moreover, in some embodiments, the SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ treatment may be coupled to other forms of joint pain treatment. For instance, in the knee, the SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ treatment may be employed in conjunction with a microfracture, arthroscopic/arthrosurface, uni-knee replacement, or partial bone resurfacing procedure. In such cases, the SUBCHONDROPLASTY™ procedure itself becomes a component in a multi-step treatment process to address the overall pain management and treatment of the joint. Other embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the disclosure provided herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope and spirit of the disclosure being indicated by the following claims. 1.-10. (canceled) 11.
