Such copolymers further contain carbonate units derived from oligomeric ester-containing dihydroxy compounds (also referred to herein as hydroxy end-capped oligomeric acrylate esters). For example, Such copolymers further contain, in addition to recurring carbonate chain units of the formula (1), repeating units of formula (6) wherein E is a divalent radical derived from a dihydroxy compound, and may be, for example, a C2-10 alkylene radical, a C6-20 alicyclic radical, a C6-20 aromatic radical or a polyoxyalkylene radical in which the alkylene groups contain 2 carbon atoms to about 6 carbon atoms, specifically 2, 3, or 4 carbon atoms; and T is a divalent radical derived from a dicarboxylic acid, and may be, for example, a C2-10 alkylene radical, a C6-20 alicyclic radical, a C6-20 alkyl aromatic radical, or a C6-20 aromatic radical.

Acids containing fused rings can also be present, such as in 1,4-, 1,5-, or 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acids. Specific dicarboxylic acids are terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, naphthalene dicarboxylic acid, cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, or mixtures thereof. A specific dicarboxylic acid comprises a mixture of isophthalic acid and terephthalic acid wherein the weight ratio of terephthalic acid to isophthalic acid is about 10:1 to about 0.2:9.8. In another specific embodiment, E is a C2-6 alkylene radical and T is p-phenylene, m-phenylene, naphthalene, a divalent cycloaliphatic radical, or a mixture thereof. This class of polyester includes the poly(alkylene terephthalates). In various aspects, it is understood and herein contemplated that to improve the impact resistance of an existing polymeric blend occurs by removing polycarbonate and substituting a terpolymer. Thus, for every percentage weight increase of the terpolymer, there should be a corresponding decrease in one or more components of the blend, including, for example, a polycarbonate. In one aspect, specifically disclosed are polycarbonate compositions comprising an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene polymer and an isosorbide-resorcinol-bisphenol A polycarbonate terpolymer, wherein a polycarbonate comprises from about 3% to 55% wt of the composition. Accordingly, in one aspect, disclosed herein are polycarbonate compositions comprising an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene polymer and an isosorbide-resorcinol-bisphenol A polycarbonate terpolymer, wherein a polycarbonate comprises 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, or 55% wt of the total composition. In another aspect, the terpolymer of the present disclosure can comprise from about 3% wt to 20% wt of the composition, for example, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20% wt of the composition. For example, specifically disclosed are aspects where the terpolymer comprises about 3.1% wt of the composition. Also disclosed are aspects where the terpolymer comprises about 8% wt of the composition. Also disclosed are aspects where the terpolymer comprises about 14.7% wt of the composition. In one aspect, polycarbonates can be manufactured using an interfacial phase transfer process or melt polymerization. Although the reaction conditions for interfacial polymerization can vary, an exemplary process generally involves dissolving or dispersing a dihydric phenol reactant in aqueous caustic soda or potash, adding the resulting mixture to a water-immiscible solvent medium such as for example methylene chloride, and contacting the reactants with a carbonate precursor (such as phosgene) in the presence of a catalyst such as, for example, triethylamine or a phase transfer catalyst salt, under controlled pH conditions of, for example, from about 8 to about 10. The polycarbonates disclosed herein can, in various aspects, be prepared by a melt polymerization process. Generally, in the melt polymerization process, polycarbonates are prepared by co-reacting, in a molten state, the dihydroxy reactant(s) (i.e., isosorbide, aliphatic diol and/or aliphatic diacid, and any additional dihydroxy compound) and a diaryl carbonate ester, such as diphenyl carbonate, or more specifically in an aspect, an activated carbonate such as bis(methyl salicyl)carbonate, in the presence of a transesterification catalyst. The reaction can be carried out in typical polymerization equipment, such as one or more continuously stirred reactors (CSTRs), plug flow reactors, wire wetting fall polymerizers, free fall polymerizers, wiped film polymerizers, BANBURY® mixers, single or twin screw extruders, or combinations of the foregoing. In one aspect, volatile monohydric phenol can be removed from the molten reactants by distillation and the polymer is isolated as a molten residue. In another aspect, a useful melt process for making polycarbonates utilizes a diaryl carbonate ester having electron-withdrawing substituents on the aryls. Examples of specifically useful diaryl carbonate esters with electron withdrawing substituents include bis(4-nitrophenyl)carbonate, bis(2-chlorophenyl)carbonate, bis(4-chlorophenyl)carbonate, bis(methyl salicyl)carbonate, bis(4-methylcarboxylphenyl)carbonate, bis(2-acetylphenyl)carboxylate, bis(4-acetylphenyl)carboxylate, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. The melt polymerization can include a transesterification catalyst comprising a first catalyst, also referred to herein as an alpha catalyst, comprising a metal cation and an anion. In an aspect, the cation is an alkali or alkaline earth metal comprising Li, Na, K, Cs, Rb, Mg, Ca, Ba, Sr, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. The anion is hydroxide (OH−), superoxide (O2−), thiolate (HS−), sulfide (S2−), a C1-20 alkoxide, a C6-20 aryloxide, a C1-20 carboxylate, a phosphate including biphosphate, a C1-20 phosphonate, a sulfate including bisulfate, sulfites including bisulfites and metabisulfites, a C1-20 sulfonate, a carbonate including bicarbonate, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. In another aspect, salts of an organic acid comprising both alkaline earth metal ions and alkali metal ions can also be used. Salts of organic acids useful as catalysts are illustrated by alkali metal and alkaline earth metal salts of formic acid, acetic acid, stearic acid and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid. The catalyst can also comprise the salt of a non-volatile inorganic acid. By “nonvolatile”, it is meant that the referenced compounds have no appreciable vapor pressure at ambient temperature and pressure. In particular, these compounds are not volatile at temperatures at which melt polymerizations of polycarbonate are typically conducted. The salts of nonvolatile acids are alkali metal salts of phosphites; alkaline earth metal salts of phosphites; alkali metal salts of phosphates; and alkaline earth metal salts of phosphates. Exemplary transesterification catalysts include, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, lithium formate, sodium formate, potassium formate, cesium formate, lithium acetate, sodium acetate, potassium acetate, lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, lithium methoxide, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, lithium ethoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, lithium phenoxide, sodium phenoxide, potassium phenoxide, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, NaH2PO3, NaH2PO4, Na2H2PO3, KH2PO4, CsH2PO4, Cs2H2PO4, Na2SO3, Na2S2O5, sodium mesylate, potassium mesylate, sodium tosylate, potassium tosylate, magnesium disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA magnesium disodium salt), or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. It will be understood that the foregoing list is exemplary and should not be considered as limited thereto. In one aspect, the transesterification catalyst is an alpha catalyst comprising an alkali or alkaline earth salt. In an exemplary aspect, the transesterification catalyst comprising sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, NaH2PO4, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. The amount of alpha catalyst can vary widely according to the conditions of the melt polymerization, and can be about 0.001 to about 500 μmol. In an aspect, the amount of alpha catalyst can be about 0.01 to about 20 μmol, specifically about 0.1 to about 10 μmol, more specifically about 0.5 to about 9 μmol, and still more specifically about 1 to about 7 μmol, per mole of aliphatic diol and any other dihydroxy compound present in the melt polymerization. In another aspect, a second transesterification catalyst, also referred to herein as a beta catalyst, can optionally be included in the melt polymerization process, provided that the inclusion of such a second transesterification catalyst does not significantly adversely affect the desirable properties of the isosorbide-based polycarbonate. Exemplary transesterification catalysts can further include a combination of a phase transfer catalyst of formula (R3)4Q+X above, wherein each R3 is the same or different, and is a C1-10 alkyl group; Q is a nitrogen or phosphorus atom; and X is a halogen atom or a C1-8 alkoxy group or C6-18 aryloxy group. Exemplary phase transfer catalyst salts include, for example, [CH3(CH2)3]4NX, [CH3(CH2)3]4PX, [CH3(CH2)5]4NX, [CH3(CH2)6]4NX, [CH3(CH2)4]4NX, CH3[CH3(CH2)3]3NX, and CH3[CH3(CH2)2]3NX, wherein X is Cl−, Br−, a C1-8 alkoxy group or a C6-18 aryloxy group. Examples of such transesterification catalysts include tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, methyltributylammonium hydroxide, tetrabutylammonium acetate, tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide, tetrabutylphosphonium acetate, tetrabutylphosphonium phenolate, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. Other melt transesterification catalysts include alkaline earth metal salts or alkali metal salts. In various aspects, where a beta catalyst is desired, the beta catalyst can be present in a molar ratio, relative to the alpha catalyst, of less than or equal to 10, specifically less than or equal to 5, more specifically less than or equal to 1, and still more specifically less than or equal to 0.5. In other aspects, the melt polymerization reaction disclosed herein uses only an alpha catalyst as described hereinabove, and is substantially free of any beta catalyst. As defined herein, “substantially free of” can mean where the beta catalyst has been excluded from the melt polymerization reaction. In one aspect, the beta catalyst is present in an amount of less than about 10 ppm, specifically less than 1 ppm, more specifically less than about 0.1 ppm, more specifically less than or equal to about 0.01 ppm, and more specifically less than or equal to about 0.001 ppm, based on the total weight of all components used in the melt polymerization reaction. In one aspect, a melt process employing an activated carbonate is utilized. As used herein, the term “activated carbonate”, is defined as a diarylcarbonate that is more reactive than diphenylcarbonate in transesterification reactions. Specific non-limiting examples of activated carbonates include bis(o-methoxycarbonylphenyl)carbonate, bis(o-chlorophenyl)carbonate, bis(o-nitrophenyl)carbonate, bis(o-acetylphenyl)carbonate, bis(o-phenylketonephenyl)carbonate, bis(o-formylphenyl)carbonate. Examples of specific ester-substituted diarylcarbonates include, but are not limited to, bis(methylsalicyl)carbonate (CAS Registry No. 82091-12-1) (also known as BMSC or bis(o-methoxycarbonylphenyl)carbonate), bis(ethylsalicyl)carbonate, bis(propylsalicyl)carbonate, bis(butylsalicyl)carbonate, bis(benzylsalicyl)carbonate, bis(methyl-4-chlorosalicyl)carbonate and the like. In one aspect, bis(methylsalicyl)carbonate is used as the activated carbonate in melt polycarbonate synthesis due to its lower molecular weight and higher vapor pressure. Some non-limiting examples of non-activating groups which, when present in an ortho position, would not be expected to result in activated carbonates are alkyl, cycloalkyl or cyano groups. Some specific and non-limiting examples of non-activated carbonates are bis(o-methylphenyl)carbonate, bis(p-cumylphenyl)carbonate, bis(p-(1,1,3,3-tetramethyl)butylphenyl)carbonate and bis(o-cyanophenyl)carbonate. Unsymmetrical combinations of these structures can also be used as non-activated carbonates. In one aspect, an end-capping agent (also referred to as a chain-stopper) can optionally be used to limit molecular weight growth rate, and so control molecular weight in the polycarbonate. Exemplary chain-stoppers include certain monophenolic compounds (i.e., phenyl compounds having a single free hydroxy group), monocarboxylic acid chlorides, and/or monochloroformates. Phenolic chain-stoppers are exemplified by phenol and C1-C22 alkyl-substituted phenols such as p-cumyl-phenol, resorcinol monobenzoate, and p- and tertiary-butyl phenol, cresol, and monoethers of diphenols, such as p-methoxyphenol. Alkyl-substituted phenols with branched chain alkyl substituents having 8 to 9 carbon atoms can be specifically mentioned. Certain monophenolic UV absorbers can also be used as a capping agent, for example 4-substituted-2-hydroxybenzophenones and their derivatives, aryl salicylates, monoesters of diphenols such as resorcinol monobenzoate, 2-(2-hydroxyaryl)-benzotriazoles and their derivatives, 2-(2-hydroxyaryl)-1,3,5-triazines and their derivatives, and the like. In another aspect, endgroups can be derived from the carbonyl source (i.e., the diaryl carbonate), from selection of monomer ratios, incomplete polymerization, chain scission, and the like, as well as any added end-capping groups, and can include derivatizable functional groups such as hydroxy groups, carboxylic acid groups, or the like. In one aspect, the endgroup of a polycarbonate, including an isosorbide-based polycarbonate polymer as defined herein, can comprise a structural unit derived from a diaryl carbonate, where the structural unit can be an endgroup. In a further aspect, the endgroup is derived from an activated carbonate. Such endgroups can be derived from the transesterification reaction of the alkyl ester of an appropriately substituted activated carbonate, with a hydroxy group at the end of a polycarbonate polymer chain, under conditions in which the hydroxy group reacts with the ester carbonyl from the activated carbonate, instead of with the carbonate carbonyl of the activated carbonate. In this way, structural units derived from ester containing compounds or substructures derived from the activated carbonate and present in the melt polymerization reaction can form ester endgroups. In an aspect, the ester endgroup derived from a salicylic ester can be a residue of BMSC or other substituted or unsubstituted bis(alkyl salicyl)carbonate such as bis(ethyl salicyl)carbonate, bis(propyl salicyl)carbonate, bis(phenyl salicyl)carbonate, bis(benzyl salicyl)carbonate, or the like. In one aspect, where a combination of alpha and beta catalysts are used in the melt polymerization, an isosorbide-based polycarbonate polymer prepared from an activated carbonate can comprise endgroups in an amount of less than 2,000 ppm, less than 1,500 ppm, or less than 1,000 ppm, based on the weight of the polycarbonate. In another aspect, where only an alpha catalyst is used in the melt polymerization, an isosorbide-based polycarbonate polymer prepared from an activated carbonate can comprise endgroups in an amount of less than or equal to 500 ppm, less than or equal to 400 ppm, less than or equal to 300 ppm, or less than or equal to 200 ppm, based on the weight of the polycarbonate. In one aspect, the reactants for the polymerization reaction using an activated aromatic carbonate can be charged into a reactor either in the solid form or in the molten form. Initial charging of reactants into a reactor and subsequent mixing of these materials under reactive conditions for polymerization can be conducted in an inert gas atmosphere such as a nitrogen atmosphere. The charging of one or more reactants can also be done at a later stage of the polymerization reaction. Mixing of the reaction mixture is accomplished by any methods known in the art, such as by stirring. Reactive conditions include time, temperature, pressure and other factors that affect polymerization of the reactants. Typically the activated aromatic carbonate is added at a mole ratio of 0.8 to 1.3, and more preferably 0.9 to 1.3, and all subranges there between, relative to the total moles of monomer unit compounds. In a specific aspect, the molar ratio of activated aromatic carbonate to monomer unit compounds is 1.013 to 1.29, specifically 1.015 to 1.028. In another specific aspect, the activated aromatic carbonate is BMSC. In one aspect, the melt polymerization reaction can be conducted by subjecting the reaction mixture to a series of temperature-pressure-time protocols. In some aspects, this involves gradually raising the reaction temperature in stages while gradually lowering the pressure in stages. In one aspect, the pressure is reduced from about atmospheric pressure at the start of the reaction to about 1 millibar (100 Pa) or lower, or in another aspect to 0.1 millibar (10 Pa) or lower in several steps as the reaction approaches completion. The temperature can be varied in a stepwise fashion beginning at a temperature of about the melting temperature of the reaction mixture and subsequently increased to final temperature. In one aspect, the reaction mixture is heated from room temperature to about 150° C. In such an aspect, the polymerization reaction starts at a temperature of about 150° C. to about 220° C. In another aspect, the polymerization temperature can be up to about 220° C. In other aspects, the polymerization reaction can then be increased to about 250° C. and then optionally further increased to a temperature of about 320° C., and all subranges there between. In one aspect, the total reaction time can be from about 30 minutes to about 200 minutes and all subranges there between. This procedure will generally ensure that the reactants react to give polycarbonates with the desired molecular weight, glass transition temperature and physical properties. The reaction proceeds to build the polycarbonate chain with production of ester-substituted alcohol by-product such as methyl salicylate. In one aspect, efficient removal of the by-product can be achieved by different techniques such as reducing the pressure. Generally the pressure starts relatively high in the beginning of the reaction and is lowered progressively throughout the reaction and temperature is raised throughout the reaction. In one aspect, the progress of the reaction can be monitored by measuring the melt viscosity or the weight average molecular weight of the reaction mixture using techniques known in the art such as gel permeation chromatography. These properties can be measured by taking discrete samples or can be measured on-line. After the desired melt viscosity and/or molecular weight is reached, the final polycarbonate product can be isolated from the reactor in a solid or molten form. It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art, that the method of making aliphatic homopolycarbonate and aliphatic-aromatic copolycarbonates as described in the preceding sections can be made in a batch or a continuous process and the process disclosed herein is preferably carried out in a solvent free mode. Reactors chosen should ideally be self-cleaning and should minimize any “hot spots.” However, vented extruders similar to those that are commercially available can be used. In one aspect, the aliphatic homopolycarbonate and aliphatic-aromatic copolycarbonate can be prepared in an extruder in presence of one or more catalysts, wherein the carbonating agent is an activated aromatic carbonate. In one aspect, the reactants for the polymerization reaction can be fed to the extruder in powder or molten form. In another aspect, the reactants are dry blended prior to addition to the extruder. The extruder can be equipped with pressure reducing devices (e.g., vents), which serve to remove the activated phenol by-product and thus drive the polymerization reaction toward completion. The molecular weight of the polycarbonate product can, in various aspects, be manipulated by controlling, among other factors, the feed rate of the reactants, the type of extruder, the extruder screw design and configuration, the residence time in the extruder, the reaction temperature and the pressure reducing techniques present on the extruder. The molecular weight of the polycarbonate product can also depend upon the structures of the reactants, such as, activated aromatic carbonate, aliphatic diol, dihydroxy aromatic compound, and the catalyst employed. Many different screw designs and extruder configurations are commercially available that use single screws, double screws, vents, back flight and forward flight zones, seals, and sidestreams. One skilled in the art can find the best designs using generally known principals of commercial extruder design. Controlling the ratio of diarylcarbonate/diol, specifically BMSC/diol can impact the Mw when using an activated carbonate. A lower ratio can generally provide a higher molecular weight. In one aspect, decomposition by-products of the reaction that are of low molecular weight can be removed by, for example, devolatilization during reaction and/or extrusion to reduce the amount of such volatile compounds. The volatiles typically removed can include unreacted starting diol materials, carbonate precursor materials, but are more specifically the decomposition products of the melt-polymerization reaction. In addition to the isosorbide-based polycarbonates described above, thermoplastic compositions comprising combinations of the isosorbide-based polycarbonate with other thermoplastic polymers that do not comprise isosorbide-based carbonate units can be prepared using, for example other polycarbonates including homopolycarbonates and other polycarbonate copolymers (i.e., copolycarbonates). These combinations can comprise 1 to 99 wt %, specifically 10 to 90, more specifically 20 to 80 wt % of the isosorbide-based polycarbonate, with the remainder of the compositions being other of the foregoing additional polymers, and/or additives as described below. In an aspect, the thermoplastic composition comprises the isosorbide-based polycarbonate, an additional polymer, and/or an additive. Polycarbonate-Polysiloxane Copolymers The composition further comprises a polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer comprising polycarbonate blocks and polydiorganosiloxane blocks. The polycarbonate blocks in the copolymer comprise repeating structural units of formula (1) as described above, for example wherein R1 is of formula (2) as described above. These units may be derived from reaction of dihydroxy compounds of formula (3) as described above. In a further aspect, the dihydroxy compound is bisphenol A, in which each of A1 and A2 is p-phenylene and Y1 is isopropylidene. The polydiorganosiloxane blocks comprise repeating structural units of formula (8) (sometimes referred to herein as siloxane): wherein each occurrence of R is same or different, and is a C1-13 monovalent organic radical. For example, R may be a C1-C13 alkyl group, C1-C13 alkoxy group, C2-C13 alkenyl group, C2-C13 alkenyloxy group, C3-C6 cycloalkyl group, C3-C6 cycloalkoxy group, C6-C10 aryl group, C6-C10 aryloxy group, C7-C13 aralkyl group, C7-C13 aralkoxy group, C7-C13 alkaryl group, or C7-C13 alkaryloxy group. Combinations of the foregoing R groups may be used in the same copolymer. The value of D in formula (8) may vary widely depending on the type and relative amount of each component in the thermoplastic composition, the desired properties of the composition, and like considerations. Generally, D may have an average value of 2 to about 1000, specifically about 2 to about 500, more specifically about 5 to about 100. In one embodiment, D has an average value of about 10 to about 75, and in still another embodiment, D has an average value of about 40 to about 60. Where D is of a lower value, e.g., less than about 40, it may be desirable to use a relatively larger amount of the polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer. Conversely, where D is of a higher value, e.g., greater than about 40, it may be necessary to use a relatively lower amount of the polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer. A combination of a first and a second (or more) polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymers may be used, wherein the average value of D of the first copolymer is less than the average value of D of the second copolymer. In one embodiment, the polydiorganosiloxane blocks are provided by repeating structural units of formula (9): wherein D is as defined above; each R may be the same or different, and is as defined above; and Ar may be the same or different, and is a substituted or unsubstituted C6-C30 arylene radical, wherein the bonds are directly connected to an aromatic moiety. Suitable Ar groups in formula (9) may be derived from a C6-C30 dihydroxyarylene compound, for example a dihydroxyarylene compound of formula (3), (4), or (7) above. Combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing dihydroxyarylene compounds may also be used. Specific examples of suitable dihydroxyarylene compounds are 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)butane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)octane, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) n-butane, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxy-1-methylphenyl)propane, 1,1-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)cyclohexane, bis(4-hydroxyphenyl sulphide), and 1,1-bis(4-hydroxy-t-butylphenyl)propane. Combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing dihydroxy compounds may also be used. Such units may be derived from the corresponding dihydroxy compound of the following formula: wherein Ar and D are as described above. Such compounds are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,746,701 to Kress et al. Compounds of this formula may be obtained by the reaction of a dihydroxyarylene compound with, for example, an alpha, omega-bisacetoxypolydiorangonosiloxane under phase transfer conditions. In another embodiment the polydiorganosiloxane blocks comprise repeating structural units of formula (10) wherein R and D are as defined above. R2 in formula (10) is a divalent C2-C8 aliphatic group. Each M in formula (9) may be the same or different, and may be a halogen, cyano, nitro, C1-C8 alkylthio, C1-C8 alkyl, C1-C8 alkoxy, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 alkenyloxy group, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, C3-C8 cycloalkoxy, C6-C10 aryl, C6-C10 aryloxy, C7-C12 aralkyl, C7-C12 aralkoxy, C7-C12 alkaryl, or C7-C12 alkaryloxy, wherein each n is independently 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. In one embodiment, M is bromo or chloro, an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, or propyl, an alkoxy group such as methoxy, ethoxy, or propoxy, or an aryl group such as phenyl, chlorophenyl, or tolyl; R2 is a dimethylene, trimethylene or tetramethylene group; and R is a C1-8 alkyl, haloalkyl such as trifluoropropyl, cyanoalkyl, or aryl such as phenyl, chlorophenyl or tolyl. In another embodiment, R is methyl, or a mixture of methyl and trifluoropropyl, or a mixture of methyl and phenyl. In still another embodiment, M is methoxy, n is one, R2 is a divalent C1-C3 aliphatic group, and R is methyl. These units may be derived from the corresponding dihydroxy polydiorganosiloxane (11): wherein R, D, M, R2, and n are as described above. Such dihydroxy polysiloxanes can be made by effecting a platinum catalyzed addition between a siloxane hydride of the formula (12): wherein R and D are as previously defined, and an aliphatically unsaturated monohydric phenol. Suitable aliphatically unsaturated monohydric phenols included, for example, eugenol, 2-alkylphenol, 4-allyl-2-methylphenol, 4-allyl-2-phenylphenol, 4-allyl-2-bromophenol, 4-allyl-2-t-butoxyphenol, 4-phenyl-2-phenylphenol, 2-methyl-4-propylphenol, 2-allyl-4,6-dimethylphenol, 2-allyl-4-bromo-6-methylphenol, 2-allyl-6-methoxy-4-methylphenol and 2-allyl-4,6-dimethylphenol. Mixtures comprising at least one of the foregoing may also be used. The polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer may be manufactured by reaction of diphenolic polysiloxane (11) with a carbonate source and a dihydroxy aromatic compound of formula (3), optionally in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst as described above. Suitable conditions are similar to those useful in forming polycarbonates. For example, the copolymers are prepared by phosgenation, at temperatures from below 0° C. to about 100° C., preferably about 25° C. to about 50° C. Since the reaction is exothermic, the rate of phosgene addition may be used to control the reaction temperature. The amount of phosgene required will generally depend upon the amount of the dihydric reactants. Alternatively, the polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymers may be prepared by co-reacting in a molten state, the dihydroxy monomers and a diaryl carbonate ester, such as diphenyl carbonate, in the presence of a transesterification catalyst as described above. In the production of the polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer, the amount of dihydroxy polydiorganosiloxane is selected so as to provide the desired amount of polydiorganosiloxane units in the copolymer. The amount of polydiorganosiloxane units may vary widely, i.e., may be about 1 wt. % to about 99 wt. % of polydimethylsiloxane, or an equivalent molar amount of another polydiorganosiloxane, with the balance being carbonate units. The particular amounts used will therefore be determined depending on desired physical properties of the thermoplastic composition, the value of D (within the range of 2 to about 1000), and the type and relative amount of each component in the thermoplastic composition, including the type and amount of polycarbonate, type and amount of impact modifier, type and amount of polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer, and type and amount of any other additives. Suitable amounts of dihydroxy polydiorganosiloxane can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation using the guidelines taught herein. For example, the amount of dihydroxy polydiorganosiloxane may be selected so as to produce a copolymer comprising about 1 wt. % to about 75 wt. %, or about 1 wt. % to about 50 wt. % polydimethylsiloxane, or an equivalent molar amount of another polydiorganosiloxane. In one embodiment, the copolymer comprises about 5 wt. % to about 40 wt. %, optionally about 5 wt. % to about 25 wt. % polydimethylsiloxane, or an equivalent molar amount of another polydiorganosiloxane, with the balance being polycarbonate. In a particular embodiment, the copolymer may comprise about 20 wt. % siloxane. The polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymers have a weight-average molecular weight (MW, measured, for example, by gel permeation chromatography, ultra-centrifugation, or light scattering) of about 10,000 g/mol to about 200,000 g/mol, specifically about 20,000 g/mol to about 100,000 g/mol. It is the siloxane component of the polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer that is believed to yield the superior ductility characteristics demonstrated in the Examples below. Accordingly, the quantity of polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer in the composition may be selected to provide a desired siloxane content in the composition. For example, to achieve at least 1 wt. % siloxane in the composition using a polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer containing 20 wt. % siloxane, the composition may comprise at least 5 wt. % by weight of the polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer, or at least 10 wt. % of a polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer containing only 10 wt. % siloxane in the copolymer, etc. In various embodiments, the composition may comprise at least about 1 wt. % siloxane, optionally at least 1.3 wt. % siloxane, to provide low temperature (e.g., −30° C. or −40° C.) ductility. In other embodiments, the composition may comprise at least about 2 wt. % siloxane, optionally at least 2.5 wt. % siloxane or, optionally, about 5 wt. % siloxane or more, for ductility at low temperatures. In still other embodiments, the composition may comprise 1 to 15 wt. % or 2 to 9 wt. % or, optionally, 1 to 5 wt. % polydimethyl siloxane units or the equivalent molar amount of other polydiorgano siloxane units (“siloxane”) calculated with respect to the weight of the total composition. The amount of polycarbonate in the composition will vary according to the quantity of the other components, especially the polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer, so that when more polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer is used, less polycarbonate may be used. For example, to provide a selected siloxane content in a composition, less of a high siloxane-content polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer is needed than of a low-siloxane content copolymer, so polycarbonate may constitute a larger proportion in the former case than in the latter, other components optionally being unchanged. For example, a composition may comprise 75 wt. % polycarbonate resin and 10 wt. % of a polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer comprising about 20 wt. % siloxane and 80 wt. % polycarbonate groups in the copolymer, providing 2 wt. % siloxane in the composition and 8 wt. % polycarbonate groups in addition to the 75 wt. % polycarbonate for a total of 83 wt. % polycarbonate component in the composition. Another composition containing 83 wt. % polycarbonate component and 2 wt. % siloxane may comprise 65 wt. % polycarbonate resin and 20 wt. % of a polycarbonate-polysiloxane copolymer comprising 10 wt. % siloxane and 90 wt. % polycarbonate groups in the copolymer. Impact Modifier The polycarbonate of the present invention comprises one or more impact modifying agents, or impact modifiers. In one aspect, suitable impact modifiers are can be high molecular weight elastomeric materials derived from olefins, monovinyl aromatic monomers, acrylic and methacrylic acids and their ester derivatives, as well as conjugated dienes. The polymers formed from conjugated dienes can be fully or partially hydrogenated. The elastomeric materials can be in the form of homopolymers or copolymers, including random, block, radial block, graft, and core-shell copolymers. In another aspect, a combination of any two or more individual impact modifiers can be used. An exemplary type of impact modifier is an elastomer-modified graft copolymer comprising an elastomeric (i.e., rubbery) polymer substrate having a Tg less than about 10° C., less than about −10° C., or about −40° C. to −80° C., and a rigid polymeric superstrate grafted to the elastomeric polymer substrate. Materials suitable for use as the elastomeric phase include, for example, conjugated diene rubbers, for example polybutadiene and polyisoprene; copolymers of a conjugated diene with less than about 50 wt % of a copolymerizable monomer, for example a monovinylic compound such as styrene, acrylonitrile, n-butyl acrylate, or ethyl acrylate; olefin rubbers such as ethylene propylene copolymers (EPR) or ethylene-propylene-diene monomer rubbers (EPDM); ethylene-vinyl acetate rubbers; silicone rubbers; elastomeric C1-8 alkyl(meth)acrylates; elastomeric copolymers of C1-8 alkyl(meth)acrylates with butadiene and/or styrene; or combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing elastomers. Materials suitable for use as the rigid phase include, for example, monovinyl aromatic monomers such as styrene and alpha-methyl styrene, and monovinylic monomers such as acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, and the C1-6 esters of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid, specifically poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA). Exemplary elastomer-modified graft copolymers include those formed from styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene (SEBS), ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene), acrylonitrile-ethylene-propylene-diene-styrene (AES), styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS), methyl methacrylate-butadiene-styrene (MBS), and styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN). In one aspect, the inventive polycarbonate composition comprises a styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene (SEBS) elastomer. In one aspect, a SEBS impact modifier comprises about 13 wt. % styrene, such as, for example, KRATON® G 1657M, available from Kraton Polymers. In another aspect, a SEBS impact modifier comprises about 33 wt. % styrene, such as, for example, KRATON® G 1651H, available from Kraton Polymers. In yet another aspect, a SEBS impact modifier comprises about 67 wt. % styrene, such as, for example, TUFTEC® H1043, available from Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corporation. In other aspects, other SEBS impact modifiers comprising various amounts of styrene can be used. Such impact modifiers are commercially available, and one of skill in the art, in possession of this disclosure, could readily select an appropriate SEBS impact modifier. In one aspect, an inventive polycarbonate composition can comprise from about 1 wt. % to 30 wt %, for example, about 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, or 30 wt. %, of an impact modifier, based on the total weight of the isosorbide-based polycarbonate, and any additional polymer including impact modifier, in the composition. In another aspect, an inventive polycarbonate composition can comprise from about 1 wt. % to about 25 wt. %, for example, about 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, or 25 wt. %, for example, about 21 wt. % of an impact modifier. In a specific aspect, an inventive polycarbonate composition comprises from about 21% wt. of PMMA. In other aspects, the a specific amount of any one or more impact modifiers can vary, based on the remaining components in the system and desired properties of the resulting polymer. One of skill in the art, in possession of this disclosure, could readily select an appropriate amount of any one or more impact modifiers to use in a polymer composition. In one aspect, a polycarbonate without an additional impact modifier can have a low Notched Izod Impact (NII) rating, for example, less than about 5 (i.e., it is brittle, for example isosorbide-resorcinol-bisphenol A has an impact of 5.27 and poly lactic acid even lower still). Alternatively, a polycarbonate can have an impact score revealing ductility (e.g., PC172X has an impact score of 56.69 kJ·m2). In one aspect, when an impact modifier is blended with a polycarbonate blend, the NII strength can be improved as compared to conventional a polycarbonate blend not containing an impact modifier. In one aspect, the disclosed polycarbonate compositions disclosed herein further comprise an impact modifier, such as, for example, poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA). In one aspect disclosed herein are polycarbonate compositions comprising a) about 14% wt acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; b) about 8% wt PC172; c) about 6.7% wt PC105; d) about 21% wt poly methyl methacrylate; and e) about 38% wt isosorbide-resorcinol-bisphenol A polycarbonate terpolymer. Also disclosed are polycarbonate compositions comprising a) about 14% wt acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; b) about 3.1% wt PC105; c) about 21% wt poly methyl methacrylate; and d) about 49.6% wt isosorbide-resorcinol-bisphenol A polycarbonate terpolymer. Also disclosed are polycarbonate compositions comprising a) about 14% wt acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; b) about 21% wt poly methyl methacrylate; and c) about 56.7% wt isosorbide-resorcinol-bisphenol A polycarbonate terpolymer. In another aspect, the NII strength of a polymeric blended composition can be improved by adding an impact modifier that is more brittle rather than more ductile than the composition without the impact modifier. For example In one aspect, the disclosed polycarbonate compositions disclosed herein further comprise an impact modifier, such as, for example, poly lactic acid (PLA). It is contemplated herein that if an impact modifier with high impact (i.e., highly ductile) substituted with a brittle impact modifier, impact can increase. Accordingly, one method of improving impact strength is by substituting in whole or in part a ductile impact modifier (e.g., PMMA) with a more brittle impact modifier (e.g., PLA). Accordingly, in one aspect disclosed are polycarbonate compositions comprising a) about 14% wt acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene; b) b) about 21% wt poly lactic acid; and c) about 56.7% wt isosorbide-resorcinol-bisphenol A polycarbonate terpolymer. As replacing an impact modifier in the disclosed compositions with a more brittle impact modifier increases impact, disclosed herein are methods of increasing the impact of a polycarbonate composition comprising an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene polymer and polycarbonate blend comprising substituting all or a portion of a polycarbonate with high ductility with a brittle terpolymer, and wherein the starting polycarbonate composition further comprises PMMA, the method further comprises substituting all or part of the PMMA with poly lactic acid. Optional Composition Additives In addition to the first polycarbonate component, the second polycarbonate component, and the impact modifier, the polycarbonate compositions disclosed herein can further comprise one or more other materials or additives ordinarily incorporated in resin compositions of this type that can maintain and/or improve various properties of the resulting material, with the proviso that the additives are selected so as to not significantly adversely affect the desired properties of the polycarbonate composition.

In another instance triaryl phosphonate, phosphite compounds or mixtures thereof may be employed. Effective amounts of the additives vary widely, but they are usually present in an amount up to about 0.01-20% or more by weight, based on the weight of the entire composition. Flame retardants based on sulfonate salts, such a perfluoro alky metal sulfonates, aryl sulfonate salts or mixtures thereof, aryl phosphates and halogenated aromatic compounds may be useful.

Manufacture of Blended Polycarbonate Compositions In various aspects, the blended polycarbonate compositions of the present invention can be manufactured by various methods. The compositions of the present invention can be blended with the aforementioned ingredients by a variety of methods involving intimate admixing of the materials with any additional additives desired in the formulation. Because of the availability of melt blending equipment in commercial polymer processing facilities, melt processing methods can be used. In various further aspects, the equipment used in such melt processing methods includes, but is not limited to, the following: co-rotating and counter-rotating extruders, single screw extruders, co-kneaders, disc-pack processors and various other types of extrusion equipment. In a further aspect, the extruder is a twin-screw extruder. In various further aspects, the melt processed composition exits processing equipment such as an extruder through small exit holes in a die. The resulting strands of molten resin are cooled by passing the strands through a water bath. The cooled strands can be chopped into small pellets for packaging and further handling. The temperature of the melt is minimized in order to avoid excessive degradation of the resins. For example, it can be desirable to maintain the melt temperature between about 230° C. and about 350° C. in the molten resin composition, although higher temperatures can be used provided that the residence time of the resin in the processing equipment is kept short. In a still further aspect, the extruder is typically operated at a temperature of about 180° C. to about 385° C. In a yet further aspect, the extruder is typically operated at a temperature of about 200° C. to about 330° C. In an even further aspect, the extruder is typically operated at a temperature of about 220° C. to about 300° C. In various aspects, the blended polycarbonate compositions of the present invention can be prepared by blending the polycarbonate polymer composition, the impact modifier composition, and the SAN copolymer components in mixer, e.g. a HENSCHEL-Mixer® high speed mixer or other suitable mixer/blender. Other low shear processes, including but not limited to hand mixing, can also accomplish this blending. The mixture can then be fed into the throat of a twin-screw extruder via a hopper. Alternatively, at least one of the components can be incorporated into the composition by feeding directly into the extruder at the throat and/or downstream through a sidestuffer. Additives can also be compounded into a masterbatch desired polymeric resin and fed into the extruder. The extruder generally operated at a temperature higher than that necessary to cause the composition to flow. The extrudate is immediately quenched in a water bath and pelletized. The pellets, so prepared, when cutting the extrudate can be one-fourth inch long or less as desired. Such pellets can be used for subsequent molding, shaping, or forming.

Iso ter PC Isosorbide-bisphenol A polycarbonate- SABIC I.P. resorcinol terpolymer in the ratio of 50:25:25, respectively. Notched Izod impact (“NII”) was measured on 80×10×4 mm (length×wide×thickness) impact bars at 23° C. according to ISO 180, using a 5.5 Joule pendulum, and is reported in kilojoules per meter squared (kJ/m2). Heat deflection temperature (HDT) was measured according to ISO 75 on 80×10×4 mm (length×wide×thickness) injection molded bars. Tensile properties were tested according to ISO 527 on 150×10×4×mm (length×wide×thickness) injection molded bars at 23° C. with a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. Multiaxial impact was measured on injection molded 3.2 mm impact disks. Impact values are reported as maximum energy to failure in Joules (J) and % ductility. The impact velocity was 4.40 m/s and measurements were done at 23° C. The ISO 6603 test protocol was followed. The impact value is a good proxy for ductility. Various polycarbonate blends were tested for impact strength, tensile strength, and modulus according to the procedures described above. Reference Blend represents the standard polycarbonate blend comprising polycarbonate PC1 and PC2 (see Table I above for description of blend components). Samples Blends 1-3 comprise blends where all or a portion of the polycarbonate components have been substituted with the Iso ter PC. Sample Blend 4 further replaces polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) with poly lactic acid (PLA). Table 1 shows the wt % of each component based on the total weight of the composition blend (i.e. wt % for the total composition is 100%).

The data Table III compares the properties of the Reference Blend to with the Sample Blends comprising replacement of the PC1 with varied amounts of Iso ter PC (Sample Blends 1-3). Surprisingly, replacement of the ductile PC1 with a more brittle polycarbonate such as Iso ter PC increased impact energy, modulus, and tensile strength. At room temperature, the NII score increased from 36.4 kJ/m2 for the Reference Blend to 84.2, 65.9, and 47.6 kJ/m2 for Sample Blends 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The increase in NII was maintained at low temperatures. Additionally, tensile modulus increased from 2054 MPa in the comparator sample blend to 2147, 2194, and 265 MPa in Sample Blends 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Similarly, tensile strength showed a increase. For example, the data show an increase of at least 3 MPa when moving from the Reference Blend sample with a tensile strength of 48.0 MPa to samples 1, 2, and 3 which had tensile strengths of 51.7, 52.9, and 57.5 MPa, respectively. A similar increase was observed for the multi-axial impact strength (“MAI”). For example, the MAI score was 67.8 J for the comparator blend (Reference Blend) compared to 83.0, 96.5, and 101.0 J for Sample Blends 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Moreover, further replacing PMMA with the even more brittle PLA (Sample Blend 4), also provided an unexpected and surprising increase in impact energy and modulus (e.g. compare Sample Blends 3 and 4). The data show that substituting the PMMA in Sample Blend 3 with PLA in Sample Blend 4 resulted in an increase in NII at room temperature from 47.6 kJ/m2 to 61.7 kJ/m2, and tensile modulus increased from 2365 MPa to 2407 MPa. The change in MAI was more modest, with an MAI of 101.0 J for Sample Blend 3 compared to 102.2 J for Sample Blend 4.
