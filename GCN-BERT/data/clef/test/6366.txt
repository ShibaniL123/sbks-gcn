BACKGROUND 1. Technical Description The present disclosure relates to defibrillators and defibrillation electrodes and, more particularly, to systems and methods for hydrating defibrillation electrodes connected to a defibrillator prior to the electrodes being used on a patient. 2. Background of Related Art In many instances, when an emergency situation arises at a public location remote from a medical facility, Automated External Defibrillators (AED's) may generally be available for use on the individual experiencing the medical emergency. An AED is a portable electronic device that automatically diagnoses the potentially life threatening cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia in a patient, and is able to treat them through defibrillation, the application of electrical therapy which stops the arrhythmia, allowing the heart to reestablish an effective rhythm. Like many other medical devices, AED's include electrodes that generally have a conductor portion that is often covered or coated in a conductive gel/hydrogel to enhance the ability of the electrode to adhere to a patient's skin. However, an AED may be stored for prolonged periods which may cause the conductive gel/hydrogel to become dry to the point where its effectiveness is altered or compromised. In this respect, when an AED is stored for long periods of time, the conductive gel/hydrogel may lose its ability to adhere to a patient or may demonstrate excessively high contact impedance which, if used on a patient, can result in the patient being burned. Thus, a need exists for a system that prolongs the lifespan of the conductive gel/hydrogel used with defibrillation electrodes to minimize risks associated with AEDs that will be stored for long periods of time.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Embodiments of the presently disclosed automated external defibrillators will now be described in detail with reference to the drawing figures wherein like reference numerals identify similar or identical elements. As illustrated in FIG. 1, an exemplary automated external defibrillator is generally designated as 100. Automated external defibrillator 100 is configured to deliver electrical pulses and/or shocks to a heart of a patient during a cardiac emergency. Automated external defibrillator 100 includes a housing 102 and an electrode delivery system 110 supported by housing 102. Electrode delivery system 110 is configured to generate and deliver electrical pulses and/or shocks (e.g., manually and/or autonomously as appreciated by one skilled in the art). Electrode delivery system 110 includes a controller 112, an energy source 114 (e.g., a battery), and circuitry 116 in electrical communication with controller 112 and energy source 114. Circuitry 116 may be configured for high voltage compatibility. Notably, any suitable combination of conductors, resistors, transistors, capacitors, inductors, etc. may be used to electrically couple any of the presently disclosed components described herein. With continuing reference to FIG. 1, electrode delivery system 110 includes a pair of electrode pads 120 that are electrically coupled to controller 112 and/or energy source 114 via lead wires 122 and an electrical connector 124 supported on or in electrical communication with a first end of lead wires 122. In this regard, electrical connector 124 electrically couples lead wires 122 and circuitry 116 to electrically couple controller 112 and/or energy source 114 to electrode pads 120 to deliver electrical pulses and/or shocks. The pair of electrode pads 120 are supported on or in electrical communication with a second end of lead wires 122. As illustrated in FIGS. 2-3, an automated external defibrillator according to one embodiment of the present disclosure is generally referred to as 200. Automated external defibrillator 200 is similar to automated external defibrillator 100 and is described herein only to the extent necessary to describe the differences in construction and operation thereof. Automated external defibrillator 200 includes a housing 202 that supports an electrode delivery system 110 and a hydrating system 210. Electrode pads 120 are pre-connected to controller 112 and/or energy source 114 such that electrode pads 120 are in electrical communication with controller 112 and/or energy source 114. Electrode pads 120 may be fixedly pre-connected to controller 112 and/or energy source 114. In order to facilitate the deliverance of electrical pulses and/or shocks to a patient, a hydrogel 120a (or other suitable material; e.g., a foam) is supported on electrode pads 120 of electrode delivery system 110. Hydrogel 120a enhances the ability of electrode pads 120 to adhere to a patient's skin when delivering electrical pulses and/or shocks generated by controller 112 and/or energy source 114. With continuing reference to FIGS. 2-3, hydrating system 210 is configured to reduce a moisture vapor transmission rate (i.e., tendency to dry-out) of hydrogel 120a of electrode pads 120 without the need for special packaging of electrode pads 120. In this regard, electrode pads 120 may be pre-connected to controller 112 and/or energy source 114 to hasten the usability of electrode pads 120 by eliminating the need to open packaging and and/or the need to electrically connect electrode pads 120 to controller 112 and/or energy source 114 at the time of a cardiac emergency. As depicted in FIGS. 2-3, hydrating system 210 includes a fluid container 230 and a mesh 240 overlying fluid container 230. Fluid container 230 may be supported on and/or within housing 202. A fluid “F” (e.g., water, saline, etc.) suitable to hydrate hydrogel 120a of electrode pads 120 is contained in fluid container 230. Mesh 240 may be supported on housing 202 and/or fluid container 230 such that mesh 240 is disposed in fluid communication with fluid “F” to enable the hydration of hydrogel 120a over a predetermined time period, when electrode pads 120 are supported on mesh 240, to prolong the effectiveness of hydrogel 120a. In particular, fluid “F” from container 230, hydrates hydrogel 120a of electrode pads 120. In an embodiment, mesh 240 may include a plurality of micro pores 242 to facilitate hydration of hydrogel 120a. It is contemplated that mesh 240 may include an fluid permeable material and may be selected such that a predetermined rate of fluid transfer is obtained therethrough that is sufficient to maintain hydrogel 120a at least substantially hydrated. As appreciated, after a predetermined time period, fluid “F” will diminish (see FIG. 3) as fluid “F” hydrates hydrogel 120a. In this regard, a refill conduit 250 may be disposed in fluid communication with fluid container 230 to enable one to refill and/or re-change fluid container 230 with fluid “F.” Turning now to FIGS. 4-5, an automated external defibrillator according to another embodiment of the present disclosure is generally referred to as 300. Automated external defibrillator 300 is similar to automated external defibrillators 100 and 200 and is described herein only to the extent necessary to describe the differences in construction and operation thereof. Automated external defibrillator 300 includes a housing 302 that supports an electrode delivery system 110 and a hydrating system 310 for hydrating a hydrogel 120a supported on electrode pads 120 of electrode delivery system 110. With continuing reference to FIGS. 4-5, hydrating system 310 is also configured to reduce a moisture vapor transmission rate of hydrogel 120a of electrode pads 120 without the need for special packaging of electrode pads 120. Hydrating system 310 includes a fluid container 330 and a sprayer system 332 with one or more sprayers 332a. Sprayer system 332 may be operably coupled to controller 112. Fluid container 330 may be supported on and/or within housing 302. A fluid “F”, suitable to hydrate hydrogel 120a of electrode pads 120, is supported in fluid container 330 and may be sprayed (see FIG. 5) via one or more sprayers 332a of sprayer system 332 directly or indirectly onto hydrogel 120a of electrode pads 120 to hydrate hydrogel 120a over a predetermined time period to prolong the effectiveness of the hydrogel 120a when electrode pads 120 are disposed adjacent sprayers 332a. In particular, sprayer system 332, may include any suitable mechanical, chemical, and or electrical component such as a motor (not shown) and/or controller that is operatively coupled to controller 112 to spray fluid “F” from sprayers 332a. Notably, sprayer system 332 may include independent components such as a controller, energy source, etc. to operate sprayer system 332 independent of electrode delivery system 110. Sprayer system 332 may be configured to continuously spray, to spray at periodic intervals, and/or to spray at random intervals. To this end, any suitable spray pattern and timing thereof is contemplated. Similar to refill conduit 250 above, a refill conduit 350 may be secured to sprayer system 332 to enable one to refill and/or change fluid “F” within fluid container 330.
