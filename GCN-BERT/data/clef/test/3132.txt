DETAILED DESCRIPTION It should, of course, be understood that the description and drawings herein are merely illustrative and that various modifications and changes can be made in the structures disclosed without departing from the scope of the appended claims. It will also be appreciated that the various identified components of the exemplary avocado pitting device disclosed herein are merely terms of art that may vary from one manufacturer to another and should not be deemed to limit the present disclosure. Referring now to the drawings, wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout the several views, FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate an avocado pitting device 100 according to one exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. The device 100 is dimensioned to be grasped by an average-sized adult human's hand. The avocado pitting device 100 generally comprises a housing 110 having an inner surface 112 which defines a recess 114. The recess 114 is configured to at least partially receive a pit of an avocado. As will be discussed in greater detail below, at least one engagement member 120 is secured to and projects from the housing inner surface 112. The engagement member 120 is configured to engage an exterior surface of the avocado pit and retain the avocado pit at least partially within the recess 114 such that the pit is removable with the housing 110 from the avocado. In other words, when the housing 110 is moved away from the avocado, the pit is retained by the engagement member(s) 120 at least partially within the recess 114. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the housing 110 includes a bottom wall 130 having an opening 132 in communication with the recess 114. The opening 132 is sized to allow an avocado pit to pass therethrough and into the recess. As depicted, the opening 132 is circular in shape; although, this is not required. For example, the opening 132 can be polygonal in shape; the only requirement being that the overall dimensions of the opening allows avocado pits of varying sizes to pass therethrough. The housing 110 can further include a finger insert 140 in communication with the recess 114 and the opening 132. The finger insert 140 is positioned at a location on the housing above the at least one engagement member 120 located on the inner surface 112. This provides access to the exterior surface of the avocado pit and allows a user to remove the avocado pit from the recess 114 with minimal force exerted on the pit. In the depicted embodiment, the finger insert 140 is defined by an opening 142 provided on a top wall 144 of the housing 110. The top wall opening 142 is in communication with the recess 114 and can be smaller in size compared to the bottom wall opening 132. In the illustrated embodiment, and similar to the bottom wall opening 132, the top wall opening is circular in shape and has a diameter less than a diameter of the bottom wall opening. However, alternative shapes and sizes for the top wall opening 142, and, in turn, the finger insert 140 are contemplated. In the illustrated embodiment, the top wall opening 142 is coaxial with the bottom wall opening 132 which allows a user to firmly hold the pitting device 100 as the avocado pit is removed via the finger insert 140. It should also be appreciated that with a top wall opening 142, the pitting device 100 can be a dual-sided pitting device allowing a user to engage the avocado pit via insertion of the pit through the bottom wall opening 132 or through the top wall opening 142. As indicated previously, the pitting device 100 includes the at least one engagement member 120 configured to engage the avocado pit and retain the pit at least partially within the recess 114 of the housing 110. For example, and according to one aspect, the engagement member 120 can be a barb adapted to penetrate the exterior surface of the avocado pit and attach the pit to the housing 110. In the depicted embodiment, the pitting device 100 includes at least two engagement members 120 angularly spaced on the housing inner surface 112 relative to a generally central axis CA defined by the recess 114. More particularly, the pitting device 100 includes at least three engagement members 120 which are equally angularly spaced from one another on the inner surface 112 relative to the central axis CA of the recess 114 and are aligned substantially parallel to the central axis. Thus, it should be appreciated that the present disclosure contemplates a pitting device 100 having a plurality of engagement members to dig into or pierce the exterior surface of the avocado pit and retain the pit to the pitting device 100. However, it should also be appreciated that the number or size of engagement members 112 projecting into the recess 114 should not restrict access to the recess 114. In other words, the number of engagement members 120 is such that the avocado pit easily enters the recess 114 while simultaneously being engaged by the engagement members 120. As best depicted in FIG. 1, the engagement members 120 are positioned adjacent the bottom wall opening 132 and project toward a central axis defined by the opening, which is coaxial with the central axis CA. Each engagement member includes a pointed end 122 for piercing the avocado pit as the pit extends through the bottom wall opening 132 and enters the recess 114. Preferably, the pointed ends 122 of the engagement members do not extend downward below the bottom wall 130. The engagement members can have conforming shapes and sizes, or different shapes and sizes. In the illustrated embodiment, the engagement members 120 have similar substantially triangular shapes, each engagement member including a bottom surface 150, a side surface 152 and a top surface 154. The side surface 152 is secured to or in contact with the inner surface 112 of the housing 110. The top surface 154 slopes from the side surface 152 toward an end of the bottom surface 150, and an uppermost edge of each engagement member 120 is spaced from the top wall opening 142. The bottom surface 150 is substantially contiguous with the bottom wall 130 of the housing 110. With this arrangement, the engagement members 120 project toward each other such that the engagement members 120 together define a space for receiving the avocado pit. According to one aspect of the present disclosure, the engagement members 120 are integrally formed with the housing 110; although, this is not required. It should also be appreciated that the shape or profile of the engagement members 120 is not limited to the depicted triangular shape and that alternative shapes, sizes and configurations are contemplated, the only requirement being that the shape of the engagement members allows for piercing of the avocado pit and retention of the pit to the pitting device 100. The avocado pitting device 100 can include a separate gripping member 160 which is secured to and substantially surrounds or encloses the housing 110. For example, the gripping member 160 can be connected to the housing 110 by overmolding, ultrasonic welding, by an adhesive, or by other known manners for attachment. The gripping member 160 is softer and more resilient than the housing 110 and, therefore, is configured to allow a user to easily handle the pitting device 100. The gripping member includes a first aperture 162 aligned with the top wall opening 142 such that the aperture at least partially defines the finger insert 140 and is in communication with the recess 114. The gripping member also includes a second aperture 164 aligned with the bottom wall opening 132. In the illustrated embodiment, the gripping member 160 is substantially dome-shaped; although, this is not required. Additionally, the inner surface 112 of the housing 110, and thus the recess 114, can be substantially dome-shaped which allows that housing to accommodate avocado pits of varying dimensions. As illustrated, the inner surface 112 defines a surface of revolution with respect to the central axis CA; however, this is not required. Alternatively, the inner surface 112 can have a profile, taken parallel with the central axis CA, which is polygonal in configuration. It should be appreciated that the components of the avocado pitting device 100 (e.g. the housing 110, engagement members 120 and gripping member 160) can be manufactured from FDA-approved food contact materials. For example, the housing 110 and engagement members 120 can be formed from stainless steel, hardened plastic, ceramic or the like. The gripping member, which as indicated above is more resilient than the housing 110, can be formed from plastic and can have a surface finish adapted for improved traction, particularly in wet food preparation environments. In use, the avocado is first cut substantially in half with a knife or other sharp implement. The pit typically remains attached to one of the separated avocado halves. The pitting device 100 is positioned over the avocado pit such that the bottom wall opening 132 is aligned with the pit. The pitting device 100 is then pressed onto the pit, which, in turn, forces the pit through the opening 132 and at least partially into the recess 114. As the pit enters the recess 114, the engagement members 120, which are at least partially located in the recess 114, engage the avocado pit by penetrating the exterior surface of the pit. Once engaged, the engagement members 120 retain the pit within the recess 114 such that the pit is removed with the pitting device 100 without mangling the fruit during removal. The skin is then removed and the fruit is then sliced for preparation and/or consumption. With reference now to FIGS. 3-6, an avocado pitting device 200 according to another exemplary embodiment comprises a handle 202 having a housing or protuberance 210 connected thereto and configured to at least partially receive a pit of an avocado. The handle 202 has at least two spaced apart engagement members 220 secured to and projecting from an inner surface 212 of the protuberance 210. Similar to the device 100, the engagement members 220 are configured to engage the avocado pit and retain the pit at least partially within the protuberance 210. A resilient gripping member 260 is secured to and substantially surrounds or encloses a portion of the handle 202. The gripping member 260 allows a user to easily handle the pitting device 200. As will be discussed below, a blade member is connected to the handle 202 and configured to cut and/or slice the avocado. The handle 202 includes a bottom wall 230 having an opening 232 in communication with an interior or recess 214 defined by the protuberance 210. The opening 232 is sized and shaped to allow avocado pits of varying sizes to pass therethrough and into the recess 214. As depicted, the opening 232 is circular in shape; although, this is not required. As shown, the recess 214 is substantially dome-shaped which allows for at least partial accommodation of avocado pits of varying sizes. The handle 202 further includes a finger insert 240 in communication with the recess 214. This provides access to the exterior surface of the avocado pit retained within the protuberance 210 and allows a user to remove the avocado pit from the device 200 with minimal force exerted on the pit. In the depicted embodiment, the finger insert 240 is defined by an opening 242 provided on a top wall 244 of the handle 202. The opening 142 is coaxial with the bottom wall opening 232 which allows a user to firmly hold the handle 202 and remove the avocado pit via the finger insert 240 with a single hand. As indicated previously, the pitting device 200 can include at least two engagement members 220 circumferentially spaced on the inner surface 212. Again, as indicated above, more or less than two engagement members 220 are contemplated. More particularly, the pitting device 200 includes three engagement members 220 which are circumferentially spaced equally from one another on the inner surface 212. As best depicted in FIG. 4, the engagement members 220 are positioned adjacent the bottom wall opening 232 and project toward a central axis defined by the opening 232. Similar to engagement members 120 of the pitting device 100, each engagement member 220 can be substantially triangular shaped having a bottom surface 250 that is substantially contiguous with the bottom wall 230 of the handle 202; although, this is not required. With particular reference to FIGS. 3 and 4, the handle 202 has a first end portion 270 and an opposite second end portion 272, the protuberance 210 together with the engagement members 220 being interposed between the first and second end portions. At least one of the first and second end portions 270, 272 has a blade member connected thereto. In the depicted exemplary embodiment, the blade member includes a first blade member or knife 280 and a second blade member or fan blade 282. The knife 280 is connected to and extends from the first end portion 270 of the handle 202. The knife is generally triangular in shape and includes a substantially planar body 290 having a first, relatively straight edge 292 and a second curved edge 294, the first and second edges converging to a pointed tip portion 296. The first edge 292 is configured to cut open the avocado to expose the pit, and in the depicted embodiment, the first edge 292 is at least partially serrated to provide a cutting surface suitable for breaking the skin of the avocado. The second edge 294 can be beveled or tapered to create an additional means for cutting for the avocado; although, this is not required. For example, the second edge 294 can be a dull edge of the knife 280. The tip portion 296 can be slightly curved to reduce the risk of cutting through the avocado skin while slicing the fruit therein. The fan blade 284 is connected to and extends from the second end portion 272 of the handle 202. In the depicted embodiment, the fan blade 284 is configured to slice the avocado in substantially equal dimensions. Particularly, the fan blade 284 includes a frame 300 and slicing elements 302 extending from a proximal end 304 of the frame 300 to a distal end 306 of the frame. The frame 300 of the fan blade 284 is used to peel the skin from the avocado while the slicing elements 302 simultaneously slice the fruit. In the illustrated embodiment, the frame 300 is formed by a band 310 having a generally oval shape such that the frame takes the form of the avocado. At least one edge of the band 300 is beveled or tapered to create a sharpened edge 320 to facilitate peeling of the skin from the avocado. The sharpened edge 320 and the overall shape of the frame 300 facilitate positioning and movement of the frame 300 between the peel, or skin, and the fruit of the avocado, thus cutting the fibrous matter that holds the peel to the fruit. The slicing elements 302 are generally evenly spaced apart from one another such that each slicing element 302 is substantially parallel to an adjacent slicing element 302. Even spacing of the slicing elements prevents build up of fruit residue and fiber at the proximal end 304 of the fan blade 284 and improves the ability to fully clean the fan blade. In the illustrated embodiment, the slicing elements 302 are formed by narrow ribbons that stretch across the frame 300. In the depicted embodiment, six slicing elements 302 are shown, although in other embodiments fewer or more slicing elements may be used. The slicing elements 302 can also be formed from a continuous wire which is strung back and forth across the frame 300, between the proximal end 304 and the distal end 306. Alternatively, the slicing elements 302 can be formed by a series of individual wires. Similar to pitting device 100, the components of the avocado pitting device 200 (e.g. the handle 202, housing 210, engagement members 220, gripping member 260, and first and second blade members 280, 282) can be manufactured from FDA-approved food contact materials. For example, the handle 202, engagement members 220 and first and second blade members 280, 282 can be formed from stainless steel, hardened plastic, ceramic or the like. The gripping member 260 can be formed form a resilient plastic and can have a surface finish adapted for wet food preparation environments. The frame 46 can be formed from stainless steel, hardened plastic or the like. As shown, the components of the pitting device 200 are integrally formed to define a unitary avocado processing tool. However, it should be appreciated that the first and second blade members 280, 282 can be separate members attached to the respective first and second end portions 270, 272 of the handle 202. In use, and with reference to FIGS. 7-12, the avocado A is first cut substantially in half with the first blade member 280. The pit P typically remains attached to one of the separated avocado halves H. The pitting device 200 is positioned over the avocado pit P such that the bottom wall opening 232 of the protuberance 210 is aligned with the pit P. The pitting device 200 is then pressed onto the pit, which, in turn, forces the pit through the opening 232 and at least partially into the recess 214. As the pit enters the recess 214, the engagement members 220 engage the avocado pit P by penetrating the exterior surface of the pit. Once engaged, the engagement members 220 retain the pit against the handle 202 within the recess 214 such that the pit is removed with the pitting device 200 without mangling the fruit during removal. The skin is then removed and the fruit is then sliced for preparation and/or consumption. To slice the avocado A, the sharpened edge 320 of the second blade member 384 is positioned between the avocado skin S and the fruit F. The second blade member 284 is pulled in an arc along the skin S such that the fruit F of the avocado A is sliced by the slicing elements 302 and the skin is cut away from the fruit by the sharpened edge 320 of the frame 300. The sliced fruit is pulled out of the skin by the slicing elements 302 and the skin falls away.
