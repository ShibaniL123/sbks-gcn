BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Diabetes mellitus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Chronically elevated blood glucose leads to debilitating complications: nephropathy, often necessitating dialysis or renal transplant; peripheral neuropathy; retinopathy leading to blindness; ulceration of the legs and feet, leading to amputation; fatty liver disease, sometimes progressing to cirrhosis; and vulnerability to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. There are two primary types of diabetes. Type I, or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is due to autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreatic islets. The onset of this disease is usually in childhood or adolescence. Treatment consists primarily of multiple daily injections of insulin, combined with frequent testing of blood glucose levels to guide adjustment of insulin doses, because excess insulin can cause hypoglycemia and consequent impairment of brain and other functions. Type II, or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) typically develops in adulthood. NIDDM is associated with resistance of glucose-utilizing tissues like adipose tissue, muscle, and liver, to the actions of insulin. Initially, the pancreatic islet beta cells compensate by secreting excess insulin. Eventual islet failure results in decompensation and chronic hyperglycemia. Conversely, moderate islet insufficiency can precede or coincide with peripheral insulin resistance. There are several classes of drugs that are useful for treatment of NIDDM: 1) insulin releasers, which directly stimulate insulin release, carrying the risk of hypoglycemia; 2) prandial insulin releasers, which potentiate glucose-induced insulin secretion, and must be taken before each meal; 3) biguanides, including metformin, which attenuate hepatic gluconeogenesis (which is paradoxically elevated in diabetes); 4) insulin sensitizers, for example the thiazolidinedione derivatives rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, which improve peripheral responsiveness to insulin, but which have side effects like weight gain, edema, and occasional liver toxicity; 5) insulin injections, which are often necessary in the later stages of NIDDM when the islets have failed under chronic hyperstimulation. Insulin resistance can also occur without marked hyperglycemia, and is generally associated with atherosclerosis, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and essential hypertension. This cluster of abnormalities constitutes the “metabolic syndrome” or “insulin resistance syndrome”. Insulin resistance is also associated with fatty liver, which can progress to chronic inflammation (NASH; “nonalcoholic steatohepatitis”), fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Cumulatively, insulin resistance syndromes, including but not limited to diabetes, underlie many of the major causes of morbidity and death of people over age 40. Despite the existence of such drugs, diabetes remains a major and growing public health problem. Late stage complications of diabetes consume a large proportion of national health care resources. There is a need for new orally active therapeutic agents which effectively address the primary defects of insulin resistance and islet failure with fewer or milder side effects than existing drugs. Currently there are no safe and effective treatments for fatty liver disease. Therefore such a treatment would be of value in treating this condition.

Use in Methods of Treatment This invention provides a method for treating a mammalian subject with a condition selected from the group consisting of insulin resistance syndrome and diabetes (both primary essential diabetes such as Type I Diabetes or Type II Diabetes and secondary nonessential diabetes), comprising administering to the subject an amount of a biologically active agent as described herein effective to treat the condition. In accordance with the method of this invention a symptom of diabetes or the chance of developing a symptom of diabetes, such as atherosclerosis, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, foot ulceration and cataracts, each such symptom being associated with diabetes, can be reduced. This invention also provides a method for treating hyperlipidemia comprising administering to the subject an amount of a biologically active agent as described herein effective to treat the condition. As shown in the Examples, compounds reduce serum triglycerides and free fatty acids in hyperlipidemic animals. This invention also provides a method for treating cachexia comprising administering to the subject an amount of a biologically active agent as described herein effective to treat the cachexia. This invention also provides a method for treating obesity comprising administering to the subject an amount of a biologically active agent as described herein effective to treat the condition. This invention also provides a method for treating a condition selected from atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis comprising administering to the subject an amount of a biologically active agent as described herein effective to treat the condition. The active agents of this invention are effective to treat hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease, cachexia, obesity, atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis whether or not the subject has diabetes or insulin resistance syndrome. The agent can be administered by any conventional route of systemic administration. Preferably the agent is administered orally. Other routes of administration that can be used in accordance with this invention include rectally, parenterally, by injection (e.g. intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intraperitioneal injection), or nasally. Further embodiments of each of the uses and methods of treatment of this invention comprise administering any one of the embodiments of the biologically active agents described above. In the interest of avoiding unnecessary redundancy, each such agent and group of agents is not being repeated, but they are incorporated into this description of uses and methods of treatment as if they were repeated. Many of the diseases or disorders that are addressed by the compounds of the invention fall into two broad categories: Insulin resistance syndromes and consequences of chronic hyperglycemia. Dysregulation of fuel metabolism, especially insulin resistance, which can occur in the absence of diabetes (persistent hyperglycemia) per se, is associated with a variety of symptoms, including hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, obesity, essential hypertension, fatty liver disease (NASH; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis), and, especially in the context of cancer or systemic inflammatory disease, cachexia. Cachexia can also occur in the context of Type I Diabetes or late-stage Type II Diabetes. By improving tissue fuel metabolism, active agents of the invention are useful for preventing or amelioriating diseases and symptoms associated with insulin resistance, as is demonstrated in animals in the Examples. While a cluster of signs and symptoms associated with insulin resistance may coexist in an individual patient, it many cases only one symptom may dominate, due to individual differences in vulnerability of the many physiological systems affected by insulin resistance. Nonetheless, since insulin resistance is a major contributor to many disease conditions, drugs which address this cellular and molecular defect are useful for prevention or amelioration of virtually any symptom in any organ system that may be due to, or exacerbated by, insulin resistance. When insulin resistance and concurrent inadequate insulin production by pancreatic islets are sufficiently severe, chronic hyperglycemia occurs, defining the onset of Type II diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). In addition to the metabolic disorders related to insulin resistance indicated above, disease symptoms secondary to hyperglycemia also occur in patients with NIDDM. These include nephropathy, peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy, microvascular disease, ulceration of the extremities, and consequences of nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins, e.g. damage to collagen and other connective tissues. Attenuation of hyperglycemia reduces the rate of onset and severity of these consequences of diabetes. Because, as is demonstrated in the Examples, active agents and compositions of the invention help to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetes, they are useful for prevention and amelioration of complications of chronic hyperglycemia. Both human and non-human mammalian subjects can be treated in accordance with the treatment method of this invention. The optimal dose of a particular active agent of the invention for a particular subject can be determined in the clinical setting by a skilled clinician. In the case of oral administration to a human for treatment of disorders related to insulin resistance, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, fatty liver disease, cachexia or obesity the agent is generally administered in a daily dose of from 1 mg to 400 mg, administered once or twice per day. For oral administration to a human the anticipated preferred daily dose of Compound AH is from 100 mg to 400 mg; of Compound AW is from 30 to 300 mg; and of Compound BI is from 10 to 200 mg. In the case of oral administration to a mouse the agent is generally administered in a daily dose from 1 to 300 mg of the agent per kilogram of body weight. Active agents of the invention are used as monotherapy in diabetes or insulin resistance syndrome, or in combination with one or more other drugs with utility in these types of diseases, e.g. insulin releasing agents, prandial insulin releasers, biguanides, or insulin itself. Such additional drugs are administered in accord with standard clinical practice. In some cases, agents of the invention will improve the efficacy of other classes of drugs, permitting lower (and therefore less toxic) doses of such agents to be administered to patients with satisfactory therapeutic results. Established safe and effective dose ranges in humans for representative compounds are: metformin 500 to 2550 mg/day; glyburide 1.25 to 20 mg/day; GLUCOVANCE (combined formulation of metformin and glyburide) 1.25 to 20 mg/day glyburide and 250 to 2000 mg/day metformin; atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg/day; lovastatin 10 to 80 mg/day; pravastatin 10 to 40 mg/day; and simvastatin 5-80 mg/day; clofibrate 2000 mg/day; gemfibrozil 1200 to 2400 mg/day, rosiglitazone 4 to 8 mg/day; pioglitazone 15 to 45 mg/day; acarbose 75-300 mg/day; repaglinide 0.5 to 16 mg/day. Type I Diabetes Mellitus: A patient with Type I diabetes manages their disease primarily by self-administration of one to several doses of insulin per day, with frequent monitoring blood glucose to permit appropriate adjustment of the dose and timing of insulin administration. Chronic hyperglycemia leads to complications such as nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, foot ulceration, and early mortality; hypoglycemia due to excessive insulin dosing can cause cognitive dysfunction or unconsciousness. A patient with Type I diabetes is treated with 1 to 400 mg/day of an active agent of this invention, e.g. 50 to 400 mg/day of Compound AH, in tablet or capsule form either as a single or a divided dose. The anticipated effect will be a reduction in the dose or frequency of administration of insulin required to maintain blood glucose in a satisfactory range, and a reduced incidence and severity of hypoglycemic episodes. Clinical outcome is monitored by measurement of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (an index of adequacy of glycemic control integrated over a period of several months), as well as by reduced incidence and severity of typical complications of diabetes. A biologically active agent of this invention can be administered in conjunction with islet transplantation to help maintain the anti-diabetic efficacy of the islet transplant. Type II Diabetes Mellitus: A typical patient with Type II diabetes (NIDDM) manages their disease by programs of diet and exercise as well as by taking medications such as metformin, glyburide, repaglinide, rosiglitazone, or acarbose, all of which provide some improvement in glycemic control in some patients, but none of which are free of side effects or eventual treatment failure due to disease progression. Islet failure occurs over time in patients with NIDDM, necessitating insulin injections in a large fraction of patients. It is anticipated that daily treatment with an active agent of the invention (with or without additional classes of antidiabetic medication) will improve glycemic control, reduce the rate of islet failure, and reduce the incidence and severity of typical symptoms of diabetes. In addition, active agents of the invention will reduce elevated serum triglycerides and fatty acids, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, a major cause of death of diabetic patients. Suitable daily dose ranges for selected compounds of the invention for treatment of NIDDM (either as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs) are from 50 mg to 400 mg of Compound AH, from 15 mg to 300 mg of Compound AW, or from 5 mg to 200 mg of Compound BI. As is the case for all other therapeutic agents for diabetes, dose optimization is done in individual patients according to need, clinical effect, and susceptibility to side effects. Hyperlipidemia: Elevated triglyceride and free fatty acid levels in blood affect a substantial fraction of the population and are an important risk factor for atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Active agents of the invention are useful for reducing circulating triglycerides and free fatty acids in hyperlipidemic patients. Suitable daily dose ranges for selected compounds of the invention for treatment of hypertriglyceridemia are from 50 mg to 400 mg of Compound AH, from 15 mg to 300 mg of Compound AW, or from 5 mg to 200 mg of Compound BI. Hyperlipidemic patients often also have elevated blood cholesterol levels, which also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Cholesterol-lowering drugs such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (“statins”) can be administered to hyperlipidemic patients in addition to agents of the invention, optionally incorporated into the same pharmaceutical composition. Fatty Liver Disease: A substantial fraction of the population is affected by fatty liver disease, also known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); NASH is often associated with obesity and diabetes. Hepatic steatosis, the presence of droplets of triglycerides with hepatocytes, predisposes the liver to chronic inflammation (detected in biopsy samples as infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes), which can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Fatty liver disease is generally detected by observation of elevated serum levels of liver-specific enzymes such as the transaminases ALT and AST, which serve as indices of hepatocyte injury, as well as by presentation of symptoms which include fatigue and pain in the region of the liver, though definitive diagnosis often requires a biopsy. As is shown in the Examples, compounds of the invention, e.g. Compound AW, reduce serum liver transaminases and liver fat content in an established animal model of NASH (ob/ob obese mice), and are therefore useful for treatment of fatty liver disease. An appropriate dose range of Compound AW for treatment of fatty liver disease is 15 to 300 mg/day. The anticipated benefit is a reduction in liver inflammation and fat content, resulting in attenuation, halting, or reversal of the progression of NASH toward fibrosis and cirrhosis.

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY EXAMPLES Example A Compound AH Improves Metabolic Abnormalities in Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Streptozotocin (STZ) is a toxin that selectively destroys insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, and is widely used to induce insulin-dependent diabetes in experimental animals. Female Balb/C mice (8 weeks old; 18-20 grams body weight) were treated with streptozotocin (STZ) (50 mg/kg i.p. on each of five consecutive days). Fourteen days after the last dose of STZ, blood glucose was measured to verify that the animals were diabetic, and the mice were divided into two groups of 5 animals each, one group receiving Compound AH (250 mg/kg) daily by oral gavage, and the other receiving vehicle (0.75% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, a suspending agent, in water). A group of nondiabetic mice from the same cohort that did not receive STZ were also monitored. Blood samples were taken periodically for determination of blood glucose concentrations, and body weights were also recorded. After several weeks of treatment, blood glucose concentrations in mice treated with oral Compound AH began to decrease toward baseline, whereas blood glucose in the vehicle-treated control animals continued to rise. Body weights and blood glucose, triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations 14 weeks after the beginning of drug treatment are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 Serum chemistries and body weights in streptozotocin diabetic mice treated with oral Compound AH for 14 weeks Glucose Triglycerides Cholesterol Body Weight Group mg/dL mg/dL mg/dL (g) Nondiabetic + 138 ± 6 88 ± 9 88 ± 6 21 + 0.6 Vehicle Diabetic + 615 ± 46 154 ± 16 133 ± 6 17.5 + 1.0 Vehicle Diabetic + 207 ± 12 62 ± 7* 82 ± 2* 21.7 + 0.8* Compound AH *= significantly different from STZ Diabetic group, P < .001 Oral Compound AH treatment resulted in significant amelioration of metabolic abnormalities associated with insulin-dependent diabetes. Example B Oral Compound AH Improves Survival of Mice with Lethal Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Female Balb/C mice (14 weeks old) were treated with a single dose of streptozotocin (175 mg/kg i.p.) to induce severe insulin-dependent diabetes. Seven days later, mice were divided into three treatment groups: Compound AH, pioglitazone, and vehicle. Mice were treated daily via oral gavage, and survival was monitored over time. TABLE 2 Survival at 12 weeks Groups Survivors Vehicle 0/5 Pioglitazone 30 mg/kg/day 2/5 Compound AH 250 mg/kg/day 4/5 All of the diabetic animals treated with oral vehicle died of severe, uncontrolled diabetes. Two of five animals treated with pioglitazone, an antidiabetic insulin sensitizer used to treat humans with noninsulin-dependent diabetes, were alive at 12 weeks, but had lost 15-20% of their body weight. Four of the five animals treated with oral Compound AH were alive at 12 weeks, and their body weights recovered and were maintained in the normal range. Example C Oral Compound AA Reduces Mortality in Severe Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Female balb/C mice (19 wks of age at start of experiment) were challenged with multiple high doses of STZ (75 mg/kg i.p. on 5 consecutive days). Animals were then divided in two groups (20 mice/group) matched for severity of diabetes. Four days after the last dose of STZ, treatments were initiated. One group received Vehicle (0.4 ml of 0.75% HPMC, p.o.), and the other group received oral COMPOUND AA (30 mg/kg/day). After three weeks of daily treatment, cumulative mortality in the Vehicle Control group was 19/20 mice. In contrast, only 5/20 of the COMPOUND AA mice died during this time. Example D Compound AH Reduces the Incidence of Spontaneous Diabetes and Mortality in NOD Mice A substantial proportion of NOD (“non-obese diabetic”) mice develop insulin-dependent diabetes as a consequence of spontaneous autoimmune destruction of pancreatic islet cells. Two groups of 20 NOD mice (6 weeks old) were treated daily with either oral Vehicle (0.4 ml of 0.75% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in water; HPMC) or Compound AH (200 mg/kg/day) suspended in HPMC. The incidence of mortality due to spontaneous development of severe insulin-dependent diabetes was monitored over a period of seven months. At the end of this time, 13/20 mice treated with vehicle had died of uncontrolled diabetes, whereas only 5/20 mice treated with Compound AH had died. Example E Compound AW Reduces Hyperglycemia and Hyperlipidemia, and Ameliorates Fatty Liver Disease in Ob/Ob Obese Diabetic Mice Ob/ob mice have a defect in the gene for leptin, a protein involved in appetite regulation and energy metabolism, and are hyperphagic, obese, and insulin resistant. They develop hyperglycemia and fatty liver. Male lean (ob/+ heterozygote) and obese (ob/ob homozygote) C57BL/6 mice approximately 8 weeks of age were obtained from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, Me.) and randomly assigned into groups of 5 animals such that body weights and blood glucose concentrations were similar between groups. All animals were maintained under the control of temperature (23 C), relative humidity (50±5%) and light (7:00-19:00), and allowed free access to water and laboratory chow (Formulab Diet 5008, Quality Lab Products, Elkridge, Md.). Blood glucose was routinely determined with glucose test strips and a Glucometer Elite XL device (Bayer Corporation). At selected time points, blood samples (˜100 microliters) were obtained with a heparinized capillary tube via the retro-orbital sinus for serum chemistry analysis. Serum chemistry (glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, BUN, creatinine, AST, ALT, SDH, CPK and free fatty acids) analyses were performed on a Hitachi 717 Analyzer, and plasma insulin and pancreatic insulin were measured by an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (Origen Analyzer, Igen, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). Groups of ob/ob mice were divided into treatment cohorts as indicated below, and given daily oral doses of Compound AW (10, 30, 100, 150 or 300 mg), rosiglitazone (1, 3, 10 or 30 mg), or pioglitazone (30 or 100 mg). The latter two compounds are insulin-sensitizing drugs used in the treatment of human patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, and are used as comparators for efficacy and safety of compounds of the invention. The dose ranges of compounds in this experiment were chosen to include both suboptimal and potentially supraoptimal doses. Compound AW produced reduction in blood glucose comparable to that achieved with pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, as shown in Table 3. At doses of 100 to 300 mg/kg/day, Compound AW reduced serum triglycerides and fatty acids better than did either rosiglitazone or pioglitazone at their optimum antihyperglycemic doses.

In NASH, fat accumulation increases the susceptibility of the liver to inflammatory injury. One characteristic sign of NASH in patients is, in the absence of viral infection or alcoholism, elevated levels in serum of enzymes that are released from damaged hepatocytes, e.g. alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH). These enzymes are elevated in ob/ob mice as a consequence of fatty liver and secondary inflammation. In Table 4, ALT, AST, and SDH in serum samples from mice treated with Compound AW, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone are shown, as are enzyme levels in serum from normal lean mice and from diabetic control mice treated only with vehicle. ALT, AST and SDH are significantly elevated in obese diabetic ob/ob mice compared to lean mice. Compound AW treatment at doses ranging from 30 mg/kg/day to 300 mg/kg/day resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in serum liver enzymes. In contrast, pioglitazone (30 and 100 mg/kg/day) and rosiglitazone (1 to 30 mg/kg/day) induced an elevation in ALT and AST and did not change SDH. The serum liver enzyme profiles correlated with liver histology. Vehicle-treated ob/ob obese diabetic mice had marked fat accumulation in the liver in discrete intracellular droplets. Daily Compound AW treatment for 4 weeks caused a marked reduction in liver fat droplets, whereas neither pioglitazone nor rosiglitazone reduced the size or density of fat droplets in the hepatocytes.

Male ob/ob diabetic mice were randomized into groups of five animals each. Body weights were 50-55 g and blood glucose was approximately 300 mg/dL in the fed state. A single oral dose of a test substance suspended in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose vehicle was administered by gavage. Blood glucose was measured in blood droplets obtained by nicking a tail vein with a razor using glucometer test strips and a Glucometer Elite XL device (Bayer) at 0, 0.5, 2, 4, 6 and 18 hours after the initial dosing. A 10% reduction in blood glucose versus oral vehicle is considered a positive screening result. Blood glucose reductions were generally maximal at 6 hours after drug administration.

Male ob/ob mice (50-55 grams; blood glucose ˜300 mg/dL) were divided into groups of five animals each, and given a single oral dose of test drug (250 mg/kg) suspended in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose vehicle; a control group received oral vehicle alone. Six hours after oral administration of test drugs or vehicle (control), blood samples were obtained from a tail vein and glucose content was determined with a glucometer.

Example H Antidiabetic Effects of Compounds of the Invention in Db/Db Mice Db/db mice have a defect in leptin signaling, leading to hyperphagia, obesity and diabetes. Moreover, unlike ob/ob mice which have relatively robust islets, their insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells undergo failure during chronic hyperglycemia, so that they transition from hyperinsulinemia (associated with peripheral insulin resistance) to hypoinsulinemic diabetes. Male db/db mice were given daily oral treatments with vehicle (0.75% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose) or antidiabetic compounds as indicated below. Blood samples were obtained via the retro-orbital sinus for serum chemistry analysis, or via the tail vein for glucose measurement with a test strip and glucometer. After four weeks of daily oral dosing, Compound AW and Compound BH elicited a significant reduction in blood glucose. While pioglitazone did initially reduce blood glucose over the first 3 weeks, its activity had largely failed at the 4 week time point and thereafter. The dose of pioglitazone used in this experiment was reported in the literature to be a maximally-effective dose for treatment of db/db mice (Shimaya et al. (2000), Metabolism 49:411-7).

After 8 weeks of treatment, blood glucose and triglycerides were significantly lower in animals treated with either Compound BI or rosiglitazone, compared to vehicle-treated controls. The rosiglitazone dose used in this study was reported in published literature as the optimum dose for late stage db/db mice (Lenhard et al., (1999) Diabetologia 42:545-54). Groups consisted of 6-8 mice each.

Moreover, unlike ob/ob mice on a C57BL/6J background, db/db mice on a C57BL/KS background undergo failure of their insulin-producing pancreatic islet 13 cells, resulting in progression from hyperinsulinemia (associated with peripheral insulin resistance) to hypoinsulinemic diabetes. Male obese (db/db homozygote) C57BL/Ksola mice approximately 8 weeks of age, were obtained from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, Me.) and randomly assigned into groups of 5-7 animals such that the body weights (50-55 g) and serum glucose levels (≧300 mg/dl in fed state) were similar between groups; male lean (db/+ heterozygote) mice served as cohort controls. A minimum of 7 days was allowed for adaptation after arrival. All animals were maintained under controlled temperature (23° C.), relative humidity (50±5%) and light (7:00-19:00), and allowed free access to standard chow (Formulab Diet 5008, Quality Lab Products, Elkridge, Md.) and water. Treatment cohorts were given daily oral doses of (1% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), Compounds BI, BO, BP, BQ or BR for 2 weeks. At the end of the treatment period 100 μl of venous blood was withdrawn in a heparinized capillary tube from the retro-orbital sinus of db/db mice for serum chemistry analysis. Effects of compounds of the invention on nonfasting blood glucose are shown in Table 10; effects on serum triglycerides and free fatty acids are shown in Table 11.

These rats, however, undergo cataractogenesis typically between 14-16 weeks of age. Male ZDF rats and their aged-match Zucker lean (ZL) counterparts (fat+ or +/+) were obtained from Genetic Models, Inc. (Indianapolis, Ind.) aged 12 weeks and acclimatized for 1 week prior to study. All animals were maintained under controlled temperature (23° C.), relative humidity (50±5%) and light (7:00-19:00), and allowed free access to standard chow (Formulab Diet 5008, Quality Lab Products, Elkridge, Md.) and tap water ad libitum. Treatment cohorts were given a daily oral dose of vehicle and 100 mg/kg of BI or BH for 10 weeks. Body weights and blood glucose were routinely determined (once a week, usually around 10:00 A.M.) from tail bleeds with glucose test strips and a Glucometer Elite XL device (Bayer Corporation). At the end of the treatment period 100 μl of venous blood was collected (usually 10:00 A.M.) in a heparinized tube from the tail vein for serum chemistry analysis (Anilytics, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). Serum chemistry (glucose (GL), triglycerides (TG), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH), and free fatty acids (FFA)) analyses were performed on a Hitachi 717 Analyzer (Anilytics, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). Plasma insulin was measured by an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay, ECL (Origen Analyzer, Igen, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.). The animals were sacrificed and tissues and/or organs (lens and liver) were extirpated, weighed (wet weight) and processed for biochemical analyses. Malondialdehyde (MDA), a major product of lipid peroxidation was assayed in lenses according to Ohkawa et al (1979), Analytical Biochem 95, 351-358). Table 14 shows the incidence of visible cataracts in the eyes of the ZDF rats. Table 15 indicates additional quantitative indices of cataractogenesis in the same animals.

Example L Oral BI and BL Lower Circulating Triglycerides, Free Fatty Acids, Insulin and Leptin in High Fat-Fed C57B1/6J Mice The high fat-fed mouse is a model for the hypertriglyceridemia and high circulating fatty acid levels, and the insulin and leptin resistance that are found in people at risk for and with obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other disorders. Male C57B1/6J mice, approximately 8 weeks of age, were randomly assigned into groups of 6 animals. They were maintained under controlled temperature (23° C.), relative humidity (50±5%) and light (7:00-19:00), and allowed free access to food and water ad libitum. Mice were fed a high-fat diet (diet number D12451, containing 45% of calories as fat (Research Diets, New Brunswick, N.J.)) for 6 weeks. After the 6 weeks, groups of mice received either vehicle (hydroxymethylcellulose), BI, BL, Wy14,643 or rosiglitazone by oral gavage at the indicated doses for an additional 4 weeks while continuing on the high-fat diet. Plasma chemistries (Anilytics, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.) were assayed after 2 weeks of drug treatments. Plasma serum insulin (FIG. 1) and leptin (FIG. 2) were measured by an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (Origen Analyzer, Igen, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md.) after 4 weeks of drug treatments. BI and BL were effective at lowering serum triglycerides and free fatty acids as well as insulin and leptin serum levels. Serum values from mice from the same cohort (“lean controls”) that were maintained on regular lab chow (Formulab Diet 5008, Quality Lab Products, Elkridge, Md.) are shown for comparison.

Sprague-Dawley rats have an intact leptin system and respond to a high fat diet with hyperinsulinemia due to a downregulation of the normal insulin response in peripheral tissues such as liver, adipose tissue and muscle Male Sprague-Dawley rats, approximately 17 weeks of age, were obtained from Jackson Labs (Bar Harbor, Me.) and randomly assigned into groups of 5-7 animals; the body weights were similar between groups. All animals were maintained in a temperature-controlled (25° C.) facility with a strict 12 h light/dark cycle and were given free access to water and food. Rats were fed a high-fat diet (diet number D12451 (containing 45% of calories as fat), Research Diets, New Brunswick, N.J.) for one month prior to drug treatment. Groups of 6 Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a single daily dose of vehicle (hydroxymethylcellulose), BI (10, 30 and 100 mg/kg), or rosiglitazone (3 mg/kg) for 6 weeks while maintaining the high-fat diet. At the indicated time points, blood samples (˜100 μl) were obtained via the tail vein for serum chemistry analysis. BI (30 mg/kg) reduced serum insulin, triglycerides; BI at all doses reduced free fatty acids.
