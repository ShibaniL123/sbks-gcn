To a stirred suspension of (E)-methyl 3-(2,4-difluorophenyl)acrylate (10 g, 50.5 mmol, 1.0 eq) in MeOH (100 mL) was added methyl cyanoacetate (5.9 g, 60.6 mmol, 1.2 eq), followed by drop wise addition of NaOMe 30% in MeOH (13.6 mL, 75.75 mmol, 1.5 eq) at RT. After addition was completed, resulting reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 2 h. The volatiles were evaporated under reduced pressure, diluted with toluene (100 mL) and washed with 1N HCl (50 mL), aq. NaHCO3 (50 mL). Organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure gave crude compound, which was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (100-200 mesh) using EtOAc/pet ether (2:8) as eluent to get dimethyl 2-cyano-3-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pentanedioate (10.0 g, 68%). TLC system: EtOAc/Pet ether (1:4); Rf: 0.3.
