42.2: 1-benzhydryl-3-methyl-5-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione
87 mg (2 mmol) of iron is added to a solution of 125 mg (0.3 mmol) of 1-benzhydryl-3-methyl-5-(6-methyl-1-oxy-pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione in 9.4 ml of acetic acid. The reaction mixture is heated at 70Â° C. in a sealed tube for 4 hours. It is filtered on Celite and then the filtrate is hydrolysed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate. The product is extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate, then with water and with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. 120 mg (100%) of 1-benzhydryl-3-methyl-5-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a beige solid.
