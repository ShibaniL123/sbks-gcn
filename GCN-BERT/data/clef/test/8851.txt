FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to specific sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, and more specifically to their use to treat muscle inflammation such as polymyositis and other inflammatory conditions such as dermatomyositis and nerve-muscle diseases e.g. muscular dystrophies and inclusion body myositis. BACKGROUND Polymyositis is an immune-mediated disorder leading to an inflammation of the muscles. It results in weakness that can be severe. Polymyositis is a chronic illness with periods of increased symptoms, called flares or relapses, and minimal or no symptoms, known as remissions. The therapy of such muscle inflammation diseases, and in particular polymyositis, is only partially effective, and in most cases only offers a short delay in disease progression despite anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive treatment. Accordingly, there is a need for agents which are effective in the inhibition or treatment of muscle diseases, e.g. polymyositis, including reduction of, alleviation of, stabilization of or relief from the symptoms which affect the muscles.

The invention provides forms of the compound that have the hydroxyl or amine group present in a protected form; these function as prodrugs. Prodrugs are compounds that are converted into an active drug form after administration, through one or more chemical or biochemical transformations. Forms of the compounds of the present invention that are readily converted into the claimed compound under physiological conditions are prodrugs of the claimed compounds and are within the scope of the present invention. Examples of prodrugs include forms where a hydroxyl group is acylated to form a relatively labile ester such as an acetate ester, and forms where an amine group is acylated with the carboxylate group of glycine or an L-amino acid such as serine, forming an amide bond that is particularly susceptible to hydrolysis by common metabolic enzymes. When the compounds of Formula Ia or Ib have asymmetric centers in the molecule, various optical isomers are obtained. The present invention also encompasses enantiomers, racemates, diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Moreover, when the compounds of Formula Ia or Ib include geometric isomers, the present invention embraces cis-compounds, trans-compounds and mixtures thereof. Similar considerations apply in relation to starting materials exhibiting asymmetric carbon atoms or unsaturated bonds as mentioned above. Compounds of Formula Ia or Ib can exist in free form or in salt form, e.g. addition salts with inorganic or organic acids. Where hydroxyl groups are present, these groups can also be present in salt form, e.g. an ammonium salt or salts with metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, zinc or magnesium, or a mixture thereof. Compounds of Formula Ia or Ib and their salts in hydrate or solvate form are also part of the invention. A preferred compound of formula Ia is e.g. 1-{4-[1-(4-cyclohexyl-3-trifluoromethyl-benzyloxyimino)-ethyl]-2-ethyl-benzyl}-azetidine-3-carboxylic acid (Compound A), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof. Unless otherwise stated, alkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl or alkynyl may be straight or branched. Halo or halogen means F, Cl, Br or I, preferably F or Cl. Halo-substituted alkyl groups and compounds can be partially halogenated or perhalogenated, whereby in the case of multiple halogenation, the halogen substituents can be identical or different. A preferred perhalogenated alkyl group is for example trifluoromethyl or trifluoromethoxy. Any double bonds can be in the cis- or trans-configuration. “Alkynyl” as a group and as structural element of other groups and compounds contains at least one C≡C triple bond and can also contain one or more C═C double bonds, and can, so far as possible, be either straight-chain or branched. Any cycloalkyl group, alone or as a structural element of other groups can contain from 3 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably from 3 to 6 carbon atoms. “Alkylene” and “alkenylene” are divalent radicals derived from “alkyl” and “alkenyl” groups, respectively. In this application, any alkyl group of R1 can be optionally interrupted by a member of the group selected from —S—, —S(O)—, —S(O)2—, —NR20— and —O— (wherein R20 is hydrogen or C1-6alkyl). These groups include —CH2—O—CH2—, —CH2—S(O)2—CH2—, —(CH2)2—NR20—CH2—, —CH2—O—(CH2)2—, and the like. “Aryl” means a monocyclic or fused bicyclic aromatic ring assembly containing six to ten ring carbon atoms. For example aryl, e.g. C6-10aryl, can be phenyl, biphenyl or naphthyl, such as phenyl or naphthyl, preferably phenyl. A fused bicyclic ring can be partially saturated, for example, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalene, and the like. “Heteroaryl” means aryl, as defined in this application, with the addition of at least one heteroatom moiety selected from N, O or S, and each ring is comprised of 5 to 6 ring atoms, unless otherwise stated. For example, C2heteroaryl includes oxadiazole, triazole, and the like. C9heteroaryl includes quinoline, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline, and the like. C2-9heteroaryl as used in this application includes thienyl, pyridinyl, furanyl, isoxazolyl, benzoxazolyl or benzo[1,3]dioxolyl, preferably thienyl, furanyl or pyridinyl. A fused bicyclic heteroaryl ring system can be partially saturated, for example, 2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoline, and the like.

In Vitro: Effect on Cytokine-Induced Atrophy of Primary Human Myotubes. Human skeletal muscle (skMC) cells are obtained from Cambrex (#CC-2561). For experiments skMC stocks are thawed and maintained in SkBM (Lonza CC-3161) containing 20% FCS and 0.1% gentamycin at 37° C., 5% CO2. After 4-5 days cells are seeded for experiments onto six-well plates coated with matrigel (450,000/well) and grown at 37° C., 5% CO2 for one day. Cells are then washed 3× with SkBM and differentiated into myotubes with SkBM containing 1 μM SB431542 (ALK4/5 inhibitor; Sigma #S4317) for 4 days (SB431542 is removed 24 h prior cell treatment). Myotubes are then treated with test compound either in the absence or in the presence of a cytokine cocktail (TNFα 10 ng/ml, IL-1β 2 ng/ml, IFNγ 10 ng/ml) for 24 h in SkBM plus 0.1% gentamycin, washed once with CSB buffer: 80 mM pipes, 5 nM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl 6H20 and 4% PEG35000 (Fluka #94646) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences #15714) in CSB for 15 min at room temperature. Cells are then rinsed with CSB, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Merk #1.12298.0100) for 20 min at room temperature, rinsed with CSB and blocked with 10% normal goat serum blocking solution (Zymed Laboratories #50-062Z) for 20 min at room temperature. Primary antibody (anti-myosin heavy chain antibody; Upstate #05-716) diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 1.5% goat serum is added for 1 h at room temperature. Myotubes are then washed 2× with CSB (5 min/wash) then add secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 F(ab′); Invitrogen #A11017) diluted 1:750 in PBS is added for 1 h at room temperature. Myotubes are washed once with CSB (10 min) then with PBS (Invitrogen #14190) and double distilled water. Finally, ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen #P36931) is added and myotubes are photographed. Average diameters of at least 40 myotubes are measured for each condition at three points separated by 50 μm along the length of the myotube. Human primary myoblasts, differentiated for 4 days and treated with cytokine cocktail for 24 h, fixed, and assayed for changes in myotube diameters show distinct atrophic phenotype with an approx. 20% decrease in myotube diameter as compared to vehicle control. Addition of Compound A at a concentration of 1 nM is sufficient to block almost completely the cytokine-induced atrophy. Higher concentrations of Compound A exert the same effect. The results are shown in FIGS. 1(a) and 1(b). In vivo: controllable muscle-specific promoter system to up-regulate MHC class I in the skeletal muscle of mice, as described e.g. in K. Nagaraju et al (PNAS, Aug. 1, 2000, Vol 97, No. 16, p 9209-9214), the content thereof being included by reference. Briefly, mice transgenic for both a transactivator (tTA) under the control of a muscle creatine kinase promoter (T+) and the tetracycline-responsive element (TRE)-H-2Kb (H+) are used. In H+T+ mice, the binding of a tetracycline analog to tTA prevents transactivator from binding to the TRE region, thereby preventing target gene expression. Thus, the transgenic H-2Kb expression can be induced by removing the tetracycline analog and suppressed by administering it. Mice having only the tetracycline-responsive element (TRE)-H-2Kb (H+) serve as control. H+T+ mice develop clinical, biochemical, histological, and immunological features similar to human myositis. First signs of disease are muscle weakness (about 3 months of age in females, i.e. 2 months after transgene induction). Behavioral assays are used to measure developing muscle weakness (e.g. treadmill, RotaRod, open field locomotor activity, running wheel, grip test). Other readouts of the model include blood markers indicative for muscle damage (CK, GOT etc.), and histopathology and immunohistochemistry of skeletal muscle (incl. mononuclear cell infiltrate, CD3+ T cell infiltrate, ICAM, etc.). Application of compound in the therapeutic mode may start around 3 months of age in female mice (2 month after transgene induction), when first clinical signs of muscle weakness occur and may last e.g. for 2 months. Compounds are applied i.p., s.c. or via sirup drops into the mouth. Oral gavage is not recommended due to dystrophy of pharyngeal muscles. Groups of n=8 mice are used. Compounds are applied to mice having both transgenes, H+T+ and mice having only the tetracycline-responsive element (TRE)-H-2Kb (H+, control). Vehicle-treated animals are compared to compound-treated animals. Application of compound in the prophylactic mode starts from day of transgene induction. Both, therapeutic and prophylactic treatment mode can be combined with other therapeutics, like e.g. prednisone or comparable steroids. 1.
