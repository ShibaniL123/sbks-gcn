Compound 7-6 (1.50 g, 3.46 mmol) was dissolved in toluene (60.0 ml) and methanol (15.0 ml). The reaction mixture was heated to an external temperature of 80 Â°C and refluxed overnight. The next day, the resultant was concentrated and isolated by column chromatography (n-hexane/ethyl acetate (v/v) = 10/1) to give product 7-7 (yellow oil, 1.21 g,yield 86%).
