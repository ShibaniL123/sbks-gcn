(4) Preparation of 5-bromo-7-iodo-6-methylbenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-4-amine
5-Bromo-6-methylbenzo[d][1,3]dioxol-4-amine (2.9 g, 12.6 mmol) was dissolved in toluene (40 mL), and NIS (4.26 g, 18.9 mmol)and acetic acid (1.0 mL) were added. The resultant mixture was reacted at room temperature under stirring for 2 h. After the reaction, 50 mL ice water was added. After extraction with ethyl acetate (100 mLÃ—3), the organic phases were combined, washed with saturated NaCl aqueous solution, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtrated, and concentrated. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate=20:1) to obtain the product (2.4 g, yield: 53%).
