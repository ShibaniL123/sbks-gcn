PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION COMPRISING LAPATINIB FIELD OF INVENTION: The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, a process for preparing such pharmaceutical composition and use of the said pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of cancer more specifically advanced or metastatic breast cancer. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART Metastatic (also known as secondary or advanced or Stage IV) breast cancer occurs when breast cancer cells spread from the first (primary) tumour in the breast through the lymphatic or blood system to other parts of the body. The most common parts of the body that breast cancer spreads to are the bones, liver, lungs and brain. A diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer means that the cancer cannot be cured, although it can be controlled, sometimes for years. Metastatic cancer may be treated with systemic therapy (chemotherapy, biological therapy, targeted therapy or hormonal therapy), local therapy (surgery or radiation therapy) or a combination of these treatments. Although the outcomes of breast cancer have improved greatly over the past 20 years, dealing with recurrent and metastatic disease remains a significant and challenging medical problem, particularly in view of the high prevalence of the disease. Several drugs have been approved for the treatment of breast cancer over the years; one amongst them being lapatinib. Lapatinib is human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2/ERBB2) and epidermal growth factor receptor (HERl/EGFR/ERBBl) tyrosine kinases inhibitor. It binds to the intracellular phosphorylation domain to prevent receptor autophosphorylation upon ligand binding. Lapatinib is indicated in combination with capecitabine, for the treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptors 1 and 2) and who have received prior therapy including an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab. Further lapatinib is used in combination with letrozole for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses the HER2 receptor for whom hormonal therapy is indicated. Lapatinib is currently available under the brand name TYKERB® sold by Glaxosmithkline. Lapatinib is present as the monohydrate of the ditosylate salt, with chemical name N-(3- chloro- 4-{[(3-fluorophenyl)methyl]oxy}phenyl)-6-[5-({[2-(methylsulfonyl)ethyl]amino}methyl)-2- furanyl]-4-quinazolinamine bis(4- methylbenzenesulfonate) monohydrate. Lapatinib ditosylate monohydrate is structurally represented as WO2010099150 discloses a tablet composition of lapatinib wherein the tablet core comprises lapatinib and wherein the tablet composition is produced by a process which comprises the steps of granulating a mixture comprising said active ingredient and a starch, essentially in the absence of a cellulose, thereby producing granules of said mixture, ii) blending the granules produced in step with one or more extra-granular excipients to produce a granular blend, and iii) pressing the granular blend produced to form a tablet. WO2010023187 discloses a composition of lapatinib wherein lapatinib is present in an amount of more than 60% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. WO2006113649 discloses an oral composition of lapatinib and a binder, disintegrant, lubricant. The recommended dose of lapatinib is 1250 mg daily. Tablets comprising 250 mg lapatinib are sold under the trade name TYKERB®. Thus, the required dosage is comprised in five TYKERB® tablets that have to be administered orally once a day. One of the issues with lapatinib is that its pharmacokinetic properties are affected by the prandial status of a patient receiving the treatment, i.e. it exhibits a "food effect". In particular, the bioavailability or systemic exposure of lapatinib increases with food. Lapatinib AUC values were approximately 3 and 4 times higher (Cmax approximately 2.5 and 3 times higher when administered with a low fat (5% fat) or with a high fat (50% fat) meal respectively. As such, patients receive specific instructions to administer TYKERB® at least one hour before or one hour after a meal. This situation is unsatisfactory and inconvenient to the patients especially cancer patients since their medications usually consist of multiple drug regimen demanding the administration of large numbers of tablets or capsules often along with intravenous therapy. Further, these cancer patients often suffer from nausea and lesions of the oral mucosa. Therefore the oral administration of lapatinib may be hampered by factors such as emesis and ingestion and would ultimately lead to decreased bioavailability of lapatinib. Hence, it would be desirable to reduce the dosing regimen as well as nullify the food effect of lapatinib. Further, the resulting composition of lapatinib should be stable as well as exhibit optimal dissolution properties. However, these characteristics are often difficult to achieve with high concentrations of lapatinib. Additionally, common side effects associated with lapatinib therapy involve loss of appetite, nausea, diarrhea and skin problems. Less common side effects involve heart and liver problems which could be a cause of serious concern even though they are rare. Accordingly, there have been no prior arts disclosing the dosage and ease of administration of lapatinib thereby facilitating patient compliance. Hence, the currently commercialized dosage form and the recommended dose still do not address the unsolved tribulations of the lapatinib therapy. The inventors of the present invention have appreciated the above problems associated with prior art compositions comprising lapatinib and methods of treating patients with them. Attempts to address the prior art problems have lead the inventors of the present invention to develop a patient compliant pharmaceutical composition with technical advancement and economic significance.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION: Lapatinib is commercially available as a conventional film coated tablet formulation for the treatment of metastatic or advanced breast cancer in combination with capecitabine and letrozole. The required dosage is comprised in five lapatinib tablets that have to be administered once a day. Further, cancer patients are usually on a multiple drug regimen demanding the administration of large numbers of tablets or capsules often along with intravenous therapy. Patient compliance in such a regimen can be addressed by decreasing the number of tablets or capsules administered as well as the type of dosage forms that are administered, with due consideration to the bioavailability of the administered drug . The bioavailability of the drug cannot be compromised to meet patient compliance. The inventors have appreciated that the above criteria could be met by formulating a composition with a reduced or low dose such that it exhibits similar or increased bioavailability. Hence, lapatinib as an active pharmaceutical agent used for treating breast cancer, would be, preferred in an oral composition with a low dose provided in such a dosage forms which exhibit desired therapeutic effect and at the same time would ensure patient compliance. The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising lapatinib which would ensure patient compliance due to simplification of therapy, ease of administration, an acceptable dosing regimen, bioavailability and which nullifies the food effect. The low dose which would be lower than the usual or the conventional dose, required to produce equal or higher therapeutic effect, would also reduce the plausible side effects thereby leading to limit the risk caused to the patient. The term "lapatinib" is used in broad sense to include not only "lapatinib" per se but also its pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof. Suitable derivatives include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable hydrates, pharmaceutically acceptable anhydrates, pharmaceutically acceptable enantiomers, pharmaceutically acceptable esters, pharmaceutically acceptable isomers, pharmaceutically acceptable polymorphs, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, pharmaceutically acceptable tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable complexes etc. Preferably, lapatinib is present in the form of lapatinib ditosylate monohydrate. The term "low dose" or "reduced dose" as used herein refers to a therapeutically effective dose of lapatinib, which dose is less than the usual or the conventional dose required to produce equal or higher therapeutic effect. Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention, according to the present invention may be administered at least once a day to a patient in need thereof. More preferably the pharmaceutical composition of the invention is administered once a day such that the total daily dose administered to a patient is a dose which is less than the conventionally administered daily dose. Preferably, the composition of the invention comprises less than 1250 mg of lapatinib. More preferably, the composition of the invention comprises from about 100 mg to about 1200 mg of lapatinib. Most preferably, the composition of the invention comprises from about 200 mg to about 1100 mg lapatinib. Optionally, the composition of the invention comprises from about 400 mg to about 1000 mg of lapatinib or from about 600 mg to about 800 mg of lapatinib. The conventional dose of TYKERB®, the current trade name for lapatinib, is 1250 mg per day. Lapatinib is preferably present in pharmaceutical compositions of the invention in an amount of from about 15% to about 55% by weight of the composition. More preferably, lapatinib is present in the compositions in an amount of from about 25% to about 50% by weight of the composition. Most preferably, the lapatinib is present in an amount of from about 30% to about 45% by weight of the composition. The inventors of the present invention have further observed that the solubility properties of lapatinib are improved by nanosizing thus leading to better bioavailability and dose reduction of the drug. Nanonization of hydrophobic or poorly water-soluble drugs generally involves the production of drug nanocrystals through either chemical precipitation (bottom-up technology) or disintegration (top-down technology). Different methods may be utilized to reduce the particle size of the hydrophobic or poorly water soluble drugs. [Huabing Chen et al, discusses the various methods to develop nanoformulations in "Nanonization strategies for poorly water-soluble drugs," Drug Discovery Today, Volume 00, Number 00, March 2010]. The present invention thus provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising lapatinib in the form of nanoparticles.

The lapatinib particles may have a particle size distribution with a D90 not less than about700 nm, preferably less than 300 nm, optionally less than 100 nm. The present invention thus provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising lapatinib wherein lapatinib is in the nanosize range. The term "particle" as used herein refers to an individual particle of lapatinib, or particles of lapatinib, or lapatinib granules and/or mixtures thereof.
