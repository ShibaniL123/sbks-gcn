Field of the invention The invention relates to the field of cycling sport suits. The invention relates in particular to a cycling suit including a seat pad in the crotch area, and to a seat pad for the making of a cycling suit. Prior Art It is a known technique to provide cycling suits with a seat pad for a better protection and comfort of body parts in contact with the saddle of the bicycle. The seat pad may comprise a soft fabric piece, which is also termed cover, and a padding. The cover is fixed to the suit, for example by sewing, gluing or welding or another technique. The padding is normally in the form of two or more shaped pads fixed to said cover or to the cycling suit. According to known art, the cover has commonly a multi-layered structure, for example including a layer of a soft expanded material sandwiched between two fabric layers. There is a continuous effort to improve the performance and comfort of the seat pad, especially under intensive use, to meet the expectations of the users. It has been noted in this respect that the parts of the seat pad or of the cycling suit in contact with the genitals are of crucial importance. A proper support as well as a good thermal condition of the genital area in fact is crucial for comfort. In particular, the male genitals need a proper accommodation and efforts have been made to provide specialized embodiment of the seat pad for this purpose. Hence, a particular care has been dedicated to improve the comfort for the genitals of the user. EP-A-1972216, for example, discloses a cycling suit with anatomically shaped seat pad to shield and support the male genitals, in particular the scrotal area. EP-A-2514329 discloses a sleeve in the inner side of the crotch area, facing the body of the user to provide room for accommodation of the male genitals. Summary of the invention The invention is aimed to further improve the above prior art. The invention, in particular, is aimed to improve the comfort for the genitals, especially for a male user. The basic idea underlying the invention is to provide a portion of the seat pad which is specially dedicated to comfort of the genitals and, according to a preferred use, to accommodation of the male genitals. In this portion, the conventional multi-layered structure is replaced by a single layer of a skin contact textile. The term of skin contact textile denotes a fabric material suitable for direct contact with the skin. Accordingly, the aims of the invention are reached with a cycling suit comprising a seat pad located in a crotch area of the suit, where: the seat pad comprises a cover made of a shaped soft fabric piece fixed to the cycling suit,said cover has a multi-layered structure comprising at least a first layer, facing the inside of the suit so that it is contact with the skin when the suit is worn, an outer layer opposite to said first layer, and an intermediate layer, whereinsaid cover of the seat pad has a front portion located to accommodate the genitals when the cycling suit is worn, which is made of a single-layer skin contact textile. The multi-layered structure of the cover has normally three layers, including an intermediate layer sandwiched between an inner layer and an outer layer. The intermediate layer is normally made of a synthetic rubber foam, preferably perforated. The outer layer may also be perforated, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention. Preferably, said front portion has a rounded shape. In a preferred embodiment, a portion of the multi-layered cover is cut away and replaced with a suitable insert made of said skin contact textile. The seat pad normally includes and a padding fixed to said cover or to the cycling suit. The invention has the following advantages. The front portion of the cover, having a lighter structure than the rest of the seat pad, and with no foam, creates a sort of nest where the male genitals are properly stored. Furthermore, the single-layer front portion has a higher breathability than the rest of the seat pad and keeps the genitals cooler during intensive use. The inventive seat pad combines the conventional multi-layered structure, usually with an intermediate foam layer, with a lighter insert which is strategically located in the front of the seat pad and in correspondence with the genitals. The conventional structure provides the necessary support and resistance, e.g. to properly support the paddings, and the dumping effect due to the foam layer, while the lighter insert improves the comfort and breathability for the genital area. Another advantage is the overall weight reduction for the seat pad. Other aspects of the invention are a seat pad for a cycling suit and a method for making a seat pad according to the attached claims. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a portion of the three-layered cover is cut away and replaced with a suitable insert made of said skin contact textile. It should be noted that the term of cycling suit in this description and in the attached claims encompasses various items including at least a trouser portion having a crotch area, such as a bodysuit, a pair of trousers and the like. The invention is now elucidated in a greater detail with the help of the following detailed description, which is given for indicative and not limiting purpose. Brief description of the drawings Fig. 1 is a view of a cycling suit according to an embodiment of the invention. Fig. 2 is a top view of the seat pad of the cycling suit of Fig. 1. Detailed description Fig. 1 shows a cycling suit 1 including a seat pad 2 in the crotch area. The cycling suit 1 is made of a suitable elastic fabric, such as Lycra, and may have different forms, such as a bodysuit, a pair of trousers, and others, according to various embodiments of the invention and the intended use, e.g. winter or summer, male or female, etc. The seat pad 2 includes a soft fabric piece to form a cover 3. Said cover 3 is fixed (e.g. stitched) to the inside of the crotch area of the cycling suit 1. The seat pad 2 also comprises a suitable padding which for example includes a couple of pads 4 fixed to said cover 3. Fig. 2 shows a typical shape of a seat pad; said pad 2 may have a concave shell in the front and/or rear portion. The cover 3 has generally a multi-layered structure, for example including: a first layer, an intermediate soft layer, and an outer layer. The intermediate layer is normally a layer of a synthetic foam rubber and is preferably perforated. Said cover 3 includes a front portion 5 which is made of a single-layer skin contact textile, instead of the above described three layers. To this purpose, the process of manufacturing the seat pad may include the following basic steps: the provision of said cover 3 having an inner layer, and intermediate layer an outer layer,cutting away a front portion of said cover 3, leaving an aperture in the seat pad, andproviding an insert 10 of a skin contact textile over said aperture, fixing said insert to the cover 3. Said insert 10 can be fixed to the rest of the cover 3 with any technique such as stitching, gluing or thermal welding. The insert 10 is made e.g. of nylon or Lycra, polyester or a combination thereof. It may be appreciated that: the middle and rear portions of the cover 3, as well as the front boundary portion stitched to the suit 1, maintain the stronger three-layers construction; on the other hand, the front portion 5 where the three layers are replaced by the thin and light insert 10 provide optimum comfort, breathability and room for the genitals, especially for the male genitals. A cycling suit (1) comprising a seat pad (2) located in a crotch area of the suit, where: the seat pad comprises a cover (3) fixed to the cycling suit,said cover (3) has a multi-layered structure comprising at least a first layer, facing the inside of the suit so that it is contact with the skin when the suit is worn, an outer layer opposite to said first layer, and an intermediate layer,characterized in that: said cover (3) has a front portion (5) located to accommodate the genitals when the cycling suit is worn, which is made of a single-layer skin contact textile. A suit according to claim 1, said intermediate layer being made of a synthetic rubber foam, preferably perforated. A suit according to claim 1 or 2, said front portion (5) being obtained by cutting an aperture in the cover (3) and placing an insert (10) of skin contact textile over said aperture.
