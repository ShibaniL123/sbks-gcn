Example 3. Preparation of SM-3: 1,1-difluoro-2-oxo-2-(4-vinylphenylamino)-1-ethanesulfonyl fluoride
100 ml flask was charged with CH2Cl2 (24 ml) under nitrogen stream and allowed to equilibrate to 0Â° C. by stirring in an ice bath for 10 minutes, then 2-(fluorosulfonyl)difluoroacetyl fluoride (6.60 g, 37.6 mmol, 1.5 eq.) was added. After 20 minutes, a CH2Cl2 (12 ml) solution of 4-vinyl aniline (2.86 g, 24.4 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and pyridine (1.93 g, 24.4 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added drop wise to the mixture over 10 minutes. The mixture was allowed to warm to RT and was stirred for 4 hours at RT. 1N HCl was added to the final reaction mixture and the lower layer was separated and washed with 1N HCl and brine. The solution was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtrated and then CH2Cl2 was removed by an evaporator. The target compound was obtained as a white solid (6.57 g) in 96% yield.
