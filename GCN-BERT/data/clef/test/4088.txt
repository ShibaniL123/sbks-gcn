A boss is îormed on the end of each of the arms, and each of the bosses has a tapped recess formed therein on an axis which is substantially parallel to the axis of the bearing seat. An external relief I0 is formed in the end wall of the motor housìng for each of the tapped recesses» and the reliefs are circumferentially aligned with the respective recesses» such that the recesses are accessible externally of the molded motor housing. A plurality of screws are provided, one for each oî the tapped recesses, and each oî the screws pass through the molded end handle and through a respective relief in the end wall of the motor housing to engage its respective tapped recess, thereby securing the housings together. These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from a reading of the following specífication, taken in conjunction wìth the enclosed drawings, in which: ZO Figure 1 is a side elevation of a typical insulated portable electric tool with which the teachings of the present invention may find particular utility, part of the molded motor housing being broken away to illustrate the integrally-molded one-piece spider bearing insert: Figure Z is a section view taken along the lines Z-Z of Figure 1, and enlarged over the scale of Figure 1» to illustrate the spider bearing insert integrally-molded within the end wall o2 the molded motor housíng: Figure 3 is a section view taken along the lines 3-3 of Figure Z» showing the manner in which the annular hub of the spider bearing insert forms a seat for an anti-friction bearing; Figure 4 is a view taken along the lìnes 4-4 of Figure 1, enlarged over the scale of Figure 1, showing the substantíally planar face of the end wall oî the motor housing, and further showing the plurality of respective -ZZO reliefs formed in the motor housing for each of the tapped recesses formed in the arms of the spider bearing insert; and Figure 5 is a detail section view taken along the lines 5-5 of Figure Z» enlarged over the scale of Figure Z, and illustrating the interconnection between the end handle and the molded motor housing. With reference to Figure 1, there is illustrated a fully-insulated portable electric sander with which the teachings of the present invention may find partìcular utility. It will be appreciated and understood by those skilled in the art» however, that the teachings of the present invention are equally . applicable to a wide variety of tools and devices, and that the specific embodiment herein illustrated is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. With this in mind, the sander comprises a gear case 11 and gear case cover 1Z, a motor housing molded from a suitable insulating material, such as a glass-fiber reinforced polyester resin, the motor housing being secured rearward7 of the gear case cover, an end handle 14 secured to the motor housing in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, an electric line cord 15 entering the rear of the handle, a "paddle" type of switch 16 mounted within the end handle for energízlng the tooli a side handle 17 secured to the gear case for assisting in the manipulation and control of the tool, a tool spindle 18 drìven by the electric motor, an abrasive disc 18a (or other tool element) drìven by the spindle, and the one-piece spider bearing insert 19 of the present invention integrally molded within an end wall of the motor housìng. With reference to Figures Z, 3, 4, and 5, the spider bearing insert, whìch is integrally molded wìthin the end wall 13a oî the motor housing comprises an annular hub Z0 and a plurality of integrally-formed radiallyprojecting arms Z1 circumferentially spaced with respect to each other. Preferably, as shown in Figure 2, there are îour radially-projecting arms spaced at right angles to one another. each of the arms, and two of the arms, ledges Z3 adjacent to the annular hub. A boss ZZ is formed on the end of see Figure Z» have respective Each of the bosses has a tapped recess 74 formed therein along an axis which is substantially parallel to the bore Z5 i '730601 formed in the annular hub. The hub is provided with an inwardly-directed annular shoulder Z6 which forms a bearing seat Z7 rearwardly of the bore. Preferably, an axial clearance 28, see Figures 3 and 4, is provided between the annular shoulder and the end wall of the molded motor housing. The molded end wall has a rearward face 29, see Figure 4, which is substantially planar and is formed along an axis substantially at right angles to the axis of rotation• of the motor shaft. The end wall further has a plurality of external reliefs 30 íormed therein, one for each of the tapped recesses in the spider bearìng insert and circ trnferentially aligned with the respective recesses, such that the tapped recesses are accessible externally of the motor housing. A plurality of screws 24a are provided, one for each of the tapped recesses; and each of the screws, see Figures 3 and 5, pass through the end handle and through a respective relief in.the end wall of the molded motor housing to engage a respective tapped recess formed in the arms of the spider bearing ìnsert, thereby securing the two housings together. Preferably, a further relief 30a, see Figure 5, is formed in the motor housing for each of the recesses and forwardly thereof, such that a sufficient clearance and chip disposal is provided when the recesses 24 are tapped. Moreover, the end wall of the motor housing has a pair of holes 31 formed therein, see Figure 4, for the passage of the usual electrical conductors (not shown) which pass therethrough to the motor. The bore Z5 and bearing seat 27 are used to retain an anti-friction bearing 32, which is preferably of the ball type, and the bearing is used to journal the motor shaft 33. During the molding process, the annular hub may be partially fìlled with insulating material, but this is of no concern inasmuch as any excess materìal is removed in the subsequent process of machining the bore and the bearing seat. Moreover, the other housings, namely the gear case» gear case cover, and end handle, are preferably nolded from insulating materìal, while the entire tool is of the "double insulated" type of design. Obviously many modifications may be made without departing from the basic spirit. of the present invention, and therefore, within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced other than has been specifically described. ?30601 t . z The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: i.
