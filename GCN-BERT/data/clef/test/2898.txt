Synthesis of compound 12-c
At -78 °C, a solution of 2.5M n-butyl lithium in n-hexane (0.5mL, 1.17mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of compound 12-d (226mg, 0.9mmol) in anhydrous THF (10mL). The mixture was stirred for 1h, followed by adding trimethyl borate (142mg, 1.36mmol) dropwise, then slowly warming to room temperature, and further stirring for 16hrs, 1M HCl aqueous solution (5mL) was added. The organic phase was seperated, the aqueous phase was extracted with EA (30mL×3). The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give yellow solid 12-c (200mg, yield 100%). The product was directly used for the next step without further purification.
