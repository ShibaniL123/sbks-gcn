TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to 6-amino-9-[(3R)-1-(2-butynoyl)-3-pyrrolidinyl]-7-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-7,9-dihydro-8H-purin-8-one hydrochloride (hereinafter, referred to as the compound of the present invention), which has Btk inhibitory activity and is useful as a therapeutic agent for autoimmune diseases, cancer, and the like; crystals thereof; and a pharmaceutical composition containing the same. BACKGROUND ART Bruton's tyrosine kinase (abbreviated below as “Btk”) belongs to the Tec family of kinases, which are non-receptor tyrosine kinases, and is selectively expressed in the B cell and myelocyte lines. Btk plays an important role in signal transduction in B cells and is a factor that contributes to the survival, differentiation, proliferation, and activation of B cells. Signaling in B cells via the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) induces a broad range of biological responses, and abnormal signal transduction here causes abnormal B cell activation and the formation of pathogenic autoantibodies. Btk is believed to form a link in the BCR-mediated signal transduction pathways into B cells. Thus, X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is known to be caused by a defect in the human Btk gene that results in the induction of abnormal B cell differentiation and a drastic decline in immunoglobulin production (refer to Non-patent Document 1). The symptoms of this disease include a substantial decline in B cells in the peripheral blood and an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. Btk is also known to participate in mast cell activation and in the physiological functions of platelets. Due to this, compounds that have a Btk inhibitory activity are effective for the treatment of diseases in which B cells or mast cells participate, for example, allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, thromboembolic diseases, and cancers (refer to Non-patent Document 2). The following compounds are known as prior art for the compounds of the present invention.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The present invention is described in greater detail below. The term “Btk-selective inhibitory activity” means Btk-selective inhibitory activity with regard to tyrosine kinases other than Btk, particularly Lck, Fyn, and LynA. Due to this property, unexpected adverse reactions caused by inhibiting other tyrosine kinases can be avoided. In the present invention 6-amino-9-[(3R)-1-(2-butynoyl)-3-pyrrolidinyl]-7-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-7,9-dihydro-8H-purin-8-one (hereinafter, abbreviated as Compound A) means the compound represented by the following structural formula (in the formula, the symbol represents the β position). [Study of Acid Addition Salts of Compound A] Counter screening of acid addition salts of Compound A was performed by the following method using Compound A prepared in Example 8 below and various acidic counter ions. Amorphous powders were obtained by mixing a molar amount of Compound A with equivalent amount of each acidic counter ion; as step (I) methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was added to the mixture and the precipitate was scraped up with a micro-spatula, or as step (2), if no crystals precipitated in aforementioned step (1), methanol was added to the mixture, and it was allowed to dry naturally. When crystals were obtained by this screening method, the physical property data was measured under the conditions shown below. The physical property data for Compound A was acquired beforehand, and that was compared with the physical property data of the crystals obtained from the aforementioned counter screening process. [1] Powder x-Ray Diffraction Spectrum <Measurement Conditions> Device: BRUKER D8 DISCOVER with GADDS manufactured by Bruker AXS Target: Cu Filter: None Voltage: 40 kV Current: 40 mA Exposure time: 3 min [2] Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) <Measurement Conditions> Device: DSC 822e manufactured by Mettler Toledo Sample weight: 1 to 2 mg Sample cell: 40 μL aluminum pan Nitrogen gas flow rate: 40 mL/min Rate of temperature increase: 10° C./min (25 to 240° C.) The powder x-ray diffraction spectrum of the crystals of Compound A is shown in FIG. 1, and the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) chart is shown in FIG. 2, respectively. Moreover, Table 1 below shows the diffraction angle 2θ and the relative intensity in the powder x-ray diffraction spectrum. TABLE 1 Diffraction angle 2θ (degrees) Relative intensity (%) 5.88 100 10.31 6.3 10.56 8.4 11.47 7.8 11.84 9.7 12.63 5.1 13.60 21.4 15.55 45.8 17.11 57 18.44 14.9 19.74 11.7 20.40 41.2 21.03 7.4 21.76 10.1 22.39 14.3 22.77 10.1 23.48 3.5 24.00 4.5 Moreover, as shown in FIG. 2, the crystals of Compound A showed endothermic peaks corresponding to melting represented by an onset temperature of approximately 169° C. and a peak temperature of approximately 172° C. As shown in Table 2 below, the aforementioned screening was performed using 18 species of acidic counter-ions. TABLE 2 Acidic counter-ion Step (1) Step (2) Hydrochloric acid Amorphous Oil Sulfuric acid Amorphous Oil Acetic acid Amorphous Crystals Citric acid Amorphous Crystals (+)-tartaric acid Oil Crystals Phosphoric acid Amorphous Crystals Fumaric acid Amorphous Crystals Lactic acid Oil Crystals Succinic acid Oil Crystals Methanesulfonic acid Amorphous Oil p-toluenesulfonic acid Amorphous Oil Benzenesulfonic acid Amorphous Oil (−)-camphorsulfonic acid Amorphous Oil (+)-camphorsulfonic acid Amorphous Oil 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid Oil Oil 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid Oil Crystals Benzoic acid Oil Crystals Nicotinic acid Nicotinic acid Crystals crystals As a result, any crystals did not form a precipitate in step (1), meanwhile although crystals were obtained from 10 species of acidic counter-ions (acetic acid, citric acid, (+)-tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, benzoic acid, and nicotinic acid) in step (2), these crystals all matched the powder x-ray diffraction spectral chart of the crystal of Compound A, so it was clear that no salts were formed thereby. On the other hand, a crystalline powder was not obtained from the remaining 8 species of acidic counter-ions (hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfoinic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, (−)-camphorsulfonic acid, (+)-camphorsulfonic acid and 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid), but because crystals of Compound A did not precipitate, it appeared that salts had been formed. As a result, the following crystallization study was carried out on these 8 species of acidic counter-ions. [Crystallization Study of Salts of Compound A] A crystallization study of the salts of Compound A was carried out with an automatic crystallization device (Core Module X manufactured by Freeslate, Inc.) using sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, and p-toluenesulfonic acid as the acidic counter-ions, and methanol, 2-propanol, acetone, toluene, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, MTBE, and n-pentane as the solvents. For the crystallization methods, four conditions were established, i.e. the slurry method (50° C., natural cooling to room temperature), the chilling method (50° C. to 10° C., decrease of −10° C./hour), precipitation method (dissolution at 50° C. followed by precipitation at room temperature), and the evaporation enrichment method (dissolution at 50° C. followed by evaporation at room temperature), and by combining the solvent and crystallization methods a total of 72 crystallization conditions were established for each salt. As a result, however, a crystalline powder could not be obtained from any of the salts. On the other hand, when a similar crystallization study was carried out using hydrochloric acid as the acidic counter-ion, if 1,2-dimethoxy ethane (DME) was used as the solvent a crystalline powder was obtained. When a powder x-ray diffraction measurement of the said crystalline powder was performed under the aforementioned conditions, the peak shape was different from that of the crystals of Compound A, and the results of 1H-NMR and elemental analysis revealed these crystals were the hydrochloride of Compound A. Moreover, it was learned that because the powder x-ray diffraction spectral patterns match, crystals of the hydrochloride of Compound A can be obtained even with the method of Example 9 below. The powder x-ray diffraction spectrum of the crystals of the compound prepared in Example 9 is shown in FIG. 3, and the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) chart is shown in FIG. 4. Moreover, Table 3 below shows the diffraction angle 2θ and the relative intensity in the powder x-ray diffraction spectrum. Among these, the 2θ angles showed characteristic peaks at 8.11, 8.43, 14.20, 14.67, 14.91, and 23.21 degrees.

First 5 μL/well of either a solution prepared by diluting the test compound in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or DMSO alone was added to the wells of a 96-well assay plate together with 10 μL/well of substrate/enzyme mixture and allowed to react for 20 minutes at 30° C. The substrate/enzyme mixture solutions were prepared by dilution in kinase buffer (DL-dithiothreitol (DTT; 2.7 mM) and 1.33× kinase buffer) so that the final concentration of Tyr-1 peptide would be 4 μM, and the final concentration of Btk would be 5 nM. Next 5 μL/well of adenosine triphosphate was added (ATP; final concentration 36 μM) and reacted for 1 hour at 30° C. After the reaction was completed, 10 μL of development solution prepared by diluting development reagent B in development buffer 128-fold was added and reacted for an additional 1 hour at 30° C. Then the enzyme reaction was stopped by adding 10 μL of stop solution. The fluorescence intensity in each well was measured using a fluorescence plate reader (Fusion Universal Microplate Analyzer, PerkinElmer, Inc.) at 520 nm and 445 nm. In accordance with the instructions accompanying the kit, the phosphorylation rate was determined by the ratio of the emission at 445 nm (coumalin emission) in relation to emission at 520 nm (fluorescein emission). The inhibition (%) was calculated from the following formula. [in-line-formulae]Phosphorylation inhibition rate(%)=1−{(AC−AX)/(AC−AB)}×100 [Mathematical Formula 1][/in-line-formulae] AX: Phosphorylation rate when test compound was added AB: Phosphorylation rate without ATP (blank) AC: Phosphorylation rate with DMSO alone (control) The 50% inhibition rate of the test compound (IC50 value) was calculated from an inhibition curve based on the rate of inhibition at each concentration of the test compound. Measurements of the inhibitory activity on other kinases were made in the same manner as described above using various kinases such as Lck, Fyn, LynA (Invitrogen Corporation) in place of Btk. Results revealed that the IC50 value of the compound prepared in Example 9 was 0.0021 μM. In addition, Btk-selective inhibitory activity rates of the compound prepared in Example 9 toward other kinases, particularly Lck, Fyn, and LynA, were calculated on the basis of the IC50 values for each kinase, and these are shown in Table 4 below. TABLE 4 Lck[IC50]/ Fyn[IC50]/ LynA[IC50]/ Btk[IC50] Btk[IC50] Btk[IC50] Example 9 375 1057 1662 Results show that the compound of the present invention not only has Btk inhibitory activity, but also has Btk-selective inhibitory activity toward other kinases. Biological Example 2 Blood Kinetics in Dogs The kinetic profiles of compound A and the salt thereof (the compound prepared in Example 9) in blood were evaluated in male beagle dogs under fasting conditions. Intravenous administration, as well as both oral liquid and oral suspension administrations were carried out for Compound A prepared in Example 8, and oral administration by capsule was carried out for the compound prepared in Example 9. For the intravenous and oral solution administrations, a solubilized solution of Compound A dissolved in WellSolve (Celeste Inc.) heated to 60° C. was used. Using the solubilized solutions, doses of 1 mg/1 mL/kg were rapidly administered intravenously with a syringe via a forelimb cephalic vein, and doses of 1 mg/5 mL/kg were administered by gavage using a catheter. Approximately 300 μL blood samples were drawn from the jugular vein as follows: for intravenous administration-before administration, 2, 5, 15, and 30 minutes after administration, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after administration; for oral administration-before administration, 5, 15, and 30 minutes after administration, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hours after administration. The blood samples were cooled on ice, separated by centrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 3 min, and the plasma was collected. The concentration of Compound A in the plasma was measured by LC/MS/MS (UPLC/Xevo, Waters). The area under the curve (AUC, ng·h/mL), maximum concentration (Cmax, μg/mL) and clearance (CL, mL/hr/kg) were calculated from the plasma concentration. The bioavailability (BA) of Compound A was calculated from the AUC of the oral dose and the AUC of the intravenous dose. It was found that the BA of Compound A using the solubilized solution was 114.6%. Moreover, for the oral suspension administration a liquid was prepared by finely pulverizing Compound A and suspending the particles in an aqueous solution of 0.5% methylcellulose, and then administering doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg in the same manner as the forced oral administration by gavage described above. The compound from Example 9 was mixed at a 1:1 ratio with D-mannitol to make a dose of 3 mg/kg and placed in a No. 4 capsule (Qualicaps Co., Ltd.). The capsule was administered orally by placing 3 mg/capsule doses deep in the throat to avoid chewing, holding the mouth closed, and inserting 50 mL of water for injection between the teeth to force swallowing. The timing of plasma sampling and measurement of the plasma concentration of Compound A for each administration method were performed in the same manner as in the oral administration of Compound A using the solubilized solution that was described above. The BA values for each administration method and at each concentration were calculated as relative BA by assigning the BA of Compound A in the solubilized solution a value of 100%. The results are shown in Table 5 below. TABLE 5 Dose Relative (mg/kg) BA (%) Solubilized solution of Compound A 1 100 Suspension of pulverized Compound A 3 42 Suspension of pulverized Compound A 10 27 Capsule of compound prepared in Example 9 3 86 The results show that the relative BA of the liquid suspension of pulverized Compound A decreased as the dose increased. Conversely, the relative BA of the compound prepared in Example 9 was higher than the liquid suspension of pulverized Compound A at the same dose. Therefore, it was found that the absorption of the compound of the present invention surpasses that of Compound A. Biological Example 3 Measurement of Solubility First 0.5 mg to 2.5 mg of Compound A (pulverized by a Jet Mill) and the compound prepared in Example 9 were placed in 2.5 mL of various solvents (Japanese Pharmacopoeia dissolution test I liquid, Japanese Pharmacopoeia dissolution test II liquid, diluted McIlvaine buffer (pH 4.0, pH 7.4), purified water, and artificial intestinal fluids (FaSSIF, FeSSIF). With stirring at 700 rpm with a magnetic stirrer, approximately 1 mL samples were taken from the test suspension at 30 min and 24 h after the start of the test, and after filtering with a 0.2 μm filter, the solubility of Compound A was measured by HPLC under the conditions shown below. Table 6 below compares the solubility of Compound A and the compound prepared in Example 9. <HPLC Measurement Conditions> Device: HPLC 1100series, Agilent Column: YMC-Pack ODS-AM AM-302 (4.6 mm ID×150 mm long) Column temperature: 25° C.

Biological Example 4 Evaluation of Stability in Rat and Human Liver Microsomes (1) Preparation of Test Compound Solution A 0.25 mmol/L solution was prepared by diluting the test compound (5 μL of 10 mmol/L DMSO solution) in 50% acetonitrile/water solution (195 μL). (2) Preparation of 0 Min-Reaction Sample First 245 μL of 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mg/mL of rat and human liver microsomes (Xenotech) and NADPH-Co-factor (BD Biosciences) was placed in a reaction vessel that had been pre-heated to 37° C. and pre-incubated for 5 min. Then the test compound solution (5 μL) was added to start the reaction. Immediately after the reaction was started, a 20 μL sample was taken, 180 μL of acetonitrile containing the internal reference substance (warfarin) was added, and the reaction was stopped. After the 20 μL of solution was stirred together with 180 μL of 50% acetonitrile/water solution on a plate equipped with a protein extraction filter, the liquid was suction-filtered and used as the standard sample. (3) Preparation of 15 Min-Reaction Sample After it was incubated for 15 min at 37° C., 20 μL of the above reaction solution was added to 180 μL of cold acetonitrile (containing internal reference substance warfarin), and the reaction was stopped. After the 20 μL of solution was stirred together with 180 μL of 50% acetonitrile/water solution on a plate equipped with a protein extraction filter, the liquid was vacuum-filtered and used as the standard sample. (4) Evaluation Method and Results First 1 μL of sample solution was injected into the LC-MS/MS, and the residual amount (%) was calculated by dividing the ratio of the peak area of the reaction sample (peak area of test compound/peak area of internal reference substance) by the peak area ratio of the standard sample and multiplying by 100.
