BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Oral care implements, especially toothbrushes, are used by many people on a daily basis. Typical oral care implements comprise an elongate handle and a head connected to one end of the handle. The handle provides a structure by which a user grips and manipulates the oral care implement during use. The head typically comprises one or more elements designed to perform their intended function, such as teeth cleaning elements, soft tissue cleaning elements, and/or oral care agents. The effectiveness of an oral care implement at cleaning teeth, soft tissue surfaces, or performing its other intended function(s) typically depends upon the duration for which it is used during an oral care session. A user of an oral care implements may not register for how long they have been using the oral care implement during an oral care session, or they may not know an advisable, recommended or suitable duration for which the oral care implement should be used during any one oral care session in order to achieve a desired result or effect. Over the years, efforts have been made to provide oral care implements with systems for indicating to a user for how long they have been using the implement during an oral care session or for how long they should continue to use the implement during an oral care session. Such efforts have included the development of a toothbrush having a clear handle with an internal chamber that houses an illumination member, illumination of which is controlled by a timing circuit. A flexible grip housing the timing circuit, a switch for activating the timing circuit, and a power source for the timing circuit and the illumination member is connected to an end of the handle. Despite these efforts, a need still exists for an oral care implement having a system for indicating elapse of time to a user, which system allows for a portion of handle of the implement that is intended to be gripped to be more compact and/or better ergonomically designed to be gripped. A need also still exists for an oral care implement having a more robust system for indicating elapse of time to a user. A need further exists for an oral care implement having a system for indicating elapse of time to a user, which implement is more easily manufactured or assembled.

Moreover, the features and benefits of the invention are illustrated by reference to the preferred embodiments. Accordingly, the invention expressly should not be limited to such preferred embodiments illustrating some possible non-limiting combination of features that may exist alone or in other combinations of features. In the following description, the invention is embodied in a vibratable oral care implement, more specifically a vibratable toothbrush. However, in another embodiment, the invention is embodied in a manually-operated, non-vibratable toothbrush, and in another embodiment the invention is embodied in a powered toothbrush wherein one or more cleaning elements provided to the head of the implement are drivable so as to be moved relative to the handle of the implement. In still further embodiments, the invention may be embodied in other forms of oral care implements, such as a soft-tissue cleansing implement, an inter-proximal pick, a flossing tool, a plaque scraper, or another ansate implement designed for oral care. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilised, and that structural and functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. FIG. 1 illustrates an oral care implement, in this case a toothbrush, according to a first embodiment of the present invention, generally designated with the reference numeral 100. The toothbrush 100 has a support 110 including a handle 120 and a head 140. A neck 130 of the handle 120 connects the handle 120 to the head 140, and at least one cleaning element 200 is carried by the head 140. The head 140 is an end portion of the support 110 provided with the at least one cleaning element 200. In this embodiment, the head 140 carries a plurality of cleaning elements 200. In this embodiment, the cleaning elements 200 comprise a plurality of tooth cleaning elements, more specifically a plurality of flexible, nylon bristles arranged in tufts. However, in variations to this embodiment, the cleaning elements 200 may additionally or alternatively comprise at least one of any one or more of the following, without limitation: bristles, rigid bristles, flexible bristles, filament bristles, fibre bristles, nylon bristles, spiral bristles, rubber bristles, elastomeric protrusions, elastomeric elements, flexible polymer protrusions, co-extruded filaments, flag bristles, crimped bristles, anti-bacterial bristles and combinations thereof and/or structures containing such materials or combinations. The head 140 has a first, proximal end 141 and a second, distal end 142. The handle 120 has a first, proximal end 121 and a second, distal end 122. The neck 130 is located at the distal end 122 of the handle 120. The distal end 122 of the handle 120 is connected to the proximal end 141 of the head 140. The neck 130 is generally of a narrower cross sectional area than the head 140 and the rest of the handle 120. The handle 120 provides the user with a mechanism by which he/she can readily grip and manipulate the toothbrush 100, includes ergonomic features which provide a high degree of control for the user while maintaining comfort, and may be formed of many different shapes and with a variety of constructions. Generally, the toothbrush 100 extends from a proximal end 101 (which is also the proximal end 121 of the handle 120) to a distal end 102 (which is also the distal end 142 of the head 140) along a longitudinal axis A-A. Although the handle 120 is a non-linear structure in the illustrated embodiment, the longitudinal axis A-A of the implement 100 is linear in the illustrated embodiment. However, the invention is not so limited, and in certain embodiments, the implement 100 may have a simple linear handle 120 that is longitudinally aligned along the linear longitudinal axis A-A of the implement 100. The head 140 is connected to the handle 120 via the neck 130 of the handle 120. In this embodiment, the head 140 and a first part 123 of the handle 120 (including the neck 130) are formed as an integral structure using an injection molding process. The head 140 and the first part 123 of the handle 120 together comprise a unitary structure. However, in other embodiments, the head 140 and the first part 123 of the handle 120 may be formed as separate components which are operably connected at a later stage of the manufacturing process by any suitable technique known in the art, including without limitation thermal welding, sonic welding, a tight-fit assembly, a coupling sleeve, adhesion, fasteners, and a snap-fit connection. Whether the head 140 and the first part 123 of the handle 120 are constructed as a single piece or a multi-piece assembly (including connection techniques) is not limiting of the present invention in all embodiments. Furthermore, other manufacturing techniques may be used in place of and/or in addition to injection molding to create the first part 123 of the handle 120 and/or the head 140 (or components thereof), such as milling and/or machining. In this embodiment, the head 140 and the first part 123 of the handle 120 are together constructed of a first component 10 of polypropylene (PP) and a second component 20 of an elastomer, such as a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), which has been overmolded onto the first component 10, as discussed in more detail below. However, in variations to this embodiment, the first component 10 may instead or additionally comprise one or more of the following materials: polyethylene, polyamide, polyester, cellulosics, styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN), acrylic, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and a thermoplastic. In variations to this embodiment, the second component 20 may instead or additionally comprise styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS) or one or more of the materials listed in the preceding sentence. The head 140 generally comprises a front surface, on a front side 143 of the head 140, and a rear surface, on a rear side 144 of the head 140 opposite to the front side 143. The front surface and the rear surface of the head 140 can take on a wide variety of shapes and contours, none of which are limiting of the present invention. For example, the front and rear surfaces can be planar, contoured or combinations thereof. The front surface and rear surface are joined by a peripheral or lateral surface 145 of the head 140. The cleaning elements are provided on, and extend outward from, the front side 143 of the head 140 for cleaning contact with an oral surface, preferably teeth. While the plural cleaning elements 200 are particularly suited for cleaning teeth, the cleaning elements 200 can be used to clean oral soft tissue, such as a tongue, gums, or cheeks instead of or in addition to teeth. As used herein, the term “cleaning element” is used in a generic sense to refer to any structure that can be used to clean, massage or polish an oral surface, such as teeth or soft tissue, through relative surface contact. Indeed, in a variation to the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, instead of a plurality of tooth cleaning elements 200, there is instead provided at least one soft tissue cleaning element, such as a tongue scraper comprising at least one blade. Preferably, the, or each, blade has its longitudinal length disposed so as to extend across the front side 143 of the head 140 in a direction non-parallel or perpendicular to the longitudinal axis A-A. On the rear side 144 of the head 140, the head 140 comprises a soft tissue cleaning element 170. The soft tissue cleaning element 170 comprises a plurality of flexible protrusions 172. The protrusions 172 and the rest of the soft tissue cleaning element 170 are a unitary component. The soft tissue cleaning element 170 and the protrusions 172 are formed by the second component 20. The handle 120 is formed of the first part 123 and a second part 124, which is a separate component in the form of a cap that has been attached to the first part 123. While the first part 123 is connected to the head 140 at the distal end 122 of the handle 120, the second part 124 defines the proximal end 121 of the handle 120, indeed the proximal end 101 of the implement 100. A first surface 123a of the first part 123 and a second surface 124a of the second part 124 together define an exterior surface 125 of the handle 120. At least the first surface 123a is to be gripped by a user's hand during an oral care session, so that the user can manipulate the toothbrush 100. As will be appreciated on consideration of FIG. 1, a majority of the exterior surface 125 of the handle 120 is defined by the first surface 123a of the first part 123. In particular, the second surface 124a of the second part 124 defines less than 20%, perhaps less than 10%, of the exterior surface 125 of the handle 120. The first and second components 10, 20 are shaped to provide the handle 120 with ergonomic features which provide a high degree of control for the user while maintaining comfort. Moreover, the second component 20 forms grip regions of the exterior surface 125 of the handle 120 that have a greater coefficient of friction than regions of the exterior surface 125 formed by the first component 10. The first part 123 is opaque. However, the second part 124 is transparent, i.e. is formed of a transparent material. In this embodiment, the second part 124 is made from styrene acrylonitrile resin (SAN) and is attached to the first part 123 of the handle 120 by an adhesive. In other embodiments, the first and second parts 123, 124 of the handle 120 may be attached to each other by other mechanisms, such as a welded joint or respective engaged mechanical elements of the first and second parts 123, 124. In variations to these embodiments, the second part 124 is translucent, i.e. is formed of a translucent material. In variations to the illustrated embodiment, the second part 124 is detachably coupled to the first part 123, as described in more detail below. The second part 124 houses an assembly 300 comprising a printed circuit board 302 upon which are mounted a controller 304, such as a microcontroller, and a light emitting diode (LED) 306. The LED 306 is part of a user-notification device that is configured to output a notification in dependence on a state of a timer comprised in the controller 304. In this embodiment, the user-notification device comprises the LED 306, which is able to emit light that is visible to a user through the transparent second part 124 of the handle 120. However, in variations to this embodiment, the user-notification device may comprise an element, other than an LED, that is configured to output notifications by emitting visible light. In still further variations, the user-notification device may comprise an element that is configured to output a notification by means other than emitting visible light, such as a buzzer or speaker configured to output notifications by emitting sound, or a vibrator configured to output notifications by vibrating. The printed circuit board 302 is located in an internal cavity 124b of the second part 124 and lies in a plane that is parallel to the longitudinal axis A-A of the implement 100. The assembly 300 and the cavity 124b of the second part 124 are each shaped to prevent rotation of the assembly 300 relative to the second part 124 about the longitudinal axis A-A of the implement 100. That is, in this embodiment, the cavity 124b comprises a slot, and the printed circuit board 302 has a rectangular cross-sectional area in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis A-A that is coincident with a rectangular cross-sectional area of the slot in the same plane. Moreover, the assembly comprises first and second electrically-conductive contacts 310, 320 having respective proximal terminals 314, 324 soldered to respective electrically-conductive elements 308a, 308b mounted on the printed circuit board 302. The electrically-conductive elements 308a, 308b are electrically connected to the microprocessor 304. The contacts 310, 320 are disposed relative to the cavity 124b to prevent movement of the assembly 300 relative to the second part 124 in a direction with a component parallel to the longitudinal axis A-A of the implement 100. More particularly, as shown in FIG. 6, respective main bodies 312, 322 of the first and second contacts 310, 320 extend in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis A-A and through respective holes 124c in a wall 124d of the second part 124. Portions of the wall 124d are disposed either side of the holes 124c in the longitudinal direction of the implement 100, so as to prevent movement of the assembly 300 relative to the second part 124 in the longitudinal direction. In the assembled implement 100, respective distal terminals 316, 326 of the contacts 310, 320 are in surface contact with respective electrically-conductive contacts (of which only one is shown in FIG. 7 and indicated with reference numeral 408) comprised in the first part 123. Moreover, in the assembled implement 100, a further resilient terminal 318 of the first contact 310 of the assembly 300 is in surface contact with a battery or other power source disposed in a chamber 123b of the first part 123, as described in more detail below. FIG. 6 illustrates the second part 124 housing the assembly 300, albeit when the second part 124 is not attached to the first part 123 of the handle 120. As shown in FIG. 6, the assembly 300 comprises the controller 304. The controller 304 has an apparatus comprising at least one processor (not expressly shown) and at least one memory (not expressly shown) including computer program code, and the at least one memory and the computer program code are configured to, with the at least one processor, cause the apparatus to track time. In other words, the controller 304 comprises a timer, since the software resident on the controller 304 tracks time. Moreover, the controller 304 comprises part of the user-notification device, in order that the user-notification device is configured to output one or more notifications in dependence on the state of the timer. The user-notification device also comprises the LED 306. The timer is activated by a user closing a switch comprised in the first part 123 of the handle 120. More specifically, the user presses on a first defined region 126 of the first surface 123a of the first part 123 that is formed of the second component 20. The defined region 126 is resilient, so the user's application of a force on the defined region 126 causes the defined region 126 to deform. In turn, this deformation causes the switch at a side of the defined region 126 interior to the first part 123 of the handle 120 to be closed, which completes an electric circuit including a motor 500 (discussed below), the controller 304, the battery or other power source disposed in the internal chamber 123b of the first part 123, and wires 501-504, as described in more detail below. Thus, as a result of the switch being closed, the motor and controller 304 receive electric power, which causes the motor 500 to rotate and the timer embodied in the controller 304 to be activated to track time. Although not expressly shown in the Figures, a mechanical vibratory device, such as an eccentric, is mounted on an output shaft of the motor 500 whereby, when the motor 500 rotates, the mechanical vibratory device rotates about the axis of the output shaft of the motor 500, causing the head 140 of the implement 100 to vibrate, which increases the efficiency with which the cleaning elements 200 clean an oral surface during use of the implement 100. Since the timer tracks time, a state of the timer changes over time. In various different embodiments, the user-notification device is configured to output one or more notifications (such as by causing the LED 306 to emit light) in dependence on the state of the timer. For example, in the present embodiment, the controller 304 tracks time and, in accordance with commands included in the computer program code, causes the LED 306 to adopt a different lighting pattern in dependence on the length of time that has elapsed since the timer was activated. In this embodiment, for a first period of 30 seconds starting when the timer was activated, the controller 304 causes the LED 306 to emit single flashes of light with pauses of equal duration between the single flashes. For a second period of 30 seconds following the first period, the controller 304 causes the LED 306 to emit successive pairs of single flashes of light with first pauses of equal duration between the pairs and second pauses of equal duration between the single flashes of each pair, wherein each of the first pauses is longer, preferably at least two or three times as long, than each of the second pauses. In other embodiments, the first period may be of the same or a different duration to the second period. The first and/or the second period may be, for example, of any of the following durations: 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, and 60 seconds. In other embodiments, still further lighting patterns may be employed. In any event, preferably the user-notification device is configured to output a first predetermined notification when the timer is in a first state and to output a second predetermined notification when the timer is in a second state, which second predetermined notification is of a different form to the first predetermined notification. The second predetermined notification may have a different duration, pattern and/or frequency than the first predetermined notification. Accordingly, during use of the oral care implement 100, the user is notified of an elapse of time, specifically an elapse of time since the first switch was closed. When the user has completed their oral care session, they open the switch comprised in the first part 123 of the handle 120. More specifically, the user presses on a second defined region 127 of the first surface 123a of the first part 123 that is formed of the second component 20. The second defined region 127 also is resilient, so the user's application of a force on the second defined region 127 causes the second defined region 127 to deform. In turn, this deformation causes the switch to be opened, which breaks the electric circuit. In this embodiment, the controller 304 has no ability to record conditions of use of the implement 100 during the completed oral case session, so the software resident in the controller 304 resets to a default initial state once the electric circuit has been broken. Accordingly, when the switch is subsequently closed again, the controller 304 will carry out the same process as described above. The motor 500 and power source (not shown) discussed above are comprised in the first part 123 of the handle 120, as shown in FIG. 7. More particularly, the motor 500 is located in the neck 130 of the handle 120 of the implement 100. In the assembled implement 100, the power source is disposed between the motor 500 and the assembly 300. As discussed above, the motor 500 is connectable to the power source by way of a user closing the switch. It is to be noted that, in this embodiment, the motor 500 and the assembly 300 are electrically connected in parallel to the power source. In particular, the motor 500 is connected to the power source by a first pair of wires 501, 502, and the assembly 300 is connected to the power source by a parallel second pair of wires 503, 504. In this embodiment, the motor 500 and the assembly 300 (including the timer and the user-notification device, and thus including the controller 304 and the LED 306) are connected, in parallel, to the same shared power supply, so that the motor 500 and the assembly 300 are able to be electrically powered by the power supply. The power supply may consist of one, two or a plurality of batteries or cells, disposed in the chamber 123b of the first part 123. In another embodiment, the motor 500 and the assembly 300 (including the timer and the user-notification device, and thus including the controller 304 and the LED 306) are connected, in series, to the same shared power supply, so that the motor 500 and the assembly 300 are able to be electrically powered by the power supply. In the above-mentioned variations to the illustrated embodiment, in which the second part 124 is detachably coupled to the first part 123, the second part 124 may be detachably coupled to the first part 123 by any of a tight-fit, twist-and-lock, snap-fit and threaded connection. It can be considered that an interface is provided between the first and second parts 123, 124 where the first and second parts 123, 124 are connected to each other. In some embodiments, a compressible or resilient gasket or seal is provided at the interface. The gasket or seal may be formed of TPE and/or may be part of the second component 20. Preferably the gasket or seal surrounds the interface. Preferably, the gasket or seal becomes compressed during coupling of the second part 124 to the first part 123 whereby, in the assembled implement 100, the gasket or seal is in a compressed state and prevents or minimises fluid flow from an exterior of the first and second parts 123, 124 into the chamber 123b and/or into the cavity 124b. Accordingly, the gasket or seal seals the assembly 300, motor 500 and power supply from water during use of the assembled implement 100, yet the ability to detach the second part 124 from the first part 123 permits replacement of the power supply and/or maintenance of the assembly 300, if required. In this embodiment, the user-notification device is configured to output a predetermined notification in dependence on a state of the power source. In this embodiment, the controller 304 monitors the state of the power source, such as the remaining charge in the power source and, when the remaining charge drops below a predetermined threshold value of charge, the user-notification device causes the LED 306 to emit light in a predetermined lighting pattern. The predetermined lighting pattern may comprise the LED 306 being caused to emit light for a relatively long duration, such as 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds, or 60 seconds, or may comprise the LED 306 being caused to emit a rapid burst of flashes of light, such as 5 or 10 distinct flashes per second. Other predetermined lighting pattern will be apparent to the skilled person. Manufacture of the toothbrush 100 shown in FIG. 1 will now be described with additional reference to FIGS. 2 to 10. In a first process of the method of manufacturing the oral care implement 100, the second part 124 of the handle 120, including the wall 124d, internal cavity 124b and the holes 124c in the wall 124d, is formed, in this embodiment from transparent material by molding the transparent material. The second part 124 so formed is shown in FIG. 3. In a second process, which may be performed during, before or after the first process, the assembly 300 is assembled. More specifically, the printed circuit board 302 is provided and the controller 304 (e.g. a microcontroller), LED 306 and electrically-conductive elements 308a, 308b are mounted on the printed circuit board 302, as shown in FIG. 2. After each of the first and second processes has been completed, a third process is performed in which at least part of the assembly 300 is inserted into the cavity 124b of the second part 124 of the handle 120, in such a manner that the printed circuit board 302 lies in a plane that is parallel to the longitudinal axis A-A of the completed implement 100, as shown in FIG. 4. As discussed above, the assembly 300 and the cavity 124b of the second part 124 are shaped to prevent rotation of the assembly 300 relative to the second part 124 about the longitudinal axis A-A of the implement 100. Following the third process, a fourth process is performed in which the first and second contacts 310, 320 (shown in FIG. 5) are provided, and the respective proximal terminals 314, 324 of the first and second contacts 310, 320 are soldered to respective ones of the electrically-conductive elements 308a, 308b mounted on the printed circuit board 302, so that the respective main bodies 312, 322 of the first and second contacts 310, 320 extend in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis A-A and through respective holes 124c in the wall 124d of the second part 124, as shown in FIG. 6. Accordingly, the first and second contacts 310, 320 act as elements that prevent movement of the assembly 300 relative to the second part 124 in a direction with a component parallel to the longitudinal axis A-A of the completed implement 100. A fifth process, which may be performed during, before or after any or all of the first to fourth processes, comprises providing the head 140 and the first part 123 of the handle 120 that is connected to the head 140. This fifth process involves first forming the first material to form the first component 10 (as shown in FIG. 7). This may be performed in accordance with any method known in the art, such as by injection molding the first material into a suitable mould in a molten state and then allowing the first material to cool and harden. Next, the motor 500 is disposed in the neck 130 of the first part 123 of the handle 120, and the first pair of wires 501, 502 having respective first ends connected to respective terminals of the motor 500 are routed so that their respective second ends, opposite to the first ends, are located within the chamber 123b of the first part 123, via a hole 129 in the first component 10, for future connection to a power source that will be located in the chamber 123b. Also, the second pair of wires 503, 504 having respective first ends connected to respective electrically-conductive contacts 408 within the chamber 123b are routed so that their respective second ends, opposite to the first ends, are located within the chamber 123b of the first part 123, via the hole 129 in the first component 10, for future connection to the power source. Finally, the second material forming the second component 20 is overmolded onto the first component 10 to encase the motor 500 and the majority of the two pairs of wires 501, 502, 503, 504. The resultant device is shown in FIG. 8. It is to be noted that, in this embodiment, each of the first and second components 10, 20 is opaque. Optionally at this stage, the power source may be disposed in the chamber 123b between the motor 500 and an end of the chamber 123b to which the second part 124 of the handle 120 is later attached. A sixth process, which may be performed during, before or after the first to fifth processes, involves providing a cleaning element sub-assembly 600, as shown in FIG. 9. The sub-assembly 600 comprises a base plate 601 and the at least one cleaning element 200 extending from the base plate 601. The one or more cleaning elements 200 may be connected to the base plate 601 by any mechanism known in the art, such as AFT, IMT, or stapling. A seventh process, which may be performed after the sixth process, involves attaching the cleaning element sub-assembly 600 to the head 140, in order to provide the head 140 with the at least one cleaning element 200, as shown in FIG. 10. This attaching may involve, for example, adhering the sub-assembly 600 to the head 140 or sonic welding a portion of the sub-assembly 600 to the head 140. An eighth process, which may be performed before, during or after the seventh process, comprises disposing the power source in the chamber 123b (if not already done), and then attaching the second part 124 of the handle 120 to the first part 123 of the handle 120, so that the first part 123 is connected to the head 140 at the distal end 122 of the handle 120, the second part 124 defines the proximal end 121 of the handle 120, and the first and second surfaces 123a, 124a of the first and second parts 123, 124 together define the exterior surface 125 of the handle 120. The attaching may comprise attaching the second part 124 to the first part 123 by one or more of: adhering, welding, and engaging respective mechanical elements of the first and second parts 123, 124. Alternatively, the attaching may comprise detachably coupling the second part 124 to the first part 123, and may optionally also comprise providing or compressing a seal or gasket between the first and second parts 123, 124 during the coupling of the second part 124 to the first part 123, whereby, in the assembled implement 100, the gasket or seal is in a compressed state and prevents or minimises fluid flow from an exterior of the first and second parts 123, 124 into the chamber 123b and/or into the cavity 124b. During the eighth process, the power source becomes disposed between the motor 500 and the assembly 300. Moreover, the distal terminals 316, 326 of the contacts 310, 320 are brought into surface contact with the respective electrically-conductive contacts (of which one is shown in FIG. 7 and indicated with reference numeral 408) comprised in the first part 123, and the further resilient terminal 318 of the first contact 310 of the assembly 300 is brought into surface contact with the power source disposed in the chamber 123b of the first part 123, whereby the motor 500 and the assembly 300 become electrically connected in parallel to the power source. In the present invention, since the assembly 300 is housed in the second part 124 of the handle 120, the first part 123 of the handle 120, which first part 123 is intended to be gripped by a user during use of the implement 100, is able to be made compact and/or better ergonomically designed for gripping by the user. The first part 123 also can be made of a wide variety of materials, including opaque materials. Moreover, since the assembly 300 including the user-notification device is housed in the second part 124 of the handle, protrusion of parts of the assembly 300 from the second part 124 into the first part 123 of the handle 120 can be minimised or avoided, which provides a system for indicating elapse of time to a user that is more robust, since parts of the assembly 300 are not likely to be knocked or damaged during manufacture of the implement 100. Moreover, the implement 100 is more easily manufactured than known prior art devices including systems for indicating elapse of time to a user, since the majority of the implement 100 is manufacturable independently of the system for indicating elapse of time to a user and the provision of the system for indicating elapse of time to a user requires significant modifications only to the second part 124 of the handle 120. Assembly of the implement 100 also is relatively straightforward: the first part 123 of the handle 120 can be assembled separately to the second part 124 of the handle 120, and the first and second parts 123, 124 need only be attached to each other towards or at the end of the assembly process. The present invention may be embodied as a kit of parts for an oral care implement 100, the kit of parts comprising: the head 140 carrying the at least one cleaning element 200; the first part 123 of the handle 120, which first part 123 is connected to the head 140 and has the first surface 123a; and the second part 124 of the handle 120, which second part 124 has the second surface 124a and houses the assembly 300 comprising the timer and the user-notification device that is configured to output a notification in dependence on a state of the timer; wherein the second part 124 is attachable to the first part 123 so that the first part 123 is connected to the head 14D at the distal end 122 of the handle 120, the second part 124 defines the proximal end 121 of the handle 120, and the first and second surfaces 123a, 124a together define the exterior surface 125 of the handle 120. While the invention has been described with respect to specific examples including presently preferred modes of carrying out the invention, those skilled in the art will appreciate that there are numerous variations and permutations of the above described implements and techniques. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.
