BACKGROUND Signaling through the B-cell receptor (BCR) can lead to a range of biological outputs depending upon, in part, the developmental stage of the B-cell. Faulty signaling through the BCR can cause disregulation of the B-cell function and/or the formation of auto-antibodies which may lead to the auto-immune and/or inflammatory diseases. Therapeutics, such as Rituxan, which deplete B-cells are effective in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatiod arthritis. Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) is a member of the TEC family of kinases and is a regulator of B-cell development, activation, signaling and survival. BTK is downstream of the BCR. In humans, mutation of BTK causes X-linked agammaglobuliaemia results in a compromised immune system, impaired maturation of B-cells, decreased peripheral B-cell levels and reduced calcium mobilization following stimulation through the BCR. Further evidence for the role of BTK in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases has been established utilizing both BTK knock-out mouse models and pharmacological inhibitors. In addition to B-cells, BTK is expressed on several other cell types that may contribute to disease, for example: mast cells, basophils, neutrophils, monocytes and osteoclasts. From this prespective it is clear that BTK inhibitors should provided substantial therapeutic benefit for patients afflicted with, for example: multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, myasthenia gravis, allergic rhinitis, Sjögren's syndrome, B-cell lymphoma and leukemia. SUMMARY Described herein are inhibitors of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Also described herein are methods for synthesizing such inhibitors, methods for using such inhibitors in the treatment of diseases, including diseases wherein inhibition of BTK provides therapeutic benefit to a patient having the disease. Further described are pharmaceutical formulations that include an inhibitor of BTK.

All documents, or portions of documents, cited in the application including, but not limited to, patents, patent applications, articles, books, manuals, and treatises are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety for any purpose. Various aspects of the invention are set forth below in sections; however, aspects of the invention described in one particular section are not to be limited to any particular section. Further, when a variable is not accompanied by a definition, the previous definition of the variable controls. DEFINITIONS It is to be understood that the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of any subject matter claimed. In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise. It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. In this application, the use of “or” means “and/or” unless stated otherwise. Furthermore, use of the term “including” as well as other forms, such as “include”, “includes,” and “included,” is not limiting. It is to be understood that the methods and compositions described herein are not limited to the particular methodology, protocols, cell lines, constructs, and reagents described herein and as such may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the methods and compositions described herein, which will be limited only by the appended claims. The term “Bruton's tyrosine kinase,” as used herein, refers to Bruton's tyrosine kinase from Homo sapiens, as disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,469 (GenBank Accession No. NP. sub.-000052). The term “Bruton's tyrosine kinase homolog,” as used herein, refers to orthologs of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, e.g., the orthologs from mouse (GenBank Accession No. AAB47246), dog (GenBank Accession No. XP. sub.-549139.), rat (GenBank Accession No. NP. sub.-001007799), chicken (GenBank Accession No. NP. sub.-989564), or zebra fish (GenBank Accession No. XP. sub.-698117), and fusion proteins of any of the foregoing that exhibit kinase activity towards one or more substrates of Bruton's tyrosine kinase. The term “homologous cysteine,” as used herein refers to a cysteine residue found with in a sequence position that is homologous to that of cysteine 481 of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, as defined herein. For example, cysteine 482 is the homologous cysteine of the rat ortholog of Bruton's tyrosine kinase; cysteine 479 is the homologous cysteine of the chicken ortholog; and cysteine 481 is the homologous cysteine in the zebra fish ortholog. In another example, the homologous cysteine of TXK, a Tec kinase family member related to Bruton's tyrosine, is Cys 350. Other examples of kinases having homologous cysteines are shown in FIG. 1 of U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012/252822, which is hereby incorporated by reference. See also the sequence alignments of tyrosine kinases (TK) published on the world wide web at kinase.com/human/kinome/phylogeny.html. The term “BTK inhibitor,” as used herein, refers to an inhibitor of BTK that can form a covalent bond with an amino acid residue of BTK. In one embodiment, the inhibitor of BTK can form a covalent bond with a Cys residue of BTK. The term “modulate,” as used herein, means to interact with a target either directly or indirectly so as to alter the activity of the target, including, by way of example only, to enhance the activity of the target, to inhibit the activity of the target, to limit the activity of the target, or to extend the activity of the target. As used herein, the term “modulator” refers to a compound that alters an activity of a molecule. For example, a modulator can cause an increase or decrease in the magnitude of a certain activity of a molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity in the absence of the modulator. In certain embodiments, a modulator is an inhibitor, which decreases the magnitude of one or more activities of a molecule. In certain embodiments, an inhibitor completely prevents one or more activities of a molecule. In certain embodiments, a modulator is an activator, which increases the magnitude of at least one activity of a molecule. In certain embodiments the presence of a modulator results in an activity that does not occur in the absence of the modulator. The term “heteroatom” refers to an atom other than carbon or hydrogen. Heteroatoms are typically independently selected from among oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, silicon and phosphorus, but are not limited to these atoms. In embodiments in which two or more heteroatoms are present, the two or more heteroatoms can all be the same as one another, or some or all of the two or more heteroatoms can each be different from the others. The term “alkyl” refers to a linear or branched-chain saturated hydrocarbyl substituent (i.e., a substituent obtained from a hydrocarbon by removal of a hydrogen) containing from one to twelve carbon atoms. Examples of such substituents include methyl, ethyl, propyl (including n-propyl and isopropyl), butyl (including n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl and tert-butyl), pentyl, isoamyl, hexyl and the like. The terms “haloalkyl” and “haloalkoxy” include alkyl, and alkoxy structures, respectively, in which at least one hydrogen is replaced with a halogen atom. In certain embodiments in which two or more hydrogen atoms are replaced with halogen atoms, the halogen atoms are all the same as one another. In other embodiments in which two or more hydrogen atoms are replaced with halogen atoms, the halogen atoms are not all the same as one another. The term “fluoroalkyl,” as used herein, refers to alkyl group in which at least one hydrogen is replaced with a fluorine atom. Examples of fluoroalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, —CF3, —CH2CF3, —CF2CF3, —CH2CH2CF3 and the like. The term “cycloalkyl” refers to a carbocyclic substituent obtained by removing a hydrogen from a saturated carbocyclic molecule and having three to ten carbon atoms. In one embodiment, a cycloalkyl substituent has three to ten carbon atoms. Cycloalkyl may be a single ring, which typically contains from 3 to 6 ring atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. Alternatively, cycloalkyl may be 2 or 3 rings fused together, such as bicyclo[4.2.0]octane and decalinyl and may also be referred to as “bicycloalkyl”. The term “aryl” refers to an aromatic substituent containing one ring or two or three fused rings. The aryl substituent may have six to eighteen carbon atoms. As an example, the aryl substituent may have six to fourteen carbon atoms. The term “aryl” may refer to substituents such as phenyl, naphthyl and anthracenyl. The term “aryl” also includes substituents such as phenyl, naphthyl and anthracenyl that are fused to a C4-10 carbocyclic ring, such as a C5 or a C6 carbocyclic ring, or to a 4- to 10-membered heterocyclic ring, wherein a group having such a fused aryl group as a substituent is bound to an aromatic carbon of the aryl group. When such a fused aryl group is substituted with one more substituents, the one or more substitutents, unless otherwise specified, are each bound to an aromatic carbon of the fused aryl group. The fused C4-10 carbocyclic or 4- to 10-membered heterocyclic ring may be optionally substituted with halogen, C1-6alkyl, C3-10cycloalkyl, or ═O. Examples of aryl groups include accordingly phenyl, naphthalenyl, tetrahydronaphthalenyl (also known as “tetralinyl”), indenyl, isoindenyl, indanyl, anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, benzonaphthenyl (also known as “phenalenyl”), and fluorenyl. The term “arylene” refers to a bivalent radical formed by removing a hydrogen atom from an aryl, as described above. In some instances, the number of atoms in a cyclic substituent containing one or more heteroatoms (i.e., heteroaryl or heterocycloalkyl) is indicated by the prefix “A-B membered”, wherein A is the minimum and B is the maximum number of atoms forming the cyclic moiety of the substituent. Thus, for example, 5-8 membered heterocycloalkyl refers to a heterocycloalkyl containing from 5 to 8 atoms, including one or more heteroatoms, in the cyclic moiety of the heterocycloalkyl. The term “hydroxy” or “hydroxyl” refers to OH. The term “cyano” (also referred to as “nitrile”) means CN. The terms “halogen” and “halo” refer to fluorine (which may be depicted as F), chlorine (which may be depicted as Cl), bromine (which may be depicted as Br), or iodine (which may be depicted as I). In one embodiment, the halogen is chlorine. In another embodiment, the halogen is fluorine. In another embodiment, the halogen is bromine. The terms “heterocycloalkyl” and “heterocyclyl” are used interchangeably and refer to a substituent obtained by removing a hydrogen from a saturated or partially saturated ring structure containing a total of 4 to 14 ring atoms, wherein at least one of the ring atoms is a heteroatom selected from oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur. For example, as used herein, the term “4- to 10-membered heterocycloalkyl” means the substituent is a single ring with 4 to 10 total members. A heterocycloalkyl alternatively may comprise 2 or 3 rings fused together, wherein at least one such ring contains a heteroatom as a ring atom (i.e., nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur). In a group that has a heterocycloalkyl substituent, the ring atom of the heterocycloalkyl substituent that is bound to the group may be one of the heteroatoms, or it may be a ring carbon atom, where the ring carbon atom may be in the same ring as the heteroatom(s) or where the ring carbon atom may be in a different ring from the heteroatom(s). Similarly, if the heterocycloalkyl substituent is in turn substituted with a group or substituent, the group or substituent may be bound to the heteroatom(s), or it may be bound to a ring carbon atom, where the ring carbon atom may be in the same ring as the at least one heteroatom or where the ring carbon atom may be in a different ring from the heteroatom(s). The term “heteroaryl” refers to a substituent obtained by removing a hydrogen from an aromatic ring structure containing from 5 to 14 ring atoms in which at least one of the ring atoms is a heteroatom (i.e., oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur), with the remaining ring atoms being independently selected from the group consisting of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. A heteroaryl may be a single ring or 2 or 3 fused rings. Examples of heteroaryl substituents include but are not limited to: 6-membered ring substituents such as pyridyl, pyrazyl, pyrimidinyl, and pyridazinyl; 5-membered ring substituents such as triazolyl, imidazolyl, furanyl, thiophenyl, pyrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, 1,2,3-, 1,2,4-, 1,2,5-, or 1,3,4-oxadiazolyl and isothiazolyl; 6/5-membered fused ring substituents such as benzothiofuranyl, isobenzothiofuranyl, benzisoxazolyl, benzoxazolyl, purinyl, and anthranilyl; and 6/6-membered fused ring substituents such as quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, cinnolinyl, quinazolinyl, and 1,4-benzoxazinyl. In a group that has a heteroaryl substituent, the ring atom of the heteroaryl substituent that is bound to the group may be the at least one heteroatom, or it may be a ring carbon atom, where the ring carbon atom may be in the same ring as the at least one heteroatom or where the ring carbon atom may be in a different ring from the at least one heteroatom. Similarly, if the heteroaryl substituent is in turn substituted with a group or substituent, the group or substituent may be bound to the heteroatom, or it may be bound to a ring carbon atom, where the ring carbon atom may be in the same ring as the heteroatom(s) or where the ring carbon atom may be in a different ring from the heteroatom(s). The term “heteroaryl” also includes pyridyl N-oxides and groups containing a pyridine N-oxide ring. The term “heteroarylene” refers to a bivalent radical formed by removing a hydrogen atom from a heteroaryl, as described above. This specification uses the terms “substituent,” “radical,” and “group” interchangeably. If a group of substituents are collectively described as being optionally substituted by one or more of a list of substituents, the group may include: (1) unsubstitutable substituents, (2) substitutable substituents that are not substituted by the optional substituents, and/or (3) substitutable substituents that are substituted by one or more of the optional substituents. If a substituent is described such that it “may be substituted” or as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non-hydrogen substituents, that substituent may be either (1) not substituted; or (2) substituted by up to that particular number of non-hydrogen substituents or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the substituent, whichever is less. Thus, for example, if a substituent is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen substituents, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen substituents as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen substituent. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen substituents, then the nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen substituents if the amino nitrogen is a primary nitrogen, whereas the amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen substituent if the amino nitrogen is a secondary nitrogen. A prefix attached to a multi-moiety substituent only applies to the first moiety. To illustrate, the term “alkylcycloalkyl” contains two moieties: alkyl and cycloalkyl. Thus, a (C1-C6) prefix on (C1-C6)alkylcycloalkyl means that the alkyl moiety of the alkylcycloalkyl contains from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; the (C1-C6)-prefix does not describe the cycloalkyl moiety. To illustrate further, the prefix “halo” on haloalkoxyalkyl indicates that only the alkoxy moiety of the alkoxyalkyl substituent is substituted with one or more halogen substituents. If the halogen substitution only occurs on the alkyl moiety, the substituent would be described as “alkoxyhaloalkyl.” If the halogen substitution occurs on both the alkyl moiety and the alkoxy moiety, the substituent would be described as “haloalkoxyhaloalkyl.” As used herein the term “Formula (I) and Formula (II)” may be referred to as a “compound(s) of the invention.” Such terms are also defined to include all forms of the compounds of Formula (I) and Formula (II) including hydrates, solvates, isomers, crystalline and non-crystalline forms, isomorphs, polymorphs, and metabolites thereof. For example, the compounds of Formula (I) and Formula (II), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm. A “metabolite” of a compound disclosed herein is a derivative of that compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized. The term “active metabolite” refers to a biologically active derivative of a compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized. The term “metabolized,” as used herein, refers to the sum of the processes (including, but not limited to, hydrolysis reactions and reactions catalyzed by enzymes, such as, oxidation reactions) by which a particular substance is changed by an organism. Thus, enzymes may produce specific structural alterations to a compound. For example, cytochrome P450 catalyzes a variety of oxidative and reductive reactions while uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferases catalyze the transfer of an activated glucuronic-acid molecule to aromatic alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines and free sulfhydryl groups. Further information on metabolism may be obtained from The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Edition, McGraw-Hill (1996). Metabolites of the compounds disclosed herein can be identified either by administration of compounds to a host and analysis of tissue samples from the host, or by incubation of compounds with hepatic cells in vitro and analysis of the resulting compounds. Both methods are well known in the art. In some embodiments, metabolites of a compound are formed by oxidative processes and correspond to the corresponding hydroxy-containing compound. In some embodiments, a compound is metabolized to pharmacologically active metabolites. In some embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as prodrugs. A “prodrug” refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. To produce a prodrug, a pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated upon in vivo administration. The prodrug can be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, those of skill in this art, once a pharmaceutically active compound is known, can design prodrugs of the compound. (see, for example, Nogrady (1985) Medicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach, Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392; Silverman (1992), The Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, pages 352-401, Saulnier et al., (1994), Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Vol. 4, p. 1985). Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a derivative as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases, some of the herein-described compounds may be a prodrug for another derivative or active compound. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. Prodrugs may be designed as reversible drug derivatives, for use as modifiers to enhance drug transport to site-specific tissues. In some embodiments, the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. See, e.g., Fedorak et al., Am. J. Physiol., 269:G210-218 (1995); McLoed et al., Gastroenterol, 106:405-413 (1994); Hochhaus et al., Biomed. Chrom., 6:283-286 (1992); J. Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Int. J. Pharmaceutics, 37, 87 (1987); J. Larsen et al., Int. J. Pharmaceutics, 47, 103 (1988); Sinkula et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 64:181-210 (1975); T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series; and Edward B. Roche, Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, all incorporated herein in their entirety. The compounds of the invention may have asymmetric carbon atoms. The carbon-carbon bonds of the compounds of the invention may be depicted herein using a solid line, a solid wedge or a dotted wedge. The use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers (e.g. specific enantiomers, racemic mixtures, etc.) at that carbon atom are included. The use of either a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that only the stereoisomer shown is meant to be included. It is possible that compounds of the invention may contain more than one asymmetric carbon atom. In those compounds, the use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers are meant to be included. For example, unless stated otherwise, it is intended that the compounds of the invention can exist as enantiomers and diastereomers or as racemates and mixtures thereof. The use of a solid line to depict bonds to one or more asymmetric carbon atoms in a compounds of the invention and the use of a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to other asymmetric carbon atoms in the same compound is meant to indicate that a mixture of diastereomers is present. Stereoisomers of compounds of the invention include cis and trans isomers, optical isomers such as R and S enantiomers, diastereomers, geometric isomers, rotational isomers, conformational isomers, and tautomers of the compounds of the invention, including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism; and mixtures thereof (such as racemates and diastereomeric pairs). Also included are acid addition or base addition salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, D-lactate or L-lysine, or racemic, for example, DL-tartrate or DL-arginine. When any racemate crystallizes, crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer. The present invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in Formulae (I) and (II) herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that may be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine and chlorine, such as, but not limited to, 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36Cl. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of Formula (I) and Formula (II), for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14O are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically-labeled compounds the invention may generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples and Preparations below, by substituting an isotopically-labeled reagent for a non-isotopically-labeled reagent. The compounds of this invention may be used in the form of salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. Depending on the particular compound, a salt of the compound may be advantageous due to one or more of the salt's physical properties, such as enhanced pharmaceutical stability in differing temperatures and humidities, or a desirable solubility in water or oil. In some instances, a salt of a compound also may be used as an aid in the isolation, purification, and/or resolution of the compound. Where a salt is intended to be administered to a patient (as opposed to, for example, being used in an in vitro context), the salt preferably is pharmaceutically acceptable. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a salt prepared by combining a compounds of Formula (I) and Formula (II) with an acid whose anion, or a base whose cation, is generally considered suitable for human consumption.

Pharmaceutical Compositions and Dosing Considerations Typically, a compound of the invention is administered in an amount effective to treat a condition as described herein. The compounds of the invention are administered by any suitable route in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route, and in a dose effective for the treatment intended. Therapeutically effective doses of the compounds required to treat the progress of the medical condition are readily ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art using preclinical and clinical approaches familiar to the medicinal arts. The term “therapeutically effective amount” as used herein refers to that amount of the compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disorder being treated. The term “treating”, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, means reversing, alleviating, inhibiting the progress of, or preventing the disorder or condition to which such term applies, or one or more symptoms of such disorder or condition. The term “treatment”, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, refers to the act of treating as “treating” is defined immediately above. The term “treating” also includes adjuvant and neo-adjuvant treatment of a subject. As indicated above, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions, which comprise a therapeutically-effective amount of one or more of the compounds described above, formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (additives) and/or diluents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be specially formulated for administration in solid or liquid form, including those adapted for the following: (1) oral administration, for example, drenches (aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions), tablets, e.g., those targeted for buccal, sublingual, and systemic absorption, boluses, powders, granules, pastes for application to the tongue; (2) parenteral administration, for example, by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or epidural injection as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension, or sustained-release formulation; (3) topical application, for example, as a cream, ointment, or a controlled-release patch or spray applied to the skin; (4) intravaginally or intrarectally, for example, as a pessary, cream or foam; (5) sublingually; (6) ocularly; (7) transdermally; or (8) nasally. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Wetting agents, emulsifiers and lubricants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, release agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the compositions. Examples of pharmaceutically-acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Formulations of the present invention include those suitable for oral, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal and/or parenteral administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host being treated, the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the compound which produces a therapeutic effect. Generally, out of one hundred percent, this amount will range from about 0.1 percent to about ninety-nine percent of active ingredient, preferably from about 5 percent to about 70 percent, most preferably from about 10 percent to about 30 percent. In certain embodiments, a formulation of the present invention comprises an excipient selected from the group consisting of cyclodextrins, celluloses, liposomes, micelle forming agents, e.g., bile acids, and polymeric carriers, e.g., polyesters and polyanhydrides; and a compound of the present invention. In certain embodiments, an aforementioned formulation renders orally bioavailable a compound of the present invention. Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with the carrier and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound of the present invention with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges (using a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth), powders, granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles (using an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia) and/or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the present invention as an active ingredient. A compound of the present invention may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste. In solid dosage forms of the invention for oral administration (capsules, tablets, pills, dragees, powders, granules, trouches and the like), the active ingredient is mixed with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, and/or any of the following: (1) fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; (2) binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; (3) humectants, such as glycerol; (4) disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; (5) solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; (6) absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds and surfactants, such as poloxamer and sodium lauryl sulfate; (7) wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate, and non-ionic surfactants; (8) absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; (9) lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, zinc stearate, sodium stearate, stearic acid, and mixtures thereof; (10) coloring agents; and (11) controlled release agents such as crospovidone or ethyl cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-shelled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared using binder (for example, gelatin or hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, disintegrant (for example, sodium starch glycolate or cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), surface-active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets, and other solid dosage forms of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, such as dragees, capsules, pills and granules, may optionally be scored or prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical-formulating art. They may also be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein using, for example, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. They may be formulated for rapid release, e.g., freeze-dried. They may be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved in sterile water, or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use. These compositions may also optionally contain opacifying agents and may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds of the invention include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, coloring, perfuming and preservative agents. Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof. Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by mixing one or more compounds of the invention with one or more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising, for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a suppository wax or a salicylate, and which is solid at room temperature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. Formulations of the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required. The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may contain, in addition to an active compound of this invention, excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes, paraffins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyethylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc oxide, or mixtures thereof. Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to a compound of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc, silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays can additionally contain customary propellants, such as chlorofluorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as butane and propane. Transdermal patches have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound of the present invention to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispersing the compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate of such flux can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye include, for example, eye drops wherein the compound of this invention is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier. A typical formulation suitable for ocular or aural administration may be in the form of drops of a micronised suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (i.e., absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (i.e., silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinyl alcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methylcellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis. For intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the active compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of a solution or suspension from a pump spray container that is squeezed or pumped by the patient or as an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurized container or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant. Formulations suitable for intranasal administration are typically administered in the form of a dry powder (either alone; as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose; or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler or as an aerosol spray from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser (preferably an atomiser using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane. For intranasal use, the powder may comprise a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin. Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise one or more compounds of the invention in combination with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable sterile isotonic aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, or sterile powders which may be reconstituted into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use, which may contain sugars, alcohols, antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient or suspending or thickening agents. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters, such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants. These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms upon the subject compounds may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally-administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly (anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue. When the compounds of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals, they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing, for example, 0.1 to 99% (more preferably, 10 to 30%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The preparations of the present invention may be given orally, parenterally, topically, or rectally. They are of course given in forms suitable for each administration route. For example, they are administered in tablets or capsule form, by injection, inhalation, eye lotion, ointment, suppository, etc. administration by injection, infusion or inhalation; topical by lotion or ointment; and rectal by suppositories. Oral administrations are preferred. The phrases “parenteral administration” and “administered parenterally” as used herein means modes of administration other than enteral and topical administration, usually by injection, and includes, without limitation, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, intradermal, intraperitoneal, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticulare, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal and intrasternal injection and infusion. The phrases “systemic administration,” “administered systemically,” “peripheral administration” and “administered peripherally” as used herein mean the administration of a compound, drug or other material other than directly into the central nervous system, such that it enters the patient's system and, thus, is subject to metabolism and other like processes, for example, subcutaneous administration. These compounds may be administered to humans and other animals for therapy by any suitable route of administration, including orally, nasally, as by, for example, a spray, rectally, intravaginally, parenterally, intracisternally and topically, as by powders, ointments or drops, including buccally and sublingually. Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present invention, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically-acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art. Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the particular compound of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion or metabolism of the particular compound being employed, the rate and extent of absorption, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts. A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. In general, a suitable daily dose of a compound of the invention will be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Preferably, the compounds are administered at about 0.01 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, more preferably at about 0.1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, even more preferably at about 0.5 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg. A number of animal models of are useful for establishing a range of therapeutically effective doses of BTK inhibitor compounds for treating any of the foregoing diseases. For example, dosing of BTK inhibitor compounds for treating an autoimmune disease can be assessed in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. In this model, arthritis is induced in Balb/c mice by administering anti-collagen antibodies and lipopolysaccharide. See Nandakumar et al. (2003), Am. J. Pathol 163:1827-1837. In another example, dosing of BTK inhibitors for the treatment of B-cell proliferative disorders can be examined in, e.g., a human-to-mouse xenograft model in which human B-cell lymphoma cells (e.g. Ramos cells) are implanted into immunodeficient mice (e.g., “nude” mice) as described in, e.g., Pagel et al. (2005), Clin Cancer Res 11(13):4857-4866. Animal models for treatment of thromboembolic disorders are also known. The therapeutic efficacy of the compound for one of the foregoing diseases can be optimized during a course of treatment. For example, a subject being treated can undergo a diagnostic evaluation to correlate the relief of disease symptoms or pathologies to inhibition of in vivo BTK activity achieved by administering a given dose of a BTK inhibitor. Cellular assays known in the art can be used to determine in vivo activity of BTK in the presence or absence of a BTK inhibitor. For example, since activated BTK is phosphorylated at tyrosine 223 (Y223) and tyrosine 551 (Y551), phospho-specific immunocytochemical staining of P-Y223 or P-Y551-positive cells can be used to detect or quantify activation of Bkt in a population of cells (e.g., by FACS analysis of stained vs unstained cells). See, e.g., Nisitani et al. (1999), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA 96:2221-2226. Thus, the amount of the BTK inhibitor inhibitor compound that is administered to a subject can be increased or decreased as needed so as to maintain a level of BTK inhibition optimal for treating the subject's disease state. When the compounds described herein are co-administered with another agent (e.g., as sensitizing agents), the effective amount may be less than when the agent is used alone. If desired, the effective daily dose of the active compound may be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day, optionally, in unit dosage forms. Preferred dosing is one administration per day. The invention further provides a unit dosage form (such as a tablet or capsule) comprising a compound of any one of Formula (I) and Formula (II) or a specific compound described herein, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in a therapeutically effective amount for the treatment of an immune or inflammatory disorder, such as one of the particular immune disorders or inflammatory disorders described herein. In addition, articles of manufacture including packaging material, a compound or composition or pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof provided herein, which is effective for inhibiting the activity of tyrosine kinase(s), such as BTK, within the packaging material, and a label that indicates that the compound or composition, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutically active metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, is used for inhibiting the activity of tyrosine kinase(s), such as BTK, are provided. Combination Treatments The BTK inhibitor compositions described herein can also be used in combination with other well known therapeutic reagents that are selected for their therapeutic value for the condition to be treated. In general, the compositions described herein and, in embodiments where combinational therapy is employed, other agents do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and may, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, have to be administered by different routes. The determination of the mode of administration and the advisability of administration, where possible, in the same pharmaceutical composition, is well within the knowledge of the skilled clinician. The initial administration can be made according to established protocols known in the art, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration can be modified by the skilled clinician. In certain instances, it may be appropriate to administer at least one BTK inhibitor compound described herein in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the BTK inhibitor compounds described herein is nausea, then it may be appropriate to administer an anti-nausea agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein may be enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant may have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit experienced by a patient may be increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient may experience a synergistic benefit. The particular choice of compounds used will depend upon the diagnosis of the attending physicians and their judgment of the condition of the patient and the appropriate treatment protocol. The compounds may be administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the disease, disorder, or condition, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of compounds used. The determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is well within the knowledge of the skilled physician after evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient. It is known to those of skill in the art that therapeutically-effective dosages can vary when the drugs are used in treatment combinations. Methods for experimentally determining therapeutically-effective dosages of drugs and other agents for use in combination treatment regimens are described in the literature. For example, the use of metronomic dosing, i.e., providing more frequent, lower doses in order to minimize toxic side effects, has been described extensively in the literature Combination treatment further includes periodic treatments that start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical management of the patient. For combination therapies described herein, dosages of the co-administered compounds will of course vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In addition, when co-administered with one or more biologically active agents, the compound provided herein may be administered either simultaneously with the biologically active agent(s), or sequentially. If administered sequentially, the attending physician will decide on the appropriate sequence of administering protein in combination with the biologically active agent(s). In any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (i.e. compounds of the invention) may be administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents may be provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (by way of example only, either as a single pill or as two separate pills). One of the therapeutic agents may be given in multiple doses, or both may be given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses may vary from more than zero weeks to less than four weeks. In addition, the combination methods, compositions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only two agents; the use of multiple therapeutic combinations are also envisioned. It is understood that the dosage regimen to treat, prevent, or ameliorate the condition(s) for which relief is sought, can be modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These factors include the disorder from which the subject suffers, as well as the age, weight, sex, diet, and medical condition of the subject. Thus, the dosage regimen actually employed can vary widely and therefore can deviate from the dosage regimens set forth herein. The pharmaceutical agents which make up the combination therapy disclosed herein may be a combined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for substantially simultaneous administration. The pharmaceutical agents that make up the combination therapy may also be administered sequentially, with either therapeutic compound being administered by a regimen calling for two-step administration. The two-step administration regimen may call for sequential administration of the active agents or spaced-apart administration of the separate active agents. The time period between the multiple administration steps may range from, a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the properties of each pharmaceutical agent, such as potency, solubility, bioavailability, plasma half-life and kinetic profile of the pharmaceutical agent. Circadian variation of the target molecule concentration may also determine the optimal dose interval. In addition, the compounds described herein also may be used in combination with procedures that may provide additional or synergistic benefit to the patient. By way of example only, patients are expected to find therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit in the methods described herein, wherein pharmaceutical composition of a compound disclosed herein and/or combinations with other therapeutics are combined with genetic testing to determine whether that individual is a carrier of a mutant gene that is known to be correlated with certain diseases or conditions. The compounds described herein and combination therapies can be administered before, during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound can vary. Thus, for example, the compounds can be used as a prophylactic and can be administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. The compounds and compositions can be administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. The administration of the compounds can be initiated within the first 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms, within the first 6 hours of the onset of the symptoms, or within 3 hours of the onset of the symptoms. The initial administration can be via any route practical, such as, for example, an intravenous injection, a bolus injection, infusion over 5 minutes to about 5 hours, a pill, a capsule, transdermal patch, buccal delivery, and the like, or combination thereof. A compound should be administered as soon as is practicable after the onset of a disease or condition is detected or suspected, and for a length of time necessary for the treatment of the disease, such as, for example, from about 1 month to about 3 months. The length of treatment can vary for each subject, and the length can be determined using the known criteria. For example, the compound or a formulation containing the compound can be administered for at least 2 weeks, between about 1 month to about 5 years, or from about 1 month to about 3 years. Where the subject is suffering from or at risk of suffering from an autoimmune disease, an inflammatory disease, or an allergy disease, a BTK inhibitor compound can be used in with one or more of the following therapeutic agents in any combination: immunosuppressants (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporin, rapamicin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mercaptopurine, mycophenolate, or FTY720), glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone, cortisone acetate, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, betamethasone, triamcinolone, beclometasone, fludrocortisone acetate, deoxycorticosterone acetate, aldosterone), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., salicylates, arylalkanoic acids, 2-arylpropionic acids, N-arylanthranilic acids, oxicams, coxibs, or sulphonanilides), Cox-2-specific inhibitors (e.g., valdecoxib, celecoxib, or rofecoxib), leflunomide, gold thioglucose, gold thiomalate, aurofin, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquinine, minocycline, TNF-.alpha. binding proteins (e.g., infliximab, etanercept, or adalimumab), abatacept, anakinra, interferon-β, interferon-γ, interleukin-2, allergy vaccines, antihistamines, antileukotrienes, beta-agonists, theophylline, or anticholinergics. Where the subject is suffering from or at risk of suffering from a B-cell proliferative disorder (e.g., plasma cell myeloma), the subjected can be treated with a BTK inhibitor compound in any combination with one or more other anti-cancer agents. In some embodiments, one or more of the anti-cancer agents are proapoptotic agents.

General Synthetic Procedures The following schemes and experimental procedures are representative of the methods that can be used to prepare compounds of Formula (I) and are not intended to be limiting. Starting materials may be obtained by procedures described in the schemes, by procedures well known to one of ordinary skill in organic chemistry, and/or may be obtained commercially. During any of the following synthetic sequences it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This can be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley & Sons, 2006. The need for, and the selection of, appropriate protecting groups can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. The compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared as single enantiomer or as a mixture of individual enantiomers which includes racemic mixtures. Methods to obtain preferentially a single enantiomer from a mixture of individual enantiomers or a racemic mixture are well known to those ordinarily skilled in the art of organic chemistry. Such methods include but are not limited to preferential crystallization of diastereomeric salts (e.g. tartrate or camphor sulfonate), covalent derivatization by a chiral, non-racemic reagent followed by separation of the resulting diastereomers by common methods (e.g. crystallization, chromatographic separation, or distillation) and chemical reversion to scalemic compound, Simulated Moving Bed technology, or high/medium-pressure liquid chromatography or supercritical fluid chromatography employing a chiral stationary phase. These techniques may be performed on the final compounds of Formula (I) or on any intermediates to compounds of Formula (I) which bear a stereogenic center. Also, to facilitate separation by any of the methods described above, the compounds of Formula (I) or any intermediates to the compounds of Formula (I) which bear a stereogenic center may be transiently reacted with an achiral reagent, separated, and then reverted to scalemic compound by standard synthetic techniques. Compounds of formula (I) may be prepared as described in Scheme A. Compounds of the formula A1, prepared as described in Scheme C, are condensed with hydrazines of the formula A2, wherein the ring B is an optionally substituted 4-8 membered nitrogen-containing heterocycle and P is an appropriate amine protecting group (e.g. benzyloxycarbonyl, t-butoxycarbonyl, acetyl, or diphenylmethylene), to afford pyrazoles of the formula A3. Hydrazines of the formula A2 are commercially available or may be prepared as described in Schemes G-I. Compound A4 may be obtained by deprotection of the amine employing conditions such as catalytic hydrogenation in the case of benzyloxycarbonyl protection or trifluoroacetic acid in the case of t-butoxycarbonyl. Subsequent hydrolysis of the nitrile to afford carboxamides of the formula A5 may be accomplished by heating compounds A4 in the presence of strong base (e.g. sodium hydroxide) or strong acid (e.g. sulfuric acid). Alternatively, compounds of the formula A3 may be transformed to A5 directly under these conditions. In certain embodiments, compound A5 is then reacted with cyanogen bromide in a polar solvent (e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide) in the presence of an inorganic base (e.g. potassium carbonate) to afford compounds of the formula A6.1. Similarly as described in Scheme B, amine A5 is reacted with bromoacetonitrile to provide compounds of the formula B1.

The following illustrate the synthesis of various compounds of the present invention. Additional compounds within the scope of this invention may be prepared using the methods illustrated in these Examples, either alone or in combination with techniques generally known in the art. Experiments were generally carried out under inert atmosphere (nitrogen or argon), particularly in cases where oxygen- or moisture-sensitive reagents or intermediates were employed. Commercial solvents and reagents were generally used without further purification, including anhydrous solvents where appropriate. Mass spectrometry data is reported from either liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) instrumentation. Chemical shifts for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data are expressed in parts per million (ppm, δ) referenced to residual peaks from the deuterated solvents employed.

Example 167 In Vitro Pharmacology Human BTK LanthaScreen Assay TR-FRET LanthaScreen assays were performed by incubating a dilution series of inhibitor concentrations with 50 μM ATP, 100 nM FAM-Srctide peptide substrate (5FAM-GEEPLYWSFPAKKK-NH2, SEQ ID NO.: 1, Molecular Devices, RP7595) and 70 pM of human full-length BTK Kinase (expressed in Sf9 insect cells and purified in-house). The assays were performed with and without pre-incubating the inhibitors with the enzyme for 60 minutes before starting the kinase reaction by adding ATP and the peptide substrate. Samples containing enzyme but no inhibitor were included to determine the maximal extent of reaction. Samples containing no enzyme served as the negative control. The kinase reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes before stopping the kinase activity by the addition of 15 mM EDTA. The extent of peptide phosphorylation by BTK was detected using a Terbium-conjugated anti-phospho-Tyrosine antibody (Tb-PT66 antibody, Invitrogen # PV3557). Phosphorylation of peptide substrate was measured by determining the ratio of 520/495 nm on an Envision Multi-label Reader (Perkin Elmer) and IC50 values were calculated by fitting the data to a four-parameter equation using XLFit4 (IDBS).

For each inhibitor tested, inhibition of histamine release is normalized as a percentage of control histamine based on the formula: % of Control=100×(A−B)/(C−B) where A is the histamine from wells containing inhibitor and anti-IgE antibody, B is the histamine from wells without anti-IgE antibody (minimum histamine) and C is the histamine from wells containing anti-IgE antibody but no inhibitor (maximum). Inhibition curves and IC50 values are determined using Excel-fit. Human EGFR LanthaScreen Selectivity Assay TR-FRET LanthaScreen assays were performed by incubating a dilution series of inhibitor concentrations with 20 μM ATP, 100 nM peptide substrate (FITC-C6-KKAEEEEYFELVAKK-NH2 (SEQ ID NO.: 2, American Peptide, #333778) and 600 pM of human EGFR kinase domain (Invitrogen). The assays were performed with and without pre-incubating the inhibitors with the enzyme for 60 minutes before starting the kinase reaction by adding ATP and the peptide substrate. Samples containing enzyme but no inhibitor were included to determine the maximal extent of reaction. Samples containing no enzyme served as the negative control. The kinase reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes before stopping the kinase activity by the addition of 15 mM EDTA. The extent of peptide phosphorylation by EGFR was detected using a Terbium-conjugated anti-phospho-Tyrosine antibody (Tb-PT66 antibody, Invitrogen # PV3557). Phosphorylation of peptide substrate was measured by determining the ratio of 520/495 nm on an Envision Multi-label Reader (Perkin Elmer) and IC50 values were calculated by fitting the data to a four-parameter equation using XLFit4 (IDBS).

BTK inhibitors were prepared in methylcellulose tween and mice were dosed QD with compounds starting on day−1. Mice were euthanized and serum collected 6 days post-NP-Ficoll immunization. Sera from immunized mice were then tested in an ELISA to measure NP-specific IgM and IgG3 titers. Briefly, to assess NP-specific antibody titers Nunc Maxi-Sorp plates (VWR International) were coated overnight at room temperature with 20 μg/mL of BSA:NP (Biosearch Technologies). Plates were washed with PBS Tween 0.05% buffer (PBS-T) and blocked with PBS containing 0.5% gelatin for 2 hours. Serum samples were then diluted in PBS-T and incubated for 1 hour. Bound antibody was detected using goat anti-mouse IgM−HRP or IgG3-HRP antibodies (Southern Biotech) diluted in PBS-T. ELISA plates were developed using TMB Sure Blue reagent (Kirkegaard & Perry Labs), reactions were stopped by adding 1.0M sulfuric acid to sample wells and absorbances assessed at 450 nm on a Spectramax Plus 384 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Mouse Collage-Induced Arthritis (ClA) Model of Arthritis Arthritis was induced by immunizing DBA/1 mice with bovine type II collagen (CII) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant and by a boost 21 days later with CII emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Efficacy was assessed in a semi-therapeutic dosing regimen, which involved assignment to treatment groups when 10% of the mice showed disease symptoms. Mice were dosed orally one a day. Disease severity was evaluated by scoring all four paws for each animal, with a maximum possible score being 16 according to the following classification: 0, no arthritis; 1, one or two swollen digits; 2, three or more swollen digits or mild to moderate swelling of the entire paw; 3, extensive swelling of the entire paw; 4, resolution of swelling, ankylosis of the paw. At the end of the study, all four paws from each animal were collected for microscopic analysis. Tissue samples were decalcified and embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 6 μm, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and examined microscopically. Each section from each paw was examined for the presence of arthritis, and the severity of arthritis, when present, was subjectively scored according to the following criteria: Grade 0, normal synovial membrane (1-3 synoviocytes thick) and absence of inflammatory cells; Grade 1, synoviocyte hypertrophy, slight synovial membrane fibrosis, and slight to mild inflammatory cell infiltrates into the synovial membrane/articular capsule and/or synovial fluid; Grade 2, grade 1 plus mild to moderate inflammatory cell infiltrates, absence or minimal pannus formation, and superficial cartilage erosion; Grade 3: grade 2 plus marked inflammatory cell infiltrates, fibrosis, and mild to severe erosion of cartilage extending into subchondral bone; Grade 4, loss of joint integrity through erosion or destruction with bone remodeling, fibrosis, and ankylosis. K/BxN Serum Transfer Model of Arthritis In the K/BxN serum transfer model, 6 week old male BTKxid, CBA/CaJ, and C57BL/6 mice, from Jackson Laboratory, were injected with pooled serum from 8-week-old arthritic K/BxN mice (150 μL serum i.p. on days 0 and 2). Hind ankle width was measured with a pocket thickness gauge and the average change in ankle thickness in both ankles was calculated for each animal. Animals were measured Monday through Friday for 14 days. At the end of the study, all four paws from each animal were collected for microscopic analysis. For treatment studies, 6 week old male C57BL/6 mice, from Jackson Laboratory, were injected with pooled serum from 8-week-old arthritic K/BxN mice (150 μL serum i.p. on days 0 and 2). Mice were dosed orally once a day starting on day 0. Hind ankle width was measured with a pocket thickness gauge and the average change in ankle thickness in both ankles was calculated for each animal. Animals were measured Monday through Friday for 14 days. At the end of the study, all four paws from each animal were collected for microscopic analysis as described above.
