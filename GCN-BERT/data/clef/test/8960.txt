(Example 36)
Step 1
To Compound 147 (220 mg, 0.411 mmol) in DMF (2 mL) solution were added cesium carbonate (268 mg, 0.823 mmol) and methyl-2-chloro-2,2-difluoro acetate (0.086 mL, 0.823 mmol), the mixture was stirred under nitrogen atmosphere at 60Â°C for 15 minutes. Water was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 148 (94 mg, 39% yield) as yellow foam.
