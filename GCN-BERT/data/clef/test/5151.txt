Example 2: Preparation of 3,7-dimethoxy-N-methoxyethyl-phenothiazine
3,7-dibromo-N-methoxyethyl-phenothiazine
N-methoxyethyl-phenothiazine (0.251 g, 0.973 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (3 mL). The reaction mixture was cooled in an ice bath and N-bromosuccinimide (0.397 g, 2.23 mmol) was added portion-wise over 10 minutes. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight. Upon completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with water, sodium thiosulfate solution and brine. The organic extracts were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The organic residue was purified by silica gel chromatography using 0-10% ethyl acetate in hexane as eluent to afford the product as a white crystalline solid (332 mg) in 82% yield. The product was further recrystallized from ethanol solution.
