Example I-5 Synthesis of Compound 36
Synthesis of Compound 33
2,4-Diaminobenzoic acid 32 (501.8 mg, 3.3 mmol) was dispersed in ethyl acetate (20 mL) and a solution of potassium carbonate (9.0 g, 66 mmol) in water (20 mL) was added. To the mixture, acryloyl chloride (1 mL, 13 mmol) was carefully added, resulting in the formation of a light brown precipitate. The reacting mixture was then allowed to reach room temperature, lead to the dissolution of the precipitate. After 2 hour, the reaction was complete. The organic layer was discarded and the aqueous layer was acidified with 5% hydrochloric acid, making a precipitate appear at pH4. The precipitate was filtered, washed with petroleum ether and diluted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and removed in vacuo. The solid residue was suspended in water, filtered, and washed thoroughly with diethyl ether to give product 33 (670.2 mg, 78%) as a gray powder. LC-MS m/z (ES+), 261.09 (M+H)+.
