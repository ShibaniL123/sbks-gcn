I. Hermetic metal pipe joint, especially for pipes used for pumping fluids and well slngs, comprising a male element with at least one external tapered thread and a female element with complementary internal threads, the end part of said finale e 1 element beyond each thread havoc a coaxJoal tapered seal surface and an Internal seat surface, also ta ered sald surfaces being interacting with similar seal and seat surfaces on said female element, the length of the seal surface of the female along the generatrix be!ng greater than that of the co-respondent seal surface of the male element, said joint being oharacterised by the fact that said two seal surfaces of the male and female elements have a taper between 6.25 and 9o25%, the length of the surface of the male element which comes into contact with the corresponding surface of • the female element being between 0.5 and 2.5 am. 2, Joint as claimed in Claim i in which the taper on the seat surfaces on the male element and on the corresponding female element is between 5 and I0° to a planeperpendicular to the joint axis, said surfaces operating only after interaction and energization of the threads and the seal surfaces. 5. Joint as claimed in Claims ! and 2 where the threads are of the hooked type. 4. Joint as lalmed in Claims I and 2 where the threads are of the Antares type. 5. Joint as claimed in Claims I to 4 comprising a supplementary seal device consisting of a seal ring of plastics material appropriately positioned between the two seat surfaces of the male and female elements in a housing formed on the seat st rfece of the female element. 6. Pipe joint as claimed in Claims 1,2 and 4, ereln it is made of steel alloys selected fram Cr-Mn-V and Cr-Mo steels eor, halnlng V, Ti and Nb, said steels being quenched and tempera4 and ha ±ng a tempered martenslte structure. ' 7. Pipe Joint as claimed in Claims !, 2 and 3 wherein it is made of a material selected from stainless steel and Ni-based alloys, possibly in association with antl-selzure treatments such as implants" of noble metals or hardening elements or electrolytlcel deposits of hardening and/or lubricating methyls. Hermetic metal pipe joint substantially as herein described particularly with reference to the accompanier drawings. Dated this q2th day of Ootober, 1989. / 'L S 'J. (O. P. A JA) of D. P.
