TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a nitrile rubber composition which gives a cross-linked rubber which is excellent in moldability (in particular, fluidity when simultaneously molding and cross-linking) and compression set resistance and a cross-linked rubber which is obtained by using that nitrile rubber composition. BACKGROUD ART In the past, nitrile rubber (acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer rubber), taking advantage of its oil resistance, mechanical characteristics, chemical resistance, etc., has been used as a material for hoses, tubes, and other rubber parts for automobiles. Further, hydrogenated nitrile rubber (hydrogenated acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer rubber) which is obtained by hydrogenating the carbon-carbon double bonds in the polymer main chain of nitrile rubber is further excellent in heat resistance, so is used for seals, belts, hoses, diaphrams, and other rubber parts. As such a nitrile rubber composition, for example, Patent Document 1 proposes a nitrile rubber composition which contains a hydrogenated nitrile rubber which has α,β-ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid monoester monomer units, a polyamine-based cross-linking agent, and a basic cross-linking accelerator. According to the nitrile rubber composition which is described in this Patent Document 1, a cross-linked rubber which is excellent in heat resistance, bending fatigue resistance, etc. and is small in compression set is obtained. On the other hand, in recent years, the market has been making higher demands on quality, and rubber parts which have complicated shapes have come to be sought. However, the nitrile rubber composition which is described in the above Patent Document 1 is not sufficient in fluidity at the time of cross-linking, so when cross-linking simultaneously with molding in a mold which has a complicated shape so as to obtain a rubber part which has a complicated shape, the composition cannot flow to the furthest extents of the mold and therefore there was the problem that it was not possible to obtain a rubber part which has a complicated shape with a good yield (with little occurrence of defects). PRIOR ART DOCUMENTS PATENT DOCUMENTS Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Publication No. 2001-55471A SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION The present invention has as its object the provision of a nitrile rubber composition which gives a cross-linked rubber which is excellent in moldability (in particular, fluidity when simultaneously molding and cross-linking) and compression set resistance and a cross-linked rubber which is obtained by using the nitrile rubber composition. MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS The present inventors engaged in in-depth research to achieve the above object and as a result discovered that by mixing, into a carboxyl group-containing nitrile rubber, a liquid nitrile rubber and a polyamine cross-linking agent, the above object can be achieved, and thereby completed the present invention. That is, according to the present invention, there is provided a nitrile rubber composition which contains a carboxyl group-containing nitrile rubber (A), a liquid nitrile rubber (B), and a polyamine-based cross-linking agent (C).

Preferably, the nitrile rubber composition of the present invention further contains a basic cross-linking accelerator. Further, according to the present invention, there is provided a cross-linked rubber comprised of the above nitrile rubber composition which has been cross-linked. EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, there are provided a nitrile rubber composition which gives a cross-linked rubber which is excellent in moldability (in particular, fluidity when simultaneously molding and cross-linking) and compression set resistance and a cross-linked rubber which is obtained by cross-linking the nitrile rubber composition and which is provided with the above characteristics. In particular, according to the nitrile rubber composition of the present invention, the fluidity when simultaneously molding and cross-linking is excellent, so by using the above composition, it is possible to obtain, as the obtained cross-linked rubber, a rubber part which has a complicated shape with a good yield (with little occurrence of defects).

If the content of the α,β-ethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomer units is too small, the obtained cross-linked rubber is liable to fall in oil resistance, while conversely if too large, the cold resistance may fall. The carboxyl group-containing monomer is not particularly limited so long as a monomer which can be copolymerized with an α,β-ethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomer and which has at least one unsubstituted (free) carboxyl group which is not esterified etc. By using a carboxyl group-containing monomer, a carboxyl group can be introduced into a nitrile rubber. As the carboxyl group-containing monomer used in the present invention, for example, an α,β-ethylenically unsaturated monocarboxylic acid monomer, α,β-ethylenically unsaturated polyvalent carboxylic acid monomer, α,β-ethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic acid monoester monomer, etc. may be mentioned. Further, the carboxyl group-containing monomer also includes monomers where the carboxyl groups of these monomers form carboxylic acid salts. Furthermore, an anhydride of an α,β-ethylenically unsaturated polyvalent carboxylic acid also causes the acid anhydride groups to cleave apart after copolymerization to form carboxyl groups, so can be used as a carboxyl group-containing monomer.

The content of the carboxyl group-containing monomer units is preferably 0.1 to 20 wt% with respect to the total monomer units, more preferably 0.2 to 15 wt%, furthermore preferably 0.5 to 10 wt%.

If the content of the conjugated diene monomer units is too small, the obtained cross-linked rubber is liable to fall in rubber elasticity, while conversely if too large, the heat resistance or chemical resistance stability may be impaired. Note that the content of the conjugated diene monomer units is the content including also the hydrogenated part when performing the later explained hydrogenation. Further, the carboxyl group-containing nitrile rubber used in the present invention may be copolymerized together with the α,β-ethylenically unsaturated nitrile monomer, carboxyl group-containing monomer, and conjugated diene monomer, other monomer which can be copolymerized with these.

Liquid Nitrile Rubber (B) The liquid nitrile rubber (B) used in the present invention is a nitrile rubber which has a liquid state at 25°C (has fluidity at 25°C). The liquid nitrile rubber (B) used in the present invention, for example, is one where the Mooney viscosity which is measured based on JIS K6300 is usually 1 or less or one where the viscosity is too low and the Mooney viscosity cannot be measured.

If the content of the polyamine cross-linking agent (C) is too small, the nitrile rubber composition becomes insufficient in cross-linkability and the obtained cross-linked rubber is liable to deteriorate in normal physical properties and compression set resistance. On the other hand, if the content is too large, the polyamine cross-linking agent is liable to bleed out from the cross-linked rubber.

The nitrile rubber composition of the present invention is prepared by mixing the above ingredients in a preferably nonaqueous system. As the method of suitably preparing the nitrile rubber composition of the present invention, mixing the ingredients other than the polyamine cross-linking agent (C) and other ingredients which are unstable against heat by a Bambury mixer, inner mixer, kneading, or other mixing machine for primary mixing, then transferring the mixture to open rolls etc. to add the polyamine cross-linking agent (C) and other ingredients which are unstable against heat for secondary mixing etc. may be mentioned. Note that, the primary mixing is usually performed at 10 to 200°C, preferably 30 to 180°C in temperature, for 1 minute to 1 hour, preferably 1 minute to 30 minutes, while the secondary mixing is usually performed at 10 to 100°C, preferably 20 to 60°C in temperature, for 1 minute to 1 hour, preferably 1 minute to 30 minutes. In the nitrile rubber composition of the present invention, the compound Mooney viscosity (ML1+4, 100°C) is preferably 20 to 400, more preferably 40 to 200, particularly preferably 60 to 150. Cross-Linked Rubber The cross-linked rubber of the present invention is one obtained by cross-linking the above-mentioned nitrile rubber composition of the present invention. The cross-linked rubber of the present invention can be produced by using the nitrile rubber composition of the present invention, for example, using a molding machine which corresponds to the desired shape, for example, an extruder, injection molding machine, press, rolls, etc. for molding, heating to cause a cross-linking reaction and thereby fixing the shape as a cross-linked product. In this case, it is possible to mold the rubber, then cross-link it and possible to cross-link it simultaneously with molding, but in the present invention, since it is possible to streamline the production process and, furthermore, produce a rubber part which has a complicated shape with a good yield (with little occurrence of defects), cross-linking it simultaneously with molding is preferable. In particular, the above-mentioned nitrile rubber composition of the present invention is low in lowest torque value (ML) when simultaneously molding and cross-linking and therefore is excellent in fluidity when simultaneously molding and cross-linking. Here, FIG. 1 is a graph which shows the changes in Mooney viscosity at the time of cross-linking of a nitrile rubber composition as measured by a vibration type rheometer (graph which shows cross-linking characteristics of nitrile rubber composition). FIG. 1 shows the cross-linking time and changes in torque (changes in Mooney viscosity) when cross-linking a nitrile rubber composition (corresponding to "when simultaneously molding and cross-linking"). As shown in FIG. 1, if heating the nitrile rubber composition (starting cross-linking), softening of the nitrile rubber composition first causes the torque to drop. After the torque reaches the lowest value (ML), the torque rises. Here, the lowest value (ML) of the torque is an indicator of the fluidity of the nitrile rubber composition. The smaller the lowest value (ML) of the torque, the better the fluidity can be said to be. On the other hand, the highest value (MH) of the torque is a value which serves as an indicator of the cross-linking degree. Furthermore, t10 and t90 show the time until the torque rises 10% from the ML when the difference between the lowest value and highest value of the torque (MH-ML) is made 100% and the time until the torque rises 90% from the ML respectively. Further, according to the present invention, when using such a nitrile rubber composition of the present invention (nitrile rubber composition which is low in lowest torque value (ML) and excellent in fluidity when simultaneously molding and cross-linking) and using a mold wich has a complicated shape to simultaneously mold and cross-link the rubber, it is possible to make the nitrile rubber composition of the present invention suitably flow at the inside of the mold until the furthest extents and thereby possible to obtain cross-linked rubber which has a complicated shape with a good yield (with little occurrence of defects). Note that, when molding and cross-linking, the molding and cross-linking temperature is preferably 120 to 220°C, more preferably 150 to 200°C. Further, the molding and cross-linking time is preferably 5 minutes to 5 hours, more preferably 10 minutes to 1 hour. Note that, depending on the shape, size, etc. of the cross-linked rubber, sometimes, even if the surface is cross-linked, the inside part is not sufficiently cross-linked, so it is possible to further heat the rubber for secondary cross-linking. As the heating method, press heating, steam heating, oven heating, hot air heating, or another general method which is used for cross-linking rubber may be suitably selected. The thus obtained cross-linked rubber of the present invention is obtained using the above-mentioned nitrile rubber composition of the present invention, so is excellent in compression set resistance. In particular, as explained above, the nitrile rubber composition of the present invention is low in lowest torque value (ML) and excellent in fluidity when simultaneously molding and cross-linking, can be made to suitably flow inside a mold which has a complicated shape up to the furthest extents, and can give cross-linked rubber which has a complicated shape and is excellent in compression set resistance with a good yield (with little occurrence of defects). For this reason, the cross-linked rubber of the present invention can be used, taking advantage of the above characteristics, for O-rings, packings, diaphragms, oil seals, shaft seals, bearing seals, wellhead seals, air compressor seals, seals for sealing the chlorofluorocabon or fluorohydrocarbons or carbon dioxide used for cooling apparatuses of air-conditioners or compressors for cooling machines for air-conditioning systems, seals for sealing supercritical carbon dioxide or subcritical carbon dioxide used for washing media for precision washing, seals for roller devices (roller bearings, automobile hub units, automobile water pumps, linear guide devices, ball and screws, etc.), valves and valve seats, BOP (blow out preventers), blatters, and other various sealing members; and intake manifold gaskets attached to connecting parts of intake manifolds and cylinder heads, cylinder head gaskets attached to connecting parts of cylinder blocks and cylinder heads, rocker cover gaskets attached to connecting parts of rocker covers and cylinder heads, oil pan gaskets attached to connecting parts of oil pans and cylinder blocks or transmission cases, gaskets for fuel cell separators attached between a pair of housings sandwiching a unit cell provided with anode, electrolyte plates, and cathodes, gaskets for top covers of hard disk drives, and other various types of gaskets; printing rolls, ironmaking rolls, papermaking rolls, industrial rolls, office equipment rolls, and other various types of rolls; flat belts (film core flat belts, cord flat belts, maltilayer flat belts, single piece flat belts, etc.), V-belts (wrapped V-belts, low edge V-belts, etc.), V-ribbed belts (single V-ribbed belts, double V-ribbed belts, wrapped V-ribbed belts, back surface rubber V-ribbed belts, top cog V-ribbed belts etc.), CVT belts, timing belts, toothed belts, conveyor belts, oil immersed belts, and other various types of belts; fuel hoses, turbo air hoses, oil hoses, radiator hoses, heater hoses, water hoses, vacuum brake hoses, control hoses, air-conditioner hoses, brake hoses, power steering hoses, air hoses, marine hoses, risers, flowlines, and other various types of hoses; CVJ boots, propeller shaft boots, constant velocity joint boots, rack and pinion boots, and other various types of boots; cushion materials, dynamic dampers, rubber couplings, air springs, vibration proofing materials, and other damping material rubber parts; dust covers, car interior members, tires, covered cables, shoe soles, electromagnetic wave shields, binders for flexible printed circuit boards and other binders, fuel cell separators, and also other broad applications in the fields of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, fields in contact with food, the electronics field, etc. Among these as well, the cross-linked rubber of the present invention can be suitably used for seal materials, belts, hoses, or gaskets. EXAMPLES Below, examples and comparative examples will be given to explain the present invention more specifically, but the present invention is not limited to these examples. Below, unless particularly indicated, "parts" are based on weight. The methods of testing and evaluating the physical properties and characteristics are as follows: Composition of Carboxyl Group-Containing Highly Saturated Nitrile Rubber The ratio of content of the monomer units which form the carboxyl group-containing highly saturated nitrile rubber were measured by the following method. That is, the ratio of content of the mono n-butyl maleate units was calculated by adding 2-butanone 100 ml to 2 mm square carboxyl group-containing highly saturated nitrile rubber 0.2 g and stirring for 16 hours, then adding ethanol 20 ml and water 10 ml and, while stirring, using a 0.02N hydrous ethanol solution of potassium hydroxide for titration at room temperature by Thymolphthalein as an indicator to thereby find the number of moles of the carboxyl groups with resepct to the carboxyl group-containing nitrile rubber 100 g, and converting the number of moles which were found to the amount of mono n-butyl maleate units. The ratios of content of the 1,3-butadiene units and saturated butadiene units were calculated by using the carboxyl group-containing highly saturated nitrile rubber to measure the iodine values before the hydrogen addition reaction and after the hydrogen addition reaction (according to JIS K 6235). The ratio of content of the acrylonitrile units was calculated in accordance with JIS K6383 by using the Kjeldahl method to measure the nitrogen content in the carboxyl group-containing highly saturated nitrile rubber. Iodine Value The carboxyl group-containing highly saturated nitrile rubber was measured for iodine value in accordance with JIS K 6235. Content of Carboxyl Groups The content of the carboxyl groups was calculated by adding 2-butanone 100 ml to 2 mm square carboxyl group-containing highly saturated nitrile rubber 0.2 g and stirring for 16 hours, then adding ethanol 20 ml and water 10 ml and, while stirring, using a 0.02N hydrous ethanol solution of potassium hydroxide for titration at room temperature by Thymolphthalein as an indicator to thereby find the number of moles of the carboxyl group with respect to 100 g of the carboxyl group-containing highly saturated nitrile rubber (units: ephr). Cross-Linkability Test (Fluidity) The nitrile rubber composition was tested using a rubber vulcanization tester (product name "Moving Die Rheometer MDR", made by Alpha Technologies) according to JIS K6300-2 at 170°C for 30 minutes as conditions for a cross-linkability test, whereupon a cross-linking curve such as shown in FIG. 1 was obtained. Further, from the results of the cross-linkability test, the lowest value (ML) of the torque (units: dN· m), the highest value (MH) of the torque (units: dN·m), t10 (units: min), and t90 (units: min) were measured. Note that, t10 and t90 show the time required for the torque to rise 10% from the lowest torque (ML) when the "lowest value (ML) of the torque - the highest value of the torque (ML)" is made 100% and the time required for the torque to rise 90% respetively. The smaller the lowest value (ML) of the torque, the higher the fluidity in the mold and the better the formability for obtaining a rubber part which has a complicated shape. Normal Physical Properties (Elongation, Tensile Stress, and Hardness) The nitrile rubber composition was placed in a vertical 15 cm, horizontal 15 cm, depth 0.2 cm mold and press formed while applying a press pressure of 10 MPa at 170°C for 20 minutes to obtain sheet-shaped cross-linked rubber. Next, the obtained cross-linked product was transferred to a gear type oven and secondarily cross-linked at 170°C for 4 hours. The obtained sheet-shaped cross-linked rubber was punched out to a No. 3 dumbbell shape to prepare a test piece. Further, the obtained test piece was used in accordance with JIS K6251 to measure the cross-linked rubber for tensile stress (100% tensile stress) and elongation and further in accordance with JIS K6253 using a Durometer Hardness Tester (Type A) to measure the cross-linked rubber for hardness. Note that, the hardness was measured respectively at contact of the probe and after 10 seconds. O-Ring Compression Set Test Using an inside diameter 30 mm, ring diameter 3 mm mold, the nitrile rubber composition was cross-linked at 170°C for 20 minutes under conditions of a press pressure of 5 MPa and was secondarily cross-linked at 170°C for 4 hours to thereby obtain a test piece for an O-ring compression set test. Further, using the obtained test piece, the O-ring compression set was measured in accordance with JIS K6262 under conditions holding the piece at 150°C for 168 hours in a state with the distance between the two flat surfaces which sandwich the O-ring shaped test piece compressed 25% in the ring thickness direction. The smaller this value, the better the compression set resistance. Synthesis Example 1 (Synthesis of Carboxyl Group-Containing Highly Saturated Nitrile Rubber (A1)) To a reactor, ion exchanged water 180 parts, concentration 10 wt% sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate aqueous solution 25 parts, acrylonitrile 36 parts, mono n-butyl maleate 6 parts, and t-dodecyl mercaptan (molecular weight adjuster) 0.5 part were successively charged. The inside gas was replaced with nitrogen three times, then 1,3-butadiene 58 parts was charged. Next, the reactor was held at 5°C, then cumen hydroperoxide (polymerization initiator) 0.1 part was charged. While stirring, the polymerization reaction was continued. At the points of time when the polymerization conversion rate reached 85%, concentration 10 wt% hydroquinone aqueous solution (polymerization terminator) 0.1 part was added to stop the polymerization reaction. Next, at a water temperature 60°C, the residual monomers were removed under reduced pressure to obtain a latex of nitrile rubber (solid content concentration: about 30 wt%). Next, to make the content of palladium with respect to the dry weight of rubber contained in the latex, which is obtained by the above, 1,000 ppm, the autoclave was charged with the latex fo the nitrile rubber and a palladium catalyst (solution of mixture of 1 wt% palladium acetone acetate solution and equal weight of ion exchanged water) and a hydrogen addition reaction was performed at a hydrogen pressure of 3 MPa and temperature of 50°C for 6 hours to obtain a latex of a highly saturated nitrile rubber. To the latex of the obtained nitrile group-containing highly saturated copolymer rubber, two volumes of methanol were added to cause coagulation, then the result was vacuum dried at 60°C for 12 hours to thereby obtain the carboxyl group-containing highly saturated nitrile rubber (A1). The composition of the monomer units of the carboxyl group-containing highly saturated nitrile rubber (A1) was acrylonitrile units 36.0 wt%, mono-n-butyl maleate units 6.0 wt%, 1,3-butadiene units (including hydrogenated parts) 58.0 wt%, the content of carboxyl groups was 0.030 ephr, and, further, iodine value was 10 and the polymer Mooney viscosity [ML1+4, 100°C] was 55.

The results are shown in Table 1. Comparative Example 1 Except for not using the liquid nitrile rubber, the same procedure was followed as in Example 1 to prepare a nitrile rubber composition and the same procedure was followed to evaluate it. The results are shown in Table 1.

In particular, from the results of Examples 1 and 2, it can be said that since the nitrile rubber composition of the present invention is low in the lowest value (ML) of the torque at the time of cross-linking, even when using a mold which has a complicated shape, the composition can flow to the furthest extents of the mold and therefore cross-linked rubber which has a complicated shape can be obtained with a good yield (with little occurrence of defects). On the other hand, when using the carboxyl group-containing nitrile rubber (A), but not mixing in liquid nitrile rubber (B), the lowest value (ML) of the torque at the time of cross-linking was high and the fluidity at the time of cross-linking was poor (Comparative Example 1). Further, when using highly saturated nitrile rubber which does not contain carboxyl groups instead of the carboxyl group-containing nitrile rubber (A), despite mixing in the liquid nitrile rubber (B), the lowest value (ML) of the torque at the time of cross-linking was high, the fluidity at the time of cross-linking was poor, and, furthermore, the obtained cross-linked rubber was poor in compression set resistance (Comparative Example 2).
