A MICRONIZED COMPOSITION THIS INVENTION relates to a micronized composition. In particular the invention relates to a micronized composition, a coated fertilizer, a coated seed, a method of producing a micronized composition and a method of covering a granule. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is well known that micronutrients, such as Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Copper (Cu), Boron (B) and Molybdenum (Mo), are essential for the growth of plants. It has however always been a problem to correct micronutrient deficiencies in soil, with a hassle free, cost effective, single application product or process. Water-soluble micronutrients, for example sulphate and chelate forms of micronutrients, are the optimal agronomical solutions to correct micronutrient deficiencies. Coating these micronutrients onto fertilizer granules would provide the most efficient method of applying micronutrients to the root zone of germinating seeds or sprouting plant material. The inventor is aware of other micronutrient coated fertilizers, however most of these fertilizers are coated with water insoluble sources of micronutrients. Further, most bonding agents contain water which dissolves the materials that are being adhered to. Also, various chemical reactions occurs, which may cause caking, dissolution of the fertilizer granules and degradation of the overall product. The adhesion success of current products are usually temporary and the micronutrients may detach within a short time. Another problem with available products are that they use bonding agents which contain bunker oils or other industrial waste products. These bonding agents are therefore not environmentally friendly and their use may destroy microbial life in the soil, which also plays an important part in the growth of plants. The current invention aims to address the abovementioned problems, and provide an efficient, economically viable and environmentally friendly coated fertilizer. In this specification "micronized" refers to a material which has undergone the process of reducing the average diameter of the solid material's particles.

The invention will now be described, by way of example only with reference to the following drawing(s): DRAWING(S) In the drawing(s): Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of a coated fertilizer granule in accordance with one embodiment of the invention; Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of a coated fertilizer granule in accordance with another embodiment of the invention; Figure 3 shows a distribution graph of one example of the particle size of the micronized composition; Figure 4 shows a distribution graph of another example of the particle size of the micronized composition; Table 1 shows the composition of two examples of coated fertilizers; Table 2 shows the moisture content of the urea coated fertilizer of Table 1 , over a period of time. In the drawings, like reference numerals denote like parts of the invention unless otherwise indicated. EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION In Figure 1 reference numeral 10, generally refers to a coated fertilizer in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The coated fertilizer 10 includes a fertilizer granule 12, a biodegradable bonding agent 14, coating at least a portion of an exterior surface of the fertilizer granule 10 and a micronized composition 16, the micronized composition 16 being associated with the bonding agent 14. The micronized composition 16 includes at least one type of water- soluble micronutrient, a clay binder and a dehydrating agent, the at least one water-soluble micronutrient, clay binder and dehydrating agent being micronized. In this example the micronized composition is micronized to average particle sizes smaller than 10 μΓΠ in diameter. The clay binder is in the form of sodium activated bentonite. The sodium activated bentonite has a typical chemical composition of 54.85% Si02, 17.00% AI2O3, 5.84% Fe203, 1.86% CaO, 3.47% MgO, 1.05% K20, 2.74% Na20 and 12.58% LOI. The sodium activated bentonite has a typical mineral content of about 81 % Montmorillonite, 12% Quartz, 1 % Calcite, 1 % Plagioclase, 3% Mica and 2% Zeolite. The dehydrating agent is operable to induce a state of dryness in its vicinity. In this example the dehydrating agent is in the form of Calcium Oxide (CaO). In this example the at least one type of water-soluble micronutrient is in the form of a water-soluble form of Zinc, specifically it is in the form of Zinc Sulphate. The micronized composition is in the form of a dry powder. In a specific embodiment the micronized composition includes 75 % (w/w) water-soluble micronutrients, 19%(w/w) sodium activated bentonite and 6% (w/w) CaO. In this example the fertilizer granule is in the form of an urea fertilizer. The bonding agent 14 is in the form of a lignosulphonate. Specifically in the form of a concentrated lignosulphonate solution made from natural wood. In this example the micronized composition 16 is adhered to the biodegradable bonding agent 14. As can be seen in Figure 1 , the bonding agent 14 polymerizes around the fertilizer granule 12 and does not impregnate the fertilizer granule 12. The ratio of bonding agent 14 to micronized composition 16 is approximately 1v/v:2w/w. The coated fertilizer 10 in this example is produced by adding a plurality of fertilizer granules to a blender and then spraying the biodegradable bonding agent 14, onto the fertilizer granules in the blender, to produce coated granules. The Zinc Sulphate, sodium activated bentonite and CaO is micronized to produce a micronized composition. The Zinc Sulphate, sodium activated bentonite and CaO are micronized by introducing them into a pulverizer through a grate. They are then pulverized in a high shear high impact mill and then discharged via a crew auger to a bag house from where it is bagged. The micronized composition is then added to the coated granules in the same blender, such as a ribbon batch blender or paddle blender. The coated fertilizer may be bagged immediately, or be allowed to air before being bagged. In order to provide a stable coated fertilizer, the coated fertilizer must dry quickly, the micro-nutrients must completely adhere to the fertilizer granule and preferably the coated fertilizer must not be sticky, and not clump together. Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of a coated fertilizer granule 10 in accordance with another embodiment of the invention. In this example it is shown that the bonding agent 14 forms a layer which is between 10 and 15 μΓΠ thick (marked A), around the fertilizer granule 12. The micronized composition 16 is of average particle sizes smaller than 10 μίτι, which is dispersed within the bonding agent 14 layer. Figure 3 shows a particle size distribution graph of one example of the micronized composition. In this example the average particle size is 10.748 μίτι and 90% of the particles are smaller than 40 μητ Figure 4 shows a particle size distribution graph of another example of the micronized composition. In this example the average particle size is 2.915μΓη and 90% of the particles are smaller than 10 μητ Table 1 shows a table indicating two examples of coated fertilizers in accordance with the invention. The urea coated fertilizer was tested for moisture content over a period of time. The results of this test is shown in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the moisture content stabilizes at about 0.60% within 24 hours. The inventor believes that the invention provides a new coated fertilizer, which is produced in one blender and in a single process. The coated fertilizer further does not require any anti-caking agent and is self curing thereby eliminating the need to dry the coated fertilizer, the coated fertilizer also remains dry for an extended period. Further the method of coating the fertilizer granules allows for complete adhesion of the micronutrients to the fertilizer granule. The invention also provides for new micronutrient coated seeds.
