TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a ship ballast water treatment system, and more particularly, to a ship ballast water treatment system, which can sterilize ballast water stored in a plurality of ballast tanks disposed in a ship and receiving seawater to improve stability of the ship. BACKGROUND ART Generally, ships such as LNG carriers, LPG carriers, container ships, bulk carriers, and tankers are designed to transport cargo in navigation. Thus, when cargo is unloaded from a ship, the center of gravity of the ship can be shifted upwards, causing instability of the ship. In other words, when the draft (that is, the depth to which a ship is immersed when bearing a given load) becomes shallow by unloading cargo from the ship, the degree of hogging (referring to upward bending of a ship as the center of the ship is raised while the bow and the stern are lowered due to heavier weights thereof by intensively loading cargo at the bow and the stem of the ship) increases during navigation, and shearing force and longitudinal bending moment applied to the ship also increase. In addition, during navigation, the ship can be exposed to impact of waves striking the bottom of the ship, that is, a slamming phenomenon, and also suffers from a propeller racing phenomenon in which the propeller is not fully submerged in water and emerges from a water surface, causing decrease in propulsion performance or increase in load fluctuation on the propeller and main engines, and a problem of deterioration in maneuverability due to insufficient submersion of a rudder in the water. Accordingly, in order to resolve such problems, ships such as LNG carriers, LPG carriers, container ships, bulk carriers, and tankers are provided with a plurality of ballast tanks storing seawater in order to improve stability of the ships. Herein, the water stored in the ballast tank is referred to as ballast water. Ballast water serves to provide stable adjustment of draft and trim (defined as a longitudinal inclination of a ship) depending upon the amount of cargo loaded on the ship. As described above, if ballast water is not supplied into the ship after cargo is completely unloaded from the ship, it is difficult for the ship to maintain a sufficient draft only with an inherent weight thereof. As a result, the bow of the ship can severely emerge from the water surface, or the propeller of the ship can be insufficiently submerged in the seawater, thereby causing bow slamming, deterioration of propulsion performance, or deterioration in maneuverability. Therefore, it is necessary for ships to use'the ballast water. However, use of ballast water provides a problem. That is, marine contamination can occur due to microorganisms or marine organisms in the course of supplying or discharging the ballast water into or from the ballast tanks. That is, when ballast water supplied into a ship in one nation is discharged therefrom in another nation having a completely different environment, various foreign substances, microorganisms, viruses, and other organic materials of the one nation can disturb the marine ecosystem of the other nation. In consideration of such danger, strengthened international regulations on ballast water and sediments, enforced starting in 2009, require that ballast water be discharged only after sterilization of 99% microorganisms in the ballast water in order to prevent propagation of toxic microorganisms included in the ballast water. As such, the strengthened international regulations on ballast water and sediments increase difficulty in treatment of ballast water and promote development of various techniques related to a ballast water treatment apparatus. Among conventional techniques, in a conventional filtration type ballast water treatment apparatus, underwater creatures such as plankton are deposited. In order to remove the deposited underwater creatures, the apparatus must be disassembled before cleaning, thereby providing a complicated cleaning process and difficulty in removal of toxic viruses other than some plankton. Further, in a ballast water treatment apparatus wherein sodium hypochlorite generated through electrolysis of seawater is added to ballast water for sterilization of the ballast water, only some microorganisms can be removed through an indirect method, thereby providing low sterilization efficiency and difficulty in control of a sterilization material. Further, a ballast water treatment apparatus separately employing a filtration device and an electrolysis device performs sterilization of ballast water through many processes, thereby requiring a very complicated operation mechanism and a large space. Moreover, this apparatus can sterilize some microorganisms through an indirect method, thereby providing low sterilization efficiency and difficulty in control of a sterilization material.

Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Like components will be denoted by like reference numerals throughout the drawings. FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a ship ballast water treatment system according to one embodiment of the present invention; FIG. 2 is a plan view of the ship ballast water treatment system of FIG. 1, in which an ozone generating unit is disposed on a deck; FIG. 3 is a schematic diagram of main components of the ship ballast water treatment system of FIG. 1; and FIG. 4 schematically shows an installation location of the ozone generating unit and a double-pipe corresponding to an ozone supply channel in the ship ballast water treatment system of FIG. 1. Referring to these drawings, a ship ballast water treatment system 1 according to one embodiment of the invention includes: an ozone bubbling unit 100 disposed inside a conduit L through which ballast water flows and converting ozone supplied thereto into bubbles; an ozone supply channel 200 connected at one end thereof to the ozone bubbling unit 100 and supplying the ozone to the ozone bubbling unit 100 therethrough; a seawater pumping unit 300 provided to the conduit L while being coupled at one end thereof to the ozone bubbling unit 100, and pumping the ballast water in the conduit L into the ozone bubbling unit 100; and an ozone generating unit 400 disposed on a deck D of the ship. As shown in FIG. 1, the ozone bubbling unit 100 is disposed inside the conduit L and converts ozone supplied thereto into ozone microbubbles using seawater while diffusively discharging the ozone microbubbles such that the ozone microbubbles can be dissolved in a wide surface area in the ballast water. In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 3, the ozone bubbling unit 100 includes a bubble nozzle 110 connected at a left side thereof to the seawater pumping unit 300 and converting the supplied ozone into ozone microbubbles using seawater; and a spreading unit 120 provided to an outlet of the bubble nozzle 110 and spreading the ozone microbubbles. As shown in FIG. 3, a pump 310 is detachably coupled to the bubble nozzle 110 of the ozone bubbling unit 100, and ozone generated in an ozone generating unit (see FIG. 2) flows into the bubble nozzle 110 through an ozone supply channel 200. In this embodiment, the bubble nozzle 110 is provided therein with an ozone flow passage (not shown) communicating with the ozone supply channel 200, and a seawater flow passage (not shown) communicating with the pump 310. In addition, a bottleneck portion having a narrower diameter than other portions of the seawater flow passage is formed in region of the seawater flow passage, at which the ozone flow passage meets the seawater flow passage. In the bottleneck portion, a negative pressure is generated and forces the supplied ozone to be suctioned from the ozone flow passage into the seawater flow passage such that the ozone is discharged together with the seawater through the outlet of the bubble nozzle. Furthermore, the outlet of the bubble nozzle 110 may be provided with a bubble layer (not shown) having a plurality of fine holes, whereby the ozone microbubbles can be generated while the supplied ozone passes through the bubble layer. As shown in FIG. 3, the spreading unit 120 of the ozone bubbling unit 100 is provided to the outlet of the bubble nozzle 110, and an internal flow passage of a portion of the spreading unit connected to the seawater flow passage has the same diameter as that of the seawater flow passage and an internal flow passage in other regions of the spreading unit distant from the outlet of the bubble nozzle 110 has a larger diameter than the seawater flow passage, whereby the ozone microbubbles can be spread therethrough. In this embodiment, the ozone bubbling unit 100 is illustrated as one example and may be replaced by any bubble nozzle known in the art. As shown in FIG. 3, in this embodiment, the conduit L through which ballast water flows includes a main conduit L1 and a connecting conduit L2 detachably connected between pieces of the main conduit L1, and the ozone bubbling unit 100 may be disposed at a central portion of the connecting conduit L2. In addition, as shown in FIG. 3, both ends of the connecting conduit L2 may have the same diameter as that of the main conduit L1, and the central portion of the connection conduit L2 may have a larger diameter D than the diameter d of both ends thereof. With this structure, the flow rate of the ballast water in the connecting conduit L2 is decreased at the central portion thereof, thereby providing an advantage of promoting spreading of the ozone microbubbles while securing an installation space for the ozone bubbling unit 100 and the pump 310. Further, a flange may be disposed at an interface between the main conduit L1 and the connecting conduit L2 such that the main conduit L1 and the connecting conduit L2 can be coupled to each other by bolts and nuts through the flange. Furthermore, for convenience of installation and coupling of the ozone bubbling unit 100, the ozone supply channel 200 and the seawater pumping unit 300, a portion of an upper side of the connecting conduit L2 may be cut and detachably coupled thereto by bolts and nuts. As shown in FIG. 1, the ozone supply channel 200 acts as a passage through which ozone generated in the ozone generating unit 400 is supplied to the ozone bubbling unit 100, and is detachably coupled at a lower end thereof to the bubble nozzle 110. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 3, in this embodiment, the ozone supply channel 200 may be formed with a separate hole, which is independent of a hole formed in the connecting channel L2 for connection of the pump 310 and the motor 320 to the connecting channel L2, such that the ozone supply channel 200 can be connected to the bubble nozzle 110 through the separate hole. Alternatively, although not shown, the ozone supply channel 200 may be connected to the bubble nozzle 110 through the hole formed in the connecting channel L2 for connection of the pump 310 and the motor 320 to the connecting channel. Further, ozone generated by the ozone generator 430 is supplied to the ozone bubbling unit 100 disposed at the bottom of the ship through the ozone supply channel 200, which passes through a closed space. An ozone transport pipe is likely to suffer from corrosion due to characteristics of ozone. Thus, in this embodiment, in order to prevent leakage of ozone using an ozone transport pipe for redundancy, even upon corrosion of one transport pipe, the ozone supply channel 200, through which ozone is transported, may be realized by a double-pipe, as shown in FIG. 4. The ozone supply channel 200 may be provided with, at least one valve (not, shown), which may be opened or closed by a controller (not shown). Further, the conduit L may be provided therein with at least one bubble sensor (not shown) capable of measuring the amount of bubbles generated, and the controller may regulate the degree of opening of the at least one valve provided to the ozone supply channel 200 and power of the pump 310 based on the amount of the generated bubbles measured by the bubble sensor. The seawater pumping unit 300 supplies the ballast water into the bubble nozzle 110 by pumping the ballast water flowing in the conduit L, and includes: a pump 310 coupled at a left side thereof to the ozone bubbling unit 100 and at a right side thereof to the conduit L to pump the ballast water in the conduit L into the ozone bubbling unit 100; a motor 320 provided to the pump 310 and operating the pump 310; and a bracket 330 provided to the motor 320 and coupling the motor 320 to the conduit L via bolts and nuts, or welding, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 3. As shown in FIG. 2, the ozone generating unit 400 is disposed on the deck D and generates ozone to supply ozone bubbles. The structure in which the ozone generating unit 400 is disposed on the deck D can solve a problem of complicated operation caused by a narrow installation space in the case that such an ozone generating unit is disposed within a ship as in the related art, and allows toxic gas to be diluted in air on the deck D instead of the interior of the ship in case of emergency, thereby providing safety. In this embodiment, the ozone generating unit 400 may be disposed inside a container C, as shown in FIG. 2. This structure allows easy work and provides convenience in installation and movement of the ozone generating unit. As shown in FIG. 2, the ozone generating unit 400 includes an oxygen generator 410 disposed on the deck D and generating oxygen using air supplied thereto, an oxygen storage tank 420 disposed on the deck D and storing oxygen generated by the oxygen generator 410, an ozone generator 430 disposed on the deck D and generating ozone using, oxygen supplied from the oxygen storage tank 420, a water chiller 440 configured to remove heat generated in the course of generating ozone, and a control panel 450 that controls these components 410˜440. The ozone generator 430 may generate ozone in a silent discharge manner wherein, with a dielectric material such as glass or a ceramic material interposed between electrodes, oxygen is supplied into a discharge space and a high voltage of 6 kV˜15 kV is applied to the electrodes to induce reaction for generating ozone in, the discharge space. The ozone gas generated by the ozone generator 430 may be supplied at a flow rate of 1 L/min into the conduit L, through which ballast water flows, such that the conduit L has an ozone concentration of 170 g/cm3 and an ozone injection amount of 2 mg/L. In this embodiment, in order to remove heat generated in the course of generating ozone, the ozone generator 430 may cool the ozone generator 430 using the water chiller 440, as shown in FIG. 1. The water chiller 440 may perform a cooling function using cold fresh water, and the fresh water having high temperature resulting from heat exchange may be cooled again through a cooler. FIG. 5 schematically shows the ship ballast water treatment system according to the embodiment of the present invention in use. Next, operation of the ship ballast water treatment system according to this embodiment will be described with reference to FIG. 5. Ozone generated in the ozone generating unit 400 is supplied to the ozone bubbling unit 100 through the ozone supply channel 200. The ozone bubbling unit 100 converts the supplied ozone into ozone microbubbles using seawater supplied through a seawater supply channel. In addition, the ozone bubbling unit 100 spreads the ozone microbubbles such that the ozone microbubbles can be dissolved in a wide surface area in ballast water. It can be seen that the ozone microbubbles can be more efficiently spread due to decrease in inflow rate of the ballast water resulting from a larger diameter of the central portion of the connecting conduit L2 than that of the main conduit L1. Further, in this embodiment, the pump 310 is directly coupled to the bubbling generating unit such that the ballast water in the conduit L can be directly supplied to the bubble nozzle 110 by the pump 310, thereby simplifying the structure of the ballast water treatment system through elimination of a separate component for bypassing the ballast water. As such, in this embodiment, ozone is converted into bubbles, which in turn are directly supplied into the conduit through which ballast water flows, thereby enabling efficient sterilization of the ballast water, and the ballast water flowing in the conduit can be directly used as a medium for generation of the ozone bubbles, thereby simplifying the structure of the ballast water treatment system.
