Step 4: 5-methylsulfonylisoindoline hydrochloride
A solution of 5-methylsulfonyl-2-tert-butoxycarbonylisoindoline (5.46 g, 18.4 mmol) in methanol/dichloromethane (1:1, 80 mL) was purged with hydrogen chloride gas until saturation, and stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. After the resulting mixture was poured into 800 mL ethyl ether, the precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with ethyl ether and dried to give the product 5-methylsulfonylisoindoline hydrochloride (3.44 g). Yield: 80%.
