FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to organic compounds useful for therapy and/or prophylaxis in a patient, and in particular to inhibitors of TYK2 kinase useful for treating diseases mediated by TYK2 kinase. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION WO2009073153 discloses novel heteroaryl compounds that are linked to an aryl group via an amine linker for the treatment of cancers. WO2011134831 discloses pyrazole compounds as JAK inhibitors for the treatment or prophylaxis of immunological, inflammatory, autoimmune, allergic disorders, and immunologically-mediated diseases. WO2011048082 discloses heterocyclyl pyrazolopyrimidine analogues as JAK inhibitors. WO2011113802 discloses imidazopyridine compounds as inhibitors of TYK2 kinase. Sasaki et al., Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan, vol. 44, no. 3, 1971, pages 858-859, discloses syntheses of fused heterocycles. Cytokine pathways mediate a broad range of biological functions, including many aspects of inflammation and immunity. Janus kinases (JAK), including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 are cytoplasmic protein kinases that associate with type I and type II cytokine receptors and regulate cytokine signal transduction. Cytokine engagement with cognate receptors triggers activation of receptor associated JAKs and this leads to JAK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins and ultimately transcriptional activation of specific gene sets. JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 exhibit broad patterns of gene expression, while JAK3 expression is limited to leukocytes. Cytokine receptors are typically functional as heterodimers, and as a result, more than one type of JAK kinase is usually associated with cytokine receptor complexes. The specific JAKs associated with different cytokine receptor complexes have been determined in many cases through genetic studies and corroborated by other experimental evidence. JAK1 is functionally and physically associated with the type I interferon (e.g., IFNalpha), type II interferon (e.g., IFNgamma), IL-2 and IL-6 cytokine receptor complexes. JAK1 knockout mice die perinatally due to defects in LIF receptor signaling. Characterization of tissues derived from JAK1 knockout mice demonstrated critical roles for this kinase in the IFN, IL-10, IL-2/IL-4, and IL-6 pathways. A humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-6 pathway (Tocilizumab) was recently approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. Biochemical and genetic studies have shown an association between JAK2 and single-chain (e.g., EPO), IL-3 and interferon gamma cytokine receptor families. Consistent with this, JAK2 knockout mice die of anemia. Kinase activating mutations in JAK2 (e.g., JAK2 V617F) are associated with myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) in humans. JAK3 associates exclusively with the gamma common cytokine receptor chain, which is present in the IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 cytokine receptor complexes. JAK3 is critical for lymphoid cell development and proliferation and mutations in JAK3 result in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Based on its role in regulating lymphocytes, JAK3 and JAK3-mediated pathways have been targeted for immunosuppressive indications (e.g., transplantation rejection and rheumatoid arthritis). TYK2 associates with the type I interferon (e.g., IFNalpha), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23 cytokine receptor complexes. Consistent with this, primary cells derived from a TYK2 deficient human are defective in type I interferon, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23 signaling. A fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the shared p40 subunit of the IL-12 and Il-23 cytokines (Ustekinumab) was recently approved by the European Commission for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. In addition, an antibody targeting the IL-12 and IL-23 pathways underwent clinical trials for treating Crohn's Disease.

Example sulfonyloxy groups include, but are not limited to, alkylsulfonyloxy groups (for example methyl sulfonyloxy (mesylate group) and trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy (triflate group)) and arylsulfonyloxy groups (for example p-toluenesulfonyloxy (tosylate group) and p-nitrosulfonyloxy (nosylate group)). "Treat" and "treatment" includes both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or slow down (lessen) an undesired physiological change or disorder, such as the development or spread of cancer. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable, sustaining remission and suppressing reoccurrence. "Treatment" can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder, (for example, through a genetic mutation) or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented. The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" means an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition or disorder, (ii) attenuates, ameliorates or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition or disorder described herein. In the case of cancer, the therapeutically effective amount of the drug may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and alternatively stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and alternatively stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic. For cancer therapy, efficacy can, for example, be measured by assessing the time to disease progression (TTP) and/or determining the response rate (RR). In the case of immunological disorders, the therapeutic effective amount is an amount sufficient to decrease or alleviate an allergic disorder, the symptoms of an autoimmune and/or inflammatory disease, or the symptoms of an acute inflammatory reaction (e.g. asthma). In some embodiments, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount of a chemical entity described herein sufficient to significantly decrease the activity or number of B-cells. The term "NSAID" is an acronym for "non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug" and is a therapeutic agent with analgesic, antipyretic (lowering an elevated body temperature and relieving pain without impairing consciousness) and, in higher doses, with anti-inflammatory effects (reducing inflammation). The term "non-steroidal" is used to distinguish these drugs from steroids, which (among a broad range of other effects) have a similar eicosanoid-depressing, anti-inflammatory action. As analgesics, NSAIDs are unusual in that they are non-narcotic. NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. NSAIDs are usually indicated for the treatment of acute or chronic conditions where pain and inflammation are present. NSAIDs are generally indicated for the symptomatic relief of the following conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory arthropathies (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, acute gout, dysmenorrhoea, metastatic bone pain, headache and migraine, postoperative pain, mild-to-moderate pain due to inflammation and tissue injury, pyrexia, ileus, and renal colic. Most NSAIDs act as non-selective inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, inhibiting both the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes. Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid (itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A2). Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation. COX-2 inhibitors include celecoxib, etoricoxib, lumiracoxib, parecoxib, rofecoxib, rofecoxib, and valdecoxib. The terms "cancer" and "cancerous" refer to or describe the physiological condition in patients that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. A "tumor" comprises one or more cancerous cells. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, blastoma, sarcoma, and leukemia or lymphoid malignancies. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer (e.g., epithelial squamous cell cancer), lung cancer including small- cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer ("NSCLC"), adenocarcinoma of the lung and squamous carcinoma of the lung, cancer of the peritoneum, hepatocellular cancer, gastric or stomach cancer including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial or uterine carcinoma, salivary gland carcinoma, kidney or renal cancer, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, hepatic carcinoma, anal carcinoma, penile carcinoma, as well as head and neck cancer.

In an embodiment an optionally substituted group has 1 substituent. In another embodiment an optionally substituted group has 2 substituents. In another embodiment an optionally substituted group has 3 substituents. The term "prodrug" as used in this application refers to a precursor or derivative form of a pharmaceutically active substance that is less efficacious to the patient or cytotoxic to tumor cells compared to the parent drug and is capable of being enzymatically or hydrolytically activated or converted into the more active parent form. See, e.g., Wilman, "Prodrugs in Cancer Chemotherapy" Biochemical Society Transactions, 14, pp. 375-382, 615th Meeting Belfast (1986) and Stella et al., "Prodrugs: A Chemical Approach to Targeted Drug Delivery," Directed Drug Delivery, Borchardt et al., (ed.), pp. 247-267, Humana Press (1985). The prodrugs of this invention include, but are not limited to, phosphate-containing prodrugs, thiophosphate-containing prodrugs, sulfate-containing prodrugs, peptide-containing prodrugs, D-amino acid-modified prodrugs, glycosylated prodrugs, β-lactam-containing prodrugs, optionally substituted phenoxyacetamide-containing prodrugs or optionally substituted phenylacetamide-containing prodrugs, 5-fluorocytosine and other 5-fluorouridine prodrugs which can be converted into the more active cytotoxic free drug. Examples of cytotoxic drugs that can be derivatized into a prodrug form for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, those chemotherapeutic agents described above. The term "package insert" is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, contraindications and/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products. The term "stereoisomers" refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space. Stereoisomers include diastereomers, enantiomers, conformers and the like. "Diastereomer" refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography. "Enantiomers" refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., "Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds", John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (-) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (-) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms "racemic mixture" and "racemate" refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity. The term "tautomer" or "tautomeric form" refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons. The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable salt," as used herein, refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of Formula I. "Pharmaceutically acceptable salts" include both acid and base addition salts. Exemplary salts include, but are not limited, to sulfate, citrate, acetate, oxalate, chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, lactate, salicylate, acid citrate, tartrate, oleate, tannate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate (i.e., 1,1'-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)) salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion, a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and/or one or more counter ion, for example a dihydrochloride or diformate salt. "Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt" refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free bases and which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, carbonic acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids may be selected from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic, araliphatic, heterocyclic, carboxylic, and sulfonic classes of organic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, gluconic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, maloneic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, aspartic acid, ascorbic acid, glutamic acid, anthranilic acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, embonic acid, phenylacetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicyclic acid and the like. "Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts" include those derived from inorganic bases such as sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum salts and the like. Particularly base addition salts are the ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic nontoxic bases includes salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, ethanolamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, tromethamine, dicyclohexylamine, lysine, arginine, histidine, caffeine, procaine, hydrabamine, choline, betaine, ethylenediamine, glucosamine, methylglucamine, theobromine, purines, piperizine, piperidine, N-ethylpiperidine, polyamine resins and the like.

The compounds of Formula I may contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and, therefore, exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I, including but not limited to: diastereomers, enantiomers, and atropisomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. In addition, the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if a compound of Formula I incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention. Both the single positional isomers and mixture of positional isomers, e.g., resulting from the N-oxidation of the pyrimidinyl and pyrrozolyl rings, or the E and Z forms of compounds of Formula I (for example oxime moieties), are also within the scope of the present invention. In the structures shown herein, where the stereochemistry of any particular chiral atom is not specified, then all stereoisomers are contemplated and included as the compounds of the invention. Where stereochemistry is specified by a solid wedge or dashed line representing a particular configuration, then that stereoisomer is so specified and defined. The compounds of the present invention may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention, as defined by the claims, embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. In an embodiment, compounds of Formula I may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention, as defined by the claims. The term "tautomer" or "tautomeric form" refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example, proton tautomers (also known as prototropic tautomers) include interconversions via migration of a proton, such as keto-enol and imine-enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons. The present invention also embraces isotopically-labeled compounds of Formula I, which are identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. All isotopes of any particular atom or element as specified are contemplated within the scope of the invention. Exemplary isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of Formula I include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, such as 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 15N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 32P, 33P, 35S, 18F, 36Cl, 123I, and 125I, respectively. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of Formula I (e.g., those labeled with 3H and 14C) are useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., 3H) and carbon-14 (i.e., 14C) isotopes are useful for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements). Positron emitting isotopes such as 15O, 13N, 11C, and 18F are useful for positron emission tomography (PET) studies to examine substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of Formula I can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. SYNTHESIS OF TYK2 INHIBITOR COMPOUNDS Compounds of Formula I may be synthesized by synthetic routes described herein. In certain embodiments, processes well-known in the chemical arts can be used, in addition to, or in light of, the description contained herein. The starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, Wis.) or are readily prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art (e.g., prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser, Reagents for Organic Synthesis, v. 1-19, Wiley, N.Y. (1967-1999 ed.), Beilsteins Handbuch der organischen Chemie, 4, Aufl. ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, including supplements (also available via the Beilstein online database)), or Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry, Editors Katrizhy and Rees, Pergamon Press, 1984. Compounds of Formula I may be prepared singly or as compound libraries comprising at least 2, for example 5 to 1,000 compounds, or 10 to 100 compounds of Formula I. Libraries of compounds of Formula I may be prepared by a combinatorial 'split and mix' approach or by multiple parallel syntheses using either solution phase or solid phase chemistry, by procedures known to those skilled in the art. Thus according to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound library comprising at least 2 compounds of Formula I, enantiomers, diasteriomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In the preparation of compounds of the present invention, protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary or secondary amine) of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups (NH-Pg) include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz) and 9-fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1991. Compounds of the invention may be prepared from commercially available starting materials using the general methods illustrated herein. For illustrative purposes, reaction Schemes 1-4 depicted below provide routes for synthesizing the compounds of Formula I, as well as key intermediates. For a more detailed description of the individual reaction steps, see the Examples section below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be available and used. Although specific starting materials and reagents are depicted in the Schemes and discussed below, other starting materials and reagents may be available for substitution to provide a variety of derivatives and/or reaction conditions. In addition, many of the compounds prepared by the methods described below can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art. (Method 1) shows the preparation of compounds of formulas 5 and 6, wherein R1, R2, A, R5 are as defined in Formula I. Commercially available 2-chloro-3-formyl-4-iodopyridine was treated with hydrazine in ethanol at 23 °C to give pyrazole 2. Upon heating of pyrazole 2 with an aryl fluoride in the presence of K2CO3, both 3 and its regio-isomer 4 were produced. This mixture could be separated via column chromatography on silica gel. Intermediate 3 could be coupled to an amine or amide under Pd-catalyzed conditions to provide products such as 5 or 6. An alternative procedure is shown in Scheme 2 (Method 2), wherein X, A, R1, R2 and R5 are as defined for Formula I. Synthesis started with commercially available 4-chloropyridine 7, which was deprotonated with LDA, followed by quenching with DMF to provide aldehyde 8. 4-chloropyridine-3-carboxaldehyde 8 was treated with sodium azide to displace 4-chloride to give 9. When azide 9 was condensed with an aniline in the presence of TiCl4, the resulting imine intermediate was not isolated, but was directly heated in toluene to effect ring closure that yielded 10. This was followed by N-oxide formation with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of catalytic amount of methyl rhenium trioxide. Subsequently, the N-oxide was treated with POCl3 or POBr3 to give chloride or bromide 11. Under Pd-catalyzed conditions, 11 could then be coupled to an amine or amide to provide products 5 or 6. For some substrates, the amine could be coupled with intermediate 11 through a SNAr-type reaction in the presence of a base, such as sodium hydride, as outlined in Scheme 3 (Method 3). Final products 5 or 6 could also be prepared according to Scheme 4 (Method 4). Intermediate 11 from Scheme 2 could be coupled with tert-butyl carbamate via Pd-catalyzed reaction, followed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid to provide amino intermediate 13. Intermediate 13 could then be transformed to 5 via a Pd-catalyzed coupling reaction with an aryl- or heteroaryl-chloride or bromide. The amino intermediate 13 could also be coupled to an acid chloride to give amide 6. It will be appreciated that where appropriate functional groups exist, compounds of various formulae or any intermediates used in their preparation may be further derivatised by one or more standard synthetic methods employing condensation, substitution, oxidation, reduction, or cleavage reactions. Particular substitution approaches include conventional alkylation, arylation, heteroarylation, acylation, sulfonylation, halogenation, nitration, formylation and coupling procedures. In each of the exemplary Schemes it may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and/or from starting materials. Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereoisomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereoisomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of the present invention may be atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column. A single stereoisomer, e.g. an enantiomer, substantially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994; Lochmuller, C. H., J. Chromatogr., 113(3):283-302 (1975)). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separation of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure stereoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See: Drug Stereochemistry, Analytical Methods and Pharmacology, Irving W. Wainer, Ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York (1993). Diastereomeric salts can be formed by reaction of enantiomerically pure chiral bases such as brucine, quinine, ephedrine, strychnine, α-methyl-β-phenylethylamine (amphetamine), and the like with asymmetric compounds bearing acidic functionality, such as carboxylic acid and sulfonic acid. The diastereomeric salts may be induced to separate by fractional crystallization or ionic chromatography. For separation of the optical isomers of amino compounds, addition of chiral carboxylic or sulfonic acids, such as camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, mandelic acid, or lactic acid can result in formation of the diastereomeric salts. Alternatively, the substrate to be resolved is reacted with one enantiomer of a chiral compound to form a diastereomeric pair (Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1994, p. 322). Diastereomeric compounds can be formed by reacting asymmetric compounds with enantiomerically pure chiral derivatizing reagents, such as menthyl derivatives, followed by separation of the diastereomers and hydrolysis to yield the pure or enriched enantiomer. A method of determining optical purity involves making chiral esters, such as a menthyl ester, e.g. (-) menthyl chloroformate in the presence of base, or Mosher ester, α-methoxy-α-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl acetate (Jacob, J. Org. Chem. 47:4165 (1982)), of the racemic mixture, and analyzing the NMR spectrum for the presence of the two atropisomeric enantiomers or diastereomers. Stable diastereomers of atropisomeric compounds can be separated and isolated by normal- and reverse-phase chromatography following methods for separation of atropisomeric naphthyl-isoquinolines (WO 96/15111). By method (3), a racemic mixture of two enantiomers can be separated by chromatography using a chiral stationary phase (Chiral Liquid Chromatography W. J. Lough, Ed., Chapman and Hall, New York, (1989); Okamoto, J. of Chromatogr. 513:375-378 (1990)). Enriched or purified enantiomers can be distinguished by methods used to distinguish other chiral molecules with asymmetric carbon atoms, such as optical rotation and circular dichroism. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND ADMINISTRATION Another embodiment provides pharmaceutical compositions or medicaments containing the compounds of the invention and a therapeutically inert carrier, diluent or excipient, as well as methods of using the compounds of the invention to prepare such compositions and medicaments. In one example, compounds of Formula I may be formulated by mixing at ambient temperature at the appropriate pH, and at the desired degree of purity, with physiologically acceptable carriers, i.e., carriers that are non-toxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed into a galenical administration form. The pH of the formulation depends on the particular use and the concentration of compound, and can range anywhere from about 3 to about 8. In one example, a compound of Formula I is formulated in an acetate buffer, at pH 5. In another embodiment, the compounds of Formula I are sterile. The compound may be stored, for example, as a solid or amorphous composition, as a lyophilized formulation or as an aqueous solution. Compositions are formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular patient being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The "effective amount" of the compound to be administered will be governed by such considerations, and is the minimum amount necessary to inhibit TYK2 kinase activity. For example, such amount may be below the amount that is toxic to normal cells, or the patient as a whole. The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well-known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate warnings. Sustained-release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained-release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing a compound of Formula I, which matrices are in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, or microcapsules. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides, copolymers of L-glutamic acid and gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate, nondegradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. In one example, the pharmaceutically effective amount of the compound of the invention administered parenterally per dose will be in the range of about 0.01-100 mg/kg, alternatively about 0.1 to 20 mg/kg of patient body weight per day, with the typical initial range of compound used being 0.3 to 15 mg/kg/day. In another embodiment, oral unit dosage forms, such as tablets and capsules, contain from about 5-100 mg of the compound of the invention. The compounds of the invention may be administered by any suitable means, including oral, topical (including buccal and sublingual), rectal, vaginal, transdermal, parenteral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, intradermal, intrathecal, inhaled and epidural and intranasal, and, if desired for local treatment, intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. The compounds of the present invention may be administered in any convenient administrative form, e.g., tablets, powders, capsules, solutions, dispersions, suspensions, syrups, sprays, suppositories, gels, emulsions, patches, aerosols, etc. Such compositions may contain components conventional in pharmaceutical preparations, e.g., diluents, carriers, pH modifiers, sweeteners, bulking agents, and further active agents. A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier or excipient. Suitable carriers and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and are described in detail in, e.g., Ansel, Howard C., et al., Ansel's Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2004; Gennaro, Alfonso R., et al. Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 2000; and Rowe, Raymond C. Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients. Chicago, Pharmaceutical Press, 2005. The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents, diluents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament). An example of a suitable oral dosage form is a tablet containing about 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg or 500 mg of the compound of the invention compounded with about 90-30 mg anhydrous lactose, about 5-40 mg sodium croscarmellose, about 5-30 mg polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) K30, and about 1-10 mg magnesium stearate. The powdered ingredients are first mixed together and then mixed with a solution of the PVP. The resulting composition can be dried, granulated, mixed with the magnesium stearate and compressed to tablet form using conventional equipment. An example of an aerosol formulation can be prepared by dissolving the compound, for example 5-400 mg, of the invention in a suitable buffer solution, e.g. a phosphate buffer, adding a tonicifier, e.g. a salt such sodium chloride, if desired. The solution may be filtered, e.g., using a 0.2 micron filter, to remove impurities and contaminants. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition also includes an additional chemotherapeutic agent selected from an anti-proliferative agent, an anti-inflammatory agent, an immunomodulatory agent, a neurotropic factor, an agent for treating cardiovascular disease, an agent for treating liver disease, an antiviral agent, an agent for treating blood disorders, an agent for treating diabetes, or an agent for treating immunodeficiency disorders.

Another embodiment includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in the treatment of psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease. INDICATIONS AND METHODS OF TREATMENT The compounds of the invention inhibit TYK2 kinase activity. Accordingly, the compounds of the invention are useful for reducing inflammation in particular patient tissue and cells. Compounds of the invention are useful for inhibiting TYK2 kinase activity in cells that overexpress TYK2 kinase. Alternatively, compounds of the invention are useful for inhibiting TYK2 kinase activity in cells in which, for example, the type I interferon, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-23 signaling pathway is disruptive or abnormal, for example by binding to TYK2 kinase and inhibiting its activity.

Evaluation of drug-induced immunosuppression by the compounds of the invention may be performed using in vivo functional tests, such as rodent models of induced arthritis and therapeutic or prophylactic treatment to assess disease score, T cell-dependent antibody response (TDAR), and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). Other in vivo systems including murine models of host defense against infections or tumor resistance (Burleson GR, Dean JH, and Munson AE. Methods in Immunotoxicology, Vol. 1. Wiley-Liss, New York, 1995) may be considered to elucidate the nature or mechanisms of observed immunosuppression. The in vivo test systems can be complemented by well-established in vitro or ex vivo functional assays for the assessment of immune competence. These assays may comprise B or T cell proliferation in response to mitogens or specific antigens, measurement of signaling through one or more of the Janus kinase pathways in B or T cells or immortalized B or T cell lines, measurement of cell surface markers in response to B or T cell signaling, natural killer (NK) cell activity, mast cell activity, mast cell degranulation, macrophage phagocytosis or kill activity, and neutrophil oxidative burst and/or chemotaxis. In each of these tests determination of cytokine production by particular effector cells (e.g., lymphocytes, NK, monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils) may be included. The in vitro and ex vivo assays can be applied in both preclinical and clinical testing using lymphoid tissues and/or peripheral blood (House RV. "Theory and practice of cytokine assessment in immunotoxicology" (1999) Methods 19:17-27; Hubbard AK. "Effects of xenobiotics on macrophage function: evaluation in vitro" (1999) Methods;19:8-16; Lebrec H, et al (2001) Toxicology 158:25-29). Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) is an animal model of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Joint inflammation, which develops in animals with CIA, strongly resembles inflammation observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Blocking tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an efficacious treatment of CIA, just as it is a highly efficacious therapy in treatment of RA patients. CIA is mediated by both T-cells and antibodies (B-cells). Macrophages are believed to play an important role in mediating tissue damage during disease development. CIA is induced by immunizing animals with collagen emulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA). It is most commonly induced in the DBA/1 mouse strain, but the disease can also be induced in Lewis rats. The T-cell Dependent Antibody Response (TDAR) is An assay for immune function testing when potential immunotoxic effects of compounds need to be studied. The IgM-Plaque Forming Cell (PFC) assay, using Sheep Red Blood Cells (SRBC) as the antigen, is currently a widely accepted and validated standard test. TDAR is an assay for adult exposure immunotoxicity detection in mice based on the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) database (M.I. Luster et al (1992) Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 18:200-210). The utility of this assay stems from the fact that it is a holistic measurement involving several important components of an immune response. A TDAR is dependent on functions of the following cellular compartments: (1) antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages or dendritic cells; (2) T-helper cells, which are critical players in the genesis of the response, as well as in isotype switching; and (3) B-cells, which are the ultimate effector cells and are responsible for antibody production. Chemically-induced changes in any one compartment can cause significant changes in the overall TDAR (M.P. Holsapple In: G.R. Burleson, J.H. Dean and A.E. Munson, Editors, Modern Methods in Immunotoxicology, Volume 1, Wiley-Liss Publishers, New York, NY (1995), pp. 71-108). Usually, this assay is performed either as an ELISA for measurement of soluble antibody (R.J. Smialowizc et al (2001) Toxicol. Sci. 61:164-175) or as a plaque (or antibody) forming cell assay (L. Guo et al (2002) Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 181:219-227) to detect plasma cells secreting antigen specific antibodies. The antigen of choice is either whole cells (e.g. sheep erythrocytes) or soluble protein antigens (T. Miller et al (1998) Toxicol. Sci. 42:129-135). A compound of Formula I may be administered by any route appropriate to the disease or condition to be treated. Suitable routes include oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), transdermal, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal, intraperitoneal, intrapulmonary, and intranasal. For local immunosuppressive treatment, the compounds may be administered by intralesional administration, including perfusing or otherwise contacting the graft with the inhibitor before transplantation. It will be appreciated that the route may vary with for example the condition of the recipient. Where the compound of Formula I is administered orally, it may be formulated as a pill, capsule, tablet, etc. with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Where the compound of Formula I is administered parenterally, it may be formulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable parenteral vehicle and in a unit dosage injectable form, as detailed below. A dose to treat human patients may range from about 5 mg to about 1000 mg of a compound of Formula I. A typical dose may be about 5 mg to about 300 mg of a compound of Formula I. A dose may be administered once a day (QD), twice per day (BID), or more frequently, depending on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the particular compound. In addition, toxicity factors may influence the dosage and administration regimen. When administered orally, the pill, capsule, or tablet may be ingested daily or less frequently for a specified period of time. The regimen may be repeated for a number of cycles of therapy. COMBINATION THERAPY The compounds of Formula I may be employed alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of a disease or disorder described herein, such as an immunologic disorder (e.g. psoriasis or inflammation) or a hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). In certain embodiments, a compound of Formula I is combined in a pharmaceutical combination formulation, or dosing regimen as combination therapy, with a second therapeutic compound that has anti-inflammatory or anti-hyperproliferative properties or that is useful for treating an inflammation, immune-response disorder, or hyperproliferative disorder (e.g., cancer). The second therapeutic agent may be a NSAID or other anti-inflammatory agent. The second therapeutic agent may be a chemotherapeutic agent. The second therapeutic agent of the pharmaceutical combination formulation or dosing regimen for example has complementary activities to the compound of Formula I such that they do not adversely affect each other. Such compounds are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended. In one embodiment, a composition of this invention comprises a compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, metabolite, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a therapeutic agent such as an NSAID. The application discloses a method of treating or lessening the severity of a disease or condition responsive to the inhibition of TYK2 kinase in a patient, comprising administering to said patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I, and further comprising, administering a second therapeutic agent. The combination therapy may be administered as a simultaneous or sequential regimen. When administered sequentially, the combination may be administered in two or more administrations. The combined administration includes coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein for example there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities. Suitable dosages for any of the above coadministered agents are those presently used and may be lowered due to the combined action (synergy) of the newly identified agent and other chemotherapeutic agents or treatments. In a particular embodiment of therapy, a compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may be combined with other therapeutic, hormonal or antibody agents such as those described herein, as well as combined with surgical therapy and radiotherapy. Combination therapies according to the present invention thus comprise the administration of at least one compound of Formula I, or a stereoisomer, geometric isomer, tautomer, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and the use of at least one other cancer treatment method, or immunological disorder method. The amounts of the compound(s) of Formula I and the other pharmaceutically active immunologic or chemotherapeutic agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.

BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES Compounds of Formula I may be assayed for the ability to modulate the activity of protein kinases, tyrosine kinases, additional serine/threonine kinases, and/or dual specificity kinases in vitro and in vivo. In vitro assays include biochemical and cell-based assays that determine inhibition of the kinase activity. Alternate in vitro assays quantify the ability of the compound of Formula I to bind to kinases and may be measured either by radiolabelling the compound of Formula I prior to binding, isolating the compound of Formula I /kinase complex and determining the amount of radiolabel bound, or by running a competition experiment where a compound of Formula I is incubated with known radiolabeled ligands. These and other useful in vitro assays are well known to those of skill in the art. In an embodiment, the compounds of Formula I can be used to control, modulate or inhibit tyrosine kinase activity, for example TYK2 kinase activity, additional serine/threonine kinases, and/or dual specificity kinases. Thus, they are useful as pharmacological standards for use in the development of new biological tests, assays and in the search for new pharmacological agents. EXAMPLE A JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 Inhibition Assay Protocol The activity of the isolated JAK1, JAK2 or TYK2 kinase domain was measured by monitoring phosphorylation of a peptide derived from JAK3 (Val-Ala-Leu-Val-Asp-Gly-Tyr-Phe-Arg-Leu-Thr-Thr) fluorescently labeled on the N-terminus with 5-carboxyfluorescein using the Caliper LabChip technology (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA). To determine the inhibition constants (Ki) of Examples 1-165, compounds were diluted serially in DMSO and added to 50 µL kinase reactions containing 1.5 nM JAK1, 0.2 nM purified JAK2 or 1 nM purified TYK2 enzyme, 100 mM Hepes pH7.2, 0.015% Brij-35, 1.5 uM peptide substrate, 25 uM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 4 mM DTT at a final DMSO concentration of 2%. Reactions were incubated at 22 °C in 384-well polypropylene microtiter plates for 30 minutes and then stopped by addition of 25 µL of an EDTA containing solution (100 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 0.015% Brij-35, 150 mM EDTA), resulting in a final EDTA concentration of 50 mM. After termination of the kinase reaction, the proportion of phosphorylated product was determined as a fraction of total peptide substrate using the Caliper LabChip 3000 according to the manufacturer's specifications. Ki values were then determined using the Morrison tight binding model. Morrison, J.F., Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 185:269-296 (1969); William, J.W. and Morrison, J.F., Meth. Enzymol., 63:437-467 (1979). EXAMPLE B JAK3 Inhibition Assay Protocol The activity of the isolated JAK3 kinase domain was measured by monitoring phosphorylation of a peptide derived from JAK3 (Leu-Pro-Leu-Asp-Lys-Asp-Tyr-Tyr-Val-Val-Arg) fluorescently labeled on the N-terminus with 5-carboxyfluorescein using the Caliper LabChip technology (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA).

EXAMPLE C Cell-based Pharmacology Assays The activities of compounds 1-89 were determined in cell-based assays that are designed to measure Janus kinase dependent signaling.
