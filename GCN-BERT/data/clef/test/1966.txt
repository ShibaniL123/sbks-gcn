FIELD The discovery is in the field of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) breeding, specifically relating to the sorghum line designated PHOIOMQKT. BACKGROUND The goal of plant breeding is to combine in a single variety various desirable traits. For field crops, these traits may include higher seed yield, higher biomass yield, higher sugar yield, improved composition traits, improved conversion traits, resistance to diseases and insects, better stems and roots, tolerance to heat, tolerance to low temperatures, tolerance to drought and salt, reducing the time to crop maturity, greater yield and yield stability, presence or absence of dwarfing genes, improved nutrient value, increased growth rate, and better agronomic characteristics or grain quality. With mechanical harvesting of many crops, uniformity of plant characteristics such as germination and stand establishment, growth rate, maturity, plant height and fruit size, is important. Grain sorghum is an important and valuable food and feed grain crop. In addition, its vegetative parts are used for forage, syrup and shelter. Thus, a continuing goal of plant breeders is to develop stable high yielding sorghum hybrids that are agronomically sound. The reasons for this goal are to maximize the amount of grain produced on the land used and to supply food for both animals and humans. Sorghum is in the same family as maize and has a similar growth habit, but with more tillers and a more extensively branched root system. Sorghum is more drought resistant and heat-tolerant than maize. It requires an average temperature of at least 25° C. to produce maximum yields. Sorghum's ability to thrive with less water than maize may be due to its ability to hold water in its foliage better than maize. Sorghum has a waxy coating on its leaves and stems which helps to keep water in the plant even in intense heat. Wild species of sorghum tend to grow to a height of 1.5 to 2 meters; however in order to improve harvestability, dwarfing genes have been selected in cultivated varieties and hybrids such that most cultivated varieties and hybrids grow to between 60 and 120 cm tall. SUMMARY According to the present invention, there is provided a novel sorghum line designated PHOIOMQKT. This invention relates to seed of sorghum line PHOIOMQKT, to the plants of sorghum line PHOIOMQKT, to plant parts of sorghum line PHOIOMQKT, and to processes for making a plant that comprise crossing sorghum line PHOIOMQKT with another plant. This invention also relates to processes for making a plant containing in its genetic material one or more traits introgressed into PHOIOMQKT through backcross conversion and/or transformation, and to the seed, plant and plant arts produced thereby. This invention further relates is to a hybrid seed, plant, or plant part produced by crossing the line PHOIOMQKT or a locus conversion of PHOIOMQKT with another plant.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Field crops are bred through techniques that take advantage of the plant's method of pollination. A plant is self-pollinating if pollen from one flower is transferred to the same or another flower of the same plant. A plant is cross-pollinated if the pollen comes from a flower on a different plant. Plants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type for many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true breeding progeny. A cross between two homozygous plants from differing backgrounds or two homozygous lines produce a uniform population of hybrid plants that may be heterozygous for many gene loci. A cross of two plants that are each heterozygous at a number of gene loci will produce a population of hybrid plants that differ genetically and will not be uniform. Sorghum plants (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) are bred in most cases by self pollination techniques. With the incorporation of male sterility (either genetic or cytoplasmic) cross pollination breeding techniques can also be utilized. Sorghum has a perfect flower with both male and female parts in the same flower located in the panicle. The flowers are usually in pairs on the panicle branches. Natural pollination occurs in sorghum when anthers (male flowers) open and pollen falls onto receptive stigma (female flowers). Because of the close proximity of male (anthers) and female (stigma) in the panicle, self pollination is very high (average 94%). Cross pollination may occur when wind or convection currents move pollen from the anthers of one plant to receptive stigma on another plant. Cross pollination is greatly enhanced with incorporation of male sterility which renders male flowers nonviable without affecting the female flowers. Successful pollination in the case of male sterile flowers requires cross pollination. Inbred Development The development of sorghum hybrids requires the development of homozygous inbred lines, the crossing of these lines, and the evaluation of the crosses. Pedigree breeding methods, and to a lesser extent population breeding methods, are used to develop inbred lines from breeding populations. Breeding programs combine desirable traits from two or more inbred lines into breeding pools from which new inbred lines are developed by selfing and selection of desired phenotypes. The new inbreds are crossed with other inbred lines and the hybrids from these crosses are evaluated to determine which have commercial potential. Pedigree breeding starts with the crossing of two genotypes, each of which may have one or more desirable characteristics that is lacking in the other or which complement the other. If the two original parents do not provide all of the desired characteristics, other sources can be included in the breeding population. In the pedigree method, superior plants are selfed and selected in successive generations. In the succeeding generations the heterozygous condition gives way to homogeneous lines as a result of self-pollination and selection. Typically, in the pedigree method of breeding five or more generations of selfing and selection is practiced. F1 to F2; F2 to F3; F3 to F4, F4 to F5, etc. Backcrossing can be used to improve an inbred line. Backcrossing transfers a specific desirable trait from one inbred or source to an inbred that lacks that trait. This can be accomplished for example by first crossing a superior inbred (A) (recurrent parent) to a donor inbred (non-recurrent parent), which carries the appropriate genes(s) for the trait in question. The progeny of this cross is then mated back to the superior recurrent parent (A) followed by selection in the resultant progeny for the desired trait to be transferred from the non-recurrent parent. After five or more backcross generations with selection for the desired trait, the progeny will be heterozygous for loci controlling the characteristic being transferred, but will be like the superior parent for most or almost all other genes. The last backcross generation would be selfed to give pure breeding progeny for the gene(s) being transferred. Controlling Self-Pollination Sorghum varieties are mainly self-pollinated; therefore, self-pollination of the parental varieties must be controlled to make hybrid development feasible. A pollination control system and effective transfer of pollen from one parent to the other offers improved plant breeding and an effective method for producing hybrid seed and plants. For example, the milo or A1 cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) system, developed via a cross between milo and kafir cultivars, is one of the most frequently used CMS systems in hybrid sorghum production (Stephens J C & Holland P F, Cytoplasmic Male Sterility for Hybrid Sorghum Seed Production, Agron. J. 46:20-23 (1954)). Other CMS systems for sorghum include, but are not limited to, A2, isolated from IS 12662c (Schertz K F, Registration of A2T, 2753 and BT, 2753 Sorghum Germplasm, Crop Sci. 17: 983 (1977)), A3, isolated from IS 1112c or converted Nilwa (Quinby J R, Interactions of Genes and Cytoplasms in Male-Sterility in Sorghums, Proc. 35th Corn Sorghum Res. Conf. Am. Seed Trade Assoc. Chicago, Ill., pp. 5-8 (1980)), A4, isolated from IS 7920c (Worstell et al, Relationship among Male-Sterility Inducing Cytoplasms of Sorghum, Crop Sci. 24:186-189 (1984)). In developing improved new sorghum hybrid varieties, breeders may use a CMS plant as the female parent. In using these plants, breeders attempt to improve the efficiency of seed production and the quality of the F1 hybrids and to reduce the breeding costs. When hybridization is conducted without using CMS plants, it is more difficult to obtain and isolate the desired traits in the progeny (F1 generation) because the parents are capable of undergoing both cross-pollination and self-pollination. If one of the parents is a CMS plant that is incapable of producing pollen, only cross pollination will occur. By eliminating the pollen of one parental variety in a cross, a plant breeder is assured of obtaining hybrid seed of uniform quality, provided that the parents are of uniform quality and the breeder conducts a single cross. In one instance, production of F1 hybrids includes crossing a CMS female parent with a pollen-producing male parent. To reproduce effectively, however, the male parent of the F1 hybrid must have a fertility restorer gene (Rf gene). The presence of an Rf gene means that the F1 generation will not be completely or partially sterile, so that either self-pollination or cross pollination may occur. Self pollination of the F1 generation to produce several subsequent generations is important to ensure that a desired trait is heritable and stable and that a new variety has been isolated. Promising advanced breeding lines commonly are tested and compared to appropriate standards in environments representative of the commercial target area(s). The best lines are candidates for new commercial lines; and those still deficient in a few traits may be used as parents to produce new populations for further selection. Hybrid Development A hybrid sorghum variety is the cross of two inbred lines, each of which may have one or more desirable characteristics lacked by the other or which complement the other. The hybrid progeny of the first generation is designated F1. In the development of hybrids only the F1 hybrid plants are sought. The F1 hybrid is more vigorous than its inbred parents. This hybrid vigor, or heterosis, can be manifested in many ways, including increased vegetative growth and increased yield. The development of a hybrid sorghum variety involves five steps: (1) the formation of “restorer” and “non-restorer” germplasm pools; (2) the selection of superior plants from various “restorer” and “non-restorer” germplasm pools; (3) the selfing of the superior plants for several generations to produce a series of inbred lines, which although different from each other, each breed true and are highly uniform; (4) the conversion of inbred lines classified as non-restorers to cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) forms, and (5) crossing the selected cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) inbred lines with selected fertile inbred lines (restorer lines) to produce the hybrid progeny (F1). Because sorghum is normally a self pollinated plant and because both male and female flowers are in the same panicle, large numbers of hybrid seed can only be produced by using cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) inbreds. Flowers of the CMS inbred are fertilized with pollen from a male fertile inbred carrying genes which restore male fertility in the hybrid (F1) plants. An important consequence of the homozygosity and homogeneity of the inbred lines is that the hybrid between any two inbreds will always be the same. Once the inbreds that produce the best hybrid have been identified, the hybrid seed can be reproduced indefinitely as long as the homogeneity of the inbred parent is maintained. A single cross hybrid is produced when two inbred lines are crossed to produce the F1 progeny. Much of the hybrid vigor exhibited by F1 hybrids is lost in the next generation (F2). Consequently, seed from hybrid varieties is not used for planting stock. Hybrid grain sorghum can be produced using wind to move the pollen. Alternating strips of the cytoplasmic male sterile inbred (female) and the male fertile inbred (male) are planted in the same field. Wind moves the pollen shed by the male inbred to receptive stigma on the female. Providing that there is sufficient isolation from sources of foreign sorghum pollen, the stigma of the male sterile inbred (female) will be fertilized only with pollen from the male fertile inbred (male). The resulting seed, born on the male sterile (female) plants is therefore hybrid and will form hybrid plants that have full fertility restored. Locus Conversions of Sorghum Line PHOIOMQKT PHOIOMQKT represents a new base genetic line into which a new locus or trait may be introduced. Direct transformation and backcrossing represent two important methods that can be used to accomplish such an introgression. The term locus conversion is used to designate the product of such an introgression. To select and develop a superior hybrid, it is necessary to identify and select genetically unique individuals that occur in a segregating population. The segregating population is the result of a combination of crossover events plus the independent assortment of specific combinations of alleles at many gene loci that results in specific and unique genotypes. Once such a variety is developed its value to society is substantial since it is important to advance the germplasm base as a whole in order to maintain or improve traits such as yield, disease resistance, pest resistance and plant performance in extreme weather conditions. Locus conversions are routinely used to add or modify one or a few traits of such a line and this further enhances its value and usefulness to society. Backcrossing can be used to improve inbred varieties and a hybrid variety which is made using those inbreds. Backcrossing can be used to transfer a specific desirable trait from one variety, the donor parent, to an inbred called the recurrent parent which has overall good agronomic characteristics yet that lacks the desirable trait. This transfer of the desirable trait into an inbred with overall good agronomic characteristics can be accomplished by first crossing a recurrent parent to a donor parent (non-recurrent parent). The progeny of this cross is then mated back to the recurrent parent followed by selection in the resultant progeny for the desired trait to be transferred from the non-recurrent parent. Traits may be used by those of ordinary skill in the art to characterize progeny. Traits are commonly evaluated at a significance level, such as a 1%, 5% or 10% significance level, when measured in plants grown in the same environmental conditions. For example, a locus conversion of PHOIOMQKT may be characterized as having essentially the same phenotypic traits as PHOIOMQKT. The traits used for comparison may be those traits shown in Table 1. Molecular markers can also be used during the breeding process for the selection of qualitative traits. For example, markers can be used to select plants that contain the alleles of interest during a backcrossing breeding program. The markers can also be used to select for the genome of the recurrent parent and against the genome of the donor parent. Using this procedure can minimize the amount of genome from the donor parent that remains in the selected plants. A locus conversion of PHOIOMQKT will retain the genetic integrity of PHOIOMQKT. A locus conversion of PHOIOMQKT will comprise at least 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the base genetics of PHOIOMQKT. For example, a locus conversion of PHOIOMQKT can be developed when DNA sequences are introduced through backcrossing (Hallauer et al., 1988), with a parent of PHOIOMQKT utilized as the recurrent parent. Both naturally occurring and transgenic DNA sequences may be introduced through backcrossing techniques. A backcross conversion may produce a plant with a locus conversion in at least one or more backcrosses, including at least 2 crosses, at least 3 crosses, at least 4 crosses, at least 5 crosses and the like. Molecular marker assisted breeding or selection may be utilized to reduce the number of backcrosses necessary to achieve the backcross conversion. For example, see Openshaw, S. J. et al., Marker-assisted Selection in Backcross Breeding. In: Proceedings Symposium of the Analysis of Molecular Data, August 1994, Crop Science Society of America, Corvallis, Oreg., where it is demonstrated that a backcross conversion can be made in as few as two backcrosses. A locus conversion of PHOIOMQKT can be determined through the use of a molecular profile. A locus conversion of PHOIOMQKT would have 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the molecular markers, or molecular profile, of PHOIOMQKT. Examples of molecular markers that could be used to determine the molecular profile include Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLP), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis, and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR), and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Transformation of Sorghum Line PHOIOMQKT The advent of new molecular biological techniques has allowed the isolation and characterization of genetic elements with specific functions, such as encoding specific protein products. Scientists in the field of plant biology developed a strong interest in engineering the genome of plants to contain and express foreign genetic elements, or additional, or modified versions of native or endogenous genetic elements in order to alter the traits of a plant in a specific manner. Any DNA sequences, whether from a different species or from the same species, that are inserted into the genome using transformation are referred to herein collectively as “transgenes.” Numerous methods for plant transformation have been developed, including biological and physical plant transformation protocols. See, for example, Miki, et al., “Procedures for Introducing Foreign DNA into Plants” in Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Glick. In addition, expression vectors and in vitro culture methods for plant cell or tissue transformation and regeneration of plants are available. See, for example, Gruber, et al., “Vectors for Plant Transformation” in Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Glick and Thompson, Eds. (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, 1993) pages 89-119. The most prevalent types of plant transformation involve the construction of an expression vector. Such a vector comprises a DNA sequence that contains a gene under the control of or operatively linked to a regulatory element, for example a promoter. The vector may contain one or more genes and one or more regulatory elements. A genetic trait which has been engineered into a particular sorghum plant using transformation techniques, could be moved into another line using traditional breeding techniques that are well known in the plant breeding arts. For example, a backcrossing approach could be used to move a transgene from a transformed sorghum plant to an elite inbred line and the resulting progeny would comprise a transgene. Also, if an inbred line was used for the transformation then the transgenic plants could be crossed to a different line in order to produce a transgenic hybrid sorghum plant. As used herein, “crossing” can refer to a simple X by Y cross, or the process of backcrossing, depending on the context. Various genetic elements can be introduced into the plant genome using transformation. These elements include but are not limited to genes; coding sequences; inducible, constitutive, and tissue specific promoters; enhancing sequences; and signal and targeting sequences. For example, see, U.S. Pat. No. 6,118,055. With transgenic plants according to the present discovery, a foreign protein can be produced in commercial quantities. Thus, techniques for the selection and propagation of transformed plants, which are well understood in the art, yield a plurality of transgenic plants which are harvested in a conventional manner, and a foreign protein then can be extracted from a tissue of interest or from total biomass. Protein extraction from plant biomass can be accomplished by known methods which are discussed, for example, by Heney and Orr, (1981) Anal. Biochem. 114:92-96. A genetic map can be generated, primarily via conventional Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLP), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis, and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR), and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), which identifies the approximate chromosomal location of the integrated DNA molecule coding for the foreign protein. For exemplary methodologies in this regard, see, Glick and Thompson, METHODS IN PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY 269-284 (CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1993). Map information concerning chromosomal location is useful for proprietary protection of a subject transgenic plant. If unauthorized propagation is undertaken and crosses made with other germplasm, the map of the integration region can be compared to similar maps for suspect plants, to determine if the latter have a common parentage with the subject plant. Map comparisons would involve hybridizations, RFLP, PCR, SSR, SNP, and sequencing, all of which are conventional techniques. Likewise, by means of the present discovery, plants can be genetically engineered to express various phenotypes of agronomic interest. Exemplary transgenes implicated in this regard include, but are not limited to, those categorized below. 1. Genes that create a site for site specific DNA integration. This includes the introduction of FRT sites that may be used in the FLP/FRT system and/or Lox sites that may be used in the Cre/Loxp system. For example, see, Lyznik, et al., (2003) “Site-Specific Recombination for Genetic Engineering in Plants”, Plant Cell Rep 21:925-932 and WO 99/25821, which are hereby incorporated by reference. Other systems that may be used include the Gin recombinase of phage Mu (Maeser, et al., 1991), the Pin recombinase of E. coli (Enomoto, et al., 1983), and the R/RS system of the pSR1 plasmid (Araki, et al., 1992). 2. Genes that affect abiotic stress resistance (including but not limited to flowering, panicle/glume and seed development, enhancement of nitrogen utilization efficiency, altered nitrogen responsiveness, drought resistance or tolerance, cold resistance or tolerance, and salt resistance or tolerance) and increased yield under stress.

Transgenes that confer or contribute to an altered grain characteristic, such as: A. Altered phosphorus content, for example, by the (1) Introduction of a phytase-encoding gene would enhance breakdown of phytate, adding more free phosphate to the transformed plant. For example, see, Van Hartingsveldt, et al., Gene 127:87 (1993), for a disclosure of the nucleotide sequence of an Aspergillus niger phytase gene.(2) Up-regulation of a gene that reduces phytate content. In maize, this, for example, could be accomplished, by cloning and then re-introducing DNA associated with one or more of the alleles, such as the LPA alleles, identified in maize mutants characterized by low levels of phytic acid, such as in Raboy, et al. (1990). B. Altered fatty acids, for example, by down-regulation of stearoyl-ACP desaturase to increase stearic acid content of the plant. See Knultzon, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:2624 (1992). C. Altered carbohydrates effected, for example, by altering a gene for an enzyme that affects the branching pattern of starch, a gene altering thioredoxin. (See, U.S. Pat. No. 6,531,648). See, Shiroza, et al., (1988) J. Bacteriol 170:810 (nucleotide sequence of Streptococcus mutans fructosyltransferase gene), Steinmetz, et al., (1985) Mol. Gen.

No. 6,232,529 (method of producing high oil seed by modification of starch levels (AGP)). The fatty acid modification genes mentioned above may also be used to affect starch content and/or composition through the interrelationship of the starch and oil pathways. D. Altered antioxidant content or composition, such as alteration of tocopherol or tocotrienols. For example, see, U.S. Pat. No. 6,787,683, US Patent Application Publication Number 2004/0034886 and WO 00/68393 involving the manipulation of antioxidant levels through alteration of a phytl prenyl transferase (ppt), WO 03/082899 through alteration of a homogentisate geranyl geranyl transferase (hggt).

Genes that confer male sterility There are several methods of conferring genetic male sterility available, such as multiple mutant genes at separate locations within the genome that confer male sterility, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,654,465 and 4,727,219 to Brar, et al., and chromosomal translocations as described by Patterson in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,861,709 and 3,710,511. In addition to these methods, Albertsen, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,068, describes a system of nuclear male sterility which includes: identifying a gene which is critical to male fertility; silencing this native gene which is critical to male fertility; removing the native promoter from the essential male fertility gene and replacing it with an inducible promoter; inserting this genetically engineered gene back into the plant; and thus creating a plant that is male sterile because the inducible promoter is not “on” resulting in the male fertility gene not being transcribed. Fertility is restored by inducing, or turning “on,” the promoter, which in turn allows the gene that confers male fertility to be transcribed. A. A dominant nuclear gene, Ms(tc) controlling male sterility. See, Elkonin, L. A., Theor. Appl. Genet. (2005) 111(7): 1377-1384. B.

Uses of Sorghum Sorghum is used as livestock feed, as sugar or grain for human consumption, as biomass, and as raw material in industry. The most common use of sorghum grain in the United States is as livestock feed, primarily to beef cattle, dairy cattle, hogs and poultry. The plant is also used as livestock feed in the form of fodder, silage, hay and pasture. Sorghum grain is most important as human food in areas outside the United States. In these areas, the grain is consumed in the form of bread, porridge, confectionaries and as an alcoholic beverage. Grain sorghum may be ground into flour and either used directly or blended with wheat or corn flour in the preparation of food products. In addition to direct consumption of the grain, sorghum has long been used in many areas of the world to make beer. The uses of sorghum, in addition to human consumption of kernels, include both products of dry and wet milling industries. The principal products of sorghum dry milling are grits, meal and flour. Starch and other extracts for food use can be provided by the wet milling process. Sorghum provides a source of industrial raw material. Industrial uses are mainly from sorghum starch from the wet-milling industry and sorghum flour from the dry milling industry. Sorghum starch and flour have application in the paper and textile industries. Other industrial uses include applications in adhesives, building materials and as oil-well muds. Considerable amounts of sorghum, both grain and plant material, have been used in industrial alcohol production. Characteristics of PHOIOMQKT Sorghum line PHOIOMQKT, a grain sorghum inbred parent, was developed by Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc., from the F2 population of the single cross PH8IOJBKT×PHOUOYV. Both PH8IOJBKT and PHOUOYV are proprietary lines of Pioneer Hi-Bred International, Inc. Sorghum line PHOIOMQKT can be used in breeding techniques to create hybrids. PHOIOMQKT is a male line that carries a gene for the restoration of fertility. When a sterile version of an inbred is pollinated by a male line that carries a gene for the restoration of fertility, it results in a fertile hybrid. Generally, the seed produced from this cross is the seed that is commercially sold. To produce sorghum line PHOIOMQKT, the pedigree method of breeding was used. The F1 cross was made at Pioneer's research station in Manhattan, Kans., during the summer of 2000. The F2 seed was obtained during the winter of 2000-2001 in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The F2 population was grown in Salinas, Puerto Rico, during the winter of 2001-2002, and forty-five heads were selected from the segregating population. All plants were self-pollinated. The F3 family was grown head to row at Salinas, Puerto Rico, during the summer of 2002. Plants were selfed, and two heads were saved from selected rows. The F4 family was grown during the summer of 2003 at Manhattan, Kans., where plants were selfed. A single selfed head was taken from selected rows. The F5 was grown during the winter of 2003-2004 in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where two heads were selfed. In addition, the line was test crossed to an inbred female tester line for evaluation of combining ability. The F6 was grown during the summer of 2004 at Manhattan, Kans., and the line was bulked from the best row of the two head rows grown that year. Yield trials were also grown at Manhattan, Kans., including the testcross hybrid made at F5. Additional testing and inbred selfing was carried out in 2005. Based on yield test results and nursery observations, the line was determined to restore fertility in A1 cytoplasm and to possess superior qualities in terms of hybrid performance. The line was observed to be uniform and stable, and was bulked at F6. No further selection within the line was practiced. Additional hybrid combinations were observed in Manhattan, Kans., and at other Pioneer research locations. The line was confirmed to be true breeding and named “PHOIOMQKT” in 2006. Sorghum line PHOIOMQKT has shown stability for traits listed in Table 1. It has been self-pollinated, bulk increased and checked for uniformity of plant type to assure genetic homozygosity and phenotypic stability. The line has been increased by hand pollination and in isolated field plantings with continued observation for uniformity. It has been observed to be uniform and stable for six generations. Sorghum line PHOIOMQKT has the characteristics shown in Table 1. This invention relates to seed of sorghum line PHOIOMQKT, plants of sorghum line PHOIOMQKT, plant parts of sorghum line PHOIOMQKT, and processes for making a plant that comprise crossing sorghum line PHOIOMQKT with another plant. This invention includes PHOIOMQKT with cytoplasm comprising a gene or genes that cause male sterility. This invention also relates to processes for making a plant containing in its genetic material one or more traits introgressed into PHOIOMQKT through backcross conversion and/or transformation, and to the seed, plant and plant arts produced thereby. This invention further relates to a hybrid sorghum seed, plant, or plant part produced by crossing the line PHOIOMQKT or a locus conversion of PHOIOMQKT with another plant. The terms variants, modification and mutant refer to a hybrid seed or a plant produced by that hybrid seed which is phenotypically similar to PHOIOMQKT. As used herein, the term “plant” includes plant cells, plant protoplasts, plant cell or tissue culture from which plants can be regenerated, plant calli, plant clumps and plant cells that are intact in plants or parts of plants such as flowers, kernels, panicles, leaves, stalks and the like. Sorghum tissue culture techniques are described in Bright and Jones, Cereal Tissue and Cell Culture, chapter 6, (Martinus Nijnoff/Dr. W. Junk, Amsterdam) on pages 176-203. The foregoing discovery has been described in detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of exemplification. However, it will be apparent that changes and modifications such as single gene modifications and mutations, somaclonal variants, variant individuals selected from populations of the plants of the instant variety, and the like, are considered to be within the scope of the present discovery. All references disclosed herein whether to journal, patents, published applications and the like are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.
