Step 3: Preparation of (R)-1-(2-chloro-7-fluoroquinoline-3-yl) ethane-1-ol
5 g (15.588 mmol) of B-chlorodiisopinocampheolborane ((+)DIP-Cl) was dissolved in anhydrous THF (10 ml), which was frozen at −47° C. 1.8 g (8.049 mmol) of 1-(2-chloro-7-fluoroquinoline-3-yl)ethane-1-one prepared in step 2 was dissolved in anhydrous THF (20 ml), which was added to the mixture above, followed by stirring at room temperature for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled down at 0° C., to which 1 ml of acetone and 1 ml of 10% Na2CO3 were added, followed by stirring at room temperature for 1 hour. Ethyl acetate and water were added to the reaction mixture. The separated organic layer was dried (Na2SO4) , filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate, 4/1) to give 1.4 g of the target compound (R)-1-(2-chloro-7-fluoroquinoline-3-yl)ethane-1-ol as a white solid (6.204 mmol, yield: 77%).
