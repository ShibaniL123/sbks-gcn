56 g (0.33 mol) of Intermediate 1-6(1) was dissolved in 560 ml of a tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution, and 234.2 g (1.65 mol) of phenyl iodide was added thereto. Then, the resultant mixture was heated and stirred at a temperature of 100Â° C. A reaction mixture obtained therefrom was cooled to room temperature to obtain a solid. Then, the obtained solid was filtered and dried, thereby completing the preparation of 81.54 g (yield=79.7%) of Intermediate 1-6(2).
