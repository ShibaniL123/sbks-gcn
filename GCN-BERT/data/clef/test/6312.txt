The entire contents of each of PCT/CA2013/050884 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/728,489 are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The present invention relates to novel compounds, compositions containing same and methods for inhibiting the human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (hFPPS) and directly or indirectly the human geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (hGGPPS) for the treatment or prevention of disease conditions associated with overexpression of these enzymes and intracellular accumulation of their corresponding metabolites farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and/or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), respectively. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE The human farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (hFPPS) enzyme is responsible for the catalytic elongation of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) to geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) and then to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) via the successive condensation of two isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) units (Scheme 1). Furthermore, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) is the key metabolic precursor for the biosynthesis of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which is catalyzed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS). Post-translational prenylation with FPP or GGPP of various proteins is crucial to their biological role. Consequently, inhibition of FPPS or GGPPS would result in decreased levels of both FPP and GGPP or only GGPP in a mammalian host, including a human host. Hence the human FPPS and GGPPS are recognized as important drug targets. It is anticipated that new FPPS or GGPPS inhibitors would have pleiotropic therapeutic effects, including in the treatment of bone diseases, in oncology, the treatment of elevated levels of cholesterol, prevention or treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer's), the treatment of infections, and any other disease state that is mediated by elevated levels of FPP or GGPP biosynthesis. Farnesylation or geranylgeranylarion of proteins confers membrane localization, promotes specific protein-protein interactions and is believed to play a critical role in intracellular trafficking and signal transduction (see for example Nguyen U. T. T. et al. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009, 5, 227-235). Addition of the FPP or GGPP lipidic moiety to the GTP-binding proteins (e.g. Ras, Rho, Rac, Rap) is also required in order to regulate the proliferation, invasive properties, and pro-angiogenic activity in human cancers (see for example Berndt, N.; Hamilton, A. D.; Sebti, S. M. Nature Rev. 2011, 11, 775-791; Caraglia, M. et al. Endocrine-Related Cancer 2006, 13, 7-26; Zhang, Y. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 5153-5162; Chapman, M. A. et al, Nature 2011, 471, 467-472. The role of hFPPS in protein prenylation in osteoclasts is known (see for example Dunford, J. E. et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001, 296, 235-242; Marma, M. S. et al. J. Med. Chem. 2007, 50, 5967-5975 and 7. Dunford, J. E. et al. J. Med. Chem. 2008, 51, 2187-2195) and nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (N-BP) inhibitors of hFPPS are commonly used in the treatment of osteoporosis, tumor-induced hypercalcemia, Paget's disease and osteolytic metastases (see Caraglia, M. et al, supra). Inhibitors of hFPPS have also been reported to stimulate the immune system by indirectly activating Vγ2\762 T cells (also known as Vγ9\762 T cells), thus mediating antitumor and antimicrobial effects, more specifically broad-spectrum antiviral and antibacterial effects (see for example Sanders, J. M. et al. J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 375-384; Zhang, Y. et al. J. Med. Chem. 2007, 50, 6067-6079; Morita, C. T. et al. Immunological Reviews 2007, 215, 59-76; Breccia, P. et al. J. Med. Chem. 2009, 52, 3716-3722 and Li, J. et al. J. Immunol. 2009, 182, 8118-8124. The antitumor effects of bisphosphonates inhibiting hFPPS (and/or its related enzyme hGGPPS) have been implicated in a variety of cancers (see Caraglia, M. et al, supra), including colorectal (see Notarnicola, M. et al. Oncology 2004, 67, 351-358), prostate, melanoma (see Laggner, U. et al. Clin. Immunol. 2009, 131, 367-373), breast (see for example Coleman, R. E. Eur. J. Cancer 2009, 45, 1909-1915), ovarian, brain (see Ellis, C. A. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2002, 99, 9876-9881) and multiple myeloma (cancers. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (N-BP) inhibitors of the human FPPS, such as zoledronic acid,) are disease modifying agents that improve survival in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) via mechanisms that are unrelated to their skeletal effects (see Morgan, G. J. et al. Lancet 2010, 376, 1989). Inhibitors of FPPS may also be used for lowering cholesterol or treating infectious diseases caused by microorganisms (e.g. Staphylococcus aureaus) and protozoan parasites, such as the groups of Leishmania, Plasmodium, Trypanosoma, Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium and others, by directly inhibiting the analogous FPPS enzyme of these organisms. Recent literature also suggests that over-expression of hFPPS and hGGPPS is associated with neurodegeneration in the human Alzheimer's brain (see for example: Eckert, G. P.; Hooff, G. P.; Strandjord, D. M.; Igbavboa, U.; Volmer, D. A.; Müllner, W. E.; Wood, W. G. Neurobiol. Disease 2009, 35, 251-257 and Hooff, G. P.; Wood, W. G.; Müllner, W. E.; Eckert, G. P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 2010, 1801, 896-905.). Accumulation of the phospho-Tau protein is strongly implicated in neuronal damage and the progression of diseases associated with dementia such as the Alzheimer's disease (see for example: Gong, C.-X.; Grundke-Iqbal, I.; Iqbal, K. Drug Aging 2010, 27, 351-365). Phospho-Tau levels can be modulated though the prenylation pathway from FPP→GGPP→RhoA→Cdc42→GSK3-β kinase→phospho-Tau protein. The use of statins (which indirectly down-regulate the biosynthesis of FPP and GGPP) in elderly subjects with normal cognitive functions is known to lead (over the course of several years) to a marked reduction of neurofibrillary tangle accumulation in the brain (detected at autopsy), as compared to non-users of statins. The potential benefits of statins in the treatment of Alzheimer's are currently under clinical investigation (see for example: Rebollo, A.; Pou, J.; Alegret, M. Aging Health 2008, 4, 171-180 and Mans, R. A.; McMahon, L. L. Li, L. Neuroscience 2012, 202, 1-9). Therefore, the aim of the present invention is to provide novel hFPPS and/or hGGPPS inhibitors and methods for treating hFPPS-dependent or hGGPPS-dependent disorders with advantageous biopharmaceutical properties as compared to the current drugs that target the human FPPS. Currently the only inhibitors of hFPPS that are approved drugs are the bisphosphonates, more importantly the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs), for example, zoledronic acid and risedronic acid. Recently, non-bisphosphonate exploratory compounds, such as the examples shown below (compounds 1 and 2), are also reported to inhibit the human FPPS (see R. Amstutz et al. WO 2009/106586; W. Jahnke et al. Nature Chem. Biol. 2010, 6, 660-666).

Specific definitions of variables in the Schemes are given for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the procedures described. The thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine core can be made in several ways, including via intermediate 3 as illustrated in Scheme 2. Cross-coupling of either the bromo intermediate 4 or the iodo intermediates 7b and 6 using suitable coupling fragments and catalysts, including but not limited to cross coupling reactions using Suzuki, Stille, Neghishi, Buchwald-Hartwig, Sonogashira and many other metal-catalyzed conditions (for a recent review article summarizing these types of reaction refer to Corbet, J.-P. and Mignani, G. Chem. Rev. 2006, 106, 2651-2710) leads to substitution at C-5 and/or C6 of the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine core of fragments with general structure 8. The reaction conditions are summarized under Scheme 2 and more details are given as part of the preparation of key fragments and specific examples. Conditions: (a) CH2(CN)2, NH4OAc, AcOH, C6H6, Dean-Stark trap, 95° C., 24 h (90%); (b) S8, Et2NH, pyridine, RT, 18 h (85%); (c) HCONH2, 130° C., 48 h (75-85%); (d) IC1, DCM, −10° C. (>98%); (e) (CH3O)2CHN(CH3)2, DMF, RT, 4 h (90%); (f) NBS, DMF, RT, 13 h in the dark (80%); (g) various cross-coupling reactions under standard Suzuki, Buchwald-Hartwig, Sonogashira and Stille conditions (isolated yields varied from 50% to 95%, none of these reactions were individually optimized); (h) TBAF, THF, 0° C. to RT, 3 h (>95%); (i) CF3CO2Ag, THF, −78° C., 15 min; (j) I2, THF, −78° C., 3 h (>98%). As illustrated in Scheme 3, thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amines of general structure 8, generated above from Scheme 2, can be coupled to a variety of other synthetic building blocks prepared according to the procedures denoted in the following reaction Schemes 3 and Examples or modifications thereof using readily available starting materials, reagents, and conventional procedures or variations thereof well-known to a practitioner of ordinary skill in the art of synthetic organic chemistry. For example, coupling with diethyl(iodomethyl)phosphonate, followed by hydrolysis of the ethyl groups with TMSBr and MeOH, can give the mono-phosphonate derivative 9. An alternative protocol for making mono-phosphonates such as 9 is shown in Scheme 4 [i.e. general structure 17, where R═H and X═PO(OH)2]; in our hands, this protocol provides better yields. The synthesis of bisphosphonates with general structure 10 was achieved following the protocol we reported previously (see Lin, Y.-S. et al. J. Med. Chem. 2012, 55, 3201-3215), as shown in Scheme 3. Synthesis of highly substituted thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine inhibitors can also be achieved starting from 2,5-dihydroxy-1,4-dithiane, following literature procedures; examples include Trangerg, C. E. et al J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 382-389; and Hesse, S. et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 2007, 48, 5261-5264. Scheme 4 outlines the synthesis of the 6-bromo-4-chlorothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine (14) intermediate. Subsequently, displacement of the 4-chloro moiety by a nucleophilic group (including but not limited to the amino moiety of an amino acids or an aminophosphonic acid, with the phosphonate group appropriately protected, for example as the diethyl ester) provide intermediate 15 which is amenable to a variety of cross-coupling reactions at C-6 using Suzuki, Stille, Neghishi, Buchwald-Hartwig, Sonogashira and many other metal-catalyzed conditions; for examples refer to Ghorab et al., Heteroatom Chem., 2004, 15, 57-56). Further structural modifications are possible following a number of reaction pathwayssuch as the examples shown in Scheme 4. Alternatively, the cross-coupling reaction can be performed first using intermediate 13 followed by chlorination at C-4 to give intermediate 16, which can then be reacted via an SNAr mechanism with different nucleophilic substituted amines to give 17 (Scheme 4) Synthesis of thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine inhibitors with an amino substituent at C-5 can also be achieved via Buchwald-Hartwig amination of the iodo intermediate 7b (Scheme 2) and also from the 4a,7a-dihydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4(3H)-one 12 (from Scheme 4) using the synthetic protocols shown in Scheme 5. For example, the C-5 NH2 moiety of intermediate 24 provides a convenient precursor for modifications, which include but are not limited to alkylation of the amine or coupling to a carboxylic acid to give an amide bond, using protocols known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Alternatively, the synthesis of thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine inhibitors with a carbon substituent at C-5, can also be achieved from the methyl 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethyl)thiophene-3-carboxylate 27 as shown in Scheme 6, following protocols known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions at C-6 can involve such known reactions as Suzuki, Stille, Neghishi, Buchwald-Hartwig, Sonogashira and many other metal-catalyzed conditions. Oxidation of an alcohol to the aldehyde or carboxylic acid under mild conditions can be carried out using various reagents and protocols, such as IBX for making the aldehyde 30 or the Pinnick oxidation (see Wong, L. S. and Sherburn, M. S. Org Lett. 2003, 5, 3603-3606 and references therein), trichloroisocyanutic acid/TEMPO oxidation (De Luca, L. and Giacomelli, G. J. Org. Chem. 2003, 68, 4999-5001) or tetra-n-propylammonium peruthenate in the presence of NMO-H2O mixture (see Schmidt, A.-K. C. and Stark, C. B. W Org. Lett 2011, 13, 4164-4167) for making the carboxylic acid analog 35. Intermediate 16 (from Scheme 4) was also used to prepare thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine inhibitors with a carbon linker at C-4 using protocols known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis as shown in Scheme 7. The following examples are provided to further illustrate details for the preparation and use of the compounds of the present invention. They are not intended to be limitations on the scope of the instant invention in any way, and they should not be so construed. Furthermore, the compounds described in the following examples are not to be construed as forming the only genus that is considered as the invention, and any combination of the compounds or their moieties may itself form a genus. Those skilled in the art will readily understand that known variations of the conditions and processes of the following preparative procedures can be used to prepare these compounds. All temperatures are in degrees Celsius unless noted otherwise.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of the 2-Aminopyridinyl Tetraethyl Bisphosphonic Acids of General Structure 10 from Intermediate 8 (Scheme 3) Step 1 In a pressure vessel, the thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amines 8 (1 eq.), triethyl orthoformate (6 eq.), and diethylphosphite (1.2 eq.) were dissolved in toluene and stirred at 130° C. for 3 days. The solution was cooled to room temperature and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography on a CombiFlash instrument, using a solvent gradient from 1:1 EtOAc/Hexanes to 100% EtOAc and then to 20% MeOH in EtOAc to give the tetraethyl bisphosphonate esters in 70-85% isolated yield. Step 2: This Procedure was Used for all Examples Requiring the Conversion of a Tetraethyl or Diethyl Ester Bisphosphonate or Mono-Phosphonate, Respectively, to the Corresponding Free Acids A solution of the tetraethyl bisphosphonate ester (1 eq.) in CH2Cl2 was cooled to 0° C. and trimethylsilyl bromide (15 eq.) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 days (longer reaction periods of up to 5 days were required when the TMSBr reagent was old); the completion of conversion was monitored by 31P NMR. The mixture was then diluted with HPLC grade MeOH (˜10 mL) and stirred at RT for 1 h, the solvent was evaporated to dryness and this step was repeated four times. The organic solvents were evaporated under vacuum, the residue was dissolve in 0.5 mL MeOH, excess CH2Cl2 (˜10 mL) was added to induce precipitations of the final product. In cases where the final solid was colored or more like a gum than a solid, the sample was re-dissolved in HPLC grade MeOH, the flask was placed in a sonicating bath for a few minutes to assure particle dispersion and the desired product was crashed out of solution by the addition of deionized water. The solid product was collected by filtration, washed with DCM (2×) and Et2O (2×) and dried under vacuum to give the final compound as a white powder in nearly quantitative yields.

The crude residue was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel eluted with hexane-ethyl acetate (7:1) to give intermediate 37 (where R6 is tolyl) as a yellow solid. 1H-NMR (CDCl3) δ: 2.43 (s, 3H, —CH3), 7.30 (d, J=8.00 Hz, 2H, Phenyl), 7.70 (d, J=8.10 Hz, 2H, Phenyl), 8.31 (s, 1H, 5-H thienopyrimidine), 9.24 (s, 1H, 2-H thienopyrimidine), 10.25 (s, 1H, —CH═O). The conversion of intermediate 37 (Scheme 7) to Examples of general structure 38 and 39 was achieved using the same protocol as those previously described for the preparation of inhibitors with general structure 32 and 33 (Scheme 6), such as Example 26-1 and Example 27-1. Inhibitors of the Human Farnesyl Pyrophosphate Synthase In vitro Enzymatic Inhibition Assay for hFPPS: In vitro sensitized inhibition assay for hFPPS (M2): All assays were run in triplicate using 4 ng of the human recombinant FPPS (˜1 nM hFPPS) and 0.2 μM of each substrates, GPP and IPP (3H-IPP, 3.33 mCi/mmol) in a final volume of 100 μL buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.7, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM TCEP, 20 μg/mL BSA and 0.01% Triton X-100. For assays run with a 10 min pre-incubation period, the enzyme and inhibitor were incubated in the assay buffer in a volume of 80 μL at 37° C. for 10 min. After 10 min, the substrates were added to start the reaction and also bring the inhibitor and substrate to the desired final concentrations. After addition of all substrates, all assays were incubated at 37° C. for 8 min. Assays were terminated by the addition of 200 μL of HCl/methanol (1:4) and incubated for 10 min at 37° C. The assay mixture was then extracted with 700 μL of ligroin (in order to separate reaction products from unused substrate), dried through a plug of anhydrous MgSO4 and 300 μL of the ligroin phase was combined with 8 mL of scintillation cocktail. The radioactivity was then counted using a Beckman Coulter LS6500 liquid scintillation counter.

A dilution method was used to determine EC50 values for inhibition for each target compound; compounds were diluted in culture medium. Cells were seeded in 96 well plates at a density 10,000 cells per well incubated for 2 h before the addition of 10 μL of compound at half-logarithmic dilutions from 100 nM to 333 μM with a fixed final volume. Plates were then incubated for 72 h at 37° C. in the presence 5% CO2, following which an MTT, 4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reagent was used according to the manufacturers documentation (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Plates were read at OD490 nM on a Dynex MRX microplate reader (Magellan Biosciences, Chelmsford Mass.). Results were analyzed to obtain dose-response curves and EC50 calculations using GraphPad PRISM version 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.). Compounds were routinely tested at fixed concentrations of 10 μM and 100 μM in the above described antiproliferation assay using the multiple myeloma cells RPMI 8226. A 20-40% decrease in cell proliferation was observed with many compounds described in this inventions at 100 μM. A dose-dependent inhibition study was performed only with the most potent analogs; an example is shown below and compared to the potency of zoledronic acid and risedronic acid EC50 (μM) in MM cells Compound RPMI-8226 Zoledronic acid 11 Risedronic acid 13 Example 7-1 8.5 Phospho-Tau Bioassay: The commercially available INNOTEST® PHOSPHO-TAU(181P) solid-phase enzyme immunoassay was used. In this assay, the phosphorylated Tau protein or fragments are captured by a first monoclonal human specific antibody, HT7 (IgG1). Human immortalized neurons were treated with various compounds at Human cell culture homogenates are added and incubated with biotinylated AT270 (IgG1) monoclonal. This antigen-antibody complex is then detected by a peroxidase-labeled streptavidin. After addition of substrate working solution, samples develop a color. The color intensity is a measure for the amount of phosphorylated Tau protein in the sample. This assay has been standardized in numerous research laboratories (for examples see Vanderstichele, H. et al. Alzheimer's & Dementia 2012, 8, 65-73; Zimmermann, R. et al. Journal of Alzheimer's Diseases 2011, 25, 739-745; Blennow, K. et al. Molecular and Chemical Neuropathology 1995, 26, 231-245). Human neuroblastomas SH-SY5Y cell line were used and purchased at the ATCC under the label CRL2266. All compounds were tested in three fixed concentrations at 100 nM, 1 μM and 100 μM in duplicates. We used the 6 well culture plates to grown a significant density of neurons (330,000 cells/well). Cells were grown to 80% confluence in MEM-F12 media with 10% fetal bovine serum, the exposed for 24 hours to the different inhibitors. After one day, the supernatant was removed (and saved at −20° C.). The cell are washed repeatedly in PBS buffer and saved at −80° C. ELISA assays were performed on neuronal cell homogenates using a standardized assay developed by INNOGENETICS called Innotest Total Tau also refers to as the hTau assay and Innotest phospho-Tau (P181). Assays were performed as per manufacturer protocol. The concentration units are in pg of P-Tau per μg of total protein in the cell homogenate. However, the effects of zoledronic acid and risedronic acid on the levels of P-Tau and T-Tau cannot not be properly evaluated due to the fact that these compounds are highly toxic; compounds which cause stress or damage to the neurons stimulate the production of P-Tau protein. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was measured using a commercial kit; the maximum toxicity was based on % lactic acid dehydrogenases activity in the medium; the control was set at zero.
