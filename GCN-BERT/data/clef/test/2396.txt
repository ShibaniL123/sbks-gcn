DESCRIPTION OF THE TEXT FILE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY The contents of the text file submitted electronically herewith are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety: A computer readable format copy of the Sequence Listing (filename: DECP—066—01US_SeqList_ST25.txt, date recorded: Nov. 7, 2014, file size 6 kilobytes). FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to methods of inhibiting TIE2 kinase useful in the treatment of tumor growth, tumor invasiveness, tumor intravasation, tumor dissemination, tumor metastasis, and tumor immunotolerance. Specifically, the invention relates to methods of using compositions of Formula I herein described as potent inhibitors of TIE2 for treating breast cancer growth, invasiveness, intravasation dissemination, metastasis, and immunotolerance. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Tunica interna endothelial cell kinase-2 (TIE2) is largely restricted to expression in endothelial cells of the vasculature, and in a subset of bone marrow derived TIE2 expressing monocytes (TEMs). TIE2 is the receptor for angiopoietin 1 (ANG1), angiopoietin 2 (ANG2), and angiopoietin 4 (ANG4) and this signaling system plays an important role in both angiogenesis (sprouting of new vessels from existing vessels) and vasculogenesis (de novo new vessel formation). TEMs are a subset of circulating monocytes and tissue macrophages that have proangiogenic and provasculogenic activity in tumor models (De Palma M D et al, Cancer Cell 2005; 8:211-226). TIE2 inhibition decreases the ability of TEMs to associate with blood vessels (Mazzieri R, Cancer Cell 2011; 19:512-526) and markedly decreases the proangiogenic activity of this macrophage subset (De Palma M, Clin Cancer Res 2011; 17(16):5226-5232). Cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and anti-angiogenic treatments damage the tumor-associated vasculature thus leading to a hypoxic tumor environment. The hypoxic tumor environment leads to rebound tumor vascularization by activating an angiogenic switch from the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGFR2 pathway to the ANG/TIE2 pathway in vascular endothelial cells. The recruitment of pro-vasculogenic TEMs from the bone marrow to these hypoxic tumor sites facilitates this revascularization by the association of TEMs with endothelial cells within the tumor microenvironment. TEMs and TIE2-expressing endothelial cells are thus believed to play an important role in the revascularization of tumors after these treatments, leading to progression due to the growth of residual tumor cells (De Palma M, et al. Trends Immunol 2007; 28:519-524). TIE2 is also a mediator of osteoclast differentiation, and TIE2 inhibition led to decreased osteolytic bone invasion and decreased tumor growth in the 4T1 mouse breast cancer model (Dales J P, et al. Int J Oncol 2003; 22:391-397). Beyond the physiologic expression of TIE2 on endothelial, monocyte/macrophage, and osteoclast cells of the tumor microenvironment, TIE2 has also been demonstrated to be present on breast cancer cells. Tumor cell expression of TIE2 was associated with an elevated risk of metastatic disease and an independent predictor of prognosis on multivariate analysis (Min Y, et al. Cancer Res 2010; 70:2918-2828). Significantly, a subset of TIE2-expressing tissue macrophages are located within specialized vascular structures known as tumor microenvironment for metastases (TMEMs). Recent observations have linked TIE2-expressing macrophages within TMEM structures as being essential for extravasation of breast cancer cells into the vascular circulation and subsequent dissemination to distal metastatic sites (Condeelis J, Pollard J W. Cell 2006; 124:263-6; Ginter P S, et al. Cancer Res 2012; 72(24 Suppl):Abstract #P6-02-04). Thus inhibition of TIE2, and of the macrophages within TMEM structures, may lead to a decrease in new metastases. TIE2-expressing tissue macrophages (TEMs) have recently been demonstrated to play a role in breast cancer immunotolerance. TEMs from breast tumors are able to suppress tumor-specific immune responses. Specifically, suppressive functions of TEMs are similarly driven by TIE2 and VEGFR kinase activity. TEMs isolated from breast cancer tissue can function as antigen-presenting cells that elicit only a weak proliferation of T cells. Blocking TIE2 and VEGFR kinase activity induced TEMs to change their phenotype into cells with features of myeloid dendritic cells with robust antigen-presentation. Immunosuppressive activity of TEMs is also associated with high CD86 surface expression and extensive engagement of T regulatory cells in breast tumors. TIE2 and VEGFR kinase activities were required to maintain high CD86 surface expression levels and to convert T cells into immunosuppressive regulatory cells (Ibberson M, et al. Clin Cancer Res 2013; 19:3439-3449). The polyoma middle-T antigen (PyMT) syngeneic mouse breast cancer model utilizes the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter, a breast specific promoter, to express PyMT in mouse breast tissue. In this model, PyMT breast cancer cells are implanted in the mouse mammary fat pad, and these cancers metastasize and lead to the death of the mouse. Unlike xenograft models, the PyMT model utilizes fully immunocompetent mice. Metastasis in this model is known to be modulated by TIE2 expressing macrophages within TMEM vascular structures. Thus, there is a need for new treatments for diseases associated with TIE2. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Methods of the present invention find utility in the inhibition TIE2 kinase. As a result of this inhibition the present invention is useful in the treatment or prophylaxis against of tumor growth, invasiveness, intravasation, dissemination, metastasis, and tumor immunotolerance. In particular, the invention relates to methods of using compositions of Formula I, described below, as potent inhibitors of TIE2 for treating breast cancer growth, invasiveness, intravasation, dissemination, metastasis, and immunotolerance: wherein n is an integer from 0 to 7;X is the basic radical of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt;provided that when n is 0, the composition of Formula I is the parent free base. In some embodiments, HX is absent whereby the structure of Formula I is the parent free base.

Clin Invest (1999) 103: 341-345), and hematological cancers (Muller et al, Leukemia Research (2002) 26: 163-168; Hou et al, Leukemia Research (2008) 32: 904-912).

The term “salt” refers to pharmaceutically acceptable salts The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” also refers to a salt of the compositions of the present invention having an acidic functional group, such as a carboxylic acid functional group, and a base. The term “treating” with regard to a subject, refers to improving at least one symptom of the subject's disorder. Treating can be curing, improving, or at least partially ameliorating the disorder. The term “administer”, “administering”, or “administration” as used in this disclosure refers to either directly administering a composition or pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound or a composition to a subject, or administering a prodrug derivative or analog of the composition or pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound or composition to the subject, which can form an equivalent amount of active compound within the subject's body. An “effective amount,” when used in connection with medical uses is an amount that is effective for providing a measurable treatment, prevention, or reduction in the rate of pathogenesis of a disease of interest. The present invention relates to methods of the treatment (blocking) or prophylaxis against tumor growth, invasiveness, intravasation, dissemination, metastasis, and tumor immunotolerance. The method comprises administering to a patient in need of treatment or reduction of prophylactic effects of these conditions an effective amount of a composition of Formula I herein described in a dosing regimen that regulates TIE2 inhibition. The amount of composition described herein needed for achieving a therapeutic effect may be determined empirically in accordance with conventional procedures for the particular purpose. Generally, for administering therapeutic agents (e.g. compositions of Formulae I or II (and/or additional agents) described herein) for therapeutic purposes, the therapeutic agents are given at a pharmacologically effective dose. A “pharmacologically effective amount,” “pharmacologically effective dose,” “therapeutically effective amount,” or “effective amount” refers to an amount sufficient to produce the desired physiological effect or amount capable of achieving the desired result, particularly for treating the disorder or disease. An effective amount as used herein would include an amount sufficient to, for example, delay the development of a symptom of the disorder or disease, alter the course of a symptom of the disorder or disease (e.g., slow the progression of a symptom of the disease), reduce or eliminate one or more symptoms or manifestations of the disorder or disease, and reverse a symptom of a disorder or disease. For example, administration of therapeutic agents to a patient suffering from cancer provides a therapeutic benefit not only when the underlying condition is eradicated or ameliorated, but also when the patient reports a decrease in the severity or duration of the symptoms associated with the disease, e.g., a decrease in tumor burden, a decrease in circulating tumor cells, an increase in progression free survival. Therapeutic benefit also includes halting or slowing the progression of the underlying disease or disorder, regardless of whether improvement is realized. In one embodiment of the invention, the composition of Formula I is 1-(3-tert-butyl-1-(quinolin-6-yl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-3-(2-fluoro-4-(2-(methylcarbamoyl)pyridin-4-yloxy)phenyl)urea para-toluene sulfonic acid salt of Formula II which is a potent inhibitor of TIE2, the receptor tyrosine kinase for angiopoietin ligands. The compositions of Formula I find utility in cancers wherein TIE2 expression, either in the tumor cell or in the tumor microenvironment, causes tumor progression by mechanisms mediating primary tumor growth, primary tumor invasiveness, tumor intravasation into the blood stream, tumor cell dissemination, tumor metastases to distal tissues, or tumor immunotolerance. Inhibition of TIE2 kinase by the composition of Formula I therefore finds utility in the treatment of cancer by inhibiting processes including primary tumor growth, primary tumor invasiveness, tumor intravasation into the blood stream, tumor cell dissemination, tumor metastases to distal tissues, or tumor immunotolerance. Therapeutic concentrations of the compositions of Formula I block cells within the tumor microenvironment known to cause tumor growth, invasion, intravasation, dissemination, metastases, of tumor induced immunotolerance. Such cell types within the tumor microenvironment include TIE2-expressing monocytes, TIE2-expressing macrophages, and TIE2-expressing endothelial cells. Tumors responsive to angiopoietin/TIE2 signaling include but are not limited to breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gliomas, colorectal cancer, and hematological malignancies. In another embodiment, the composition of Formula I when the HX is absent is the free base compound 1-(3-tert-butyl-1-(quinolin-6-yl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-3-(2-fluoro-4-(2-(methylcarbamoyl)pyridin-4-yloxy)phenyl)urea having the structure: The composition of Formula I may be administered as a single agent or in combination with other therapeutic agents known to treat cancers. Such other therapeutic agents include radiation therapy, anti-tubulin agents, DNA alkylating agents, DNA synthesis-inhibiting agents, DNA intercalating agents, anti-estrogen agents, anti-androgens, steroids, anti-EGFR agents, kinase inhibitors, topoisomerase inhibitors, Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, DNA methylation inhibitors, anti-HER2 agents, anti-angiogenic agents, proteasome inhibitors, thalidomide, lenalidomide, antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs), immunomodulating agents, or cancer vaccines. Effective amounts, toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to about 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in about 50% of the population). The dosage can vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. In some embodiments, compositions and methods that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. A therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from in vitro assays, including, for example, cell culture assays. Also, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 as determined in cell culture, or in an appropriate animal model. Levels of the described compositions in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay. The dosage can be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment. In certain embodiments, the prophylactic effect will result in a quantifiable change of at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 50%, at least about 70%, or at least about 90%. In some embodiments, the effect will result in a quantifiable change of about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 50%, about 70%, or even about 90% or more. Therapeutic benefit also includes halting or slowing the progression of the underlying disease or disorder, regardless of whether improvement is realized. When the compositions of Formulae I or II are used in combination with other anti-cancer agents, the other anti-cancer agent may be dosed independently of the dosing schedule of the composition of Formulae I or II. The other anti-cancer agent may be dosed at its previously established therapeutic dose and dosing schedule, or its dose and dosing schedule may be modified to optimize efficacy, safety or tolerability when used in combination with the compositions of Formulae I or II. Further, any compositions of Formulae I or II (and/or additional agents) described herein can be administered to a subject as a component of a composition that comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or vehicle. Such compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient so as to provide the form for proper administration.

Any composition (and/or additional agents) described herein can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, drops, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the composition is in the form of a capsule (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro eds., 19th ed. 1995), incorporated herein by reference. Where necessary, the salts herein described can also include a solubilizing agent. Also, the agents can be delivered with a suitable vehicle or delivery device as known in the art. Combination therapies outlined herein can be co-delivered in a single delivery vehicle or delivery device. Compositions for administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as, for example, lignocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. In one embodiment, the salts of Formulae I and/or II (and/or additional agents) described herein is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for a mode of administration. In certain embodiments, routes of administration include, for example: intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intranasal, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectally, by inhalation, or topically, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. In some embodiments, the administering is effected orally or by parenteral injection. The mode of administration can be left to the discretion of the practitioner, and depend in-part upon the site of the medical condition. In most instances, administration results in the release of any agent described herein into the bloodstream. In specific embodiments, it may be desirable to administer locally to the area in need of treatment or blocking. In one embodiment, the salts (and/or additional agents) described herein is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for oral administration to humans. Compositions for oral delivery can be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs, for example.

A total of 10 mice were implanted in each group. Molecular Imaging, Inc.'s Animal Care and Use Committee approved all the experimental protocols and conducted experiments in compliance with all the laws, regulations and guidelines of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Treatment was initiated by oral administration (gavage) of Compound 1 twice daily or vehicle (0.4% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose in water) and/or intravenous administration (IV) of paclitaxel every five days or vehicle (10% ethanol, 10% Cremophor EL and 80% saline) according to individual body weight on the day of treatment at 0.2 mL per 20 g when tumor size reached approximately 850 mg. Animals were dosed for 21 days. Body weights and tumor measurements were recorded three times weekly. Tumor burden (mg) was estimated from caliper measurements by the formula for the volume of a prolate ellipsoid assuming unit density as: Tumor burden (mg)=(L×W2)/2, where L and W are the respective orthogonal tumor length and width measurements (mm). In the PyMT model, both Compound 1 and paclitaxel groups evidenced tumor growth inhibition. Compound 1 in combination with paclitaxel demonstrated additive activity (FIG. 1). These data evidence in vivo activity by Compound 1 and show correlation to enzymatic and cell data.

Formalin-fixed tumor samples were then placed in paraffin blocks. Formalin fixed-paraffin embedded tissue slides were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated to distilled water through a graduated series of alcohol rinses. Antigenic retrieval was performed using Dako's PT Link Module with a Tris/EDTA buffer target retrieval solution at 95° C. for 20 minutes. Once the slides cooled down, they were loaded onto a Dako AutostainerPlusLink for immunohistochemical staining at room temperature with F4/80 and CD31 antibodies, to stain for macrophages and endothelial cells, respectively. Endogenous peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase activity in the tissues was quenched with a Dual Endogenous Enzyme Block solution (Dako, S2003) for 5 minutes. Non-specific protein binding was blocked with serum free Protein Block (Dako, X0909) for 5 minutes. The rat anti mouse CD31 primary antibody was then incubated on the experimental tissue sections for 30 minutes at an immunogenic concentration of 1:100. The primary antibody was then conjugated with a rabbit anti rat immunoglobulin secondary antibody (Dako, E0468). The secondary antibody was then amplified with a goat anti rabbit peroxidase labeled polymer (Dako, K4003) for 30 minutes.
