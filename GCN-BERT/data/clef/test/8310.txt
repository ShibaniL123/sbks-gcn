Step 2. 2,4-Difluoro-3-(3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridin-5-yl)aniline
5-Chloro-3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (348 mg, 0.956 mmol, Intermediate 2), 2,4-difluoro-3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)aniline (293 mg, 1.148 mmol), chloro(2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-triisopropyl-1,1'-biphenyl)[2-(2'-amino-1,1'-biphenyl)]palladium(II) (Pd XPhos G2) (75 mg, 0.096 mmol) and potassium phosphate (406 mg, 1.91 mmol) were placed in a flask and the flask was evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen three times. Then dioxane (20 mL) and degassed water (2 mL) were added, and reaction mixture was stirred at 90° C. for 2 h. After cooling to r.t., the reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, the resulting mixture was washed with brine, The separated organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate. The solvents were evaporated in vacuo and obtained crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (380 mg, 87%).
