STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not applicable. REFERENCE TO A MICROFICHE APPENDIX Not applicable. BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field This disclosure relates to polymeric compositions. More specifically, this disclosure relates to single pellet polymeric compositions. 2. Background Synthetic polymeric materials, such as polypropylene and polyethylene resins, are widely used in the manufacturing of a variety of end-use articles ranging from medical devices to food containers. While articles constructed from synthetic polymeric materials have widespread utility, one drawback to their use is that these materials tend to remain semi-permanently in a natural environment. In response to environmental concerns, interest in the production and utility of more readily biodegradable polymeric materials has been increasing. These materials, also known as “green materials,” may undergo accelerated degradation in a natural environment. SUMMARY The disclosure includes a pellet composed of a polymeric blend having a composition of between 99.5-51 wt % polyolefin and 0.5-49.9 wt % polylactic acid. The disclosure also includes a pellet, wherein the pellet includes a polymeric blend that includes a polyolefin, a semi-crystalline or amorphous polylactic acid, and a component, wherein the third component is an epoxy-functionalized polyethylene, an epoxy-functionalized polypropylene, SEBS, ethylene methacrylate copolymer, an ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, or combinations thereof. The disclosure further includes a pellet that includes a blend, wherein the blend is composed of a Ziegler-Natta or metallocene-catalyzed polypropylene homopolymer, a random propylene copolymer, an impact copolymer or high density polyethylene. The blend is further composed of a semi-crystalline polylactic acid or amorphous PLA and a maleated polyolefin.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of various embodiments. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. Various terms as used herein are shown below. To the extent a term used in a claim is not defined below, it should be given the broadest definition skilled persons in the pertinent art have given that term as reflected in printed publications and issued patents at the time of filing. Further, unless otherwise specified, all compounds described herein may be substituted or unsubstituted and the listing of compounds includes derivatives thereof. Further, various ranges and/or numerical limitations may be expressly stated below. It should be recognized that unless stated otherwise, it is intended that endpoints are to be interchangeable. Further, any ranges include iterative ranges of like magnitude falling within the expressly stated ranges or limitations. Disclosed herein are single pellets blends of at least one polyolefin and polylatic acid. “Single pellet” means that two or more pellets of resin include all components of the blend and are substantially homogenous, i.e., the two or more pellets include a composition that is substantially identical. In certain embodiments, the composition of the single pellet is between 99.5-51 wt % polyolefin and 0.5-49.9 wt % polylactic acid. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the single pellet may further include a third component, which in certain non-limiting embodiments, may be a modifier or compatibilitzer. The single pellets may be used directly, i.e., without combination with other polymers or modifiers, for processes including, but not limited to, film/sheet extrusion, oriented film, blown film, injection molding, injection stretch blow molding, extrusion molding, extrusion thermoforming, foaming, fiber and tape applications. The polyolefin in the single pellet may be polypropylene. In an alternative embodiment, the polyolefin may be polyethylene. In an embodiment, the polyolefin is polypropylene. The polypropylene may be a homopolymer provided however that the homopolymer may contain up to 5% of another alpha-olefin, including but not limited to C2-C8 alpha-olefins such as ethylene and 1-butene. Despite the potential presence of small amounts of other alpha-olefins, the polypropylene is generally referred to as a polypropylene homopolymer. Polypropylene homopolymers suitable for use in this disclosure may include any type of polypropylene known in the art with the aid of this disclosure. For example, the polypropylene homopolymer may be atactic polypropylene, isotactic polypropylene, hemi-isotactic, syndiotactic polypropylene, or combinations thereof. A polymer is “atactic” when its pendant groups are arranged in a random fashion on both sides of the chain of the polymer. In contrast, a polymer is “isotactic” when all of its pendant groups are arranged on the same side of the chain and “syndiotactic” when its pendant groups alternate on opposite sides of the chain. In hemi-isotactic polymer, every other repeat unit has a random substituent. In an embodiment, a polypropylene homopolymer suitable for use in this disclosure may have a density of from 0.895 g/cc to 0.920 g/cc, alternatively from 0.900 g/cc to 0.915 g/cc, and alternatively from 0.905 g/cc to 0.915 g/cc as determined in accordance with ASTM D1505; a melting temperature of from 150° C. to 170° C., alternatively from 155° C. to 168° C., and alternatively from 160° C. to 165° C. as determined by differential scanning calorimetry; a melt flow rate of from 0.5 g/10 min. to 50 g/10 min., alternatively from 1.0 g/10 min. to 10 g/10 min., and alternatively from 1.5 g/10 min to 5.0 g/10 min. as determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 condition “L”; a tensile modulus of from 200,000 psi to 350,000 psi; alternatively from 220,000 psi to 320,000 psi, and alternatively from 250,000 psi to 320,000 psi as determined in accordance with ASTM D638; a tensile stress at yield of from 3,000 psi to 6,000 psi, alternatively from 3,500 psi to 5,500 psi, and alternatively from 4,000 psi to 5,500 psi as determined in accordance with ASTM D638; a tensile strain at yield of from 5% to 30%, alternatively from 5% to 20%, and alternatively from 5% to 15% as determined in accordance with ASTM D638; a flexural modulus of from 120,000 psi to 330,000 psi, alternatively from 190,000 psi to 310,000 psi, and alternatively of from 220,000 psi to 300,000 psi as determined in accordance with ASTM D790; a Gardner impact of from 3 in-lb to 50 in-lb, alternatively from 5 in-lb to 30 in-lb, and alternatively from 9 in-lb to 25 in-lb as determined in accordance with ASTM D2463; a Notched Izod Impact Strength of from 0.2 ft lb/in to 20 ft lb/in, alternatively from 0.5 ft lb/in to 15 ft lb/in, and alternatively from 0.5 ft lb/in to 10 ft lb/in as determined in accordance with ASTM D256A; a hardness shore D of from 30 to 90, alternatively from 50 to 85, and alternatively from 60 to 80 as determined in accordance with ASTM D2240; and a heat distortion temperature of from 50° C. to 125° C., alternatively from 80° C. to 115° C., and alternatively from 90° C. to 110° C. as determined in accordance with ASTM D648. Examples of polypropylene homopolymers suitable for use in this disclosure include without limitation 3371, 3271, 3270, and 3276, which are polypropylene homopolymers commercially available from Total Petrochemicals USA, Inc. In an embodiment, the polypropylene homopolymer (e.g., 3371) has generally the physical properties set forth in Table 1.

The HCPP may contain primarily isotactic polypropylene. The isotacticity in polymers may be measured via 13C NMR spectroscopy using meso pentads and can be expressed as percentage of meso pentads (% mmmm). As used herein, the term “meso pentads” refers to successive methyl groups located on the same side of the polymer chain. In an embodiment, the HCPP has a meso pentads percentage of greater than 97%, or greater than 98%, or greater than 99%. The HCPP may comprise some amount of atactic or amorphous polymer. The atactic portion of the polymer is soluble in xylene, and is thus termed the xylene soluble fraction (XS %). In determining XS %, the polymer is dissolved in boiling xylene and then the solution cooled to 0° C. that results in the precipitation of the isotactic or crystalline portion of the polymer. The XS % is that portion of the original amount that remained soluble in the cold xylene. Consequently, the XS % in the polymer is indicative of the extent of crystalline polymer formed. The total amount of polymer (100%) is the sum of the xylene soluble fraction and the xylene insoluble fraction, as determined in accordance with ASTM D5492-98. In an embodiment, the HCPP has a xylene soluble fraction of less than 1.5%, or less than 1.0%, or less than 0.5%. In an embodiment, an HCPP suitable for use in this disclosure may have a density of from 0.895 g/cc to 0.920 g/cc, alternatively from 0.900 g/cc to 0.915 g/cc, and alternatively from 0.905 g/cc to 0.915 g/cc as determined in accordance with ASTM D1505; a melt flow rate of from 0.5 g/10 min. to 500 g/10 min., alternatively from 1.0 g/10 min. to 100 g/10 min., and alternatively from 1.5 g/10 min. to 20 g/10 min. as determined in accordance with ASTM D1238; a secant modulus in the machine direction (MD) of from 350,000 psi to 420,000 psi; alternatively from 380,000 psi to 420,000 psi, and alternatively from 400,000 psi to 420,000 psi as determined in accordance with ASTM D882; a secant modulus in the transverse direction (TD) of from 400,000 psi to 700,000 psi, alternatively from 500,000 psi to 700,000 psi, and alternatively from 600,000 psi to 700,000 psi as determined in accordance with ASTM D882; a tensile strength at break in the MD of from 19,000 psi to 28,000 psi, alternatively from 22,000 psi to 28,000 psi, and alternatively from 25,000 psi to 28,000 psi as determined in accordance with ASTM D882; a tensile strength at break in the TD of from 20,000 psi to 40,000 psi, alternatively from 30,000 psi to 40,000 psi, and alternatively of from 35,000 psi to 40,000 psi as determined in accordance with ASTM D882; an elongation at break in the MD from 50% to 200%, alternatively from 100% to 180%, and alternatively from 120% to 150% as determined in accordance with ASTM D882; an elongation at break in the TD of from 50% to 150%, alternatively from 60% to 100%, and alternatively from 80% to 100% as determined in accordance with ASTM D882; a melting temperature of from 150° C. to 170° C., alternatively from 155° C. to 170° C., and alternatively from 160° C. to 170° C. as determined by differential scanning calorimetry; a gloss at 45° of from 70 to 95, alternatively from 75 to 90, and alternatively from 80 to 90 as determined in accordance with ASTM D2457; a percentage haze of from 0.5% to 2.0%, alternatively from 0.5% to 1.5%, and alternatively from 0.5% to 1.0% as determined in accordance with ASTM D1003; and a water vapor transmission rate of from 0.15 to 0.30 g-mil/100 in2/day, alternatively from 0.15 to 0.25 g-mil/100 in2/day, and alternatively from 0.20 to 0.21 g-mil/100 in2/day as determined in accordance with ASTM F-1249-90. An example of an HCPP suitable for use in this disclosure includes without limitation 3270, which is an HCPP commercially available from Total Petrochemicals USA, Inc. The HCPP (e.g., 3270) may generally have the physical properties set forth in Table 2.

In certain embodiments, the polypropylene copolymer may be a propylene random copolymer, including, for example, LX 02-15, a metallocene-manufactured polypropylene commercially available from Total Petrochemicals USA, Inc. Other examples of polypropylene copolymers include propylene random copolymers made from Zieger-Natta catalysts, such as the 6000-, 7000-, and 8000-series commercially available from Total Petrochemicals USA, Inc. In other embodiments, the polypropylene copolymer may be a polypropylene heterophasic copolymer (PPHC) wherein a polypropylene homopolymer phase or component is joined to a copolymer phase or component. The PPHC may comprise from greater than 6.5 wt. % to less than 20 wt. % ethylene by total weight of the PPHC, alternatively from 8.5 wt. % to less than 18 wt. %, alternatively from 9.5 wt. % to less than 16%. The copolymer phase of a PPHC may be a random copolymer of propylene and ethylene, also referred to as an ethylene/propylene rubber (EPR). PP heterophasic copolymers show distinct homopolymer phases that are interrupted by short sequences or blocks having a random arrangement of ethylene and propylene. In comparison to random copolymers, the block segments comprising the EPR may have certain polymeric characteristics (e.g., intrinsic viscosity) that differ from that of the copolymer as a whole. Without wishing to be limited by theory, the EPR portion of the PPHC has rubbery characteristics which, when incorporated within the matrix of the homopolymer component, may function to provide increased impact strength to the PPHC. In an embodiment, the EPR portion of the PPHC comprises greater than 14 wt. % of the PPHC, alternatively greater than 18 wt. % of the PPHC, alternatively from 14 wt. % to 18 wt. % of the PPHC. The amount of ethylene present in the EPR portion of the PPHC may be from 38 wt. % to 50 wt. %, alternatively from 40 wt. % to 45 wt. % based on the total weight of the EPR portion. The amount of ethylene present in the EPR portion of the PPHC may be determined spectrophotometrically using a fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) method. Specifically, the FTIR spectrum of a polymeric sample is recorded for a series of samples having a known EPR ethylene content. The ratio of transmittance at 720 cm−1/900 cm−1 is calculated for each ethylene concentration and a calibration curve may then be constructed. Linear regression analysis on the calibration curve can then be carried out to derive an equation that is then used to determine the EPR ethylene content for a sample material. The EPR portion of the PPHC may exhibit an intrinsic viscosity different from that of the propylene homopolymer component. Herein intrinsic viscosity refers to the capability of a polymer in solution to increase the viscosity of said solution. Viscosity is defined herein as the resistance to flow due to internal friction. In an embodiment, the intrinsic viscosity of the EPR portion of the PPHC may be greater than 1 dl/g, alternatively from 2.0 dl/g to 3.0 dl/g, alternatively from 2.4 dl/g to 3.0 dl/g, alternatively from 2.4 dl/g to 2.7 dl/g, alternatively from 2.6 dl/g to 2.8 dl/g. The intrinsic viscosity of the EPR portion of the PPHC is determined in accordance with ASTM D5225. In an embodiment, the PPHC may have a melt flow rate (MFR) of from 0.5 g/10 min. to 500 g/10 min., alternatively from 1 g/10 min. to 100 g/10 min., alternatively from 1.5 g/10 min. to 50 g/10 min., alternatively from 2.0 g/10 min. to 20 g/10 min. Excellent flow properties as indicated by a high MFR allow for high throughput manufacturing of molded polymeric components. In an embodiment, the PPHC is a reactor grade resin without modification, which may also be termed a low order PP. In some embodiments, the PPHC is a controlled rheology grade resin, wherein the melt flow rate has been adjusted by various techniques such as visbreaking. For example, MFR may be increased by visbreaking as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,503,990, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. As described in that publication, quantities of peroxide are mixed with polymer resin in flake, powder, or pellet form to increase the MFR of the resin. MFR as defined herein refers to the quantity of a melted polymer resin that will flow through an orifice at a specified temperature and under a specified load. The MFR may be determined using a dead-weight piston Plastometer that extrudes polypropylene through an orifice of specified dimensions at a temperature of 230° C. and a load of 2.16 kg in accordance with ASTM D1238. Representative examples of suitable PPHCs include without limitation 4920W and 4920WZ, which are impact copolymer resins commercially available from Total Petrochemicals USA Inc. In an embodiment, the PPHC (e.g., 4920W) has generally the physical properties set forth in Table 3.

(J/m) 1.0 (50) ASTM D256A Thermal Heat Deflection, ° C. 90 D648 In another embodiment, the polypropylene is a high melt strength polypropylene. A high melt strength polypropylene may be a semi-crystalline polypropylene or polypropylene copolymer matrix containing a heterophasic copolymer. The heterophasic copolymer may include ethylene and higher alpha-olefin polymer such as amorphous ethylene-propylene copolymer, for example. In certain embodiments of the present disclosure, the high melt strength polypropylene may be formed when a multifunctional monomer and a radical initiator are used to form long chain branched and crosslinked polyolefin compositions In one or more embodiments, the multifunctional monomers generally include difunctional monomers, trifunctional monomers and combinations thereof, for example. Suitable multifunctional monomers include acrylic monomers. The acrylic monomers may include 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy) ethyl acrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, tridecyl acrylate, tridecylacrylate hexanediol diacrylate, lauryl acrylate, alkoxylated lauryl acrylate, caprolactone acrylate, 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, polyethylene glycol diacrylate, neopentane diol diacrylate, polyethylene glycol diacrylate and combinations thereof, for example. In one or more embodiments, the multifunctional monomers may be hydrophobic or hydrophilic. As used herein, the term “hydrophilic” refers to multifunctional monomers having oxygen or nitrogen atoms in their backbone structure. For example, the hydrophilic multifunctional monomers may include 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy) ethyl acrylate, tetrahydrofufuryl acrylate, polyethylene glycol (200) diacrylate, tetraethylene glycol diacrylate, triethylene glycol diacrylate, tripropylene glycol diacrylate, polyethylene glycol (400) diacrylate or combinations thereof. The radical initiator may include any free radical initiator known to one skilled in the art. Suitable radical initiators include organic peroxides, azo-containing compounds, azide compounds and the like, peroxydicarbonate, and combinations thereof, for example. For example, the radical initiator may be a commercially available peroxide such as TRIGANOX® 301 (commercially available from Akzo-Nobel Chemicals, Inc.) or LUPERSOL® 101 (n-butylperoxy neodecanoate), for example. The radical initiator may also be a commercially available peroxydicarnobonate such as Perkadox 24 L commercially available from Akzo-Nobel Chemicals. Some other components such as acrylate-based ionomers such as Dymalink 705 commercially available at Cray Valley can also readily undergo thermal polymerization, providing free radicals for the multifunctional monomers. In one or more embodiments, contacting of the above-mentioned components may generally occur by blending the polyolefin, multifunctional monomer, and radical initiator components in a single step process. The blending may occur by introducing the polyolefin, multifunctional monomer, and radical initiator components into a system capable of combining the components to facilitate long chain branching onto the polyolefin. For example, the blending may be accomplished by introducing the polyolefin (e.g., polypropylene), multifunctional monomerinto a batch mixer, continuous mixer, single screw extruder or twin screw extruder, for example, to form a homogeneous mixture or solution, introducing a free radical intiator and providing pressure and temperature conditions so as to graft copolymerize the multifunctional monomer and silane compound onto the polyolefin. In one example, reactive extrusion may be employed to graft copolymerize the multifunctional monomer onto the polyolefin. The polyolefin, multifunctional monomer, and radical initiator components are introduced into an extruder which provides intimate contact between the components introduced therein as well as pressure and temperature conditions to permit graft polymerization multifunctional monomer onto the polyolefin. The multifunctional monomer may participate in the grafting reaction to bridge the polyolefin chains. During grafting, a first functional group of the multifunctional monomer reacts with the polyolefin and the first and second functional groups of the multifunctional monomer can react with another polyolefin, thereby facilitating long chain branching to the polyolefin. The polymerization of the multifunctional monomer with the polyolefin occurs readily as a result of the radical initiator forming free radicals at the functional groups of the multifunctional monomer. Advantageously, the radical initiator acting upon the multifunctional monomer results in a substantially lower occurrence of polyolefin chain scission. During grafting, free radical reactions at the reactive functional groups of the multifunctional monomer effectively suppress radical attack and main chain scission of the polyolefin. Thus, the resulting polyolefin composition has a substantially higher molecular weight and a lower melt flow rate. Advantageously, the use of radical initiator Perkadox results in a substantially lower occurrence of polyolefin chain scission. During melt extrusion, Perkadox free radicals can abstract tertiary hydrogen of polypropylene, and then form stable structure before incorporating with multifunctional monomers, effectively suppress beta scission of the polyolefin. Thus, the resulting polyolefin composition has a substantially higher molecular weight. In an embodiment, the polyethylene is present in the component in an amount of from 1 wt. % to 99 wt. % by total weight of the multi-component article, alternatively from 5 wt. % to 70 wt. %, alternatively from 10 wt. % to 50 wt. %. In another embodiment, the high-melt strength polypropylene includes a functionalized polypropylene, which includes polypropylene, a free radical initiator and a graftable monomer. The polypropylene can be a homopolymer, or a copolymer containing at least 50% by weight of polypropylene and a remaining portion of a C(2)-C(20) olefin. The polypropylene can have a crystallinity of at least 30%, and a stereoregularity of at least 60%. The polypropylene can be isotactic or syndiotactic, with a melt flow index (MFI) of from 0.1 to 100 g/10 min, optionally from 1.0 to 80 g/10 min, optionally from 5.0 to 50 g/10 min. MFI being measured according to ASTM D 1238 standard at 230° C. under a load of 2.16 kg. In embodiments of the present invention the polypropylenes can have a weight average molecular weight distribution (MWD), determined by ASTM D5296-05, ranging from 150,000 to 850,000, optionally ranging from 200,000 to 600,000, optionally ranging from 300,000 to 500,000, optionally ranging from 250,000 to 400,000, and optionally ranging from 350,000 to 400,000. In certain embodiments, the polypropylene of the high-melt strength polypropylene can be an impact copolymer (ICP). The ICP may be one having a density range from 0.88 to 0.93 g/cm(3), optionally from 0.89 to 0.92 g/cm(3), and, optionally from 0.9 to 0.91 g/cm(3). In an embodiment, the ICP may have a melting point ranging from 155 to 170° C., optionally from 158 to 166° C., optionally from 160 to 165° C. ICP polypropylene may have a melt flow rate (MFR) ranging from 0.1 to 40 g/10 min. In an alternative embodiment, the ICP polypropylene may have a MFR ranging from 1 to 30 g/10 min, optionally from 3 to 20 g/10 min, optionally from 5 to 10 g/10 min. The ICPs used herein can have a weight average molecular weight distribution (MWD) ranging from 280,000 to 850,000, optionally ranging from 320,000 to 780,000, optionally ranging from 420,000 to 700,000. The initiator is generally a peroxide, optionally an organic peroxide, and more particularly an alkyl peroxide, such as ditertiary butyl peroxide, tertiary butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, p-menthane peroxide, p-menthane hydroperoxide (some might be repeats) tert-butylcumyl peroxide, 1,3-di(2-tert-butylper-oxyisopropyl)benzene, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butyl-peroxy)hexane, di(tert-butyl)peroxide, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy)-3-hexane, and 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di-tert-butylperoxyhexane (DHBP). The peroxide can also be peroxydicarbonate such as Perkadox 24 L commercially available at AkzoNobil. Damlink 705, an ionomer supplied by Cray Valley can also act as initiators through its thermal polymerization. The peroxide can range from 0.001 to 0.5% by weight, optionally from 0.01 to 0.3%, optionally from 0.01 to 0.1%, with respect to the polypropylene. The graftable monomer generally contains a carbonyl, carboxylic acid or acid anhydride functional group and can be chosen from the following: acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid, crotonic acid, citraconic acid, maleic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, crotonic anhydride and citraconic anhydride, maleic anhydride, and allyl methacrylate. The graftable monomer can range from 0.01 to 10% by weight, optionally from 0.1 to 10%, optionally from 1.0 to 5.0%, with respect to the polypropylene. In an embodiment, the graftable monomer is maleic anhydride, and the functionalized polypropylene is maleated polypropylene. A commercial maleated PP can be used for the functionalized polypropylene, such as for example Polybond 3150 or Polybond 3200, commercially available from Chemtura. In an embodiment, the functionalized polypropylene includes 0.1 to 10% by weight, optionally from 0.1 to 5%, optionally from 0.1 to 3%, of a multi-functional monomer, such as di-acrylates, triacrylates, etc. Multi-functional monomers can increase the degree of grafting. The multi-functional monomer can be an acrylate containing from 3 to 5 acrylate groups, such as trimethylolpropane triacrylate, trimethylolpropane ethoxylate triacrylate, glycerol propoxylate triacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate, di(trimethylolpropane) tetraacrylate, pentaerythritol tetraacrylate, pentaerythritol ethoxylate tetraacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, pentaerythritol ethoxylate triacrylate, and polyethylene glycol diacrylate. In an embodiment, the functionalized polypropylene is maleated polypropylene, formed in the presence of an acrylate multi-functional monomer. Commercial maleated polypropylene resins can be used to make the high melt strength polypropylene; however, the reactive extrusion of polypropylene with maleic anhydride and peroxide generally involves a significant break-up of high molecular weight chains, or vis-breaking Reducing polypropylene vis-breaking during maleated PP production can increase the number of potential long chain branches that can be formed when the high melt strength polypropylene of the invention includes coupling reactions and can be beneficial for long term performance of PP-based ionomers upon neutralization. In an embodiment, the high melt strength polypropylene includes an acid neutralizer, and the high melt strength polypropylene is a polypropylene ionomer. A graftable monomer containing a carbonyl, carboxylic acid or acid anhydride functional group can be neutralized by metal cations. For instance, maleated polypropylene contains carboxylic acids in the polymer chain. The addition of acid neutralizers yields a polypropylene ionomer. The polar groups tend to congregate, creating crosslinks throughout the polymer chain. At high temperatures, the attraction of the polar groups is weakened. Thus, the crosslinks created by acid neutralization are reversible, and it is possible to increase the melt strength of polypropylene while retaining its thermoplastic character. Acid neutralizers used for the present invention can be salts, optionally metallic salts. The cationic portion of the metal salt can be an alkali cation, an alkaline-earth cation, or a transition-metal cation, while the anionic potion of the metal salt can be an alcoholate, carboxylate, hydroxide, oxide, alkyl, carbonate, or hydrogen-carbonate. The acid neutralizer can be chosen from the following: sodium hydroxide, calcium oxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, sodium methoxide, sodium acetate, magnesium ethoxide, diethylzinc, aluminium butoxide, zirconium butoxide, potassium hydroxide, zinc acetate, zinc stearate, and the like. The acid neutralizer can be potassium hydroxide, zinc acetate, or zinc stearate. The acid neutralizer can be present in an amount from 0.1 to 10% by weight, optionally from 0.1 to 7.5% by weight, optionally 0.1 to 5% by weight. Small amounts of water, such as from 0.5 to 1% by weight, can be used to expedite the neutralization reaction. Acrylate ionic monomers, such as SR 732, commercially available at Sartomer, can be added to aid the neutralization reaction in an amount from 0.1 to 5% by weight, optionally from 0.1 to 2.5% by weight, optionally from 0.5 to 1% by weight. In another embodiment, the high melt strength polypropylene includes an amine coupling agent. The amine can be chosen from the group containing C(4)-C(12)alkylene diamines, hexamethylene diamine (HMDA), polypropylene glycol)-bis-(2-propylamine) hexamethylenediamine, dodecamethylenediamine, and 1,3-phenylenediamine. A desirable coupling agent is 1,3-phenylenediamine. The amine can be present in an amount from 0.1 to 5% by weight, optionally from 0.1 to 2.5% by weight, optionally from 0.5 to 2% by weight. In an embodiment, the high melt strength polypropylene includes maleated polypropylene, formed in the presence of an acrylate multi-functional monomer, a coupling agent, and an acid neutralizer. According to this embodiment, the interactions of the previously described embodiments are synergistically combined to enhance the melt strength of the polymer and increase long chain branching, without compromising its thermoplastic character. In certain embodiments, the high melt strength polypropylene can further include conventional additives such as, for example, stabilizers, antioxidants, lubricants, antistatic agents, nucleating agents, foaming agents, glass fibers or any other fillers. In certain embodiments, the components of the high melt strength polypropylene can be combined using reactive blending, such as reactive extrusion. The formation of the high melt strength polypropylene can include either one or two reactive extrusions. In one embodiment, the polypropylene, free radical initiator, graftable monomer, and optionally a multi-functional monomer, are combined in a first reactive extrusion to form a functionalized polypropylene, such as maleated polypropylene. The functionalized polypropylene can then be combined with a neutralizing agent, coupling agent, or some combination thereof in a second reactive extrusion. In other embodiments, the components of the functionalized polypropylene can be combined with the neutralizing agent, coupling agent, and other additives in a single extrusion. In any case, the order of introduction of the different components into the mixers is not critical. Such a process can be performed using any extruder type, such a twin-screw extruder, the extruder can be a device that extrudes pellets as well as an extruder which produces sheet, or any other known type. The reactive extrusion can be performed at a temperature above the melting point of the polypropylene, generally from 150° to 300° C., optionally from 160° to 250° C., or optionally from 190° to 230° C.

In an embodiment, the polyolefin comprises high density polyethylene (HDPE). Herein an HDPE has a density of equal to or greater than 0.941 g/cc, alternatively from 0.941 g/cc to 0.965 g/cc, alternatively from 0.945 g/cc to 0.960 g/cc.

Herein an LDPE is defined as having a density range of from 0.910 g/cm3 to 0.940 g/cm3, alternatively from 0.917 g/cm3 to 0.935 g/cm3, and alternatively from 0.920 g/cm3 to 0.930 g/cm3. The LDPE may be further characterized by the presence of increased branching when compared to an HDPE. The LDPE may be a homopolymer or a copolymer, for example a copolymer of ethylene with one or more alpha-olefin monomers such as propylene, butene, hexene, etc. In an embodiment, the LDPE is a homopolymer.

In an embodiment, the polyolefin comprises a linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE). LLDPE is a substantially linear polyethylene, with significant numbers of short branches. LLDPE is commonly generated by the copolymerization of ethylene with longer chain olefins. LLDPE differs structurally from low-density polyethylene because of the absence of long chain branching. In an embodiment, the LLDPE is a copolymer, for example a copolymer of ethylene with one or more alpha-olefin monomers such as propylene, butene, hexene, etc. An LLDPE suitable for use in this disclosure may generally have a density, determined by ASTM D792, of from 0.900 g/cc to 0.920 g/cc, or from 0.905 g/cc to 0.918 g/cc, or from 0.910 g/cc to 0.918 g/cc.

For example, the polyolefin may be prepared using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst, metallocene catalyst, or combinations thereof. The polyethylene, for example, may be prepared using a chromium oxide catalyst, or any other suitable catalysts. In an embodiment, the polyolefin is prepared using Ziegler-Natta catalysts, which are typically based on titanium and organometallic aluminum compounds, for example triethylaluminum (C2H5)3Al. Ziegler-Natta catalysts and processes for forming such catalysts are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,298,718; 4,544,717; and 4,767,735, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In another embodiment, the polyolefin may be prepared using a metallocene catalyst. Metallocene catalysts may be characterized generally as coordination compounds incorporating one or more cyclopentadienyl (Cp) groups (which may be substituted or unsubstituted, each substitution being the same or different) coordinated with a transition metal through π bonding. Examples of metallocene catalysts and processes for forming such catalysts are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,794,096 and 4,975,403, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Examples of polyolefins prepared through the use of metallocene catalysts are described in further detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,158,920; 5,416,228; 5,789,502; 5,807,800; 5,968,864; 6,225,251; 6,777,366; 6,777,367; 6,579,962; 6,468,936; 6,579,962; and 6,432,860, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The polyolefin may also be prepared using any other catalyst or catalyst system such as a combination of Ziegler-Natta and metallocene catalysts, for example as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,056,991 and 6,653,254, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The polyolefin may be formed by placing one or more olefin monomer (e.g., ethylene, propylene) alone or with other monomers in a suitable reaction vessel in the presence of a catalyst (e.g., Ziegler-Natta, metallocene, etc.) and under suitable reaction conditions for polymerization thereof. Any suitable equipment and processes for polymerizing the olefin into a polymer may be used. For example, such processes may include solution phase, gas phase, slurry phase, bulk phase, high pressure processes or combinations thereof. Such processes are described in detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,525,678; 6,420,580; 6,380,328; 6,359,072; 6,346,586; 6,340,730; 6,339,134; 6,300,436; 6,274,684; 6,271,323; 6,248,845; 6,245,868; 6,245,705; 6,242,545; 6,211,105; 6,207,606; 6,180,735; and 6,147,173, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In an embodiment, the polyolefin is formed by a gas phase polymerization process. One example of a gas phase polymerization process includes a continuous cycle system, wherein a cycling gas stream (otherwise known as a recycle stream or fluidizing medium) is heated in a reactor by heat of polymerization. The heat is removed from the cycling gas stream in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external to the reactor. The cycling gas stream containing one or more monomers may be continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The cycling gas stream is generally withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product may be withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer may be added to replace the polymerized monomer. The reactor pressure in a gas phase process may vary from 100 psig to 500 psig, or from 200 psig to 400 psig, or from 250 psig to 350 psig. The reactor temperature in a gas phase process may vary from 30° C. to 120° C., or from 60° C. to 115° C., or from 70° C. to 110° C., or from 70° C. to 95° C., for example as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,543,399; 4,588,790; 5,028,670; 5,317,036; 5,352,749; 5,405,922; 5,436,304; 5,456,471; 5,462,999; 5,616,661; 5,627,242; 5,665,818; 5,677,375; and 5,668,228, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In an embodiment, the polyolefin is formed by a slurry phase polymerization process. Slurry phase processes generally include forming a suspension of solid, particulate polymer in a liquid polymerization medium, to which monomers and optionally hydrogen, along with catalyst, are added. The suspension (which may include diluents) may be intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components can be separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquefied diluent employed in the polymerization medium may include a C3 to C7 alkane (e.g., hexane or isobutene). The medium employed is generally liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. A bulk phase process is similar to that of a slurry process. However, a process may be a bulk process, a slurry process or a bulk slurry process. In certain embodiments, the single pellet blend includes polylactic acid. Any suitable polylactic acid may be used in this disclosure. For example, polylactic acid may comprise poly-L-lactide (PLLA), poly-D-lactide (PDLA), poly-LD-lactide (PDLLA), or combinations thereof. The polylactic acid may be amorphous or semi-crystalline. Polylactic acid may be prepared using any suitable method. For example, polylactic acid may be prepared by dehydration condensation of lactic acid, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,310,865, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Alternatively, polylactic acid may be prepared by synthesis of a cyclic lactide (also known as cyclic dimer) from lactic acid followed by ring opening polymerization of the cyclic lactide. An example of such a process is described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,758,987, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Catalysts may be used in the production of polylactic acid. The catalysts may be of any type suitable for the process. Examples of such catalysts include without limitation tin compounds such as tin octylate, titanium compounds such as tetraisopropyl titanate, zirconium compounds such as zirconium isopropoxide, and antimony compounds such as antimony trioxide. Additives such as those described previously may be introduced to the polylactic acid composition. Additional processes to produce polylactic acid are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,821,327; 5,770,682; 5,508,378; 5,470,944; and 4,797,468, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The polylactic acid may include additives and modifiers. In certain embodiments, the polylactic acid may include stabilizers, ultra-violet screening agents, oxidants, anti-oxidants, anti-static agents, ultraviolet light absorbents, fire retardants, processing oils, mold release agents, coloring agents, pigments/dyes, nucleators, plasticizers, regular and nano-fillers, stereocomplex polylactic acids, chain extenders, and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the chain extender may be an acrylic copolymer, such as Biostrength 700 manufactured by Biostrength, or a peroxide. The aforementioned additives may be used either singularly or in combination to form various formulations of the polymer. These additives may be included in amounts effective to impart the desired properties. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the third component is a peroxide. Non-limiting examples of peroxides include Luperox-101 and Tigonix-301. The amount of peroxide in the polyolefin/polylactic acid blend may be from about 200 ppm to about 9000 ppm by weight. In certain embodiments of the present disclosure, the third component may be a cavitating booster. The cavitating booster may comprise a functionalized polyolefin, for example, polypropylene, such as a polypropylene that is functionalized with a polar monomer. Examples of such polar monomers include without limitation maleic anhydride (MAH); acrylic acid; alkyl acrylic acid; vinylsulfonic acid; acrylamido-2-methyl-propanesulfonic acid; alkyl sulfonic acid; acrylonitrile; acrylate esters for example methylmethacrylate; styrene sulfonic acid; and the like; and combinations thereof. In an embodiment, the cavitating booster comprises polypropylene functionalized with maleic anhydride which is hereinafter termed maleated polypropylene (PP-g-MAH). Examples of cavitating boosters suitable for use in this disclosure include without limitation POLYBOND-3002 and X-10083, which are PP-g-MAH and both are commercially available from Crompton Corporation. In an embodiment, a cavitating booster suitable for use in this disclosure (e.g., POLYBOND-3002) may generally have the physical properties set forth in Table 5. TABLE 5 POLYBOND-3002 Physical Properties Typical Value Test Method Melt Flow Rate (MFR), g/10 min. 9.3 ASTM D1238 MAH Index 0.6 FTIR % Moisture 0.02 ASTM D789 Yellowness Index 4 ASTM D5290 In an embodiment, the cavitating booster is present in the blend in an amount of from 0.5 weight percent (wt. %) to 15 wt. % by total weight of the blend, alternatively from 2 wt. % to 10 wt. %, alternatively from 3 wt. % to 5 wt. %. In an embodiment, the cavitating booster is a maleic anhydride grafted PP with MAH content in an amount of from 0.2 wt. % to 15 wt. % by total weight of maleated PP, alternatively from 0.5 wt. % to 10 wt. %, alternatively from 0.5 wt. % to 5 wt. %. In certain other embodiments, the single pellets include a reactive modifier as a third component. Herein, reactive modifiers refer to polymeric additives that when added to a molten polyolefin and PLA (e.g., PP/PLA blend or PE/PLA blend) form compounds in situ that serve to stabilize the interface between the polyolefin and PLA. The compounds formed in situ act as compatibilizers and the reactive modifiers are precursors to these compatibilizers. In certain embodiments, the reactive modifier includes, but is not limited to, SEBS, an ethylene methacrylate copolymer, an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, and an epoxy-functionalized polyolefin. Examples of epoxy-functionalized polyolefins suitable for use in this disclosure include without limitation epoxy-functionalized polypropylene, including, but not limited to, glycidyl methacrylate grafted polypropylene (PP-g-GMA), epoxy-functionalized polyethylene, including, but not limited to, polyethylene co glycidyl methacrylate (PE-co-GMA), or combinations thereof. An example of an epoxy-functionalized polyethylene suitable for use in this disclosure includes LOTADER AX8840, which is a PE-co-GMA containing 8% GMA that is commercially available from Arkema. In another embodiment, the reactive modifier comprises PP-g-GMA. PP-g-GMA may be prepared by any suitable method such as for example by grafting GMA onto polypropylene in the presence of an initiator such as peroxide. Examples of initiators suitable for use in this disclosure include without limitation LUPERSOL 101 and TRIGANOX 301, which are peroxides commercially available from Arkema. In an embodiment, the initiator may be used in an amount of from 0.03% to 2 wt. % by total weight of the biodegradable polymeric compositions, alternatively from 0.2 wt. % to 0.8 wt. %, alternatively from 0.3 wt. % to 0.5 wt. %. The grafting reaction of GMA onto PP may be conducted in a molten state inside an extruder such as for example a single extruder or a twin-screw extruder. Hereinafter, such process is referred to as reactive extrusion. A feedstock comprising PP, GMA, and initiator (i.e., peroxide) may be fed into an extruder reactor sequentially along the extruder, alternatively the feedstock (i.e., PP, GMA, and initiator) may be pre-mixed outside and fed into the extruder. In an alternative embodiment, the PP-g-GMA is prepared by grafting GMA onto polypropylene in the presence of an initiator and a multi-functional acrylate comonomer. The multi-functional acrylate comonomer may comprise polyethylene glycol diacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA), or combinations thereof. The multi-functional acrylate comonomer may be further characterized by a high flash point. The flash point of a material is the lowest temperature at which it can form an ignitable mixture in air, as determined in accordance with ASTM D93. The higher the flash point, the less flammable the material, which is a beneficial attribute for melt reactive extrusion. In an embodiment, the multi-functional acrylate comonomer may have a flash point of from 50° C. to 120° C., alternatively of from 70° C. to 100° C., alternatively of from 80° C. to 100° C. Examples of multi-functional acrylate comonomers suitable for use in this disclosure include without limitation SR259 (polyethylene glycol diacrylate), CD560 (alkoxylated hexanediol diacrylate), and SR351 (TMPTA), which are commercially available from Sartomer. The grafting reaction of GMA onto polypropylene in the presence of a peroxide and the multi-functional acrylate comonomer polyethylene glycol diacrylate is depicted in Scheme 1. Without wishing to be limited by theory, the hydrogens on the tertiary carbon of polypropylene molecules can be easily abstracted in the presence of peroxide during reactive extrusion, forming polypropylene macroradicals with unpaired electrons. The polypropylene macroradicals, which are generally unstable, tend to form free radicals through a step referred to as “β-scission.” β-scission refers to a family of reactions wherein bonds that are in beta-position to a radical are cleaved resulting in the formation of a double bond and a new radical. The β-scission reaction is believed to be responsible mainly for the formation of internal double bonds thus its occurrence is correlated with the allylic content of the final polymer. β-scission is typically favored over the grafting reaction (i.e., the addition of the GMA) resulting in both a lower grafting of GMA and a polypropylene having a lower average molecular weight. However, in the reactions comprising a multi-functional acrylate comonomer, the multi-functional acrylate comonomer may function to readily capture the polypropylene micro-radicals resulting in the formation of a more stable intermediate (i.e., polypropylene-acrylate radicals). The relatively stable propylene-acrylate radicals tend to react more readily with GMA, which is an acrylate type monomer, and consequently favor the grafting reaction. Furthermore, as shown in Scheme 1, multiple free radicals may exist on the grafted propylene-acrylate molecules thus making it easier to capture and initiate the reaction of GMA. The reactivity of GMA towards acrylate free radicals may be higher than towards polypropylene tertiary macro-radicals. Consequently, PP-g-GMA prepared using a reaction mixture comprising a multi-functional acrylate comonomer may display a higher degree of grafting than a PP-g-GMA prepared using an otherwise similar composition in the absence of a multi-functional acrylate comonomer. PP-g-GMA prepared using a multifunctional acrylate comonomer is hereinafter referred to as a highly grafted GMA (HGGMA). In an embodiment, the HGGMA which is a reactive modifier, is prepared from a reaction mixture comprising polypropylene present in an amount of from 80 wt. % to 99.5 wt. %, alternatively from 90 wt. % to 99 wt. %, and alternatively from 95 wt. % to 99 wt. %; GMA present in an amount of from 0.5 wt. % to 20 wt. %, alternatively from 1.0 wt. % to 10 wt. %, and alternatively from 1.0 wt. % to 5.0 wt. %; a multi-functional acrylate comonomer (e.g., SE259) present in an amount of from 0.5 wt. % to 15 wt. %, alternatively from 1.0 wt. % to 10 wt. %, and alternatively from 1.0 wt. % to 5.0 wt. %; and an initiator (e.g. LUPERSOL 101) present in an amount of from 0.05 wt. % to 1.5 wt. %, alternatively from 0.2 wt. % to 0.8 wt. %, and alternatively from 0.3 wt. % to 0.5 wt. %. The ratio of GMA:multi-functional acrylate comonomer in the HGGMA may range from 1:5 to 10:1, alternatively from 1:2 to 5:1, and alternatively from 1:1 to 3:1. The amount of grafting of GMA onto the polyolefin may vary depending on a variety of factors such as the type of materials used and processing conditions. Such parameters may be varied by one of ordinary skill in the art with the benefits of this disclosure to produce reactive modifiers having a user-desired grafting yield. The grafting yield may be determined using any suitable method. For example, the grafting yield may be determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy. In an embodiment, a method for determining the grafting yield comprises obtaining the FTIR spectra of polymeric samples having a mixture of PP and GMA wherein the amount of each component is known. A calibration curve may be generated by plotting the signal intensity at one or more wavelengths as a function of component concentration. The FTIR spectra of a PP-g-GMA sample may then be determined and compared to the calibration curve in order to determine the grafting yield. This method is described in more detail in Angew. Makromol. Chem., 1995, V229 pages 1-13. In an embodiment, a HGGMA may have a grafting yield of from 0.2 wt. % to 15 wt. %, alternatively from 0.5 wt. % to 10 wt. %, alternatively from 1.0 wt. % to 5.0 wt. %. In an embodiment, the reactive modifier is present in the component in an amount of from 0.5 wt. % to 15 wt. % based on total weight of the single pellet, alternatively from 1.0 wt. % to 10 wt. %, alternatively from 3.0 wt. % to 5.0 wt. %. The single pellet may be formed in a one-step compounding process or a multi-step compounding process. For instance, in certain embodiments, the blends may be compounded in an extruder, such as a twin screw extruder, and then pelletized. In other embodiments, the single pellet may be formed by mechanically mixing the components of the blend, extruded, and then pelletized. In still other embodiments, such as those blends that include a peroxide or other chain extender, the blend may be reactively extruded and then pelletized.

EXAMPLES The disclosure having been generally described, the following examples are given as particular embodiments of the disclosure and to demonstrate the practice and advantages thereof. It is understood that the examples are given by way of illustration and are not intended to limit the specification or the claims to follow in any manner. Example 1 The single pellets can be further produced in a way that PLA phases can be selectively encapsulated inside rubber domains, which lead to superior stiffness/impact balance. One example is a formulation based on Total Petrochemicals LX3 12-04, a 13 g/10 min melt flow CRed from 2.0 g/10 min impact copolymers with ethylene content of ˜16%. LX3 12-04 was blended with 20% Tafiner (EPDM rubber) and 10% PLA. Rubber and PLA may exist as separate dispersed phases in polypropylene matrix. However, when PLAand functional polyolefins such as epoxy-functional polypropylene (labeled as A) made at Total Petrochemicals or epoxy-functionalized polyethylene supplied by Arkema such as Lotader AX8400 (labeled as B) were premixed before compounding with polypropylene, PLA phases can be encapsulated inside rubber phases in polypropylene matrix (see FIG. 1). FIG. 1 depicts a blend of LX3 12-04/20% Tafiner/10% PLA with separate rubber and PLA dispersed phases (left), and with PLA phases encapsulated inside rubber phases (right). The advantages of the controlled phase morphology may include superior stiffness balance especially for injection molding formulations with lower rubber contents, as well as increase efficiency of rubber use for polypropylene modifications, just to name a few. The materials with these controlled morphology exhibit good mechanical properties especially tensile properties with significantly high elongation at break (FIG. 2 and FIG. 3). FIG. 2 depicts notched Izod (foot.pound/inch, as determined by ASTM D-256A) versus flexural modulus (as measured by ASTM D-790). FIG. 3 is a tensile test (as measured by ASTM D-638) Example 2 The melt pressures of PP/PLA blends made with and without a cavitating booster were investigated. Sample 1 was prepared by blending Total Petrochemicals polypropylene 3271 with 10% PLA 6201D (previously dried at 75° C. for 6 hours under vacuum prior to extrusion). Sample 2 was prepared by blending 3271, 10% PLA 6201, and 5% POLYBOND 3002 containing 0.6% maleic anhydride (MAH) grafted onto polypropylene (maleated polypropylene). The blended mixtures were extruded in a 27 mm co-rotating twin screw extruder. The screw speed of the extruder was set at 100 rpm and the output rate was at 15 lbs/hr. Devol ports were vacuumed to remove any volatiles generated during extrusion The melt pressure data as a function of extrusion time is shown in FIG. 4. Referring to FIG. 4, Sample 2 (containing the cavitating agent) had a higher melt pressure at earlier extrusion times. Later times show that the melt pressure of Sample 2 had stabilized resulting in the final melt pressures of the samples being similar. Extruded pellets of both samples were compression molded and subsequently characterized for the extent of phase dispersion of PLA in the PP via Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). AFM images of both samples are shown in FIG. 5. Referring to FIG. 5, both samples are shown form immiscible blends wherein the PLA, appearing as circular bodies 110, is dispersed in a polypropylene continuous phase, 120. In Sample 1, PLA was seen to form bodies of various sizes within PP with some of the bodies having sizes larger than 5 micrometer (μm). In comparison Sample 2, prepared with a cavitating booster, displays a similar amount of PLA 110 dispersed within the PP. Without wishing to be limited by theory, the cavitating booster, maleated polypropylene, may introduce some polar interactions and H-bonding between PP and PLA phases and may help PLA dispersion to a certain degree.
