FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to methods to produce material patterns for costumes, festive characters and other pattern assembled costume creative objects. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION For special occasions and activities many people like to put on special costumes, create festive character outfits and/or assemble fanciful objects. At sports events many people like to dress up in crazy outfits and paint themselves in multiple colors. Many people like to make their costumes or like to make accessory object items that may stand alone or might go with their special occasion garb. Buying and or making a special occasion costume may be expensive or very time consuming to make from scratch. What is needed is where a selection of costume outfits, characters or festive items could be made by a producer and the expense may be lessened by the individual possibly assembling the festive outfit, costume character or creative object. It would also be beneficial to those individuals to have some selected or designed input into the look of the festive outfit or item.

The costume wear, character or item, Costume, producer, Producer, has various Costume pattern selections for the customer to chose from a list or catalogue, usually offered online, where the Costume selections may be a fictional character, sports outfits or character, and/or other fun or festive costume wear, character or creative item. The Costume selections are printed patterns offered by the Producer that are assembled and fastened together either by the producer, a third party or by the customer. The customer may be able to choose from the Producer's list of Costume pattern options that may include size, color, shapes and other available Producer options. A digital programmable printer prints the Costume patterns on the Costume print stock, which is usually a foam material. Once the Costume patterns are printed a digital cutter cuts around the circumference of the patterns where printed material cuts are needed but intermittent uncut or partial depth cut sections are left to allow the pattern to not separated from the print material sheet. The printed/cut Costume pattern sheet material can then be rolled folded or stacked for shipment to the customer. When the customer receives the print/cut Costume sheet material the patterns can be cut loose with scissors, knife or other cutting instrument and the printer marked attaching seams of the patterns can be fastened together, usually with sticking tape, Velcro style fasteners or other fastening means. A further embodiment of the invention is where the customer can customize certain sections of the costume/character with the customer's own digital images, numbers, color scheme and/or shapes. The producer's programmable printer can input the communicated customer's customization images into the pattern's printing process.
