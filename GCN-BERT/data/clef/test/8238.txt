Step 3. Preparation of 8-Chloro-3-hydroxymethyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-(1H)-one
Ethyl 8-chloro-4-oxo-2-phenyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-formate (16.4g, 0.05mol) and 100ml THF were added to a 250ml three-necked flask, stirred to be dissolved and cooled to -20°C. Lithium aluminum hydride (3.8g, 0.1mol) was added in portions and there were bubbles coming out. The speed was controlled, the temperature was maintained below or equal to 0°C, and the adding was completed in about 15min. The temperature was raised to room temperature and stirring was carried out for 2h. TLC tracking was performed until the completion of the reaction. After the reaction was stopped, 3.8g sodium sulfate decahydrate was added in portions and there were bubbles coming out. The adding speed was controlled to avoid washing away the materials. After adding, reaction was carried out at room temperature with stirring for 0.5h. Suction filtration was performed, solid was washed with tetrahydrofuran 3 times, solvent was removed and spin drying was performed to give 12.7g of a solid with a yield of 88.6%.
