LACTIDE POLYMERISATION The present invention relates to the production of po!y(lactic acids), it, further, relates to metal complexes that are useful as catalysts/initiators in lactide polymerisation. Poly(factic acids) (PLAs) have been studied intensely during the past few decades because of their biodegradabiliiy and biocompatibiitty. PLA possesses versatile physical properties and has been used in medical applications and tissue engineering such as media for controlled drug release. Ring opening polymerisation (ROP) of lactide (LA) by single-site initiators is the most efficient route to PLAs with controlled molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution. The two stereogenic centres in one lactide molecule results in three distinct configurational isomers (5, S)-LA, (L-LA); {R,R)~LA, (D-LA) and (R,S)-LA, (meso)-LA. The 1 :1 mixture of (S,S)-LA and (RR)-LA is referred to as rac-LA. Metal complexes useful for initiating ring opening polymerisation of lactides are known. Wenshan Ren et al, Inorganic Chemistry Communications, 30, (2013), 26-28 report that benzyl thorium metallocenes [η5-1 ,3-(Me3C)2C5H3]2 Th(CH2Ph)2 (1 ) and [t -1 ,2,4-(Me3C)3C5H2]2 Th(CH2Ph)2 (2) can initiate the ring opening polymerisation (ROP) of racemic-!actide (rac-LA) under mild conditions. Complete conversion of 500 equiv of lactide occurs within 5h at 40°C in dichloromethane at [rac-LA]=1 .0 moi L"1 , and the molecular weight distribution is very narrow (ca.1 .15) over the entire monomer-to-initiator range, indicating a single-site catalyst system. Yalan Ning et al, Organometallics 2008, 27, 5632-5640 report four neutral zirconocene bis(ester enolate) and non-zirconocene bis(alkoxy) complexes employed for ring-opening polymerisations and chain transfer polymerisations of L-Iactide (L-LA) and ε-caprolactone (ε-CL).

EXPERIMENTAL DETAIL I - relating to permethylpentalenes General Procedure Ail organometallic syntheses were performed under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen gas, utilizing standard Schlenk techniques on a dual vacuum-inlet gas manifold or Braun glove box. Where necessary, solvents were dried SPS drying system (hexane, pentane, toluene). Deuterated NMR solvents were dried over NaK (benzene-d6, toluene-d8) or CaH2 (chloroform-d-i), vacuum transferred and free-pump-thaw-degassed three times prior to use. Elemental analyses were conducted by Mr Stephen Boyer at the elemental analysts service at London Metropolitan University. NMR spectra were recorded using Young's tap NMR tubes on a Varian Mercury VX-Works 300 MHz spectrometer. Ή and l C{!H} NMR spectra were referenced via the residual protio-solvent peak. Potassium ferf-butoxide was purchased from Sigma- Aldrich and used as received. L- and rac- lactide were purchased from Alfa Aesar and re-crystallized and sublimed {10-2 mbar, 50°C) prior to use. [K(O- 2,6-Me-C6H3)] and [K(0-2,4-'Bu-C6H3)] were prepared by stirring potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide with the appropriate alcohol in THF at room temperature. X-ray crystallography Crystals were mounted on glass fibres using perfluoropolyether oil, transferred to a goniometer head on the diffractometer and cooled rapidly to 150K in a stream of cold nitrogen using an Oxford Cryosystems CRYOSTREAM unit. Data collections were performed using an Enraf-Nonium FR590 KappaCCD diffractometer, utilising graphite-monochromated Mo Κα X- ray radiation (λ = 0.71073 A). Intensity data were processed using the DENZO-SMN package. Structures were solved using the direct-methods program SIR92, and refined using full-matrix least squares refinement on all F2 data using the CRYSTALS program suite. Polymerisation procedure All polymerizations were carried out in Young's tap NMR tubes containing 0.4 mL of a benzene-d6 solution of lactide with an initial lactide concentration of [LA]o = 0.104 M and 0.1 mL of a benzene-d6 solution of catalyst (of a concentration to ensure [LA]0/[init.]0 = 50). Lactide conversion was subsequently caiculated by comparing the integration values of the methane signal of PLA and iactide monomer in the ]H NMR spectrum. The temperature at which a given poiymerisation was carried out varied in the temperature range 80 to 100°C and is noted in the appropriate section.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAIL II - relating to (hydro)permethylpentalenes General procedure All organometaflic syntheses were performed under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen gas, utilizing standard Sch!enk techniques on a dual vacuum-inlet gas manifold or Braun glove box. Where necessary, solvents were dried by reflux over the appropriate drying agent NaK (Et20), sodium (THF) and SPS drying system (hexane, pentane, soluene). Solvents were distilled from the desiccant under a flowing stream of nitrogen and transferred using a siphoning technique via steel cannulae and stored in flame-dried glass ampoules under an atmosphere of nitrogen. Deuterated NMR solvents were dried over NaK (benzene-cfe. toluene-d8) or CaH2 (pyridine-cfs), vacuum transferred and freeze-pump-thaw-degassed three times prior to use. Elemental analyses were conducted by Mr Stephen Boyer at the elemental analysis service at London Metropolitan University. NMR spectra were recorded using Young's tap NMR tubes on a Varian Mercury VX-Works 300 MHz spectrometer. Ή and l C{sH} NMR spectra were referenced to the residual protio-solvent peak. X-ray crystallography Crystafs were mounted on glass fibres using perfluoropolyether oil, transferred to a goniometer head on the diffractometer and cooled rapidly to 150 K in a stream of cold nitrogen using an Oxford Cryosystems CRYOSTREAM unit. Data collections were performed using an Enraf-Nonius FR590 KappaCCD diffractometer, utilising graphite-monochromated Mo Κα X- ray radiation (λ = 0.71073 A), intensity data were processed using the DENZO-SMN package. Structures were solved using the direct-methods program SIR92, and refined using full-matrix least squares refinement on all F2 data using the CRYSTALS program suite. Polymerisation procedure The lactide monomer (40 mg) and the complex were introduced in an NMR tube following the desired monomeninitiator ratio. Then 0.57 mL of chloroform-di was added to the compounds, leading to an initial monomer concentration of [LA]o = 0.5 M. The solution was monitored by !H NMR spectroscopy. The conversion was determined by integration of the methane area of the polymer versus the monomer. EXAMPLE 8 Synthesis of Pn*(H)SnMe3. To a slurry of Pn*(H)Li (2.09 g, 10.7 mmol) in pentane (20 mL) at -78°C was added a solution of SnMe3CI (2.14 g, 10.7 mmol) in pentane (10 mL).

EXPERIMENTAL DETAIL III - relating to indenyi-base catalysts General Details Air and moisture sensitive compounds were manipulated under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen, using standard Schienk line techniques on a dual manifold vacuum/nitrogen line or a Braun Unilab glove box. Reaction solvents (pentane, hexane, and toluene) were dried using an MBraun SPS- 800 solvent purification system. Hexane, toluene, and pentane were stored over pre-activated 3 A molecular sieves. Dry solvents were stored in oven- dried ampoules under an atmosphere of nitrogen, sealed with either Rotoflo or Young's taps. Deuterated solvents used in NMR analysis of air-sensitive compounds were dried over the appropriate drying agent, freeze-thaw degassed and vacuum transferred prior to use: chloroform-οΊ (Sigma-Aidrich) was stored over pre-activated 3 A molecular sieves. NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 MHz Varian Mercury VX-Works spectrometer. Ή (300.27 MHz) and 13C{!H} (75.50 MHz) spectra were recorded at 25°C unless otherwise stated, and referenced internally to the residual protio-solvent peak in the deuterated solvent used. Ή and C{'H} chemical shifts, δ, are given in parts per million (ppm), are given relative to the residual solvent peaks. Air sensitive samples were prepared under an inert atmosphere in a glove box, using dried solvents in Young's taps NMR tubes. [(ind)2ZrMe2], and complex were synthesised according to literature procedures. [(EBI)ZrCI2] (Strem Chemicals) was hot re-crystallised in toluene. Polymerisation procedure All polymerisations were carried out in Young's tap NMR tubes containing 40 mg of Iactide in a chloroform-οΊ solution of initiator (20 mg initiator in 4 mL chloroform- i), ensuring that the Iactide : initiator ratio was 50 : 1. ch!oroform- di was then added to ensure the initial Iactide concentration was [LA]0 = 0.50 M. Polymerisations involving addition ferf-butanol were prepared as usual, and ferf-butanol was added to the chioroform-d-i solution via microsyringe, ensuring the iactide : initiator : ie/ -butanol ratio was 50 : 1 : 1. X-ray crystallography Crystals were mounted on MiTeGen MicroMants using perfluoropolyether oil, and cooled rapidly to 150 K in a stream of cold nitrogen using an Oxford Cryosystems CRYOSTREAM unit. Data collections were performed using an Enraf-Nonius FR590 KappaCCD diffractometer, utilising graphife- monochromated Mo Ka X-ray radiation (λ = 0.71073 A). Raw frame data were collected at 150(2) K using a Nonius KappaCCD diffractometer, reduced using DENZO-SMN and corrected for absorption using SORTAV. The structure was solved using SuperFlip and refined using full matrix least- squares using CRYSTALS.

Polymerisation conditions:chloroform-di at 100°C with [LA]o/[M]o = 50, [LA)o = 0.5 . As can be seen in Figure 1 , the four complexes based on dimethyl and diisopropyl aromatic group with zirconium and hafnium (7, 8, 10 and 11 ) led to the highest constant of propagation (0.364 < /ί0&3<0.479 h_1).Both ferf-butyl complexes (9 and 12) demonstrated the lowest rate of polymerisation (with /fobs of 0.043 h'1 for n5-Pn*(H)ZrCI2(0-2,6-¾u-C6H3) and kobs of 0.086 h"1 for r - Pn*(H)HfCI2(0-2,6-(Bu-C6H3)). When varying the metal using dimethylphenoxide type complexes, it appears that zirconium is faster than hafnium than titanium (koi}S of 0.479, 0.391 and 0.1 13 h"1 respectively). These rates are within the literature range. The poiydispersities are relatively high (1 .45 < Mw/ n < 1.74) certainly due to high temperature of polymerisation. The molecular weights are slightly higher than the theoretical ones (7,547 < Mn < ,680 g/mol). The effect of variation of the alkoxide group substituent on the polymerisation of L-!actide has been studied at 100°C, with a monomer:initiator: ratio of 50 in chforoform-cfi. When complexes n,5-Pn*(H)Ti(0'Bu)3, 1 , and if- Pn*(H)Zr(0'Bu)3 3, were used no conversion was achieved after 1 h. However, changing the ferf-butyi group for a benzylic type substituent dramatically increased the rate of the polymerisation with conversion above 90% for n5-Pn*(H)Ti(0-CH2Ph)3l 4, n5-Pn*(H)Zr(0-S-CH{CH3}C6H5)3, 5, ry- Pn*(H)Zr(0-rac-CH{CH3}C6H5)3, 6, (93, 96 and 97% respectively). To study the effect of the chiraiity on the initiating group, pseudo-first order kinetic data of the polymerisation of lactide monomers were carried out with a monomer: initiator; ratio of 50 at 100°C in chloroform-^ . The results are shown in Table 2 and illustrated in Figures 2-3 and SI.

Both complexes n5-Pn*(H}Zr(0-S-CH{CH3}CeH5)3! 5, n5-Pn*(H)Zr(0-rac- CH{CH3}C6H5)3l 6 demonstrated very high rate of polymerisation for L- and rac-lactide (1.885 < kobs < 3.442 h"') at 100°C. Over the three temperatures (60, 80 and 100°C), the racemic complex polymerised faster both lactide monomers. At 60°C, the observed propagation rates when using rac-η5- Pn*(H)Zr(0-CH{CH3}C6H5)3, 6 are around 70% faster (/ obs of 0.850 h ! for L- lactide and 0.767 A for rac-lactide) than when i -Pn*(H)Zr(O-S- CH{CH3}C6H5)3 5 was used (kobs of 0.484 h"[ for L-iactide and 0.491 h"1 for rac-lactide). L- and rac-lactide appears to be polymerised at similar rates of polymerisation. The polydispersfties decreased with decreasing temperature (1.27 < w/ n < 1 .44 for 100°C and 1.15 < M Mn < 1 .24 for 80°C). The molecular weight experimental are half of the theoretical (2,693 < n < 4,549 g/mol). The activation parameters for the ring-opening polymerisation of L- and rac- lactide initiated using n5-Pn*(H)Zr{O-S-CH{CH3}C6H5)3, 5, qs-Pn*(H)Zr(0-rac- CH{CH3}C6H5)3l 6 were determined using Eyring plots and found to be 30.4 < ΔΗ* < 46.6 kJ/mol and 41 1.4 < Δ$# < 640 J/{mol K), Figure 4 and SI. Figure 4 is an Eyring plot of L-!actide polymerisation using n5-Pn*(H)Zr(0-S- CH{CH3}C6H5)3l 5. Slope = -5610±488 with R2 = 0.993.

The results are collated in Table 3 and illustrated Figure 5. Table 3. L-lactide polymerisation: Variation of the concentration Figure 5 shows L-iactide polymerisation using n5-Pn*(H)Zr(U-2,6-Pr-C6H3)3, 8: [LA3o/tZr]o - 25 (black square, kQbs = 0.521±0.021 h"1); [LA]0/[Zr]0 = 50 {red circle, /cobs = 0.39H0.022 h"1); [LA]o/[Zr]0 = 100 (blue triangle, kobs - 0.377±0.015 ); [LA]0/[Zr]0 = 200 (pink triangle, / obs = 0.235±0.004 h'1). Poiymerisation conditions:chloroform-di at 100°C with [LA]o = 0.5 . As expected the rate of the polymerisations of L-lactide at 100°C in chloroform-οΊ increased with decreasing monomer:initiator ratio (kobs of 0.235, 0.377, 0.391 and 0.521 h_s for [LA]0/[Zr]o of 200, 100, 50 and 25 respectively). Furthermore, the molecular weights, n, increased with increasing concentration from 6,920 to 17,042 g/mol for initial monomeninitiator ratio of 25 to 200 respectively. The polydtspersities, M Mn, are varying between .40 < Mw/Mn < 1 .74. The observed rate of the propagation of L-lactide using n5-Pn*(H)Zr(0-2,6-Pr- CeH3)3, 8, demonstrated a pseudo first-order kinetic as a function of the initiator (Figure 6). Figure 6 shows a plot of Ln(/iobs) vs Ln([ZR]0) using q5-Pn*(H)Zr(0-2,6-Pr- C6H3)3, 8. Slope = 0.350±82 with R2 = 0.901. Polymerisation conditions: chloroform-οΊ at 100°C and [LA]0 = 0.5 M.

The results are collated in Table 4 and illustrated Figure 7. Table 4. L-lactide polymerisation: Variation of the temperature Polymerisation conditions: [LA]0/[M]0 = 50, [LA]0 = 0.5 M, chloroform-d-i. Figure 7 shows L-lactide polymerisation using r -Pn*(H)Zr(0-2,6-Pr-C6H3)3, 8: T = 00°C (black square, kobs - 0.391 ±0.022 h"1); T - 90°C (red circle, / obs = 0.151 ±0.008 h"1); T = 80°C (blue triangle, kobs - 0.092±0.006 h"!). Polymerisation conditions: chloroform-οΊ with [LA]0/[ ]0 = 50, [LAj0 - 0.5 M. As expected the rate of the polymerisations of L-!actide in chloroform-o'i decreased with decreasing temperature (/c0bs of 0.391 , 0.151 and 0.092 h"s for T of 100, 90 and 80 respectively). The molecular weights, n, remain constant between 6,348 to 7,751 g/mol which are very close to the theoretical ones. However, the polydispersities, M Mn, decreased with decreasing temperature from 1.72 to 1.58 for 100 to 80°C respectively. The activation parameters for the ring-opening polymerisation of L- initiated using r|5-Pn*(H)Zr(0-2,6-Pr-C6H3)3, 8 were determined using Eyring plots and found to be ΔΗ* = 75.9 kJ/mol and Δ5# = 1847 J/(mot K), Figure 8. Figure 8 shows an Eyring plot of L-lactide polymerisation using η5- Pn*(H)Zr(0-216-Pr2C6H3)3, 8. Slope = -9133±1881 with Rl = 0.959. Polymerisation conditions: chioroform-οΊ with [LA]0/[Zr]0 = 50 and [LA]Q = 0.5 . The synthesized polylactides were characterised by Ή, 'Ή^Η} and 1 C{'H} NM spectroscopy. The NMR spectra demonstrated no epimerisation when L-lactide was polymerised and an isotactic biased PLA when rac-lactide was polymerised. They have also been characterised by MALDI-TOF and C{!H} NMR spectroscopy to determine the end of chains. It was shown that the lactide monomers inserted in the metal-oxygen bond. (I I) Pseudo-first order kinetic data of the polymerisation of L-lactide at 80°C in beneze-cfe, with an initiatonmonomer ratio of 1 :50, using selected permethylpenialene complexes are shown in Figure 9. The kinetic data for all polymerisations displayed an induction period that varied depending on the initiating complex. As such, the data in Figure 9 is given from 32 h, by which time all induction periods had ended. The complex that exhibited by far the highest activity towards the ring-opening polymerisation of lactide isomers was [η8-(Ρη*)Τί(Ο-2,6-Μβ-06Η3)2]· It demonstrates a rate of polymerisation similar to published titanium complexes (/fobs = 69.9 x 10"3 '1†1 and ten times faster than the complexes [r|s-(Pn*)Ti(0- 2,6-Me-C6H3)CS] and [n8-(Pn*)Ti(0-2,4-Bu-C6H3)CI] at 80°C which demonstrated similar rates of propagation, (kGbs ~ 7.2 x 10"3 h"1 and 7.0 x 10"3 h"1 respectively). These rates of propagation being 3.5 times faster than when [n5-(Pn*)Ti(0-2,6-Me-C6H3)CI2] was used (kobs - 1 .9 x 10"3 h'1). Figure 9 shows semi-logarithmic plots of L-lactide conversion vs time, [LA]0/[lnit]o = 50, [LA]0 = 0.104 M, T = 80°C, benzene-cfe (0.5 mL), using [η8- (Pn*)Ti(0-2,6-Me-C6H3)CI], (green dotted line), in8-(Pn*)Ti(0-2!4-'Bu-C6H3)C1]i (black dashed line) [η8-(Ρη*)Τ!(Ο-2,6-Μβ-06Η3)2] (red line) and [r -(Pn*H)Ts(0- 2,6-Me-C6Ha)Cl2] (blue dot-dashed line). Induction period omitted. As is shown in Figure 10, at 90°C, when initiated by [i -(Pn*)Ti(0-2,6- e- C6H3)2], rac- and L-iactide polymerise at the same rate ( bs ~ 110 x 10'3 h"1). This is presumably because the achirai initiator cannot distinguish between both Iactide enantiomers and has incorporated each at the same rate. This absence of stereochemical preference suggests that the polymerisation goes by a chain-end controlled mechanism. Figure 10 shows semi-logarithmic plots of Iactide monomers conversion vs time. Induction period omitted. [LA]0 = 0.104 M, [LA]0/[lnit]0 = 50, T = 90°C, benzene-cfe. Polymerisation using [r)8-(Pn*)Ti(0-2,6-Me-C6H3)2], L-lactide (red line) and rac-lactide (black dashed line). Polymerisations of L-!actide using [niJ-(Pn*)Ti(0-2,6- e-C6H3)2] were carried out in the temperature range of 80 to 100°C and the results were collated to an Eyring plot. From the Eyring plot an estimation of the activation parameters were obtained: ΔΗ* = 75.15 kJ mol"1, Δ8# = -125.85 J K"1 mol"1 , AG (100°C) = 87.74 kJ moP. The modest value of ΔΗΓ is typical for attack on a carbonyl group coordinated to a metal centre and the negative and relatively high value of AS implies a high degree of order in the transition state. As such, all parameters are consistent with a coordination insertion mechanism displaying a highly ordered transition state. The polymerisation of L-lactide leads to isotactic PLA and rac-lactide to atactic PLA. (Ill) Pseudo-first order kinetic data of the polymerisation of L-lactide using [(EBl)Zr(0-2,6-Me-C6H3)Ci], [0nd)2Zr(O'Bu)Me]r and [(lnd)2Zr(0-2,6-Me- CeH3)Me] are shown in Figure 11. All initial polymerisation studies were carried out at 80°C in chloroform-c/i, with an L-LA : initiator ratio of 50:1 , ensuring [LA]0 - 0.50 M. Figure 12 shows semi-logarithmic plots of L-lactide conversion vs time, [LA]0/[lnit]o = 50, [LA]0 = 0.50 M, T = 80°C, ch!oroform-d1 (0.5 mL), po!ymerisation using [(EBI)Zr(0-2,6-Me-C6H3)CI], (doited line), [(lnd)2Zr(0'Bu)Me], (solid line), [(lnd)2Zr(0-2,6-Me-C6H3)Me], (dashed line). Figure 12 shows that complex [(lnd)2Zr(0'Bu)Me] displayed the highest activity with 84% conversion in eight hours (kobs = 0.24 h"1) and no initiation period. This is comparable to moderate activities of zirconium initiators in the literature. A significantly lower activity was displayed by [{lnd)2Zr(0-2,6-Me- C6H3)Me] which achieved 74% conversion after 28 h ( obs = 0,05 h"1), at a rate 4.5 times slower than i(lnd)2Zr(0¾u)Me]. Interestingly, [(lnd)2Zr(0-2,6-Me- C6H3)lvle] displayed an initiation period of around half an hour. These observations are rationalised by the increased bulk of the aryl-oxide substituent of [(lnd)2Zr(0-2,6-Me-C6H3 e] compared to the te/f-butoxide substituent of [(lnd)2Zr(0'Bu)Me]. In comparison, [(EBI)Zr(0-2,6-Me-C6H3)CI] exhibited the lowest catalytic activity, managing 4.2% conversion in 28 h (kobs = 0.002 h"1) which is comparable to rac-[(EBl)Zr(OC{OiPr}=C e2)] (7% conversion in 18 h at 80°C in toluene) synthesised by Ning er a/, Organometaliics, 2008, 27, 5632. The rate of [(EBl)Zr(0~2,6-Me-C6H3)CI] is two orders of magnitude less than [(lnd)2Zr(0'Bu)Me] and [(lnd)2Zr(0-2,6-Me- C6H3)Me], probably due to both the increased bulk of the aryloxide compared to the fe -butoxide and the increased rigidity conferred by the ansa-bridged ligand, preventing reorientation of the indenyl moieties. As [(lnd)2Zr(0'Bu)lvle] showed the highest rate of polymerisation, further studies were carried out to investigate its stereoselectivity and estimate its activation. Polymerisations using [(lnd)2Zr((_ Bu)Me] as the initiator were carried out between 60°C and 100°C, with the same LA : initiator ratios and [LA]o as used previously. The enthalpy of activation (ΔΗ*) and the entropy of activation (AS*) were calculated from a plot of ln(/ ote/T) vs. (1/T) (Fig.12), giving ΔΗί = 46,9 kJ.mol'1 and AS* = -193.9 J.K^ .mot1. These values are consistent with the literature; typical for a bimolecular reaction, and a coordination-insertion mechanism. Furthermore, it was found that polymerisation of L-LA (kobs = 0.24 h"1) was twice as fast as rac-LA (kobs = 0.1 1 h"1) with [(lnd)2Zr(0''Bu)Me] at 80°C with similar [LA]Q:[2]0 ratio of 50: 1 (Fig.13). This is probably due to the energy barrier required to invert the chiral configuration at the metal centre, which is indicative of a chain-end control mechanism. The 1H{1 H} NMR spectrum of the polymerisation of rac-LA using [(lnd)2Zr(0'Bu)Me] as initiator demonstrated a bias towards isotactic PLA, P, of 72%. Polymerisations of L-LA and rac-LA were repeated at 80°C with the addition of ferf-butano! in stoichiometric amounts with [(lnd)2Zr(0'Bu)Me]. The addition of fe f-butanol has little effect on kobs for both L-LA and rac-LA. The rate of polymerisation for L-LA without alcohol is similar to the one with ( bs of 0.24 h"1 and 0.23 h"1 respectively). Similarly the rates for the polymerisations of rac-LA were (kobs of 0.1 1 h'1 and 0. 0 h"s respectively). The molecular weights and polydispersities of the polymerisation of L-LA and rac-LA with and without ieri-butanol are collated in Table 5. As an initiator, [(lnd)2Zr(0'Bu)Me] demonstrated highly controlled polymerisation of L-LA and rac-LA at 80°C with a LA : initiator ratio of 50 : 1 in chloroform-οΊ , as shown by low polydispersities (1 .08 < M Mn < 1.12). The addition of terf-butanol does not affect the polydispersities; however, the experimental molecular weights appear more controlled in the presence of the alcohol, as expected of immortal polymerisation.
