CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of and incorporates by reference co-pending U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/994,183 filed May 16, 2014. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to toilet attachments and, more particularly, to a child's potty seat which is configured with handles and attaches to a public toilet. 2. Description of the Prior Art For parents of children who are potty training, the concern that their child may fall in a standard toilet while using it is frequently a major concern. In addition, when in public places, parents are often presented with the undesirable option of having their young child use a toilet whose seats has been soiled from previous use or is otherwise in an unsanitary condition. A problem which still exists, therefore, is that the use of standard toilets by young children can be dangerous and expose the child to filthy conditions. Thus, there remains a need for a handled potty seat which can be placed over a standard toilet seat to form a seat sized for a young child. It would be helpful if such a handled potty seat was portable to enable it to be selectively deployed when needed in a public bathroom. It would be additionally desirable for the handles of such a handled potty seat to provide a place for a child to hold to give a more independent feel. The Applicant's invention described herein provides for a handled potty seat apparatus adapted to provide a structure which assists small children in using a standard toilet. The primary aspects in Applicant's handled potty seat are a seat portion, handle portions, and an attachment portion. When in operation, the handled potty seat enables young children to use a standard size toilet without the risk of falling in or off and without having to contact the toilet. As a result, many of the limitations imposed by prior art structures are removed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A handled potty seat for use with a conventional toiler set that provides a structure for smaller users to sit on the toilet without falling in. The handled potty seat is defined by a potty seat portion shaped in a conventionally but sized to provide a narrowed opening over the toilet, two side handles which extend from opposing sides of the potty seat, and an attachment portion for anchoring the handled potty seat behind and under the back side of the toilet. The attachment portion includes a flexible elbow portion which enables the potty seat to be moved between an up position in which it is perpendicular to a toilet seat in place on a toilet rim and a down position in which it lies flat on the toilet seat. It is an object of this invention to provide a handled potty seat which can be placed over a standard toilet seat to form a seat sized for a young child. It is another object of this invention to provide a handled potty seat which was portable so as to enable it to be selectively deployed when needed in a public bathroom. It is yet another object of this invention to provide a handled potty seat that provides a place for a child to hold to give a more independent feel. These and other objects will be apparent to one of skill in the art. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a top plan view of a handled potty seat built in accordance with the present invention in the up position on a toilet seat. FIG. 2 is a top plan view of a handled potty seat built in accordance with the present invention in the down position on a toilet seat. FIG. 3 is a side elevational view of a handled potty seat built in accordance with the present invention in the down position. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring now to the drawings and in particular FIGS. 1 and 2 a handled potty seat 100 is defined by a potty seat portion 110, two handles 120, and an attachment portion. The potty seat portion 110 is shaped as a conventional toilet seat 130, yet sized more narrowly to enable a child to sit thereon without the risk of falling through. A handle 120 is disposed on each side of the potty seat portion 110. Together, the handles 120 enable a user to grasp the handled potty seat 100 on each side, making it easier to balance while on top of a handled potty seat 100 in place on a toilet seat 130. The attachment portion, defined by a retaining hook area 131, a flexible elbow portion 132, and a platform ledge 133, enables the handled potty seat 100 to be secured to the toilet seat 130. The retaining hook area 131 is structured to slide behind and under the back side of the toilet seat 130. The flexible elbow portion 132, defined in one embodiment as a hinge, enables the potty seat portion 110 to be moved between an up position, as shown in FIG. 1, and a down position as shown in FIG. 2. It is contemplated that the potty seat portion 110 is placed in the up position to be secured to and removed from the toilet seat 130, and placed in the down position to be used. The handles 120, along with the platform ledge 133, allow the handled potty seat 100 to rest on the toilet seat 130 once it has been placed thereon. Together, they enable the handled potty seat 100 to distribute weight on the handled potty seat 100 over three distinct points. The instant invention has been shown and described herein in what is considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment. It is recognized, however, that departures may be made therefrom within the scope of the invention and that obvious modifications will occur to a person skilled in the art. 1.
