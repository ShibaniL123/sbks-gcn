Preparation of a diastereoisomeric mixture of (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
Sodium nitrite (33.6 mg, 0.49 mmol) as a solution in water (0.400 mL) was added dropwise to a cooled solution of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-2-(3-((tert-butyldiphenyl silyl)oxy)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (339 mg, 0.49 mmol) in propionic acid (4 mL) at −20° C., and the reaction was stirred for 30 minutes under these conditions. Ice-cold EtOAc (20 mL) was added followed by portion-wise addition of saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (5 mL). The biphasic mixture was stirred vigorously and neutralized by slow addition of solid Na2CO3. The phases were separated, and the organic layers were washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (2×30 mL) and saturated aqueous NaCl (30 mL) before being dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 40% EtOAc in hexanes, to afford (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (206 mg, 60%) as a pale yellow solid.
