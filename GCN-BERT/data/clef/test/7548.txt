CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to Provisional Patent Application U.S. Ser. No. 61/925,405 filed Jan. 9, 2014, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The disclosure generally relates to compounds of formula I, including their salts, as well as compositions and methods of using the compounds. The compounds are ligands for the NR2B NMDA receptor and may be useful for the treatment of various disorders of the central nervous system. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ion channels which are gated by the binding of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. They are thought to play a key role in the development of a number of neurological diseases, including depression, neuropathic pain, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. Functional NMDA receptors are tetrameric structures primarily composed of two NR1 and two NR2 subunits. The NR2 subunit is further subdivided into four individual subtypes: NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, and NR2D, which are differentially distributed throughout the brain. Antagonists or allosteric modulators of NMDA receptors, in particular NR2B subunit-containing channels, have been investigated as therapeutic agents for the treatment of major depressive disorder (G. Sanacora, 2008, Nature Rev. Drug Disc. 7: 426-437). The NR2B receptor contains additional ligand binding sites in addition to that for glutamate. Non-selective NMDA antagonists such as Ketamine are pore blockers, interfering with the transport of Ca++ through the channel. Ketamine has demonstrated rapid and enduring antidepressant properties in human clinical trials as an i.v. drug. Additionally, efficacy was maintained with repeated, intermittent infusions of Ketamine (Zarate et al., 2006, Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 63: 856-864). This class of drugs, though, has limited therapeutic value because of its CNS side effects, including dissociative effects. An allosteric, non-competitive binding site has also been identified in the N-terminal domain of NR2B. Agents which bind selectively at this site, such as Traxoprodil, exhibited a sustained antidepressant response and improved side effect profile in human clinical trials as an i.v. drug (Preskorn et al., 2008, J. Clin. Psychopharmacol., 28: 631-637, and F. S. Menniti, et al., 1998, CNS Drug Reviews, 4, 4, 307-322). However, development of drugs from this class has been hindered by low bioavailability, poor pharmacokinetics, and lack of selectivity against other pharmacological targets including the hERG ion channel. Blockade of the hERG ion channel can lead to cardiac arrythmias, including the potentially fatal Torsades de pointe, thus selectivity against this channel is critical. Thus, in the treatment of major depressive disorder, there remains an unmet clinical need for the development of effective NR2B-selective negative allosteric modulators which have a favorable tolerability profile. NR2B receptor antagonists have been disclosed in PCT publication WO 2009/006437. The invention provides technical advantages, for example, the compounds are novel and are ligands for the NR2B receptor and may be useful for the treatment of various disorders of the central nervous system. Additionally, the compounds provide advantages for pharmaceutical uses, for example, with regard to one or more of their mechanism of action, binding, inhibition efficacy, target selectivity, solubility, safety profiles, or bioavailability.

Another aspect of the invention is a compound of the formula where R is a prodrug moiety selected from the group consisting of alkyl esters, amino acid esters, alkoxy esters, phosphonic acids, phosphonic alkyl esters, alkoxyphosphononate acid, alkoxyphosphonate alkyl esters, alkyl carabamates, amino acid carbamates, alkyl phosporamidates, aryl phosphoramidates, and sulfamates; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Synthetic Methods Compounds of Formula I may be made by methods known in the art including those described below and including variations within the skill of the art. Some reagents and intermediates are known in the art. Other reagents and intermediates can be made by methods known in the art using readily available materials. The variables (e.g. numbered “R” substituents) used to describe the synthesis of the compounds are intended only to illustrate how to make the compounds and are not to be confused with variables used in the claims or in other sections of the specification. The following methods are for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. The schemes encompass reasonable variations known in the art. Scheme 1 shows an effective synthesis of example 1, (R)-3-((3S,4S)-3-fluoro-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)piperidin-1-yl)-1-(4-methylbenzyl)pyrrolidin-2-one. Hydroxylactam 1 is available commercially in optically pure form. It can be protected and N-alkylated to form lactam 4. Deprotection and activation of the hydroxyl group with methanesulfonylchloride leads to the lactam 5. Separately, compound 6 can be prepared by the Suzuki coupling reaction between commercial 4-benzyloxybromobenzene and commercial tert-butyl 4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-5,6-dihydropyridine-1(2H)-carboxylate. Treatment of 6 with in-situ prepared borane followed by oxidation results in formation of the trans racemic alcohol 7. The alcohol 7 can be separated in to the individual enantiomers, and the phenol can be unmasked using hydrogenation under standard conditions to the prepare the substituted phenol 8. Fluorination with de-oxofluor reagent provides selectively the trans aryl fluoride 9, and deprotection of the Boc group with hydrochloric acid provides the piperidine as the hydrochloride salt. Simple extraction under basic conditions provides the piperidine 10 as the freebase. Careful reaction of the piperidine 10 with the lactam 5 under mildly basic conditions provides (R)-3-((3S,4S)-3-fluoro-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)piperidin-1-yl)-1-(4-methylbenzyl)pyrrolidin-2-one, the title compound of example 1. Scheme 1. Synthesis of (R)-3-((3S,4S)-3-fluoro-4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)piperidin-1-yl)-1-(4-methylbenzyl)pyrrolidin-2-one The compound of example 1 can be transformed into a variety of prodrugs using methods known in the art. Thus, according to scheme 2, treatment of the phenol with POCl3, pyridine, and DMAP followed by aqueous hydrolysis provides example 2, the dihydrogen phosphate ester of example 1. Scheme 2. Synthesis of example 2, the phosphonic acid prodrug of the compound of example 1 Similarly, reaction of the compound of example 1 with a Boc-protected amino acid using a variety of methods known in the art, but preferably using dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 4-dimethylaminopyridine provides the ester 11. Clevage of the Boc group in acid, preferably HCl, provides the esters which include the compounds of examples 3 and 4. Scheme 3. Synthesis of Amino Acid Prodrugs In a similar manner, Boc-protected aspartic acid tert-butyl ester (12) can be coupled through the unprotected sidechain to the compound of example 1 to provide the ester 13. Deprotection with HCl again provides the compound of example 5. Scheme 4.

Biological Methods Radioligand Binding Assay. Binding experiments to determine binding to NR2B-subtype NMDA receptors were performed on forebrains of 8-10 weeks old male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan, Netherlands) using 3H Ro 25-6981 (Mutel V; Buchy D; Klingelschmidt A; Messer J; Bleuel Z; Kemp J A; Richards J G. Journal of Neurochemistry, 1998, 70(5):2147-2155. Rats were decapitated without anesthesia using a Guillotine (approved by animal ethics committee) and the harvested brains were snap-frozen and stored at −80° C. for 3-6 months for membrane preparation. For membrane preparation, rat forebrains were thawed on ice for 20 minutes in homogenization buffer composed of 50 mM KH2PO4 (pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH), 1 mM EDTA, 0.005% Triton X 100 and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich). Thawed brains were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 48000×g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in cold buffer and homogenized again using a Dounce homogenizer. Subsequently, the homogenate was aliquoted, snap-frozen and stored at −80° C. for not more than 3-4 months. To perform the competition binding assay, thawed membrane homogenate was added to each well of a 96-well plate (20 μg/well). The experimental compounds were serially diluted in 100% DMSO and added to each row of the assay plate to achieve desired compound concentrations, keeping the DMSO concentration in the assay plate at 1.33% of the final reaction volume. Next, 3H Ro 25-6981 (4 nM) was added to the assay plate. After incubation for 1 hr at room temperature, the membrane bound radioligand was harvested on to GF/B filter plates (treated with 0.5% PEI for 1 hr at room temperature). The filter plates were dried at 50° C. for 20 mins, incubated with microscint 20 for 10 minutes and finally, the counts were read on TopCount (Perkin Elmer). Non-specific binding was determined using MK-0657 (the preparation of this compound is described as example 1 in WO 2004 108705 (40 μM). CPM values were converted to % inhibition and the concentration response curves were plotted using custom made software. Each experiment was repeated at least twice to obtain the final binding Ki values for experimental compounds. Using this assay, the compound of example 1 showed a binding Ki of 4 nM, the compound of example 6 showed a binding Ki of 4 nM, the compound of example 8 showed a binding Ki of 1.4 nM. Ex Vivo Occupancy Assay. This assay demonstrates that the compound of example 1 occupies brain-resident NR2B-subtype receptors in animals after dosing. 7-9 weeks old male CD-1 mice were dosed intravenously in a vehicle consisting of 10% dimethylacetamide, 40% PEG-400, 30% hydroxypropyl betacyclodextrin, and 30% water with experimental compounds and the forebrains were harvested 15 minutes post-dosing by decapitation. The brain samples were immediately snap-frozen and stored at −80° C. On the following day, the dosed brain samples were thawed on ice for 15-20 minutes followed by homogenization using Polytron for 10 seconds in cold homogenization buffer composed of 50 mM KH2PO4 (pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH), 1 mM EDTA, 0.005% Triton X 100 and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich). The crude homogenates were further homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer and the homogenized membrane aliquots from all animals were flash-frozen and stored at −80° C. until further use. The whole homogenization process was performed on ice. For determining occupancy, the membrane homogenates were first thawed on ice and then needle-homogenized using a 25 gauge needle. The homogenized membrane (6.4 mg/ml) was added to a 96-well plate followed by addition of 3H Ro 25-6981 (6 nM). The reaction mixture was incubated for 5 minutes on a shaker at 4° C. and then harvested onto GF/B filter plates (treated with 0.5% PEI for 1 hr at room temperature). The filter plates were dried at 50° C. for 20 mins, incubated with microscint 20 for 10 minutes and read on TopCount (Perkin Elmer). Each dose or compound group consisted of 4-5 animals. The control group of animals was dosed with vehicle alone. Membrane from each animal was added in triplicates to the assay plate. Non-specific binding was determined using 10 μM Ro 25-6981 added to the wells containing membrane homogenates from vehicle-dosed animals. Specific counts/minute was converted to % occupancy at each dose of a compound for each animal using the following equation: % ⁢ ⁢ Occupancy ⁢ ⁢ ( animal ⁢ ⁢ A ) = 100 - ( specific ⁢ ⁢ CPM ⁢ ⁢ of ⁢ ⁢ animal ⁢ ⁢ A Average ⁢ ⁢ CPM ⁢ ⁢ from ⁢ ⁢ control ⁢ ⁢ group × 100 ) Using this procedure, the compound of example 1 showed 95% NR2B receptor occupancy after a 3 mg/Kg i.v. dose. Drug levels were determined by mass spectroscopy in the usual manner. Drug levels in the blood plasma were 1106 nM in at this dose, and drug levels in the homogonized brain tissue were 1984 nM. The compound of example 6 showed 97% NR2B receptor occupancy after a 3 mg/Kg i.v. dose. Drug levels in the blood plasma were 1800 nM in at this dose, and drug levels in the homogonized brain tissue were 2200 nM. The compound of example 8 showed 96% NR2B receptor occupancy after a 3 mg/Kg i.v. dose. Drug levels in the blood plasma were 570 nM at this dose, and drug levels in the homogonized brain tissue were 900 nM. hERG Electrophysiology Assay. The experimental compounds were assessed for hERG activity on HEK 293 cells stably expressing hERG channels using patch clamp technique. Coverslips plated with hERG expressing cells were placed in the experimental chamber and were perfused with a solution composed of (in mM): 140 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 Glucose, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4, NaOH) at room temperature. Borosilicate patch pipettes had tip resistances of 2-4 Mohms when filled with an internal solution containing 130 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 5 ATP-K2 (pH 7.2, KOH). The cells were clamped at −80 mV in whole cell configuration using an Axopatch 200B (Axon instruments, Union City, Calif.) patch clamp amplifier controlled by pClamp (Axon instruments) software. Upon formation of a gigaseal, the following voltage protocol was repeatedly (0.05 Hz) applied to record tail currents: depolarization step from −80 mV to +20 mV for 2 seconds followed by a hyperpolarization step to −65 mV (3 seconds) to elicit tail currents and then, back to the holding potential. Compounds were applied after stabilization of tail current. First, tail currents were recorded in presence of extracellular solution alone (control) and subsequently, in extracellular solution containing increasing compound concentrations. Each compound concentration was applied for 2-5 minutes. The percentage inhibition at each concentration was calculated as reduction in peak tail current with respect to the peak tail current recorded in the presence of control solution. Data analysis was performed in custom made software. The percent inhibitions at different concentrations were plotted to obtain a concentration response curve, which was subsequently fitted with a four parameter equation to calculate the hERG IC50 value. Using this procedure, the compound of example 1 is a poor inhibitor of the hERG channel, with an IC50=28 μM. The compound of example 6 is a poor inhibitor of the hERG channel, with an IC50=13.5 μM. Mouse Forced Swim Test (mFST). Forced Swim Test (FST) is an animal model used to assess antidepressant compounds in preclinical studies. The FST was performed similar to the method of Porsolt et al. with modifications (Porsolt R D, Bertin A, Jalfre M. Behavioral despair in mice: a primary screening test for antidepressants. Arch Int Pharmacodyn Thér 1977; 229:327-36). In this paradigm, mice are forced to swim in an inescapable cylinder filled with water. Under these conditions, mice will initially try to escape and eventually develop immobility behavior; this behavior is interpreted as a passive stress-coping strategy or depression-like behavior. Swim tanks were positioned inside a box made of plastic. Each tank was separated from each other by opaque plastic sheets to the height of cylinders. Three mice were subjected to test at a time. Swim sessions were conducted for 6 min by placing mice in individual glass cylinders (46 cm height×20 cm diameter) containing water (20-cm deep, maintained at 24-25° C.). At this water level, the mouse tail does not touch the bottom of the container. The mouse was judged to be immobile whenever it remained floating passively without struggling in the water and only making those movements necessary to keep its nose/head above the water and to keep it afloat. The duration of immobility was evaluated during the total 6 min of the test and expressed as duration (sec) of immobility. Each mouse was tested only once. At the end of each session, mice were dried with a dry cloth and returned to their home cage placed on a thermal blanket to prevent hypothermia. Water was replaced after each trial. All testing sessions were recorded with a video camera (Sony Handicam, Model: DCR-HC38E; PAL) and scoring was done using the Forced Swim Scan, Version 2.0 software (Clever Systems Inc., Reston, Va., USA; see Hayashi E, Shimamura M, Kuratani K, Kinoshita M, Hara H. Automated experimental system capturing three behavioral components during murine forced swim test. Life Sci. 2011 Feb. 28; 88(9-10):411-7 and Yuan P, Tragon T, Xia M, Leclair C A, Skoumbourdis A P, Zheng W, Thomas C J, Huang R, Austin C P, Chen G, Guitart X. Phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors enhance sexual pleasure-seeking activity in rodents. Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 2011; 98(3):349-55). For NCE testing: Test compound was administered in mice 15 min before swim session by i.v. route and immobility time was recorded for next 6 min. At the end of FST, the mouse were euthanized by rapid decapitation method and plasma and brain samples were collected and stored under −80° C. till further analysis. In the mouse forced swim assay, the compound of example 1 was dosed intraveneously in a vehicle of 30% hydroxypropyl betacyclodextrin/70% citrate buffer pH 4 at a 5 mL/Kg dosing volume. The compound of example 1 demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in immobility time at 1 mg/Kg under these conditions. Drug levels were 268+/−128 nM in the plasma and 749+/−215 nM in the brain at this dose. The NR2B receptor occupancy was determined as reported above and was determined to be 73%. The compound of example 6 demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in immobility time at 1 mg/Kg under these same conditions. Drug levels were 360 nM in the plasma. The NR2B receptor occupancy was determined to be 79%. 1.
