BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic drawing of an embodiment of an OLED device comprising a compound disclosed herein. FIG. 2 is a schematic drawing of an embodiment of an OLED device described in Example 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION By employing a newly designed molecular structure, embodiments of which are demonstrated in Examples below, a new series of host materials is produced that can be used in OLED device applications. The synthesis of this series of host materials is straightforward and results in a high yield. Unless otherwise indicated, when a compound or chemical structural feature such as aryl is referred to as being “optionally substituted,” it is meant that the feature may have no substituents (i.e., unsubstituted) or may have one or more substituents. A feature that is “substituted” has one or more substituents. The term “substituent” has the ordinary meaning known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, the substituent may be an ordinary organic moiety known in the art, which may have a molecular weight (e.g., the sum of the atomic masses of the atoms of the substituent) of 15 g/mol to 50 g/mol, 15 g/mol to 100 g/mol, 15 g/mol to 200 g/mol, 15 g/mol to 300 g/mol, or 15 g/mol to 500 g/mol. In some embodiments, the substituent comprises, or consists of, 0-30, 0-20, 0-10, or 0-5 carbon atoms, and 0-30, 0-20, 0-10, or 0-5 heteroatoms independently selected from N, O, S, Si, F, Cl, Br, or I; provided that the substituent comprises at least one atom selected from C, N, O, S, Si, F, Cl, Br, or I. Examples of substituents include, but are not limited to, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, heteroalkyl, heteroalkenyl, heteroalkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, hydroxy, alkoxy, aryloxy, acyl, acyloxy, alkylcarboxylate, thiol, alkylthio, cyano, halo, thiocarbonyl, O-carbamyl, N-carbamyl, O-thiocarbamyl, N-thiocarbamyl, C-amido, N-amido, S-sulfonamido, N-sulfonamido, isocyanato, thiocyanato, isothiocyanato, nitro, silyl, sulfenyl, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, haloalkyl, haloalkoxyl, trihalomethanesulfonyl, trihalomethanesulfonamido, amino, etc. In some embodiments, two substituents may combine to form a ring. For convenience, the term “molecular weight” is used with respect to a moiety or part of a molecule to indicate the sum of the atomic masses of the atoms in the moiety or part of a molecule, even though it may not be a complete molecule. The structures associated with some of the chemical names referred to herein are depicted below. These structures may be unsubstituted, as shown below, or a substituent may independently be in any position normally occupied by a hydrogen atom when the structure is unsubstituted. Unless a point of attachment is indicated by , attachment may occur at any position normally occupied by a hydrogen atom. Some embodiments herein comprise optionally substituted N,N-diphenyl-4-(6-(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)pyridin-3-yl)aniline (BE-1); optionally substituted N-phenyl-N-(4′-(6-(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)naphthalen-1-amine (BE-2); optionally substituted 4′-(6′-(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-[3,3′-bipyridin]-6-yl)-N,N-di-p-tolyl-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-amine (BE-3); optionally substituted 9,9-dimethyl-N,N-diphenyl-7-(6′-(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-[3,3′-bipyridin]-6-yl)-9H-fluoren-2-amine (BE-4); optionally substituted N,N-diphenyl-4′-(6′-(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-[3,3′-bipyridin]-6-yl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-amine (BE-5); optionally substituted N,N-diphenyl-4′-(6′-(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-[2,3′-bipyridin]-5-yl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-amine (BE-6); optionally substituted 4′-(3-methyl-6′-(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-[2,3′-bipyridin]-5-yl)-N,N-diphenyl-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-amine (BE-7); optionally substituted N-phenyl-N-(4′-(6′-(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-[2,3′-bipyridin]-5-yl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)naphthalen-2-amine (BE-8); optionally substituted N-phenyl-N-(4′-(6′-(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-[2,3′-bipyridin]-5-yl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-yl)naphthalen-1-amine (BE-9); optionally substituted N,N-diphenyl-4-(6-(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-[3,2′:5′,3″-terpyridin]-6″-yl)aniline (BE-10); optionally substituted 4-methyl-N-(4-(6′-(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-[3,3′-bipyridin]-6-yl)phenyl)-N-(p-tolyl)aniline (BE-11); optionally substituted 4-methyl-N-(4-(6′-(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-[2,3′-bipyridin]-5-yl)phenyl)-N-(p-tolyl)aniline (BE-12); optionally substituted N-phenyl-N-(4-(6′-(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-[3,3′-bipyridin]-6-yl)phenyl)naphthalen-1-amine (BE-13); or, optionally substituted 9,9-dimethyl-7-(6′-(1-phenyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-[3,3′-bipyridin]-6-yl)-N,N-di-p-tolyl-9H-fluoren-2-amine (BE-14). As used herein the term “alkyl” has the broadest meaning generally understood in the art, and may include a moiety composed of carbon and hydrogen containing no double or triple bonds. Alkyl may be linear alkyl, branched alkyl, cycloalkyl, or a combination thereof, and in some embodiments, may contain from one to thirty-five carbon atoms. In some embodiments, alkyl may include C1-10 linear alkyl, such as methyl (—CH3), ethyl (—CH2CH3), n-propyl (—CH2CH2CH3), n-butyl (—CH2CH2CH2CH3), n-pentyl (—CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3), n-hexyl (—CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3), etc.; C3-10 branched alkyl, such as C3H7 (e.g., iso-propyl), C4H9 (e.g., branched butyl isomers), C5H11 (e.g., branched pentyl isomers), C6H13 (e.g., branched hexyl isomers), C7H15 (e.g., heptyl isomers), etc.; C3-10 cycloalkyl, such as C3H5 (e.g., cyclopropyl), C4H7 (e.g., cyclobutyl isomers such as cyclobutyl, methylcyclopropyl, etc.), C5H9 (e.g., cyclopentyl isomers such as cyclopentyl, methylcyclobutyl, dimethylcyclopropyl, etc.), C6H11 (e.g., cyclohexyl isomers), C7H13 (e.g., cycloheptyl isomers), etc.; and the like. With respect to an optionally substituted moiety such as optionally substituted alkyl, a phrase such as “optionally substituted C1-12 alkyl” refers to a C1-12 alkyl that may be unsubstituted, or may have 1 or more substituents, and does not limit the number of carbon atoms in any substituent. A phrase such as “C1-12 optionally substituted alkyl” refers to unsubstituted C1-12 alkyl, or substituted alkyl wherein both the alkyl parent and all substituents have from 1-12 carbon atoms. Similar conventions may be applied to other optionally substituted moieties such as aryl and heteroaryl. Substituents on alkyl may be the same as those described generally above, except that alkyl may not have an alkyl substituent. In some embodiments, substituents on alkyl are independently selected from F, Cl, Br, I, CN, CO2H, —O-alkyl, ester groups, acyl, amine groups, and amide groups, and may have a molecular weight of about 15 to about 100 or about 500. The term “perfluoroalkyl” refers to fluoroalkyl with a formula CnF2n—F1 for a linear or branched structure. Perfluoroalkyl can be, for example: CF3, C2F5, C3F7, C4F9, C5F11, C6F13, etc.; or, CnF2n for a cyclic structure, e.g., cyclic C3F6, cyclic C4F8, cyclic C5F10, cyclic C6F12, etc. In other words, every hydrogen atom in the alkyl is replaced by fluorine. For example, C1-3 perfluoroalkyl refers to CF3, C2F5, and C3F7 isomers. As used herein the term “aryl” has the broadest meaning generally understood in the art, and may include an aromatic ring or aromatic ring system such as phenyl, naphthyl, etc. The term “heteroaryl” also has the meaning understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, and includes an “aryl” which has one or more heteroatoms in the ring or ring system, such as pyridinyl, furyl, thienyl, oxazolyl, thiazolyl, imidazolyl, indolyl, quinolinyl, benzofuranyl, benzothienyl, benzoxazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzimidazolyl, etc. If stereochemistry is not indicated, a name or structural depiction includes any stereoisomer or any mixture of stereoisomers. With respect to any relevant formula or structural depiction herein, HT can be optionally substituted diphenylamine or optionally substituted phenylnaphthylamine. If HT is substituted, it may have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more, substituents. Any substituent may be included on HT.

The compounds and compositions described herein can be incorporated into light-emitting devices in various ways. For example, an embodiment provides an organic component disposed between an anode and a cathode. In some embodiments, the device may be configured so that holes can be transferred from the anode to the organic component. In some embodiments, the device may be configured so that electrons can be transferred from the cathode to the organic component. The organic component may comprise the compounds and/or compositions described herein. The anode may be a layer comprising a conventional material such as a metal, mixed metal, alloy, metal oxide or mixed-metal oxide, conductive polymer, and/or an inorganic material such as carbon nanotube (CNT). Examples of suitable metals include the Group 1 metals, the metals in Groups 4, 5, 6, and the Group 8-10 transition metals. If the anode layer is to be light-transmitting, metals in Group 10 and 11, such as Au, Pt, and Ag, or alloys thereof; or mixed-metal oxides of Group 12, 13, and 14 metals, such as indium-tin-oxide (ITO), indium-zinc-oxide (IZO), and the like, may be used. In some embodiments, the anode layer may be an organic material such as polyaniline. The use of polyaniline is described in, e.g., “Flexible light-emitting diodes made from soluble conducting polymer,” Nature, vol. 357, pp. 477-479 (11 Jun. 1992), which is incorporated by reference herein for its relevant teachings. Examples of suitable high work function metals and metal oxides include but are not limited to Au, Pt, or alloys thereof; ITO; IZO; and the like. In some embodiments, the anode layer can have a thickness in the range of about 1 nm to about 1000 nm. A cathode may be a layer including a material having a lower work function than the anode layer. Examples of suitable materials for the cathode layer include those selected from alkali metals of Group 1, Group 2 metals, Group 12 metals including rare earth elements, lanthanides and actinides, materials such as aluminum, indium, calcium, barium, samarium and magnesium, and combinations thereof.

Suitable low work function metals include but are not limited to Al, Ag, Mg, Ca, Cu, Mg/Ag, LiF/Al, CsF, CsF/Al or alloys thereof. In some embodiments, the cathode layer can have a thickness in the range of about 1 nm to about 1000 nm. In some embodiments, the organic component may comprise at least one light-emitting layer comprising a light-emitting component, and optionally, a host. A host may comprise a compound described herein, a hole-transport material, an electron-transport material, and/or an ambipolar material. In some embodiments, the device may be configured so that holes can be transferred from the anode to the light-emitting layer. In some embodiments, the device may be configured so that electrons can be transferred from the cathode to the light-emitting layer. If present, the amount of the host in a light-emitting layer can vary. In one embodiment, the amount of a host in a light-emitting layer may be in the range of from about 1% to about 99.9% by weight of the light-emitting layer. In another embodiment, the amount of a host in a light-emitting layer may be in the range of from about 90% to about 99% by weight of the light-emitting layer. In another embodiment, the amount of a host in a light-emitting layer may be about 97% by weight of the light-emitting layer. In some embodiments, the mass of the light-emitting component may be about 0.1% to about 10%, about 1% to about 5%, or about 3% of the mass of the light-emitting layer. In some embodiments, the light-emitting layer may be a neat light-emitting layer, meaning that the light-emitting component is about 100% by weight of the light-emitting layer, or alternatively, the light-emitting layer consists essentially of light-emitting component. The light-emitting component may be a fluorescent and/or a phosphorescent compound. In some embodiments, the light-emitting component comprises a phosphorescent material. The light-emitting component or compound may be chosen to vary the color of the light emitted by the light-emitting device. For example, a blue light-emitting component may emit a combination of visible photons so that the light appears to have a blue quality to an observer. In some embodiments, a blue light-emitting component may emit visible photons having an average wavelength in the range of about 440 nm or about 460 nm to about 490 nm or about 500 nm. The “average wavelength” of visible photons may include, when referring to the visible emission spectrum of a compound, the wavelength wherein the area under the curve for the part of the visible spectrum having a lower wavelength than the average wavelength is about equal to the area under the curve for the part of the visible spectrum having a higher wavelength than the average wavelength. Some non-limiting examples of compounds which may form part or all of a blue light-emitting component include iridium coordination compounds such as: bis-{2-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]pyridinato-N,C2′}iridium(III)-picolinate, bis-(2-[4,6-difluorophenyl]pyridinato-N,C2′)iridium (III) picolinate, bis(2-[4,6-difluorophenyl]pyridinato-N,C2′)iridium(acetylacetonate), Iridium (III) bis(4,6-difluorophenylpyridinato)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-5-(pyridine-2-yl)-1,2,4-triazolate, Iridium (III) bis(4,6-difluorophenylpyridinato)-5-(pyridine-2-yl)-1H-tetrazolate, bis[2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyridinato-N,C2′]iridium(III)tetra(1-pyrazolyl)borate, etc. The structures corresponding to these compounds are as follows: The thickness of a light-emitting layer may vary. In one embodiment, a light-emitting layer may have a thickness in the range of from about 1 nm to about 150 nm or about 200 nm. In some embodiments, the light-emitting device may emit white light. A light-emitting layer may be configured to emit white light by including a white light emitter, or a combination of colored emitters which have a combined emission that appears white. Alternatively, a combination of different colored light-emitting layers may be configured to emit white light.

Light-emitting devices comprising the compounds described herein can be fabricated using techniques known in the art, as informed by the guidance provided herein. For example, a glass substrate can be coated with a high work functioning metal such as ITO which can act as an anode. After patterning the anode layer, a hole-injection and/or hole-transport layer may be deposited on the anode in that order. A light-emitting layer that includes a light-emitting component can be deposited on the anode, the hole-transport layer, or the hole-injection layer. The light-emitting layer may contain a compound described herein, and/or a compound described herein may be part of an electron-transport layer and/or an electron-injecting layer, deposited in that order, or may be part of an electron-injecting and electron-transport layer. The cathode layer, comprising a low work functioning metal (e.g., Mg:Ag), can then be deposited, e.g., by vapor deposition or sputtering. The device may also contain an exciton-blocking layer, an electron blocking layer, a hole blocking layer, a second light-emitting layer, or other layers that can be added to the device using suitable techniques.
