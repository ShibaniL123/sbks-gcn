Subject matter of the present invention is an emulsifiable concentrate comprising a water-insoluble pesticide, an amide of the formula (I) R1-C(O)N(R2)2 (I) where R1 is C5-C19-alkyl, and R2 is C1-C4-alkyl, a carbonate, which is ethylene carbonate or propylene carbonate, and a hydrocarbon solvent. A further subject matter is an emulsion obtainable by mixing water with the emulsifiable concentrate; a process for the preparation of the emulsifiable concentrate; and a method for controlling phytopathogenic fungi and/or undesired vegetation and/or undesired attack by insects or mites and/or for regulating the growth of plants, where the concentrate or the emulsion is allowed to act on the respective pests, their environment or on the crop plants to be protected from the respective pests, on the soil and/or on undesired plants and/or on the crop plants and/or their environment. The present invention comprises combinations of preferred features with other preferred features. Emulsifiable concentrates (also referred to as emulsion concentrates or EC) are widely used formulations in crop protection. WO2011/085310 discloses a matrix composition capable of forming an emulsion and comprising a long chain substituted amide, and optionally an organic diluent. A disadvanatage is that the composition must be essentially free of alkoxylated alcohols. WO93/00809 discloses an emulsifiable concentrate comprising a surfactant and a solvent selected either from a first component having a high hydrophilic property or in the alternative from a second component having a HLB of 2-8. The disadvantages of the known emulsion concentrates are the poor cold stability, the pronounced tendency to crystallize and the low pesticide concentration. It was an object of the present invention to provide an emulsion concentrate which overcomes these disadvantages. The object was achieved by an emulsifiable concentrate comprising a water-insoluble pesticide; an amide of the formula (I) R1-C(O)N(R2)2 (I) where R1 is C5-C19-alkyl, and R2 is C1-C4-alkyl; a carbonate, which is ethylene carbonate or propylene carbonate; and a C6-C20 hydrocarbon solvent, which has a solubility in water of not more than 5% at 20°C, wherein the emulsifiable concentrate comprises not more than 35% by weight of the amide of the formula (I), not more than 40% by weight of the carbonate, and at least 15% by weight of the hydrocarbon solvent. Usually, an emulsifiable concentrate is taken to mean compositions which form an oil-in-water emulsion upon mixing with water (e.g. in a weight ratio of 1 part concentrate to 99 parts water). The emulsion usually arises spontaneously. The resulting emulsion may have an average droplet size of more than 0.1 µm, preferably more than 0.5 µm, in particular more than 0.8 µm, and most preferred more than 1.1 µm. The average droplet size may be determined by laser diffraction, e.g. with a Malvern Mastersizer 2000. The concentrate is preferably present as a homogeneous solution. It is usually virtually free from dispersed particles. Preferred amides of the formula (I) are those in which R1 is C7-C11-alkyl and R2 is methyl. Especially preferred amides of the formula (I) are those in which R1 is C7-C9-alkyl and R2 is methyl. Mixtures of amides of the formula (I) are also possible, for example mixtures where R1 is C7-C11-alkyl and R2 is methyl. Mixtures of amides of the formula (I) comprise in most cases two amides of the formula (I) in an amount of in each case at least 30% by weight (preferably at least 40% by weight) based on the total amount of amides of the formula (I). The concentrate comprises not more than 35% by weight and in particular not more than 25% by weight of amide of the formula (I). The concentrate can comprise at least 3% by weight, preferably at least 8% by weight and in particular at least 15% by weight of amide of the formula (I). The preferred carbonate is propylene carbonate. Mixtures of propylene carbonate and ethylene carbonate are also possible. The concentrate can comprise not more than 40% by weight, preferably not more than 20% by weight and in particular not more than 15% by weight of carbonate (such as propylene carbonate). The concentrate can comprise at least 1% by weight, preferably at least 3% by weight and in particular at least 5% by weight of carbonate (such as propylene carbonate). Suitable hydrocarbon solvents are aliphatic (such as linear or cyclic) or aromatic hydrocarbons. Preferred hydrocarbon solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons. Aromatic hydrocarbons may, besides at least one aromatic hydrocarbon unit, also comprise aliphatic hydrocarbon substituents. The hydrocarbon solvent has a solubility in water of not more than 5% by weight, preferably not more than 1 % by weight and in particular not more than 0.3% by weight at 20°C. In most cases, the hydrocarbon solvent has a boiling point at 1013 mbar of at least 100°C, preferably at least 150°C and in particular at least 180°C. Usually, the hydrocarbon solvent comprises only carbon and hydrogen atoms. The hydrocarbon solvent is a C6-C20-hydrocarbon, in particular a C8-C16-hydrocarbon. Suitable aromatic hydrocarbons are above all alkyl-substituted aromatics, such as toluene, the xylenes, ethylbenzenes and benzenes having longer-chain alkyl radicals, for example C9-C10-dialkyl- and -trialkylbenzenes (for example Solvesso® 100 from Exxon Mobile Europe or Aromatic 100 from Exxon Mobile USA), C10-C11alkylbenzenes (for example Solvesso® 150 from Exxon Mobile Europe or Aromatic 150 from Exxon Mobile USA) and alkylnaphthalenes (for example Solvesso® 200 from Exxon Mobile Europe or Aromatic 200 from Exxon Mobile USA). Also suitable are mixtures of the abovementioned aromatics. Preferably, the aromatic hydrocarbon comprises not more than 5% by weight, more preferably not more than 2% by weight and in particular not more than 1 % by weight of naphthalene, based on the total weight of the aromatic solvent. Such solvents with a naphthalene content of not more than 1 % by weight are commercially available for example from Exxon Mobile Europe with the designation ND (naphthalene depleted), for example Solvesso® 150 ND and Solvesso® 200 ND from Exxon Mobile Europe. Even lower naphthalene contents of not more than 0.1 % by weight are present in the products Aromatic 150 ULN and Aromatic 200 ULN from Exxon Mobile USA. The concentrate can comprise not more than 80% by weight, preferably not more than 65% by weight and in particular not more than 55% by weight of hydrocarbon solvent. The concentrate comprises at least 15% by weight, preferably at least 25% by weight and in particular at least 35% by weight of hydrocarbon solvent. The concentrate can comprise from 5 to 35% by weight of the amide of the formula (I), from 1 to 20% by weight of the carbonate and from 20 to 85% by weight of the hydrocarbon solvent. Preferably, the solvent can comprise from 10 to 30% by weight of the amide of the formula (I), from 2 to 15% by weight of the carbonate and from 30 to 70% by weight of the hydrocarbon solvent. In most cases, the concentrate is largely free from water. It can comprise not more than 3% by weight, preferably not more than 1 % by weight and in particular not more than 0.5% by weight of water.

The concentrate preferably comprises at least one nonionic surfactant (such as alkoxylates). The concentrate usually comprises not less than 3% by weight of nonionic surfactants, preferably not less than 8% by weight and in particular not less than 15% by weight. The composition can comprise not more than 65% by weight of nonionic surfactants, preferably not more than 45% by weight and in particular not more than 35% by weight. The invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of the emulsifiable concentrate according to the invention by mixing the water-insoluble pesticide, the carbonate, the amide of the formula (I) and the hydrocarbon solvent. The invention furthermore relates to an emulsion obtainable (preferably obtained) by mixing water with the emulsifiable concentrate according to the invention. The emulsion normally arises spontaneously upon mixing. In most cases, the emulsion is an oil-in-water emulsion. The mixing ratio of water to concentrate can be in the range of from 1000 to 1 up to 1 to 1, preferably 200 to 1 up to 3 to 1. The invention furthermore relates to a method for controlling phytopathogenic fungi and/or undesired vegetation and/or undesired attack by insects or mites and/or for regulating the growth of plants, where the concentrate according to the invention or the emulsion according to the invention is allowed to act on the respective pests, their environment or on the crop plants to be protected from the respective pests, on the soil and/or on undesired plants and/or on the crop plants and/or their environment. When employed in crop protection, the application rates of the pesticides amount to from 0.001 to 2 kg per ha, preferably from 0.005 to 2 kg per ha, especially preferably from 0.05 to 0.9 kg per ha and in particular from 0.1 to 0.75 kg per ha, depending on the nature of the desired effect. In treatment of plant propagation materials such as seeds, e.g. by dusting, coating or drenching seed, amounts of active substance of from 0.1 to 1000 g, preferably from 1 to 1000 g, especially preferably from 1 to 100 g and in particular from 5 to 100 g, per 100 kg of plant propagation material (preferably seed) are generally required. When used in the protection of materials or stored products, the amount of active substance applied depends on the kind of application area and on the desired effect. Amounts customarily applied in the protection of materials are 0.001 g to 2 kg, preferably 0.005 g to 1 kg, of active substance per cubic meter of treated material. Various types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, fertilizers or micronutrients and further pesticides (for example herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, growth regulators, safeners) may be added to the emulsion in the form of a premix or optionally only shortly before use (tank mix). These agents can be admixed to the compositions according to the invention at a weight ratio of from 1:100 to 100:1, preferably from 1:10 to 10:1. The user applies the composition according to the invention usually from a predosage device, a knapsack sprayer, a spray tank, a spray plane, or an irrigation system. Usually, the agrochemical composition is made up with water, buffer, and/or further auxiliaries to the desired application concentration and the ready-to-use spray liquor or the agrochemical composition according to the invention is thus obtained. Usually, 20 to 2000 liters, preferably 50 to 400 liters, of the ready-to-use spray liquor are applied per hectare of agricultural useful area. Advantages of the present invention are, inter alia, that the concentrate is highly stable at low temperatures (e.g. even below 0 °C); that the pesticide does not precipitate, cream or crystallize in the concentrate at low temperatures; that high pesticide concentrations in the concentrate can be employed; that an emulsion forms spontaneously upon dilution of the concentrate with water; that the concentrate is capable of being stored over prolonged periods; that adjuvants can be included in the concentrate formulations; that the concentrate causes no, or little, irritation of the skin or eyes; that the concentrate does not require the presence of water (e.g. because it might freeze below 0 °C or would favour bacterial growth during storage); that the concentrate forms a stable emulsion upon dilution with water; that the concentrate; that the concentrate may comprise alkoxylated alcohol (which are usually very helpful surfactants and/or adjuvants); or that the concentration of the carbonate or of the amide of the formula (I) in the concentrate can be reduced.
