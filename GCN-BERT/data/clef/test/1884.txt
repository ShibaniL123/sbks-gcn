4-(6-Fluoro-1H-indol-3-yl)-N-[(1S)-1-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-propil]benzamide
To a cold solution (0 °C) of 4-[6-fluoro-1-(p-tolylsulfonyl)indol-3-yl]benzoic acid (Intermediate 3-a, 35 mg, 0.094 mmol) and (2S)-2-amino-3-methyl-butan-1-ol (10 mg, 0.1 mmol) in DCM/DMF = 4/1 v/v% (1.5 ml) was added triethylamine (36 µl, 0.26 mmol) and HATU (35 mg, 0.086 mmol), after which the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 3 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with DCM (5 ml) and subsequently washed with water, aq. 5% NaHCO3 and brine. The organic layer was separated by filtration over a PE filter and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (heptane to ethyl acetate = 10/0 to 0/10 v/v%) to afford 4-[6-fluoro-1-(p-tolylsulfonyl)indol-3-yl]-N-[(1S)-1-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-propyl]benzamide: 35 mg (64.5% yield). The purified compound was dissolved in THF (5 ml) and 1 M TBAF in THF (350 µl, 0.35 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture. After heating under reflux for 2 h, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo. Purification was performed using preparative HPLC to afford the title compound (2.6 mg, 9%). Data: LCMS (B) Rt: 10.675 min; m/z 341.2 (M+H)+.
