USE OF ALLOGENEIC INTERSTITIAL VESSEL-LAYER CELL AND ALLOGENEIC MESENCHYMAL PROGENITOR CELL FOR PREVENTING OR TREATING OSTEOARTHRITIS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention belongs to the field of stem cells and biomedicine. Specifically, the present invention relates to the use of allogeneic interstitial vessel-layer cells and allogeneic mesenchymal progenitor cells for preventing or treating osteoarthritis. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Osteoarthritis (ΟΑ) is a chronic joint disease characterized by degeneration and destruction of articular cartilage as well as bone hyperplasia. The morbidity of ΟΑ is 50% in populations over 60 and 80% in those over 75, and the disability rate of ΟΑ is up to 53% (“Osteoarthritis Treatment Guidelines (Rev)”, Chinese Medical Association of Orthopaedics, 2007). ΟΑ is common in joints suffering from heavy burden and frequent activities, such as knee, namely knee osteoarthritis (ΚΟΑ). Knee osteoarthritis is one of major diseases which lead to activity dysfunction in elder people, and leads to heavy financial burden to health insurance and family. At present, the general principle for treating knee osteoarthritis (ΚΟΑ) is the combination of drug and non-drug therapy with surgeries when necessary so as to achieve the relief or elimination of pain, deformity correction, joint function improvement or restoration, thereby improving quality of life. Drug therapy mainly comprises analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) or corticosteroids, drugs for improving the state of illness and cartilage protection agents, etc. These drugs can to some extent delay the course of the disease and improve patients symptoms. However, the efficacy is limited, the pathological progression is irreversible, the cartilage damage is irreparable, and most of the drugs have obvious side effects. When conventional therapy turns out to be invalid, surgeries are needed for the patients with joint deformity and joint dysfunction. Surgical treatments are conducted mainly by arthroscopic (endoscope) and open surgery. Even though they can temporarily relieve pain, they are expensive and have poor long-term effect. It is reported those 10 - 15 years after joint replacement surgery, the prosthesis started to get worn or even loosen. Therefore, the present studies aim at exploring novel treatments and repair strategies. Tissue engineering dedicates in autologous chondrocyte transplantation or matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte transplantation and provides the possibility of long-term solution for biologically repairing or regenerating the degraded joint tissues. However, this type of technology is mainly limited in treating large cartilage defects. Factors such as the damages to the donors’ site, the dedifferentiation and the limited survival time of cartilage cells make the method being unsuitable for ΚΟΑ patients. Currently, many studies are targeting to allogeneic mesenchymal progenitor cells from other sources, such as adipose allogeneic mesenchymal progenitor cells. Adipose allogeneic mesenchymal progenitor cells are characterized by their extensive sources, safety, low immunogenicity and excellent immunoregulation ability, thereby exhibiting a unique effect on the treatments of ΚΟΑ. The applicant has also developed autologous adipose mesenchymal progenitor cells with definite clinical curative effects. However, autologous adipose can not be provided by some ΚΟΑ patients, such as patients having infectious diseases, or the old and emaciated ones, resulting in those patients unable to use autologous fat mesenchymal progenitor cells to treat ΚΟΑ. Therefore, the applicant develops allogeneic mesenchymal progenitor cells to meet the demands of those patients.

Allogeneic interstitial vessel-layer cells and allogeneic mesenchymal progenitor cells possess chondrogenic differentiation abilities and osteogenic differentiation abilities. The present invention also provides a method for preventing and/or treating osteoarthritis, and a pharmaceutical composition comprising allogeneic interstitial vessel-layer cells or allogeneic mesenchymal progenitor cells. The present invention is completed on this basis. Terms As used herein, terms “more than” and “less than” includes the number itself, e.g., “more than 95%” means >95%, “less than 0.2%” means <0.2%. Osteoarthritis As used herein, terms “osteoarthritis” and “OA” can be used interchangeably. Osteoarthritis is a chronic joint disease with main changes of degeneration of articular cartilage surface and secondary hyperostosis manifesting joint pain and stiffness. X-ray shows joint space narrowing, subchondral bone eburnation, bone trabecula fracture, sclerosis, cystic degeneration, lip-like hyperplasia in joint edge, capitulum deformation in late stage, unevenness in articular surface, articular cartilage denudation, and intra-articular free bodies formed by fallen fracture bones. In the present invention, said osteoarthritis can be any osteoarthritis selected from the following group consisting of knee osteoarthritis, spinal osteoarthritis, hip osteoarthritis, and the combinations thereof. The osteoarthritis of the present invention is preferably knee osteoarthritis. Adipose Fat is a good source for plastics and anti-aging treatments. Adipose tissue materials can be derived from the parts of waist, hips, abdomen, thighs, upper arms, etc. Those skilled in the art may obtain adipose tissues by common techniques and methods including (but not limited to) suction or surgical separation, etc. In the present invention, adipose tissues or adipose sources are not specifically limited. They may be derived from any part of animal or human adipose tissues, preferably human adipose tissues.

They can be easily obtained from a large reservation amount in the body, they are suitable for large-scale cultivation and do little harm to the body, and they can be obtained from extensive sources with low antigenicity, thereby suitable for allograft. SVF is the most important component in stem cell-assisted fat tranplant. Cell clusters formed by mixture containing varieties of cells isolated from adipose tissues by collagenase digestion are called stromal vascular fragments. Stromal vascular fragments comprise abundant mesenchymal cells, which can differentiate into multiple lineages of cells, thus being the ideal seed cells in regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, etc. As used herein, the terms "separation method" and "SVF separation method" can be used interchangeably, both referring to the method or the processes for obtaining isolated SVF from the original adipose tissues. The obtained SVF adipocyte materials are firstly washed to remove blood cells; then subjected to fat breaking and digestion. Undigested tissues are removed to obtain a filtrate containing SVF and SVF are obtained by centrifugation. Obtained SVF may be used for further passage, cultivation or cryopreservation. In a preferred embodiment, the separation of SVF may include (but not limited to) the following steps: washing the adipose obtained from liposuction by PBS twice, and then digesting in 37 °C condition for 30 mins by collagenase, obtaining SVF fragments of high density mainly comprising mesenchymal cells, endothelial cells and parietal cells upon centrifugation at 1200 g for 10 mins.

The detection of cytokines secreted from cells SVF and haMPCs were cultivated in the culture chamber for 48h, the supernatant was taken for detecting the cytokines secreted by cells. The umbilical cord derived stem cells were used as the control group. The results are shown in Table 3. Table 3 Cytokines (unit) hADMPCs SVF Umbilical cord derived stem cells VEGF(pg/ml) 19.81 24.13 18.21 TGF-B (pg/ml) 398.00 180.11 415.02 GM-CSF (ng/ml) 43.66 62.50 63.46 HGF (ng/ml) 0.56 0.65 0.54 PDGF (ng/ml) 0.01 0.01 0.01 IF-2(pg/ml) 38.90 38.56 33.18 IF-10(pg/ml) 44.32 42.31 40.56 The results showed that: SVF and haMPCs have good cytokine secretion function, which is comparable to umbilical cord stem cells. Example 3 haMPCs stimulation test (1) fresh and frozen haMPCs were separately placed in complete culture medium and 5% FBS medium for cultivation and VEGF secreted by haMPCs was detected. The results shows (Fig. 3 A) that, the concentration of VEGF of fresh haMPCs in complete culture medium group decreased with the increase of LPS concentration; the concentration of VEGF of the fresh haMPCs in 5% FBS culture medium group was the same as that of the control group at 200 ng/ml, while the concentration of VEGF decreased at 100 ng/ml and 300 ng/ml respectively. The concentration of VEGF of the frozen haMPCs cultivated in complete culture medium substantialy changed little when the concentrations of LPS increased. Generally, the concentration of VEGF cultivated in serum-containing culture medium was higher than that in the complete culture medium . (2) the amounts of VEGF secreted from haMPCs under hypoxia stimulation were detected. It was found that VEGF secretion under hypoxia stimulation was 2-3 times of that of normal cultivation, and the secretion amounta of 48 hours was 2 times of that of 24 hours, the increment of VEGF was proportional to the increment of the concentration of cells (FIG. 3Β). Example 4 Chondrogenic Differentiation Test of haMPCs A chondrogenic differentiation kit GIBCO STEMPRO was employed to prepare chondrogenic differential medium. haMPCs are digested and centrifuged to obtain Ρ3 generation cells, and standard medium was used to prepare a cell suspension of 1.6 χ 10 A 7 living cells/mF for later application. 5 μΕ cell suspension (the cell volume was 8 χ 104) was drawn with a pipette, and seeded in the centers of the multi-well plate, and subjected to pre-incubation in a C02 incubator for 2 hours. After the pre-incubation was over, 1 mF of chondrogenic differential complete medium preheated by 37 °C water bath was added into the test wells, and 1 mF of standard medium preheated by lmF 37 °C water bath was added into the control wells. The multi-well plate was placed into C02 incubator for culture under 37 °C, 5% C02. During the culture, the medium in the corresponding plate wells were changed every 2-3 days. After a sufficient incubation time (7 or 14 days), 4% formalin solution (1 mF 40% formaldehyde dissolved in 9 mF of water) and 1% Alcian Blue dye (0. lg Alcian Blue dissolved in lOmF of 0.1 Ν HCF) were prepared on the very day. Fixing and dyeing treatment was conducted to each well. The medium was removed by suction, and washed with DPBS for once. The cells were fixed with 4% formalin solution for 30 minutes. After fixation, DPBS was used for washing, and then 1% Alcian Blue solution (dissolved in 0.1Ν HC1) was added for staining for 30 minutes. 0.1Ν HC1 was used for washing for three times, and distilled water was added to neutralize the acid. The experimental groups and the control groups were observed in the light microscope, and the pictures were saved. The experimental groups which successfully differentiated into cartilage cells turned blue after Alcian Blue staining due to the proteoglycan synthesized by chondrocyte. Experiment results: On the seventh day of the experiment, the growth of the cells was observed, and wells Al, A3, and Cl were selected for imgage analysis. Upon observation, it can be seen that the cells concentrated in the center of inoculation region in well Al (Figure 4.1), while the cell shape was circular, which was approximate to cartilage cells, and the tightness of adherent of cells was ordinary, but could maintain its adherent state after medium was changed for several times; the cells in well A3 (Figure 4.2) formed a highly aggregated globular cell mass structure, and a milk white spherical structure can be seen by naked eye; said structure was maintained after changing medium for several times, while the possibility of contamination was excluded; well Cl (Figure 4.3) was added with standard medium as a control group, in which the cell morphology meets the standard of haMPCs adherent cells. Therefore, morphologically, there are significant differences between the haMPCs cultivated through differential medium and the control group. The Alcian Blue staining results on the 14th day of the experiment indicateed that, well Cl (4.6) did not show significant blue staining, while well Α1 (Figure 4.4) showed significant blue staining, which proved the existence of glycosaminoglycan synthesized by chondrocytes; and the staining of well A3 (Figure 4.5) turned black-blue probably due to the over density of the cells. Therefore, the haMPCs cultivated in differentiation medium culture showed the differentiation characteristics of cartilage cell in classical chemical staining process. In summary, the present example shows that the haMPCs of the present invention shows cartilage cell characteristics in cell morphology and classical chemical staining process when cultivated in differentiation medium culture, which indicates that haMPCs have the differentiation potential to chondrocytes. Example 5 haMPCs Osteogenic Differentiation Test An osteogenesis differentiation kit GIBCO STEMPRO was employed to prepare osteogenesis differential medium. haMPCs are digested and centrifuged to obtain Ρ3 generation cells, and growth medium was used to prepare a cell suspension for later application. The haMPCs were seeded in a multi-well plate at a density of 5*103 cells/cm2, and subjected to pre-culture in a C02 incubator for 2 hours. After the pre-incubation was over, 1 mL of chondrogenic differential complete medium preheated by 37 °C water bath was added into the test wells, and 1 mL of standard medium preheated by lmL 37 °C water bath was added into the control wells. The multi-well plate was placed into C02 incubator for culture under 37 °C, 5% C02. During the culture, the medium in the corresponding plate wells were changed every 3-4 days. After a sufficient incubation time (> 21 days), 4% formalin solution (1 mL 40% formaldehyde dissolved in 9 mL of water) and 1% Alcian Blue dye (0. lg Alcian Blue dissolved in lOmL of 0.1 Ν HCL) were prepared on the very day. Fixing and dyeing treatment was conducted to each well. The medium was removed by suction, and washed with DPBS for once. The cells were fixed with 4% formalin solution for 30 minutes. After fixation, distilled water was used for washing, and then 2% Alcian Blue solution (pH 4.2) was added for staining for 2-3 minutes, distilled water was used for washing for three times. The experimental groups and the control groups were observed in the light microscope, and the pictures were saved. Experimental results: On the 25th day of the experiment, the growth of cells was observed. The staining of experimental group showed that the nodular depositions were light brown, which was verified to be calcium depositions (Figure 5.1); while the staining of the control group shown negative (Figure 5.2). In summary, the present example shows that haMPCs of the present invention shows osteocytes' characteristics in cell morphology and classical chemical staining process when cultivated in osteogenesis differentiation medium culture, which indicates that haMPCs have the differentiation potential to osteocytes. Example 6 Animal Safety Test of SVF Human adipose-derived stromal vascular cells (hSVF) was injected to SD rats through caudal vein. The cell doses were 1.0χ 109/65 kg for higher dose group and 5.0χ 107/65 kg for appropriate amount group. After 48 hours, no abnormal allergic reaction such as rash, piloelection, tachypnea, or tremors was observed. None of the rats died.. The observation lasted for 10 weeks, and the rats were in good living conditions with nomal body temperature, appetite and weight change. Wherein, the weight change in appropriate amount group, high-dose group and the control group, respectively, were raised to 502g, 489g and 493g from the original lOOg. No significant difference was shown. Two weeks after the end of hSVF injection, the serum albumin, globulin and albumin/globulin levels in SD rats are all in the normal range (Table 4), and the indicators such as AFT, urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose are all within normal range (Table 5). There was no significant difference between experimental group and control group. This study showed that intravenous injection of SVF are safe for rats, and the interspecies use of SVF did not cause immune rejection.

The doses were 3.1xl02/g for the appropriate amount group and 1.5xl03/g for the high dose group. Continuous observation of 14 days was conducted after injection, the experimental animals were in good living condition, and no abnormal reaction was observed with body temperature, appetite and weight change. Wherein, weight gaining in the appropriate amount group and high dose group and control group was 11.8%, 13.9% and 14.3% respectively, and there was no significant difference between the groups. In vivo injection of haMPCs did not lead to significant effects on the liver, spleen, kidney, lung, brain, heart, thymus, thyroid or testis/ovary or other major organs, and the organ indexes did not change significantly. It was observed that liver, kidney, spleen and testis/ovary were structurally nomal under light microscopy, and no pathological change such as mesenchyme hyperplasia, fatty infiltration or inflammatory cell infiltration was observed. Only in spleen from the experimental group, significant increase of megakaryocytes or polynuclear giant cells can be seen, which was probably related to the macrophages immune response caused by the injection of haMPCs and pending for further study. In this experiment, the mice blood biochemical parameters were within the normal range, and there were no significant differences among the appropriate amount group, the high dose group or the control group (Table 6-8). This study showed that intravenous injection of haMPCs was safe for mice, and the interspecies use of haMPCs did not cause immune rejection.
