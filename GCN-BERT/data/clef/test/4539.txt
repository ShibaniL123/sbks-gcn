(6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-6-(4-((1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)oxy)-2-methoxyphenyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
1-Fluoro-3-iodopropane (5.79 μL, 0.05 mmol) was added to a solution of (6S,8R)-6-(4-(azetidin-3-yloxy)-2-methoxyphenyl)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline trifluoroacetic acid salt (0.030 g, 0.050 mmol) and DIPEA (0.029 mL, 0.16 mmol) in NMP (0.52 ml) at room temperature. After 3 hours, the reaction was diluted with EtOAc (40 mL) and washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (3×20 mL). The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 15 to 30% (MeOH in DCM containing 1% ammonium hydroxide) in DCM to afford (6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-6-(4-((1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)oxy)-2-methoxyphenyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (5 mg, 18%) as white solid.
