NEW STRATEGIES FOR TREATING MELANOMA FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention is broadly situated in the medical field, more specifically in the field of treatment of melanoma. The invention allows countering the intrinsic and acquired resistance of melanoma cells with an activating BRAF mutation to specific BRAF inhibitors. BACKGROUND Melanoma incidence and mortality are high in United States and Europe and recent epidemiologic data documented increases of its incidence in the last few decades (Garbe and Leiter, 2009, Clin. Dermatol., 27, 3-9). Estimated age-standardized incidence varies widely in Europe from 19.2 (per 100,000 persons and year) in Switzerland to 2.2 in Greece (10.5 in Belgium), probably depending on opportunities for early diagnosis and incomplete reporting, while melanoma mortality rate of 1.5 is rather similar across Europe (Forsea et al., 2012, Br. J. Dermatol., 167, 1 124-1 130). The 5-year survival rate for patients with early detection of localized melanoma is about 90%, while it drops to 60% and 15% for patients with regional and distant metastases, respectively (Siegel et al., 2012, CA. Cancer J. Clin., 62, 220-241 ). Systemic treatment of metastatic melanoma is not always successful because of resistance to conventional chemotherapy. Dacarbazine, recorded by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in 1975, used to be, until recently, the standard for treatment of melanoma patients. It mainly induces partial responses in about 15% of all cases but without evidence of survival benefit (Serrone et al., 2000, J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. CR 19, 21 -34). No other monotherapy has yet been shown to be more effective than dacarbazine. It may also be used in combination with other cytotoxic agents such as cisplatine, carmustine or vinblastine, sometimes yielding higher response rates (30-50%). However, combined therapy is generally associated with greater toxicity and does not significantly increase survival (Lui et al., 2007, Cancer Treat. Rev., 33, 665-680). Recently, strategy restoring an immune system's response to disease has been also developed, in particular, with the ipilimumab, an antibody raised against CTLA-4 molecule on T-cells. Ipilimumab improved overall survival in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma. Furthermore, 9 of 15 responders (60%) in the ipilimumab only group maintained an objective response for at least 2 years (Hodi et al., 2010, N. Engl. J. Med., 363, 71 1 -723). Ipilimumab in combination with dacarbazine improved overall survival versus dacarbazine plus placebo in patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma (Robert et al., 201 1 , N . Engl. J. Med., 364, 2517-2526). Furthermore, a second immune therapy, an anti-PD1 antibody, produced objective responses in approximately 28% of patients with melanoma. In parallel, increased understanding of the molecular events involved in melanoma development has led to the identification of novel targets and to the development of new targeted agents. Gene alterations identified in melanoma pointed to distinct molecular subsets of tumors with direct implications in therapeutic strategies. Among these, activating BRAF mutations occurring in 50 to 60% of melanomas (Davies et al., 2002, Nature, 417, 949-954) (V600E substitution represents about 90% of BRAF mutations) and NRAS mutations in 15 to 25% of melanomas (mutually exclusive with BRAF mutation) opened new therapeutic perspectives targeting the MAPK pathway (hyperactivated in 75% of melanomas) with, among other, V600EBRAF or MEK inhibitors. Vemurafenib, the first V600EBRAF kinase inhibitor approved by the FDA in 201 1 , improved rates of overall and progression-free survival compared to dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated V600EBRAF melanoma (Chapman et al., 201 1 , N. Engl. J. Med., 364, 2507-2516). Dabrafenib, a second V600EBRAF inhibitor, produced promising tumor shrinkage in patients with mutant BRAF metastatic melanoma and particularly with melanoma brain metastases, a frequent complication of metastatic melanoma (Falchook et al., 2012, Lancet, 379, 1893-1901 ; Hauschild et al., 2012, Lancet, 380, 358-365). Trametinib, a selective inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, also improved rates of progression-free survival and overall survival versus chemotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma and V600E or V600K mutations in BRAF (Flaherty et al., 2012, N. Engl. J. Med., 367, 1694- 1703). With evidence of persistent MEK phosphorylation despite BRAF inhibition, dabrafenib has been combined with trametinib leading to improved response rates and median progression-free survival compared with treatment using dabrafenib alone (Flaherty et al., 2012, N. Engl. J. Med., 367, 1694-1703). Among new MEK inhibitors in clinical development, pimasertib has been recently reported to be particularly promising in the case of patients with mutant NRAS melanoma (Akinleye et al., 2013, J. Hematol. Oncol., 6, 27). Nevertheless, in spite of significant initial responses, resistance developed in almost all patients. Disease progression is observed in about 50% of patients on targeted therapy within 6 months of treatment initiation (Solit and Rosen, 201 1 , N . Engl. J . Med., 364, 772- 774). Recent studies reported multiple mechanisms for recurrences: switches between pathways (Chapman et al., 201 1 , N. Engl. J. Med., 364, 2507-2516), activation/stabilization of CRAF (Heidorn et al., 2010, Cell, 140, 209-221 ), COT/MAP3K8 activation (Johannessen et al., 2010, Nature, 468, 968-972), appearance of new activating mutations in C121SMEK1 (Wagle et al., 201 1 , J. Clin. Oncol., 29, 3085-3096), dimerization of aberrantly spliced V600EBRAF (Poulikakos et al., 201 1 , Nature, 480, 387-390), or upregulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (Nazarian et al., 2010, Nature, 468, 973-977). Therefore, further and/or improved treatment strategies are required to increase progression-free survival and improve complete response rates. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have unexpectedly realised that an agent capable of transferring wild type p53 from an inactive conformation thereof into an active conformation capable of inducing apoptosis sensitizes melanoma cells to an agent capable of inhibiting activity of BRAF comprising an activating mutation by breaking both intrinsic and acquired resistance. This fact can be advantageously exploited in various applications, including inter alia the treatment of melanoma. The inventors further demonstrated that said p53 reactivation may, in addition to its known proapoptotic activity, moderate PI3K AKT signaling, whose activation is a major resistance mechanism to vemurafenib. It is well documented that p53 is largely inactivated in melanoma by a variety of mechanisms, of which overexpression of MDM2 that currently is evaluated in the clinic as a target for therapy. However, in different mutant BRAF vemurafenib-resistant melanoma lines established by the inventors, MDM2 was only weakly expressed in one (MM 133), while MDM4 is detected in another (MM054), suggesting other mechanisms causing p53 inactivation may be present in BRAF mutated lines. The inventors have now established that direct p53 reactivation, whatever is the inhibition mechanism or mutational status, emerges as a promising treatment strategy. In such BRAF mutated cells, Ser15 phosphorylation may be viewed as a marker of functional reactivation of p53 and the upregulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN, the specific phosphatase coupled to the kinase PI3K and decreases the transcription of p1 10a, the catalytic subunit of PI3K, consequently inhibiting the AKT pathway. This was observed not only in melanoma cells with intrinsic resistance to vemurafenib but also in melanoma cell-lines that acquired resistance to vemurafenib (due to prolonged treatment with vemurafenib). Furthermore, the inventors compared p53-induced PI3K AKT inhibition to that of two different PI3K or PI3K mTOR inhibitors, each combined with vemurafenib. A clear advantage for the former in terms of growth inhibition and apoptosis promotion was shown in vemurafenib resistant melanoma cells, thus adding the benefit of inhibiting PI3K/AKT pathway to the known p53 effects on promoting apoptosis. In summary, the present invention highlights the potential clinical benefit of combining MAPK inhibition to p53 reactivation in BRAF mutated melanoma. Unexpectedly, from various combinatorial modalities tested, targeting the MAPK and PI3K, signaling pathways through p53 reactivation or not, the direct activation of p53 (such as through PRIMA-1 Met) in combination with BRAF inhibitor (such as through vemurafenib) was the most cytotoxic for resistant melanoma cells. Figure 23 shows a simplified scheme illustrating the effect of combined BRAF inhibitor and p53 reactivation on melanoma cell survival. Mutant BRAF is inhibited by vemurafenib while PI3K AKT pathway is inactivated by p53 activation using PRIMA-1 Met. In addition, p53 restoration induced apoptosis. Both drugs act in synergy to inhibit melanoma growth. Accordingly, the invention provides the following aspects: Aspect 1 .

The present invention offers a real opportunity to overcome both intrinsic and acquired resistance of melanoma to BRAF-inhibiting agents such as vemurafenib. Indeed, the data suggest that a combination of a BRAF inhibiting agent (such as vemurafenib) with a p53- activating agent (such as PRIMA-1 Met) allows breaking resistance to the BRAF-inhibiting agent. Melanoma primary cultures that can be established from patients, enabling studying the associated cellular mechanisms, can hence be viewed as tools for tailoring the treatment of the patient. In such a way, the drug or combination that has the best chance to be affective can be determined in vitro, outside the patient. Such a primary melanoma culture can be used to mimic and depict, in vitro, the escape pathways that the cells could switch on to survive the control mechanisms, long before the clinical situation actually occurs in the patient in vivo. It hence allows predicting the reaction of the melanoma cells towards the BRAF-inhibitors. These and further aspects and preferred embodiments of the invention are described in the following sections and in the appended claims. The subject-matter of the appended claims is hereby specifically incorporated in this specification.

It is to be understood that the value to which the modifier "about" refers is itself also specifically, and preferably, disclosed. Whereas the term "one or more", such as one or more members of a group of members, is clear per se, by means of further exemplification, the term encompasses inter alia a reference to any one of said members, or to any two or more of said members, such as, e.g., any >3, >4, >5, >6 or >7 etc. of said members, and up to all said members. All documents cited in the present specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Unless otherwise specified, all terms used in disclosing the invention, including technical and scientific terms, have the meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. By means of further guidance, term definitions may be included to better appreciate the teaching of the present invention. The term "p53" encompasses the tumor suppressor protein known as p53, or tumor protein 53, cellular tumor antigen p53, phosphoprotein p53, or tumor suppressor p53. It is a human protein encoded by the TP53 gene. It is a protein that is crucial in regulating the cell-cycle in all multicellular organisms. p53 can activate DNA repair proteins, it can arrest growth by holding the cell cycle at the G1/S regulation point on DNA damage recognition, and can induce apoptosis when the DNA damage is beyond repair. In many cancers, p53 is inactivated, either due to a mutation, or due to suppression through e.g. a viral oncogen, or through overexpression of another interacting protein. In the present invention, it was established that in many melanoma cells, that are, or become resistant to treatment with BRAF inhibitors, the p53 protein is not mutated (i.e., it is wild-type), but yet is suppressed or kept inactive. By combining the BRAF inhibiting agent with a p53 activator, this resistance is markedly reduced, ameliorating greatly the effect on the cancer cells. As defined herein, the term "p53-activating agent" or "p53 activator" encompasses all agents capable of transferring wild-type p53 from an inactive conformation into an active conformation which is capable of inducing apoptosis. This direct p53 reactivation whatever is the inhibition mechanism or mutational status, emerges as an alternative promising strategy. Some p53-binding molecules are known that not only rescue mutant p53 but also activate the function of wild-type p53 by affecting its conformation. The mechanism of p53 reactivation by these molecules is not completely understood, but it has been suggested that their binding to the DNA binding domain of p53 may induce its phosphorylation and a conformational block that prevents the docking of p53 inhibitors. Specific examples of such agents are compounds having the structure of Formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof, (I) wherein n is 0, 1 or 2; R1 and R2 are the same or different and are selected from -H, -CH2-R5, -CH2-0-R5, -CH2- S-R5, -CH2-NH-R5, -COO-R5, -CO-NH-R5, -CH2-NH-CO-R5, -CH2-0-CO-R5, -CH2-NH-CO- NHR5, -CH2-NH-CO-OR5, -CH2-NH-CS-NHR5 and -CH2-0-CO-NHR5; or R1 and R2 are together =CH2; R3 and R4 are the same or different and are selected from -H, -OH, -SH, -NH2, -NHR5 and -0-CO-C6H5; or R3 and R4 together are =0, =S, =NH or =NR5; R5 represents the same or different groups selected from H, substituted or non-substituted Ci-i0alkyl, C2-i0alkenyl, C2-i0alkynyl, substituted or non-substituted C3-i2cycloalkyl, substituted or non-substituted benzyl groups, substituted or non-substituted aryl or mono-, bi-, tricyclic unsubstituted or substituted heteroaromatic ring(s) with one or more heteroatoms and non-aromatic heterocycles wherein the substituents of the substituted groups are selected from Ci- i0alkyl, C2-i0alkenyl, C2-i0alkynyl, halogen, substituted or non- substituted aryl, substituted or non-substituted heteroaromatic compounds, non-aromatic heterocycles, Ci-i0alkyloxy, Ci-i0alkylamino, C2-i0alkenylamino, C2-i0alkynylamino, COR6, CONR6 and COOR6; R6 is selected from H, unsubstituted or substituted Ci_i0alkyl, C2-ioalkenyl or alkynyl, benzyl, aryl, unsubstituted or substituted heteroaromatic rings with one or more heteroatoms and non-aromatic heterocycles; R7 and R8 together form a bridging CH2-CH2 moiety; or R7 and R8 are both hydrogen. Further specific examples of p53 (re)activating agents as defined herein are: CDB3 (Issaeva N et al., 2003, Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 100(23): 13303-13307); SCH529074 (Demma M, et al., 2010, J Biol Chem. 285(14): 10198-10212); CP-31398 (Luu Y and Li G, 2002, J Invest Dermatol, 1 19(5):1207-1209; Luu Y et al., 2002 Exp Cell Res, 276(2):214- 222.) and a member of the thiosemicarbazone family such as NSC319726, NSC319725, and NSC328784, preferably NSC319726 (Yu X. et al., 2012, Cancer Cell. 15;21 (5):614- 25). The term "BRAF" or "BRAF protein" as used herein refers to the human protein B-Raf, encoded by human gene BRAF. The gene is also referred to as proto-oncogene B-Raf, and v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 . The protein is also known as serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf. B-Raf is a 766-amino acid protein comprising three conserved Raf kinase domains: a Ras-GTP-binding self-regulatory domain (CR1 ), a serine-rich hinge region (CR2), and a catalytic protein kinase domain (CR3) phosphorylating protein substrates such as the AKT-1 protein. The BRAF protein is a member of the Raf kinase family of growth signal transduction protein kinases and is involved in regulating the MAP kinase/ERK signaling pathways involved in (amongst others) cell proliferation and cell differentiation. The BRAF protein is tightly regulated in normal cells, but can be mutated in cancerous cells, such as melanoma. In 90% of such cases, said mutation leads to a valine (V) being substituted by another amino acid at codon 600 (V600-mutant) of the amino acid sequence of BRAF. Examples are e.g. valine substitutions by glutamate (E) or lysine (K), resulting in respectively V600E and V600K BRAF mutants. These mutations leads to a constitutive active BRAF protein, referred herein as "mutated BRAF protein comprising an activating mutation" or "BRAF comprising an activating mutation". The term "BRAF-inhibiting agent" or "BRAF inhibitor", as used herein, encompasses all compounds, agents, or compositions that are capable of inhibiting the activity of the mutated BRAF protein comprising an activating mutation as defined herein. Exemplary agents are: Vemurafenib (/V-(3-{[5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1 /-/-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-3- yl]carbonyl}-2,4-difluorophenyl) propane-1 -sulfonamide, Zelboraf, PLX4032), or its analogues as defined by Formula II I as taught herein, and PLX4720 (N-[3-(5-chloro-1 H- pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine-3-carbonyl)-2,4-difluorophenyl]propane-1 -sulfonamide), both adenine-analogs, binding the ATP binding site of (over)activated BRAF, not of inactive BRAF. This selectivity is important, since the agent will normally only inhibit proliferation of cells with unregulated (over)active BRAF, i.e. in cancer cells. Alternative BRAF inhibitors can be selected from the group consisting of GDC-0879 ((£)-2,3-Dihydro-5-[1 -(2- hydroxyethyl)-3-(4-pyridinyl)-1 /-/-pyrazol-4-yl]-1 /-/-inden-1 -one oxime), Sorafenib (4-[4-[[4- chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]carbamoylamino]phenoxy]-/V-methyl-pyridine-2- carboxamide, Nexavar, BAY43-9006, tosylated or not).

As used herein, the term "melanoma" refers to cancer of melanocytes or a malignant tumor of melanocytes. The term "melanocytes" refers to cells which produce dark pigment, melanin, which is responsible for the colour of skin. Melanocytes predominantly occur in skin, but are also found in other parts of the body, including the bowel and the eye. Melanoma may originate in any part of the body that contains melanocytes. As used herein, the term "cancer" refers to a malignant neoplasm characterized by deregulated or unregulated cell growth. As used herein, the terms "tumor" or "tumor tissue" refer to an abnormal mass of tissue that results from excessive cell division. A tumor or tumor tissue comprises "tumor cells" which are neoplastic cells with abnormal growth properties and no useful bodily function. Tumors, tumor tissue and tumor cells may be benign, pre-malignant or malignant, or may represent a lesion without any cancerous potential. A tumor or tumor tissue may also comprise "tumor-associated non-tumor cells", e.g., vascular cells which form blood vessels to supply the tumor or tumor tissue. Non-tumor cells may be induced to replicate and develop by tumor cells, for example, the induction of angiogenesis in a tumor or tumor tissue. As used herein, the term "malignant" refers to a non-benign tumor. Generally, melanoma may be classified in one of the following stages: Stage 0: This refers to melanoma in situ, which means melanoma cells are found only in the epidermis (the outer layer of skin). This stage of melanoma has virtually no metastatic potential, which means it is very unlikely that it will spread to other parts of the body. Stage I: The melanoma is still only in the skin and is very thin. Stage IA melanoma is 1 .0 mm or thinner and has no ulceration. Stage IB may describe a melanoma that is the same thickness but has ulceration or a melanoma that is slightly thicker (between 1 .1 mm and 2.0 mm) with no ulceration. Stage II: Stage II melanoma is thicker than stage I melanoma, extending through the epidermis and into the dermis (dense inner layer of the skin), and it has a slightly higher chance of spreading. Stage II is divided into three smaller groups - A, B, or C - depending on how thick the melanoma is and whether or not there is ulceration. Stage III: This stage describes melanoma that has spread through the lymphatic system (part of the immune system and drains fluid from body tissues through a series of tubes) either to a regional lymph node (lymph nodes near where the cancer started) or to a skin site on the way to a lymph node ("in-transit metastasis"). Stage III is also divided into substages - A, B, or C - depending on the size and number of lymph nodes involved with melanoma. Stage IV: This stage describes melanoma that has spread through the bloodstream to other, distant parts of the body, such as the lung, liver, brain, bone, or gastrointestinal tract. Stage IV is further divided into M1 a (metastasis only to the skin and/or soft tissue sites), M1 b (metastasis to the lung), and M1 c (metastasis anywhere else). Recurrent: Recurrent melanoma is melanoma that has come back after treatment. If there is a recurrence, the cancer may need to be staged again (re-staging). The term "metastatic" or "metastasis" generally refers to the spread of a cancer from one organ or tissue to another non-adjacent organ or tissue. In certain embodiments, the melanoma may be lentigo maligna, lentigo maligna melanoma, superficial spreading melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, mucosal melanoma, nodular melanoma, polypoid melanoma, desmoplastic melanoma, amelanotic melanoma, or soft-tissue melanoma. Term "lentigo melanoma" generally refers to a melanoma in situ that consists of malignant cells but does not show invasive growth. The terms "lentigo melanoma" and "lentiginous melanoma on sun-damaged skin" may be used interchangeably. The term "lentigo maligna melanoma" generally refers to a melanoma that has evolved from a lentigo maligna. The term "superficial spreading melanoma", "superficially spreading melanoma", or "SSM" generally refers to cutaneous melanoma in Caucasians. Often, SSM evolves from a precursor lesion, usually a dysplastic nevus. Otherwise it arises in previously normal skin. The microscopic hallmarks may include: large melanocytic cells with nest formation along the dermo-epidermal junction; invasion of the upper epidermis in a pagetoid fashion (discohesive single cell growth); the pattern of rete ridges is often effaced; invasion of the dermis by atypical, pleomorphic melanocytes; absence of the maturation typical of nevus cells; and mitoses. The term "acral lentiginous melanoma" generally refers to a kind of lentiginous skin melanoma. Typical signs of acral lentiginous melanoma may include longitudinal tan, black, or brown streak on a finger or toe nail (melanonychia striata), pigmentation of proximal nail fold, and areas of dark pigmentation on palms of hands or soles of feet.

The above aspects and embodiments are further supported by the following non-limiting examples. EXAMPLES Material and Methods Effectors The V600EBRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 were from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). The PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor PF-04691502 and the p53 activator PRIMA-1 Met were from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). They were dissolved, according to the manufacturer's recommendations, in DMSO (vemurafenib, LY294002 and PF-04691502) or water (PRIMA-1 Met) at 10"2 M, aliquoted and stored at - 20° C. Melanoma cell lines A panel of nine human melanoma cell lines, derived from different metastatic sites, were all established in the "Laboratoire d'Oncologie et de Chirurgie Experimentale", Universite Libre de Bruxelles (Krayem M et al., 2014, Eur J Cancer Oxf Engl 1990, Vol.50(7):1310- 1320 ; Gembarska A et al., 2012 Nat Med.Vol. 18(8):1239-1247). The BRAF, NRAS, TP53 and PTEN mutation status have been evaluated with the next-generation DNA sequencing for 48 genes from cancer panel (TruSeq Amplicon - Cancer Panel, lllumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and summarized in Table 1 . Cell culture conditions Cells were grown in HAM-F10 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated foetal calf serum, 5% heat-inactivated new-born calf serum and with L-glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin at standard concentrations (all from Gibco, Invitrogen, UK) (culture medium) at 37°C in a humidified 95% air and 5% C02 atmosphere. For routine maintenance, cells were propagated in flasks, harvested by trypsinization (0.05% trypsin-EDTA) (Gibco) and subcultured twice weekly. Cells were counted using a TC10™ Automated Cell Counter (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). All cell lines are regularly checked for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert® Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza, Rockland, ME, USA). Cell proliferation assay Cell proliferation was assessed by crystal violet assay (Krayem M et al., 2014, Eur J Cancer Oxf Engl 1990, Vol.50(7):1310- 1320). All cells were seeded in 96-well plates (8x103 cells/well) in complete medium (day -1 ). One day after plating (day 0), the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium containing effectors or inhibitors or not depending on experimental conditions, and cells were cultured for 1 additional day (day 1 ) or 3 additional days (day 3). Culture medium was removed and cells were gently rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 1 % glutaraldehyde/PBS for 15 minutes and stained with 0.1 % crystal violet (w/v in water) for 30 minutes. Cells were distained under running tap water and subsequently lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 90 minutes (v/v in water). The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a Multiskan EX Microplate Photometer (Thermo Scientific, Courtaboeuf Cedex, France). On each plate, blank wells containing medium alone were used to estimate background. Apoptosis determination Apoptotic cell was determined by using Annexin V : PE Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen, Erembodegem, Belgium), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (2x105 cells/well) in culture medium. One day after plating, the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium containing or not effectors and cells were further incubated for 2 days. Then, culture medium was collected and cells were harvested by trypsinization and mixed with the culture medium collection. Cells were pelleted by brief centrifugation (200 g, 5 minutes) and suspended in 100 μΙ 1 x Binding Buffer (BD Pharmingen). After addition of 5 μΙ annexin V-FITC and 5 μΙ 7-amino- actinomycin (7-AAD), cell suspensions were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature and in the dark. Finally, cells were diluted with 400 μΙ 1 x Binding Buffer and analyzed with a flow cytometrer (FACS Calibur, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) within 1 hour. Western blot analysis Cells were plated in Petri dishes (3x106 cells/dish) in culture medium. One day after plating, the culture medium was replaced by a fresh one and further left for 2 days. Then, cells were exposed or not to effectors for 30 minutes or 24 hours. Cells were lysed using a detergent cocktail (M-PER Mammalian Extraction Buffer) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) and phosphatase inhibitors (Halt Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail) (all from Pierce, Rockford, I L, USA). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Equal amounts of extracted proteins (35 μg) were subjected to 10 or 12% SDS- PAGE and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using iBIot® Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Gent, Belgium). Immunodetections were performed using antibodies raised against V600EBRAF (VE1 , 1 /1000) (from Spring Bioscience, Pleasanton, CA, USA), pBRAF (Ser 445) (1/1000), pCRAF (Ser 338) (1/1000), CRAF (1 /1000), p1 10a (C73F8, 1 /1000), PTEN (138G6, 1 /1000), pAKT (Ser 473) (D9E, 1 /500), AKT (40D4, 1/1000), p21 (12D1 , 1/1000) and p53 Ser15 (16G8) (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), BRAF (F-7, 1/200), pERK (Tyr 204) (E-4, 1 /1000), ERK2 (C-14, 1/2000), p53 (DO-1 , 1 /200) and MDM2 (SMP14, 1 /200) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), and MDM4 (8C6, 1/1000), D-actin (C4, 1 /5000) (from Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA). Peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1 /5000) or peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (1 /5000) (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Roosendaal, The Netherlands) were used as secondary reagents to detect corresponding primary antibodies. Bound peroxidase activity was revealed using the SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce) following the manufacturer's indications. Immunostaining signals were digitalized with a PC-driven LAS- 3000 CCD camera (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan), using a software specifically designed for image acquisition (Image Reader, Raytest®, Straubenhardt, Germany). Immunoreactive band intensities were quantified using the software AIDA® Image Analyser 3.45 (Raytest®). Human melanoma xenografts Five to six week old female nude (nu/nu) mice weighing 17-21 g were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Saint Aubin les Elbeuf, France). Mice were injected subcutaneously (right and left flank) with 5x106 MM074 (vemurafenib sensitive), MM043 (with intrinsic resistance) or MM074-R cells (with acquired resistance) in 200 μΙ of 50% Matrigel (from Trevigen, Gaithersburg, Maryland) in saline. When tumors reached 200 mm3, mice were randomized into groups of 8 and daily intraperitoneally injected with vehicle, 45 mg/kg vemurafenib, 50 mg/kg PRI MA-1 Met or vemurafenib plus PRIMA-1 Met. Tumor size and body weight were measured every two days. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula (LxWxW)/2 (Ji Z et al., 2013, Clin Cancer Res Off J Am Assoc Cancer Res. 19(16):4383-4391 ), in which L is the length and W is the width as measured with a vernier calliper. The experiments were performed in accordance with the European Union Guidelines and validated by the local Animal Ethics Evaluation Committee (CEBEA protocol: 500N). Statistical analysis The IC50 and IC10 values represent the inhibitory concentrations producing, respectively, 50% and 10% growth reduction and were calculated from dose response curves using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). All data are expressed as means ± SD of at least three independent experiments; statistical significance was measured by Student's t-test (* p<0.05, ** p<0.01 , *** p<0.001 ) using GraphPad Prism software. Differences in tumor volumes and body weight among groups of treated mice were tested using two-way ANOVA; values are presented as means ± SEM. Combination index calculation The synergistic effect was analyzed by the multiple drug-effect equation and quantified by the combination index (CI) using CalcuSyn software version 2.1 (Biosoft, UK) 39,40. CI values between 0.9 and 1 .1 indicates an additive effect; values between 0.7 and 0.9, a moderate synergism; values lower than 0.7, a strong synergism; and antagonism is represented by CI values higher than 1 .1 . Example 1 : Effect of vemurafenib on BRAF melanoma cells lines sensitive to vemurafenib or V600EBRAF melanoma cells lines with intrinsic resistance to vemurafenib The present inventors have established more than 100 melanoma cell lines from human melanoma metastases. More than 20 lines were characterized inter alia with regard to proliferation rate, key mRNA expression, key protein expression and/or activity, BRAF/NRAS/cKIT/MC1 R/p53 mutations, and response to various inhibitors/effectors. The effect of vemurafenib on a panel of nine V600E/KBRAF melanoma cell lines was evaluated. Six cell lines were found to be sensitive (IC50 < 2μη"ΐ) and five cell lines were found to be resistant (IC50 > 10μΜ) to vemurafenib (S0ndergaard JN et al., 2010, J Transl Med. 8(1 ):39; Tap WD et al., 2010, Neoplasia N Y N. 12(8):637-649), as shown in Table 1 .

Apoptosis of the cell line sensitive to vemurafenib (MM074) and the cell line resistant to vemurafenib (MM043) was determined by using Annexin V : PE Apoptosis Detection Kit I, as described herein. The results are given in Figure 2. These data clearly indicate that vemurafenib induces apoptosis in sensitive cells (Ιΰ50<10μΜ) while no apoptosis is detected in resistant ones (Ιΰ50≥10μΜ) (Figures 1 and 2). Thus, the mechanism of sensitivity of melanoma cells to vemurafenib may be associated with the induction of apoptosis. The present inventors found, by comparing various key pathway effectors between the cell line sensitive to vemurafenib (MM074) and the cell line resistant to vemurafenib (MM043), that intrinsic resistance is associated with high AKT phosphorylation, low PTEN, and low p53 expression, while similar inhibitions of ERK phosphorylation were achieved in both lines (Figure 3A, left panels: MM074; right panels: MM043). Example 2: Effect of combination of vemurafenib and the p53 activator PRIMA-1 Met on V600EBRAF melanoma cells lines sensitive to vemurafenib or V600EBRAF melanoma cells lines with intrinsic resistance to vemurafenib The present inventors realized that PI3K inhibition and/or PTEN upregulation can effectively decrease the phosphorylation of AKT and can potentiate the effect of vemurafenib in resistant cells. One possibility to stimulate PTEN and inhibit PI3K is to restore p53 expression and/or activity (Stambolic et al., 2001 , Mol. Cell., 8, 317-325; Astanehe et al., 2008, J. Cell Sci., 121 , 664-74). PRIMA-1 Met is a drug which increases the transcriptional activity of both mutant and wild type p53 (Bao et al. , 201 1 , Cell Cycle, 10, 301 -307). The present inventors have studied the effect of the combination of vemurafenib (Vemu) and PRIMA-1 Met on V600EBRAF melanoma cells lines sensitive to vemurafenib (MM074) or V600EBRAF melanoma cells lines with intrinsic resistance to vemurafenib (MM043). The effect of the combination of vemurafenib with PRIMA-1 Met on cell proliferation of sensitive (MM074) and intrinsically resistant (MM043) cells to vemurafenib are presented in Figure 4. PRIMA-1 Met induced an impressive sensitization of the resistant cells to vemurafenib with a decrease of the IC50 of these resistant cells by about 20 folds (MM043, Figure 4, right panel). By contrast, no additional significant effect of PRI MA-1 Met was observed in vemurafenib sensitive cells (MM074, Figure 4, left panel). The present inventors also examined apoptosis (Annexin V : PE Apoptosis Detection Kit I , BD Bioscience) in vemurafenib sensitive (MM074) and intrinsically resistant (MM043) cells to vemurafenib (Figure 5). Vemurafenib and PRIMA-1 Met combination induced an important increase of apoptosis in cells with intrinsic resistance to vemurafenib compared with treatment with vemurafenib or PRIMA-1 Met alone (MM043, Figure 5, right panel). Only, a marginal effect was observed in vemurafenib sensitive cells (MM074, Figure 5, left panel). By comparing pathway effectors between sensitive (MM074) and intrinsically resistant (MM043) cells to vemurafenib, the present inventors found that treatment with PRIMA-1 Met restored p53 expression, stimulated PTEN expression and, consequently, inhibited AKT phosphorylation in cells with intrinsic resistance to vemurafenib (Figure 6, bottom panels: MM043). By contrast, no significant effect was observed on p53 expression in vemurafenib sensitive cells (Figure 6, top panels: MM074). Example 3: Effect of combination of vemurafenib and the p53 activator PRIMA-1 on V600EBRAF melanoma cells lines with acquired resistance to vemurafenib The MM074 cell line was made resistant (MM074-R) by a chronic exposure (12 weeks) to increasing concentrations (0.1 μΜ, 0.2 μΜ, 0.5 μΜ, 1 μΜ, and 2 μΜ) of vemurafenib (Figure 7). The results of cell proliferation of both parental and resistant cell lines are presented in Figure 8. A 20-fold increase of IC50 occurs in cells with acquired resistance to vemurafenib compared to the sensitive/parental ones (Figure 8, MM074: dashed line, MM074-R: full line). By comparing pathway effectors between vemurafenib sensitive (MM074) and cells with acquired resistance (MM074-R), the latter was found associated with high AKT phosphorylation, low PTEN, and low p53 expression (Figure 9, left panels: MM074; right panels: MM074-R). These important data indicate that the resistance could be acquired through the downregulation of p53. In order to break the acquired resistance by upregulating p53, PRIMA-1 Met was used in combination with vemurafenib. The results of such combination on cell proliferation of cells with acquired resistance to vemurafenib (MM074-R) are presented in Figure 10 showing a 10 fold decrease of IC50. Moreover, the combination of vemurafenib with PRI MA-1 Met induces a dramatic increase of apoptosis in cells with acquired resistance to vemurafenib compared with treatment with vemurafenib or PRI MA-1 Met alone (Figure 1 1 ). Apoptosis was determined using Annexin V : PE Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences). Importantly, it was observed that both intrinsic resistance (MM043, Figure 4) and acquired resistance (MM074-R, Figure 10) are very significantly reversed by p53 activation/upregulation using PRIMA-1 Met. The activation of p53 was systematically accompanied by an increase of PTEN expression and a consequent inhibition of AKT phosphorylation. Therefore, the data strongly suggest that sensitivity to vemurafenib requires an active crosstalk between V600EBRAF/MEK/ERK and PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathways leading to PTEN increase, while in resistant cells, such an effect can only be obtained by a concomitant V600EBRAF inhibition and PTEN stimulation best achieved by direct or indirect restoration of p53 intracellular levels. Example 4: Direct reactivation of p53 by PRIMA-1 sensitizes resistant cells to vemurafenib The five vemurafenib resistant melanoma lines were screened to their sensitivity to a combination of vemurafenib and PRIMA-1 Met. The latter was used at fixed concentrations (IC10) based on proliferation assays performed with PRIMA-1 Met alone and ranging from 20 to 40 μΜ depending on cell lines (data not shown). Importantly, we observed a strong synergistic effect on both cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis induction (cf. Figure 12 for comparison of the vemu-sensitive cell-line MM074,with the 5 vemu-resistant cell-lines and cf. "CI" in Table 1 ) with significant IC50s decrease in each case. As mechanisms that reactivate the MAPK and AKT pathways are commonly involved in resistance to oncogenic BRAF inhibitors, we evaluated the effect of vemurafenib for 24 hours on ERK and AKT phosphorylation and found that pERK was similarly inhibited in a concentration- dependent manner by the drug in all resistant lines, while pAKT was unaffected in three out of five resistant lines (MM032, MM043 and MM 133) (Figure 13). The direct p53 reactivation by Prima-1 Met was the best choice in all cell lines because the indirect reactivation through MDM2 or 4 would have been possible only in two. Indeed, In the five mutant BRAF vemurafenib-resistant melanoma lines, MDM2 was only weakly expressed in one (MM 133), while MDM4 is detected in another (MM054) (Figure 14) In order to investigate the mechanism underlying the synergistic effect of the vemurafenib/PRI MA-1 Met combination, we singled out two lines with varying sensitivity to this combination, one sensitive (MM074) and one resistant (MM043) (Figure 15 A). Of note, when comparing these two lines, we found that resistant cells had higher levels of p1 10-alpha (the catalytic subunit of PI3K) as well as pAKT and lower expression levels of both PTEN and p53 (Figure 15 B), possibly explaining its higher sensitivity to PRIMA-1 Met in the combination assay. We evaluated the concentration-dependent effect of vemurafenib on the same parameters and found that pERK was similarly inhibited by the drug in both sensitive and resistant lines (Figure 16 A). Moreover, in the sensitive cells, pAKT was strongly inhibited and accompanied by a concentration-dependent increase of PTEN expression while, in the resistant ones, neither AKT phosphorylation nor PTEN expression were affected even at drug concentration as high as 10 μΜ (Figure 16 B). These data suggest that the loss of an active crosstalk between BRAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathways may affect the sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor and confirm that a sustained activation of the PI3K AKT pathway confers resistance to vemurafenib (Atefi M et al., 201 1 , PLoS ONE, 6(12):e28973; Gopal YNV et al., 2014, Cancer Res. 74(23)7037-7047; Su F et al., 2012, Cancer Res. 72(4):969-978.). Example 5: Reactivation of p53 by PRIMA-1 Met is associated with p1 10a/AKT inhibition and PTEN upregulation As PI3K and PTEN are both p53 targets (Astanehe A et al., 2008, J Cell Sci. 121 (Pt 5):664-674; Stambolic V et al., 2001 , Mol Cell. 8(2):317-325.), p53 reactivation may inhibit PI3K/AKT pathway and contribute to apoptosis promotion. We first checked this hypothesis by exposing both sensitive (MM074) and resistant (MM043) cells to 25 and 50 μΜ PRIMA-1 Met, and observed the activation of the p53 pathway (phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and stimulation of p21 expression), an increase in PTEN levels as well as an inhibition of p1 10a expression and AKT phosphorylation (Figure 17 A). Importantly, exposure to PRI MA-1 Met led to a 200-fold decrease in IC50 to vemurafenib in the resistant line (Figure 17 C, Table 1 ) and a more modest (2 -fold) but significant decrease in the sensitive one (Figure 17 B, Table 1 ). Example 6: Synergistic inhibition of melanoma cell growth by combining mutant BRAF and selective PI3K/mTOR inhibitors In order to compare the cytotoxic effect of p53 reactivation with PI3K AKT/mTOR inhibition on vemuraf en ib-exposed cells, we used two different specific inhibitors of the PI3K/AKT pathway, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor PF-04691502, and examined cell proliferation and apoptosis. We first established that the IC10s of both sensitive (MM074) and resistant (MM043) melanoma lines to LY294002 and PF-04691502 were, respectively, 5 and 0.1 μΜ. AKT phosphorylation was inhibited at those concentrations (Figure 18 A) that were used in combination with increasing concentrations of vemurafenib. In sensitive cells, proliferation was not significantly affected (Figure 18 B), but apoptosis was increased (Figure 18 D), while, in resistant ones, a significant synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation (IC50 more than 12-fold lower, CI were 0.64 for PF-04691502 and 0.56 for LY294002) (Figure 18 C) and a significant increase in apoptosis (Figure 18 E) were observed. This further supports that the resistance to vemurafenib is effectively due to an activated PI3K/AKT pathway in the MM043 line. Notably, this synergistic effect remains by far lower than the one observed above when combining vemurafenib and PRI MA-1 Met. Example 7: p53 reactivation overcomes acquired resistance to vemurafenib Acquired resistance has been obtained in the vemurafenib sensitive line MM074 by a 12- week of exposure to gradually increasing concentrations (0.1 -2 μ Μ) of the drug. Acquired resistance to vemurafenib translated into a 210-fold increase of IC50 in resistant cells (MM074-R) as compared to parental cells (MM074) (Figure 19 A, Table 1 ). The resistance was associated with a significant downregulation of p53, p21 and PTEN levels along with a substantial increase in p1 10a expression and consequently AKT phosphorylation (Figure 19 B). We determined IC10s for both PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (5 μΜ LY294002, 0.1 μΜ PF- 04691502) or p53 activator (40 μΜ PRI MA-1 Met) in MM074-R. Of the latter, only PRIMA- 1 Met could very significantly affect cell proliferation (Figure 19 C), reporting a 10-fold lower IC50 (Table 1 , CI was 0.05) associated with a massive induction of apoptosis (Figure 19 D) when combined to vemurafenib. This was preceded by a dose-dependent increase of p53 expression and phosphorylation, upregulation of p21 and PTEN levels and decrease of p1 10a expression and AKT phosphorylation (Figure 19 E). Example 8: In vivo effect of combination of vemurafenib and the p53 activator PRIMA-1 Met on V600EBRAF melanoma cells line with intrinsic resistance to vemurafenib The effect of vemurafenib and PRIMA-1 Met alone and in combination was evaluated on xenograft growth of the resistant MM043 cells (4 groups: control, vemurafenib, PRIMA- 1 Met, and vemurafenib + PRIMA-1 Met). 107 cells were implanted (by injection) in Swiss nudes (10 mice per experimental condition). Tumor growth was monitored over 3 weeks to reach 5-8 mm diameter. Then, effectors were intraperitoneally (I P) administered daily by I P injection (45 mg/kg vemurafenib and/or 50 mg/kg PRIMA-1 Met). The tumor volume was measured every 2 days for 3 weeks. At the end of experiments, all mice were sacrificed. Tumors and residual lesions will be embedded into paraffin for further IHC analyses (p53, PTEN and pAKT). This first animal study validated the in vitro observations. The data indicate that only the combination of vemurafenib and PRIMA-1 Met caused tumor regression and was more effective to inhibit tumor growth when compared with vemurafenib or PRIMA-1 Met alone (Figure 20). Example 9: PRIMA-1 Met and vemurafenib synergize to inhibit the growth of vemurafenib-resistant melanoma xenografts The effect of vemurafenib and PRI MA-1 alone and in combination was evaluated on the in vivo growth of the vemurafenib-resistant MM043 and MM074-R melanoma cells. The sensitive melanoma cells (MM074) xenografts were used as control. After subcutaneous cell injection, tumor growth was monitored to reach volumes of about 200 mm3. Then, effectors were daily intraperitoneal^ administered (45 mg/kg vemurafenib and/or 50 mg/kg PRI MA-1 Met). We used doses of vemurafenib and PRIMA-1 Met that, alone, did not cause any major inhibition of tumor growth. In vemurafenib-sensitive (MM074) xenografts, vemurafenib alone inhibited tumor growth as of day 4 after starting treatment. The average tumor volume in control animals treated with vehicule (DMSO) for 28 days was -1425 mm3 (n=10), while it was -190 mm3 for animals that received vemurafenib (Figure 21 A). In intrinsically vemurafenib-resistant (MM043) xenografts, the mean tumor volumes in animals treated with vehicle, vemurafenib and PRIMA-1 Met were, respectively, -1410 mm3 after 20 days, -1 130 mm3 after 28 days and 1080 mm3 after 20 days of treatment. Compared to each effector alone, vemurafenib and PRIMA-1 Met combination produced a complete suppression of tumor growth starting at day 8 after treatment initiation comparable to that observed in sensitive cells. With the combination, the average tumor volume significantly dropped to -220 mm3 after 28 days of treatment (Figure 21 B). Of note, vemurafenib alone did not significantly affected tumor growth. In MM074-R xenografts with acquired resistance to vemurafenib, only vemurafenib and PRIMA-1 Met combination could efficiently suppress tumor growth over the whole period of treatment of 36 days (Figure 21 C). No significant difference in body weight was observed in all three conditions indicating that these treatment regimens did not lead to overall toxicity (Figure 21 D-F). Example 10: Phase I clinical study of the combination regimen of vemurafenib and the p53 activator PRIMA-1 Met on V600EBRAF melanoma cells lines Based on the aforementioned in vitro data and animal in vivo data, a phase l/l I clinical trial is initiated combining vemurafenib and PRIMA-1 Met in melanoma patients who do not respond to vemurafenib. Stage IV melanoma patients > 17 years, with metastases harboring the mutant V600E/KBRAF (as detected by Cobas, Roche and validated by I HC using VE-1 antibody), progressive or having presented a non-heterogeneous response after four weeks of vemurafenib as assessed by 2-fluorodeoxy-D-glucose Positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) using guidelines developed at our institution (Hendlisz et al., 2012, Ann. Oncol., 23, 1687-1693), are proposed to be included in the clinical study (Figure 22). Before vemurafenib treatment initiation and when possible, one cutaneous or lymph node metastasis is removed for further lab studies. The tumor tissue is split into 3 parts: the first part is paraffin-embedded for pathological evaluation (e.g., mutational status), the second part is used to establish primary cultures (e.g., to determine intrinsic and acquired resistance and its underlying mechanism), and the third part is snap frozen for translational research. A second metastatic tissue is collected at the time of cancer progression. Half of the second metastatic tissue is paraffin-embedded for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and sequencing, and the other half is snap frozen for translational research (e.g., kinome profiling). The clinical study can provide further insight in the effect of the combination of vemurafenib and PRIMA-1 Met in melanoma patients with resistance to vemurafenib. Example 11 : In vitro diagnostic model to predict sensitivity or resistance of patients to vemurafenib alone or in combination with PRIMA-1 Met The present inventors have developed an in vitro diagnostic model to predict responsiveness (sensitivity or resistance) of patients to vemurafenib alone or in combination with PRIMA-1 Met. For each patient included in the trial, a cell line is established (when possible) according to standard protocols and QC (Morandini et al., 1998, J. Cell. Physiol., 175, 276-282). To speed-up the process, tumor cell enrichment techniques (fibroblast depletion, MACS Miltenyl Biotec) are performed and melanoma cells are characterized by immunocytochemistry (ICC) for Melan-A (melanocyte lineage marker) and V600EBRAF expression. This step is preferably performed within one month of sampling. Cytotoxicity of vemurafenib and PRIMA-1 Met is assessed by crystal violet staining and apoptosis assay to calculate IC50 and IC10. The latter is used for drug combination studies. The result reflects a prediction of the response in the corresponding patient (from whom the culture is derived). The next step is a validation step correlating the extent of sensitivity or resistance of cells and objective clinical responses in patients. If the cells are found intrinsically resistant to vemurafenib, p53, PTEN and pAKT expression is examined by ICC to explore the possibility to combine vemurafenib with PRIMA-1 Met and use it in the patient. If cells are sensitive to vemurafenib, IC50 value is calculated and cells are subjected to a chronic treatment (12 weeks) with increasing drug concentrations (0.1 -2 μΜ) in order to develop acquired resistance. When done, a specific profile often associated with resistance is searched for: low p53, low PTEN, and high pAKT. Next, various vemurafenib and PRIMA-1 Met combinations are tested in order to propose the appropriate combination and dosing to the corresponding patient (from whom the culture is derived). The scheme is shown in Figure 23.
