CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/438,086, filed on Jan. 31, 2011, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field The present disclosure relates to a clip applier. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a drive assembly for actuating a jaw assembly of a clip applier. 2. Description of Related Art Surgical clip appliers are known in the art and have increased in popularity among surgeons by offering an alternative to conventional suturing of body tissues and vessels. Typical instruments are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,030,226 to Green et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,431,668 to Burbank, III et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,271 to Whitfield et al. These instruments generally provide a plurality of clips which are stored in the instrument and which are fed sequentially to the jaw mechanism at the distal end of the instrument upon opening and closing of the handles at the proximal end of the instrument. As the handles are closed, the jaws close to deform a clip positioned between the jaw members, and as the jaws are opened to release the deformed clip, a new clip is fed from the series to a position between the jaws. This process is repeated until all the clips in the series of clips have been used. Although current clip appliers are effective in applying clips to blood vessels and other various kinds of ducts, it would be beneficial and desirable to provide an endoscopic clip applier having a driving assembly that engages the jaw members in a more secure fashion, for example, to prevent disengagement of the drive assembly from the jaw assembly and/or to prevent clips from twisting during application of the clip. SUMMARY The present disclosure relates to an apparatus for endoscopic application of surgical clips to body tissue. The apparatus includes a handle portion, an elongated tubular member, one or more surgical clips, a jaw assembly and a locking cam driver. The elongated tubular member extends distally from the handle portion and defines a longitudinal axis. The surgical clips are disposed within the tubular member. The jaw assembly includes first and second jaw members that are mounted at a distal end of the elongated tubular member, and define a plane therebetween. Each of the first and second jaw members includes a raised element that has an angled camming surface. The jaw assembly is movable between a spaced, open position and an approximated, substantially closed position. The locking cam driver includes a bifurcated distal end portion that has a pair of angled camming surfaces. Each of the angled camming surfaces of the locking cam driver is substantially complementary of a respective angled camming surface of the jaw assembly. Further, each of the angled camming surfaces of the locking cam driver is configured to engage a corresponding angled camming surface of the jaw assembly to move the first and second jaw members from the spaced, open position to the approximated, substantially closed position to thereby form a surgical clip. In embodiments, the locking cam driver may be disposed adjacent to a distal portion of the jaw assembly to cam the jaw members from the spaced, open position to the approximated, substantially closed position. In other embodiments, the bifurcated distal end portion of the locking cam driver may define a U-shaped space therebetween to gradually cam the first and second jaw members within the locking cam driver upon distal movement thereof. Each of the angled camming surfaces of the jaw assembly may be disposed on the outer edge of each of the raised elements. Each of the angled camming surfaces of the jaw assembly and the locking cam driver may define a predetermined angle (e.g., an acute angle) relative to the plane defined by the first and second jaw members. In embodiments, each of the predetermined angles of the angled camming surfaces of the jaw assembly may face toward an outer edge of the jaw assembly and each of the predetermined angles of the angled camming surfaces of the locking cam driver may face toward a center portion of the locking cam driver. The raised elements may be wider at a distal portion of the jaw members than at a proximal portion of the jaw members so that progressive distal movement of the locking cam driver cams jaw members towards an approximated, closed position. The angled camming surfaces of locking cam driver and the angled camming surfaces of the jaw assembly may facilitate interlocking of the locking cam driver and the jaw assembly during actuation, and the locking cam driver is drawn towards the jaw assembly to provide greater closure force. In embodiments, the angle of the angled camming surfaces of the locking cam driver may be different than the angle of the angled camming surfaces of the jaw assembly to provide an offset angled configuration. In other embodiments, the angle of the angled camming surfaces of the locking cam driver may define a relatively smaller angle than the angle of the angled camming surfaces of the jaw assembly. The offset angled configuration of the locking cam driver and the jaw assembly may facilitate a pulling of the locking cam driver towards the jaw assembly to provide a greater force while closing the jaw assembly, and to prevent the locking cam driver from disengaging from the jaw assembly during actuation thereof. The offset angled configuration may reduce surface-to-surface friction between the angled camming surfaces of the locking cam driver and the angled camming surfaces of the jaw assembly.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Embodiments of surgical clip appliers in accordance with the present disclosure will now be described in detail with reference to the drawing figures wherein like reference numerals identify similar or identical structural elements. As shown in the drawings and described throughout the following description, as is traditional when referring to relative positioning on a surgical instrument, the term “proximal” refers to the end of the apparatus which is closer to the user and the term “distal” refers to the end of the apparatus which is further away from the user. There is disclosed a novel endoscopic surgical clip applier including a drive assembly having, amongst other things, a locking cam driver that is configured to approximate jaw members of a jaw assembly into a substantially closed position. The locking cam driver includes angled camming surfaces that cam along corresponding substantially complementary angled camming surfaces of the jaw assembly. The angled camming surfaces of both the locking cam driver and the jaw assembly are configured to slidingly engage, while locking within each other, in a camming manner. It should be noted that, while the presently disclosed locking cam driver is shown and described with in an endoscopic surgical clip applier, the disclosed locking cam driver and its features may be applicable to any surgical clip applier or any other surgical instrument having a compressible jaw assembly. Referring now to FIG. 1, a surgical clip applying instrument or surgical clip applier 10 is shown including a handle assembly 12 and an endoscopic portion 14. Endoscopic portion 14 includes an elongated tubular member 15 that extends distally from handle assembly 12. Handle assembly 12 includes a stationary handle 16 and a pivoting or movable handle 18. Manipulation of handle 18 relative to handle 16 actuates a jaw assembly 20, which is operably coupled to a distal end 15a of elongated tubular member 15 or endoscopic portion 14. More specifically, jaw assembly 20 is actuated by a plurality of components of a drive assembly, which will be discussed in more detail below. Handle assembly 12 may be made from any suitable thermoplastic material, and elongated member 15 may be made from any suitable biocompatible material, for example, but not limited to stainless steel, titanium or any suitable plastic material. In embodiments, a rotating knob 19 is rotatably mounted on a distal end 12a of handle assembly 12. Rotating knob 19 is operably coupled to elongated tubular member 15 of endoscopic portion 14 to provide remote rotation (e.g., 360° of rotation) of elongated tubular member 15 and jaw assembly 20 along a longitudinal center axis “Z-Z” defined by elongated tubular member 15. Clip applier 10 is configured to retain one or more surgical clips “C” for application to a desired tissue or vessel “V,” as shown in FIG. 13. Clip applier 10 has an elongated clip channel member (not shown) that is disposed within elongated tubular member 15 for retaining a number of surgical clips “C.” As shown in FIG. 2, clip applier 10 includes a nose 66 to direct the clips “C” traversing through the clip channel member (not shown) into channels 28a and 28b of jaw members 26a and 26b of jaw assembly 20. Jaw assembly 20 and its components will be discussed in greater detail below. Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 4, the present surgical clip applier 10 includes various components, which will be briefly discussed, in order to actuate jaw assembly 20 to form a closed clip “C” (FIG. 13) therebetween. A detailed discussion of the structure, operation, and method of assembly of various components surgical clip applier 10 is disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,271 to Whitfield et al., entitled “Apparatus For Applying Surgical Clips” and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0085015 to Whitfield et al., entitled “Endoscopic Surgical Clip Applier,” the entire contents of each of which is incorporated herein by reference. In embodiments, clip applier 10 may include a wedging mechanism (not shown) to perform a wedging function that is provided to maintain jaw assembly 20 in a spaced apart condition for loading clip “C” within jaw assembly 20. Once jaw assembly 20 is loaded with clip “C,” the wedging mechanism is retracted out of jaw assembly 20 to allow approximation of jaw members 20a and 20b by various components of a drive assembly. In embodiments, clip applier 10 may also include a feeding mechanism (not shown) for feeding a single clip “C” into jaw assembly 20, at a distal portion 15a of elongated tubular member 15, during a single firing stroke of clip applier 10. Referring still to FIGS. 3 and 4, the drive assembly of surgical clip applier 10 includes an actuation mechanism 60 that operates to pass through the elongated tubular member 15 to thereby actuate a locking cam driver 50 to close jaw assembly 20 and fully form clip “C”. More specifically, actuation mechanism 60 is translated in a longitudinally distal and proximal direction through the elongated tubular member 15. A distal portion of actuation mechanism 60 includes a drive assembly having locking cam driver 50 and a slider joint 62 that both extend from the distal end of actuation mechanism 60 to selectively engage camming surfaces 40a and 40b provided on jaw assembly 20, which thereby approximate or close jaw members 26a and 26b around a preloaded surgical clip “C.” Actuation mechanism 60 may be operably coupled to locking cam driver 50 via slider joint 62. Actuation mechanism 60, slider joint 62, and locking cam driver 50 are all disposed within elongated tube 15. As will be discussed in greater detail below, actuation of locking cam driver 50 closes the jaw assembly 20 to compress or form a clip “C” that is held therebetween. With reference to FIGS. 5 and 6, jaw assembly 20 and its components will now be discussed in detail. As discussed above, jaw assembly 20 is positioned on distal end 15a of tubular member 15, and includes juxtaposed jaw members 26a and 26b. Both jaw members 26a and 26b are simultaneously movable between a spaced configuration, in which jaw members 26a and 26b are separated at least a sufficient distance defined by a space 24, to receive a surgical clip “C” therebetween, and an approximated, substantially closed configuration, in which jaw members 26a and 26b are in relatively close relation to one another to form a surgical clip “C” around a vessel “V,” as shown in FIG. 13, that has been positioned within surgical clip “C.” Each jaw member 26a and 26b has an elongated channel 28a and 28b, respectively, for receipt of a single surgical clip “C” therein. Surgical clip “C” may be applied or placed in elongated channels 28a and 28b by a loading structure of clip applier 10 to apply surgical clip “C” in, for example, a body cavity. Jaw assembly 20 may be made from a suitable biocompatible material, for example, but not limited to stainless steel, titanium or a suitable alloy. Jaw assembly 20 further includes elongated flexible legs 22a and 22b connected at distal base portion 22c. Flexible legs 22a and 22b are resilient to permit relative approximation and spacing of juxtaposed jaw members 26a and 26b. As discussed above, elongated channels 28a and 28b are provided on or in the juxtaposed inner surfaces of jaw members 26a and 26b for reception of a surgical clip “C.” In an embodiment, jaw assembly 20 may further include locking legs 30a and 30b connected at proximal base portion 34, each having a radially outwardly extending tab 34a and 34b, respectively, formed thereon. Tabs 34a and 34b are configured to engage corresponding holes 36 defined on elongated tube 15 (FIG. 1) to secure jaw assembly 20 to elongated tube 15. It is contemplated that jaw assembly 20 may be secured to elongated 15 in any manner known by one having skill in the art. As depicted in FIG. 5, each of jaw members 26a and 26b includes raised elements 38a and 38b, respectively, formed on a bottom surface thereof. In order to provide increased closing force, camming surfaces 40a and 40b are disposed on an outer surface of each of raised elements 38a and 38b, respectively, to facilitate closure of jaw members 26a and 26b of jaw assembly 20. Camming surfaces 40a and 40b each define an angle “β” relative to a horizontal axis “X-X” defined by jaw members 26a and 26b (FIG. 11) to correspond with substantially complementary angled camming surfaces of locking cam driver 50, which will be described in greater detail below. Turning now to FIGS. 7 and 8, locking cam driver 50 has a hemispherical configuration that includes a flat, top surface 56 that engages (or is adjacent) jaw assembly 20 and a curved portion (e.g., semi-circular) 58 (FIG. 9) that engages (or is adjacent) an inner portion of elongated tubular member 15. At a proximal portion, locking cam driver 50 includes a T-shaped recess 59 that is configured to receive a distal T-shaped end 64 of slider joint 62. It should be noted that other types of connecting configurations may be utilized to connect locking cam driver 50 to slider joint 62. For example, locking cam driver 50 may be connected to slider joint 62 by crimping, welding, bolting, and adhering. At a distal portion, locking cam driver 50 includes a bifurcated configuration having a pair of spaced apart angled camming surfaces 52a and 52b that surround and define a U-shaped space 54 that is dimensioned and configured to receive corresponding substantially complementary angled camming surfaces 40a and 40b of jaw assembly 20. More particularly, distal movement of locking cam driver 50 moves camming surfaces 52a and 52b thereof with respect to and against camming surfaces 40a and 40b of raised elements 38a and 38b to thereby move jaw members 26a and 26b from the un-approximated, open position into the approximated, substantially closed position. When jaw members 26a and 26b are moved to the approximated, substantially closed position, a clip “C” is formed when positioned within elongated channels 28a and 28b of jaw assembly 20, as shown in FIG. 13. Referring now to FIGS. 9-12, during use, handle 18 of handle assembly 12 (FIG. 1) is actuated toward handle 16, to a closed position. During actuation of handle 18, the driving assembly of clip applier 10 moves actuation mechanism 60, slider joint 62, and locking cam driver 50 in a distal direction, as depicted by directional arrow “A” of FIG. 9. As discussed above, during distal movement of locking cam driver 50 relative to jaw assembly 20, camming surfaces 52a and 52b of locking cam driver 50 engage camming surfaces 40a and 40b of jaw members 26a and 26b. In this manner, jaw members 26a and 26b are gradually brought into approximation with distal movement of locking cam driver 50. More particularly, since raised elements 38a and 38b are wider at the distal portion than at the proximal portion, progressive distal movement of U-shaped locking cam driver 50 cams jaw members 26a and 26b towards an approximated, closed position, as depicted by direction arrows “B” of FIG. 9. The proximity of locking cam driver 50 and raised elements 38a and 38b to the distal portion of jaw members 26a and 26b enables sufficient force to be exerted on jaw members 26a and 26b to deform clip “C” and compress blood vessels or other body tissue surrounded thereby. Turning now specifically to FIGS. 10-12, and initially to FIG. 10, camming surfaces 52a and 52b of locking cam driver 50 are configured to define predetermined acute angles “α” relative to a horizontal plane defined by axes “X-X” and “Z-Z.” Camming surfaces 52a and 52b form predetermined acute angles “α” oriented towards space 54 (e.g., towards a center of locking cam driver 50) to provide a capturing configuration. As shown in FIG. 11, calming surfaces 40a and 40b of raised elements 38a and 38b of jaw members 26a and 26b are configured to define predetermined acute angles “β” relative to a horizontal plane defined by axes “X-X” and “Z-Z.” In an opposite manner, with comparison to camming surfaces 52a and 52b of locking cam driver 50, camming surfaces 40a and 40b of raised elements 38a and 38b form predetermined acute angles “β” oriented towards an outer edge of jaw assembly 20 (e.g., away from the center of jaw assembly 20). In accordance with the present disclosure, the plane defined by axes “X-X” and “Z-Z” may also be represented by the plane defined by flexible legs 22a and 22b of jaw assembly 20 and/or by top surface 56 of locking cam driver 50. During actuation of locking cam driver 50 along the jaw assembly 20, as depicted in FIG. 12, the angled camming surfaces 52a and 52b of locking cam driver 50 engage and lock with corresponding angled camming surfaces 40a and 40b to prevent locking cam driver 50 from disengaging from jaw assembly 20. By providing angled camming surfaces 52a and 52b of locking cam driver 50 and angled camming surfaces 40a and 40b of jaw assembly 20, locking cam driver 50 and jaw assembly 20 interlock with each other so that during actuation, locking cam driver 50 is drawn towards jaw assembly 20 to provide more closure force. The angled configuration also maintains jaw members 26a and 26b in alignment with each other (e.g., along the “X-X” axis), which prevents clips “C” from twisting during formation. In embodiments, predetermined angles “α” of camming surfaces 52a and 52b of locking cam driver 50 and predetermined angles “β” of camming surfaces 40a and 40b of jaw assembly 20 may have different degree values to provide an offset angled configuration. More particularly, predetermined angles “α” may be a relatively smaller angle (e.g., 30 degrees) than predetermined angles “β” (e.g., 45 degrees). The offset angled configuration facilitates pulling of the locking cam driver 50 towards jaw assembly 20 to provide a greater force while closing jaw assembly 20 and to prevent locking cam driver 50 from disengaging from jaw assembly 20 during actuation. The offset angled configuration also reduces surface-to-surface friction between camming surfaces 40a and 40b and camming surfaces 52a and 52b, respectively, since the planes of each corresponding camming surfaces are offset because of the difference in the degree values for angles “α” and “β.” During a manufacturing process, the angled camming surfaces 40a and 40b of respective jaw members 26a and 26b can be machined in a one-step process. More particularly, an angled cutter head may be used to cut the angled camming surface 40a and 40b along the side of raised elements 38a and 38b, respectively. It should be understood that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present disclosure. Various alternatives and modifications can be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the disclosure. Accordingly, the present disclosure is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variances.
