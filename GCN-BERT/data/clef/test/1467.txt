Preparation: To a 500 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with condenser and argon inlet were added aluminum chloride (6.30 g, 47.25 mmol), carbon disulfide (35 mL), and chloroacetyl chloride (1.83 g, 16.20 mmol) under ice-bath. The mixture was stirred for 15 mins. The mixture was added 3,4-dihydrocoumarin (2.00 g, 13.50 mmol) in portions over 5 mins. The reaction was stirred for 10 minutes prior to reflux for 2.5 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled and the solvent was decanted off. Then ice and cold water (50 mL) was slowly added while stirred thoroughly. The tan precipitate was collected by filtration and washing thoroughly with water. The crude precipitate was suspended and sonicated in diethyl ether (10 mL) and the resulted fine solid was again collected by filtration and dried under vacuum to give 6-(2-chloroacetyl)chroman-2-one (1.60 g, 53%) as a beige solid.
