HIP JOINT DEVICE, SYSTEM AND METHOD FIELD OF INVENTION [0001] The present invention relates generally to a medical device for implantation in a human patient. BACKGROUND [0002] Hip joint Osteoarthritis is a syndrome in which low-grade inflammation results in pain in the hip joints, caused by abnormal wearing of the Cartilage that acts as a cushion inside if the hip joint. This abnormal wearing of the cartilage also results in a decrease of the joints lubricating fluid called Synovial fluid. Hip joint Osteoarthritis is estimated to affect 80% of all people over 65 years of age, in more or less serious forms. [0003] Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field. [0004] The present treatment of hip osteoarthritis comprises NSAID drugs, local injections of Hyaluronic acid or Glucocorticoid to help lubricating the hip joint, and replacing parts of the hip joint with a prosthesis through hip joint surgery. [0005] The replacing of parts of the hip joint is one of the most common surgeries to date performed at hundreds of thousands of patients in the world every year. The most common method comprises placing a metal prosthesis in Femur and a plastic bowl in Acetabulum. This operation is done through a lateral incision in the hip and upper thigh and through, Fascia Lata and the lateral muscles of the thigh. To get access to the joint, the supporting hip joint capsule attached to Femur and Ilium needs to be penetrated, making it difficult to get a fully functional joint after the surgery. Femur is then cut at the neck with a bone saw and the prosthesis is placed in femur either with bone cement or without. Acetabulum is slightly enlarged using an Acetabular reamer, and the plastic bowl is positioned using screws or bone cement. [0006] The surgery typically requires one week of hospitalization due to the increased risk of infection. The recovery process is on average about 6 weeks, but even after this period the patient should not perform any physical activates that places large strain on the joint. [0007] The correct placement of the prosthesis or prosthetic parts is an important part of the operation since it affects the hip joint’s ability to heal correctly, and also affects the function of the hip joint after the hip joint replacement surgery. Due to limited reach and visibility inside the hip joint, the placing of the prosthesis is a difficult and time consuming step of the operation with numerous possibilities for errors. [0008] It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.

response. Biocompatible materials are sometimes also referred to as biomaterials. Analogous is biocompatible metals a biocompatible metal with low immune response such as titanium or tantalum. The biocompatible metal could also be a biocompatible alloy comprising at least one biocompatible metal. [0151 ] A metal alloy is to be understood as a mixture of two or more elements in solid solution in which the major component is a metal. A steel alloy is hence an alloy wherein one of the components is steel which in turn is an alloy of iron and carbon. A titanium alloy is hence an alloy wherein one of the components is titanium. [0152] Elasticity is to be understood as a materials ability to deform in an elastic way. [0153] Carrying surface and weight carrying surface is to be understood as a surface adapted to carry weight inside of the hip joint. [0154] Form fitting is to be understood as an element having a part or section which is adapted to enable a mechanical connection of said element to at least one other element using said part or section. Form fitted structure is a structure of an element which enables form fitting. [0155] Functional hip movements are to be understood as movements of the hip that at least partly correspond to the natural movements of the hip. On some occasions the natural movements of the hip joint might be somewhat limited or altered after hip joint surgery, which makes the functional hip movements of a hip joint with artificial surfaces somewhat different than the functional hip movements of a natural hip joint. [0156] The functional position of an implantable medical device or prosthesis is the position in which the hip joint can perform functional hip movements. [0157] Functional hip joint is a hip joint that can perform functional hip movements either with or without an implanted medical device or prosthesis. [0158] Connection line is to be understood as a line of the connecting surface of at least two medical device parts connecting to each other. [0159] In the following a detailed description of preferred embodiments of the present invention will be given. In the drawing figures, like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding elements throughout the several figures. It will be appreciated that these figures are for illustration only and are not in any way restricting the scope of the invention. Thus, any references to direction, such as “up” or “down”, are only referring to the directions shown in the figures. Also, any dimensions etc. shown in the figures are for illustration purposes. [0160] The medical device according to any of the embodiments could comprise at least one material selected from a group consisting of: polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) and fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). It is furthermore conceivable that the material comprises a metal alloy, such as cobalt-chromium-molybdenum or titanium or stainless steel, or polyethylene, such as cross-linked polyethylene or gas sterilized polyethylene. The use of ceramic material is also conceivable, in the contacting surfaces or the entire medical device such as zirconium or zirconium dioxide ceramics or alumina ceramics. The part of the medical device in contact with human bone for fixation of the medical device to human bone could comprise a poorhouse structure which could be a porous micro or nanostructure adapted to promote the growth-in of human bone in the medical device for fixating the medical device. The porous structure could be achieved by applying a hydroxy-apatite (HA) coating, or a rough open-pored titanium coating, which could be produced by air plasma spraying, a combination comprising a rough open-pored titanium coating and a HA top layer is also conceivable. The contacting parts could be made of a self lubricated material such as a waxy polymer, such as PTFE, PFA, FEP, PE and UHMWPE, or a powder metallurgy material which could be infused with a lubricant, which preferably is a biocompatible lubricant such as a Hyaluronic acid derivate. It is also conceivable that the material of contacting parts or surfaces of the medical device herein is adapted to be constantly or intermittently lubricated. According to some embodiments the parts or portions of the medical device could comprise a combination of metal materials and/or carbon fibers and/or boron, a combination of metal and plastic materials, a combination of metal and carbon based material, a combination of carbon and plastic based material, a combination of flexible and stiff materials, a combination of elastic and less elastic materials, Corian or acrylic polymers. [0161 ] Fig. 1 a shows the hip joint of a human patient in section. The hip joint comprises a caput femur 5 placed at the very top of collum femur 6 which is the top part of the femur bone 7. The caput femur 5 is in connection with the acetabulum 8 which is a bowl shaped part of the pelvic bone 9. Both the caput femur surface 10 and the acetabulum surface 11 is covered with articular cartilage 13 which acts as a cushion in the hip joint. In patients with hip joint osteoarthritis, this articular cartilage 13 is abnormally worn down due to a low grade inflammation. The hip joint is surrounded by the hip joint capsule 12 which provides support for the joint and hinders luxation. After conventional hip joint surgery, penetrating the hip joint capsule 12, the capsule 12 is dramatically weakened due to the limited healing possibilities of its ligament tissue. By performing hip joint surgery without damaging the hip joint capsule 12, the patient can fully recover and place equal amount of strain on an artificial joint as is possible on a natural one. [0162] Fig. 1 b shows the collum femur 6 in section. Both caput femur 5 and collum femur 6 further comprises cortical bone 601, the outer more sclerotic bone, and cancellous bone 602, placed in the bone marrow 603. The cortical bone is much more dense and beneficial to anchor a prosthesis two, or to place a positioning shaft in, whereas the cancellous bone 602 provides stability in the bone due to its sandwich construction, but is easy to remove to make room for a fixation member of a prosthesis. [0163] Fig. 2 shows a frontal view of the body of a human patient. A surgical method of operating the hip joint from the opposite side from acetabulum, is according to a first embodiment performed starting with an incision 1 in the abdominal wall of the human patient. The incision 1 passes through the abdominal muscles in to the abdomen of the human patent. In a second embodiment the incision 2 is conducted through the abdominal muscles and in to the pelvic area, below peritoneum. According to a third embodiment the incision 3 is performed just between lllium and the surrounding tissue, an incision 3 which could enable the pelvic bone to be dissected with very little penetration of fascia and muscular tissue. According to a fourth embodiment the incision 4 is made in the inguinal channel. In all of the four embodiments the tissue surrounding the pelvic bone 9 in the area opposite to acetabulum is removed or penetrated which enables the surgeon to reach the pelvic bone 9. [0164] Fig. 3 shows a frontal view of the body of a human patient. A laparoscopic/arthroscopic method of operating the hip joint, from the opposite side from acetabulum, is according to a first embodiment performed starting with making small incisions 14 in the abdominal wall of the human patient. The small incisions enable the surgeon to insert laparoscopic trocars into the abdomen of the human patient. According to the first embodiment the incisions 14 passes through the abdominal wall, in to the abdomen of the human patent. According to a second embodiment the small incisions 15 is conducted through the abdominal wall, in to the pelvic area, below peritoneum. According to a third embodiment the small incisions 16 is performed just between lllium and the surrounding tissue, an incision 16 which could enable the pelvic bone to be dissected with very little penetration of fascia and muscular tissue. According to a fourth embodiment the incision 17 is made in the inguinal channel. In all of the four embodiments the tissue surrounding the pelvic bone 9 in the area opposite to acetabulum 8 is removed or penetrated which enables the surgeon to reach the pelvic bone 9. [0165] Fig. 4 shows a lateral view of a conventional hip joint surgery where an incision 112 is made in the thigh 113 enabling the surgeon to reach the femur bone 7 on which the caput femur 5 is located. In a conventional hip joint surgery the hip joint is accessed through the hip joint capsule, which forces the surgeon to, at least partly, savage the structure of the capsule. [0166] Fig. 5 to enable the surgeon to reach the caput femur 5 the femoral bone 7 comprising the caput femur 5 is placed outside of the hip joint capsule 12. The surgeon can thereby perform surgical modifications on the caput femur including fixating holding members or prosthetic parts to the surface or the bone structure of any part of the femoral bone 7. [0167] Fig. 6 shows the placing of a positioning shaft 900 in the caput femur 5 and collum femur 6, penetrating the surface and the cortical bone of the caput femur 5. For example the positioning shaft can be fixated to the bone structure of the femoral bone 7 the collum femur 6 or the caput femur 5 using mechanical fixating members, adhesive, a threaded section of the positioning shaft 900 or using an expanding part or section of the positioning shaft 900. [0168] Fig. 7 shows the femoral bone 7, comprising the collum femur 6 and the caput femur 5, when a hole 902 going through the surface and the cortical bone of the caput femur 5 and in to the cancellous bone of the caput femur 5 and collum femur 6. The hole 902 is created using a drill 901, which could be powered using an operation device or through manual force. [0169] Fig. 8a shows the placing of a positioning shaft 900 in the hole 902 in the surface of the caput femur 5 the cortical bone of the caput femur 5 and the cancellous bone of the collum femur 6. For example the positioning shaft 900 can be fixated to the bone structure of the femoral bone 7 the collum femur 6 or the caput femur 5 using mechanical fixating members, adhesive, a threaded section of the positioning shaft 900 or using an expanding part or section of the positioning shaft 900. [0170] Fig. 8b shows the step of placing an artificial caput femur surface 45 on the caput femur 5 using the positioning shaft 900. The artificial caput femur surface 45 comprises a hole adapted to encircle the positioning shaft 900 such that the positioning shaft 900 positions and centers the artificial caput femur surface 45 in a suitable position on the caput femur 5. [0171] Fig. 9 shows the hip joint in section, when an artificial caput femur surface 45 is positioned on the caput femur using a positioning shaft 900 placed in a hole 902 in the caput femur 5 and collum femur 6. The caput femur 5 is according to this embodiment inserted through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 from the opposite side from acetabulum 8, which also is the way the positioning shaft 900 has been inserted in the caput femur 5 and collum femur 6. To enable the artificial caput femur to be inserted through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 having a diameter d1 smaller than the diameter d2 required for the artificial caput femur surface 45 to reach over the caput femur 5. The artificial caput femur surface 45 therefore comprises elastic material which enables the artificial caput femur surface 45 to in a first state have a first diameter d1, for passing through the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9, and in a second state have a second diameter d2 for reaching over the caput femur 5, and in a third state have a third diameter d3 for clasping the caput femur 5, thereby creating a stable position inside the hip joint. The artificial caput femur surface comprises a hole adapted to encircle the positioning shaft 900 for positioning and centering the artificial caput femur surface 45 inside the hip joint. [0172] Fig. 10 shows the step of inserting an artificial acetabulum surface 65 through the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 using a positioning shaft 900 placed in a hole 902 in the caput femur 5 and the collum femur 6. The positioning shaft 900 assists in the positioning and centering of the artificial caput femur surface 45 to the caput femur 5 in the hip joint. To enable the insertion of the artificial caput femur surface 45 through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 the size of the artificial caput femur surface 45 is adapted to be changed. In a first state for inserting the artificial caput femur surface 45 through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 the artificial caput femur surface 45 has a largest diameter d1, smaller than the diameter of the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. [0173] Fig. 11 shows the removal of the positioning shaft 900 from the hole 902 in the caput femur 5, after the placing of the artificial acetabulum surface 65. After the artificial acetabulum surface 65 has passed through the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 the surface is expanded to represent the entire contacting surface of the acetabulum 8, and the largest diameter is now d2 which confines the artificial acetabulum surface inside of the hip joint. The use of the positioning shaft 900 also ensures the correct centering of the caput femur surface 45 in relation to the artificial acetabulum surface 65 inside of the hip joint. [0174] Figs. 12-14 shows the process of placing an artificial caput femur surface 45 on the caput femur 5 in the hip joint through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. The artificial caput femur surface 45 is inserted through the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 in its folded state, as shown in fig. 12, positioned, guided and centered by the positioning shaft 900 fixated to the caput femur 5 and the collum femur 45. After the passing of the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 the artificial caput femur surface 45 is expanded as shown in fig. 13 and eventually clasps the caput femur 5 as shown in fig. 14, whereafter the positioning shaft 900 is removed, as shown in fig. 14. [0175] An alternative embodiment of fixation of a medical device comprising an artificial caput femur will now be described with reference to figs. 15-18. [0176] Fig. 15 shows the hip joint in section in a step in which the caput femur 5 has been removed and a surface of the section 610 in the collum femur 6 is being prepared for the fixation of an artificial caput femur 600. An injecting member 613 applies and adhesive 614 to the surface of the section 610 of the collum femur 6. The injecting member 613 is adapted to be introduced through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 and to apply the adhesive 614 which was contained within the injecting member 613. Furthermore a positioning shaft 900 is placed in the collum femur 6 from the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. The positioning shaft is preferably fixated to the cortical bone of the femoral bone 7 as well as the cancellous bone of the collum femur 6. [0177] Fig. 16 shows the step of introducing and fixating the medical device 600 to the collum femur 6, through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. The stabilizing member 612 is adapted to stabilize the medical device 600 from the outside of the collum femur 6 substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6, and from the acetabulum side, substantially in line with the longitudinal extension of the collum femur 6 through the stabilizing member 612 being placed in contact with the outside of the collum femur 6 and the surface of the section 610 in the collum femur 6. The stabilizing member 612 is fixated to the outside of the collum femur 6 and/or to the surface of the section 610 in the collum femur 6 by means of the adhesive 614. Flowever the adhesive 614 could be replaced or assisted by bone cement or a mechanical fixation element 615. The medical device 600 is positioned, guided and centered a positioning shaft 900 placed in the collum femur 6 from the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. The positioning shaft 900 is preferably fixated to the cortical bone of the femoral bone 7 as well as the cancellous bone of the collum femur 6. [0178] Fig. 17 shows the hip joint in section when the medical device 600 is positioned on the collum femur 6. The stabilizing member 612 is here fixated to the collum femur 6 by means of adhesive 614 and a mechanical fixation element 615, such as a screw or pin. [0179] Fig. 18 shows the hip joint in section when the medical device 600 is positioned on the collum femur 6. The stabilizing member 612 is here fixated to the collum femur by means of adhesive 614. A prosthetic part 98 comprising an artificial acetabulum surface 618 has been positioned in the hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. The artificial acetabulum surface 618 is adapted to be in direct of indirect connection with the artificial caput femur surface 607. In embodiments where the artificial acetabulum surface 618 is adapted to be in indirect connection with the artificial caput femur surface 607 a lubricating fluid or a lubricating material (not shown) can be placed between said artificial acetabulum surface 618 and said artificial caput femur surface 607. The prosthetic part 98 is adapted to carry the load placed on the artificial acetabulum surface 618 from weight of the human patient through the contact with the artificial caput femur surface 607 by means of the supporting members 99. The prosthetic part 98 can further be fixated to the pelvic bone 9 by means of bone cement, adhesive, screws, form fitting, welding, sprints, band or some other mechanical connecting member. According to this embodiment the supporting members 99 are positioned on the acetabulum side of the pelvic bone 9, however it is also conceivable that the supporting members 99 are positioned on the abdominal side of the pelvic bone 9. The supporting means could be constructed in many different ways and this should be seen as examples. [0180] An alternative method of creating a hole in the pelvic bone, preparing the surfaces of the caput femur and the acetabulum, inserting the positioning shaft and inserting and fixating artificial hip joint surface parts will now be described with reference to figs. 19-23. [0181] Fig. 19 shows a human patient in section when an incision 1 is made in the abdominal wall of the human patient, and a second incision 200 in made in the lateral part of the left thigh. A drilling member 201 has been introduced through the incision 200 in the thigh, penetrating the fascia lata, and reaching the femoral bone 7. After the drilling member 201 has made contact with the femoral bone 7, a drilling process is started which creates a hole 205 in the cortical bone of the femoral bone 7 and into the cancellous bone of the femoral bone 7, the hole 205 then propagates along a length axis of the collum femur 6 and eventually reaches the caput femur 5, from the inside thereof. The caput femur 5 is penetrated from the inside and the drilling member 201 continues to the acetabulum 8 which is a bowled shaped part of the pelvic bone 9. The drilling member 201 penetrates the pelvic bone 9 and continues into the abdominal area of the human patient. The drilling member 201 is then retracted from the hole 205 which leaves a hole 201 reaching from the lateral side of the thigh, to the area of the hip joint. The drilling member 201 is powered by an operating device 202 which could be an electrically, hydraulically or pneumatically powered operating device 202. [0182] After the hole 205 has been created along a length axis of the collum femur 6, a force transferring member 206 is inserted through the hole 205. The force transferring member could be a tubular or solid shaft, or a flexible member such as a wire. [0183] Fig. 20 shows the hip joint in section when a force transferring member 206 has been inserted through the hole 205. The force transferring member 206 comprises a tool fixating member 218 positioned on the end of the force transferring member 206. The tool fixating member 218 could comprise a screw-thread or a bayonet joint which could be activated to fixate a tool 224,225,226 to the force transferring member 206, by the turning of said force transferring member by means of manual manipulation or an operating device 207. Fig. 5 further shows a tool for creating a hole 224 in the pelvic bone 9, a tool 225 for manipulating an implantable device such as a prosthesis or a prosthetic part, and a tool 226 for reaming the acetabulum 8 and/or the caput femur 5. The tools comprise a fixating member 219 which acts together with the tool fixating member 218 on the force transferring member 206 to fixate the tool 224,225,226 to the force transferring member 206. The tools 224,225,226 is inserted through the incision in the abdominal region, as shown in fig. 4. where a tool 224 for creating a hole in the pelvic bone 9 is inserted through an incision 1 in the abdominal region of the human patient using a tool introducing member 203. The force transferring member 206 according to any of the embodiments could be used as a positioning shaft, for positioning, centering and guiding a tool or a medical device, such as a prosthetic part. [0184] Fig. 21 shows the hip joint in section when a tool 224 for creating a hole 18b in the pelvic bone is fixated to the tool fixating member 219 on the force transferring member 206. When the tool 224 for creating a hole in the pelvic bone 9 is applied to the force transferring member 206, the force transferring member 206 is preferably operated using an operating device 207, which could be an electrical, hydraulic or pneumatic operating device. The tool for creating a hole in the pelvic bone 9 comprises a bone contacting organ 22 which is adapted to create the hole 18b in the pelvic bone 9 through a sawing, drilling or milling process powered by a rotating, vibrating or oscillating movement of the force transferring member 206. [0185] Fig. 22 shows the hip joint in section when the hole 18b in the pelvic bone 9 has been created. According to the embodiment shown the hole 18b is created through the creation of a bone plug 207 which can be adapted to be replaced after the steps of the operation performed through the hole 18b in the pelvic bone 9 has been concluded. [0186] Fig. 23 shows the reaming of the acetabulum 8 and/or the caput femur 5 using a reamer 226 comprising reaming blades 40. The reamer 226 is adapted to be introduced through the pelvic bone 9 through an incision as shown in fig. 2. The reamer 226 is operated through manual manipulation or an operating device 207. [0187] Fig. 24a shows the reamer 226 according to an embodiment where the reamer 226 is adapted to be expandable. The reaming blades 42 are folded, which facilitates the introduction of the reamer 226 through the hole 18b in the pelvic bone 9. [0188] Fig. 24b shows the expandable reamer in its reaming state with the reaming blades 40 unfolded. The reaming blades 40 comprises an abrasive material which removes material, shapes and smoothens the surface of the acetabulum 8 and/or the caput femur 5. 41a denotes the abrasive material on the outside of the reaming blade 40, adapted to ream the acetabulum 8 surface. [0189] Fig. 24c shows the expandable reamer from the inside thereof, with the reaming blades 40 and the abrasive material 41 b adapted to ream the caput femur 5. [0190] After the surfaces of the caput femur 5 and/or the acetabulum 8 has been prepared the step of providing the surfaces with an artificial acetabulum surface 65 and/or an artificial caput femur surface 65 is performed. [0191 ] Fig. 25 shows the step of providing an artificial caput femur surface 45 which is inserted through the incision according to fig. 2 or fig. 3. The artificial caput femur surface 45 is then mounted on to the force transferring member 206 which acts a guide for the surface 45, facilitating the introduction and fixation of said surface 45. Flowever it is furthermore conceivable that the force transferring member 206 is replaced by a positioning shaft according to any of the embodiments described herein, adapted to position, center or guide the artificial caput femur surface 45 on to the caput femur 5. [0192] An alternative way of providing an artificial hip joint surface to a surgically modified caput femur will now be described, with reference to figs. 26 - 34 [0193] Fig. 26 shows a lateral view of a human patient where a surgical instrument 35 adapted to create a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 from the abdominal side of the pelvic bone 9 is inserted through an incision in the abdominal wall. The surgical instrument could comprises a flexible part or section 300, enabling the surgical instrument to be very precisely adjusted to reach the pelvic bone 9 or the hip joint from the abdominal side of the pelvic bone 9. The stiffness of said flexible part or section 300 could range from completely flexible to completely stiff to fit the surroundings of the particular operation. The surgical instrument 35 could be powered through an operating device which in turn could comprise an electrical, hydraulic, mechanical, pneumatic or magnetic engine and it could be adapted to create a rotating, oscillating, vibrating or repetitive movement. [0194] Fig. 27 shows a hip joint in section wherein a surgical instrument 35 adapted to create a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9 is adapted to create a bone plug 31. The bone plug 31 could be adapted to be replaced into said hole 18 after the surgical or laparoscopic steps performed in the hip joint has been concluded. [0195] Fig. 28 shows a hip joint in section wherein a surgical instrument 604 for removing the caput femur 5 is provided through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. The surgical instrument comprises a sawing member 605 adapted to separate the caput femur 5 from the collum femur 6. The surgical instrument is powered through a force transferring member 21 which transfers force from an operation device or manual manipulation. [0196] Fig. 29 shows the hip joint in section when the method of supplying a medical device is conducted according to another embodiment. The proximal part of the caput femur has been removed by the surgical instrument comprising a sawing member 605. A reaming member 40 adapted to create a concave surface 103 in the caput femur 5 is here applied to a force transferring member 206 which is inserted through a hole 205 going from the lateral side of the thigh, penetrating the cortical bone of the femoral bone 7 propagating along a length axis of the collum femur 6 in the cancellous bone and entering the area of the hip joint. The force transferring member 206 is operated using an operating device 207 which could be an electrically powered operating device, a hydraulically powered operating device or a pneumatically powered operating device. The reamer 40 is inserted into the body of the patient through an incision and placed in the hip joint through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9. The reaming in the caput femur and part of the collum femur 6 is mainly performed in the cancellous bone, however that does not exclude the possibility the some of the reaming needs to be performed in the cortical bone of the caput femur 5 or the collum femur 6. [0197] Fig. 30 shows the step of applying an adhesive 106 to the concave surface created by the reamer 40. The adhesive 106 is applied by an injecting member 104 comprising an injecting nozzle 105. The adhesive 106 is preferably a biocompatible adhesive such as bone cement. The injecting member 104 is in this embodiment adapted for introduction through a hole 18 in the pelvic bone 9, through the injecting member 104 being bent. [0198] Fig. 16 shows the step of providing a medical device 109 comprising an artificial concave hip joint surface 110. The medical device is according to this embodiment provided with a hole 905 positioned along the length axis of the collum femur 6.
