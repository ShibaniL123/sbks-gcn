FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to environmental protection, particularly to a modified activated sludge-based two-compartment treatment method for processing nitrate-contaminated drinking water and the device thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Nitrate contamination of drinking water is increasingly common in many countries. Intake of itrate induces the formation of nitrite in human body, which has harmful effects on human health. Therefore, reliable and efficient removal of nitrate in drinking water receives more and more attention. Nitrate in drinking water may be removed by physical, chemical and biochemical methods. According to the types of electron donor, biochemical denitrification may be divided into two categories: autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrification. Common electron donors for autotrophic denitrification are elemental sulfur and hydrogen gas, Bacterial yield of autotrophic denitrification is low, so is its processing efficiency. Acidity and sulfate produced in sulfur-supported autotrophic denitrification may reduce the pH and the quality of the processed water. The use of calcium carbonate for adjusting the pH of such treated water will subsequently increase the water hardness. Secondary contamination derived from hydrogenotrophic denitrification is also relatively small, but the low solubility of hydrogen gas causes operational difficulties in transport/utilization of hydrogen gas and control of pH during hydrogenotrophic denitrification. So, it is not easy to operate hydrogenotrophic denitrification on large scale. Compared to autotrophic denitrification, heterotrophic denitrification has a higher processing capability per unit volume. Fixed bed and fluidized bed bioreactors are commonly used for heterotrophic denitrification treatment of nitrate-contaminated drinking water. A fixed-bed bioreactor needs to overcome the problem of clogging in the long run. For a fluidized bed bioreactor, the operational cost is high to maintain a high processing ability. A conventional activated sludge-based approach, widely used for nitrate removal in wastewater treatment, is not readily suitable for nitrate removal from drinking water, mainly because it is poor at precise control of the addition of organic carbon source during denitrification and the formation of water soluble organic matter, suspended solids and residual nitrite in the produced water, and hard to meet the high requirements of drinking water. Among various activated sludge-based approaches, operation of activated sludge in sequencing batch mode under automatic control is competitive in terms of controlling the quality of produced water and flexibility in operational scale. Activated sludge treatment of nitrate contaminated drinking water on large scale is possible, if taking proper measures to improve the settling property of conventional activated sludge, adopting an organic carbon-dominated and hydrogen gas-supplemented electron donor supply strategy, and operating in sequencing batch mode, in order to avoid excessive addition of organic carbon source and to reliably control the formation of water soluble organics, suspended solids and nitrite in the produced water. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a modified activated sludge-based two-compartment treatment method and a device for processing nitrate-contaminated drinking water. In this method, a first TiO2-modified denitrifying activated sludge bioreactor is fed with nitrate-containing raw water and operates in sequencing batch mode under organic carbon source limited condition to partly reduce nitrate and accumulate nitrite; a second TiO2-modified denitrifying activated sludge bioreactor is fed with the effluent from the first bioreactor, added with mixed organic carbon sources and hydrogen gas to support the cooperation of heterotrophic and hydrogenotrophic denitrification in order to completely reduce the remaining nitrate and the accumulated nitrite to nitrogen gas; the denitrified effluent from the second bioreactor is settled in a settling tank, disinfected with ozone, filtered with activated carbon, and finally becomes nitrate-removed drinkable water. The denitrified effluent from the second bioreactor enters the settling tank, and TiO2 containing precipitates collected from the settling tank are subject to sequential base and acid treatment before being transferred into the first bioreactor for TiO2 recycling. After 5-20 cycles of accumulation, the TiO2-containing precipitates collected from the settling tank are sequentially treated with 10-50 mM NaOH and 10-50 mM HCl, and washed before being injected into the first bioreactor for TiO2 recycling. The TiO2-modified denitrifying activated sludge used in the two bioreactors is prepared by gradually adding TiO2 to conventional denitrifying activated sludge and culturing the sludge in sequencing batch mode until the sludge volume index (SVI) is 80 mL/g or less, the mass fraction of TiO2 to total sludge is 20%-60%, and the sludge concentration is 3-6 g/L. The first bioreactor is dosed with mixed organic carbon sources capable of removing 60%-85% of nitrate from the raw water through heterotrophic denitrification. The second bioreactor is dosed with mixed organic carbon sources in a controlled amount capable of removing 0-30% nitrate from the raw water through heterotrophic denitrification, and the remaining need of electron donor is provided with hydrogen gas, to support the cooperation of heterotrophic and hydrogenotrophic denitrification. The mixed organic carbon sources are composed of acetic acid and ethanol at a molar ratio of 4-2:1. The hydrogen gas supplied during the cooperation of heterotrophic and hydrogenotrophic denitrification is intermittently provided by an electrolytic hydrogen production device, and intermittently pumped from the headspace of the bioreactor to its bottom to conduct intermittent anaerobic aeration. A TiO2-modified activated two-compartment treatment device for processing nitrate-contaminated drinking water comprises a raw water tank 1, a first TiO2-modified heterotrophic denitrifying activated sludge bioreactor 2, a second TiO2-modified heterotrophic and hydrogenotrophic denitrifying activated sludge bioreactor 3, a settling tank 4, an ozone disinfection and activated carbon filtration tank 5, a storage tank 6, a precipitates treatment tank 7, a concentrated organic carbon source tank 8, an electrolytic hydrogen production device 9, and a pressure regulating bag 10. The raw water tank 1, the first bioreactor 2, the second bioreactor 3, the settling tank 4, the filtration tank 5, and the storage tank 6 are sequentially connected through pipes. The concentrated organic carbon source tank 8 and the pressure regulating bag 10 are placed between the first bioreactor 2 and the second bioreactor 3. The outlet of the electrolytic hydrogen production device 9 is connected to the headspace of the second bioreactor 3; one of the two outlets of the precipitates treatment tank 7 is connected to the settling tank 4, and the other outlet is connected to the first bioreactor 2; the concentrated organic carbon source tank 8 is connected to the first bioreactor 2 and the second bioreactor 3 by a peristaltic pump; the pressure regulating bag 10 is connected to the headspace of the first bioreactor 2 and the second bioreactor 3. The whole system automatically operates in sequencing batch mode with drainage in a reverse order as follows: from the filtration tank 5 into the storage tank 6, from the settling tank 4 into the filtration tank 5, from the second bioreactor 3 into the settling tank 4, from the first bioreactor 2 into the second bioreactor 3, and from the raw water tank 1 into the first bioreactor 2. The TiO2-containing precipitates collected from the settling tank 4 are transferred into the precipitates treatment tank 7, sequentially treated with base and acid, and transferred into the first bioreactor 2. The invention divides the operation of denitrification into two compartments. Nitrate-contaminated raw water first enters the first bioreactor; and the nitrate is partially reduced and nitrite is accumulated through limiting the addition of organic carbon source. The effluent from the first bioreactor enters the second bioreactor, with the remaining nitrate and the accumulated nitrite being completely denitrified into nitrogen gas under sufficient supply of organic carbon source and hydrogen gas. The effluent from the second bioreactor enters the settling tank, and TiO2-containing precipitates are collected from the settling tank, sequentially treated with base and acid and transferred into the first bioreactor for TiO2 recycling. The effluent from the settling tank is disinfected with ozone and filtered with activated carbon, and finally has suitable levels of pH and carbonate alkalinity and acceptable levels of nitrate, nitrite and water soluble organics to meet the safety standard for drinking water. It is very suitable to use the TiO2-modified activated sludge-based two-compartment denitrification method for processing nitrate contaminated drinking water on large scale. The invention has the following advantages: i) TiO2-modified activated sludge-based two-compartment denitrification can avoid organic carbon source excess during denitrification and effectively control the levels of residual nitrite, dissolved organic matter and suspended solids in the treated water; ii) TiO2-modified activated sludge-based two-compartment denitrification suits large-scale processing of nitrate-contaminated drinking water. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a modified activated sludge-based two-compartment treatment device used in examples for processing nitrate-contaminated drinking water. EMBODIMENTS Example 1 The device comprises a raw water tank 1, a first TiO2-modified heterotrophic denitrifying activated sludge bioreactor 2, a second TiO2-modified heterotrophic and hydrogenotrophic denitrifying activated sludge bioreactor 3, a settling tank 4, an ozone disinfection and activated carbon filtration tank 5, a storage tank 6, a precipitates treatment tank 7, a concentrated carbon source tank 8, an electrolytic hydrogen production device 9, and a pressure regulating bag 10. The concentrated carbon source tank 8 is connected to the first bioreactor 2 and second bioreactor 3 by a peristaltic pump. The pressure regulating bag 10 is connected to the headspace of the first bioreactor 2 and the second bioreactor 3 to regulate their headspace pressures during water filling and drawing operation (The solenoid valve of the pressure regulating bag is open when the bag pressure is above 0.110 MPa and is closed when the bag pressure is below 0.105 MPa). The raw water tank 1, the first bioreactor 2, the second bioreactor 3, the settling tank 4, the filtration tank 5 and the storage tank 6 are sequentially connected through pipes. Water inflow and outflow of each component are controlled by solenoid valves. The first bioreactor 2 and the second bioreactor 3 are sequencing batch reactors. The filtration tank 5 has the functions of ozone disinfection and activated carbon filtration. The outlet of the electrolytic hydrogen production device 9 is connected to the headspace of the second bioreactor 3. One of the two outlets of the precipitates treatment tank 7 is connected to the settling tank 4, and the other outlet is connected to the first bioreactor 2. The whole system automatically operates in sequencing batch mode with drainage in a reverse order as follows: from the filtration tank 5 into the storage tank 6, from the settling tank 4 into the filtration tank 5, from the second bioreactor 3 into the settling tank 4, from the first bioreactor 2 into the second bioreactor 3, and from the raw water tank 1 into the first bioreactor 2. TiO2-containing precipitates collected from the settling tank 4 are transferred into the precipitated treatment tank 7, sequentially treated with base and acid and transferred into the first bioreactor 2. Setup of the Device Each of the two bioreactors is cylinder-shape, with diameter 9 cm, height 100 cm, volume 6.4 L, and effective volume 5.7 L. The first bioreactor 2 is sealed and intermittently aerated with gas produced from denitrification and the second bioreactor 3 is sealed, and intermittently aerated with hydrogen gas provided by the electrolytic hydrogen production device 9. The settling tank 4 and the filtration tank 5 have the same size and shape as the two bioreactors. Water in the settling tank 4 was settled over 60 min (TiO2-containing precipitates transferred into the precipitates treatment tank 7) and then drained into the filtration tank 5, in which, ozone disinfection was intermittently conducted (30 s disinfection, 2 min idling), altogether lasting 13 min. Afterwards, the water in the filtration tank 5 was slowly filtered through activated carbon into the storage tank 6. TiO2-modified denitrifying activated sludge was prepared by gradually adding TiO2 into conventional denitrifying activated sludge, and culturing the sludge under sequencing batch mode as follows: the bioreactor had an effective volume of 20 L; the initial activated sludge concentration was about 2.5 g/L; culture temperature was 20-26° C.; nitrate concentration was 5 mM, acetic acid concentration was 2.5 mM, ethanol concentration was 1.0 mM. In each cycle of the operation (4-24 h duration), the bioreactor was intermittently mixed (0.5 min stirring, 4.5 min idling), settled for 1 h before sequential draining and filling of 10 L water. TiO2-modified denitrifying activated sludge was obtained after weekly addition of TiO2 at a rate of about 10% of active sludge for 6 weeks, with the sludge volume index (SVI) being about 70 mL/g. Start-Up Phase of Operation Prior to formal treatment of nitrate-containing raw water, the system operated in a start-up phase for 20 cycles. The bioreactor 2 and the bioreactor 3 both received 2.7 L of TiO2-modified denitrifying activated sludge (10 g/L), wherein TiO2 accounting for about 50% of the sludge mass. Then, the first bioreactor 2 was fed with 3 L of raw water (nitrate concentration 4.5 mM, pH 7.5, oxygen level 7.6-8.4 mg/L), and added with 40 mL of concentrated mixed organic carbon sources solution (107.2 mM acetic acid, 53.6 mM ethanol) through a peristaltic pump. The amount of mixed organic carbon sources added accounted for 68.4% of that required for completely removing nitrate from the raw water through heterotrophic. denitrification. Water in the first bioreactor 2 was treated for 4 h for nitrate removal with intermittent anaerobic aeration (20 s anaerobic aeration, 9 min idling), settled for 40 min, and then drained (3 L) into the second bioreactor 3, And then the second bioreactor 3 was added with 12 mL of concentrated mixed organic carbon sources solution (107.2 mM acetic acid, 53.6 mM ethanol). The amount of mixed organic carbon sources added accounted for 20.5% of that required for completely removing nitrate from the raw water through heterotrophic denitrification. The second bioreactor was also added with 150 mL of hydrogen gas intermittently provided by the electrolytic hydrogen production device 9 (50 mL each time at a time interval of one hour, altogether 3 times), operated for nitrate and nitrite removal for 4 h with intermittent anaerobic aeration (20 s anaerobic aeration, 2 min idling). Then, water in the second bioreactor 3 was settled for 40 min and drained (3 L) into the settling tank 4. Water in the settling tank 4 was settled for 2 h, and then discharged 3 L water. The TiO2-containing precipitates in the settling tank 4 were transferred into the precipitates treatment tank 7. In the start-up phase of operation, the water discharged from the settling tank 4 was neither disinfected with ozone nor filtered through activated carbon. The entire system operated for 5 h for each cycle in sequencing batch mode with water drainage in a reverse order as follows: from the settling tank 4, from the second bioreactor 3 into the settling tank 4, from the first bioreactor 2 into the second bioreactor 3, and from the raw water tank 1 into the first bioreactor 2. The entire system operated for 20 cycles to complete the start-up phase. In addition, after 10 cycles of operation, TiO2-containing precipitates collected from the settling tank 4 were sequentially treated with 40 mM NaOH and 20 mM HCl in the precipitates treatment tank 7, for 12 hours respectively, and then washed to neutral pH and injected into the first bioreactor 2. Formal operation When the start-up phase of operation was completed, the system formally operated to remove nitrate from raw water under room temperature condition (20-26° C.). The first bioreactor 2 was fed with 3 L of raw water (42 mgN/L nitrate, pH 7.5, 2.2 mg/L water soluble organic carbon, 7.6-8.4 mg/L oxygen), and added with 27 mL of concentrated mixed organic carbon sources solution (107.2 mM acetic acid, 53.6 mM ethanol) through a peristaltic pump. The amount of mixed organic carbon sources added accounted for 69.2% of that required for completely removing nitrate from the raw water through heterotrophic denitrification. Water in the first bioreactor was treated for 120 min with nitrate being partially removed and nitrite accumulated due to shortage of organic carbon sources, settled for 30 min, and drained (3 L) into the second bioreactor 3. The second bioreactor was added with 7 mL of concentrated mixed organic carbon sources solution (107.2 mM acetic acid, 53.6 mM ethanol). The amount of mixed organic carbon sources added accounted for 18.0% of that required for completely removing nitrate from the raw water through heterotrophic denitrification. The second bioreactor was also added with 120 mL hydrogen gas intermittently provided by the electrolytic hydrogen production device 9 (30 mL each time at a time interval of 30 min, altogether 4 times), and operated for 120 min with intermittent anaerobic aeration (20 s anaerobic aeration, 2 min idling) for reducing the residual nitrate and accumulated nitrite into nitrogen gas. Then water in the second bioreactor was settled for 30 min and drained (3 L) into the settling tank 4. Water in the settling tank 4 was settled for 90 min and drained (3 L) into the filtration tank 5, and TiO2-containing precipitates collected in the settling tank were transferred into the precipitates treatment tank 7. The water in the filtration tank 5 was intermittently disinfected by ozone (30 s disinfection, 2 min idling) for 15 min before 3 L of the disinfected water slowly flowed through the bottom-part activated carbon layer in 60 min into the storage tank 6 to complete one cycle of water processing. The entire system operated for 3 h for each cycle in sequencing batch mode with water drainage in a reverse order as follows: from the filtration tank 5 into the storage tank 6, from the settling tank 4 into the filtration tank 5, from the second bioreactor 3 into the settling tank 4, from the first bioreactor 2 into the second bioreactor 3, and from the raw water tank 1 into the first bioreactor 2. After 20 cycles of operation, TiO2-containing precipitates collected from the settling tank 4 were sequentially treated with 40 mM NaOH and 20 mM HCl in the precipitates treatment tank 7, for 12 hours respectively, and then washed to neutral pH and injected into the first bioreactor 2. The whole system operated stably. The contents of nitrate, nitrite and soluble organic carbon (SOC) in the final effluent collected in the storage tank 6 met the safety requirements of drinking water and the water pH and bicarbonate alkalinity were suitable (Table 1).
