(8) Preparation of (2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylic acid
(2S,5R)-ethyl6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylate (40.8 g, 134.06 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (900 mL), a solution of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (5.5 g, 131.08 mmol) in water (300 mL) was added dropwise. After addition. the reaction was performed at room temperature overnight. Water (200 mL) was added, ethyl acetate (500 mL ×2) was used for extraction, the aqueous phase was collected, regulated with 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid to pH=3, extracted with dichloromethane (200 mL ×3), the organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated to obtain the title compound as a white solid (25 g, yield 67%).
