Example 29: n-Butylamine Formylation Reaction Catalyzed by Using One of Ten Thousand of Molar Equivalent of Ruthenium Complex 1a
Steps similar to those in example 24 were employed, ruthenium complex 1a (1.2 mg, 0.002 mmol) was used as catalyst, and a reaction among n-butylamine (1.470 g, 20 mmol) and CO2 and H2 (each at a pressure of 35 atm) was performed in a Parr autoclave at 120Â° C. in an oil bath for 16 hours. N-n-butylformamide was separated and obtained as a colorless liquid (1.532 g) in 76% yield.
