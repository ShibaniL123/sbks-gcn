2-((3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl 2-(2-methyl-H-indol-1-yl)acetate
Step 1: 3,5-dimethyl-4-nitro-1-phenyl-1 H-pyrazole
A mixture of 3,5-dimethyl-4-nitro-1 H-pyrazole (see international patent application WO 2003057673) (3.982 g, 28.22 mmol), iodobenzene (11.3 mL, 101.4 mmol), K2CO3 (8.19 g, 59.26 mmol), CuI (268.8 mg, 1.41 mmol), and trans-N,N'-di-methylcyclohexane-1,2-diamine (890 µL, 5.63 mmol) were heated to 180 °C in a microwave reactor for 4 h under argon. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with EtOAc (250 mL), filtered through celite, and the product was purified by column chromatography (30→40→75% EtOAc in petroleum ether) to give 4.428 g (72%) of the title compound
