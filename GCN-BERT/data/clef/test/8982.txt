STABLE FACTOR VIII FORMULATIONS WITH LOW SUGAR-GLYCINE Cross-Reference to Related Applications [0001] This application is based on and claims priority of 61/973,281 filed April 01, 2014. FIELD [0002] This application relates generally to pharmaceutical formulations and particularly to lyophilized formulations for Factor VIII (FVIII) which is stabilized and with low amounts of sugar and glycine as protein stabilizers in a high ionic strength matrix, but without albumin (albumin- free) . BACKGROUND [0003] There are a number of albumin-free recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) formulations on the market using stabilization and formulation matrix excipients, such as sodium chloride, glycine, mannitol, sucrose, trehalose, histidine, and calcium chloride. Albumin-Free formulations of Factor VIII are believed to require an amorphous matrix for the protein in the presence of large amounts of crystallized excipients to provide an elegant cake structure. Hence, Factor VIII has been formulated in high salt formulations, high glycine, and high mannitol formulations where these excipients are purposely crystallized out during the freezing phase of lyophilization by annealing the frozen matrix to the eutectie crystallization temperature of the erystallizing excipent. A small axnotmt of stabilizer:/, preferably sucrose or trehalose, is added to the formulation for protection and stabilization of the Factor VIII in the amorphous, matrix of the Lyophite . SUMMARY [0004] The albumin-free formulation of Factor VTXI in. a high salt, low sucrose and low glycine matrix is a lyophilized formulation that is a pharmaceutically- acceptable drug product suitable for treating hemophilia. The addition of small amounts of glycine to the formulation surprisingly resulted in good cake structure, high recovery of FVIII. activity across lyophilization, and a stability profile that was similar to the formulation containing only sucrose in high salt matrix. The addition of the small- amount of glycine (3-6 mg/ml, 40-80 IOM) also surprising increased the primary glass transition temperature of the frozen matrix from -45 °c to -38 °C making the formulation easier to lyophilize . Since Factor VIII favors environments with high NaCl, the sucrose/giycine frozen matrix also appears to have higher NaCl content than the sucrose matrix alone. This surprising observation may also favor enhanced stability for a lyophilized Factor VIII formulation . [0005] The invention provides a stable, albumin-free lyophilized FVIII preparation, comprising, when reconstituted in water up to about 300 to 320 mM NaCl, up to about 50 mM buffer, preferably histidine, capable of providing a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.5, up to about 1-5 mM CaCl2, up to about 10-25 mM of a disaccharide, preferably sucrose or trehalose, up to about 20 to 80 mM glycine and up to about 50-2000 IU Factor VIII per milliliter. In addition, the composition may contain a non-ionic surfactant, preferably Tween-20 (polysorbate 20) or Tween-80 (polysorbate 80) in an amount above the critical micelle concentration, preferably at concentration between 50-150 ppm. The preferred FVIII is B-domain deleted rFVIII with a specific activity between 8,000 and 15,000 IU per milligram as determined by the chromogenic assay. [0006] The preferred stable, albumin-free lyophilized recombinant FVIII preparation, when reconstituted in water, is composed of, up to about 308 mM NaCl, up to about 50 mM of histidine, capable of providing a pH of 6.5 to 7.5, up to about 1 to 5 mM CaCl2, up to about 10-25 mM of sucrose or trehalose, up to about 40-80 mM Glycine and up to about 50-3000 IU B Domain Deleted recombinant Factor VIII.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OBJECTIVES [0017] The objective of this work is to provide a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation of Factor VIII that is stable in the absence of albumin. FVIII is preferably recombinant FVIII (rFVIII, most preferably B Domain Deleted rFVIII (BDDrFVI II ) . We found that the use of a sugar, preferably a disaccharide, most preferably sucrose or trehalose, in combination with glycine provides such stability and provides good cake formation after lyophilization. The preferred sugar concentration is 10-25 mM. [0018] In particular, the present invention comprises of a small amount of glycine, 20 - 80 mM, preferably 40-80 mM, 0.3-0.6 wt %, is added to a high ionic strength formulation comprising of around 250-400 mM NaCl, preferably 250-320 mM NaCl, most preferably 308 mM {18 mg/ml) . Surprising the addition of glycine appears to prevent some of the NaCl from crystallizing out during freezing and hence provide a stabilizing amorphous salt/sucrose/glycine matrix for FVIII. [0019] The glycine addition to the formulation increases the primary glass transition temperature of the formulation matrix by almost 7 °C, hence making the formulation easier to lyophxlize at a higher shelf temperature during primary drying. The small amount of glycine also results in generating a good cake structure for this formulation and does not comprise the overall stability of the lyophilized product. Both the NaCl/sucrose and NaCl/sucrose/glycine formulations have similar stability profiles. [0020] Other components may be added such as a buffer, capable of providing a pH of about 6.5 to about 7.5. A preferred buffer is histidine. Also a nonionic surfactant, such as polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) or polysorbate 20 (Tween 20) , at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration, may be added. In addition, CaC12 in a concentration of 1 - 5 mM may be added to preferred preparations. SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS EXAMPLE 1 [0021] The thermal properties of FVIII formulations in high ionic strength containing sucrose alone and in sucrose/glycine were characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) . As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the addition of low amounts of glycine surprising resulted in increasing the primary glass transition of the formulation matrix by almost 7 °C. The amount of crystallized NaCl in the sucrose/glycine matrix was almost half the crystallization in the sucrose alone formulation as shown by the enthalpic energy of eutectic melting of NaCl at -21 to -23 °C. These results strongly suggest that sucrose/glycine matrix contains significantly higher amounts of amorphous NaCl . EXAMPLE 2 [0022] A multivariate Design Of Experiments (DOE) was performed on FVIII formulations evaluating the effects of multiple excipients on the lyophilized formulations. Parameters such as recovery of FVIII activity across lyophilization, appearance of cake structure, and stability under accelerated conditions (8 weeks storage at 40 °C) were evaluated. [0023] Figures 3-5 show the DOE analysis of these formulations. The shaded areas on the graphs in Figure 3 show areas of high recovery across lyophilization. Good cake structure was evaluated by a qualitative ranking system from 1-5, where 5 is a good solid cake and 1 is a collapsed cake. Figure 4 shows the DOE results of the cake structure. Excellent cake structure was observed in the shaded circle where the formulations had low amounts of sucrose and glycine at salt concentrations. Figure 5 shows the stability data where good stability was observed in formulations with low amounts of sucrose and glycine as illustrated by the shaded circle area on the graph. [0024] Together the results show that formulations with low amounts of sucrose and glycine gave high recoveries across lyophilization, good cake structure, and excellent stability under accelerated temperatures (40 °C) over an eight week storage period. EXAMPLE 3 [0025] Stability of FVIII in formulations of high salt (308 mM) and low amounts of sucrose (18 mM) (solid line in Figures 6 and 7) or in low amounts of sucrose (6 mg/ml, 18 mM) and glycine (3 mg/ml, 80 mM) (dashed line in Figures 6 and 7} were evaluated over 12 weeks of storage at 2-8 °C and at accelerated temperature of 40 °C. Figure 6 shows the 2-8 °C stability data and Figure 7 shows the 40 °C stability data. Both formulations show similar stability profiles for both formulations over the 12 weeks of the study. EXAMPLE 4 [0026] Stability of FVIII in formulations of at a high dosage form of 2000 IU/vial and low dosage form at 250 IU/vial at different storage conditions are shown in Figures 8, 9, and 10. Two formulations containing high salt (308 mM) and low amounts of sucrose (18 mM) (bars with dots in Figures 8, 9 and 10) or high salt (308 mM) and in low amounts of sucrose (6 mg/ml, 18 mM) and glycine (3 mg/ml, 80 mM) (bars with horizontal lines in Figures 8, 9 and 10) were evaluated over 16 weeks of storage at 2-8 °C and over 12 weeks at accelerated temperatures of 25 °C and 40 °C. Both formulations show similar stability profiles for both formulations over the 12 weeks of the study.
