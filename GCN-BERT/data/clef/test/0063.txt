STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT Aspects of the work described herein were supported by National Institutes of Health Grant -1 R43 CA176957-01. The United States Government may have certain rights in this invention. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates generally to novel chimeric antigen receptors with binding specificity to ανβ6 integrin which is displayed on cell surfaces. In adults, ανβό integrin is, generally, uniquely displayed on cancer cells providing a vehicle and method to specifically target cancer cells for therapy. BACKGROUND Pancreatic cancer represents the 10th most common cancer diagnosis, yet the 4th most common estimated cause of death. The only potential curative therapy for pancreatic cancer is surgical resection; however, few patients have tumors that can be resected. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which represents 90% of pancreatic cancers, is particularly aggressive, since it rapidly metastasizes and often expresses growth factors and signaling components that permit rapid growth. Alternative therapies are desperately needed, as there have been no recent medical advances for treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. INTRODUCTION TO THE INVENTION There are many treatments and proposed treatments for cancer or pancreatic cancer. One general area of cancer research involves immunotherapy by adoptive transfer of engineered T cells that are intended to mediate cancer regression and overcome evasive mechanisms by which tumors avoid immune responses. There are various techniques of T-cell modification. One technique for modifying T-cells is to create chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) that are introduced into the T-cells.CAR are engineered fusion molecules comprising an antigen-binding motif and intracellular signaling domains. CAR can recognize tumor antigens independently of major histocompatiblity complex (MHC), expression of which is often lost by tumor cells. There are many cancer treatment proposals directed to treating cancer based on antigens expressed by the cancer cells. Finding a suitable target antigen, however, is difficult or even impossible. Cells naturally have many antigens and many of the same antigens. A cancer cell might not have any unique antigens, or there might not be any antigens unique to a cancer that is shared by enough of the cancer patient population to make developing a treatment possible. For example, others have made major research investments in the prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), and have made and tested CARs directed to PSCA 1. This research contributes to scientific progress but it now appears that PSCA may be shared by various normal tissues and might not be a suitable target antigen. Therefore, there is a need for identification of specific epitopes that are unique to cancer cells and was to target them that result in death of the cancer cell.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All publications and patents specifically mentioned herein are incorporated by reference for all purposes including describing and disclosing the chemicals, instruments, statistical analyses and methodologies which are reported in the publications which might be used in connection with the invention. All references cited in this specification are incorporated herein by reference. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the invention is not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of prior invention. The present disclosure is directed to research on the ability of several antigen-binding domains in the context of CAR to bind ανβό, an integrin that is highly expressed on pancreatic cancer cells. A CAR incorporating a peptide from foot-and-mouth disease virus VP1 capsid protein, a human IgG Fc spacer region, a transmembrane spanning domain and a fusion of intracellular signaling domains from CD28 and CD3zeta provided the highest level of binding to ανβό. Primary T-cells were then engineered for CAR expression using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system. Artificial antigen presenting cells expressing νβό integrin protein were engineered for specific expansion of CAR-expressing primary T cells. Functional activation of the assembled CAR in primary T-cells was determined by secretion of IFNy upon exposure of the engineered T cells to either ανβό protein or ανβ6+ pancreatic cancer cells. These results demonstrate the feasibility of assembling CAR to target ανβό integrin and support anticipated antitumor activity of these cells in preclinical studies and ultimately in the treatment of human pancreatic cancer. Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) are engineered molecules, consisting of an extracellular antigen-binding motif fused to intracellular signaling domains, which permit cellular activation upon ligand binding. Unlike endogenous T cell receptors, which bind to antigens in the context of MHC molecules, CAR have the advantage of recognizing tumor antigens in the absence of antigen processing pathways and MHC expression 2. Importantly, CARs do not have to be matched to the patient's MHC and can recognize tumor that has reduced expression of MHC. Target antigens of CARs currently are limited to cell surface proteins, reviewed recently by 3. The majority of tumors do not express any co-stimulatory molecules, and therefore co- stimulatory domains must be incorporated into the CAR molecule for efficient T cell activation. Early versions of CARs ("first generation") contained a binding domain, typically an antibody- derived single chain variable region (scFv) and the intracellular signaling domain from CD3ζ, which mediates antigen-specific cytotoxic activity and IL-2 production in murine T-cell hybridomas 4. CD3ζ is an intracellular component of the T cell receptor complex that transmits signal to activate T cells. Expression of the combination of a scFv and ΟΌ3ζ chain was not sufficient to activate resting T cells from transgenic mice 5. "Second generation" CARs have incorporated a co-stimulatory domain in addition to CD3ζ activation domain. The addition of the signaling domain from CD28 augments the ability of receptors to stimulate cytokine secretion and enhance antitumor activity in animal models 6'7. In addition, the CD28 costimulatory domain enhances the resistance of CAR+ T cells to regulatory T cells 8 and improves in vivo persistence in human patients compared to CARs encoding only the CD3ζ activation domain 9. CD 137 (4- IBB) protein, a member of the TNF receptor family, is expressed by T cells after antigen-receptor signaling occurs, and can mediate survival signaling by T cells 10. The combination of 4- IBB and CD3ζ intracellular signaling domains with either an anti-CD 19 or anti-mesothelin scFv demonstrated extended T cell persistence in mouse xenograft models compared to the combination of CD28 and CD3ζ signaling domains 1 2. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that the combination of 4- IBB and CD3ζ intracellular signaling domains with anti-CD 19 CAR mediates T cell persistence and have resulted in dramatically positive patient outcomes 13'14. Integrins are alpha-beta heterodimeric glycoproteins that mediate adhesion between cells and act as a bridge between cells and the extracellular matrix 15'16. Integrins additionally serve as a bidirectional interface between the cell and its environment to regulate signal transduction, cellular differentiation, migration, and proliferation 17~20. Integrins in the alpha V family, including ανβΐ, ανβ3, ανβ5, ανβ6, and ανβ8 bind their ligands after recognition of a highly conserved arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) motif. Integrin ανβ6 binds to extracellular matrix proteins, including fibronectin, tenascin, and vitronectin 21_23. In addition, alphaV family integrins, including ανβό, bind to the precursors of ΤΰΡβΙ and ΤΘΡβ3 and mediate cleavage of latency-associated peptide (LAP) from functional TGFfi 21-24>25. ανβό is expressed by epithelial cells during development and wound healing, but expression is low or absent in adult tissue 26. Integrin ανβ6 constitutes a potentially effective target for T cell-based cancer therapy. Integrin ανβό is overexpressed by several types of carcinomas, including gastric carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, ovarian carcinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinomas 27'28. In a histological survey of adenocarcinomas of gastroenteropancreatic origin, aV 6 expression was strongest in pancreatic ductal carcinoma, compared to esophageal, gastric, and colon carcinoma 27. In addition, νβ6 is over-expressed by epithelial ovarian tumors 28, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas 29 , and non small cell lung cancer 30. Other studies using immunohistochemistry and immunoprecipitation have identified ανβό expression in cancer of the endometrium, basal cell, liver, colon, gastric, cervical squamous cell, oral SCC, pancreas, breast and ovary 49. Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) recognizes ανβό as its primary receptor 31. A component of the FMDV capsid, VP1 protein, contains a flexible loop (GH loop), including an RGD motif that mediates binding to ocVp6. FMDV can also binding to ανβ3 and ανβ8. A 20- mer peptide derived from FMDV serotype CM BFS (Table 1, A20-FMDV2) mediated the strongest binding to νβό compared to peptides derived from other FMDV serotypes or the latency associated peptide of TGFpi 32. In addition, peptides that bind ανβό integrin containing an RTD motif have been identified from synthetic libraries (Table 1) 33'34. Anti-ανβό binding domains have been used in studies for in vivo imaging of ανβ6+ cancers, including pancreatic cancer 35~39. TABLE 1 The inventors have created synthetic receptors ("chimeric antigen receptor" or CAR) containing 3ΐιΐϊ-ανβ6 binding domains from FMDV or synthetic peptide libraries which binds to carcinoma cells expressing ανβό integrin. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sleeping Beauty transposons Transposons were constructed using T2 inverted terminal repeat sequences as described 40, separated by 1,800 base pairs (bp) of bacterial sequence consisting of the ColEl bacterial origin of replication and kanamycin (Kan) resistance gene. The CLP promoter transcriptionally regulates CAR expression, which contains a CpG-less promoter element derived from pCpG- free-mcs (Life Technologies, San Diego, CA), consisting of murine CMV enhancer, CpG-free elongation factor 1-a (EFla) promoter and intron sequences 1. The rabbit beta globin polyadenylation signal in the pKT2/ZOG transposon 41 was replaced with the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (BGH A), by digesting plasmid pcDNA3.1(+) (Life Technologies) with Notl and Nhel and ligating to create pKT2/CLP-BGH pA transposon. Transposase plasmids Both pCMV-SBl 1 42 and pCMV-SBlOOx 3 were used in the described experiments. CAR-sequence assembly The CAR DNA sequence (FIG. 1 A) encodes a GM-CSF receptor alpha leader sequence (60 bp, MLLVTSLLCELPHPAFLL) (SEQ ID NO 17), anti-ανβό binding domain (24-60 bp, Table 1), a triple glycine linker (27 bp, GGGGSGGGS) (SEQ ID NO 18), human IgG4 corresponding to the Fc and hinge domains (684 bp, corresponding to amino acids 99 to 327, GenBank P01861), and the CD4 transmembrane domain (TM) (66 bp, from amino acids 219- 240, NP_001181943) (Fig 1A). The sequence was human codon optimized, substituting codons with those optimally used in mammals without altering the anticipated amino acid sequence, and synthesized by DNA 2.0 (Menlo Park, CA). The IgG4 hinge contains two point mutations: 1) substitution of proline for serine at residue 109 in the hinge region to stabilize disulfide bonds between the heavy chains; 2) substitution of glutamic acid for leucine at residue 116 in the CH2 region to reduce binding to FcyRI and activation of macrophages, monocytes and natural killer cells 44. The CAR sequence was digested with Bsm l and Notl and ligated into transposon pKT2/CLP-BGH pA between Ncol to Notl sites to generate pKT2/CLP-CAR- BGH polyA. In one CAR transposon, double repeats of the Al 4 binding domain (Table 1) were fused by either the glycine-serine (GGGGSGGGS) (SEQ ID NO 18) or ARL linkers (GSTSGSGKPGSGEGSTKG) 45. Intracellular Signaling Domains In pKT2/anti-avp6-BBz, the CD4 TM domain was replaced by the CD8ct TM domain (84 bp, amino acids 183-209, GenBank NP_001759.3), and fused to CD137/ 4- IBB (141 bp, amino acids 208 to 255, GenBank NP_006130.1). This sequence was in turn fused to the cytoplasmic portion of the human CD247/ Ο03ζ molecule (339 bp, amino acids 51 to 164, GenBank NP_932170.1). In pKT2/anti-avp6-28z, the CD4 TM was replaced with the extracellular, transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions of human CD28, from amino acids IEVMY to the C-terminus (123 bp, GenBank NP_006130.1) 6, including a modification to remove a dileucine motif (RLLH --> RGGH 46) at amino acids 186 to 187. In anti-av 6-28BBz, the CD28 domain is fused in frame to the 4- 1 BB domain and the ΟΌ3ζ domain (FIG. 1 A). ARTIFICAL ANTIGEN PRESENTING CELLS EXPRESSING ανβ6 Integrin-encoding transposon construction Transposons contained a bi-directional promoter 47 , derived from pKT2-SE 40, with the CLP promoter transcriptionally regulating integrin expression. Drug-resistance genes puromycin-N-acetyltransferase or neomycin phosphotransferase were transcriptionally regulated by the PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase) promoter. Human integrin alpha V isoform 1 (ITGAV, Gene ID 3685, IMAGE clone BC126231) was PCR amplified using forward primer: 5'- attgatgaattcctccatggcttttcccccgcggcgacg -3' (SEQ ID NO 13) and reverse primer: 5'- gacatgctagcggccgcattaagtttctgagtttccttc -3' (restriction sites are underlined) (SEQ ID NO 14), digested with Ncol and Notl, then ligated into pKT2/CLP-PGK-neomycin to create pKT2/ITGAV-CLP-PGK-neomycin transposon. Human beta 6 integrin isoform A (ITGB6, GenelD 3693, IMAGE clone BC121178) was PCR amplified using forward primer: 5'- cactatgaattccgtctcacatggggattgaactgctttgcctg -3' (SEQ ID NO 15) and reverse primer 5'- tcatacactagtgcggccgcctagcaatctgtggaaaggtcta -3 ' (restriction sites are underlined) (SEQ ID NO 16), digested with Ncol and Notl, then ligated into pKT2-CLP-PGK-Puro to create pKT2/ITGB6-CLP-PGK-Puro transposon. K562 genetic modification and cloning K562 cells were electroporated using the Nucleofector I system (Lonza, Walkersville). One million cells in 100 μΐ of Ingenio buffer (Mirus) were electroporated using the Amaxa Nucleofector I program T-16 (Lonza) with a total of 7 μg transposon (1:3 molecular ratio of pKT2/ITGAV-CLP-PGK-neomycin to pKT2/ITGB6-CLP-PGK-Puromycin) and 2 μg of pCMV-SBl 1 (2:1 Tn:Ts ratio) 42. Two days post electroporation, cells were plated with 1.2 μg/ml G418 and 2 ^π puromycin (Calbiochem). Heterodimer expression of ανβ6 was determined by staining with mouse anti-avP6 antibody (clone 10D5, Millipore 23), followed by goat anti-mouse-IgG-AlexaFluor 647 (R&D Systems), and flow cytometry (LSRII, BD Biosciences). K562 cells were cultured for 12d providing fresh medium and selective agents three times weekly and then plated in methylcellulose (HSC002; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) containing G418 and puromycin. After incubating for 12 days, colonies were picked and screened for expression by flow cytometry with anti-avp6 antibody (clone 10D5, Millipore). The 562 clone exhibiting the highest ανβό expression (#3-5) was identified, expanded and cryopreserved. These cells were then used for antigen presentation after irradiation using an X-ray irradiator (100 Gy, Rad Source Technologies). CAR binding to ανβό integrin assay. Both A20 and Jurkat cell lines (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS. A20 cells (2 million) were electroporated in 200 μΐ of BTXpress buffer (Harvard Apparatus) using 2 mm cuvettes and a Cytopulse Electroporator, with 2 pulses at 900V/cm for 5 msec (Cytopulse). Jurkat cells (2 million) were mixed with 15 μg plasmid DNA and electroporated in 200 μΐ Ingenio buffer (Minis) using an Amaxa ucleofector I, program D-23 (Lonza). One day post electroporation, CAR expressing cells were washed in integrin binding buffer (25 mM Tris, pH7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MnCk, 1% BSA (Fraction V), 0.1% NaN3) and incubated with varying concentrations of recombinant soluble aVp6 (R&D Systems), followed by phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated-anti-aV antibody, (clone NKI-M9, Biolegend), and F(ab)2 antibody fragment goat anti-human IgG (Fey specific), conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 (Jackson Immunoresearch). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACsCalibur, BD). RESULTS Sleeping Beauty transposons encoding CAR were assembled with an anti-av 6 binding domain fused by glycine-serine linker to the hinge and Fc fragment of human IgG4 and transmembrane domain from CD4 but lacking any intracellular signaling domains (FIGs. 1A and IB). The binding domains have been characterized as binding ανβ6 integrin in different protein contexts, and used for imaging purposes 32-34>38>48. The ability of the assembled CAR containing a single repeat of an anti-avP6 domains (Table 1) to bind soluble ανβ6 integrin was assessed by flow cytometry after electroporation of a mouse B-cell line (A20 cells) with CAR- encoding transposon. CAR encoding the A14 and A20 binding domains from FMDV exhibited the highest level of binding to soluble ανβό integrin at the lowest ανβό integrin concentration assayed (5-10μΜ) (FIG. 2A). The TopPep#l-8 sequence did not bind soluble ανβό in this context. CAR containing A14 domain did not bind to soluble ανβ3, demonstrating CAR specificity (FIG. 2A). A doublet repeat of the A14 domain linked by flexible linkers exhibited reduced ability of CAR expressing cells to bind to soluble ανβ6 protein (FIG. 2B). A CAR encoding the A14 binding domain was assembled with CD3ζ intracellular signaling domain in combination with 4-1BB and/or CD28 signaling domains (FIG. 1A). After nucleofection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with CAR transposon, both CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells expressed all versions of CAR on their surface (FIG. 3). TABLE 2 CAR containing the A16 sequence from FMDV2 bound the best to soluble ανβό integrin protein (FIG. 4). A20 cells were electroporated with transposons encoding CAR containing one repeat of the indicated binding domains (Table 2). One day post electroporation, CAR expression was detected by staining with a goat anti-human IgG Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated antibody. Integrin ανβ6 binding was detected using anti-av PE monoclonal antibody (clone NKI-M9). Data are expressed as percentage of CAR+ cells. The percentage of C AR+ (hIgG+) cells binding to ανβ6 integrin is presented. Primary T cells stably express CAR in a donor dependent manner (FIG. 5). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two different donors (#46 and #44) were nucleofected (Amaxa Nucleofector I, U14 program) with SB transposon plasmids encoding A14- 41BB-CD3z CAR. A separate treatment group were nucleofected with the SB A14- 41BB-CD3z CAR as well as pCMV-SBlOOx at a ratio of 1 :3 and cultured in OpTmizer T cell expansion serum free media. One day post nucleofection, anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads were added with 50 IU/ml IL-2 to further stimulate T cells. On day 13 post nucleofection, cells were stained for CD3s, CD4, CD8 and anti-hlgG (CAR), and CAR+ cells were 90% CD8+.and 10% CD4+. Results are presented as percent of CAR+/CD3+ expressing cells of the total of mature CD3+ T cells. T cells expressing A14- 41BB-CD3z CAR secrete interferon-γ (IFNy) after exposure to ανβό protein or ανβ6+ pancreatic cancer cells (BxPC-3) (FIGs. 6A and 6B). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were activated for 6 d by culture with beads coated with anti-CD3/anti- CD28 antibodies (Life Technologies). Beads were removed, and cells were nucleofected (Amaxa Nucleofector) with SB transposon plasmid. One day post nucleofection, CAR+ T cells were plated with BxPC-3 cells (1 xlO4) or in plates coated with ανβό protein. Cell free media were collected 2 days later and assayed for IFN γ by ELISA (R&D Systems). As illustrated, CAR+ T cells secreted IFNy in response to either BxPC-3 or in response to pancreatic cancer cells (BxPC). BxPC-3 had the highest level of ανβό integrin expression amongst four pancreatic cancer cell lines, while AsPC-1 had little or no surface expression of ανβ6 (Data not shown). Human T cells expressing CAR (A 14-L4R or A 16) kill Capan 2 pancreatic cancer cells (FIG. 7). T cells expressing CAR with signaling domains 41BB-CD3z CAR kill pancreatic cancer cells (Capan 2) expressing ανβ6+ as measured by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) staining. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were activated for 7 d by culture with beads coated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies (Life Technologies). The beads were removed, and cells were nucleofected (Amaxa Nucleofector) with SB transposon plasmid encoding CAR or not. One day post nucleofection, T cells (5 xlO4) were plated with Capan-2 cells (1 xl 04) for 4h, followed by staining with 7AAD and analysis by flow cytometry. Samples were run in duplicate. To confirm the ubiquity of the ανβό integrin in pancreatic cancer, four different pancreatic cell lines were labeled with a fluorescent antibody to the ανβ6 integrin. These results FIG. 8 A confirm AsPC-1, Capan 1, BxPC-3 and Capan 2 express ανβό integrin. The fluorescent signal from AsPC-1 stained with 10D5 (grey) overlapped with that of the isotype control antibody. These results were confirmed by comparing pancreatic cell line to K562 cells artificially expressing ανβό integrin (FIG. 8B). Relative expression of ανβό integrin by Capan2 cells and K562 ανβ6+ clones. Expression of ανβό was detected after staining with antibody clone 10D5 or isotype control mouse IgG2b, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 647. These results have demonstrated that the combination of an anti- ανββ binding domain in the context of a CAR molecule can bind to ανβό integrin. In addition, the assembled CAR can mediate antigen-specific T cell activation when exposed to target carcinoma cells expressing ανβό. Further, the results provided herein show that T cell activation mediated by the CAR can result in cell death providing a vehicle to specifically target cancer cell to cause cell death.

These include all the sequences in Table 1, except for TopPep#l-8, which did not bind ανβ6. Certain embodiments of the invention include all combinations of the intracellular signaling domains that were assembled (see FIG. 1 A). Inventions include CAR expressing T cells, the cells being effective in mediating cytotoxicity against ανβό expressing pancreatic tumor cells both in vitro and/or in vivo. Certain embodiments of the invention include use of these cells for anti-tumor therapeutics against pancreatic or other ανβό expressing tumors.

As used herein, the term nucleic acid includes DNA, RNA, and nucleic acid analogs, and nucleic acids that are double-stranded or single-stranded (i.e., a sense or an antisense single strand). Nucleic acid analogs can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety, or phosphate backbone to improve, for example, stability, hybridization, or solubility of the nucleic acid. The deoxyribose phosphate backbone can be modified to produce morpholino nucleic acids. In addition, the deoxyphosphate backbone can be replaced with, for example, a phosphorothioate or phosphorodithioate backbone, a phosphoroamidite, or an alkyl phosphotriester backbone. A nucleic acid sequence can be operably linked to a regulatory region such as a promoter for expression. As used herein, operably linked refers to positioning of a regulatory region relative to a nucleic acid sequence in such a way as to permit or facilitate transcription of the target nucleic acid. Any type of promoter can be operably linked to a target nucleic acid sequence. Examples of promoters include, without limitation, tissue-specific promoters, constitutive promoters, and promoters responsive or unresponsive to a particular stimulus. Nucleic acid constructs can be introduced into embryonic, fetal, or adult cells of any type, including, for example, cells of the immune system, T-cells, antigen presenting cells, lymphocytes using a variety of techniques. Non-limiting examples of techniques include the use of transposon systems, recombinant viruses that can infect cells, or liposomes or other non- viral methods such as electroporation, microinjection, or calcium phosphate precipitation, that are capable of delivering nucleic acids to cells. In transposon systems, the transcriptional unit of a nucleic acid construct, i.e., the regulatory region operably linked to a target nucleic acid sequence, is flanked by an inverted repeat of a transposon. Several transposon systems, including, for example, Sleeping Beauty (see, U.S. Patent No. 6,613,752 and U.S. Publication No. 2005/0003542); Frog Prince (Miskey et al. (2003) Nucleic Acids Res. 31:6873); Toll (Kawakami (2007) Genome Biology 8(Suppl.l):S7; Minos (Pavlopoulos et al. (2007) Genome Biology 8(Suppl.l):S2); Hsmarl (Miskey et al. (2007) Mol Cell Biol. 27:4589); and Passport have been developed to introduce nucleic acids into cells, including mice, human, and pig cells. The Sleeping Beauty and Passport transposon is particularly useful. A transposase can be delivered as a protein, encoded on the same nucleic acid construct as the target nucleic acid, can be introduced on a separate nucleic acid construct, or provided as an mRNA (e.g., an in v tro-transcribed and capped mRNA). Nucleic acids can be incorporated into vectors. A vector is a broad term that includes any specific DNA segment that is designed to move from a carrier into a target DNA. A vector may be referred to as an expression vector, or a vector system, which is a set of components needed to bring about DNA insertion into a genome or other targeted DNA sequence such as an episome, plasmid, or even virus/phage DNA segment. Vector systems such as viral vectors (e.g., retroviruses, adeno-associated virus and integrating phage viruses), and non-viral vectors (e.g., transposons) used for gene delivery in animals have two basic components: 1) a vector comprised of DNA (or RNA that is reverse transcribed into a cDNA) and 2) a transposase, recombinase, or other integrase enzyme that recognizes both the vector and a DNA target sequence and inserts the vector into the target DNA sequence. Vectors most often contain one or more expression cassettes that comprise one or more expression control sequences, wherein an expression control sequence is a DNA sequence that controls and regulates the transcription and/or translation of another DNA sequence or mRNA, respectively. Many different types of vectors are known. For example, plasmids and viral vectors, e.g., retroviral vectors, are known. Mammalian expression plasmids typically have an origin of replication, a suitable promoter and optional enhancer, and also any necessary ribosome binding sites, apolyadenylation site, splice donor and acceptor sites, transcriptional termination sequences, and 5' flanking non-transcribed sequences. Examples of vectors include: plasmids (which may also be a carrier of another type of vector), adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), lentivirus (e.g., HIV-1, SIV or FIV), retrovirus (e.g., ASV, ALV or MoMLV), and transposons (e.g., Sleeping Beauty, P-elements, Tol-2, Frog Prince, piggyBac). As used herein, the term nucleic acid refers to both R A and DNA, including, for example, cDNA, genomic DNA, synthetic (e.g., chemically synthesized) DNA, as well as naturally occurring and chemically modified nucleic acids, e.g., synthetic bases or alternative backbones. A nucleic acid molecule can be double-stranded or single-stranded (i.e., a sense or an antisense single strand). The nucleic acid sequences set forth herein are intended to represent both DNA and RNA sequences, according to the conventional practice of allowing the abbreviation "T" stand for "T" or for "U", as the case may be, for DNA or RNA. Polynucleotides are nucleic acid molecules of at least three nucleotide subunits. Polynucleotide analogues or polynucleic acids are chemically modified polynucleotides or polynucleic acids. In some embodiments, polynucleotide analogues can be generated by replacing portions of the sugar-phosphate backbone of a polynucleotide with alternative functional groups. Morpholino-modified polynucleotides, referred to herein as "morpholinos," are polynucleotide analogues in which the bases are linked by a morpholino-phosphorodiamidate backbone (see, e.g., U.S . Patent Nos. 5,142,047 and 5,185,444). In addition to mo holinos, other examples of polynucleotide analogues include analogues in which the bases are linked by a polyvinyl backbone, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) in which the bases are linked by amide bonds formed by pseudopeptide 2-aminoethyl-glycine groups, analogues in which the nucleoside subunits are linked by methylphosphonate groups, analogues in which the phosphate residues linking nucleoside subunits are replaced by phosphoroamidate groups, and phosphorothioated DNAs, analogues containing sugar moieties that have 2' O-methyl group). Polynucleotides can be produced through the well-known and routinely used technique of solid phase synthesis. Alternatively, other suitable methods for such synthesis can be used (e.g., common molecular cloning and chemical nucleic acid synthesis techniques). Similar techniques also can be used to prepare polynucleotide analogues such as morpholinos or phosphorothioate derivatives. In addition, polynucleotides and polynucleotide analogues can be obtained commercially. For oligonucleotides, examples of pharmaceutically acceptable compositions are salts that include, e.g., (a) salts formed with cations such as sodium, potassium, ammonium, etc.; (b) acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid (c) salts formed with organic acids e.g., for example, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid; and (d) salts formed from elemental anions e.g., chlorine, bromine, and iodine. A sequence alignment is a way of arranging the sequences of DNA, RNA, or protein to identify regions of similarity. Aligned sequences of nucleotide or amino acid residues are typically represented as rows within a matrix, with gaps are inserted between the residues so that identical or similar characters are aligned in successive columns. A dministration The cells, including T-cells and other cells, may be modified to express CARs and administered to patients in a variety of ways. Autogenic cells taken from the patient are preferred, but cells from other sources may be used. One method involves collecting the cells from blood of the patient, modifying the cells ex vivo, and re-introducing them into the patient, e.g., by injection. Various molecules can be inserted into cells: vectors, drugs, DNA, proteins, or other molecules. In vivo modification of T-cells is also contemplated. mRNA and/or plasmids and/or vectors to express some or all of the CARs can be introduced into the cell ex vivo or in vivo. A patient may be treated one or more times. One process of ex vivo modification includes electroporation. Electroporation is a technology that has been used in research laboratories throughout the world for the past 20 years. The primary application has been in transfection of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. The process subjects cells to a pulsed electric field for a short duration, resulting in permeabilization of the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. This permeability develops in microseconds and resolves in seconds to minutes. While a physical "pore" has been observed under some circumstances, in most situations the permeability change is probably related to transient reorientation of membrane phospholipids. During the permeable period, both polar and non-polar molecules of various sizes can diffuse through the permeable areas according to concentration gradients. In addition, the electric field provides a force by which charged particles move into the cell ("electrophoretic" mechanism). Examples of re-introduction into the patient includes via injection, such as intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously, and in/with a pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, e.g., in solution and sterile vehicles, such as physiological buffers (e.g., saline solution or glucose serum).
