SEQUENCE LISTING The present application is being filed along with a Sequence Listing in electronic format. The Sequence Listing is provided as a file entitled BIOL0249USC1SEQ_ST25.txt, created on Dec. 30, 2014, which is 68 Kb in size. The information in the electronic format of the sequence listing is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The principle behind antisense technology is that an antisense compound hybridizes to a target nucleic acid and modulates the amount, activity, and/or function of the target nucleic acid. For example in certain instances, antisense compounds result in altered transcription or translation of a target. Such modulation of expression can be achieved by, for example, target mRNA degradation or occupancy-based inhibition. An example of modulation of RNA target function by degradation is RNase H-based degradation of the target RNA upon hybridization with a DNA-like antisense compound. Another example of modulation of gene expression by target degradation is RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi refers to antisense-mediated gene silencing through a mechanism that utilizes the RNA-induced siliencing complex (RISC). An additional example of modulation of RNA target function is by an occupancy-based mechanism such as is employed naturally by microRNA. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of protein-coding RNAs. The binding of an antisense compound to a microRNA prevents that microRNA from binding to its messenger RNA targets, and thus interferes with the function of the microRNA. MicroRNA mimics can enhance native microRNA function. Certain antisense compounds alter splicing of pre-mRNA. Regardless of the specific mechanism, sequence-specificity makes antisense compounds attractive as tools for target validation and gene functionalization, as well as therapeutics to selectively modulate the expression of genes involved in the pathogenesis of diseases. Antisense technology is an effective means for modulating the expression of one or more specific gene products and can therefore prove to be uniquely useful in a number of therapeutic, diagnostic, and research applications. Chemically modified nucleosides may be incorporated into antisense compounds to enhance one or more properties, such as nuclease resistance, pharmacokinetics or affinity for a target nucleic acid. In 1998, the antisense compound, Vitravene® (fomivirsen; developed by Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc., Carlsbad, Calif.) was the first antisense drug to achieve marketing clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is currently a treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-induced retinitis in AIDS patients. New chemical modifications have improved the potency and efficacy of antisense compounds, uncovering the potential for oral delivery as well as enhancing subcutaneous administration, decreasing potential for side effects, and leading to improvements in patient convenience. Chemical modifications increasing potency of antisense compounds allow administration of lower doses, which reduces the potential for toxicity, as well as decreasing overall cost of therapy. Modifications increasing the resistance to degradation result in slower clearance from the body, allowing for less frequent dosing. Different types of chemical modifications can be combined in one compound to further optimize the compound's efficacy. Apolipoprotein C-III (also called APOC3, APOC-III, ApoCIII, and APO C-III) is a constituent of HDL and of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins. Elevated ApoCIII levels are associated with elevated TG levels and diseases such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity and diabetes (Chan et al., Int J Clin Pract, 2008, 62:799-809; Onat et at., Atherosclerosis, 2003, 168:81-89; Mendivil et al., Circulation, 2011, 124:2065-2072; Mauger et al., J. Lipid Res, 2006. 47: 1212-1218; Chan et al., Clin. Chem, 2002. 278-283; Ooi et al., Clin. Sci, 2008. 114: 611-624; Davidsson et al., J. Lipid Res. 2005. 46: 1999-2006; Sacks et al., Circulation, 2000. 102: 1886-1892; Lee et al., Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol, 2003. 23: 853-858). ApoCIII slows clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins by inhibiting lipolysis through inhibition of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and through interfering with lipoprotein binding to cell-surface glycosaminoglycan matrix (Shachter, Curr. Opin. Lipidol, 2001, 12, 297-304). Antisense technology is emerging as an effective means for reducing the expression of certain gene products and may prove to be uniquely useful in a number of therapeutic, diagnostic, and research applications for the modulation of ApoCIII. Antisense compounds targeting ApoCIII and associated methods for inhibiting ApoCIII have been previously disclosed (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,598,227, U.S. Pat. No. 7,750,141, PCT publication WO 2004/093783, PCT publication WO 2012/149495 and PCT/US14/016,546, all incorporated-by-reference herein). An antisense compound targeting ApoCIII, ISIS-APOCIIIRx, has been tested in a Phase I and II clinical trials. However, no antisense compounds targeting ApoCIII have been approved for commercial use, accordingly, there is still a need to provide patients with additional and more potent treatment options. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides conjugated antisense compounds. In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides conjugated antisense compounds comprising an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to a nucleic acid transcript. In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods comprising contacting a cell with a conjugated antisense compound comprising an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to a nucleic acid transcript. In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods comprising contacting a cell with a conjugated antisense compound comprising an antisense oligonucleotide and reducing the amount or activity of a nucleic acid transcript in a cell. The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) has been described previously. See e.g., Park et al., PNAS vol. 102, No. 47, pp 17125-17129 (2005). Such receptors are expressed on liver cells, particularly hepatocytes. Further, it has been shown that compounds comprising clusters of three N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligands are capable of binding to the ASGP-R, resulting in uptake of the compound into the cell. See e.g., Khorev et al., Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry, 16, 9, pp 5216-5231 (May 2008). Accordingly, conjugates comprising such GalNAc clusters have been used to facilitate uptake of certain compounds into liver cells, specifically hepatocytes. For example it has been shown that certain GalNAc-containing conjugates increase activity of duplex siRNA compounds in liver cells in vivo. In such instances, the GalNAc-containing conjugate is typically attached to the sense strand of the siRNA duplex. Since the sense strand is discarded before the antisense strand ultimately hybridizes with the target nucleic acid, there is little concern that the conjugate will interfere with activity. Typically, the conjugate is attached to the 3′ end of the sense strand of the siRNA. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 8,106,022. Certain conjugate groups described herein are more active and/or easier to synthesize than conjugate groups previously described. In certain embodiments of the present invention, conjugates are attached to single-stranded antisense compounds, including, but not limited to RNase H based antisense compounds and antisense compounds that alter splicing of a pre-mRNA target nucleic acid. In such embodiments, the conjugate should remain attached to the antisense compound long enough to provide benefit (improved uptake into cells) but then should either be cleaved, or otherwise not interfere with the subsequent steps necessary for activity, such as hybridization to a target nucleic acid and interaction with RNase H or enzymes associated with splicing or splice modulation. This balance of properties is more important in the setting of single-stranded antisense compounds than in siRNA compounds, where the conjugate may simply be attached to the sense strand. Disclosed herein are conjugated single-stranded antisense compounds having improved potency in liver cells in vivo compared with the same antisense compound lacking the conjugate. Given the required balance of properties for these compounds such improved potency is surprising. In certain embodiments, conjugate groups herein comprise a cleavable moiety. As noted, without wishing to be bound by mechanism, it is logical that the conjugate should remain on the compound long enough to provide enhancement in uptake, but after that, it is desirable for some portion or, ideally, all of the conjugate to be cleaved, releasing the parent compound (e.g., antisense compound) in its most active form. In certain embodiments, the cleavable moiety is a cleavable nucleoside. Such embodiments take advantage of endogenous nucleases in the cell by attaching the rest of the conjugate (the cluster) to the antisense oligonucleotide through a nucleoside via one or more cleavable bonds, such as those of a phosphodiester linkage. In certain embodiments, the cluster is bound to the cleavable nucleoside through a phosphodiester linkage. In certain embodiments, the cleavable nucleoside is attached to the antisense oligonucleotide (antisense compound) by a phosphodiester linkage. In certain embodiments, the conjugate group may comprise two or three cleavable nucleosides. In such embodiments, such cleavable nucleosides are linked to one another, to the antisense compound and/or to the cluster via cleavable bonds (such as those of a phosphodiester linkage). Certain conjugates herein do not comprise a cleavable nucleoside and instead comprise a cleavable bond. It is shown that that sufficient cleavage of the conjugate from the oligonucleotide is provided by at least one bond that is vulnerable to cleavage in the cell (a cleavable bond). In certain embodiments, conjugated antisense compounds are prodrugs. Such prodrugs are administered to an animal and are ultimately metabolized to a more active form. For example, conjugated antisense compounds are cleaved to remove all or part of the conjugate resulting in the active (or more active) form of the antisense compound lacking all or some of the conjugate. In certain embodiments, conjugates are attached at the 5′ end of an oligonucleotide. Certain such 5′-conjugates are cleaved more efficiently than counterparts having a similar conjugate group attached at the 3′ end. In certain embodiments, improved activity may correlate with improved cleavage. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides comprising a conjugate at the 5′ end have greater efficacy than oligonucleotides comprising a conjugate at the 3′ end (see, for example, Examples 56, 81, 83, and 84). Further, 5′-attachment allows simpler oligonucleotide synthesis. Typically, oligonucleotides are synthesized on a solid support in the 3′ to 5′ direction. To make a 3′-conjugated oligonucleotide, typically one attaches a pre-conjugated 3′ nucleoside to the solid support and then builds the oligonucleotide as usual. However, attaching that conjugated nucleoside to the solid support adds complication to the synthesis. Further, using that approach, the conjugate is then present throughout the synthesis of the oligonucleotide and can become degraded during subsequent steps or may limit the sorts of reactions and reagents that can be used. Using the structures and techniques described herein for 5′-conjugated oligonucleotides, one can synthesize the oligonucleotide using standard automated techniques and introduce the conjugate with the final (5′-most) nucleoside or after the oligonucleotide has been cleaved from the solid support. In view of the art and the present disclosure, one of ordinary skill can easily make any of the conjugates and conjugated oligonucleotides herein. Moreover, synthesis of certain such conjugates and conjugated oligonucleotides disclosed herein is easier and/or requires few steps, and is therefore less expensive than that of conjugates previously disclosed, providing advantages in manufacturing. For example, the synthesis of certain conjugate groups consists of fewer synthetic steps, resulting in increased yield, relative to conjugate groups previously described. Conjugate groups such as GalNAc3-10 in Example 46 and GalNAc3-7 in Example 48 are much simpler than previously described conjugates such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,106,022 or U.S. Pat. No. 7,262,177 that require assembly of more chemical intermediates. Accordingly, these and other conjugates described herein have advantages over previously described compounds for use with any oligonucleotide, including single-stranded oligonucleotides and either strand of double-stranded oligonucleotides (e.g., siRNA). Similarly, disclosed herein are conjugate groups having only one or two GalNAc ligands. As shown, such conjugates groups improve activity of antisense compounds. Such compounds are much easier to prepare than conjugates comprising three GalNAc ligands. Conjugate groups comprising one or two GalNAc ligands may be attached to any antisense compounds, including single-stranded oligonucleotides and either strand of double-stranded oligonucleotides (e.g., siRNA). In certain embodiments, the conjugates herein do not substantially alter certain measures of tolerability. For example, it is shown herein that conjugated antisense compounds are not more immunogenic than unconjugated parent compounds. Since potency is improved, embodiments in which tolerability remains the same (or indeed even if tolerability worsens only slightly compared to the gains in potency) have improved properties for therapy. In certain embodiments, conjugation allows one to alter antisense compounds in ways that have less attractive consequences in the absence of conjugation. For example, in certain embodiments, replacing one or more phosphorothioate linkages of a fully phosphorothioate antisense compound with phosphodiester linkages results in improvement in some measures of tolerability. For example, in certain instances, such antisense compounds having one or more phosphodiester are less immunogenic than the same compound in which each linkage is a phosphorothioate. However, in certain instances, as shown in Example 26, that same replacement of one or more phosphorothioate linkages with phosphodiester linkages also results in reduced cellular uptake and/or loss in potency. In certain embodiments, conjugated antisense compounds described herein tolerate such change in linkages with little or no loss in uptake and potency when compared to the conjugated full-phosphorothioate counterpart. In fact, in certain embodiments, for example, in Examples 44, 57, 59, and 86, oligonucleotides comprising a conjugate and at least one phosphodiester internucleoside linkage actually exhibit increased potency in vivo even relative to a full phosphorothioate counterpart also comprising the same conjugate. Moreover, since conjugation results in substantial increases in uptake/potency a small loss in that substantial gain may be acceptable to achieve improved tolerability. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, conjugated antisense compounds comprise at least one phosphodiester linkage. In certain embodiments, conjugation of antisense compounds herein results in increased delivery, uptake and activity in hepatocytes. Thus, more compound is delivered to liver tissue. However, in certain embodiments, that increased delivery alone does not explain the entire increase in activity. In certain such embodiments, more compound enters hepatocytes. In certain embodiments, even that increased hepatocyte uptake does not explain the entire increase in activity. In such embodiments, productive uptake of the conjugated compound is increased. For example, as shown in Example 102, certain embodiments of GalNAc-containing conjugates increase enrichment of antisense oligonucleotides in hepatocytes versus non-parenchymal cells. This enrichment is beneficial for oligonucleotides that target genes that are expressed in hepatocytes. In certain embodiments, conjugated antisense compounds herein result in reduced kidney exposure. For example, as shown in Example 20, the concentrations of antisense oligonucleotides comprising certain embodiments of GalNAc-containing conjugates are lower in the kidney than that of antisense oligonucleotides lacking a GalNAc-containing conjugate. This has several beneficial therapeutic implications. For therapeutic indications where activity in the kidney is not sought, exposure to kidney risks kidney toxicity without corresponding benefit. Moreover, high concentration in kidney typically results in loss of compound to the urine resulting in faster clearance. Accordingly for non-kidney targets, kidney accumulation is undesired. In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides conjugated antisense compounds represented by the formula: [in-line-formulae]A-B-C-DE-F)q [/in-line-formulae] wherein A is the antisense oligonucleotide; B is the cleavable moiety C is the conjugate linker D is the branching group each E is a tether; each F is a ligand; and q is an integer between 1 and 5.

As used herein, “conjugate linker” or “linker” in the context of a conjugate group means a portion of a conjugate group comprising any atom or group of atoms and which covalently link (1) an oligonucleotide to another portion of the conjugate group or (2) two or more portions of the conjugate group. Conjugate groups are shown herein as radicals, providing a bond for forming covalent attachment to an oligomeric compound such as an antisense oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments, the point of attachment on the oligomeric compound is the 3′-oxygen atom of the 3′-hydroxyl group of the 3′ terminal nucleoside of the oligomeric compound. In certain embodiments the point of attachment on the oligomeric compound is the 5′-oxygen atom of the 5′-hydroxyl group of the 5′ terminal nucleoside of the oligomeric compound.

As used herein “protecting group” means any compound or protecting group known to those having skill in the art. Non-limiting examples of protecting groups may be found in “Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry”, T. W. Greene, P. G. M. Wuts, ISBN 0-471-62301-6, John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As used herein, “single-stranded” means an oligomeric compound that is not hybridized to its complement and which lacks sufficient self-complementarity to form a stable self-duplex. As used herein, “double stranded” means a pair of oligomeric compounds that are hybridized to one another or a single self-complementary oligomeric compound that forms a hairpin structure. In certain embodiments, a double-stranded oligomeric compound comprises a first and a second oligomeric compound. As used herein, “antisense compound” means a compound comprising or consisting of an oligonucleotide at least a portion of which is complementary to a target nucleic acid to which it is capable of hybridizing, resulting in at least one antisense activity. As used herein, “antisense activity” means any detectable and/or measurable change attributable to the hybridization of an antisense compound to its target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, antisense activity includes modulation of the amount or activity of a target nucleic acid transcript (e.g. mRNA). In certain embodiments, antisense activity includes modulation of the splicing of pre-mRNA. As used herein, “RNase H based antisense compound” means an antisense compound wherein at least some of the antisense activity of the antisense compound is attributable to hybridization of the antisense compound to a target nucleic acid and subsequent cleavage of the target nucleic acid by RNase H. As used herein, “RISC based antisense compound” means an antisense compound wherein at least some of the antisense activity of the antisense compound is attributable to the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). As used herein, “detecting” or “measuring” means that a test or assay for detecting or measuring is performed. Such detection and/or measuring may result in a value of zero. Thus, if a test for detection or measuring results in a finding of no activity (activity of zero), the step of detecting or measuring the activity has nevertheless been performed. As used herein, “detectable and/or measureable activity” means a statistically significant activity that is not zero. As used herein, “essentially unchanged” means little or no change in a particular parameter, particularly relative to another parameter which changes much more. In certain embodiments, a parameter is essentially unchanged when it changes less than 5%. In certain embodiments, a parameter is essentially unchanged if it changes less than two-fold while another parameter changes at least ten-fold. For example, in certain embodiments, an antisense activity is a change in the amount of a target nucleic acid. In certain such embodiments, the amount of a non-target nucleic acid is essentially unchanged if it changes much less than the target nucleic acid does, but the change need not be zero. As used herein, “expression” means the process by which a gene ultimately results in a protein. Expression includes, but is not limited to, transcription, post-transcriptional modification (e.g., splicing, polyadenlyation, addition of 5′-cap), and translation. As used herein, “target nucleic acid” means a nucleic acid molecule to which an antisense compound is intended to hybridize to result in a desired antisense activity. Antisense oligonucleotides have sufficient complementarity to their target nucleic acids to allow hybridization under physiological conditions. As used herein, “nucleobase complementarity” or “complementarity” when in reference to nucleobases means a nucleobase that is capable of base pairing with another nucleobase. For example, in DNA, adenine (A) is complementary to thymine (T). For example, in RNA, adenine (A) is complementary to uracil (U). In certain embodiments, complementary nucleobase means a nucleobase of an antisense compound that is capable of base pairing with a nucleobase of its target nucleic acid. For example, if a nucleobase at a certain position of an antisense compound is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleobase at a certain position of a target nucleic acid, then the position of hydrogen bonding between the oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid is considered to be complementary at that nucleobase pair. Nucleobases comprising certain modifications may maintain the ability to pair with a counterpart nucleobase and thus, are still capable of nucleobase complementarity. As used herein, “non-complementary” in reference to nucleobases means a pair of nucleobases that do not form hydrogen bonds with one another. As used herein, “complementary” in reference to oligomeric compounds (e.g., linked nucleosides, oligonucleotides, or nucleic acids) means the capacity of such oligomeric compounds or regions thereof to hybridize to another oligomeric compound or region thereof through nucleobase complementarity. Complementary oligomeric compounds need not have nucleobase complementarity at each nucleoside. Rather, some mismatches are tolerated. In certain embodiments, complementary oligomeric compounds or regions are complementary at 70% of the nucleobases (70% complementary). In certain embodiments, complementary oligomeric compounds or regions are 80% complementary. In certain embodiments, complementary oligomeric compounds or regions are 90% complementary. In certain embodiments, complementary oligomeric compounds or regions are 95% complementary. In certain embodiments, complementary oligomeric compounds or regions are 100% complementary. As used herein, “mismatch” means a nucleobase of a first oligomeric compound that is not capable of pairing with a nucleobase at a corresponding position of a second oligomeric compound, when the first and second oligomeric compound are aligned. Either or both of the first and second oligomeric compounds may be oligonucleotides. As used herein, “hybridization” means the pairing of complementary oligomeric compounds (e.g., an antisense compound and its target nucleic acid). While not limited to a particular mechanism, the most common mechanism of pairing involves hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleobases. As used herein, “specifically hybridizes” means the ability of an oligomeric compound to hybridize to one nucleic acid site with greater affinity than it hybridizes to another nucleic acid site. As used herein, “fully complementary” in reference to an oligonucleotide or portion thereof means that each nucleobase of the oligonucleotide or portion thereof is capable of pairing with a nucleobase of a complementary nucleic acid or contiguous portion thereof. Thus, a fully complementary region comprises no mismatches or unhybridized nucleobases in either strand. As used herein, “percent complementarity” means the percentage of nucleobases of an oligomeric compound that are complementary to an equal-length portion of a target nucleic acid. Percent complementarity is calculated by dividing the number of nucleobases of the oligomeric compound that are complementary to nucleobases at corresponding positions in the target nucleic acid by the total length of the oligomeric compound. As used herein, “percent identity” means the number of nucleobases in a first nucleic acid that are the same type (independent of chemical modification) as nucleobases at corresponding positions in a second nucleic acid, divided by the total number of nucleobases in the first nucleic acid. As used herein, “modulation” means a change of amount or quality of a molecule, function, or activity when compared to the amount or quality of a molecule, function, or activity prior to modulation. For example, modulation includes the change, either an increase (stimulation or induction) or a decrease (inhibition or reduction) in gene expression. As a further example, modulation of expression can include a change in splice site selection of pre-mRNA processing, resulting in a change in the absolute or relative amount of a particular splice-variant compared to the amount in the absence of modulation. As used herein, “chemical motif” means a pattern of chemical modifications in an oligonucleotide or a region thereof. Motifs may be defined by modifications at certain nucleosides and/or at certain linking groups of an oligonucleotide. As used herein, “nucleoside motif” means a pattern of nucleoside modifications in an oligonucleotide or a region thereof. The linkages of such an oligonucleotide may be modified or unmodified. Unless otherwise indicated, motifs herein describing only nucleosides are intended to be nucleoside motifs. Thus, in such instances, the linkages are not limited. As used herein, “sugar motif” means a pattern of sugar modifications in an oligonucleotide or a region thereof. As used herein, “linkage motif” means a pattern of linkage modifications in an oligonucleotide or region thereof. The nucleosides of such an oligonucleotide may be modified or unmodified. Unless otherwise indicated, motifs herein describing only linkages are intended to be linkage motifs. Thus, in such instances, the nucleosides are not limited. As used herein, “nucleobase modification motif” means a pattern of modifications to nucleobases along an oligonucleotide. Unless otherwise indicated, a nucleobase modification motif is independent of the nucleobase sequence. As used herein, “sequence motif” means a pattern of nucleobases arranged along an oligonucleotide or portion thereof. Unless otherwise indicated, a sequence motif is independent of chemical modifications and thus may have any combination of chemical modifications, including no chemical modifications. As used herein, “type of modification” in reference to a nucleoside or a nucleoside of a “type” means the chemical modification of a nucleoside and includes modified and unmodified nucleosides. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, a “nucleoside having a modification of a first type” may be an unmodified nucleoside. As used herein, “differently modified” mean chemical modifications or chemical substituents that are different from one another, including absence of modifications. Thus, for example, a MOE nucleoside and an unmodified DNA nucleoside are “differently modified,” even though the DNA nucleoside is unmodified. Likewise, DNA and RNA are “differently modified,” even though both are naturally-occurring unmodified nucleosides. Nucleosides that are the same but for comprising different nucleobases are not differently modified. For example, a nucleoside comprising a 2′-OMe modified sugar and an unmodified adenine nucleobase and a nucleoside comprising a 2′-OMe modified sugar and an unmodified thymine nucleobase are not differently modified. As used herein, “the same type of modifications” refers to modifications that are the same as one another, including absence of modifications. Thus, for example, two unmodified DNA nucleosides have “the same type of modification,” even though the DNA nucleoside is unmodified. Such nucleosides having the same type modification may comprise different nucleobases. As used herein, “separate regions” means portions of an oligonucleotide wherein the chemical modifications or the motif of chemical modifications of any neighboring portions include at least one difference to allow the separate regions to be distinguished from one another.

Such mono and poly cyclic structures can contain rings that each have the same level of saturation or each, independently, have varying degrees of saturation including fully saturated, partially saturated or fully unsaturated. Each ring can comprise ring atoms selected from C, N, O and S to give rise to heterocyclic rings as well as rings comprising only C ring atoms which can be present in a mixed motif such as for example benzimidazole wherein one ring has only carbon ring atoms and the fused ring has two nitrogen atoms. The mono or polycyclic ring system can be further substituted with substituent groups such as for example phthalimide which has two ═O groups attached to one of the rings. Mono or polycyclic ring systems can be attached to parent molecules using various strategies such as directly through a ring atom, fused through multiple ring atoms, through a substituent group or through a bifunctional linking moiety. As used herein, “prodrug” means an inactive or less active form of a compound which, when administered to a subject, is metabolized to form the active, or more active, compound (e.g., drug). As used herein, “substituent” and “substituent group,” means an atom or group that replaces the atom or group of a named parent compound. For example a substituent of a modified nucleoside is any atom or group that differs from the atom or group found in a naturally occurring nucleoside (e.g., a modified 2′-substituent is any atom or group at the 2′-position of a nucleoside other than H or OH). Substituent groups can be protected or unprotected. In certain embodiments, compounds of the present disclosure have substituents at one or at more than one position of the parent compound. Substituents may also be further substituted with other substituent groups and may be attached directly or via a linking group such as an alkyl or hydrocarbyl group to a parent compound. Likewise, as used herein, “substituent” in reference to a chemical functional group means an atom or group of atoms that differs from the atom or a group of atoms normally present in the named functional group. In certain embodiments, a substituent replaces a hydrogen atom of the functional group (e.g., in certain embodiments, the substituent of a substituted methyl group is an atom or group other than hydrogen which replaces one of the hydrogen atoms of an unsubstituted methyl group).

As used herein, “diabetes mellitus” or “diabetes” is a syndrome characterized by disordered metabolism and abnormally high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) resulting from insufficient levels of insulin or reduced insulin sensitivity. The characteristic symptoms are excessive urine production (polyuria) due to high blood glucose levels, excessive thirst and increased fluid intake (polydipsia) attempting to compensate for increased urination, blurred vision due to high blood glucose effects on the eye's optics, unexplained weight loss, and lethargy. As used herein, “diabetic dyslipidemia” or “type 2 diabetes with dyslipidemia” means a condition characterized by Type 2 diabetes, reduced HDL-C, elevated triglycerides (TG), and elevated small, dense LDL particles. As used herein, “diluent” means an ingredient in a composition that lacks pharmacological activity, but is pharmaceutically necessary or desirable. For example, the diluent in an injected composition can be a liquid, e.g. saline solution. As used herein, “dyslipidemia” refers to a disorder of lipid and/or lipoprotein metabolism, including lipid and/or lipoprotein overproduction or deficiency. Dyslipidemias can be manifested by elevation of lipids such as chylomicron, cholesterol and triglycerides as well as lipoproteins such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. As used herein, “dosage unit” means a form in which a pharmaceutical agent is provided, e.g. pill, tablet, or other dosage unit known in the art. In certain embodiments, a dosage unit is a vial containing lyophilized antisense oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments, a dosage unit is a vial containing reconstituted antisense oligonucleotide. As used herein, “dose” means a specified quantity of a pharmaceutical agent provided in a single administration, or in a specified time period. In certain embodiments, a dose can be administered in one, two, or more boluses, tablets, or injections. For example, in certain embodiments where subcutaneous administration is desired, the desired dose requires a volume not easily accommodated by a single injection, therefore, two or more injections can be used to achieve the desired dose. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical agent is administered by infusion over an extended period of time or continuously. Doses can be stated as the amount of pharmaceutical agent per hour, day, week, or month. Doses can also be stated as mg/kg or g/kg. As used herein, “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” means the amount of active pharmaceutical agent sufficient to effectuate a desired physiological outcome in an individual in need of the agent. The effective amount can vary among individuals depending on the health and physical condition of the individual to be treated, the taxonomic group of the individuals to be treated, the formulation of the composition, assessment of the individual's medical condition, and other relevant factors. As used herein, “Fredrickson Type I” is also known as “Lipoprotein lipase deficiency”, “LPLD”, “Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome” or “FCS” and exists in several forms: Type 1a (also known as Buerger-Gruestz syndrome) is a lipoprotein lipase deficiency commonly due to a deficiency of LPL or altered ApoC-II; Type Ib (also known as familial apoprotein CII deficiency) is a condition caused by lack of lipoprotein lipase activator apoprotein C-II; and Type Ic is a chylomicronemia due to circulating inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase. Type I is a rare disorder that usually presents in childhood. It is characterized by severe elevations in chylomicrons and extremely elevated TG levels (always reaching well above 1000 mg/dL and not infrequently rising as high as 10,000 mg/dL or more) with episodes of abdominal pain, recurrent acute pancreatitis, eruptive cutaneous xanthomata, and hepatosplenomegaly. Patients rarely develop atherosclerosis, perhaps because their plasma lipoprotein particles are too large to enter into the arterial intima (Nordestgaard et al., J Lipid Res, 1988, 29:1491-1500; Nordestgaard et al., Arteriosclerosis, 1988, 8:421-428). Type I is usually caused by mutations of either the LPL gene, or of the gene's cofactor ApoC-II, resulting in the inability of affected individuals to produce sufficient functionally active LPL. Patients are either homozygous for such mutations or compound heterozygous. Fredrickson Type I can also be due to mutations in the GPIHBP1, APOA5, LMF1 or other genes leading to dysfunctional LPL. Brunzell, In: Pagon R A, Adam M P, Bird T D, Dolan C R, Fong C T, Stephens K, editors. GeneReviews™ [Internet]. Seattle (WA): University of Washington, Seattle; 1993-2013.1999 Oct. 12 [updated 2011 Dec. 15]. Further, Fredrickson Type I, in some instances, can be due to the presence of LPL inhibitors (e.g., anti-LPL antibodies) in an individual causing dysfunctional LPL. The prevalence of Fredrickson Type I is approximately 1 in 1,000,000 in the general population and much higher in South Africa and Eastern Quebec as a result of a founder effect. Patients respond minimally, or not at all, to TG-lowering drugs (Tremblay et al., J Clin Lipidol, 2011, 5:37-44; Brisson et al., Pharmacogenet Genom, 2010, 20:742-747) and hence restriction of dietary fat to 20 grams/day or less is used to manage the symptoms of this rare disorder. As used herein, “fully complementary” or “100% complementary” means each nucleobase of a nucleobase sequence of a first nucleic acid has a complementary nucleobase in a second nucleobase sequence of a second nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, a first nucleic acid is an antisense compound and a second nucleic acid is a target nucleic acid. As used herein, “glucose” is a monosaccharide used by cells as a source of energy and inflammatory intermediate. “Plasma glucose” refers to glucose present in the plasma. As used herein, “high density lipoprotein-C” or “HDL-C” means cholesterol associated with high density lipoprotein particles. Concentration of HDL-C in serum (or plasma) is typically quantified in mg/dL or nmol/L. “Serum HDL-C” and “plasma HDL-C” mean HDL-C in serum and plasma, respectively. As used herein, “HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor” means an agent that acts through the inhibition of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, such as atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. As used herein, “hypercholesterolemia” means a condition characterized by elevated cholesterol or circulating (plasma) cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and VLDL-cholesterol, as per the guidelines of the Expert Panel Report of the National Cholesterol Educational Program (NCEP) of Detection, Evaluation of Treatment of high cholesterol in adults (see, Arch. Int. Med. (1988) 148, 36-39). As used herein, “hyperlipidemia” or “hyperlipemia” is a condition characterized by elevated serum lipids or circulating (plasma) lipids. This condition manifests an abnormally high concentration of fats. The lipid fractions in the circulating blood are cholesterol, low density lipoproteins, very low density lipoproteins, chylomicrons and triglycerides. The Fredrickson classification of hyperlipidemias is based on the pattern of TG and cholesterol-rich lipoprotein particles, as measured by electrophoresis or ultracentrifugation and is commonly used to characterize primary causes of hyperlipidemias such as hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson and Lee, Circulation, 1965, 31:321-327; Fredrickson et al., New Eng J Med, 1967, 276 (1): 34-42). As used herein, “hypertriglyceridemia” means a condition characterized by elevated triglyceride levels. Hypertriglyceridemia is the consequence of increased production and/or reduced or delayed catabolism of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins: VLDL and, to a lesser extent, chylomicrons (CM). Its etiology includes primary (i.e. genetic causes) and secondary (other underlying causes such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance, obesity, physical inactivity, cigarette smoking, excess alcohol and a diet very high in carbohydrates) factors or, most often, a combination of both (Yuan et al. CMAJ, 2007, 176:1113-1120). Hypertriglyceridemia is a common clinical trait associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic disease (Hegele et al. 2009, Hum Mol Genet, 18: 4189-4194; Hegele and Pollex 2009, Mol Cell Biochem, 326: 35-43) as well as of occurrence of acute pancreatitis in the most severe forms (Toskes 1990, Gastroenterol Clin North Am, 19: 783-791; Gaudet et al. 2010, Atherosclerosis Supplements, 11: 55-60; Catapano et al. 2011, Atherosclerosis, 217S: S1-S44; Tremblay et al. 2011, J Clin Lipidol, 5: 37-44). Examples of cardiometabolic disease include, but are not limited to, diabetes, metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance, and genetic disorders such as familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), familial combined hyperlipidemia and familial hypertriglyceridemia. Borderline high TG levels (150-199 mg/dL) are commonly found in the general population and are a common component of the metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance states. The same is true for high TG levels (200-499 mg/dL) except that as plasma TG levels increase, underlying genetic factors play an increasingly important etiologic role. Very high TG levels (≧500 mg/dL) are most often associated with elevated CM levels as well, and are accompanied by increasing risk for acute pancreatitis. The risk of pancreatitis is considered clinically significant if TG levels exceed 880 mg/dL (>10 mmol) and the European Atherosclerosis Society/European Society of Cardiology (EAS/ESC) 2011 guidelines state that actions to prevent acute pancreatitis are mandatory (Catapano et al. 2011, Atherosclerosis, 217S: S1-S44). According to the EAS/ESC 2011 guidelines, hypertriglyceridemia is the cause of approximately 10% of all cases of pancreatitis, and development of pancreatitis can occur at TG levels between 440-880 mg/dL. Based on evidence from clinical studies demonstrating that elevated TG levels are an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic CVD, the guidelines from both the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel 111 (NCEP 2002, Circulation, 106: 3143-421) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA 2008, Diabetes Care, 31: S12-S54.) recommend a target TG level of less than 150 mg/dL to reduce cardiovascular risk. As used herein, “identifying” or “selecting an animal with metabolic or cardiovascular disease” means identifying or selecting a subject prone to or having been diagnosed with a metabolic disease, a cardiovascular disease, or a metabolic syndrome; or, identifying or selecting a subject having any symptom of a metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, or metabolic syndrome including, but not limited to, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension increased insulin resistance, decreased insulin sensitivity, above normal body weight, and/or above normal body fat content or any combination thereof. Such identification can be accomplished by any method, including but not limited to, standard clinical tests or assessments, such as measuring serum or circulating (plasma) cholesterol, measuring serum or circulating (plasma) blood-glucose, measuring serum or circulating (plasma) triglycerides, measuring blood-pressure, measuring body fat content, measuring body weight, and the like. As used herein, “improved cardiovascular outcome” means a reduction in the occurrence of adverse cardiovascular events, or the risk thereof. Examples of adverse cardiovascular events include, without limitation, death, reinfarction, stroke, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, cardiac arrest, and atrial dysrhythmia. As used herein, “immediately adjacent” means there are no intervening elements between the immediately adjacent elements, for example, between regions, segments, nucleotides and/or nucleosides. As used herein, “increasing HDL” or “raising HDL” means increasing the level of HDL in an animal after administration of at least one compound of the invention, compared to the HDL level in an animal not administered any compound. As used herein, “individual” or “subject” or “animal” means a human or non-human animal selected for treatment or therapy. As used herein, “individual in need thereof” refers to a human or non-human animal selected for treatment or therapy that is in need of such treatment or therapy. As used herein, “induce”, “inhibit”, “potentiate”, “elevate”, “increase”, “decrease”, “reduce” or the like denote quantitative differences between two states. For example, “an amount effective to inhibit the activity or expression of apoCIII” means that the level of activity or expression of apoCIII in a treated sample will differ from the level of apoCIII activity or expression in an untreated sample. Such terms are applied to, for example, levels of expression, and levels of activity. As used herein, “inflammatory condition” refers to a disease, disease state, syndrome, or other condition resulting in inflammation. For example, rheumatoid arthritis and liver fibrosis are inflammatory conditions. Other examples of inflammatory conditions include sepsis, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury, adult respiratory distress syndrome, nephritis, graft rejection, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis and vasculitis. As used herein, “inhibiting the expression or activity” refers to a reduction or blockade of the expression or activity of a RNA or protein and does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of expression or activity. As used herein, “insulin resistance” is defined as the condition in which normal amounts of insulin are inadequate to produce a normal insulin response from fat, muscle and liver cells. Insulin resistance in fat cells results in hydrolysis of stored triglycerides, which elevates free fatty acids in the blood plasma. Insulin resistance in muscle reduces glucose uptake whereas insulin resistance in liver reduces glucose storage, with both effects serving to elevate blood glucose. High plasma levels of insulin and glucose due to insulin resistance often leads to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. As used herein, “insulin sensitivity” is a measure of how effectively an individual processes glucose. An individual having high insulin sensitivity effectively processes glucose whereas an individual with low insulin sensitivity does not effectively process glucose. As used herein, “lipid-lowering” means a reduction in one or more lipids (e.g., LDL, VLDL) in a subject. “Lipid-raising” means an increase in a lipid (e.g., HDL) in a subject. Lipid-lowering or lipid-raising can occur with one or more doses over time. As used herein, “lipid-lowering therapy” or “lipid lowering agent” means a therapeutic regimen provided to a subject to reduce one or more lipids in a subject. In certain embodiments, a lipid-lowering therapy is provided to reduce one or more of apo(a), apoCIII, CETP, apoB, total cholesterol, LDL-C, VLDL-C, IDL-C, non-HDL-C, triglycerides, small dense LDL particles, and Lp(a) in a subject. Examples of lipid-lowering therapy include, but are not limited to, apoB inhibitors, statins, fibrates and MTP inhibitors. As used herein, “lipoprotein”, such as VLDL, LDL and HDL, refers to a group of proteins found in the serum, plasma and lymph and are important for lipid transport. The chemical composition of each lipoprotein differs, for example, in that the HDL has a higher proportion of protein versus lipid, whereas the VLDL has a lower proportion of protein versus lipid. As used herein, “Lipoprotein Lipase” or “LPL” refers to an enzyme that hydrolyzes TGs found in lipoproteins, such as CM or VLDL, into free fatty acids and monoacylglycerols. LPL requires apo C-II as a cofactor to function in hydrolyzing TGs. LPL is mainly produced in skeletal muscle, fat tissue, and heart muscle. Hydrolysis and removal of TG from CM and VLDL normally protects against excessive postprandial rise in CM mass and TG. As used herein, “Lipoprotein lipase deficient”, “lipoprotein lipase deficiency”, “LPL deficiency” or “LPLD” is also known as “Fredrickson's Type I dyslipidemia”, “chylomicronemia”, “Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome” or “FCS”. Although subjects with LPLD generally lack LPL or LPL activity necessary for effective breakdown of fatty acids such as TGs, these subjects may still have a minimal LPL activity or express a minimal level of LPL. In some instances, a LPLD subject may express LPL or have LPL activity up to about, or no more than, 20%, 19%, 18%, 17%, 16%, 15%, 14%, 13%, 12%, 11%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2% or 1% activity. In other instances, the LPLD subject has no measurable LPL or LPL activity. One embodiment of LPLD encompasses subjects with “hyperlipoproteinemia type Ia” (also known as “Fredrickson's Type Ia”) and refers to the inability of the subjects to produce sufficient functional lipoprotein lipase enzymes necessary for effective breakdown of fatty acids such as TGs. The inability to breakdown TGs leads to hypertriglyceridemia in the subject and, often more than 12 hours after meals, hyperTG and chylomicronemia are still present and visible as lipemia. Type Ia is commonly caused by one or more mutations in the LPL gene. As disclosed herein, LPLD also encompasses subjects that have dysfunctional lipoprotein lipase such as those subjects with “hyperlipoproteinemia type Ib” (also known as “Fredrickson's Type Ib”) and “hyperlipoproteinemia type Ic” (also known as “Fredrickson's Type Ic”). Type Ib is caused by lack of lipoprotein lipase activator apoprotein C-II. Type Ic is due to a circulating inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase. As with Type 1a, Type 1b/1c subjects suffer from an inability to breakdown TGs leading to hypertriglyceridemia and hyperTG and chylomicronemia are still present and visible as lipemia often more than 12 hours after meals. In certain embodiments, LPLD is associated with at least one mutation in the LPL gene such as P207L, G188L or D9N or other mutations that affect LPL (Brunzell, In: Pagon R A, Adam M P, Bird T D, Dolan C R, Fong C T, Stephens K, editors.

Nos. 12/129,154, 60/989,574, 61/026,995, 61/026,998, 61/056,564, 61/086,231, 61/097,787, and 61/099,844; and PCT International Applications Nos. PCT/US2008/064591, PCT/US2008/066154, and PCT/US2008/068922. In certain embodiments, bicyclic sugar moieties and nucleosides incorporating such bicyclic sugar moieties are further defined by isomeric configuration. For example, a nucleoside comprising a 4′-2′ methylene-oxy bridge, may be in the α-L configuration or in the β-D configuration. Previously, α-L-methyleneoxy (4′-CH2—O-2′) bicyclic nucleosides have been incorporated into antisense oligonucleotides that showed antisense activity (Frieden et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2003, 21, 6365-6372). In certain embodiments, substituted sugar moieties comprise one or more non-bridging sugar substituent and one or more bridging sugar substituent (e.g., 5′-substituted and 4′-2′ bridged sugars). (see, PCT International Application WO 2007/134181, published on Nov. 22, 2007, wherein LNA is substituted with, for example, a 5′-methyl or a 5′-vinyl group). In certain embodiments, modified sugar moieties are sugar surrogates. In certain such embodiments, the oxygen atom of the naturally occurring sugar is substituted, e.g., with a sulfur, carbon or nitrogen atom. In certain such embodiments, such modified sugar moiety also comprises bridging and/or non-bridging substituents as described above. For example, certain sugar surrogates comprise a 4′-sulfur atom and a substitution at the 2′-position (see, e.g., published U.S. Patent Application US2005/0130923, published on Jun. 16, 2005) and/or the 5′ position. By way of additional example, carbocyclic bicyclic nucleosides having a 4′-2′ bridge have been described (see, e.g., Freier et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 1997, 25(22), 4429-4443 and Albaek et al., J. Org. Chem., 2006, 71, 7731-7740). In certain embodiments, sugar surrogates comprise rings having other than 5-atoms. For example, in certain embodiments, a sugar surrogate comprises a morpholino. Morpholino compounds and their use in oligomeric compounds has been reported in numerous patents and published articles (see for example: Braasch et al., Biochemistry, 2002, 41, 4503-4510; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,698,685; 5,166,315; 5,185,444; and 5,034,506). As used here, the term “morpholino” means a sugar surrogate having the following structure: In certain embodiments, morpholinos may be modified, for example by adding or altering various substituent groups from the above morpholino structure. Such sugar surrogates are referred to herein as “modified morpholinos.” For another example, in certain embodiments, a sugar surrogate comprises a six-membered tetrahydropyran. Such tetrahydropyrans may be further modified or substituted. Nucleosides comprising such modified tetrahydropyrans include, but are not limited to, hexitol nucleic acid (HNA), anitol nucleic acid (ANA), manitol nucleic acid (MNA) (see Leumann, C J. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. (2002) 10:841-854), fluoro HNA (F-HNA), and those compounds having Formula VI: wherein independently for each of said at least one tetrahydropyran nucleoside analog of Formula VI: Bx is a nucleobase moiety; T3 and T4 are each, independently, an internucleoside linking group linking the tetrahydropyran nucleoside analog to the antisense compound or one of T3 and T4 is an internucleoside linking group linking the tetrahydropyran nucleoside analog to the antisense compound and the other of T3 and T4 is H, a hydroxyl protecting group, a linked conjugate group, or a 5′ or 3′-terminal group; q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 and q7 are each, independently, H, C1-C6 alkyl, substituted C1-C6 alkyl, C2-C6 alkenyl, substituted C2-C6 alkenyl, C2-C6 alkynyl, or substituted C2-C6 alkynyl; and each of R1 and R2 is independently selected from among: hydrogen, halogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, NJ1J2, SJ1, N3, OC(═X)J1, OC(═X)NJ1J2, NJ3C(═X)NJ1J2, and CN, wherein X is O, S or NJ1, and each J1, J2, and J3 is, independently, H or C1-C6 alkyl. In certain embodiments, the modified THP nucleosides of Formula VI are provided wherein q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 and q7 are each H. In certain embodiments, at least one of q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 and q7 is other than H. In certain embodiments, at least one of q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 and q7 is methyl. In certain embodiments, THP nucleosides of Formula VI are provided wherein one of R1 and R2 is F. In certain embodiments, R1 is fluoro and R2 is H, R1 is methoxy and R2 is H, and R1 is methoxyethoxy and R2 is H. Many other bicyclo and tricyclo sugar surrogate ring systems are also known in the art that can be used to modify nucleosides for incorporation into antisense compounds (see, e.g., review article: Leumann, J. C, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 2002, 10, 841-854). Combinations of modifications are also provided without limitation, such as 2′-F-5′-methyl substituted nucleosides (see PCT International Application WO 2008/101157 Published on Aug. 21, 2008 for other disclosed 5′,2′-bis substituted nucleosides) and replacement of the ribosyl ring oxygen atom with S and further substitution at the 2′-position (see published U.S. Patent Application US2005-0130923, published on Jun. 16, 2005) or alternatively 5′-substitution of a bicyclic nucleic acid (see PCT International Application WO 2007/134181, published on Nov. 22, 2007 wherein a 4′-CH2—O-2′ bicyclic nucleoside is further substituted at the 5′ position with a 5′-methyl or a 5′-vinyl group). The synthesis and preparation of carbocyclic bicyclic nucleosides along with their oligomerization and biochemical studies have also been described (see, e.g., Srivastava et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129(26), 8362-8379). In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides oligonucleotides comprising modified nucleosides.

Certain Internucleoside Linkages In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides oligonucleotides comprising linked nucleosides. In such embodiments, nucleosides may be linked together using any internucleoside linkage. The two main classes of internucleoside linking groups are defined by the presence or absence of a phosphorus atom. Representative phosphorus containing internucleoside linkages include, but are not limited to, phosphodiesters (PO), phosphotriesters, methylphosphonates, phosphoramidate, and phosphorothioates (PS). Representative non-phosphorus containing internucleoside linking groups include, but are not limited to, methylenemethylimino (—CH2—N(CH3)—O—CH2—), thiodiester (—O—C(O)—S—), thionocarbamate (—O—C(O)(NH)—S—); siloxane (—O—Si(H)2—O—); and N,N′-dimethylhydrazine (—CH2—N(CH3)—N(CH3)—). Modified linkages, compared to natural phosphodiester linkages, can be used to alter, typically increase, nuclease resistance of the oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments, internucleoside linkages having a chiral atom can be prepared as a racemic mixture, or as separate enantiomers. Representative chiral linkages include, but are not limited to, alkylphosphonates and phosphorothioates. Methods of preparation of phosphorous-containing and non-phosphorous-containing internucleoside linkages are well known to those skilled in the art. The oligonucleotides described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric configurations that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R) or (S), α or β such as for sugar anomers, or as (D) or (L) such as for amino acids etc. Included in the antisense compounds provided herein are all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. Neutral internucleoside linkages include without limitation, phosphotriesters, methylphosphonates, MMI (3′-CH2—N(CH3)—O-5′), amide-3 (3′-CH2—C(═O)—N(H)-5′), amide-4 (3′-CH2—N(H)—C(═O)-5′), formacetal (3′-O—CH2—O-5′), and thioformacetal (3′-S—CH2—O-5′). Further neutral internucleoside linkages include nonionic linkages comprising siloxane (dialkylsiloxane), carboxylate ester, carboxamide, sulfide, sulfonate ester and amides (See for example: Carbohydrate Modifications in Antisense Research; Y. S. Sanghvi and P. D. Cook, Eds., ACS Symposium Series 580; Chapters 3 and 4, 40-65). Further neutral internucleoside linkages include nonionic linkages comprising mixed N, O, S and CH2 component parts. 4.

Specifically, at least the sugar moieties of the nucleosides of each wing that are closest to the gap (the 3′-most nucleoside of the 5′-wing and the 5′-most nucleoside of the 3′-wing) differ from the sugar moiety of the neighboring gap nucleosides, thus defining the boundary between the wings and the gap. In certain embodiments, the sugar moieties within the gap are the same as one another. In certain embodiments, the gap includes one or more nucleoside having a sugar moiety that differs from the sugar moiety of one or more other nucleosides of the gap.

For example, an oligonucleotide comprising 8-30 nucleosides excludes oligonucleotides having 31 nucleosides, but, unless otherwise indicated, such an oligonucleotide may further comprise, for example one or more conjugate groups, terminal groups, or other substituents. Further, where an oligonucleotide is described by an overall length range and by regions having specified lengths, and where the sum of specified lengths of the regions is less than the upper limit of the overall length range, the oligonucleotide may have additional nucleosides, beyond those of the specified regions, provided that the total number of nucleosides does not exceed the upper limit of the overall length range. 5. Certain Antisense Oligonucleotide Chemistry Motifs In certain embodiments, the chemical structural features of antisense oligonucleotides are characterized by their sugar motif, internucleoside linkage motif, nucleobase modification motif and overall length. In certain embodiments, such parameters are each independent of one another. Thus, each internucleoside linkage of an oligonucleotide having a gapmer sugar motif may be modified or unmodified and may or may not follow the gapmer modification pattern of the sugar modifications. Thus, the internucleoside linkages within the wing regions of a sugar-gapmer may be the same or different from one another and may be the same or different from the internucleoside linkages of the gap region. Likewise, such sugar-gapmer oligonucleotides may comprise one or more modified nucleobase independent of the gapmer pattern of the sugar modifications. One of skill in the art will appreciate that such motifs may be combined to create a variety of oligonucleotides. In certain embodiments, the selection of internucleoside linkage and nucleoside modification are not independent of one another. i. Certain Sequences and Targets In certain embodiments, the invention provides antisense oligonucleotides having a sequence complementary to a target nucleic acid. Such antisense compounds are capable of hybridizing to a target nucleic acid, resulting in at least one antisense activity. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds specifically hybridize to one or more target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, a specifically hybridizing antisense compound has a nucleobase sequence comprising a region having sufficient complementarity to a target nucleic acid to allow hybridization and result in antisense activity and insufficient complementarity to any non-target so as to avoid or reduce non-specific hybridization to non-target nucleic acid sequences under conditions in which specific hybridization is desired (e.g., under physiological conditions for in vivo or therapeutic uses, and under conditions in which assays are performed in the case of in vitro assays). In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are selective between a target and non-target, even though both target and non-target comprise the target sequence. In such embodiments, selectivity may result from relative accessibility of the target region of one nucleic acid molecule compared to the other. In certain embodiments, the present disclosure provides antisense compounds comprising oligonucleotides that are fully complementary to the target nucleic acid over the entire length of the oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are 99% complementary to the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are 95% complementary to the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, such oligonucleotides are 90% complementary to the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, such oligonucleotides are 85% complementary to the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, such oligonucleotides are 80% complementary to the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, an antisense compound comprises a region that is fully complementary to a target nucleic acid and is at least 80% complementary to the target nucleic acid over the entire length of the oligonucleotide. In certain such embodiments, the region of full complementarity is from 6 to 14 nucleobases in length. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides comprise a hybridizing region and a terminal region. In certain such embodiments, the hybridizing region consists of 12-30 linked nucleosides and is fully complementary to the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, the hybridizing region includes one mismatch relative to the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, the hybridizing region includes two mismatches relative to the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, the hybridizing region includes three mismatches relative to the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, the terminal region consists of 1-4 terminal nucleosides. In certain embodiments, the terminal nucleosides are at the 3′ end. In certain embodiments, one or more of the terminal nucleosides are not complementary to the target nucleic acid. Antisense mechanisms include any mechanism involving the hybridization of an oligonucleotide with target nucleic acid, wherein the hybridization results in a biological effect. In certain embodiments, such hybridization results in either target nucleic acid degradation or occupancy with concomitant inhibition or stimulation of the cellular machinery involving, for example, translation, transcription, or splicing of the target nucleic acid. One type of antisense mechanism involving degradation of target RNA is RNase H mediated antisense. RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. It is known in the art that single-stranded antisense compounds which are “DNA-like” elicit RNase H activity in mammalian cells. Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of DNA-like oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of gene expression.

C. Certain Uses and Features In certain embodiments, conjugated antisense compounds exhibit potent target RNA reduction in vivo. In certain embodiments, unconjugated antisense compounds accumulate in the kidney. In certain embodiments, conjugated antisense compounds accumulate in the liver. In certain embodiments, conjugated antisense compounds are well tolerated. Such properties render conjugated antisense compounds particularly useful for inhibition of many target RNAs, including, but not limited to those involved in metabolic, cardiovascular and other diseases, disorders or conditions. Thus, provided herein are methods of treating such diseases, disorders or conditions by contacting liver tissues with the conjugated antisense compounds targeted to RNAs associated with such diseases, disorders or conditions. Thus, also provided are methods for ameliorating any of a variety of metabolic, cardiovascular and other diseases, disorders or conditions with the conjugated antisense compounds of the present invention. In certain embodiments, conjugated antisense compounds are more potent than unconjugated counterpart at a particular tissue concentration. Without wishing to be bound by any theory or mechanism, in certain embodiments, the conjugate may allow the conjugated antisense compound to enter the cell more efficiently or to enter the cell more productively. For example, in certain embodiments conjugated antisense compounds may exhibit greater target reduction as compared to its unconjugated counterpart wherein both the conjugated antisense compound and its unconjugated counterpart are present in the tissue at the same concentrations. For example, in certain embodiments conjugated antisense compounds may exhibit greater target reduction as compared to its unconjugated counterpart wherein both the conjugated antisense compound and its unconjugated counterpart are present in the liver at the same concentrations. Productive and non-productive uptake of oligonucleotides has been discussed previously (See e.g. Geary, R. S., E. Wancewicz, et al. (2009). “Effect of Dose and Plasma Concentration on Liver Uptake and Pharmacologic Activity of a 2′-Methoxyethyl Modified Chimeric Antisense Oligonucleotide Targeting PTEN.” Biochem. Pharmacol. 78(3): 284-91; & Koller, E., T. M. Vincent, et al. (2011). “Mechanisms of single-stranded phosphorothioate modified antisense oligonucleotide accumulation in hepatocytes.” Nucleic Acids Res. 39(11): 4795-807). Conjugate groups described herein may improve productive uptake. In certain embodiments, the conjugate groups described herein may further improve potency by increasing the affinity of the conjugated antisense compound for a particular type of cell or tissue. In certain embodiments, the conjugate groups described herein may further improve potency by increasing recognition of the conjugated antisense compound by one or more cell-surface receptors. In certain embodiments, the conjugate groups described herein may further improve potency by facilitating endocytosis of the conjugated antisense compound. In certain embodiments, the cleavable moiety may further improve potency by allowing the conjugate to be cleaved from the antisense oligonucleotide after the conjugated antisense compound has entered the cell. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, conjugated antisense compounds can be administered at doses lower than would be necessary for unconjugated antisense oligonucleotides. Phosphorothioate linkages have been incorporated into antisense oligonucleotides previously. Such phosphorothioate linkages are resistant to nucleases and so improve stability of the oligonucleotide. Further, phosphorothioate linkages also bind certain proteins, which results in accumulation of antisense oligonucleotide in the liver. Oligonucleotides with fewer phosphorothioate linkages accumulate less in the liver and more in the kidney (see, for example, Geary, R., “Pharmacokinetic Properties of 2′-O-(2-Methoxyethyl)-Modified Oligonucleotide Analogs in Rats,” Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Vol. 296, No. 3, 890-897; & Pharmacological Properties of 2′-O-Methoxyethyl Modified Oligonucleotides in Antisense a Drug Technology, Chapter 10, Crooke, S. T., ed., 2008) In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides with fewer phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages and more phosphodiester internucleoside linkages accumulate less in the liver and more in the kidney. When treating diseases in the liver, this is undesirable for several reasons (1) less drug is getting to the site of desired action (liver); (2) drug is escaping into the urine; and (3) the kidney is exposed to relatively high concentration of drug which can result in toxicities in the kidney. Thus, for liver diseases, phosphorothioate linkages provide important benefits. In certain embodiments, however, administration of oligonucleotides uniformly linked by phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages induces one or more proinflammatory reactions. (see for example: J Lab Clin Med. 1996 September; 128(3):329-38. “Amplification of antibody production by phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides”. Branda et al.; and see also for example: Toxicologic Properties in Antisense a Drug Technology, Chapter 12, pages 342-351, Crooke, S. T., ed., 2008). In certain embodiments, administration of oligonucleotides wherein most of the internucleoside linkages comprise phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages induces one or more proinflammatory reactions. In certain embodiments, the degree of proinflammatory effect may depend on several variables (e.g. backbone modification, off-target effects, nucleobase modifications, and/or nucleoside modifications) see for example: Toxicologic Properties in Antisense a Drug Technology, Chapter 12, pages 342-351, Crooke, S. T., ed., 2008). In certain embodiments, the degree of proinflammatory effect may be mitigated by adjusting one or more variables. For example the degree of proinflammatory effect of a given oligonucleotide may be mitigated by replacing any number of phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages with phosphodiester internucleoside linkages and thereby reducing the total number of phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, it would be desirable to reduce the number of phosphorothioate linkages, if doing so could be done without losing stability and without shifting the distribution from liver to kidney. For example, in certain embodiments, the number of phosphorothioate linkages may be reduced by replacing phosphorothioate linkages with phosphodiester linkages. In such an embodiment, the antisense compound having fewer phosphorothioate linkages and more phosphodiester linkages may induce less proinflammatory reactions or no proinflammatory reaction. Although the antisense compound having fewer phosphorothioate linkages and more phosphodiester linkages may induce fewer proinflammatory reactions, the antisense compound having fewer phosphorothioate linkages and more phosphodiester linkages may not accumulate in the liver and may be less efficacious at the same or similar dose as compared to an antisense compound having more phosphorothioate linkages. In certain embodiments, it is therefore desirable to design an antisense compound that has a plurality of phosphodiester bonds and a plurality of phosphorothioate bonds but which also possesses stability and good distribution to the liver. In certain embodiments, conjugated antisense compounds accumulate more in the liver and less in the kidney than unconjugated counterparts, even when some of the phosphorothioate linkages are replaced with less proinflammatory phosphodiester internucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, conjugated antisense compounds accumulate more in the liver and are not excreted as much in the urine compared to its unconjugated counterparts, even when some of the phosphorothioate linkages are replaced with less proinflammatory phosphodiester internucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, the use of a conjugate allows one to design more potent and better tolerated antisense drugs. Indeed, in certain embodiments, conjugated antisense compounds have larger therapeutic indexes than unconjugated counterparts. This allows the conjugated antisense compound to be administered at a higher absolute dose, because there is less risk of proinflammatory response and less risk of kidney toxicity. This higher dose, allows one to dose less frequently, since the clearance (metabolism) is expected to be similar. Further, because the compound is more potent, as described above, one can allow the concentration to go lower before the next dose without losing therapeutic activity, allowing for even longer periods between dosing. In certain embodiments, the inclusion of some phosphorothioate linkages remains desirable. For example, the terminal linkages are vulnerable to exonucleases and so in certain embodiments, those linkages are phosphorothioate or other modified linkage. Internucleoside linkages linking two deoxynucleosides are vulnerable to endonucleases and so in certain embodiments those linkages are phosphorothioate or other modified linkage. Internucleoside linkages between a modified nucleoside and a deoxynucleoside where the deoxynucleoside is on the 5′ side of the linkage deoxynucleosides are vulnerable to endonucleases and so in certain embodiments those linkages are phosphorothioate or other modified linkage. Internucleoside linkages between two modified nucleosides of certain types and between a deoxynucleoside and a modified nucleoside of certain type where the modified nucleoside is at the 5′ side of the linkage are sufficiently resistant to nuclease digestion, that the linkage can be phosphodiester. In certain embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide of a conjugated antisense compound comprises fewer than 16 phosphorthioate linkages. In certain embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide of a conjugated antisense compound comprises fewer than 15 phosphorthioate linkages. In certain embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide of a conjugated antisense compound comprises fewer than 14 phosphorthioate linkages. In certain embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide of a conjugated antisense compound comprises fewer than 13 phosphorthioate linkages. In certain embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide of a conjugated antisense compound comprises fewer than 12 phosphorthioate linkages. In certain embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide of a conjugated antisense compound comprises fewer than 11 phosphorthioate linkages. In certain embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide of a conjugated antisense compound comprises fewer than 10 phosphorthioate linkages. In certain embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide of a conjugated antisense compound comprises fewer than 9 phosphorthioate linkages. In certain embodiments, the antisense oligonucleotide of a conjugated antisense compound comprises fewer than 8 phosphorthioate linkages. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds comprising one or more conjugate group described herein has increased activity and/or potency and/or tolerability compared to a parent antisense compound lacking such one or more conjugate group. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, attachment of such conjugate groups to an oligonucleotide is desirable. Such conjugate groups may be attached at the 5′-, and/or 3′-end of an oligonucleotide. In certain instances, attachment at the 5′-end is synthetically desirable. Typically, oligonucleotides are synthesized by attachment of the 3′ terminal nucleoside to a solid support and sequential coupling of nucleosides from 3′ to 5′ using techniques that are well known in the art. Accordingly if a conjugate group is desired at the 3′-terminus, one may (1) attach the conjugate group to the 3′-terminal nucleoside and attach that conjugated nucleoside to the solid support for subsequent preparation of the oligonucleotide or (2) attach the conjugate group to the 3′-terminal nucleoside of a completed oligonucleotide after synthesis. Neither of these approaches is very efficient and thus both are costly. In particular, attachment of the conjugated nucleoside to the solid support, while demonstrated in the Examples herein, is an inefficient process. In certain embodiments, attaching a conjugate group to the 5′-terminal nucleoside is synthetically easier than attachment at the 3′-end. One may attach a non-conjugated 3′ terminal nucleoside to the solid support and prepare the oligonucleotide using standard and well characterized reactions. One then needs only to attach a 5′ nucleoside having a conjugate group at the final coupling step. In certain embodiments, this is more efficient than attaching a conjugated nucleoside directly to the solid support as is typically done to prepare a 3′-conjugated oligonucleotide. The Examples herein demonstrate attachment at the 5′-end. In addition, certain conjugate groups have synthetic advantages. For Example, certain conjugate groups comprising phosphorus linkage groups are synthetically simpler and more efficiently prepared than other conjugate groups, including conjugate groups reported previously (e.g., WO/2012/037254). In certain embodiments, conjugated antisense compounds are administered to a subject. In such embodiments, antisense compounds comprising one or more conjugate group described herein has increased activity and/or potency and/or tolerability compared to a parent antisense compound lacking such one or more conjugate group. Without being bound by mechanism, it is believed that the conjugate group helps with distribution, delivery, and/or uptake into a target cell or tissue. In certain embodiments, once inside the target cell or tissue, it is desirable that all or part of the conjugate group to be cleaved to release the active oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments, it is not necessary that the entire conjugate group be cleaved from the oligonucleotide. For example, in Example 20 a conjugated oligonucleotide was administered to mice and a number of different chemical species, each comprising a different portion of the conjugate group remaining on the oligonucleotide, were detected (Table 23a). This conjugated antisense compound demonstrated good potency (Table 23). Thus, in certain embodiments, such metabolite profile of multiple partial cleavage of the conjugate group does not interfere with activity/potency. Nevertheless, in certain embodiments it is desirable that a prodrug (conjugated oligonucleotide) yield a single active compound. In certain instances, if multiple forms of the active compound are found, it may be necessary to determine relative amounts and activities for each one. In certain embodiments where regulatory review is required (e.g., USFDA or counterpart) it is desirable to have a single (or predominantly single) active species. In certain such embodiments, it is desirable that such single active species be the antisense oligonucleotide lacking any portion of the conjugate group. In certain embodiments, conjugate groups at the 5′-end are more likely to result in complete metabolism of the conjugate group. Without being bound by mechanism it may be that endogenous enzymes responsible for metabolism at the 5′ end (e.g., 5′ nucleases) are more active/efficient than the 3′ counterparts. In certain embodiments, the specific conjugate groups are more amenable to metabolism to a single active species. In certain embodiments, certain conjugate groups are more amenable to metabolism to the oligonucleotide. D. Antisense In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of the present invention are antisense compounds. In such embodiments, the oligomeric compound is complementary to a target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, a target nucleic acid is an RNA. In certain embodiments, a target nucleic acid is a non-coding RNA. In certain embodiments, a target nucleic acid encodes a protein. In certain embodiments, a target nucleic acid is selected from a mRNA, a pre-mRNA, a microRNA, a non-coding RNA, including small non-coding RNA, and a promoter-directed RNA. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds are at least partially complementary to more than one target nucleic acid. For example, oligomeric compounds of the present invention may be microRNA mimics, which typically bind to multiple targets. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds comprise a portion having a nucleobase sequence at least 70% complementary to the nucleobase sequence of a target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds comprise a portion having a nucleobase sequence at least 80% complementary to the nucleobase sequence of a target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds comprise a portion having a nucleobase sequence at least 90% complementary to the nucleobase sequence of a target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds comprise a portion having a nucleobase sequence at least 95% complementary to the nucleobase sequence of a target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds comprise a portion having a nucleobase sequence at least 98% complementary to the nucleobase sequence of a target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds comprise a portion having a nucleobase sequence that is 100% complementary to the nucleobase sequence of a target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds are at least 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 98%, or 100% complementary to the nucleobase sequence of a target nucleic acid over the entire length of the antisense compound. Antisense mechanisms include any mechanism involving the hybridization of an oligomeric compound with target nucleic acid, wherein the hybridization results in a biological effect. In certain embodiments, such hybridization results in either target nucleic acid degradation or occupancy with concomitant inhibition or stimulation of the cellular machinery involving, for example, translation, transcription, or polyadenylation of the target nucleic acid or of a nucleic acid with which the target nucleic acid may otherwise interact. One type of antisense mechanism involving degradation of target RNA is RNase H mediated antisense. RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. It is known in the art that single-stranded antisense compounds which are “DNA-like” elicit RNase H activity in mammalian cells. Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of DNA-like oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of gene expression. Antisense mechanisms also include, without limitation RNAi mechanisms, which utilize the RISC pathway. Such RNAi mechanisms include, without limitation siRNA, ssRNA and microRNA mechanisms. Such mechanisms include creation of a microRNA mimic and/or an anti-microRNA. Antisense mechanisms also include, without limitation, mechanisms that hybridize or mimic non-coding RNA other than microRNA or mRNA. Such non-coding RNA includes, but is not limited to promoter-directed RNA and short and long RNA that effects transcription or translation of one or more nucleic acids. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides comprising conjugates described herein are RNAi compounds. In certain embodiments, oligomeric oligonucleotides comprising conjugates described herein are ssRNA compounds. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides comprising conjugates described herein are paired with a second oligomeric compound to form an siRNA. In certain such embodiments, the second oligomeric compound also comprises a conjugate. In certain embodiments, the second oligomeric compound is any modified or unmodified nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotides comprising conjugates described herein is the antisense strand in an siRNA compound. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotides comprising conjugates described herein is the sense strand in an siRNA compound. In embodiments in which the conjugated oligomeric compound is double-stranded siRnA, the conjugate may be on the sense strand, the antisense strand or both the sense strand and the antisense strand. D. Apolipoprotein C-III (apoCIII) In certain embodiments, conjugated antisense compounds target any ApoCIII nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, the target nucleic acid encodes an ApoCIII target protein that is clinically relevant. In such embodiments, modulation of the target nucleic acid results in clinical benefit. The targeting process usually includes determination of at least one target region, segment, or site within the target nucleic acid for the antisense interaction to occur such that the desired effect will result. In certain embodiments, a target region is a structurally defined region of the nucleic acid. For example, in certain such embodiments, a target region may encompass a 3′ UTR, a 5′ UTR, an exon, an intron, a coding region, a translation initiation region, translation termination region, or other defined nucleic acid region or target segment. In certain embodiments, a target segment is at least about an 8-nucleobase portion of a target region to which a conjugated antisense compound is targeted. Target segments can include DNA or RNA sequences that comprise at least 8 consecutive nucleobases from the 5′-terminus of one of the target segments (the remaining nucleobases being a consecutive stretch of the same DNA or RNA beginning immediately upstream of the 5′-terminus of the target segment and continuing until the DNA or RNA comprises about 8 to about 30 nucleobases). Target segments are also represented by DNA or RNA sequences that comprise at least 8 consecutive nucleobases from the 3′-terminus of one of the target segments (the remaining nucleobases being a consecutive stretch of the same DNA or RNA beginning immediately downstream of the 3′-terminus of the target segment and continuing until the DNA or RNA comprises about 8 to about 30 nucleobases). Target segments can also be represented by DNA or RNA sequences that comprise at least 8 consecutive nucleobases from an internal portion of the sequence of a target segment, and may extend in either or both directions until the conjugated antisense compound comprises about 8 to about 30 nucleobases. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to an ApoCIII nucleic acid can be modified as described herein. In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds can have a modified sugar moiety, an unmodified sugar moiety or a mixture of modified and unmodified sugar moieties as described herein. In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds can have a modified internucleoside linkage, an unmodified internucleoside linkage or a mixture of modified and unmodified internucleoside linkages as described herein. In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds can have a modified nucleobase, an unmodified nucleobase or a mixture of modified and unmodified nucleobases as described herein. In certain embodiments, the antisense compounds can have a motif as described herein. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds targeted to ApoCIII nucleic acids can be conjugated as described herein. ApoCIII is a constituent of HDL and of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins. Elevated ApoCIII levels are associated with elevated TG levels and diseases such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity and diabetes. Elevated TG levels are associated with pancreatitis. ApoCIII slows clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins by inhibiting lipolysis through inhibition of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and through interfering with lipoprotein binding to cell-surface glycosaminoglycan matrix. Antisense compounds targeting ApoCIII have been previously disclosed in WO2004/093783 and WO2012/149495, each herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In certain embodiments, certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide are used. In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition provided herein comprises one or more tissue-specific delivery molecules designed to deliver the one or more pharmaceutical agents of the present disclosure to specific tissues or cell types. For example, in certain embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions include liposomes coated with a tissue-specific antibody. In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition provided herein comprises a co-solvent system. Certain of such co-solvent systems comprise, for example, benzyl alcohol, a nonpolar surfactant, a water-miscible organic polymer, and an aqueous phase. In certain embodiments, such co-solvent systems are used for hydrophobic compounds. A non-limiting example of such a co-solvent system is the VPD co-solvent system, which is a solution of absolute ethanol comprising 3% w/v benzyl alcohol, 8% w/v of the nonpolar surfactant Polysorbate 80™ and 65% w/v polyethylene glycol 300. The proportions of such co-solvent systems may be varied considerably without significantly altering their solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of co-solvent components may be varied: for example, other surfactants may be used instead of Polysorbate 80™; the fraction size of polyethylene glycol may be varied; other biocompatible polymers may replace polyethylene glycol, e.g., polyvinyl pyrrolidone; and other sugars or polysaccharides may substitute for dextrose.

Certain solvents suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions for injection include, but are not limited to, lipophilic solvents and fatty oils, such as sesame oil, synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, and liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, such suspensions may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the solubility of the pharmaceutical agents to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition is prepared for transmucosal administration. In certain of such embodiments penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.

Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art. In certain embodiments, one or more modified oligonucleotide provided herein is formulated as a prodrug. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically more active form of an oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments, prodrugs are useful because they are easier to administer than the corresponding active form. For example, in certain instances, a prodrug may be more bioavailable (e.g., through oral administration) than is the corresponding active form.

In certain embodiments, pharmaceutical intrathecals are administered to achieve local rather than systemic exposures. For example, pharmaceutical compositions may be injected directly in the area of desired effect (e.g., into the liver). NONLIMITING DISCLOSURE AND INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE While certain compounds, compositions and methods described herein have been described with specificity in accordance with certain embodiments, the following examples serve only to illustrate the compounds described herein and are not intended to limit the same. Each of the references, GenBank accession numbers, and the like recited in the present application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Although the sequence listing accompanying this filing identifies each sequence as either “RNA” or “DNA” as required, in reality, those sequences may be modified with any combination of chemical modifications. One of skill in the art will readily appreciate that such designation as “RNA” or “DNA” to describe modified oligonucleotides is, in certain instances, arbitrary. For example, an oligonucleotide comprising a nucleoside comprising a 2′-OH sugar moiety and a thymine base could be described as a DNA having a modified sugar (2′-OH for the natural 2′-H of DNA) or as an RNA having a modified base (thymine (methylated uracil) for natural uracil of RNA). Accordingly, nucleic acid sequences provided herein, including, but not limited to those in the sequence listing, are intended to encompass nucleic acids containing any combination of natural or modified RNA and/or DNA, including, but not limited to such nucleic acids having modified nucleobases. By way of further example and without limitation, an oligonucleotide having the nucleobase sequence “ATCGATCG” encompasses any oligonucleotides having such nucleobase sequence, whether modified or unmodified, including, but not limited to, such compounds comprising RNA bases, such as those having sequence “AUCGAUCG” and those having some DNA bases and some RNA bases such as “AUCGATCG” and oligonucleotides having other modified bases, such as “ATmeCGAUCG,” wherein meC indicates a cytosine base comprising a methyl group at the 5-position. EXAMPLES The following examples illustrate certain embodiments of the present disclosure and are not limiting. Moreover, where specific embodiments are provided, the inventors have contemplated generic application of those specific embodiments. For example, disclosure of an oligonucleotide having a particular motif provides reasonable support for additional oligonucleotides having the same or similar motif And, for example, where a particular high-affinity modification appears at a particular position, other high-affinity modifications at the same position are considered suitable, unless otherwise indicated.

Example 19 General Method for the Preparation of Conjugated ASOs Comprising GalNAc3-1 at the 3′ Position Via Solid Phase Techniques (Preparation of ISIS 647535, 647536 and 651900) Unless otherwise stated, all reagents and solutions used for the synthesis of oligomeric compounds are purchased from commercial sources. Standard phosphoramidite building blocks and solid support are used for incorporation nucleoside residues which include for example T, A, G, and mC residues. A 0.1 M solution of phosphoramidite in anhydrous acetonitrile was used for β-D-2′-deoxyribonucleoside and 2′-MOE. The ASO syntheses were performed on ABI 394 synthesizer (1-2 μmol scale) or on GE Healthcare Bioscience ÄKTA oligopilot synthesizer (40-200 μmol scale) by the phosphoramidite coupling method on an GalNAc3-1 loaded VIMAD solid support (110 μmol/g, Guzaev et al., 2003) packed in the column. For the coupling step, the phosphoramidites were delivered 4 fold excess over the loading on the solid support and phosphoramidite condensation was carried out for 10 min. All other steps followed standard protocols supplied by the manufacturer. A solution of 6% dichloroacetic acid in toluene was used for removing dimethoxytrityl (DMT) group from 5′-hydroxyl group of the nucleotide. 4,5-Dicyanoimidazole (0.7 M) in anhydrous CH3CN was used as activator during coupling step. Phosphorothioate linkages were introduced by sulfurization with 0.1 M solution of xanthane hydride in 1:1 pyridine/CH3CN for a contact time of 3 minutes. A solution of 20% tert-butylhydroperoxide in CH3CN containing 6% water was used as an oxidizing agent to provide phosphodiester internucleoside linkages with a contact time of 12 minutes. After the desired sequence was assembled, the cyanoethyl phosphate protecting groups were deprotected using a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of triethylamine and acetonitrile with a contact time of 45 minutes. The solid-support bound ASOs were suspended in aqueous ammonia (28-30 wt %) and heated at 55° C. for 6 h. The unbound ASOs were then filtered and the ammonia was boiled off. The residue was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a strong anion exchange column (GE Healthcare Bioscience, Source 30Q, 30 μm, 2.54×8 cm, A=100 mM ammonium acetate in 30% aqueous CH3CN, B=1.5 M NaBr in A, 0-40% of B in 60 min, flow 14 mL min-1, λ=260 nm). The residue was desalted by HPLC on a reverse phase column to yield the desired ASOs in an isolated yield of 15-30% based on the initial loading on the solid support. The ASOs were characterized by ion-pair-HPLC coupled MS analysis with Agilent 1100 MSD system. Antisense oligonucleotides not comprising a conjugate were synthesized using standard oligonucleotide synthesis procedures well known in the art. Using these methods, three separate antisense compounds targeting ApoC III were prepared. As summarized in Table 17, below, each of the three antisense compounds targeting ApoC III had the same nucleobase sequence; ISIS 304801 is a 5-10-5 MOE gapmer having all phosphorothioate linkages; ISIS 647535 is the same as ISIS 304801, except that it had a GalNAc3-1 conjugated at its 3′ end; and ISIS 647536 is the same as ISIS 647535 except that certain internucleoside linkages of that compound are phosphodiester linkages. As further summarized in Table 17, two separate antisense compounds targeting SRB-1 were synthesized. ISIS 440762 was a 2-10-2 cEt gapmer with all phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages; ISIS 651900 is the same as ISIS 440762, except that it included a GalNAc3-1 at its 3′-end.

Note that GalNAc3-1 comprises a cleavable adenosine which links the ASO to remainder of the conjugate, which is designated “GalNAc3-1.” This nomenclature is used in the above table to show the full nucleobase sequence, including the adenosine, which is part of the conjugate. Thus, in the above table, the sequences could also be listed as ending with “GalNAc3-1” with the “Ado” omitted. This convention of using the subscript “a” to indicate the portion of a conjugate group lacking a cleavable nucleoside or cleavable moiety is used throughout these Examples. This portion of a conjugate group lacking the cleavable moiety is referred to herein as a “cluster” or “conjugate cluster” or “GalNAc3 cluster.” In certain instances it is convenient to describe a conjugate group by separately providing its cluster and its cleavable moiety. Example 20 Dose-Dependent Antisense Inhibition of Human ApoC III in huApoC III Transgenic Mice ISIS 304801 and ISIS 647535, each targeting human ApoC III and described above, were separately tested and evaluated in a dose-dependent study for their ability to inhibit human ApoC III in human ApoC III transgenic mice. Treatment Human ApoCIII transgenic mice were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum Teklad lab chow. Animals were acclimated for at least 7 days in the research facility before initiation of the experiment. ASOs were prepared in PBS and sterilized by filtering through a 0.2 micron filter. ASOs were dissolved in 0.9% PBS for injection. Human ApoC III transgenic mice were injected intraperitoneally once a week for two weeks with ISIS 304801 or 647535 at 0.08, 0.25. 0.75, 2.25 or 6.75 μmol/kg or with PBS as a control. Each treatment group consisted of 4 animals. Forty-eight hours after the administration of the last dose, blood was drawn from each mouse and the mice were sacrificed and tissues were collected. ApoC III mRNA Analysis ApoC III mRNA levels in the mice's livers were determined using real-time PCR and RIBOGREEN® RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, Oreg.) according to standard protocols. ApoC III mRNA levels were determined relative to total RNA (using Ribogreen), prior to normalization to PBS-treated control. The results below are presented as the average percent of ApoC III mRNA levels for each treatment group, normalized to PBS-treated control and are denoted as “% PBS”. The half maximal effective dosage (ED50) of each ASO is also presented in Table 18, below. As illustrated, both antisense compounds reduced ApoC III RNA relative to the PBS control. Further, the antisense compound conjugated to GalNAc3-1 (ISIS 647535) was substantially more potent than the antisense compound lacking the GalNAc3-1 conjugate (ISIS 304801).

Approximately 100 μl of plasma isolated from mice was analyzed without dilution using an Olympus Clinical Analyzer and a commercially available turbidometric ApoC III assay (Kamiya, Cat#KAI-006, Kamiya Biomedical, Seattle, Wash.). The assay protocol was performed as described by the vendor. As shown in the Table 19 below, both antisense compounds reduced ApoC III protein relative to the PBS control. Further, the antisense compound conjugated to GalNAc3-1 (ISIS 647535) was substantially more potent than the antisense compound lacking the GalNAc3-1 conjugate (ISIS 304801).

The triglyceride levels were measured relative to PBS injected mice and are denoted as “% PBS”. Results are presented in Table 20. As illustrated, both antisense compounds lowered triglyceride levels. Further, the antisense compound conjugated to GalNAc3-1 (ISIS 647535) was substantially more potent than the antisense compound lacking the GalNAc3-1 conjugate (ISIS 304801).

Results are presented in Tables 21 and 22. As illustrated, both antisense compounds lowered total cholesterol levels; both lowered LDL; and both raised HDL. Further, the antisense compound conjugated to GalNAc3-1 (ISIS 647535) was substantially more potent than the antisense compound lacking the GalNAc3-1 conjugate (ISIS 304801). An increase in HDL and a decrease in LDL levels is a cardiovascular beneficial effect of antisense inhibition of ApoC III.

Liver and kidney samples were minced and extracted using standard protocols. Samples were analyzed on MSD1 utilizing IP-HPLC-MS. The tissue level (μg/g) of full-length ISIS 304801 and 647535 was measured and the results are provided in Table 23. As illustrated, liver concentrations of total full-length antisense compounds were similar for the two antisense compounds. Thus, even though the GalNAc3-1-conjugated antisense compound is more active in the liver (as demonstrated by the RNA and protein data above), it is not present at substantially higher concentration in the liver. Indeed, the calculated EC50 (provided in Table 23) confirms that the observed increase in potency of the conjugated compound cannot be entirely attributed to increased accumulation. This result suggests that the conjugate improved potency by a mechanism other than liver accumulation alone, possibly by improving the productive uptake of the antisense compound into cells. The results also show that the concentration of GalNAc3-1 conjugated antisense compound in the kidney is lower than that of antisense compound lacking the GalNAc conjugate. This has several beneficial therapeutic implications. For therapeutic indications where activity in the kidney is not sought, exposure to kidney risks kidney toxicity without corresponding benefit. Moreover, high concentration in kidney typically results in loss of compound to the urine resulting in faster clearance. Accordingly, for non-kidney targets, kidney accumulation is undesired. These data suggest that GalNAc3-1 conjugation reduces kidney accumulation.

The cleavage sites and structures of the observed metabolites are shown below. The relative % of full length ASO was calculated using standard procedures and the results are presented in Table 23a. The major metabolite of ISIS 647535 was full-length ASO lacking the entire conjugate (i.e. ISIS 304801), which results from cleavage at cleavage site A, shown below. Further, additional metabolites resulting from other cleavage sites were also observed. These results suggest that introducing other cleavable bonds such as esters, peptides, disulfides, phosphoramidates or acyl-hydrazones between the GalNAc3-1 sugar and the ASO, which can be cleaved by enzymes inside the cell, or which may cleave in the reductive environment of the cytosol, or which are labile to the acidic pH inside endosomes and lyzosomes, can also be useful.

Treatment Human ApoCIII transgenic mice were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum Teklad lab chow. Animals were acclimated for at least 7 days in the research facility before initiation of the experiment. ASOs were prepared in PBS and sterilized by filtering through a 0.2 micron filter. ASOs were dissolved in 0.9% PBS for injection. Human ApoC III transgenic mice were injected intraperitoneally once at the dosage shown below with ISIS 304801, 647535 or 647536 (described above) or with PBS treated control. The treatment group consisted of 3 animals and the control group consisted of 4 animals. Prior to the treatment as well as after the last dose, blood was drawn from each mouse and plasma samples were analyzed. The mice were sacrificed 72 hours following the last administration. Samples were collected and analyzed to determine the ApoC III mRNA and protein levels in the liver; plasma triglycerides; and cholesterol, including HDL and LDL fractions were assessed as described above (Example 20). Data from those analyses are presented in Tables 24-28, below. Liver transaminase levels, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), in serum were measured relative to saline injected mice using standard protocols. The ALT and AST levels showed that the antisense compounds were well tolerated at all administered doses. These results show improvement in potency for antisense compounds comprising a GalNAc3-1 conjugate at the 3′ terminus (ISIS 647535 and 647536) compared to the antisense compound lacking a GalNAc3-1 conjugate (ISIS 304801). Further, ISIS 647536, which comprises a GalNAc3-1 conjugate and some phosphodiester linkages was as potent as ISIS 647535, which comprises the same conjugate and all internucleoside linkages within the ASO are phosphorothioate.

The results also show equal potency of a GalNAc3-1 conjugated antisense compounds where the antisense oligonucleotides have mixed linkages (ISIS 647536 which has six phosphodiester linkages) and a full phosphorothioate version of the same antisense compound (ISIS 647535). Phosphorothioate linkages provide several properties to antisense compounds. For example, they resist nuclease digestion and they bind proteins resulting in accumulation of compound in the liver, rather than in the kidney/urine. These are desirable properties, particularly when treating an indication in the liver. However, phosphorothioate linkages have also been associated with an inflammatory response. Accordingly, reducing the number of phosphorothioate linkages in a compound is expected to reduce the risk of inflammation, but also lower concentration of the compound in liver, increase concentration in the kidney and urine, decrease stability in the presence of nucleases, and lower overall potency. The present results show that a GalNAc3-1 conjugated antisense compound where certain phosphorothioate linkages have been replaced with phosphodiester linkages is as potent against a target in the liver as a counterpart having full phosphorothioate linkages. Such compounds are expected to be less proinflammatory (See Example 24 describing an experiment showing reduction of PS results in reduced inflammatory effect). Example 22 Effect of GalNAc3-1 Conjugated Modified ASO Targeting SRB-1 In Vivo ISIS 440762 and 651900, each targeting SRB-1 and described in Table 17, were evaluated in a dose-dependent study for their ability to inhibit SRB-1 in Balb/c mice. Treatment Six week old male Balb/c mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.) were injected subcutaneously once at the dosage shown below with ISIS 440762, 651900 or with PBS treated control. Each treatment group consisted of 4 animals. The mice were sacrificed 48 hours following the final administration to determine the SRB-1 mRNA levels in liver using real-time PCR and RIBOGREEN® RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, Oreg.) according to standard protocols. SRB-1 mRNA levels were determined relative to total RNA (using Ribogreen), prior to normalization to PBS-treated control. The results below are presented as the average percent of SRB-1 mRNA levels for each treatment group, normalized to PBS-treated control and is denoted as “% PBS”. As illustrated in Table 29, both antisense compounds lowered SRB-1 mRNA levels. Further, the antisense compound comprising the GalNAc3-1 conjugate (ISIS 651900) was substantially more potent than the antisense compound lacking the GalNAc3-1 conjugate (ISIS 440762). These results demonstrate that the potency benefit of GalNAc3-1 conjugates are observed using antisense oligonucleotides complementary to a different target and having different chemically modified nucleosides, in this instance modified nucleosides comprise constrained ethyl sugar moieties (a bicyclic sugar moiety).

A sample of whole blood from volunteered donors with informed consent at US HealthWorks clinic (Faraday & El Camino Real, Carlsbad) was obtained and collected in 4-15 BD Vacutainer CPT 8 ml tubes (VWR Cat.#BD362753). The approximate starting total whole blood volume in the CPT tubes for each donor was recorded using the PBMC assay data sheet. The blood sample was remixed immediately prior to centrifugation by gently inverting tubes 8-10 times. CPT tubes were centrifuged at rt (18-25° C.) in a horizontal (swing-out) rotor for 30 min at 1500-1800 RCF with brake off (2700 RPM Beckman Allegra 6R). The cells were retrieved from the buffy coat interface (between Ficoll and polymer gel layers); transferred to a sterile 50 ml conical tube and pooled up to 5 CPT tubes/50 ml conical tube/donor. The cells were then washed twice with PBS (Ca++, Mg++ free; GIBCO). The tubes were topped up to 50 ml and mixed by inverting several times. The sample was then centrifuged at 330×g for 15 minutes at rt (1215 RPM in Beckman Allegra 6R) and aspirated as much supernatant as possible without disturbing pellet. The cell pellet was dislodged by gently swirling tube and resuspended cells in RPMI+10% FBS+pen/strep (˜1 ml/10 ml starting whole blood volume). A 60 μl sample was pipette into a sample vial (Beckman Coulter) with 600 μl VersaLyse reagent (Beckman Coulter Cat#A09777) and was gently vortexed for 10-15 sec. The sample was allowed to incubate for 10 min at rt and being mixed again before counting. The cell suspension was counted on Vicell XR cell viability analyzer (Beckman Coulter) using PBMC cell type (dilution factor of 1:11 was stored with other parameters). The live cell/ml and viability were recorded. The cell suspension was diluted to 1×107 live PBMC/ml in RPMI+10% FBS+pen/strep. The cells were plated at 5×105 in 50 μl/well of 96-well tissue culture plate (Falcon Microtest). 50 μl/well of 2× concentration oligos/controls diluted in RPMI+10% FBS+pen/strep. was added according to experiment template (100 μl/well total). Plates were placed on the shaker and allowed to mix for approx. 1 min. After being incubated for 24 hrs at 37° C.; 5% CO2, the plates were centrifuged at 400×g for 10 minutes before removing the supernatant for MSD cytokine assay (i.e. human IL-6, IL-10, IL-8 and MCP-1). Example 24 Evaluation of Proinflammatory Effects in hPBMC Assay for GalNAc3-1 Conjugated ASOs The antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) listed in Table 30 were evaluated for proinflammatory effect in hPBMC assay using the protocol described in Example 23. ISIS 353512 is an internal standard known to be a high responder for IL-6 release in the assay. The hPBMCs were isolated from fresh, volunteered donors and were treated with ASOs at 0, 0.0128, 0.064, 0.32, 1.6, 8, 40 and 200 μM concentrations. After a 24 hr treatment, the cytokine levels were measured. The levels of IL-6 were used as the primary readout. The EC50 and Emax was calculated using standard procedures. Results are expressed as the average ratio of Emax/EC50 from two donors and is denoted as “Emax/EC50.” The lower ratio indicates a relative decrease in the proinflammatory response and the higher ratio indicates a relative increase in the proinflammatory response. With regard to the test compounds, the least proinflammatory compound was the PS/PO linked ASO (ISIS 616468). The GalNAc3-1 conjugated ASO, ISIS 647535 was slightly less proinflammatory than its non-conjugated counterpart ISIS 304801. These results indicate that incorporation of some PO linkages reduces proinflammatory reaction and addition of a GalNAc3-1 conjugate does not make a compound more proinflammatory and may reduce proinflammatory response. Accordingly, one would expect that an antisense compound comprising both mixed PS/PO linkages and a GalNAc3-1 conjugate would produce lower proinflammatory responses relative to full PS linked antisense compound with or without a GalNAc3-1 conjugate. These results show that GalNAc3-1 conjugated antisense compounds, particularly those having reduced PS content are less proinflammatory. Together, these results suggest that a GalNAc3-1 conjugated compound, particularly one with reduced PS content, can be administered at a higher dose than a counterpart full PS antisense compound lacking a GalNAc3-1 conjugate. Since half-life is not expected to be substantially different for these compounds, such higher administration would result in less frequent dosing. Indeed such administration could be even less frequent, because the GalNAc3-1 conjugated compounds are more potent (See Examples 20-22) and re-dosing is necessary once the concentration of a compound has dropped below a desired level, where such desired level is based on potency.

Example 41 General Method for the Preparation of ASOs Comprising a Phosphodiester Linked GalNAc3-2 (see Example 37, Bx is Adenine) Conjugate at the 5′ Position Via Solid Phase Techniques (Preparation of ISIS 661134) Unless otherwise stated, all reagents and solutions used for the synthesis of oligomeric compounds are purchased from commercial sources. Standard phosphoramidite building blocks and solid support are used for incorporation nucleoside residues which include for example T, A, G, and mC residues. Phosphoramidite compounds 56 and 60 were used to synthesize the phosphodiester linked GalNAc3-2 conjugate at the 5′ terminus. A 0.1 M solution of phosphoramidite in anhydrous acetonitrile was used for β-D-2′-deoxyribonucleoside and 2′-MOE. The ASO syntheses were performed on ABI 394 synthesizer (1-2 μmol scale) or on GE Healthcare Bioscience ÄKTA oligopilot synthesizer (40-200 μmol scale) by the phosphoramidite coupling method on VIMAD solid support (110 μmol/g, Guzaev et al., 2003) packed in the column. For the coupling step, the phosphoramidites were delivered at a 4 fold excess over the initial loading of the solid support and phosphoramidite coupling was carried out for 10 min. All other steps followed standard protocols supplied by the manufacturer. A solution of 6% dichloroacetic acid in toluene was used for removing the dimethoxytrityl (DMT) groups from 5′-hydroxyl groups of the nucleotide. 4,5-Dicyanoimidazole (0.7 M) in anhydrous CH3CN was used as activator during the coupling step. Phosphorothioate linkages were introduced by sulfurization with 0.1 M solution of xanthane hydride in 1:1 pyridine/CH3CN for a contact time of 3 minutes. A solution of 20% tert-butylhydroperoxide in CH3CN containing 6% water was used as an oxidizing agent to provide phosphodiester internucleoside linkages with a contact time of 12 minutes. After the desired sequence was assembled, the cyanoethyl phosphate protecting groups were deprotected using a 20% diethylamine in toluene (v/v) with a contact time of 45 minutes. The solid-support bound ASOs were suspended in aqueous ammonia (28-30 wt %) and heated at 55° C. for 6 h. The unbound ASOs were then filtered and the ammonia was boiled off. The residue was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a strong anion exchange column (GE Healthcare Bioscience, Source 30Q, 30 μm, 2.54×8 cm, A=100 mM ammonium acetate in 30% aqueous CH3CN, B=1.5 M NaBr in A, 0-40% of B in 60 min, flow 14 mL min-1, λ=260 nm). The residue was desalted by HPLC on a reverse phase column to yield the desired ASOs in an isolated yield of 15-30% based on the initial loading on the solid support. The ASOs were characterized by ion-pair-HPLC coupled MS analysis with Agilent 1100 MSD system.

Unconjugated ISIS 440762 and 651900 (GalNAc3-1 conjugate at 3′ terminus, see Example 9) were included in the study for comparison and are described previously in Table 17. Treatment Six week old male Balb/c mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.) were injected subcutaneously once at the dosage shown below with ISIS 440762, 651900, 661134 or with PBS treated control. Each treatment group consisted of 4 animals. The mice were sacrificed 72 hours following the final administration to determine the liver SRB-1 mRNA levels using real-time PCR and RIBOGREEN® RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, Oreg.) according to standard protocols. SRB-1 mRNA levels were determined relative to total RNA (using Ribogreen), prior to normalization to PBS-treated control. The results below are presented as the average percent of SRB-1 mRNA levels for each treatment group, normalized to PBS-treated control and is denoted as “% PBS”. The ED50s were measured using similar methods as described previously and are presented below. As illustrated in Table 35, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides lowered SRB-1 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. Indeed, the antisense oligonucleotides comprising the phosphodiester linked GalNAc3-2 conjugate at the 5′ terminus (ISIS 661134) or the GalNAc3-1 conjugate linked at the 3′ terminus (ISIS 651900) showed substantial improvement in potency compared to the unconjugated antisense oligonucleotide (ISIS 440762). Further, ISIS 661134, which comprises the phosphodiester linked GalNAc3-2 conjugate at the 5′ terminus was equipotent compared to ISIS 651900, which comprises the GalNAc3-1 conjugate at the 3′ terminus.

Pharmacokinetics Analysis (PK) The PK of the ASOs from the high dose group (7 mg/kg) was examined and evaluated in the same manner as illustrated in Example 20. Liver sample was minced and extracted using standard protocols. The full length metabolites of 661134 (5′ GalNAc3-2) and ISIS 651900 (3′ GalNAc3-1) were identified and their masses were confirmed by high resolution mass spectrometry analysis. The results showed that the major metabolite detected for the ASO comprising a phosphodiester linked GalNAc3-2 conjugate at the 5′ terminus (ISIS 661134) was ISIS 440762 (data not shown). No additional metabolites, at a detectable level, were observed. Unlike its counterpart, additional metabolites similar to those reported previously in Table 23a were observed for the ASO having the GalNAc3-1 conjugate at the 3′ terminus (ISIS 651900). These results suggest that having the phosphodiester linked GalNAc3-1 or GalNAc3-2 conjugate may improve the PK profile of ASOs without compromising their potency.

Oligomeric Compound 155, comprising a GalNAc3-6 conjugate group, was prepared using the general procedures illustrated in Example 46. The GalNAc3 cluster portion of the conjugate group GalNAc3-6 (GalNAc3-6a) can be combined with any cleavable moiety to provide a variety of conjugate groups. In certain embodiments, the cleavable moiety is —P(═O)(OH)-Ad-P(═O)(OH)—. The structure of GalNAc3-6 (GalNAc3-6a-CM-) is shown below: Example 52 Preparation of Oligonucleotide 160 Comprising GalNAc3-9 Compound 156 was synthesized following the procedure described in the literature (J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 5798-5808). Compound 156, (18.60 g, 29.28 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (200 mL). Palladium on carbon (6.15 g, 10 wt %, loading (dry basis), matrix carbon powder, wet) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature under hydrogen for 18 h. The reaction mixture was filtered through a pad of celite and the celite pad was washed thoroughly with methanol. The combined filtrate was washed and concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography and eluted with 5-10% methanol in dichloromethane to yield Compound 157 (14.26 g, 89%). Mass m/z 544.1 [M−H]−. Compound 157 (5 g, 9.17 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous DMF (30 mL). HBTU (3.65 g, 9.61 mmol) and N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (13.73 mL, 78.81 mmol) were added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes. To this a solution of compound 47 (2.96 g, 7.04 mmol) was added. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 8 h. The reaction mixture was poured into a saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic layer was washed with brine and dried (Na2SO4), filtered and evaporated. The residue obtained was purified by silica gel column chromatography and eluted with 50% ethyl acetate in hexane to yield compound 158 (8.25 g, 73.3%). The structure was confirmed by MS and 1H NMR analysis. Compound 158 (7.2 g, 7.61 mmol) was dried over P2O5 under reduced pressure. The dried compound was dissolved in anhydrous DMF (50 mL). To this 1H-tetrazole (0.43 g, 6.09 mmol) and N-methylimidazole (0.3 mL, 3.81 mmol) and 2-cyanoethyl-N,N,N′,N′-tetraisopropyl phosphorodiamidite (3.65 mL, 11.50 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred t under an argon atmosphere for 4 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (200 mL). The reaction mixture was washed with saturated NaHCO3 and brine. The organic phase was separated, dried (Na2SO4), filtered and evaporated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography and eluted with 50-90% ethyl acetate in hexane to yield Compound 159 (7.82 g, 80.5%). The structure was confirmed by LCMS and 31P NMR analysis. Oligomeric Compound 160, comprising a GalNAc3-9 conjugate group, was prepared using standard oligonucleotide synthesis procedures. Three units of compound 159 were coupled to the solid support, followed by nucleotide phosphoramidites. Treatment of the protected oligomeric compound with aqueous ammonia yielded compound 160. The GalNAc3 cluster portion of the conjugate group GalNAc3-9 (GalNAc3-9a) can be combined with any cleavable moiety to provide a variety of conjugate groups. In certain embodiments, the cleavable moiety is —P(═O)(OH)-Ad-P(═O)(OH)—. The structure of GalNAc3-9 (GalNAc3-9a-CM) is shown below: Example 53 Alternate Procedure for Preparation of Compound 18 (GalNAc3-1a and GalNAc3-3a) Lactone 161 was reacted with diamino propane (3-5 eq) or Mono-Boc protected diamino propane (1 eq) to provide alcohol 162a or 162b. When unprotected propanediamine was used for the above reaction, the excess diamine was removed by evaporation under high vacuum and the free amino group in 162a was protected using CbzCl to provide 162b as a white solid after purification by column chromatography. Alcohol 162b was further reacted with compound 4 in the presence of TMSOTf to provide 163a which was converted to 163b by removal of the Cbz group using catalytic hydrogenation. The pentafluorophenyl (PFP) ester 164 was prepared by reacting triacid 113 (see Example 48) with PFPTFA (3.5 eq) and pyridine (3.5 eq) in DMF (0.1 to 0.5 M). The triester 164 was directly reacted with the amine 163b (3-4 eq) and DIPEA (3-4 eq) to provide Compound 18. The above method greatly facilitates purification of intermediates and minimizes the formation of byproducts which are formed using the procedure described in Example 4. Example 54 Alternate Procedure for Preparation of Compound 18 (GalNAc3-1a and GalNAc3-3a) The triPFP ester 164 was prepared from acid 113 using the procedure outlined in example 53 above and reacted with mono-Boc protected diamine to provide 165 in essentially quantitative yield. The Boc groups were removed with hydrochloric acid or trifluoroacetic acid to provide the triamine which was reacted with the PFP activated acid 166 in the presence of a suitable base such as DIPEA to provide Compound 18. The PFP protected Gal-NAc acid 166 was prepared from the corresponding acid by treatment with PFPTFA (1-1.2 eq) and pyridine (1-1.2 eq) in DMF. The precursor acid in turn was prepared from the corresponding alcohol by oxidation using TEMPO (0.2 eq) and BAIB in acetonitrile and water. The precursor alcohol was prepared from sugar intermediate 4 by reaction with 1,6-hexanediol (or 1,5-pentanediol or other diol for other n values) (2-4 eq) and TMSOTf using conditions described previously in example 47.

Treatment Six week old male Balb/c mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.) were injected subcutaneously once at the dosage shown below with ISIS 353382, 655861, 664078, 661161, 665001 or with saline. Each treatment group consisted of 4 animals. The mice were sacrificed 72 hours following the final administration to determine the liver SRB-1 mRNA levels using real-time PCR and RIBOGREEN® RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, Oreg.) according to standard protocols. The results below are presented as the average percent of SRB-1 mRNA levels for each treatment group, normalized to the saline control. As illustrated in Table 40, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides lowered SRB-1 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. Indeed, the antisense oligonucleotides comprising the phosphodiester linked GalNAc3-1 and GalNAc3-9 conjugates at the 3′ terminus (ISIS 655861 and ISIS 664078) and the GalNAc3-3 and GalNAc3-8 conjugates linked at the 5′ terminus (ISIS 661161 and ISIS 665001) showed substantial improvement in potency compared to the unconjugated antisense oligonucleotide (ISIS 353382). Furthermore, ISIS 664078, comprising a GalNAc3-9 conjugate at the 3′ terminus was essentially equipotent compared to ISIS 655861, which comprises a GalNAc3-1 conjugate at the 3′ terminus. The 5′ conjugated antisense oligonucleotides, ISIS 661161 and ISIS 665001, comprising a GalNAc3-3 or GalNAc3-9, respectively, had increased potency compared to the 3′ conjugated antisense oligonucleotides (ISIS 655861 and ISIS 664078).

Example 58 Dose-Dependent Study of Oligonucleotides Comprising a 3′-Conjugate Group (Comparison of GalNAc3-1 and GalNAc4-11) Targeting SRB-1 In Vivo The oligonucleotides listed below were tested in a dose-dependent study for antisense inhibition of SRB-1 in mice. Unconjugated ISIS 440762 was included as an unconjugated standard. Each of the conjugate groups were attached at the 3′ terminus of the respective oligonucleotide by a phosphodiester linked 2′-deoxyadenosine nucleoside cleavable moiety. The structure of GalNAc3-1a was shown previously in Example 9. The structure of GalNAc3-11a was shown previously in Example 50. Treatment Six week old male Balb/c mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.) were injected subcutaneously once at the dosage shown below with ISIS 440762, 651900, 663748 or with saline. Each treatment group consisted of 4 animals. The mice were sacrificed 72 hours following the final administration to determine the liver SRB-1 mRNA levels using real-time PCR and RIBOGREEN® RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, Oreg.) according to standard protocols. The results below are presented as the average percent of SRB-1 mRNA levels for each treatment group, normalized to the saline control. As illustrated in Table 47, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides lowered SRB-1 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. The antisense oligonucleotides comprising the phosphodiester linked GalNAc3-1 and GalNAc4-11 conjugates at the 3′ terminus (ISIS 651900 and ISIS 663748) showed substantial improvement in potency compared to the unconjugated antisense oligonucleotide (ISIS 440762). The two conjugated oligonucleotides, GalNAc3-1 and GalNAc4-11, were equipotent.

Treatment The oligonucleotides listed above were tested in vitro in primary mouse hepatocyte cells plated at a density of 25,000 cells per well and treated with 0.03, 0.08, 0.24, 0.74, 2.22, 6.67 or 20 nM modified oligonucleotide. After a treatment period of approximately 16 hours, RNA was isolated from the cells and mRNA levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and the SRB-1 mRNA levels were adjusted according to total RNA content, as measured by RIBOGREEN®. The IC50 was calculated using standard methods and the results are presented in Table 53. The results show that, under free uptake conditions in which no reagents or electroporation techniques are used to artificially promote entry of the oligonucleotides into cells, the oligonucleotides comprising a GalNAc conjugate were significantly more potent in hepatocytes than the parent oligonucleotide (ISIS 353382) that does not comprise a GalNAc conjugate.

Furthermore, by 72 hours, 40-98% of each oligonucleotide comprising a GalNAc3 conjugate group was metabolized to the parent compound, indicating that the GalNAc3 conjugate groups were cleaved from the oligonucleotides. Example 76 Preparation of Oligomeric Compound 230 Comprising GalNAc3-23 Compound 222 is commercially available. 44.48 ml (0.33 mol) of compound 222 was treated with tosyl chloride (25.39 g, 0.13 mol) in pyridine (500 mL) for 16 hours. The reaction was then evaporated to an oil, dissolved in EtOAc and washed with water, sat. NaHCO3, brine, and dried over Na2SO4. The ethyl acetate was concentrated to dryness and purified by column chromatography, eluted with EtOAc/hexanes (1:1) followed by 10% methanol in CH2Cl2 to give compound 223 as a colorless oil. LCMS and NMR were consistent with the structure. 10 g (32.86 mmol) of 1-Tosyltriethylene glycol (compound 223) was treated with sodium azide (10.68 g, 164.28 mmol) in DMSO (100 mL) at room temperature for 17 hours. The reaction mixture was then poured onto water, and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with water three times and dried over Na2SO4. The organic layer was concentrated to dryness to give 5.3 g of compound 224 (92%). LCMS and NMR were consistent with the structure. 1-Azidotriethylene glycol (compound 224, 5.53 g, 23.69 mmol) and compound 4 (6 g, 18.22 mmol) were treated with 4A molecular sieves (5 g), and TMSOTf (1.65 ml, 9.11 mmol) in dichloromethane (100 mL) under an inert atmosphere. After 14 hours, the reaction was filtered to remove the sieves, and the organic layer was washed with sat. NaHCO3, water, brine, and dried over Na2SO4. The organic layer was concentrated to dryness and purified by column chromatography, eluted with a gradient of 2 to 4% methanol in dichloromethane to give compound 225. LCMS and NMR were consistent with the structure. Compound 225 (11.9 g, 23.59 mmol) was hydrogenated in EtOAc/Methanol (4:1, 250 mL) over Pearlman's catalyst. After 8 hours, the catalyst was removed by filtration and the solvents removed to dryness to give compound 226. LCMS and NMR were consistent with the structure. In order to generate compound 227, a solution of nitromethanetrispropionic acid (4.17 g, 15.04 mmol) and Hunig's base (10.3 ml, 60.17 mmol) in DMF (100 mL) were treated dropwise with pentafluorotrifluoro acetate (9.05 ml, 52.65 mmol). After 30 minutes, the reaction was poured onto ice water and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with water, brine, and dried over Na2SO4. The organic layer was concentrated to dryness and then recrystallized from heptane to give compound 227 as a white solid. LCMS and NMR were consistent with the structure. Compound 227 (1.5 g, 1.93 mmol) and compound 226 (3.7 g, 7.74 mmol) were stirred at room temperature in acetonitrile (15 mL) for 2 hours. The reaction was then evaporated to dryness and purified by column chromatography, eluting with a gradient of 2 to 10% methanol in dichloromethane to give compound 228. LCMS and NMR were consistent with the structure. Compound 228 (1.7 g, 1.02 mmol) was treated with Raney Nickel (about 2 g wet) in ethanol (100 mL) in an atmosphere of hydrogen. After 12 hours, the catalyst was removed by filtration and the organic layer was evaporated to a solid that was used directly in the next step. LCMS and NMR were consistent with the structure. This solid (0.87 g, 0.53 mmol) was treated with benzylglutaric acid (0.18 g, 0.8 mmol), HBTU (0.3 g, 0.8 mmol) and DIEA (273.7 μl, 1.6 mmol) in DMF (5 mL). After 16 hours, the DMF was removed under reduced pressure at 65° C. to an oil, and the oil was dissolved in dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed with sat. NaHCO3, brine, and dried over Na2SO4. After evaporation of the organic layer, the compound was purified by column chromatography and eluted with a gradient of 2 to 20% methanol in dichloromethane to give the coupled product. LCMS and NMR were consistent with the structure. The benzyl ester was deprotected with Pearlman's catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere for 1 hour. The catalyst was them removed by filtration and the solvents removed to dryness to give the acid. LCMS and NMR were consistent with the structure. The acid (486 mg, 0.27 mmol) was dissolved in dry DMF (3 mL). Pyridine (53.61 μl, 0.66 mmol) was added and the reaction was purged with argon. Pentafluorotrifluoro acetate (46.39 μl, 0.4 mmol) was slowly added to the reaction mixture. The color of the reaction changed from pale yellow to burgundy, and gave off a light smoke which was blown away with a stream of argon. The reaction was allowed to stir at room temperature for one hour (completion of reaction was confirmed by LCMS). The solvent was removed under reduced pressure (rotovap) at 70° C. The residue was diluted with DCM and washed with 1N NaHSO4, brine, saturated sodium bicarbonate and brine again. The organics were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and were concentrated to dryness to give 225 mg of compound 229 as a brittle yellow foam. LCMS and NMR were consistent with the structure. Oligomeric compound 230, comprising a GalNAc3-23 conjugate group, was prepared from compound 229 using the general procedure illustrated in Example 46. The GalNAc3 cluster portion of the GalNAc3-23 conjugate group (GalNAc3-23a) can be combined with any cleavable moiety to provide a variety of conjugate groups.

Treatment Six week old, male Sprague Dawley rats were each injected subcutaneously once per week at a dosage shown below, for a total of three doses, with an oligonucleotide listed in Table 67 or with PBS. Each treatment group consisted of 4 animals. The rats were sacrificed 72 hours following the final dose. AGT liver mRNA levels were measured using real-time PCR and RIBOGREEN® RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, Oreg.) according to standard protocols. AGT plasma protein levels were measured using the Total Angiotensinogen ELISA (Catalog #JP27412, IBL International, Toronto, ON) with plasma diluted 1:20,000. The results below are presented as the average percent of AGT mRNA levels in liver or AGT protein levels in plasma for each treatment group, normalized to the PBS control. As illustrated in Table 68, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides lowered AGT liver mRNA and plasma protein levels in a dose-dependent manner, and the oligonucleotide comprising a GalNAc conjugate was significantly more potent than the parent oligonucleotide lacking a GalNAc conjugate.

Blood was drawn the day before dosing to determine baseline and at 5, 12, 19, and 25 days following the dose. Plasma A1AT protein levels were measured via ELISA (see Example 80). The results below are presented as the average percent of plasma A1AT protein levels for each treatment group, normalized to baseline levels. The results show that the oligonucleotides comprising a GalNAc conjugate were more potent and had longer duration of action than the parent lacking a GalNAc conjugate (ISIS 476366). Furthermore, the oligonucleotides comprising a 5′-GalNAc conjugate (ISIS 678381, 678382, 678383, and 678384) were generally even more potent with even longer duration of action than the oligonucleotide comprising a 3′-GalNAc conjugate (ISIS 656326).

The oligonucleotides listed in Table 76 were added at 2, 10, 50, or 250 nM in Williams E medium and cells were incubated overnight at 37° C. in 5% CO2. Cells were lysed 16 hours following oligonucleotide addition, and total RNA was purified using RNease 3000 BioRobot (Qiagen). SRB-1 mRNA levels were determined using real-time PCR and RIBOGREEN® RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, Oreg.) according to standard protocols. IC50 values were determined using Prism 4 software (GraphPad). The results show that oligonucleotides comprising a variety of different GalNAc conjugate groups and a variety of different cleavable moieties are significantly more potent in an in vitro free uptake experiment than the parent oligonucleotides lacking a GalNAc conjugate group (ISIS 353382 and 666841).

Treatment Six to eight week old mice were each injected subcutaneously once with an oligonucleotide listed in Table 77 or with PBS. Each treatment group consisted of 4 animals. Blood was drawn by tail bleeds the day before dosing to determine baseline and at 3, 10, and 17 days following the dose. Plasma Factor XI protein levels were measured by ELISA using Factor XI capture and biotinylated detection antibodies from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn. (catalog #AF2460 and #BAF2460, respectively) and the OptEIA Reagent Set B (Catalog #550534, BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). The results below are presented as the average percent of plasma Factor XI protein levels for each treatment group, normalized to baseline levels. The results show that the oligonucleotides comprising a GalNAc conjugate were more potent with longer duration of action than the parent lacking a GalNAc conjugate (ISIS 404071). Furthermore, the oligonucleotides comprising a 5′-GalNAc conjugate (ISIS 663086, 678347, 678348, and 678349) were even more potent with an even longer duration of action than the oligonucleotide comprising a 3′-GalNAc conjugate (ISIS 656173).

Treatment Eight week old TTR transgenic mice were each injected subcutaneously once per week for three weeks, for a total of three doses, with an oligonucleotide and dosage listed in the tables below or with PBS. Each treatment group consisted of 4 animals. The mice were sacrificed 72 hours following the final administration. Tail bleeds were performed at various time points throughout the experiment, and plasma TTR protein, ALT, and AST levels were measured and reported in Tables 85-87. After the animals were sacrificed, plasma ALT, AST, and human TTR levels were measured, as were body weights, organ weights, and liver human TTR mRNA levels. TTR protein levels were measured using a clinical analyzer (AU480, Beckman Coulter, Calif.). Real-time PCR and RIBOGREEN® RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, Oreg.) were used according to standard protocols to determine liver human TTR mRNA levels. The results presented in Tables 84-87 are the average values for each treatment group. The mRNA levels are the average values relative to the average for the PBS group. Plasma protein levels are the average values relative to the average value for the PBS group at baseline. Body weights are the average percent weight change from baseline until sacrifice for each individual treatment group. Organ weights shown are normalized to the animal's body weight, and the average normalized organ weight for each treatment group is then presented relative to the average normalized organ weight for the PBS group. In Tables 84-87, “BL” indicates baseline, measurements that were taken just prior to the first dose. As illustrated in Tables 84 and 85, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides lowered TTR expression levels in a dose-dependent manner. The oligonucleotides comprising a GalNAc conjugate were more potent than the parent lacking a GalNAc conjugate (ISIS 420915). Furthermore, the oligonucleotides comprising a GalNAc conjugate and mixed PS/PO internucleoside linkages were even more potent than the oligonucleotide comprising a GalNAc conjugate and full PS linkages.

Treatment Six week old transgenic mice that express human SMN were injected subcutaneously once with an oligonucleotide listed in Table 91 or with saline. Each treatment group consisted of 2 males and 2 females. The mice were sacrificed 3 days following the dose to determine the liver human SMN mRNA levels both with and without exon 7 using real-time PCR according to standard protocols. Total RNA was measured using Ribogreen reagent. The SMN mRNA levels were normalized to total mRNA, and further normalized to the averages for the saline treatment group. The resulting average ratios of SMN mRNA including exon 7 to SMN mRNA missing exon 7 are shown in Table 91. The results show that fully modified oligonucleotides that modulate splicing and comprise a GalNAc conjugate are significantly more potent in altering splicing in the liver than the parent oligonucleotides lacking a GlaNAc conjugate. Furthermore, this trend is maintained for multiple modification chemistries, including 2′-MOE and morpholino modified oligonucleotides.

Treatment Eight week old, female C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.) were each injected subcutaneously once per week at a dosage shown below, for a total of six doses, with an oligonucleotide listed in Table 92 or with PBS. Each treatment group consisted of 3-4 animals. Tail bleeds were performed the day before the first dose and weekly following each dose to determine plasma Apo(a) protein levels. The mice were sacrificed two days following the final administration. Apo(a) liver mRNA levels were determined using real-time PCR and RIBOGREEN® RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, Oreg.) according to standard protocols. Apo(a) plasma protein levels were determined using ELISA, and liver transaminase levels were determined. The mRNA and plasma protein results in Table 93 are presented as the treatment group average percent relative to the PBS treated group. Plasma protein levels were further normalized to the baseline (BL) value for the PBS group. Average absolute transaminase levels and body weights (% relative to baseline averages) are reported in Table 94. As illustrated in Table 93, treatment with the oligonucleotides lowered Apo(a) liver mRNA and plasma protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the oligonucleotide comprising the GalNAc conjugate was significantly more potent with a longer duration of action than the parent oligonucleotide lacking a GalNAc conjugate. As illustrated in Table 94, transaminase levels and body weights were unaffected by the oligonucleotides, indicating that the oligonucleotides were well tolerated.

Treatment TTR transgenic mice were each injected subcutaneously once per week for three weeks, for a total of three doses, with an oligonucleotide and dosage listed in Table 96 or with PBS. Each treatment group consisted of 4 animals. Prior to the first dose, a tail bleed was performed to determine plasma TTR protein levels at baseline (BL). The mice were sacrificed 72 hours following the final administration. TTR protein levels were measured using a clinical analyzer (AU480, Beckman Coulter, Calif.). Real-time PCR and RIBOGREEN® RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, Oreg.) were used according to standard protocols to determine liver human TTR mRNA levels. The results presented in Table 96 are the average values for each treatment group. The mRNA levels are the average values relative to the average for the PBS group. Plasma protein levels are the average values relative to the average value for the PBS group at baseline. “BL” indicates baseline, measurements that were taken just prior to the first dose. As illustrated in Table 96, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides lowered TTR expression levels in a dose-dependent manner. The oligonucleotides comprising a GalNAc conjugate were more potent than the parent lacking a GalNAc conjugate (ISIS 420915), and oligonucleotides comprising a phosphodiester or deoxyadenosine cleavable moiety showed significant improvements in potency compared to the parent lacking a conjugate (see ISIS numbers 682883 and 666943 vs 420915 and see Examples 86 and 87).

Each treatment group consisted of 4 animals. The mice were sacrificed 72 hours following the final administration. Liver SRB-1 mRNA levels were measured using real-time PCR. SRB-1 mRNA levels were normalized to cyclophilin mRNA levels according to standard protocols. The results are presented as the average percent of SRB-1 mRNA levels for each treatment group relative to the saline control group. As illustrated in Table 101, treatment with antisense oligonucleotides lowered SRB-1 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner, and the gapmer oligonucleotides comprising a GalNAc conjugate and having wings that were either full cEt or mixed sugar modifications were significantly more potent than the parent oligonucleotide lacking a conjugate and comprising full cEt modified wings. Body weights, liver transaminases, total bilirubin, and BUN were also measured, and the average values for each treatment group are shown in Table 101. Body weight is shown as the average percent body weight relative to the baseline body weight (% BL) measured just prior to the oligonucleotide dose.

The structure of GalNAc3-7a was shown previously in Example 48. Ultrafree-MC ultrafiltration units (30,000 NMWL, low-binding regenerated cellulose membrane, Millipore, Bedford, Mass.) were pre-conditioned with 300 μL of 0.5% Tween 80 and centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 minutes, then with 300 μL of a 300 μg/mL solution of a control oligonucleotide in H2O and centrifuged at 2000 g for 16 minutes. In order to assess non-specific binding to the filters of each test oligonucleotide from Tables 70 and 106 to be used in the studies, 300 μL of a 250 ng/mL solution of oligonucleotide in H2O at pH 7.4 was placed in the pre-conditioned filters and centrifuged at 2000 g for 16 minutes. The unfiltered and filtered samples were analyzed by an ELISA assay to determine the oligonucleotide concentrations. Three replicates were used to obtain an average concentration for each sample. The average concentration of the filtered sample relative to the unfiltered sample is used to determine the percent of oligonucleotide that is recovered through the filter in the absence of plasma (% recovery). Frozen whole plasma samples collected in K3-EDTA from normal, drug-free human volunteers, cynomolgus monkeys, and CD-1 mice, were purchased from Bioreclamation LLC (Westbury, N.Y.). The test oligonucleotides were added to 1.2 mL aliquots of plasma at two concentrations (5 and 150 μg/mL). An aliquot (300 μL) of each spiked plasma sample was placed in a pre-conditioned filter unit and incubated at 37° C. for 30 minutes, immediately followed by centrifugation at 2000 g for 16 minutes. Aliquots of filtered and unfiltered spiked plasma samples were analyzed by an ELISA to determine the oligonucleotide concentration in each sample. Three replicates per concentration were used to determine the average percentage of bound and unbound oligonucleotide in each sample. The average concentration of the filtered sample relative to the concentration of the unfiltered sample is used to determine the percent of oligonucleotide in the plasma that is not bound to plasma proteins (% unbound). The final unbound oligonucleotide values are corrected for non-specific binding by dividing the % unbound by the % recovery for each oligonucleotide. The final % bound oligonucleotide values are determined by subtracting the final % unbound values from 100. The results are shown in Table 107 for the two concentrations of oligonucleotide tested (5 and 150 μg/mL) in each species of plasma. The results show that GalNAc conjugate groups do not have a significant impact on plasma protein binding. Furthermore, oligonucleotides with full PS internucleoside linkages and mixed PO/PS linkages both bind plasma proteins, and those with full PS linkages bind plasma proteins to a somewhat greater extent than those with mixed PO/PS linkages.

Example 98 Evaluation of Pro-Inflammatory Effects of Oligonucleotides Comprising a GalNAc Conjugate in hPMBC Assay The oligonucleotides listed in Table 109 and were tested for pro-inflammatory effects in an hPMBC assay as described in Examples 23 and 24. (See Tables 30, 83, 95, and 108 for descriptions of the oligonucleotides.) ISIS 353512 is a high responder used as a positive control, and the other oligonucleotides are described in Tables 83, 95, and 108. The results shown in Table 109 were obtained using blood from one volunteer donor. The results show that the oligonucleotides comprising mixed PO/PS internucleoside linkages produced significantly lower pro-inflammatory responses compared to the same oligonucleotides having full PS linkages. Furthermore, the GalNAc conjugate group did not have a significant effect in this assay.

The competitor ligand, α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), was incubated in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5) with 1 U neuraminidase-agarose for 16 hours at 37° C., and >90% desialylation was confirmed by either sialic acid assay or size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Iodine monochloride was used to iodinate the AGP according to the procedure by Atsma et al. (see J Lipid Res. 1991 January; 32(1):173-81.) In this method, desialylated α1-acid glycoprotein (de-AGP) was added to 10 mM iodine chloride, Na125I, and 1 M glycine in 0.25 M NaOH. After incubation for 10 minutes at room temperature, 125I-labeled de-AGP was separated from free 125I by concentrating the mixture twice utilizing a 3 KDMWCO spin column. The protein was tested for labeling efficiency and purity on a HPLC system equipped with an Agilent SEC-3 column (7.8×300 mm) and a B-RAM counter. Competition experiments utilizing 125I-labeled de-AGP and various GalNAc-cluster containing ASOs were performed as follows. Human HepG2 cells (106 cells/ml) were plated on 6-well plates in 2 ml of appropriate growth media. MEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-Glutamine and 10 mM HEPES was used. Cells were incubated 16-20 hours@37° C. with 5% and 10% CO2 respectively. Cells were washed with media without FBS prior to the experiment. Cells were incubated for 30 min@37° C. with 1 ml competition mix containing appropriate growth media with 2% FBS, 10−8 M 125I-labeled de-AGP and GalNAc-cluster containing ASOs at concentrations ranging from 10−11 to 10−5 M. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10−2 M GalNAc sugar. Cells were washed twice with media without FBS to remove unbound 125I-labeled de-AGP and competitor GalNAc ASO. Cells were lysed using Qiagen's RLT buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Lysates were transferred to round bottom assay tubes after a brief 10 min freeze/thaw cycle and assayed on a γ-counter. Non-specific binding was subtracted before dividing 125I protein counts by the value of the lowest GalNAc-ASO concentration counts. The inhibition curves were fitted according to a single site competition binding equation using a nonlinear regression algorithm to calculate the binding affinities (KD's). The results in Table 110 were obtained from experiments performed on five different days. Results for oligonucleotides marked with superscript “a” are the average of experiments run on two different days. The results show that the oligonucleotides comprising a GalNAc conjugate group on the 5′-end bound the asialoglycoprotein receptor on human HepG2 cells with 1.5 to 16-fold greater affinity than the oligonucleotides comprising a GalNAc conjugate group on the 3′-end.

Treatment Female transgenic mice that express human Apo(a) were each injected subcutaneously once per week, for a total of 6 doses, with an oligonucleotide and dosage listed in Table 111b or with PBS. Each treatment group consisted of 3 animals. Blood was drawn the day before dosing to determine baseline levels of Apo(a) protein in plasma and at 72 hours, 1 week, and 2 weeks following the first dose. Additional blood draws will occur at 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, and 6 weeks following the first dose. Plasma Apo(a) protein levels were measured using an ELISA. The results in Table 111b are presented as the average percent of plasma Apo(a) protein levels for each treatment group, normalized to baseline levels (% BL), The results show that the oligonucleotides comprising a GalNAc conjugate group exhibited potent reduction in Apo(a) expression. This potent effect was observed for the oligonucleotide that comprises full PS internucleoside linkages and the oligonucleotide that comprises mixed PO and PS linkages.

C57Bl/6 mice were each injected subcutaneously once with an oligonucleotide listed in Table 112 or with PBS. Each treatment group consisted of 4 animals. Each mouse treated with ISIS 440670 received a dose of 2, 6, 20, or 60 mg/kg. Each mouse treated with ISIS 680772 or 696847 received 0.6, 2, 6, or 20 mg/kg. The GalNAc conjugate group of ISIS 696847 is linked via a stable moiety, a phosphorothioate linkage instead of a readily cleavable phosphodiester containing linkage. The animals were sacrificed 72 hours after the dose. Liver APOC-III mRNA levels were measured using real-time PCR. APOC-III mRNA levels were normalized to cyclophilin mRNA levels according to standard protocols. The results are presented in Table 112 as the average percent of APOC-III mRNA levels for each treatment group relative to the saline control group. The results show that the oligonucleotides comprising a GalNAc conjugate group were significantly more potent than the oligonucleotide lacking a conjugate group. Furthermore, the oligonucleotide comprising a GalNAc conjugate group linked to the oligonucleotide via a cleavable moiety (ISIS 680772) was even more potent than the oligonucleotide comprising a GalNAc conjugate group linked to the oligonucleotide via a stable moiety (ISIS 696847).

Example 102 Distribution in Liver of Antisense Oligonucleotides Comprising a GalNAc Conjugate The liver distribution of ISIS 353382 (see Table 36) that does not comprise a GalNAc conjugate and ISIS 655861 (see Table 36) that does comprise a GalNAc conjugate was evaluated. Male balb/c mice were subcutaneously injected once with ISIS 353382 or 655861 at a dosage listed in Table 113. Each treatment group consisted of 3 animals except for the 18 mg/kg group for ISIS 655861, which consisted of 2 animals. The animals were sacrificed 48 hours following the dose to determine the liver distribution of the oligonucleotides. In order to measure the number of antisense oligonucleotide molecules per cell, a Ruthenium (II) tris-bipyridine tag (MSD TAG, Meso Scale Discovery) was conjugated to an oligonucleotide probe used to detect the antisense oligonucleotides. The results presented in Table 113 are the average concentrations of oligonucleotide for each treatment group in units of millions of oligonucleotide molecules per cell. The results show that at equivalent doses, the oligonucleotide comprising a GalNAc conjugate was present at higher concentrations in the total liver and in hepatocytes than the oligonucleotide that does not comprise a GalNAc conjugate. Furthermore, the oligonucleotide comprising a GalNAc conjugate was present at lower concentrations in non-parenchymal liver cells than the oligonucleotide that does not comprise a GalNAc conjugate. And while the concentrations of ISIS 655861 in hepatocytes and non-parenchymal liver cells were similar per cell, the liver is approximately 80% hepatocytes by volume. Thus, the majority of the ISIS 655861 oligonucleotide that was present in the liver was found in hepatocytes, whereas the majority of the ISIS 353382 oligonucleotide that was present in the liver was found in non-parenchymal liver cells.

Each treatment group consisted of 3 animals. Blood was drawn before dosing to determine baseline and at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days following the dose. Plasma triglyceride and APOC-III protein levels were measured as described in Example 20. The results in Table 115 are presented as the average percent of plasma triglyceride and APOC-III levels for each treatment group, normalized to baseline levels. A comparison of the results in Table 71 of example 79 with the results in Table 115 below show that oligonucleotides comprising a mixture of phosphodiester and phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages exhibited increased duration of action than equivalent oligonucleotides comprising only phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages.

The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes, then poured into water (80 mL) and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (2×100 mL). The organic phase was separated and washed with sat. aqueous NaHCO3 (3×80 mL), 1 M NaHSO4 (3×80 mL) and brine (2×80 mL), then dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to yield compound 233. LCMS and NMR were consistent with the structure. Compound 233 (0.59 g, 0.48 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (2.2 mL) and ethyl acetate (2.2 mL). Palladium on carbon (10 wt % Pd/C, wet, 0.07 g) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred under hydrogen atmosphere for 3 h. The reaction mixture was filtered through a pad of Celite and concentrated to yield the carboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid (1.32 g, 1.15 mmol, cluster free acid) was dissolved in DMF (3.2 mL). To this N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.3 mL, 1.73 mmol) and PFPTFA (0.30 mL, 1.73 mmol) were added. After 30 min stirring at room temperature the reaction mixture was poured into water (40 mL) and extracted with EtOAc (2×50 mL). A standard work-up was completed as described above to yield compound 234. LCMS and NMR were consistent with the structure. Oligonucleotide 235 was prepared using the general procedure described in Example 46.

The GalNAc1 cluster portion (GalNAc1-25a) of the conjugate group GalNAc1-25 can be combined with any cleavable moiety present on the oligonucleotide to provide a variety of conjugate groups. The structure of GalNAc1-25 (GalNAc1-25a-CM) is shown below: Example 106 Antisense Inhibition In Vivo by Oligonucleotides Targeting SRB-1 Comprising a 5′-GalNAc2 or a 5′-GalNAc3 Conjugate Oligonucleotides listed in Tables 116 and 117 were tested in dose-dependent studies for antisense inhibition of SRB-1 in mice. Treatment Six to week old, male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.) were injected subcutaneously once with 2, 7, or 20 mg/kg of ISIS No. 440762; or with 0.2, 0.6, 2, 6, or 20 mg/kg of ISIS No. 686221, 686222, or 708561; or with saline. Each treatment group consisted of 4 animals. The mice were sacrificed 72 hours following the final administration. Liver SRB-1 mRNA levels were measured using real-time PCR. SRB-1 mRNA levels were normalized to cyclophilin mRNA levels according to standard protocols. The antisense oligonucleotides lowered SRB-1 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner, and the ED50 results are presented in Tables 116 and 117. Although previous studies showed that trivalent GalNAc-conjugated oligonucleotides were significantly more potent than divalent GalNAc-conjugated oligonucleotides, which were in turn significantly more potent than monovalent GalNAc conjugated oligonucleotides (see, e.g., Khorev et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem., Vol. 16, 5216-5231 (2008)), treatment with antisense oligonucleotides comprising monovalent, divalent, and trivalent GalNAc clusters lowered SRB-1 mRNA levels with similar potencies as shown in Tables 116 and 117.

The structure of GalNAc1-25a was shown in Example 105. The concentrations of the oligonucleotides in Tables 116 and 117 in liver were also assessed, using procedures described in Example 75. The results shown in Tables 117a and 117b below are the average total antisense oligonucleotide tissues levels for each treatment group, as measured by UV in units of μg oligonucleotide per gram of liver tissue. The results show that the oligonucleotides comprising a GalNAc conjugate group accumulated in the liver at significantly higher levels than the same dose of the oligonucleotide lacking a GalNAc conjugate group. Furthermore, the antisense oligonucleotides comprising one, two, or three GalNAc ligands in their respective conjugate groups all accumulated in the liver at similar levels. This result is surprising in view of the Khorev et al. literature reference cited above and is consistent with the activity data shown in Tables 116 and 117 above.

The nucleobase sequence of the antisense strand of the duplex comprises at least a portion of an oligonucleotide in Table 121. The ends of the strands may be modified by the addition of one or more natural or modified nucleobases to form an overhang. The sense strand of the dsRNA is then designed and synthesized as the complement of the antisense strand and may also contain modifications or additions to either terminus. For example, in one embodiment, both strands of the dsRNA duplex would be complementary over the central nucleobases, each having overhangs at one or both termini. For example, a duplex comprising an antisense strand having the sequence CGAGAGGCGGACGGGACCG (SEQ ID NO: 12) and having a two-nucleobase overhang of deoxythymidine (dT) would have the following structure (Antisense SEQ ID NO: 13, Complement SEQ ID NO: 14): In another embodiment, a duplex comprising an antisense strand having the same sequence CGAGAGGCGGACGGGACCG (SEQ ID NO: 12) may be prepared with blunt ends (no single stranded overhang) as shown (Antisense SEQ ID NO: 15, Complement SEQ ID NO: 16): RNA strands of the duplex can be synthesized by methods disclosed herein or purchased from Dharmacon Research Inc., (Lafayette, Colo.). Once synthesized, the complementary strands are annealed. The single strands are aliquoted and diluted to a concentration of 50 μM. Once diluted, 30 μL of each strand is combined with 15 μL of a 5× solution of annealing buffer. The final concentration of said buffer is 100 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, and 2 mM magnesium acetate. The final volume is 75 μL. This solution is incubated for 1 minute at 90° C. and then centrifuged for 15 seconds. The tube is allowed to sit for 1 hour at 37° C. at which time the dsRNA duplexes are used in experimentation. The final concentration of the dsRNA duplex is 20 μM. This solution can be stored frozen (−20° C.) and freeze-thawed up to 5 times. Once prepared, the duplexed antisense compounds are evaluated for their ability to modulate apolipoprotein C-III expression. When cells reached 80% confluency, they are treated with duplexed antisense compounds of the invention. For cells grown in 96-well plates, wells are washed once with 200 μL OPTI-MEM-1™ reduced-serum medium (Gibco BRL) and then treated with 130 μL of OPTI-MEM-1™ medium containing 12 μg/mL LIPOFECTIN™ reagent (Gibco BRL) and the desired duplex antisense compound at a final concentration of 200 nM. After 5 hours of treatment, the medium is replaced with fresh medium. Cells are harvested 16 hours after treatment, at which time RNA is isolated and target reduction measured by RT-PCR. Example 114 Antisense Inhibition of Human Apolipoprotein C-III Expression by Chimeric Phosphorothioate Oligonucleotides Having 2′-MOE Wings and a Deoxy Gap In accordance with the present invention, a series of antisense compounds was designed to target different regions of the human apolipoprotein C-III RNA, using published sequences (nucleotides 6238608 to 6242565 of GenBank accession number NT—035088.1, representing a genomic sequence, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 3, and GenBank accession number NM—000040.1, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 1). The compounds are shown in Table 121. “Target site” indicates the first (5′-most) nucleotide number on the particular target sequence to which the compound binds. All compounds in Table 121 are chimeric oligonucleotides (“gapmers”) 20 nucleotides in length, composed of a central “gap” region consisting of ten 2′-deoxynucleotides, which is flanked on both sides (5′ and 3′ directions) by five-nucleotide “wings”. The wings are composed of 2′-O-(2-methoxyethyl)nucleotides, also known as (2′-MOE)nucleotides. The internucleoside (backbone) linkages are phosphorothioate (P═S) throughout the oligonucleotide. All cytidine residues are 5-methylcytidines. The compounds were analyzed for their effect on human apolipoprotein C-III mRNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR as described in other examples herein.

Example 115 Antisense Inhibition of Mouse Apolipoprotein C-III Expression by Chimeric Phosphorothioate Oligonucleotides Having 2′-MOE Wings and a Deoxy Gap In accordance with the present invention, a second series of antisense compounds was designed to target different regions of the mouse apolipoprotein C-III RNA, using published sequences (GenBank accession number L04150.1, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 11). The compounds are shown in Table 2. “Target site” indicates the first (5′-most) nucleotide number on the particular target nucleic acid to which the compound binds. All compounds in Table 2 are chimeric oligonucleotides (“gapmers”) 20 nucleotides in length, composed of a central “gap” region consisting of ten 2′-deoxynucleotides, which is flanked on both sides (5′ and 3′ directions) by five-nucleotide “wings”. The wings are composed of 2′-O-(2-methoxyethyl)nucleotides, also known as (2′-MOE)nucleotides. The internucleoside (backbone) linkages are phosphorothioate (P═S) throughout the oligonucleotide. All cytidine residues are 5-methylcytidines. The compounds were analyzed for their effect on mouse apolipoprotein C-III mRNA levels by quantitative real-time PCR as described in other examples herein. Data are averages from three experiments in which mouse primary hepatocyte cells were treated with the antisense oligonucleotides of the present invention. If present, “N.D.” indicates “no data”.

present invention, one of skill in the art will recognize or be able to ascertain, using no more than routine experimentation, further embodiments of the invention that encompass other compounds that specifically hybridize to these preferred target segments and consequently inhibit the expression of apolipoprotein C-III. According to the present invention, antisense compounds include antisense oligomeric compounds, antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides, alternate splicers, primers, probes, and other short oligomeric compounds that hybridize to at least a portion of the target nucleic acid. Example 116 Antisense Inhibition of Human Apolipoprotein C-III Expression by Chimeric Phosphorothioate Oligonucleotides Having 2′-MOE Wings and a Deoxy Gap—Additional Antisense Compounds In accordance with the present invention, an additional series of antisense compounds was designed to target different regions of the human apolipoprotein C-III RNA, using published sequences (nucleotides 6238608 to 6242565 of the sequence with GenBank accession number NT—035088.1, representing a genomic sequence, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 3, and GenBank accession number NM—000040.1, incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 1). The compounds are shown in Table 124. “Target site” indicates the first (5′-most) nucleotide number on the particular target sequence to which the compound binds. All compounds in Table 124 are chimeric oligonucleotides (“gapmers”) 20 nucleotides in length, composed of a central “gap” region consisting of ten 2′-deoxynucleotides, which is flanked on both sides (5′ and 3′ directions) by five-nucleotide “wings”. The wings are composed of 2′-O-(2-methoxyethyl)nucleotides, also known as (2′-MOE)nucleotides. The internucleoside (backbone) linkages are phosphorothioate (P═S) throughout the oligonucleotide. All cytidine residues are 5-methylcytidines.

Pre-plated primary Cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes were purchased from InVitro Technologies (Baltimore, Md.). Cells were cultured in high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.), 100 units/mL and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.). Cells at a density of 80,000 cells per well in a 24-well plate were treated with 10, 50, 150 and 300 nM of ISIS 304789 (SEQ ID NO: 75), ISIS 304799 (SEQ ID NO: 85) or ISIS 304800 (SEQ ID NO: 86). ISIS 113529 (CTCTTACTGTGCTGTGGACA, SEQ ID NO: 17) served as a control oligonucleotide. ISIS 113529 is a chimeric oligonucleotide (“gapmer”) 20 nucleotides in length, composed of a central “gap” region consisting of ten 2′-deoxynucleotides, which is flanked on both sides (5′ and 3′ directions) by five-nucleotide “wings”. The wings are composed of 2′-O-(2-methoxyethyl)nucleotides, also known as (2′-MOE)nucleotides. The internucleoside (backbone) linkages are phosphorothioate (P═S) throughout the oligonucleotide. All cytidine residues are 5-methylcytidines. Following 24 hours of treatment with antisense oligonucleotides, apolipoprotein C-III mRNA was measured by real-time PCR as described by other examples herein, using the primers and probe designed to the human apolipoprotein C-III sequence (forward primer: TCAGCTTCATGCAGGGTTACAT (SEQ ID NO: 5) reverse primer: ACGCTGCTCAGTGCATCCT (SEQ ID NO: 6) and the PCR probe was: FAM-AAGCACGCCACCAAGACCGCC-TAMRA (SEQ ID NO: 7)) to measure Cynomolgus monkey apolipoprotein C-III mRNA. Primers and probe designed to human GAPDH (forward primer: GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC (SEQ ID NO: 8) reverse primer: GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC (SEQ ID NO: 9) and the PCR probe was: 5′ JOE-CAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAGCC-TAMRA 3′ (SEQ ID NO: 10)) were used to measure Cynomolgus monkey GAPDH mRNA expression, for the purpose of normalizing gene target quantities obtained by real-time PCR. Untreated cells served as the control to which data were normalized. Data are the average of three experiments and are presented in the table below.

Positions 8 to 476 of the human apolipoprotein C-III mRNA sequence (incorporated in its entirety herein as SEQ ID NO: 1) contain the target segment to which ISIS 304789 hybridizes. The corresponding region of Cynomolgus monkey apolipoprotein C-III mRNA was sequenced. RNA was isolated and purified from primary Cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes (InVitro Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.) and was subjected to a reverse transcriptase reaction (kit from Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.). The resultant cDNA was the substrate for 40 rounds of PCR amplification, using 5′ and 3′ primers designed to positions 8 and 476, respectively, of the human apolipoprotein C-III mRNA (Amplitaq PCR kit, Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.). Following gel purification of the resultant 468 bp fragment, the forward and reverse sequencing reactions of each product were performed by Retrogen (San Diego, Calif.). This Cynomolgus monkey sequence is incorporated herein as SEQ ID NO: 223 and is 92% identical to positions 8 to 476 of the human apolipoprotein C-III mRNA.
