TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass and a production method the same. BACKGROUND ART A Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass contains, as a main crystal, a β-quartz solid solution (Li2O.Al2O3.nSiO2 [n ≧2]) or a β-spodumene solid solution (Li2O.Al2O3.nSiO2 [n≧4]), and hence, it has such characteristic that expansion is extremely low and that mechanical strength is high. Therefore, the Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass has excellent thermal characteristics. In addition, since a crystal to be precipitated can be changed by changing a heat treatment condition in a crystallization step, both a transparent crystallized glass in which a β-quartz solid solution precipitates and a white opaque crystallized glass in which a β-spodumene solid solution precipitates can be produced from a mother glass (crystallizable glass) of the same composition and used for different purposes according to an application. Making use of such characteristics, the Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass previously has been used for various applications; such as front windows of oil stoves, wood stoves, and the like, substrates for high-technology products such as color filter substrates, image sensor substrates, substrates for top plates of electromagnetic cookers, gas cookers, and the like, window glasses for fire-retarding doors, base materials for reflecting mirrors to be used for projectors such as liquid crystal projectors, or light source lamps for illumination, setters for heat treatment of electronic components or plasma display panels, trays for microwave ovens, and electronic components or precision machine components. CITATION LIST Patent Document Patent Document 1: JP-A-11-228180 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention In the case of producing a crystallized glass of this kind, in view of the fact that high-temperature viscosity of the glass is high, melting at high temperatures exceeding 1,600° C. is required. In a glass with high viscosity, since bubbles are difficult to come to the surface, the bubbles in a glass melt are hardly removed. Then, As2O3 or Sb2O3 is widely used as a fining agent. Now, there is a possibility that As2O3 or Sb2O3 pollutes the environment at the time of glass producing process or waste glass treatment or the like because of high toxicity thereof. As a solution, it is investigated to use SnO2, CeO2, Cl, or the like in place of As2O3 or Sb2O3. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass using SnO2 and Cl in combination as a fining agent. However, there is a problem that even when SnO2, CeO2, Cl, or the like is used as a fining agent in place of As2O3 or Sb2O3, a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass with excellent bubble quality is not always obtainable. In particular, this tendency conspicuously occurs in the case of producing the glass by a tank furnace for continuous production. If melting is performed using a crucible in a laboratory under a stationary condition, a glass with good bubble quality is obtained, whereas in the case of applying to a tank furnace for continuous production, in many cases, a glass with good bubble quality is not obtained. An object of the present invention is to provide a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass with excellent bubble quality even without using As2O3 or Sb2O3 as a fining agent and a method for producing the same. Means for Solving the Problems The present inventors made extensive and intensive investigations. As a result, it has been found that a reason why a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass with excellent bubble quality is not stably obtained by using a tank furnace for continuous production resides in reboil of S (sulfur) which is incorporated from a glass raw material. Namely, S which is incorporated from a raw material or the like is comprised as an impurity in a glass melt. In particular, there may be the case where a lot of S is comprised as an impurity in Li2CO3 which is used as a Li2O raw material. In addition, in the Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass, since the S solubility of the glass melt is low, S is present in an instable state in the melt. Then, S is easily gasified due to a little change in the state (for example, oxidation-reduction, composition change, and temperature change). In comparison with the case where melting is performed in a stationary state as in a crucible test in a laboratory, in a tank furnace for continuous production, a fluctuation in a charging condition of the raw material or a melting condition is large, and liquation of a refractory possibly occurs. Therefore, a state change of glass is liable to occur, and reboil due to S is liable to generate, so that it is difficult to obtain a product with good bubble quality. Even such a condition, in the case of using As2O3 or Sb2O3 as a fining agent, the S component in the glass melt is removed by a lot of a fining gas released from such a fining agent component, and the S concentration in the melt remarkably decreases. In addition, if As2O3 or Sb2O3 is present in the melt, such a fining agent component oxidizes S, thereby making S stably exist in a state of SO42− in the glass melt. Therefore, SO42− is hardly decomposed into SO2 (gas)+O2, so that it is possible to suppress the gasification. However, other fining agents than As2O3 or Sb2O3 are small in an effect for removing S from the glass melt or an effect for making S stably exist in a state of SO42− in the glass melt. As a result, a so-called reboil phenomenon in which S is bubbled as a SO2 gas or the like from the glass melt is easy to occur. For example, if S is gasified in an amount of 1 ppm in terms of SO3, it is calculated that several thousand to several ten thousand bubbles/kg are produced. Therefore, how to prevent reboil of S from occurring is very important in obtaining a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass with less bubbles. This importance is a phenomenon which is hardly recognized on a level of the laboratory test using a crucible (in the case of using a platinum crucible, since liquation of the crucible component hardly occurs, reboil due to S hardly occurs) and which has recognized first by the production in a tank furnace for continuous production under a condition in which As2O3 or Sb2O3 is not comprised. The present inventors have led to a proposal of the present invention on the basis of the foregoing knowledge. Specifically, the Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass of the present invention is characterized to be a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass, which does not substantially comprise As2O3 and Sb2O3 and comprises at least one of Cl, CeO2 and SnO2, and has a S content of not more than 10 ppm in terms of SO3. It is meant by the terms “not substantially comprise As2O3 and Sb2O3” as referred to in the present invention that the contents of these components are respectively not more than 100 ppm including impurities. The “Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass” means a crystallized glass comprising Li2O, Al2O3 and SiO2 as essential components, and precipitating a n-quartz solid solution and/or a β-spodumene solid solution as a main crystal. It is meant by the terms “comprises at least one of Cl, CeO2 and SnO2” that these components are comprised solely or in combination and that a content thereof is 0.02% by mass or more in terms of a combined content. The “S content” is a value determined by first dipping an analysis sample in Na2CO3 by means of alkali fusion and filtering with a filter paper, and subsequently stirring a filtrate thereof with an ion exchange resin and again filtering, followed by measuring by means of ion chromatography. In the present invention, it is preferable to comprise Cl in an amount of from 200 to 1,500 ppm. The content of Cl is a value determined by subjecting a plate-shaped analysis sample to mirror polishing and measuring by a fluorescent X-ray analyzer. By adopting the foregoing constitution, it is possible to obtain a crystallized glass with excellent clarity. In the present invention, it is preferable that CeO2 is not substantially comprised and SnO2 is comprised in an amount of from 0.1 to 0.5% by mass. It is meant by the terms “CeO2 is not substantially comprised” as referred to in the present invention that the content of CeO2 is not more than 200 ppm including impurities. In the case of using SnO2 or CeO2 as a fining agent, there is a concern that the crystallized glass is colored. Though details of the mechanism in which the crystallized glass is colored are unclear, it may be considered that SnO2 or CeO2 reduces Fe that is an impurity at the stage of a heat treatment for crystallizing a glass. In particular, as to CeO2, its influence is large. Then, by adopting the foregoing constitution, it is possible to effectively prevent the coloration of the Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass from occurring. In addition, in the case of not using Cl, it becomes possible to effectively avoid corrosion of forming equipment or the like. In addition, by adding SnO2, it is possible to decrease the amount of dissolved SO3 in the glass. It may be considered that this is caused due to the fact that the S component in the glass melt is removed by a fining gas released from the fining agent component. In addition, SnO2 has properties of releasing a fining gas at a higher temperature than that in As2O3 or Sb2O3 and hardly releases oxygen at the initial stage of melting where the temperature is low. Namely, even if SnO2 is added, the atmosphere at the initial stage of melting hardly becomes oxidative. In view of the fact that when the atmosphere at the initial stage of melting becomes oxidative, S is easily dissolved into the glass melt, so that the amount of remaining S is liable to become large, it may be considered that if SnO2 is used, it is possible to effectively suppress the dissolution of S at the initial stage of melting. In the present invention, it is preferable to comprise from 50 to 80% of SiO2, from 12 to 30% of Al2O3, from 1 to 6% of Li2O, from 0 to 5% of MgO, from 0 to 10% of ZnO, from 0 to 8% of BaO, from 0 to 5% of Na2O, from 0 to 10% of K2O, from 0 to 8% of TiO2, from 0 to 7% of ZrO2, and from 0 to 7% of P2O5, in terms of a percentage by mass. According to the foregoing constitution, it is possible to easily obtain a crystallized glass in which a β-quartz solid solution or a β-spodumene solid solution precipitates as a main crystal and which is extremely low in expansion and high in mechanical strength. In the present invention, it is preferable to comprise from 20.5 to 30% by mass of Al2O3 and from 0.1 to 0.5% by mass of SnO2 and satisfy a relation of 3.7≦Li2O+0.741MgO+0.367ZnO≦4.5 in terms of a mass ratio. Similar to CeO2, there is a concern that SnO2 causes coloration of the crystallized glass. Then, in the case of using SnO2 as a fining agent, by defining the composition to the foregoing range, it becomes possible to reduce the coloration problem. In addition, the Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass of the present invention is characterized to be a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass, which does not substantially comprise As2O3 and SB2O3, comprises Cl, and has a S content of not more than 10 ppm in terms of SO3 and a β-OH value of 0.2 /mm or more. It is meant by the terms “not substantially comprise As2O3 and Sb2O3” as referred to in the present invention that the contents of these components are respectively not more than 100 ppm including impurities. The “Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass” means a crystallized glass comprising Li2O, Al2O3 and SiO2 as essential components, and precipitating a β-quartz solid solution and/or a β-spodumene solid solution as a main crystal. The “S content” is a value determined by first dipping an analysis sample in Na2CO3 by means of alkali fusion and filtering with a filter paper, and subsequently stirring a filtrate thereof with an ion exchange resin and again filtering, followed by measuring by means of ion chromatography. The “β-OH value” is a value calculated according to the following equation. [in-line-formulae]β-OH value (/mm)={log (T3850/T3500)}/t [/in-line-formulae] T3850: Transmittance at 3850 cm− T3500: Lowest transmittance in an absorption band in the vicinity of 3500 cm−1 t: Plate thickness of sample (mm) In the present invention, it is preferable to comprise Cl in an amount of from 50 to 1,500 ppm. The content of Cl is a value determined by subjecting a plate-shaped analysis sample to mirror polishing and measuring by a fluorescent X-ray analyzer. By adopting the foregoing constitution, it is possible to obtain a crystallized glass with excellent clarity. In the present invention, it is preferable that CeO2 is not substantially comprised, and a content of SnO2 is not more than 0.5% by mass. It is meant by the terms “CeO2 is not substantially comprised” as referred to in the present invention that the content of such component is not more than 200 ppm including impurities. In the case of using SnO2 or CeO2 as a fining agent, there is a concern that the crystallized glass is colored. Though details of the mechanism in which the crystallized glass is colored are unclear, it may be considered that SnO2 or CeO2 reduces Fe that is an impurity at the stage of a heat treatment for crystallizing a glass. In particular, as to CeO2, its influence is large. Then, by adopting the foregoing constitution, it is possible to effectively prevent the coloration of the Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass from occurring. Incidentally, by adding SnO2, it is possible to decrease the amount of dissolved SO3 in the glass. It may be considered that this is caused due to the fact that the S component in the glass melt is removed by a fining gas released from the fining agent component. In addition, SnO2 has properties of releasing a fining gas at a higher temperature than that in As2O3 or Sb2O3 and hardly releases oxygen at the initial stage of melting where the temperature is low. Namely, even if SnO2 is added, the atmosphere at the initial stage of melting hardly becomes oxidative. In view of the fact that when the atmosphere at the initial stage of melting becomes oxidative, S is easily dissolved into the glass melt, so that the amount of remaining S is liable to become large, it may be considered that if SnO2 is used, it is possible to effectively suppress the dissolution of S at the initial stage of melting. In the present invention, it is preferable to comprise from 50 to 80% of SiO2, from 12 to 30% of Al2O3, from 1 to 6% of Li2O, from 0 to 5% of MgO, from 0 to 10% of ZnO, from 0 to 8% of BaO, from 0 to 5% of Na2O, from 0 to 10% of K2O, from 0 to 8% of Ti02, from 0 to 7% of ZrO2, and from 0 to 7% of P2O5, in terms of a percentage by mass. According to the foregoing constitution, it is possible to easily obtain a crystallized glass in which a β-quartz solid solution or a β-spodumene solid solution precipitates as a main crystal and which is extremely low in expansion and high in mechanical strength. In addition, the method for producing a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass of the present invention is characterized to be a method for producing a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass not substantially comprising As2O3 and Sb2O3, which comprises performing selection of a glass raw material and adjustment of a production condition so as to comprise at least one of Cl, CeO2 and SnO2, and have a S content of not more than 10 ppm in terms of SO3. The “selection of a glass raw material” as referred to in the present invention means selection of kind, grain size, purity, and the like of the glass raw material. The “adjustment of a production condition” means adjustment of melting temperature, heating system, melting efficiency, and the like. The “Ce compound” means an oxide, a chloride, a hydroxide, a nitrate, or the like comprising a Ce element. The “Sn compound” means an oxide, a chloride, or the like comprising a Sn element. In addition, the method for producing a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass of the present invention is characterized to be a method for producing a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass not substantially comprising As2O3 and Sb2O3, which comprises adding at least one of a chloride, a Ce compound and a Sn compound to a glass raw material batch, and controlling a content of S comprised in a glass raw material to not more than 150 ppm in terms of SO3. The “glass raw material batch” as referred to in the present invention means a mixture excluding a chloride, a Ce compound, and a Sn compound in the glass raw material. The “content of S comprised in a glass raw material” is one, in terms of SO3, with respect to a value determined by dipping an analysis sample in Na2CO3 by means of alkali fusion and filtering with a filter paper, and subsequently stirring a filtrate thereof with an ion exchange resin and again filtering, followed by measuring by means of ion chromatography. In the present invention, it is preferable to add the chloride in an amount of from 0.04 to 0.3% by mass in terms of Cl based on 100% by mass of the glass raw material batch. By adopting the foregoing constitution, it becomes possible to sufficiently fine the glass. In the present invention, it is preferable that the Ce compound is not added and SnO2 is comprised in an amount of from 0.1 to 0.5% by mass. According to the foregoing constitution, it becomes easy to obtain a coloration-free Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass. In addition, in the case of not using Cl, it becomes possible to effectively avoid corrosion of forming equipment or the like. In the present invention, it is preferable to compound the glass raw material batch so as to form a glass comprising from 50 to 80% of SiO2, from 12 to 30% of Al2O3, from 1 to 6% of Li2O, from 0 to 5% of MgO, from 0 to 10% of ZnO, from 0 to 8% of BaO, from 0 to 5% of Na2O, from 0 to 10% of K2O, from 0 to 8% of TiO2, from 0 to 7% of ZrO2, and from 0 to 7% of P2O5, in terms of a percentage by mass. According to the foregoing constitution, it is possible to easily produce a crystallized glass in which a β-quartz solid solution or a β-spodumene solid solution precipitates as a main crystal and which is extremely low in expansion and high in mechanical strength.

According to the foregoing constitution, even in the case of using SnO2 as a fining agent, it becomes possible to reduce the coloration problem. In addition, by adding SnO2, it is possible to decrease the dissolved SO3 amount in the glass. In addition, the method for producing a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass of the present invention is characterized to be a method for producing a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass not substantially comprising As2O3 and Sb2O3, wherein a chloride is added to the glass raw material batch, and the glass raw material and/or a melting condition is adjusted such that a content of S comprised in a glass raw material is controlled to not more than 150 ppm in terms of SO3, and such that a β-OH value of the obtained crystallized glass is 0.2 /mm or more. The “glass raw material batch” as referred to herein means a mixture excluding a fining agent such as a chloride in the glass raw material. In addition, the “content of S comprised in a glass raw material” is one, in terms of SO3, with respect to a value determined by dipping an analysis sample in Na2CO3 by means of alkali fusion and filtering with a filter paper, and subsequently stirring a filtrate thereof with an ion exchange resin and again filtering, followed by measuring by means of ion chromatography. In the present invention, it is preferable to add the chloride in an amount of from 0.01 to 0.3% by mass in terms of Cl based on 100% by mass of the glass raw material batch. By adopting the foregoing constitution, it becomes possible to sufficiently fine the glass. In the present invention, it is preferable that the Ce compound is not added and the Sn compound is added as SnO2 in an amount of not more than 0.5% by mass. According to the foregoing constitution, it becomes easy to obtain a coloration-free Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass. In the present invention, it is preferable to compound the glass raw material batch so as to foam a glass comprising from 50 to 80% of SiO2, from 12 to 30% of Al2O3, from 1 to 6% of Li2O, from 0 to 5% of MgO, from 0 to 10% of ZnO, from 0 to 8% of BaO, from 0 to 5% of Na2O, from 0 to 10% of K2O, from 0 to 8% of TiO2, from 0 to 7% of ZrO2, and from 0 to 7% of P2O5, in terms of a percentage by mass. According to the foregoing constitution, it is possible to easily produce a crystallized glass in which a β-quartz solid solution or a β-spodumene solid solution precipitates as a main crystal and which is extremely low in expansion and high in mechanical strength. In the present invention, it is preferable to melt the glass in a tank furnace. According to the foregoing constitution, by applying to a tank furnace in which reboil of S is liable to occur, the effects of the present invention can be appropriately enjoyed. Effects of the Invention According to the present invention, in view of the fact that the content of S comprised in the crystallized glass is a few, reboil of S is hardly generated. In consequence, even when As2O3 or Sb2O3 is not comprised, it is possible to stably obtain a crystallized glass with excellent bubble quality. In addition, by adopting a constitution in which the contents of CeO2 and SnO2 are controlled, it becomes easy to effectively suppress reboil while preventing coloration of the glass from occurring. MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass of the present invention is a glass which is preferable from the environmental standpoint because it does not substantially comprise As2O3 and Sb2O3. Then, Cl, CeO2, and/or SnO2 are comprised as a substitute fining agent for them. The cause of bubbling generated in the case of not comprising As2O3 or Sb2O3 resides in the S component comprised in the glass melt. In consequence, it is desirable that the content of the S component in the glass melt is small as far as possible. In the present invention, the S content, in terms of SO3, is not more than 10 ppm, preferably less than 10 ppm, not more than 8 ppm, less than 8 ppm, not more than 5 ppm, and especially preferably less than 5 ppm. As a method for reducing the S amount in the glass, it is desirable to use a raw material with a less S component. In addition thereto, however, there may be adopted measures such as (1) a method of adding SnO2, (2) a method of increasing a water content in the glass melt in the presence of Cl, (3) a method of adjusting a grain size of a SiO2 raw material, (4) a method of optimizing a batch melting temperature, and (5) a method of optimizing a melting efficiency. Incidentally, details of these measures are described later. In addition, in the Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass of the present invention, at least one of Cl, CeO2, and SnO2 can be comprised as the refining agent. Cl has ability to sufficiently fine the glass and is preferable as the fining agent. In order to secure sufficient clarity, a content of Cl is preferably from 200 to 1,500 ppm, more preferably from 400 to 1,000 ppm, and even more preferably from 500 to 900 ppm. When the content of Cl is too small, the clarity is insufficient. On the other hand, when the content of Cl is too large, the volatilization amount as HCl is large, so that incidental equipment of the furnace is liable to be corroded. Now, when Cl is used, there may be the case where incidental equipment of the furnace, especially forming equipment, is corroded, so that the forming efficiency is lowered. Then, in the case where it is intended to solve the corrosion problem of the forming equipment, other fining agent than Cl, namely CeO2 or SnO2, may be used. However, such components tend to color the glass. In particular, CeO2 is larger in an influence on the coloration. Therefore, in the case where it is intended to prevent the coloration of the glass, it is preferable to comprise SnO2 in an amount of from 0.1 to 0.5% by mass without substantially comprising CeO2. By adopting such a constitution, for example, in the case of a transparent crystallized glass in which a β-quartz solid solution precipitates, the transmittance at 400 nm is liable to become 83% or more, and especially 85% or more at the thickness of 1.1 mm. A suitable composition range in the Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass of the present invention is one comprising from 50 to 80% of SiO2, from 12 to 30% of Al2O3, from 1 to 6% of Li2O, from 0 to 5% of MgO, from 0 to 10% of ZnO, from 0 to 8% of BaO, from 0 to 5% of Na2O, from 0 to 10% of K2O, from 0 to 8% of TiO2, from 0 to 7% of ZrO2, and from 0 to 7% of P2O5, in terms of a percentage by mass. The reasons why the composition range is defined in this way are described below. Incidentally, the term “%” hereinafter means “% by mass” unless otherwise indicated. SiO2 is a component of forming a skeleton of the glass and constituting a crystal, and its content is from 50 to 80%, preferably from 52 to 77%, and more preferably from 54 to 75%. When the content of SiO2 is too small, the coefficient of thermal expansion becomes excessively large, whereas when the content of SiO2 is too large, melting of the glass becomes difficult. Al2O3 is a component of forming a skeleton of the glass and constituting a crystal, and its content is from 12 to 30%, preferably from 13 to 28%, and more preferably from 14 to 26%. When the content of Al2O3 is too small, chemical durability is lowered, and the glass is liable to devitrify. On the other hand, when the content of Al2O3 is too large, the viscosity of the glass becomes too large, so that melting of the glass becomes difficult. Li2O is a crystal constituent component, and it gives a large influence in crystallinity and also works to lower the viscosity of the glass. In addition, Li is combined with chlorine in the melt to become relatively stable LiCl, which volatilizes to act as a fining gas. For that reason, in the Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass, even when Cl is used solely as the fining agent, by comprising a large amount of Li2O, it becomes possible to obtain a sufficient fining force. A content of Li2O is from 1 to 6%, preferably from 1.2 to 5.5%, and more preferably from 1.4 to 5.0%. In particular, in the case where the fining agent is Cl solely without using an oxide fining agent such as SnO2 and CeO2, it is preferable that the content Li2O is 3% or more. When the content of Li2O is too small, the crystallinity of the glass is so weak that the coefficient of thermal expansion becomes too large. In addition, in the case of a transparent crystallized glass, a crystal is liable to yield a white turbidity, and in the case of a white crystallized glass, a lowering of whiteness is liable to occur. In addition to this, fining with Cl solely becomes difficult. On the other hand, when the content of Li2O is too large, the crystallinity is too strong, so that the glass devitrifies, or a metastable β-quartz solid solution is not obtained, and a crystal yields a white turbidity. Thus, it may be impossible to obtain a transparent crystallized glass. Incidentally, in the case of using SnO2, 2.5% or more is preferable. A content of MgO is from 0 to 5%, preferably 0 to 4.5%, and more preferably from 0 to 4%. When the content of MgO is too large, the crystallinity becomes strong, and the amount of a precipitated crystal increases, so that the coloration by impurities becomes too strong. A content of ZnO is from 0 to 10%, preferably 0 to 8%, more preferably from 0 to 6%, and still more preferably from 0 to 5%. When the content of ZnO is too large, the crystallinity becomes strong, and the amount of a precipitated crystal increases, so that the coloration by impurities becomes too strong. In addition, the content of MgO and ZnO is preferably from 0 to 10%, more preferably from 0 to 8%, and even more preferably from 0 to 6% in terms of a combined content (total amount). When the combined content of these components is too large, the coloration of the crystal is liable to become strong. A content of BaO is from 0 to 8%, preferably from 0.3 to 7%, and more preferably from 0.5 to 6%. When the content of BaO is too large, crystallization of a crystal is impaired, so that a sufficient crystal amount is not obtained, and the coefficient of thermal expansion becomes too large. Furthermore, in the case of obtaining a transparent crystallized glass, the crystal is liable to yield a white turbidity. A content of Na2O is from 0 to 5%, preferably from 0 to 4%, and more preferably from 0 to 0.35%. When the content of Na2O is too large, the crystallinity becomes weak, so that a sufficient crystal amount is not obtained, and the coefficient of thermal expansion becomes too large. Furthermore, in the case of obtaining a transparent crystallized glass, the crystal is liable to yield a white turbidity. A content of 1(20 is from 0 to 10%, preferably from 0 to 8%, more preferably from 0 to 6%, and still more preferably from 0 to 5%. When the content of K2O is too large, the crystallinity becomes weak, so that a sufficient crystal amount can not be obtained, and the coefficient of thermal expansion becomes too large. Furthermore, in the case of obtaining a transparent crystallized glass, the crystal is liable to yield a white turbidity. In addition, the content of Na2O and K2O is preferably from 0 to 12%, more preferably from 0 to 10%, and even more preferably from 0 to 8% in terms of a combined content (total amount). When the combined content of these components is too large, the coefficient of thermal expansion is liable to become large. Furthermore, in the case of obtaining a transparent crystallized glass, the crystal is liable to yield a white turbidity. TiO2 is a nucleation agent, and its content is from 0 to 8%, preferably from 0.3 to 7%, and more preferably from 0.5 to 6%. In particular, in the case of comprising SnO2, it is preferable that from 1.5 to 3%, from 1.6 to 2.5%, and especially from 1.7 to 2.3%. When the content of TiO2 is too large, the coloration by impurities becomes remarkable. ZrO2 is a nucleation agent, and its content is from 0 to 7%, preferably from 0.5 to 6%, and more preferably from 1 to 5%. When the content of ZrO2 is too large, not only melting of the glass becomes difficult, but devitrification tendency of the glass becomes strong. In addition, in the case of comprising SnO2, a combined content of TiO2 and ZrO2 is preferably from 3.8 to 5%. P2O5 is a component for enhancing the crystallinity of the glass, and its content is from 0 to 7%, preferably from 0 to 6%, and more preferably from 0 to 5%. When the content of P2O5 is too large, the coefficient of thermal expansion becomes too large. In addition, in the case of obtaining a transparent crystallized glass, the crystal is liable to yield a white turbidity. In the Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass of the present invention, it is possible to add various components other than the foregoing components. For example, each of SrO and CaO may be comprised in an amount of up to 5%, and B2O3 may be comprised in an amount of up to 10%. In addition, for example, V2O5 can be comprised as a colorant in an amount of up to 1.5%, preferably up to 1.0%, and more preferably up to 0.8%. Incidentally, in the case of comprising SnO2, SrO and CaO satisfy a range of SrO+1.847CaO of preferably not more than 0.5, more preferably not more than 0.4, and especially preferably not more than 0.2. When the SrO+1.847CaO exceeds 0.5, a degree of coloration of the crystallized glass becomes large, and white turbidity is liable to generate. Incidentally, in the present invention, as already described, for the reason from the environmental standpoint, it is important that As2O3 and Sb2O3 are not substantially comprised. Cl, CeO2, and SnO2 may be used as a substitute fining agent for them. Here, a combination of the fining agents may be properly selected depending upon required characteristics and the like. For example, in the case where the coloration of the glass is prevented from occurring, it is preferable to use Cl, or to use CeO2 and SnO2 while strictly limiting their contents. In the case where it is intended to prevent corrosion of forming equipment or the like from occurring, it is preferable to use CeO2 or SnO2. In the case where it is intended to prevent both coloration of the glass and corrosion of forming equipment from occurring, it is preferable to comprise only SnO2 without using Cl and CeO2. Incidentally, according to investigations made by the present inventors, it has become clear that when the Al2O3 amount in a glass matrix phase (remaining glass phase) in the crystallized glass is large, the coloration due to SnO2 is reduced. In order to increase the Al2O3 amount in a glass matrix phase, it is effective to increase the Al2O3 amount in a mother glass composition. However, even when only the Al2O3 amount in a mother glass composition is simply increased, there is a tendency that a large proportion of Al2O3 as increased is distributed as a crystal constituent component into a crystal phase, and the Al2O3 amount in a glass matrix phase hardly increases. Then, in the present invention, in the case of using SnO2, it is desirable to increase Al2O3 and simultaneously to define Li2O, MgO, and ZnO to specified ranges. This is because Li2O, MgO, and ZnO tend to become crystal constituent components together with Al2O3, and by defining the contents of these components, the Al2O3 amount to be distributed into the crystal phase can be decreased. Specifically, it is preferable to comprise from 20.5 to 30% of Al2O3 and from 0.1 to 0.5% of SnO2 and to adjust Li2O, MgO, and ZnO to a range of 3.7≦Li2O+0.741MgO+0.367ZnO≦4.5 in terms of a mass ratio. By adopting this constitution, it is possible to increase the Al2O3 amount in the glass matrix phase in the crystallized glass, thereby effectively reducing the coloration due to SnO2. Incidentally, the coefficients of MgO and ZnO are those for reducing the content of each of the components into a mole of Li2O. Incidentally, it is preferable that the content of Al2O3 is from 20.5 to 30%, from 21 to 28%, and especially from 21.5 to 26%. In the foregoing constitution, when the content of Al2O3 is smaller than 20.5%, an effect of SnO2 for reducing the strengthening of coloration due to TiO2 and Fe2O3 is hardly obtained. On the other hand, when the content of Al2O3 is too large, the viscosity of the glass becomes too large, so that melting of the glass becomes difficult. In the foregoing constitution, it is preferable that the content of SnO2 is from 0.1 to 0.5%, from 0.1 to 0.4%, and especially from 0.1 to 0.3%. When the content of SnO2 is less than 0.1%, the effect as the fining agent is hardly obtained. On the other hand, when the content of SnO2 exceeds 0.5%, the coloration becomes too strong, so that the crystallized glass is liable to become yellowish. In addition, devitrification is liable to occur. In the foregoing constitution, it is preferable that the Li2O+0.741 MgO+0.367ZnO satisfies the range of from 3.7 to 4.5, from 3.8 to 4.4, and especially from 3.8 to 4.2. When the Li2O+0.741MgO+0.367ZnO exceeds 4.5, the Al2O3 amount in the glass phase in the crystallized glass decreases, so that the effect for suppressing coloration by Al2O3 is hardly obtained. On the other hand, when the Li2O+0.741 MgO+0.367ZnO is less than 3.7, a grain diameter of a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystal in the crystallized glass becomes large, so that white turbidity is liable to generate. As a result, there is a concern that a transparent feeling of the crystallized glass is impaired. Next, the method of the present invention for producing the foregoing Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass is described. First of all, a glass raw material batch is prepared so as to have a desired composition. As a glass composition, a glass comprising from 50 to 80% of SiO2, from 12 to 30% of Al2O3, from 1 to 6% of Li2O, from 0 to 5% of MgO, from 0 to 10% of ZnO, from 0 to 8% of BaO, from 0 to 5% of Na2O, from 0 to 10% of K2O, from 0 to 8% of TiO2, from 0 to 7% of ZrO2, and from 0 to 7% of P2O5 can be exemplified. The reasons for definition and suitable ranges with respect to this glass composition range are those as already described, and therefore, explanations thereof are omitted herein. Furthermore, at least one of a chloride, a Ce compound, and a Sn compound is added as a fining agent to the glass raw material batch. In the case of adding a chloride, its addition amount is from 0.04 to 0.3%, preferably from 0.08 to 0.2%, and more preferably from 0.1 to 0.18% in terms of Cl based on 100% by mass of the glass raw material batch. In the case of adding a Ce compound, as to its addition amount, a content of from 0 to 0.2%, preferably from 0 to 0.15%, and more preferably from 0 to 0.1% in terms of CeO2 based on 100% by mass of the glass raw material batch is added. In the case of adding a Sn compound, as to its addition amount, a content of from 0 to 0.5%, preferably from 0 to 0.3%, and more preferably from 0 to 0.2% in terms of SnO2 based on 100% by mass of the glass raw material batch is added. Incidentally, as already described, it is important that As2O3 and Sb2O3 are not added to the glass raw material. In addition, in an application in which the coloration of the glass is strictly controlled, in the case of using SnO2 as a fining agent, it is preferable to prepare a glass so as to comprise from 20.5 to 30% by mass of Al2O3 and from 0.1 to 0.5% by mass of SnO2 and to fall within a range of 3.7≦Li2O+0.741MgO+0.367ZnO≦4.5. The reasons for definition and suitable ranges with respect to this glass composition range are those as already described, and therefore, explanations thereof are omitted herein. In order that the S amount in the thus obtained glass may not be more than 10 ppm in terms of SO3, the amount of S which is incorporated as an impurity in the raw material is controlled to not more than 150 ppm, preferably not more than 100 ppm, and more preferably not more than 60 ppm in terms of SO3. In order to decrease the S content in the raw material, a glass raw material with high purity is selected. Measures such as a selection of a grass raw material with high purity or a pre-treatment of the glass raw material may be adopted. Subsequently, the glass raw material is melted by melting furnace, especially a tank furnace capable of achieving continuous production. In the case of a glass of the foregoing composition, it is preferable that a melting condition is at a maximum temperature of from 1,600 to 1,800° C. for from about 20 to 200 hours. Subsequently, the glass melt is formed into a desired shape to obtain a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallizable glass. As a forming method, various methods such as roll forming, press forming, and float forming can be adopted. The “crystallizable glass” as referred to herein means a glass being an amorphous state and having such properties that when heat treated, it precipitates a crystal from a glass matrix to become a crystallized glass. Subsequently, a formed body consisting of a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallizable glass is held at from 700 to 800° C. for from 1 to 4 hours to achieve nucleation. In the case of obtaining a transparent crystallized glass, a heat treatment is carried out at from 800 to 950° C. for from 0.5 to 3 hours, thereby precipitating a β-quartz solid solution. In addition, in the case of obtaining a white opaque crystallized glass, after the nucleation, a heat treatment may be carried out at from 1,050 to 1,250° C. for from 0.5 to 2 hours, thereby precipitating a β-spodumene solid solution. In this way, it is possible to obtain a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass which does not substantially comprise As2O3 and Sb2O3. Incidentally, the obtained Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass is provided for various applications after being subjected to post processing such as cutting, polishing, bending processing and drawing forming, or being subjected to decoration on the surface. Incidentally, as a measure for more decreasing the S amount in the crystallized glass, there may be adopted methods such as (1) a method of adding SnO2, (2) a method of increasing a water content in the glass melt in the presence of Cl, (3) a method of increasing a water content in the glass melt in the presence of Cl adjusting a grain size of a SiO2 raw material, (4) a method of optimizing a batch melting temperature, and (5) a method of optimizing a melting efficiency. By properly combining these methods, it becomes possible to obtain a crystallized glass with a smaller S content. Each of these methods is hereunder described in detail. (1) Method of adding SnO2: By adding SnO2, it is possible to decrease the amount of dissolved SO3 in the glass. It may be considered that this is caused due to the fact that the S component in the glass melt is removed by a fining gas released from the fining agent component. In addition, SnO2 has properties of releasing a fining gas at a higher temperature than that in As2O3 or Sb2O3 and hardly releases oxygen at the initial stage of melting where the temperature is low. Namely, even if SnO2 is added, the atmosphere at the initial stage of melting hardly becomes oxidative. In view of the fact that when the atmosphere at the initial stage of melting becomes oxidative, S is easily dissolved into the glass melt, so that the remaining S amount is liable to become large, it may be considered that if SnO2 is used, it is possible to effectively suppress the dissolution of S at the initial stage of melting. In the case of adopting this method, an addition amount of SnO2 is preferably not less than 0.1% by mass. (2) Method of Adjusting a Water Content in the Glass Melt in the Presence of Cl: According to investigations by the present inventors, different from a soda lime glass or the like having a high S solubility, in the Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass having a low S solubility, even by simply increasing the water content, the S content in the glass melt cannot be decreased. However, when Cl is present in the glass melt, it is possible to remarkably decrease the S content. Though details of this mechanism are unclear, it may be considered that when water and Cl are coexistent, a HCl gas is generated, and following the gas generation, S volatilizes, so that the S content in the glass melt decreases. The larger the water content in the glass melt, the higher the effect for decreasing the S amount is. In order to increase the water content in the glass melt, there can be adopted methods such as a method of using a raw material with a high water content, a method of increasing the water content in a combustion gas at the time of glass melting, and a method of bubbling a water vapor in the molten glass. In addition, the water content of the glass melt can be expressed by a β-OH value of the crystallized glass. In the present invention, the β-OH value of the crystallized glass is preferably 0.2 /mm or more, more preferably from 0.3 /mm to 4/mm, and even more preferably from 0.35 /mm to 4 /mm. In the case where the crystallized glass is opaque, it is also possible to specify it in terms of a β-OH value of the crystallizable glass. A suitable β-OH value of the crystallizable glass is preferably 0.25 /mm or more, more preferably 0.30 /mm or more, and even more preferably 0.36/mm or more. [in-line-formulae]β-OH value (/mm)={log (T3850/T3500)}/t [/in-line-formulae] T3850: Transmittance at 3850 cm−1 T3500: Lowest transmittance in an absorption band in the vicinity of 3500 cm−1 t: Plate thickness of sample (mm) (3) Method of Adjusting a Grain Size of a SiO2 Raw Material In the case of a glass with a low S solubility, such as a Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass, the S amount in the glass melt is influenced by a condition of initial melting at which the raw material is melted. When a dissolution process of the raw material in the Li2O—Al2O3—SiO2 based crystallized glass is analyzed, an initial melt with a small SiO2 component is first formed, into which the SiO2 raw material is then dissolved. Here, when the glass melt is reviewed from the point of view of acidity, since SiO2 is a component having a high acidity, the acidity of the initial melt is low, and the acidity increases with progress of the dissolution of the SiO2 raw material. In view of the fact that when the acidity of the glass is lower, S is more easily dissolved into the melt, it may be considered that when the acidity of the initial melt is lower, a glass melt comprising a lot of S is liable to be formed. In other words, so far as SiO2 is liable to be dissolved at the stage of initial dissolution of the raw material, S is hardly dissolved into the glass melt. As a result, reboil due to S is hardly generated. From these reasons, it is desirable to make a grain size of the SiO2 raw material small, thereby making it easy to dissolve the SiO2 raw material. Specifically, as to the SiO2 raw material, one having an average grain diameter of preferably not more than 180 μm, not more than 120 μm, and especially not more than 100 μm is used. However, when the grain size of the SiO2 raw material is too small, at the time of charging the raw material, only the surface is rapidly melted by radiant heat, so that the S component in the inside is hardly volatilized and scattered. As a result, there is brought a situation that the S amount of the glass melt does not decrease. Then, it is preferable that a dissolution speed of the SiO2 raw material does not become excessively high. Specifically, the average grain diameter of the SiO2 raw material is preferably 45 μm or more, 50 μm or more, and especially 60 μm or more. The “average grain diameter” as referred to herein means as follows. That is, when sieves having various openings are used, proportions of grains passing through the sieves are measured, and a graph showing a relation between the opening and the proportion of grains passing through the sieve is prepared, a size of the opening of the sieve through which the grains in an amount corresponding to 50% pass is defined as the average grain diameter. Incidentally, the method of adjusting the grain size of the SiO2 raw material can also be applied to other silica glasses. (4) Method of Optimizing a Batch Melting Temperature: It is desirable to set a batch melting temperature preferably at a temperature of log η=2.3 to 3.0, more preferably at a temperature of log η=2.3 to 2.9, and even more preferably at a temperature of log η=2.4 to 2.9. Here, n is dPa·s. When the batch melting temperature is too high, the batch becomes in a state of being easily melted, and at the time of charging the raw material, only the surface is rapidly melted by radiant heat, so that the S component in the inside is hardly volatilized and scattered. On the other hand, when the batch melting temperature is too low, since the SiO2 raw material is hardly melted, an initial melt with low acidity is formed, and the S content is liable to become high. Incidentally, the batch melting temperature can be determined by measuring a side wall in the vicinity of the glass raw material batch having been put in a glass melting furnace by using a radiation thermometer. (5) Method of Optimizing a Melting Efficiency: By prolonging the melting time, it becomes possible to remove unlined bubbles in the glass melt. In addition, the S amount can be decreased. However, long-term melting lowers the productivity, and it is difficult to provide an inexpensive glass. In addition, when the melting time is too long, a hetero layer is liable to be formed on the glass surface due to volatilization. As already described, in a glass with low S solubility, S is easily gasified by a slight change of the state such as a composition change. Under these circumstances, it is desirable to appropriately control the melting time. As an index of the melting time, a melting efficiency (melting area/flow rate) can be adopted. Specifically, the melting efficiency is preferably from 1.0 to 5.0 m2/(t/day), and especially preferably from 1.5 to 4.5 m2/(t/day). EXAMPLES The present invention is hereunder described by reference to the following Examples.

First of all, silica sand, alumina, lithium carbonate, barium nitrate, magnesium oxide, sodium nitrate, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and the like were compounded so as to have a composition shown in Table 1 (each of the numeral values shown in Table 1 means a mass percentage). Furthermore, NaCl, SnO2, and CeO2 were added in proportions shown in Table, followed by uniformly mixing. Thereafter, this raw material batch was put into a refractory furnace (tank furnace for continuous production) by oxygen combustion and melted at a melting efficiency of 2.5 m2/(t/day). Incidentally, the Cl amount “<50 ppm” of Samples Nos. 1 to 3 and 9 to 12 in Table shows that the Cl amount comprised as an impurity is less than 50 ppm. Subsequently, the glass melt was stirred with a platinum stirrer and then roll formed in a thickness of 4 mm, followed by cooling to room temperature within an annealing furnace. Thereafter, the crystallizable glass sample obtained by cutting into a prescribed length was analyzed with respect to SO3 amount, Cl amount, SnO2 amount, and CeO2 amount in the glass. In addition, the presence or absence of the generation of reboil due to stirring was evaluated. The results are shown in Table 1. As is evident from Table, the examples of the present invention in which the amount of SO3 comprised in the raw material is not more than 150 ppm, or the SO3 amount in the glass is not more than 10 ppm, the reboil due to stirring was not generated. In addition, in the samples in which the SO3 amount in the glass is less than 5 ppm, bubble in a product was distinctly few. In comparison between Samples Nos. 4 and 6 and between Samples Nos. 10 and 12, in the samples in the SO3 amount in the glass is smaller, bubble in the product was few. Though the reboil is generated chiefly at the time of stirring, besides, it is also generated even slightly at an interface with the refractory or the like. It may be considered that when the SO3 amount in the glass is small, this reboil generated even slightly can be suppressed. For that reason, it is understood that if the SO3 amount in the glass can be controlled to less than 5 ppm, a glass with higher quality can be obtained. Incidentally, the SO3 amount in the glass is a value determined by dipping an analysis sample in Na2CO3 by means of alkali fusion and filtering with a filter paper, and subsequently stirring a filtrate thereof with an ion exchange resin and again filtering, followed by measuring by means of ion chromatography. The Cl amount, the SnO2 amount, and the CeO2 amount in the glass were each a value determined by subjecting a plate-shaped analysis sample to mirror polishing and measuring by a fluorescent X-ray analyzer. The presence or absence of the generation of reboil due to stirring was evaluated in the following manner. That is, a number of bubbles in each of a glass collected before stirring with the platinum stirrer and a glass after forming was calculated into a number of bubbles per kg. Then, in the case where the number of bubbles in the glass after forming was two times or more as compared with the number of bubbles in the glass before stirring, the reboil was evaluated to generate. Bubble in the product is one obtained by irradiating light from a side face of the plate-shaped sample, visually observing bubbles, and calculating them into a number of bubbles per kg. Subsequently, the crystallizable glass sample was put in an electric furnace and subjected to a heat treatment according to the following two schedules, respectively, thereby achieving crystallization, followed by furnace cooling. (1) Nucleation: 780° C. for 2 hours→Crystal growth: 900° C. for 3 hours (2) Nucleation: 780° C. for 2 hours→Crystal growth: 1,160° C. for 1 hour Incidentally, the rate of temperature rise from room temperature to the nucleation temperature was set to 300° C./h, and the rate of temperature rise from the nucleation temperature to the crystal growth temperature was set to from 100 to 200° C./h. Each of the obtained samples was evaluated with respect to the main crystal and appearance. In addition, the transparent crystallized glass sample produced according to the schedule (1) was further measured with respect to a β-OH value and a transmittance at 400 nm. As a result, in all of the samples, when the heat treatment was carried out according to the schedule (1), a transparent crystallized glass in which a β-quartz solid solution precipitated as a main crystal was obtained. When the heat treatment was carried out according to the schedule (2), a white opaque crystallized glass in which a β-spodumene solid solution precipitated as a main crystal was obtained. In addition, in Samples Nos. 4 and 5, each of which did not comprise CeO2 and comprised 3% or more of Li2O, a high transmittance was obtained. In addition, in Samples Nos. 9 to 12, as prepared in a range of 3.7≦Li2O+0.741MgO+0.367ZnO)≦4.5, nonetheless SnO2 was comprised, a high transmittance was obtained. Incidentally, the main crystal was evaluated using an X-ray diffraction apparatus. The appearance was visually observed. The β-OH value was measured with respect to a mirror polished plate-shaped sample in a thickness of 3 mm by using an infrared spectral photometer (Perkin Elmer Spectrum GX). The transmittance at 400 nm was measured with respect to a mirror polished plate-shaped sample in a thickness of 1.1 mm by using a spectral photometer (UV3100PC). Example 2 Table 2 shows examples of the present invention in which a n-OH value was adjusted in the presence of Cl (Samples Nos. 16 and 17) and comparative examples (Samples Nos. 13 to 15 and 18).

First of all, silica sand, alumina, lithium carbonate, barium nitrate, sodium nitrate, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and the like were compounded so as to have a composition comprising 67% of SiO2, 23% of Al2O3, 4% of Li2O, 1.5% of BaO, 0.5% of Na2O, 2% of TiO2, and 2% of ZrO2 in terms of a percentage by mass and to have a S amount shown in Table 2. Furthermore, a chloride (NaCl, KCl, BaCl2, and the like) was added in a chlorine proportion shown iohn Table 2, followed by uniformly mixing. Thereafter, this raw material batch was melted in a heating system and at a melting efficiency shown in Table 2. Incidentally, the Cl amount “<50 ppm” of Sample No. 13 in Table shows that the amount of Cl comprised as an impurity is less than 50 ppm. In addition, the term “electric” in Table means an electric melting system; the term “oxygen” means an oxygen combustion system; and the term describing the both means a combination of the both systems. In addition, the SO3 amount in the raw material is a value determined by dipping an analysis sample in Na2CO3 by means of alkali fusion and filtering with a filter paper, and subsequently stirring a filtrate thereof with an ion exchange resin and again filtering, followed by measuring by means of ion chromatography. Subsequently, the glass melt was stirred with a platinum stirrer and then roll formed in a thickness of 4 mm, followed by cooling to room temperature within an annealing furnace. Thereafter, the crystallizable glass sample obtained by cutting into a prescribed length was analyzed with respect to SO3 amount and Cl amount in the glass. In addition, the presence or absence of the generation of reboil due to stirring was evaluated. Incidentally, the SO3 amount in the glass is a value determined by dipping an analysis sample in Na2CO3 by means of alkali fusion and filtering with a filter paper, and subsequently stirring a filtrate thereof with an ion exchange resin and again filtering, followed by measuring by means of ion chromatography. The Cl amount in the glass was a value determined by subjecting a plate-shaped analysis sample to mirror polishing and measuring by a fluorescent X-ray analyzer. The presence or absence of the generation of reboil due to stirring was evaluated in the following manner. That is, a number of bubbles in each of a glass collected before stirring with the platinum stirrer and a glass after forming was calculated into a number of bubbles per kg. Then, in the case where the number of bubbles in the glass after forming was two times or more as compared with the number of bubbles in the glass collected before stirring, the reboil was evaluated to generate. Subsequently, the crystallizable glass sample was put in an electric furnace and subjected to a heat treatment according to a schedule of performing nucleation at 780° C. for 2 hours and crystal growth at 900° C. for 3 hours (schedule 1) thereby achieving crystallization, followed by furnace cooling. Each of the thus obtained samples was measured with respect to the β-OH value. In addition, each of the obtained samples was measured with respect to the main crystal and appearance. As a result, in all of the samples, a transparent crystallized glass in which a β-quartz solid solution precipitated as a main crystal was obtained. Furthermore, as is evident from Table 2, in Samples Nos. 16 and 17 in which the β-OH value or the S amount in the raw material was adjusted in such a manner that the S amount of the glass was not more than 10 ppm, the reboil was not generated. Incidentally, instead of the schedule 1, the heat treatment was carried out according to a schedule of performing nucleation at 780 ° C. for 2 hours and crystal growth at 1,160 ° C. for 1 hour (schedule 2). As a result, a white opaque crystallized glass in which a β-spodumene solid solution precipitated as a main crystal was obtained. Incidentally, the β-OH value was measured with respect to a mirror polished plate-shaped sample in a thickness of 3 mm by using an infrared spectral photometer (Perkin Elmer Spectrum GX). The main crystal was evaluated using an X-ray diffraction apparatus. The appearance was visually observed. In all of Schedules 1 and 2, the rate of temperature rise from room temperature to the nucleation temperature was set to 300° C./h, and the rate of temperature rise from the nucleation temperature to the crystal growth temperature was set to from 100 to 200° C./h. Example 3 The present invention is hereunder described by reference to the following examples and comparative example. Table 3 shows examples of the present invention (Samples Nos. 20 and 21) and a comparative example (Sample No. 19). TABLE 3 Sample No. 19 20 21 SO3 in raw material (ppm) 120 120 120 Grain size of SiO2 raw 10 60 90 material (μm) SO3 in glass (ppm) 16 9 7 Reboil Generated Not generated Not generated Each of the samples was prepared in the following manner. First of all, silica sand, alumina, lithium carbonate, barium nitrate, sodium nitrate, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and the like were compounded so as to have a composition comprising 67% of SiO2, 23% of Al2O3, 4% of Li2O, 1.5% of BaO, 0.5% of Na2O, 2% of TiO2, and 2% of ZrO2 in terms of a percentage by mass. Furthermore, NaCl was comprised in a proportion of 0.2% by mass as Cl, followed by uniformly mixing. At that time, each of raw materials having an average particle diameter shown in Table was used as the SiO2 raw material. Subsequently, this raw material batch was put into a refractory furnace (tank furnace for continuous production) by oxygen combustion and melted at a melting efficiency of 2.5 m2/(t/day). Subsequently, the glass melt was stirred with a platinum stirrer and then roll formed in a thickness of 4 mm, followed by cooling to room temperature within an annealing furnace. Thereafter, the crystallizable glass sample obtained by cutting into a prescribed length and measured with respect to the presence or absence of the generation of reboil. The results are shown in Table 3. As is evident from Table, in Nos. 20 and 21, the reboil due to stirring was not generated. Incidentally, the SO3 amount in each of the raw material and the glass is a value determined by dipping an analysis sample in Na2CO3 by means of alkali fusion and filtering with a filter paper, and subsequently stirring a filtrate thereof with an ion exchange resin and again filtering, followed by measuring by means of ion chromatography. The presence or absence of the generation of reboil was decided in the following manner. That is, a number of bubbles in each of a glass collected before stirring with the platinum stirrer and a glass after forming was calculated into a number of bubbles per kg. Then, in the case where the number of bubbles in the glass after forming was two times or more as compared with the number of bubbles in the glass before stirring, the reboil was evaluated to generate. Subsequently, the crystallizable glass sample was put in an electric furnace and subjected to a heat treatment according to the following two schedules, respectively, thereby achieving crystallization, followed by furnace cooling. (1) Nucleation: 780° C. for 2 hours→Crystal growth: 900° C. for 3 hours (2) Nucleation: 780° C. for 2 hours→Crystal growth: 1,160° C. for 1 hour Incidentally, the rate of temperature rise from room temperature to the nucleation temperature was set to 300° C./h, and the rate of temperature rise from the nucleation temperature to the crystal growth temperature was set to from 100 to 200° C./h. Each of the obtained samples was evaluated with respect to the main crystal and appearance. As a result, in all of the samples, when the heat treatment was carried out according to the schedule (1), a transparent crystallized glass in which a β-quartz solid solution precipitated as a main crystal was obtained. When the heat treatment was carried out according to the schedule (2), a white opaque crystallized glass in which a β-spodumene solid solution precipitated as a main crystal was obtained. Incidentally, the main crystal was evaluated using an X-ray diffraction apparatus. The appearance was visually observed.
