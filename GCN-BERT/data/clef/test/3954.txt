Step 1: Preparation of methyl 2-chloro-6-(4-methoxyphenoxy) nicotinate
A 250 mL eggplant flask was sequentially charged with methyl 2,6-dichloronicotinate (3.09 g, 15 mmol), 4-methoxyphenol (1.86 g, 15mmol), and 18 mL of N, N-dimethylformamide for dissolving them. Triethylamine (2.7 ml, 19.5 mmol) was added dropwise under stirring at room temperature, and after completion of the dropwise addition, triethylene diamine (252 mg, 2.25 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4-5 hours and the solution changed from clear to turbid. Thin layer chromatography [V (petroleum ether) / V (ethyl acetate) = 6/1] detected that most of the raw material disappeared. Then, 1.30 mL of HOAc, 25 mL of isopropanol and 15 mL of ice water were sequentially added while the solution changed from turbid to clear, and stirred at room temperature for 0.5 hour. 40 mL of water was slowly dropwise added, and after completion of the dropwise addition, stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. A large number of white solid precipitated and was filtered. The filter cake was washed with a mixed solution of isopropyl alcohol / water = 1: 1 and dried under vacuum at 50 Â°C for 8 hours to obtain 4.05 g of methyl 2-chloro-6-(4-methoxyphenoxy) nicotinate as a solid, 91.84%.
