No. 61/782,119, filed Mar. 14, 2013, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT This invention was made with government support under EB013042 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The regioselective fluorination of organic compounds is an important challenge in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals (see, for example, Muller et al., Science 2007, 317, 1881-1886; Park et al., Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology 2001, 41, 443-470; Bohm et al., ChemBioChem 2004, 5, 637-643; and Jeschke, ChemBioChem. 2004, 5, 570-589). Syntheses of simple fluoroarenes currently rely on the pyrolysis of diazonium tetrafluoroborates (Balz, G.; Schiemann, G. Ber. Deut. Chem. Ges. 1927, 60, 1186-1190), direct fluorination using highly reactive, elemental fluorine (Sandford, J. Fluorine Chem. 2007, 128, 90-104), or nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions of electron-poor aromatic systems by displacement of other halogens or nitro groups (Sun et al., Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2006, 45, 2720-2725; Adams et al., Chem. Soc. Rev. 1999, 28, 225-231). The reductive elimination of arylfluorides from palladium(II) fluoride complexes is an attractive potential alternative that has been investigated by Grushin (Grushin, Chem.-Eur. J. 2002, 8, 1006-1014) over the past decade and more recently by Yandulov. A single substrate—p-fluoronitrobenzene—has been prepared successfully in 10% yield in the Yandulov study from a stoichiometric palladium fluoride complex (Yandulov et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 1342-1358) (See also Watson et al., Science, 2009, Vol. 325. No. 5948, pp. 1661-1664). Directed electrophilic fluorination of phenylpyridine derivatives and related structures using catalytic palladium(II) acetate and N-fluoropyridinium salts has been reported by Sanford in 2006 (Hull et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 7134-7135). Taking advantage of the directing effect of a pyridine substituent, proximal carbon-hydrogen bonds can be fluorinated using microwave irradiation at high temperatures (100-150° C., 1-4 h, 33-75% yield). The use of 18F-labelled organic compounds for positron-emission tomography (PET) requires the controlled, efficient introduction of fluorine into functionalized molecules (see, for example, Couturier et al., Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging 2004, 31, 1182-1206; Lasne et al., “Chemistry of beta(+)-emitting compounds based on fluorine-18” In Contrast Agents II, 2002; Vol. 222, pp 201-258; and Phelps, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000, 97, 9226-9233). PET has been used to measure presynaptic accumulation of 18F-fluorodopa tracer in the dopaminergic regions of the brain (see, for example, Ernst et al., “Presynaptic Dopaminergic Deficits in Lesch-Nyhan Disease” New England Journal of Medicine (1996) 334:1568-1572), but fluorination of other organic compounds has been difficult due to lack of an appropriate fluorination method. Despite the utility of fluorinated organic compounds in multiple pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and agrochemical applications, C—F bond formation remains a challenging organic transformation with no broadly applicable solutions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides novel nickel complexes and methods of using these complexes in the fluorination of organic compounds. The inventive system is also particularly useful in preparing 18F-labeled compounds for PET imaging. The inventive system relies on utilizing a fluorine source (e.g., a nucleophilic fluorine source) such as a commercially available fluorinating reagent (e.g., tetrabutylammonium difluorophenylsilicate (TBAT)) or a fluoride source comprising water (e.g., containing 18F which can be produced using a cyclotron). In one aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of producing a fluorinated organic compound, the method comprising mixing a nickel comprising complex with a flourine source under conditions sufficient to fluorinate the organic compound, thereby providing a fluorinated organic compound. In some embodiments, the fluorine source is a fluoride source comprising water (e.g., a fluoride source in a mixture is water and acetonitrile). In some embodiments, the fluoride source contains 18F fluoride. In some embodiments, the fluoride source is produced using a cyclotron. In some embodiments, the fluoride source is produced using a cyclotron in 18O enriched water. In some embodiments, the method further comprises an oxidant (e.g., when the fluorinating agent is nucleophilic). In some embodiments, the fluorinating agent is a nucleophilic fluorinating agent. In some embodiments, the nucleophilic fluorinating agent is sodium fluoride (NaF), silver fluoride (AgF), tetrabutylammonium fluoride (NH4F), substituted tetrabutylammonium fluoride (NR4F), cesium fluoride (CsF), potassium fluoride (KF), tetrabutylammonium difluorotriphenylsilicate (TBAT) and XeF2. In some embodiments, the nucleophilic fluorinating agent comprises 18F or 19F. In some embodiments, the method is carried out in the absence of an oxidant (e.g., when the fluorinating agent is electrophilic). In some embodiments, the fluorinating agent is an electrophilic fluorinating agent. In some embodiments, the fluorinating agent is selected from the group consisting of N-fluoropyridinium triflate, N-fluoro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium triflate, N-fluoro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate, N-fluoro-2,6-dichloropyridinium tetrafluoroborate, N-fluoro-2,6-dichloropyridinium triflate, N-fluoropyridinium pyridine heptafluorodiborate, N-fluoropyridinium tetrafluoroborate, an N-fluoroarylsulfonimide (e.g., N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide), N-chloromethyl-N′-fluorotriethylenediammonium bis(tetrafluoroborate) (SELECTFLUOR®), N-chloromethyl-N′-fluorotriethylenediammonium bis(hexafluorophosphate) and N-chloromethyl-N′-fluorotriethylenediammonium bis(triflate). In some embodiments, the electrophilic fluorinating agent comprises 18F or 19F. In some embodiments, the reaction further comprises a metal chelator. In some embodiments, the stabilizer is a crown ether (e.g., 18-crown-6). In certain embodiments, the molar ratio of fluorinating agent to nickel comprising complex is 10:1 or lower (e.g., 9:1, 8:1, 7:1, 6:1, 5:1, 4:1, 3:1, 2.5:1, 2:1, 1.5:1 or 1:1).

In certain embodiments, the ratio of 18F-fluorine source to nickel comprising complex is 1:10 or lower (e.g., 1:11, 1:100, 1:1,000, 1:10,000, 1:100,000 or 1:1,000,000).

The fluoride source may contain a particular isotope of fluorine (e.g., 18F). In some embodiments, the fluoride source contains 18F fluoride (i.e., transfers an 18F fluorine substituent to the organic compound). In certain embodiments, reaction of the 18F fluoride source in the inventive process provides a fluorinated 18F-labeled organic compound. In some embodiments, the fluoride source comprising water (e.g., the aqueous fluoride source contains 18F) is produced using a cyclotron. In some embodiments, the fluoride source comprising water is produced using a cyclotron in 18O enriched water. In certain embodiments, the source of fluorine is a fluorinating agent.

In certain embodiments, the substrate, after fluorination, is biologically active. In certain embodiments, the substrate, prior to fluorinated, is also biologically active. In certain embodiments, the process provides after fluorination of the substrate a known biologically active fluorinated compound, such as a fluorinated agrochemical or fluorinated pharmaceutical agent. For example, in certain embodiments, the process provides after fluorination, the following compounds: Exemplary Reaction Conditions Described herein are compositions comprising a nickel complex described herein, including a reaction mixture, e.g., a reaction mixture that is present during a method or process described herein. As defined generally herein, in certain embodiments, the process comprises mixing a nickel comprising complex described herein and a substrate with a fluorinating agent and an oxidant (e.g., a compound of formula (IX)) under conditions sufficient to fluorinate the substrate to thereby provide a fluorinated organic compound. In certain embodiments, the nickel complex can be bound to a solid support. In certain embodiments, the method further comprises a solvent. In certain embodiments, the solvent is an organic solvent. In certain embodiments, the solvent is an aprotic solvent. Exemplary organic solvents include, but are not limited to, benzene, toluene, xylenes, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetonitrile, acetone, ethyl acetate, ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, dichloroethane and chloroform, or a mixture thereof. In certain embodiments, the solvent is acetonitrile. In certain embodiments, the solvent is acetonitrile. In certain embodiments, the reaction further comprises heating. In certain embodiments, the reaction further comprises cooling (e.g., to 0° C. or lower). In certain embodiments, the reaction takes place under an inert atmosphere (e.g., an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon). In certain embodiments, the reaction takes place under anhydrous conditions (e.g., conditions that are substantially free of water). Methods Described herein are methods for fluorination of organic compounds. In certain embodiments, the fluorination reaction is regiospecific. Introduction of fluorine into a certain position of bioactive compound such as a pharmaceutical agent and an agricultural chemical may remarkably reduce the toxicity of the compound. This is due to the mimic and blocking effect characterized by fluorine. Organofluorine compounds are emerging as chemical specialties of significant and increasing commercial interest. A major driver has been the development of fluorine-containing bio-active molecules for use as medicinal and plant-protection agents. Other new applications involving organofluorine chemistry are in the synthesis of liquid crystals, surface active agents, specialty coatings, reactive dyes, and even olefin polymerization catalysts. 19F-fluorinated organic compounds may be useful for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology. MRI is a primarily a medical imaging technique most commonly used in radiology to visualize the structure and function of the body. It provides detailed images of the body in any plane. MRI contrast agents are a group of contrast media used to improve the visibility of internal body structures in MRI. Contrast agents alter the relaxation times of tissues and body cavities where they are present, which depending on the image weighting can give a higher or lower signal. Fluorine-containing contrast agents may be especially useful due to the lack of fluorine chemistry in the human body. This could, for example provide a detailed view of acidic regions, such as those containing cancer cells. 19F-labeled MRI contrast agents may add chemical sensitivity to MRI and could be used to track disease progression without the need to take tissue or fluid samples. 19F-fluorinated organic compounds may also be useful as probes for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Fluorine has many advantages as a probe for NMR spectroscopy of biopolymers. 19F has a spin of one-half, and its high gyromagnetic ratio contributes to its high sensitivity (approximately 83% of the sensitivity of 1H). It also facilitates long-range distance measurements through dipolar-dipolar coupling. Moreover, the near-nonexistence of fluorine atoms in biological systems enables 19F NMR studies without background signal interference. Furthermore, the chemical shift of 19F has been shown to be very sensitive to its environment. 18F-fluorinated organic compounds are particularly useful for positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging technology. PET is a noninvasive imaging technology that is currently used in the clinic to image cancers and neurological disorders at an early stage of illness. PET tracers are molecules which incorporate a PET-active nucleus and can therefore be visualized by their positron emission in the body. The fluorine isotope 18F is the most common nucleus for PET imaging because of its superior properties to other nuclei. The 18F radioisotope has a half-life of 109 minutes. The short half-life dictates restrictions on chemical synthesis of PET tracers, because introduction of the fluorine atom has to take place at a very late stage of the synthesis to avoid the unproductive decay of 18F before it is injected into the body. Fluoride ion is the most common reagent to introduce 18F but the specific chemical properties of the fluoride ion currently limit the available pool of PET tracers. Due to the narrow functional group compatibility of the strongly basic fluoride ion, only a limited set of chemical reactions can be employed for fluorination, and hence the synthesis of PET tracers is limited to fairly simple molecules such as FDG. The field of PET imaging would benefit from the availability of a new method that is capable of introducing radiolabeled fluoride into structurally more complex organic molecules. An easy access to drug-based PET tracers would simplify determining the fate of such drugs in the body and thereby help to identify and understand their mode of action, bioavailability and time-dependent biodistribution.

Example 4 Synthesis of Nickel 2-Nitro-N-(2-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)benzenesulfonamide Complex (1x) A 250 ml, 2-neck, glass round-bottomed flask equipped with a teflon stirbar, adapter to a nitrogen line, and a plastic cap, was evacuated under vacuum, flame-dried, and refilled with nitrogen. Nickel acetate tetrahydrate (0.280 g, 1.23 mmol) was added, and the flask was evacuated under vacuum and backfilled with nitrogen. Distilled pyridine (16 ml) was added and the resulting dark blue solution was stirred. 2-Nitro-N-(2-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)benzenesulfonamide (0.400 g, 1.13 mmol) was dissolved in distilled pyridine (10 ml), and the resulting solution was added dropwise to the reaction via syringe, followed by a pyridine wash (1×2 ml). The mixture became a greenish-blue, homogeneous solution. In a glovebox, potassium tert-butoxide (0.253 g, 2.26 mmol) was weighed into a 20 ml glass vial, a septum affixed with tape, and removed from the glovebox. Distilled pyridine (7 ml) was added to obtain a homogeneous solution. The solution was added to the nickel reaction mixture dropwise via syringe followed by a pyridine wash (1×1 ml). The mixture became greenish-yellow, and a colorless precipitate formed. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature, and the mixture was concentrated in vacuo (50° C. waterbath). The crude green-orange residue was dried in vacuo over 12 h. To the crude solid was added 10 ml THF, and the solution was filtered through Celite. The flask was rinsed (2×3 ml THF) and transferred to the filter pad successively. A turbid green solution was obtained. This solution was filtered through a second pad of Celite, rinsing with THF (1×2 ml) to obtain a homogeneous green solution. Water (0.1 ml) was added with vigorous stirring, effecting precipitation of a large amount of turquoise solid and a yellow supernatant. Additional water (0.4 ml) was added with stirring, and the entire mixture was transferred to a 20 ml glass vial with a THF wash (1×1 ml). The mixture was centrifuged, and the yellow supernatant was decanted leaving a turquoise solid. THF (6 ml) was added, the solution was mixed and centrifuged, and the colorless supernatant decanted. The process was repeated once further, and the remaining turquoise solid was dried in vacuo to afford a crude turquoise powder. The powder was suspended in dichoromethane (30 ml) in a 50 ml round-bottom flask, which was sealed and heated at 40 OC for 5 min, then filtered through Celite, affording a homogenous green filtrate that was allowed to stand at ambient temperature overnight. The mixture was filtered through Celite to afford a homogeneous green filtrate. Hexanes (12 ml) was added dropwise to the mixture with vigorous stirring. After several minutes, a green precipitate formed. The flask was sealed and placed in a freezer for 8 h, following which time the mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant decanted. The remaining solid was treated with pentane (10 ml), and the mixture was centrifuged, and the pentane decanted to yield the title compound 1x as a green powder (175 mg, 35%). Alternative Synthesis of Nickel 2-Nitro-N-(2-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)benzenesulfonamide Complex (1x) To a 4 ml glass vial was added nickel acetate tetrahydrate (35 mg, 0.14 mmol), a Teflon stirbar, and distilled pyridine (1.4 ml). The vial was capped and the solution stirred vigorously to afford a blue solution. A solution of 2-nitro-N-(2-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)benzenesulfonamide (0.050 g, 0.14 mmol) in distilled pyridine (1.4 ml) was added to the reaction mixture dropwise. The resulting dark green-blue solution was stirred for 5 min, whereupon aqueous sodium hydroxide (2.55 M, 0.110 ml) was added dropwise. The mixture was sonicated briefly, leading to a yellow-green solution. Following 20 min, the solution was transferred to a 20 ml glass vial, and pentane (16 ml) was added dropwise with stirring, resulting in a biphasic system. The pentane layer was decanted, and ether (18 ml) was added. The mixture was stirred vigorously, leading to precipitation of a yellow solid. The mixture was centrifuged, the supernatant decanted, and the resulting residue was dried in vacuo. Minimal dicholoromethane was added to the residue, leading to the production of a quantity of orange solid. The mixture was filtered through Celite, affording a green solution that was concentrated in vacuo to afford the product 1x as a green solid (15.6 mg, 6%). An NMR sample was allowed to stand at ambient temperature for 2 days, during which time large green crystals grew. One of these crystals was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (see FIG. 5). Example 5 Direct Insertion of Nickel 2-Nitro-N-(2-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)benzenesulfonamide Complex into 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-1H-indol-5-yl Boronic Acid to Produce 1c To a 20 mL glass vial equipped with a teflon stirbar was added 2,2′-bipyridine (12 mg, 0.077 mmol), 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-1H-indol-5-yl boronic acid (0.020 g, 0.077 mmol), and the nickel complex 1x (34 mg, 0.019 mmol). Dry pyridine (3.1 ml) was added, and the reaction vial was purged with nitrogen and sealed with a cap. The solution was stirred to afford a green mixture with white suspended solid. The reaction was heated to 70° C. in an oil bath. Following 30 min, the mixture was cooled to room temperature. The resulting orange solution was concentrated in vacuo to give a brown residue. The solid was triturated with pentane (5×5 ml) and dried in vacuo. The solid was dissolved in dichloromethane, filtered through Celite, reduced in volume to approximately 1 ml in vacuo, following which pentane (15 ml) was added dropwise to the stirred mixture leading to formation of a yellow precipitate. The vial was centrifuged, and the organic layer was decanted. The residual yellow solid was sonicated with pentane (10 ml), centrifuged, the organic layer was decanted, and the process repeated a second time. The residual yellow solid was dried in vacuo to yield the product 1c as a yellow solid (52.0 mg, 96%). Example 6 Radiochemistry General Methods No-carrier-added [18F]fluoride was produced from water 97% enriched in 18O (Sigma-Aldrich®) by the nuclear reaction 18O (p,n)18F using a Siemens Eclipse HP cyclotron and a silver-bodied target at MGH Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. The produced [18F]fluoride in water was transferred from the cyclotron target by helium push. Liquid chromatographic analysis (LC) was performed with Agilent 1100 series HPLCs connected to a Carol and Ramsey Associates Model 105-S radioactivity detector. An Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18, 5 μm, 4.6×150 mm HPLC column was used for analytical analysis and a Waters Bondapak™ C18, 10 m, 125 Å, 7.6×300 mm HPLC was used for preparative HPLC. Analytical HPLC used the following mobile phases: 0.1% CF3CO2H in water (A) 0.1% CF3CO2H in acetonitrile (B). Program: 50% (B) for 2 minutes then a gradient 50-95% (B) over 8 minutes. Preparative HPLC used the following mobile phases: 0.1% CF3CO2H in water (A) 0.1% CF3CO2H in acetonitrile (B). Program: 40% (B). In the analysis of the 18F-labeled compounds, isotopically unmodified reference substances were used for identification. Radioactivity was measured in a Capintec, Inc. CRC-25PET ion chamber. Solvents and reagents for radiochemical experiments: Acetonitrile was distilled over P2O5. Water was obtained from a Millipore Milli-Q Integral Water Purification System. 18-crown-6 was sublimed. Radiosynthesis of 18F-Labeled Molecules A portion of aqueous [18F]fluoride solution (20-50 μL, 2-5 mCi) obtained from a cyclotron was added to an acetonitrile solution (2.0-5.0 mL) which contained 20 mg of 18-cr-6. The acetonitrile solution (200-500 μl) was added quickly via the septum to the vial (4 mL) that contained 1.0 mg nickel complex 1 and 1.0 equiv of 6 (compared to 1). The solution became immediately pink or red or yellow depending on nickel complexes and then became colorless within 5 to 10 seconds. A capillary tube was then used to spot the solution on a silica gel TLC plate. The TLC plate was emerged in an appropriate organic solvent mixture. The TLC plate was scanned with a Bioscan AR-2000 Radio TLC Imaging Scanner. Results are shown on Table S1 (See also FIG. 3). Effect of Additives on the Radiosynthesis of 18F-Labeled Molecules A portion of aqueous [18F]fluoride solution (as specified on Table S2) obtained from a cyclotron was added to an acetonitrile solution (0.5 mL) which contained 1 mg of 18-cr-6. To this solution was added a portion of saturated aqueous solution of a salt (as specified on Table S2), and the resulting solution was added quickly to a septum-capped vial containing 1.0 mg nickel complex 1 and 1.0 equiv of 6 (compared to 1). The solution became immediately pink or red or yellow depending on nickel complexes and then became colorless within 5 to 10 seconds. A capillary tube was then used to spot the solution on a silica gel TLC plate. The TLC plate was emerged in an appropriate organic solvent mixture. The TLC plate was scanned with a Bioscan AR-2000 Radio TLC Imaging Scanner. As shown on Table S2, a number of inorganic additives led to an increase in radiochemical yield. Most notably, K3PO4 doubled the radiochemical yield for the fluorination of an indole nickel complex. Measurement of Radiochemical Yield Radiochemical yield was determined by multiplying the percentage of radioactivity in the solution and the relative peak integrations of a radio TLC scan. After spotting the solution on a silica gel TLC plate, the remaining solution was transferred to the other vial. The radioactivity of the solution was measured in an ion chamber and the amount of radioactivity left on the walls of the initial vial was measured. After radio TLC quantification, the radiochemical yield was determined by multiplying the product quantified during TLC by the fraction of radioactivity in solution (typically 70-85%, see also FIG. 4).
