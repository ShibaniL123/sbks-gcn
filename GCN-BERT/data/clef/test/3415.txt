By the aforesaid structure, the playing cards can be conducted out stably one by one, so the game process can be smooth and quick to save time. The details of the present invention are described hereinafter. As shown in FIG. 1 to FIG. 4, the present invention is placed in a game system and controlled by the command of the system. The card case 50 is first disengaged from the base 20 for placing Joker playing cards 1 therein, and then coupled to the base 20 to proceed with dealing. The inclination of the bottom board 51 makes the Joker playing cards 1 slide toward the rear board of the card case 50 subject to gravity, so that the stack of Joker playing cards 1 won't topple over easily. The curved surface of the guide block 22 guides the Joker playing cards 1 which are sent obliquely through the first, second and third guide wheels 31, 32, 33 to the position between the fourth guide wheel 34 and the upper press wheel 35 in a horizontal direction for the Joker playing cards 1 to be pulled out stably and quickly. Referring to FIG. 4 and FIG. 5, the side of the base 20 has a first lock hole 13 and a first curved groove 13. One side of the speed changing box 12 is pivotally connected to the first lock hole 13 and another side of the speed changing box 12 is locked to the first curved groove 14, such that the speed changing box 13 can be pivoted about the first lock hole 13 to adjust the tightness of the first drive belt 400a. The side of the base 20 further has a second lock hole 15 and a second curved groove 16. One side of the second drive motor 11 is pivotally connected to the second lock hole 15 and another side of the second drive motor 11 is locked to the second curved groove 16, such that the second drive motor 11 can be pivoted about the second lock hole 15 to adjust the tightness of the second drive belt 400b. Referring to FIG. 6 to FIG. 9, when the game system is about to deal, the Joker playing cards 1 which have been shuffled are placed into the card case 50, and then the card case 50 is coupled to the base 20. The first and second guide wheels 31, 32 respectively pass through the first and second openings 52, 54 to contact with the Joker playing cards 1. This moment, the video camera 24 is to identify and record the pattern and numeric of the first Joker playing card 1 through the identification hole 53, and the first and second drive motors 10, 11 are started simultaneously. The first drive motor 10 drives the first, second and third guide wheels 31, 32, 33 to turn slowly through the speed changing box 12. The second drive motor 11 drives the fourth guide wheels 34 to turn quickly. The Joker playing card 1 is pushed forward by the first and second guide wheels 31, 32 to pass through the third guide wheel 33 and to lean against the guide block 22, as shown in FIG. 6. At this time, the video camera 24 is to identify and record the pattern and numeric of the second Joker playing card 1 through the identification hole 53, and then the Joker playing card 1 is pushed forward by the turning friction of the first, second and third guide wheels 31, 32, 33, such that the Joker playing card 1 is moved forward in the horizontal direction along with the curved surface of the guide block 22, as shown in FIG. 7, to pass above the interruption sense device 26. This enables the game system to sense pass of the Joker playing card 1. The first Joker playing card 1 continues to move forward to be gradually away from the first guide wheel 31, and the first guide wheel 32 is in contact with the second Joker playing card 1 to be moved forward until the second Joker playing card 1 is stopped by the guide block 22, as shown in FIG. 8. Because the second Joker playing card 2 is only subject to the turning friction of the first guide wheel 31, its advance force is less. Further, the first Joker playing card 1 is pushed to a slightly high position to lean against the guide block 22. The second Joker playing card 1 doesn't have enough propulsive force to bend and pass between the guide block 22 and the third guide wheel 33, so it is stopped and cannot move forward. At this time, the video camera 24 is to identify and record the pattern and numeric of the third Joker playing card 1 through the identification hole 53. When the first Joker playing card 1 enters between the fourth guide wheel 34 and the upper press wheel 35, it will be pulled out quickly. And, the interruption sense device 26 is not interrupted to complete the count and to notify the first drive motor 10 of stopping turning. After the first Joker playing card 1 is fully away from the fourth guide wheel 34 and the upper press wheel 35, the game system completes the deal of the first Joker playing card 1. Through the aforesaid structure, the playing cards can be conducted out stably one by one, so the game process is smooth and quick to save time. Through the foregoing structure, the present invention provides a device to print, output, and recycle the playing cards of the electronic automation playing card game system for the players to get and squint at the playing cards like a real poker.
