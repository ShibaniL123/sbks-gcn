Intermediate 1. tert-Butyl 3,5-difluoro-4-(3-iodo-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)benzyl(methyl)carbamate
Step 1. tert-Butyl 3,5-difluorobenzyl(methyl)carbamate
To a solution of 3,5-difluorobenzaldehyde (15.0 g, 106 mmol) in MeOH (528 ml) was added methylamine (79.0 ml, 158 mmol, 2M in THF), and the reaction mixture was stirred at r.t. for 1 hour. Sodium borohydride (7.99 g, 211 mmol) was added and the reaction was stirred until bubbling has stopped. The mixture was concentrated to dryness, and then dissolved in 300 mL of DCM. Sodium bicarbonate aq. solution was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at r.t. for another 1 hour. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in DCM (528 ml), then DIPEA (18.4 ml, 106 mmol) and di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (24.5 ml, 106 mmol) were added. The resulting solution was stirred at r.t. for 1 hour. The solution was concentrated to dryness and the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography using 0-70% ethyl acetate in hexanes to afford desired product as colorless oil (15.1g, 55.4%).
