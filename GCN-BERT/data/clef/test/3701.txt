The present invention relates to a sofa. As is known, sometimes in homes the need is felt to change the arrangement of furniture or the type of furniture, and also to add a bed temporarily by modifying a sofa bed that is studied specifically for this purpose. Such changes are often made difficult by the geometry of the furniture. For example, if a room is furnished with a sofa of the L-shaped type or with a corner sofa, which is capable of performing the dual function of a chaise-longue and of a normal bench, these sofas, in addition to having a spatial configuration that is scarcely adaptable and therefore difficult to arrange in a new region or according to a new orientation, often are not designed to be converted into beds or, if they are, the modification into a bed requires a series of operations to extract the mattress from the structure of the sofa. Currently, sofas with a variable configuration are also known which can be adapted to different furnishing positions and can be changed rapidly and easily from sofas to beds and vice versa. Such a type of sofa comprises two supporting frames for a first seat and a second seat, which are hinged along a vertical axis, in order to rotate one with respect to the other from a first layout, in which the two seats are contiguous and correspond to a nil rotation angle, to a second layout, in which the two seats are mutually angled. This solution allows to vary the configuration of the sofa from an open position as a linear sofa to an intermediate position as an L-shaped sofa and from this position to a closed sofa bed position. However, this solution does not meet the requirement of combining in a single sofa the function of a chaise-longue with the function of a normal bench sofa and with the possibility to convert it into a bed. The aim of the present invention is to devise a sofa model that can be used both as a chaise-longue and as a normal bench sofa and at the same time can be modified easily into a bed. Within this aim, an object of the invention is to devise a sofa model that can be adapted easily to various arrangements of the furniture. This aim and these and other objects that will become better apparent hereinafter are achieved by a sofa, characterized in that it comprises a first supporting frame for a chaise-longue portion and a second supporting frame for a bench portion, which are hinged by way of hinge means with a vertical axis, adapted to allow a rotation from a first layout, in which said chaise-longue portion and said bench portion are contiguous, for a nil relative rotation angle, and define for said sofa a wave-like front curvature, to a second layout, in which said chaise-longue portion and said bench portion are mutually angled up to a straight rotation angle, for which they are coupled frontally with a constant sum of their respective depths. Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become better apparent from the description of a sofa according to the invention, illustrated by way of nonlimiting example in the accompanying drawings, wherein: Figure 1 is a perspective view of the sofa according to the invention in the first layout;Figure 2 is a perspective view of the sofa according to the invention in a second layout;Figure 3 is a schematic top view of the sofa according to the invention in the first layout and showing in broken lines two possible configurations related to the second layout;Figure 4 is a perspective view of the sofa according to the invention in another second layout. With reference to the figures, the sofa according to the invention, designated generally by the reference numeral 10, comprises a first supporting frame 11 for a chaise-longue portion 12 and a second supporting frame 13 for a bench portion 14. The two frames, the first one 11 and the second one 13, with the respective portions, the chaise-longue portion 12 and the bench portion 14, constitute substantially two sofa bodies, which are difficult to distinguish in Figure 1, in which they are arranged side by side, but are clearly identifiable in the subsequent Figures 2 and 3, which allow to see that they are hinged, by way of appropriate hinge means with a vertical axis 15, which are adapted to allow their relative rotation. The rotation in fact allows to modify the configuration of the sofa 10 by means of a rotation from a first layout A, shown in Figure 1, to a second layout B, which is shown in its possible variations in the subsequent figures. According to the first layout A, the chaise-longue portion 12 and the bench portion 14 are contiguous, since they are arranged according to a nil relative rotation angle and define for the sofa 10 in this first layout A a wave-like front curvature. In the second layout B, the chaise-longue portion 12 and the bench portion 14 are instead mutually angled by a rotation angle C, shown in Figure 3, which is greater than the nil angle and smaller than or equal to a straight angle. In particular, Figure 3 shows in a top view the sofa in the first layout A and in broken lines in the two second layouts B, the same ones shown in perspective view in Figure 2 and in Figure 4. As shown clearly in Figure 3 and Figure 4, the two portions, the chaise-longue portion 12 and the bench portion 14, can be rotated with respect to each other up to a straight rotation angle, for which they are frontally coupled, with a constant sum of the respective depths of the two portions. The sofa 10 is provided conveniently with means for locking rotation, not shown for the sake of simplicity, which are adapted to keep the two portions in the preferred layout and are optionally capable of engaging them in the configurations with a nil rotation angle and with a rotation angle equal to 180°. The hinge means with vertical axis 15 are arranged at the front end of a first side 16 and at a contiguous second side 17, respectively, of the first frame 11 and of the second frame 13, and consist substantially of a hinge 18 this is defined by the coupling of the ends of two arms that protrude respectively from the first side 16 and from the second side 17. Either the first frame 11 or the second frame 13 rests advantageously on the ground by way of ground gliding means 19. In particular, according to what is shown, the second frame 13 of the two is provided with said means, which are adapted to facilitate rotation with respect to the other frame. More particularly, the ground gliding means 19 consist of casters, four in the illustrated example, which also support the sofa body as a replacement of simple legs 20, such as those of the second frame 13. Some of the casters are indicated and visible in Figure 1 and Figure 4, as ground gliding means 19. The configurations that the sofa 10 can assume are a function of the angular position that the bench portion 14 can assume with respect to the chaise-longue portion 12. The position of the bench portion 14 in the second layout B of the sofa 10, shown in Figure 2, is intermediate with respect to the position of Figure 4, where, as a consequence of a rotation equal to a straight angle, they are coupled frontally and the sofa 10 is closed onto itself and can be used as a double bed. By viewing Figures 3 and 4 it can be seen that the sum of the depths of the two portions, the chaise-longue portion 12 and the bench portion 14, is constant. The two portions, in fact, as a consequence of the 180° rotation, are exactly complementary and the front side of one is shaped exactly complementarily to the front side of the other. Use of the sofa according to the invention is evident from what has been described and illustrated and in particular it is evident that the configuration of the sofa 10, of the corner type, can be modified easily and quickly from a first layout A, in which the sofa 10 is substantially linear and can be used as a chaise-longue or as a normal bench sofa, to a second layout B, according to which the two parts of the sofa 10 are mutually angled, optionally up to 180°, producing the conversion of the sofa into a bed. In practice it has been found that the invention achieves the intended aim and objects, by providing a sofa model that can be used as a chaise-longue in its chaise-longue portion, as a normal bench sofa and also as a bed as a result of simple and quick operations. Furthermore, the sofa can be adapted easily to different arrangements of the furniture since it can also be used in an L-shaped configuration, according to which its two portions are rotated through a right angle with respect to each other. In practice, the materials used, so long as they are compatible with the specific use, as well as the contingent shapes and dimensions, may be any according to requirements and to the state of the art.
