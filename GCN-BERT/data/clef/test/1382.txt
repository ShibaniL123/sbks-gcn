Step 2. 5-Chloro-3-iodo-1-{[2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]methyl}-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine
NaH in mineral oil (150 mg, 3.8 mmol) was slowly added at 0° C. to a solution of 5-chloro-3-iodo-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine (964 mg, 3.44 mmol) and [β-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]methyl chloride (639 μL, 3.61 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL). After stirring at r.t. for 1 h, the reaction mixture was quenched by the addition of water and the resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with brine and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure and the crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (1.2 g, 88%).
