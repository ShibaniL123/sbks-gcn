NUTRITIVE PRODUCT WITH ANIMAL ENSILAGE AND METHOD FOR MAKING THE NUTRITIVE PRODUCT The invention relates to the use of aqueous animal ensilage, especially fish ensilage, as a raw material in the production of a nutritive product. More particularly, the invention relates to a mixture comprising aqueous animal ensilage and a vegetable material. The mixture is cooking-extruded and the extrudate can be used as an intermediate product for the production of an animal feed. The extrudate can also be used directly as an animal feed. Fish ensilage is fish material that has been acidified to increase its storage stability. The fish material may be cuttings or whole fish. The fish material is mixed together and minced so that a homogenous mass is obtained. The homogenous mass is then acidified to approximately pH 3.0-4.5 by acid being added, for example an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, or an organic acid such as formic acid. The optimum pH value depends on the type of acid used. Through acidification, an inhibition of bacterial growth is achieved. The fish tissue is hydrolyzed by the fish's own enzymes. To accelerate the hydrolysis, the temperature may be increased . The temperature during ensilaging typically lies in the range from 5 °C to an upper limit of about 40 °C. The viscosity of the ensilage decreases with increasing temperature. It is desirable for the ensilage to be of low viscosity because it is then easier to pump. During ensilaging there will be a partial breakdown of important amino acids. It may therefore be beneficial to mix ensilage together with other protein sources to have a desired amino-acid profile. Fish ensilage is used for, among other things, the production of feeds for domestic animals, such as piglets and poultry, feeds for fur animals, such as foxes or minks, and feeds for pets. Ensilage of white fish may be used to produce feeds for salmo- noids. Ensilage of salmonoids is not used to produce feed for salmonoids as there is a possibility that fish-pathogenic bacteria and fish-pathogenic viruses that have not been killed in the ensilaging process and while the ensilage has been stored may cause disease. Infections like that are not transferred to domestic animals and fur animals. A problem in the commercial utilization of fish ensilage is the physical form of the ensilage. Compared with fish meal, which is dry, fish ensilage is liquid and has a high water content. To be able to utilize the fish ensilage to produce feeds, there is therefore a need for additives which have the ability to bind the moisture present. By binding the moisture, the resulting material can be used further for the production of solid feed products, for example through an extrusion process. It is also desirable to have an additive which has a nutritional value in itself. Particularly desirable are additives that have an amino-acid profile complementary to the protein of the ensilage, so that a feed with a good bioaccessibility of the protein present in the feed is obtained. It is also known to heat ensilage, separate oil from the ensilage and concentrate the remaining ensilage fraction by evaporation so that the dry-matter content will be between 30 and 50%. From the patent publication WO 1987004051 it is known to mix together raw fish ensilage, wheat meal from whole grain and gelatine for the production of feed pellets. A formulation mentioned in the patent publication consists of 60-70 per cent by volume of raw fish ensilage, 25-30 per cent by volume of wheat meal and 1-3 per cent by volume of gelatine and 3-8 per cent by volume of vitamins and minerals. The formulation is pressed into pellets. In the production of animal feeds based on ensilage of white fish or of salmonoids, especially in feeds for dogs, it is desirable to avoid using cereal products. The use of cereal products and then wheat in particular is connected with an increased risk of indigestion in dogs. It is also known that the amino-acid profile achieved in the finished product when wheat is used as a binder is not satisfactory- Wheat also has a relatively high glycemic index. The glycemic index is a measurement of how rapidly the blood-sugar level rises after the intake of a food. A high glycemic index in feed is connected with overweight. There is therefore a need to find an alternative to wheat as a binder for fish ensilage. It is known to add ensilage into a cooking-extrusion process. It is also known that the amount of raw ensilage with a water content of over 50% should not exceed 25 per cent by weight of the total mixture present in the extruder barrel. This is because the amount of water in the mixture makes the mixture too wet. This results in the mixture "lubricating" the extruder so that the necessary pressure build-up fails to occur in the extruder barrel. In addition, the extrudate will not expand on pressure relief at the die openings of the extruder, and the extrudate will be too wet for it to be shaped into pellets. The dry matter of aqueous animal ensilage will be referred to, in what follows and in the claims, as ensilage dry matter. The dry matter of vegetable material will be referred to, in what follows and in the claims, as vegetable dry matter. The invention has for its object to remedy or reduce at least one of the drawbacks of the prior art or at least provide a useful alternative to the prior art.

In a third aspect, the invention relates to a use of the cooking-extruded extrudate, made as described above, as a reward feed for a pet. The invention is not restricted to the ensilage of fish material. Ensilage of offal material from land animals can be used as well. The animal ensilage is mixed with a vegetable material. The vegetable material may be a starchy material. In one embodiment, the starchy material may be a pure starch. In particular, the starchy material may be ground. The starchy material may be enriched with respect to starch. Even more particularly, the starchy material may be hulled legumes and enriched with respect to starch. The starchy material may be hulled peas and enriched with respect to starch. The starchy material may also contain proteins. The starch fraction may be cereal starch from wheat or rice, legume starch as from peas or beans, tuber starch as from potato or manioc, or other starch as from bananas. Legume starch and especially legume starch from peas is a co-called low-allergenic raw material. The starchy material may be carried into a so-called preconditioner. The animal ensilage is added to the starchy material in the preconditioner. The mixture is then carried into a co-called cooking-extruder. The cooking-extruder may be a so-called "single- screw" extruder or a so-called "double-screw" extruder. The mass is processed in the extruder barrel and forced out of die openings in the die plate of the extruder. The extrudate can be cut into pellets by a rotating knife. The extrudate can be dried in a dryer, for example a belt dryer or a vertical dryer. In an alternative embodiment, the starchy material, possibly mixed with water or steam, is carried into the extruder barrel and the animal ensilage is added to the starchy material in the extruder barrel. Twenty-five per cent by weight and more of aqueous animal ensilage may be used in the process. The water content of the ensilage may be between 30% by weight and 50% by weight. Relevant ratios of incorporation may be from 25% by weight of aqueous animal ensilage to 60% by weight of aqueous animal ensilage inclusive into the mixture. The dried extrudate may be used alone as an animal feed as the animal ensilage is rich in amino acids / peptides / proteins and some fat, whereas the starchy material contains carbohydrates and proteins. The starchy material has a different amino-acid profile from that of the proteins in the ensilage and the two amino-acid profiles may complement each other with respect to the desired amino-acid composition of the extrudate. Such an animal feed will contain relatively little fat and is therefore well suited as a pet feed as, for example, a so-called reward feed or treat. The dried extrudate can also be used as a protein-containing intermediate product for making an animal feed. A dry extrudate has beneficial qualities with respect to transport, storing and dosing. Such an intermediate product may be mixed with other dry raw materials, possibly by the intermediate product being ground together with some of the other dry raw materials, in order then to be carried into a shaping machine such as a cooking-extruder or a pellet press.
