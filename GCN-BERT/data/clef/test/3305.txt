The present invention relates to a power saving timer for an electric load and more particularly relates to a timer to automatically turn off a refrigerator, electric water heater or other power consuming loads during peak load period and then turn it back on with a onetime manual setup. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION: Most of the household appliances operate on electrical power. Especially some of the electrical appliances such as refrigerators, water heaters etc., consume lot of power. The power scarcity frequently happens during the peak load periods. By switching off the refrigerators for a scheduled time during peak load period would help in reducing the power scarcity. Bacterial decay of food materials is assumed only after a continuous loss of power for 7 hours. Nowadays there are so many public service advertisements published by the local government or electricity board for limiting the power consumption during peak load period. The ads insist the people to switch off their refrigerators during peak load period and then turn it back on after the peak load period. In general, manual intervention is needed to turnoff the refrigerator in the peak load condition and turns it back on after the peak load condition. Another way to turn on or off the electrical appliances in the peak load period can be done with the help of a mechanical / electrical timer device. The mechanical / electrical timer device can be incorporated in the refrigerator or it can be placed between an AC wall outlet and the refrigerator. Such timers operate under its clock period and do not understand the peak load period. Even though some timers with a real time clock (RTC) are available, they do not understand the peak load period and moreover it would also require complicated setup of on time and off time. Conventional timers with a real time clock (RTC) do not consider the off time caused due to power failures. For e.g. If such timer is programmed to turn off at 7pm and turn on at 10pm and if thereâ€™s a power failure for 1 hour at 1pm the timer would still turn off the load for 3 hours. If there is an extended power cut during the day it would be advisable not to disconnect the load during the scheduled off period. Some electrical appliances (e.g. Microwave oven) have a timer with a real time clock. The timer shuts down the power supply of the electrical appliances for a programmed time interval. However, the timer does not retain the time in case of power failure. Turning off refrigerators for 3 hours can prevent frost build up for non frost free refrigerators. Even in frost free refrigerators, defrosting is done by blowing hot air which consumes lot of power. Rather turning off the refrigerator for couple of hours can eliminate the need for defrosting and hence the power consumption of the refrigerator is reduced. WIPO PCT Published Application No. WO 10/033038 relates to a device for controlling power supply to an electrical load. The controlling device is a two terminal device which is plugged between the load and an AC input. The device includes a variable time delay circuit which is used to delay the power supply for the load. The variable time delay is adjusted based on state of the network (i.e) based on supply frequency (f) and supply magnitude (v) of the AC power supply in the network. However, this device does not contain a timer and RTC clock to set the time for turning off the refrigerator in peak-load period and cannot be controlled by the user. U.S. Pat. No. 7,582,985 details on electrical energy saving system. It involves a sticker for indicating schedule of shut-off and starting-up periods for saving energy. This electrical energy saving device cuts off periodically in a staggered form during peak time instead of completely off for the fixed time. The shut off period should be based on energy demand characteristics of the region and it cannot be fixed. It needs a pre programmed timing schedule for shut-off and power on. Moreover, the frequent staggering on and off will result in increased wear and tear and power surges. U.S. Patent Publication No. 2011/0093131 discusses on energy saving for household appliances in which the refrigerator or freezer with a built-in timer will control the flow of electricity by deliberately shutting of the power for a predetermined period of time. However, it does not involve real time clock to track any power failure during past 24 hours and compensating the timer to power off for the left minutes. Further, this system fails to protect the load during voltage fluctuations and high or low voltage conditions. Further, the system discussed in the U.S. Patent No. 5625236 describing on an electrical load controller circuit for controlling power consumption. This system switches off the system based on power consumption of the load. The system has preset current consumption limits, tracks the total power consumption of the loads automatically and it switches off the load current when it exceeds the preset consumption limit. It cannot switch off the system for the preset period of time each day for power saving and it does not track any power failure as overcame in the current invention. Therefore, clearly there is a need for a device that could turn-off the refrigerator during peak load period with a real time clock which retains the time during power failures so that the off time during peak load period is compensated. After the peak load period the device will turn on the load. The present invention accomplishes these objectives SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a power saving timer device for a load. The load described a refrigerator but can be an electric water heater or any similar power consuming appliance. The device is scheduled or programmed to cut the power supply to the refrigerator during peak load hours and allows the power supply after the programmed time. The timer device has a RTC (real-time clock), a microcontroller, a relay, and a reset button. The RTC may be integrally placed in the microcontroller. The timer is a sequential timer and the real time clock (RTC) retains the time during power failures so that the off time during peak load compensated. The reset button in the timer device is used for setting the start of peak load time and it has to be pressed only once on day one. It can also be pre programmed at the factory for a preset time of 6:30 PM. The timer is designed to be positioned between an AC wall outlet and a refrigerator power plug. The timer has a female connector at one end for receiving the power plug of the refrigerator and a male connector at the other end for connecting the timer to the AC wall outlet. It could also be integrated to the refrigerator or any appliance that needs the functionality. An additional embodiment of the present invention, the power saving timer device may include a display unit which displays the real time clock and the units of power saved. The device also has buttons to set the time and program the peak load period. In yet another additional embodiment of the present invention, the power saving timer device has a circuit which protects refrigerator from over voltage as well as under voltage. The circuit will automatically cut off the power supply to the electrical load when high or low voltage occurs. Another embodiment is the power on delay function which protects the refrigerator compressor from frequent power disruptions.

The present timer device is positioned between an electrical appliance power plug and an AC wall outlet. Fig.1 shows the typical block diagram of the current invention and the arrangement of power saving timer device between the refrigerator and the AC wall outlet. The power saving device of the current invention has a microcontroller, a RTC (real-time clock), a load driver which can be a relay or triac, LEDs, and input switches. The power saving device also has a female connector at one end for receiving the power plug of the electrical appliance and a male connector at the other end for connecting with the AC wall outlet. It can also be built into the load such it gets placed between the load and electrical power outlet when the load is plugged in. The microcontroller is powered by a regulated power supply which can be a switch mode power supply or transformerless power supply. The unregulated output is fed to the ADC for under voltage/over voltage detection. The RTC may be a dedicated chip with battery or supercap backup. The RTC functionality may also be incorporated within the microcontroller instead of placing a dedicated RTC chip. The RTC also has a battery backed up RAM which is used to store the current time every second, the last state (as indicated in the legend of Figure, the power failed duration in the last 24 hours and the off period (S1) of the 3 hours (180 minutes). The microcontroller checks whether the current time is peak time and then the line voltage. If the peak time and if S1 is more than 0 then the load is turned off. Every minute S1 decremented and once it is reached zero the load is turned back on. The microcontroller and RTC are programmed to automatically turn off the refrigerator during peak load period and turn on the refrigerator after specified time duration (S1). The relay or triac is triggered by the microcontroller for controlling the turn off and turn on operations of the refrigerator. The microcontroller stores the time to the RTCâ€™s â€˜battery backed up RAMâ€™ for every second and the RTC retains the time during power failures. In case of power failure, the last time when power was present is stored in the RTCs RAM. When power resumes, the microcontroller calculates the difference between the current time (T2) and the time when power failure occurred (T1) to get the duration of power failure (S2). S2=T2-T 1 The caicuiate d time difference (S2) is subtracted from the â€˜programmed off timeâ€™ (S1) to get the compensated off time (D). D = S1-S2 The device turns off the refrigerator for the duration of compensated off time (D) instead of programmed off time (S1). For example, the public service advertisements may insist switch off the refrigerators during peak load period and then turn it back on after 3 hours. If there is a power failure for 1 hour in the past 24 hours, the refrigerator will be switched off for only 2 hours instead of 3 hours during the peak load periods. The duration of off time (S1) for the refrigerator is programmed while manufacturing itself 180 minutes. The peak load period can be programmed by pressing the reset button at the start of peak time. This has to be done only once at the time of installation or if the time not set. The incorrect time is indicated by an LED. The LEDs also indicate the load status and whether the device is in power saving mode. The audio indicator which is a peizo buzzer indicates power resumption, start of power saving mode and end of power saving mode. An additional embodiment of the present invention, the power saving device may include a display unit which displays the real time clock, power failed duration, time remaining for the load to be turned off. The mode switch and up down buttons can be used to set the time and toggle between the displayed values. The dotted area of Fig.1. shows the additional embodiments. The device connection to the power outlet is shown in Fig. 2. It includes LEDs, switches and power outlet for the load. It represents the connection flowchart of the power saving device to the AC wall outlet. The power outlet for Load is used to receive the power plug of the electrical appliance. The Reset button for setting up the off period initially and mode switches for indicating the load status. When the load gets off during the fixed period, the LED display unit or the LCD display unit shows the status of the load. The saving device has provision to display such that the user can observe the load status whether the load receives high voltage or in saving mode or load on state. Fig. 3 represents the overall function of the power saving device through a flowchart for the various states involved in this system. Fig. 4A to Fig. 4G illustrates the functioning of the microcontroller in the power saving device to understand the invention in detail In yet another additional embodiment of the present invention, the power saving device has the functionality to protect the refrigerator from over voltage as well as under voltage. It also can provide a time delay at turn on to protect the compressor of the refrigerator from frequent power disruptions. Additional functionality is accomplished through software and ADC functionality of the micro controller.
