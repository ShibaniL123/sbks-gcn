Referring to FIG. 1, the parallel biometric signal processor 100 includes amplifiers 110, converters 120, preprocessors 130, feature extractors 140, and a switching controller 150. The parallel biometric signal processor 100 further includes a register controller, a power controller, switching fabrics, ports, and a transmitter, which will be described hereinafter with reference to FIG. 2. In one illustrative example, the parallel biometric signal processor 100 is configured in a form of a system on chip (SoC). The amplifiers 110 are arranged in parallel and amplify at least one biometric signal based on at least one amplifying attribute. In one example, at least one signal to be amplified by the amplifiers 110 is an analog signal. Due to the parallel arrangement of the amplifiers 110, each of the amplifiers 110 may amplify a biometric signal based on a predetermined amplifying attribute, independently from other amplifiers 110 and without adversely affecting the performance of the other amplifiers 110. The amplifying attribute may include at least one of an input impedance, a bandwidth, and an amplification gain. The amplifiers 110 may have different amplifying attributes or adaptively adjust the amplifying attribute. Alternatively, the amplifying attribute may be adjusted by a register controller, illustrated in FIG. 2, to be described hereinafter. Also, the amplifiers 110 may include at least one of an instrument amplifier (IA), a programmable gain amplifier (PGA), and a band pass filter (BPF). Although in one configuration, the amplifiers 110 are included within the parallel biometric signal processor 100, in another configuration, the amplifiers 110 may be external to the parallel biometric signal processor 100, while still being controlled by the register controller. The converters 120 are arranged in parallel and convert an amplifying signal from the amplifiers 110 to a converted signal based on at least one converting attribute. In an example, the converters 120 convert an amplifying signal of the amplifiers 110 to a digital signal based on the converting attribute. In one configuration, each converter 120 possesses different converting attributes. As a result of the parallel arrangement of the converters 120, each of the converters 120 may convert an analog signal to a digital signal based on a predetermined converting attribute, independently from other converters 120 and without adversely affecting the performance of the other converters 120. The converting attribute may include at least one of an input dynamic range and an output bit resolution. The preprocessors 130 are arranged in parallel and preprocess a converted signal from the converters 120 based on at least one preprocessing attribute. The preprocessing attribute is an operation of signal processing to be performed in advance to enable the feature extractors 140 to extract biometric information. In one illustrative example, at least one of the preprocessors 130 possesses a different preprocessing attribute from the preprocessors 130. Due to the parallel arrangement of the preprocessors 130, each of the preprocessors 130 preprocesses the converted signal based on a predetermined preprocessing attribute, independently from other preprocessors 130 and without adversely affecting the performance of the other preprocessors 130. The preprocessing attribute may include at least one of an attribute of filtering an unnecessary frequency band of the converted signal and an attribute of extracting at least one set of preprocessing information from the converted signal. Also, the preprocessing information includes at least one of information about a time at which the converted signal is acquired and information about a frequency characteristic of the converted signal. The preprocessors 130 may be configured as a fixed hardware block in a micro controller unit (MCU). The feature extractors 140 are arranged in parallel and extract at least one set of biometric information from an output signal of the preprocessors 130. The biometric information may include information measured from a body of a user such as a blood glucose level, blood pressure, weight, and an electrocardiogram (ECG), information generated by a movement of the user such as a number of strides, and medical information in association with, for example, arrhythmia, angina, and myocardial infarction (MI). In one illustrative example, the feature extractors 140 extract heart rate information by discovering R-peak information from a preprocessed ECG signal and extract the information from the heart rates by discovering peak information from a preprocessed photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal. In another example, the feature extractors 140 extract blood pressure information indicative of a difference in peaks of the preprocessed ECG signal and the preprocessed PPG signal, extract information of a movement of a muscle from a preprocessed electromyogram (EMG) signal, and extract information of a brain activity from an electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. The feature extractors 140 may be configured as a fixed hardware block in an MCU. Ports (not shown) are connected to at least one sensor (not shown) that senses at least one biometric signal. The ports receive the at least one biometric signal from the sensor and transmit the received biometric signal to the amplifiers 110. The sensor may include an electrode sensor to measure a difference of electrical potentials in human body portions, a photochemical sensor, such as, an ion sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET), and a photoelectric sensor, for example, a photodiode sensor, to detect emission, absorption, fluorescence, and reflection of a light. Switching fabrics (not shown) interconnect the amplifiers 110, the converters 120, the preprocessors 130, and the feature extractors 140. Also, a switching fabric may be disposed between the ports and the amplifiers 110. For example, a first switching fabric is disposed between the ports and the amplifiers 110. A second switching fabric is disposed between the amplifiers 110 and the converters 120. A third switching fabric is disposed between the converters 120 and the preprocessors 130. A fourth switching fabric is disposed between the preprocessors 130 and the feature extractors 140. The switching controller 150 controls the switching fabrics and performs routing on at least one target amplifier to which a biometric signal is input, at least one target converter to which an amplifying signal of the target amplifier is input, at least one target preprocessor to which a converted signal of the target converter is input, and at least one feature extractor to which an output signal of the preprocessor is input. The target amplifier, the target converter, the target preprocessor, and the target feature extractor respectively refer to one of the amplifiers 110, the converters 120, the preprocessors 130, and the feature extractors 140 that may be used to extract applicable biometric information. The switching controller 150 selects an amplifier, a converter, a preprocessor, and a feature extractor to extract the biometric information from the amplifiers 110, the converters 120, the preprocessors 130, and the feature extractors 140, respectively. Accordingly, accuracy of the biometric information to be extracted is improved, a degree of freedom and an efficiency of the parallel biometric signal processor 100 is improved, and desired biometric information is extracted based, in one example, solely the parallel biometric signal processor 100, without assistance from another processor. The switching controller 150 performs the routing on a target port that forwards a biometric signal received from the sensor to the target amplifier. In addition, the switching controller 150 also forwards the biometric signal from the target port to the target amplifier, the target converter, the target preprocessor, and the target feature extractor. The target port refers to a port to be used to extract applicable biometric information among the ports. To extract desired information from the at least one biometric signal, the switching controller 150 connects a target amplifier, a target converter, a target preprocessor, and a target feature extractor that may meet required specifications. For example, to extract information on heart rates from an electrocardiography (ECG) signal, the switching controller 150 performs routing on a target amplifier having an amplification gain of 100 among the amplifiers 110, a target converter having a converting attribute of a 12 bit resolution among the converters 120, a target preprocessor having a preprocessing attribute of eliminating a direct current (DC) offset among the preprocessors 130, and a target feature extractor extracting a heart rate among the feature extractors 140. Through the routing by the switching controller 150, the target amplifier amplifies by a factor of one hundred, the ECG signal having a frequency band in a range 0.5 hertz (Hz) to 40 Hz. The target converter converts an amplifying signal to a digital signal based on the 12 bit resolution. The target preprocessor eliminates the DC offset of a converted signal, and the target feature extractor extracts the information on the heart rates by discovering an R peak from the preprocessed ECG signal. The switching controller 150 performs the routing of the at least one biometric signal through the target amplifier, the target converter, the target preprocessor, and the target feature extractor based on routing paths. For example, when each of a number of the amplifiers 110, the converters 120, the preprocessors 130, and the feature extractors 140 is three, a first routing path used to extract the information on the heart rates from the ECG signal includes a first amplifier, a first converter, a third preprocessor, and a third feature extractor. A second routing path used to extract the information on the movement of the muscle from the EMG signal includes a second amplifier, a second converter, a first preprocessor, and a second feature extractor. Based on the first routing path and the second routing path, the switching controller 150 simultaneously processes the ECG signal and the EMG signal by simultaneously performing the routing through the first and second target amplifiers, the first and second target converters, the third and first target preprocessors, and the third and second target feature extractors. The term simultaneously may be defined as a same time processing the ECG signal and the EMG signal or one signal after another within a minimal time frame difference or within a small or negligible margin of time difference. The switching controller 150 reroutes a signal through the target amplifier, the target converter, the target preprocessor, and the target feature extractor. For example, when each of a number of the amplifiers 110, the converters 120, the preprocessors 130, and the feature extractors 140 is four, and the blood pressure information to be extracted is from a biometric signal, the switching controller 150 selects the first amplifier, a third converter, the third preprocessor, and a fourth feature extractor as the target amplifier, the target converter, the target preprocessor, and the target feature extractor, respectively. When the information on the movement of the muscle is to be extracted from the biometric signal, the switching controller 150 selects the second amplifier, the first converter, a second preprocessor, and the third feature extractor as the target amplifier, the target converter, the target preprocessor, and the target feature extractor, respectively. Also, the switching controller 150 performs the routing through the target amplifier, the target converter, the target preprocessor, and the target feature extractor based on an operating mode. The operating mode may include a low power operating mode and a high precision operating mode. For example, when each of a number of the amplifiers 110, the converters 120, the preprocessors 130, and the feature extractors 140 is two, respectively, a first amplifier, a first converter, and a first preprocessor has a lower performance and less power consumption than a second amplifier, a second converter, and a second preprocessor. A first feature extractor extracts information of an arrhythmia, while a second feature extractor extracts information on brain activity. When the operating mode is the low power operating mode, the switching controller 150 selects the first amplifier, the first converter, the first preprocessor, and the first feature extractor as the target amplifier, the target converter, the target preprocessor, and the target feature extractor, respectively. Conversely, when the operating mode is the high precision operating mode, the switching controller 150 selects the second amplifier, the second converter, the second preprocessor, and the first feature extractor as the target amplifier, the target converter, the target preprocessor, and the target feature extractor, respectively. The register controller (to be later discussed with respect to FIG. 2) monitors and controls detailed attributes of the amplifiers 110, the converters 120, the preprocessors 130, and the feature extractors 140. For example, the register controller adjusts an input impedance, a bandwidth, and an amplification gain of the amplifiers 110, an input dynamic range and an output bit resolution of the converters 120, and bandwidths and sampling rates of the preprocessors 130 and the feature extractors 140, based on a control signal from the switching controller 150 or an external source. The power controller (to be later discussed with respect to FIG. 2) controls power to be provided to the amplifiers 110, the converters 120, the preprocessors 130, the feature extractors 140, and the ports. For example, the power controller provides the power to the target port, the target amplifier, the target converter, the target preprocessor, and the target feature extractor on which the routing is performed by the switching controller 150. The power controller also blocks the power to remaining ports, remaining amplifiers, remaining converters, remaining preprocessors, and remaining feature extractors. Accordingly, the parallel biometric signal processor 100 reduces power consumption. A transmitter transmits the biometric information extracted by the target feature extractor to an external device. In one example, the transmitter includes at least one of a wired interface to be wiredly connected to the external device and a wireless interface to be wirelessly connected to the external device. The transmitter transmits the biometric information to the external device using the wired interface or the wireless interface. The wired interface includes at least one of a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART), a serial peripheral interface (SPI), and an inter-integrated circuit (I2C). The wireless interface includes at least one of body area network (BAN), Bluetooth, ZigBee, and near field communication (NFC). FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating an example of a parallel biometric signal processor 200. Referring to FIG. 2, the parallel biometric signal processor 200 includes 1 to k ports, for example, 201 through 203, an analog front end (AFE) unit 220, an analog to digital converter (ADC) unit 230, a digital preprocessor 240, a feature extractor 250, a switching controller 260, a register controller 270, and a power controller 280. Also, the parallel biometric signal processor 200 includes a port switching fabric 211 to connect the k ports 201 through 203 and the AFE unit 220, an AFE switching fabric 212 to connect the AFE unit 220 and the ADC unit 230, an ADC switching fabric 213 to connect the ADC unit 230 and the digital preprocessor 240, and a digital signal processor (DSP) switching fabric 214 to connect the digital preprocessor 240 and the feature extractor 250. The AFE unit 220 includes m amplifiers, for example, 221 through 224. The ADC unit 230 includes n converters, for example, 231 through 234. The digital preprocessor 240 includes p preprocessors, for example, 241 through 244. The feature extractor 250 includes q feature extractors, for example, 251 through 254. The k ports 201 through 203 are connected to a sensor, for example, an electrode sensor to measure a potential difference of human body portions, a photochemical sensor, such as an ISFET, and a photoelectric sensor, for example, a photodiode sensor, to detect emission, absorption, fluorescence, and reflection of light. The k ports 201 through 203 are connected to other sensors in addition to the electrode sensor, the photochemical sensor, and the photoelectric sensor. The switching controller 260 selects at least one target port suitable for desired biometric information from among the k ports 201 through 203. The target port receives the biometric information from the sensor connected to the target port and transmits the received biometric information to at least one of the m amplifiers 221 through 224. The m amplifiers 221 through 224 are disposed in parallel, and amplify a biometric signal input from at least one of the k ports 201 through 203 based on an amplifying attribute. The switching controller 260 selects at least one amplifier as a target amplifier from among the m amplifiers 221 through 224 in accord with desired biometric information. The target amplifier may amplify the biometric signal based on an amplifying attribute of the target amplifier. In an example, the m amplifiers 221 through 224 may have different amplifying attributes. In another example, the m amplifiers 221 through 224 may be a programmable amplifier that adjusts the amplifying attribute such as an input impedance, a bandwidth, and an amplification gain. Also, the m amplifiers 221 through 224 may include at least one of an IA, a PGA, and a BPF. A switching fabric is disposed among the m amplifiers 221 through 224. The switching controller 260 controls the switching fabric disposed among the m amplifiers 221 through 224. In one illustrative configuration, the n converters 231 through 234 in the ADC unit 230 are arranged in parallel, and convert an amplifying signal from at least one of the m amplifiers 221 through 224 in the AFE unit 220 to a digital signal based on a converting attribute. The converting attribute includes at least one of an input dynamic range and an output bit resolution. The n converters 231 through 234 include different input dynamic ranges and different output bit resolutions. The switching controller 260 selects a converter suitable for desired biometric information as a target converter from among the n converters 231 through 234. The target converter converts the amplifying signal to the digital signal based on a converting attribute of the target converter. The p preprocessors 241 through 244 in the digital preprocessor 240 are arranged in parallel, and preprocess a converted signal from at least one of the n converters 231 through 234 based on a preprocessing attribute. The preprocessing attribute may include at least one of an attribute of filtering an unnecessary frequency band of the converted signal and an attribute of extracting at least one set of preprocessing information on the converted signal. The preprocessing information may include at least one of information on time at which the converted signal is acquired and information on a frequency characteristic of the converted signal. For example, a preprocessing attribute of a first preprocessor 241 is the attribute of filtering the unnecessary frequency band of the converted signal. The first preprocessor 241 includes a high pass filter (HPF), a BPF, or a low pass filter (LPF). The HPF, the BPF, or the LPF may be implemented through a finite impulse response (FIR) and an infinite impulse response (IIR). In another example, a preprocessing attribute of a second preprocessor 242 is an attribute of extracting the information on time at which the converted signal is acquired. The second preprocessor 242 stores a local real time clock (RTC) value of a point in time at which a sample of the converted signal is acquired along with the converted signal. For still another example, a preprocessing attribute of a third preprocessor 243 may be the attribute of extracting the information on the frequency characteristic of the converted signal. The third preprocessor 243 may extract the information on the frequency characteristic of the converted signal using a fast Fourier transform (FFT). The switching controller 260 selects at least one preprocessor associated with desired biometric information as a target preprocessor from among the p preprocessors 241 through 244. The target preprocessor preprocesses the converted signal based on a preprocessing attribute of the target preprocessor. The q feature extractors 251 through 254 are connected in parallel and at least one of the q feature extractors 251 through 254 extract at least one set of the biometric information from an output signal of at least one of the p preprocessors 241 through 244. For example, a first feature extractor 251 extracts information about a heart rate, a second feature extractor 252 extracts blood pressure information, a third feature extractor 253 extracts information of usage of a muscle, and a fourth feature extractor 254 extracts information about a brain activity. The switching controller 260 selects at least one feature extractor that may extract desired biometric information as a target feature extractor from among the q feature extractors 251 through 254. The target feature extractor extracts the biometric information from the output signal of the target preprocessor. The switching controller 260 controls the port switching fabric 211, the AFE switching fabric 212, the ADC switching fabric 213, and the DSP switching fabric 214 to perform routing of a biometric signal received at the target port. The biometric signal includes desired biometric information to be extracted. The switching controller 260 controls the port switching fabric 211 so that the target amplifier in the AFE unit 220 receives the biometric signal from the target port. The switching controller 260 controls the AFE switching fabric 212 so that the target converter in the ADC unit 230 receives the amplifying signal from the target amplifier. The switching controller 260 controls the ADC switching fabric 213 so that the target preprocessor at the digital preprocessor 240 receives the converted signal from the target converter. The switching controller 260 controls the DSP switching fabric 214 so that the target feature extractor at the feature extractor unit 250 receives an output signal from the target preprocessor. For example, an electrode sensor is attached to a human body to extract the information on a usage of a muscle, and a photodiode sensor and a pressure sensor are attached to the human body to extract heart rate information. In one illustrative example, the electrode sensor senses an EMG signal, the photodiode sensor senses a PPG signal, and the pressure sensor senses a pressure signal. The parallel biometric signal processor 200 simultaneously processes the EMG signal, the PPG signal, and the pressure signal to simultaneously provide the information on the usage of the muscle and the heart rate information. To process the EMG signal, the switching controller 260 performs the routing through a first port 201, a first amplifier 221, a second converter 232, a first preprocessor 241, and a third feature extractor 253. To process the PPG signal, the switching controller 260 routes the PPG signal through a second port 202, a second amplifier 222, a third converter 233, a second preprocessor 242, and a first feature extractor 251. Similarly, to process the pressure signal, the switching controller 260 routes the pressure signal through a third port 203, a third amplifier 223, a first converter 231, a third preprocessor 243, and the first feature extractor 251. The third feature extractor 253 extracts the information on the usage of the muscle from the preprocessed EMG signal, and the first feature extractor 251 extracts the heart rate information from the preprocessed PPG signal and the preprocessed pressure signal. As described in the foregoing, the parallel biometric signal processor 200 processes multiple biometric signals using a single chip. Accordingly, when the parallel biometric signal processor 200 is used as a sensor, a low-power small-sized sensor is implemented. Also, the parallel biometric signal processor 200 processes multiple biometric signals without an additional algorithm to process a biometric signal. The register controller 270 controls detailed attributes of the m amplifiers 221 through 224, the n converters 231 through 234, the p preprocessors 241 through 244, and the q feature extractors 251 through 254. The power controller 280 controls power to be provided to the m amplifiers 221 through 224, the n converters 231 through 234, the p preprocessors 241 through 244, and the q feature extractors 251 through 254. For example, when the switching controller 260 performs the routing through the first amplifier 221, the first converter 231, the first preprocessor 241, and the first feature extractor 251, the power controller 280 supplies the power to the first amplifier 221, the first converter 231, the first preprocessor 241, and the first feature extractor 251.

Also, the parallel biometric signal processor 300 includes a port switching fabric 311 to connect the four ports 301 through 304 and the AFE unit 320, an AFE switching fabric 312 to connect the AFE unit 320 and the ADC unit 330, an ADC switching fabric 313 to connect the ADC unit 330 and the digital preprocessor 340, and a DSP switching fabric 314 to connect the digital preprocessor 340 and the feature extractor 350.

In one illustrative example, the AFE unit 320 includes three amplifiers, for example, 321 through 323. A first amplifier 321 is a high-performance amplifier having an amplification gain of 6 decibels (dB) and a common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of -115 dB. A second amplifier 322 and a third amplifier 323 are a low-power amplifier having an amplification gain of 1 dB and a CMRR of -100 dB. The ADC unit 330 includes two converters, for example, 331 and 332.

The digital preprocessor 340 includes four preprocessors, for example, 341 through 344. A first preprocessor 341 and a third preprocessor 343 filter an unnecessary frequency band of a converted signal, and a second preprocessor 342 and a fourth preprocessor 344 extract information on time at which the converted signal is acquired. The feature extractor 350 includes three feature extractors, for example, 351 through 353. A first feature extractor 351 extracts information on heart rates from a preprocessed biometric signal, a second feature extractor 352 extracts information on arrhythmia detection from a preprocessed biometric signal, and a third feature extractor 353 extracts blood pressure information from a preprocessed biometric signal. To detect an arrhythmia, the switching controller 360 routes at least one signal through a target port, a target amplifier, a target converter, a target preprocessor, and a target feature extractor. The switching controller 360 selects, as the target port, the first port 301 connected to the first electrode sensor sensing a desirable quality ECG signal from between the first electrode sensor and the second electrode sensor. The switching controller 360 selects the second amplifier 322 and the second converter 332 that consumes a lower amount of power than the target amplifier and the target converter, respectively. Also, the switching controller 360 selects the first preprocessor 341 as the target preprocessor to eliminate a frequency band exceeding 40 Hz, and selects the second feature extractor 352 that extracts the information on the detection of the arrhythmia as the target feature extractor. As indicated by a dotted line, the switching controller 360 performs the routing of a signal through the first port 301, the second amplifier 322, the second converter 332, the first preprocessor 341, and the second feature extractor 352 by controlling the port switching fabric 311, the AFE switching fabric 312, the ADC switching fabric 313, and the DSP switching fabric 314. Accordingly, the first port 301 receives the ECG signal from the first electrode sensor and transmits the ECG signal to the second amplifier 322. The second amplifier 322 amplifies the received ECG signal based on the amplification gain of 1 dB and the CMRR of -100 dB. The second converter 332 having the 12 bit resolution, for instance, samples an amplifying signal using a sampling frequency of 256 Hz. The ECG signal may include significant information in a frequency band of 0 through 40 Hz. The first preprocessor 341 changes a number of taps and a coefficient of a digital filter and filter a frequency band exceeding 40 Hz of the converted ECG signal. The second feature extractor 352 detects the arrhythmia from the filtered ECG signal in real time. FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating an example of an operation of a parallel biometric signal processor 400 to extract arrhythmia detection information in a high precision operating mode. Referring to FIG. 4, the parallel biometric signal processor 400 includes four ports, for example, 401 through 404, an AFE unit 420, an ADC unit 430, a digital preprocessor 440, a feature extractor 450, a switching controller 460, a register controller 470, a power controller 480, and four switching fabrics, for example, 411 through 414. Characteristics of a first amplifier 421 through a third amplifier 423, a first converter 431 and a second converter 432, a first preprocessor 441 through a fourth preprocessor 444, and a first feature extractor 451 through a third feature extractor 453 may be the same as characteristics of the first amplifier 321 through the third amplifier 323, the first converter 331 and the second converter 332, the first preprocessor 341 through the fourth preprocessor 344, and the first feature extractor 351 through the third feature extractor 353 illustrated in FIG. 3. When blood pressure and heart rate information is provided along with the arrhythmia detection information, medical diagnostic accuracy may increase. The heart rate information and the arrhythmia detection information may be extracted from an ECG signal, and the blood pressure information be extracted from ECG information and a PPG signal. Accordingly, the parallel biometric signal processor 400 processes the ECG signal using a first routing path and the PPG signal using a second routing path. In an example, the parallel biometric signal processor 400 simultaneously processes the first routing path and the second routing path to simultaneously extract the arrhythmia detection information, the blood pressure information, and the heart rate information. To process the ECG signal based on the first routing path, the switching controller 460 performs routing on a target port, a target amplifier, a target converter, a first target preprocessor, a second target preprocessor, and a first target feature extractor through a third target feature extractor by controlling a port switching fabric 411, an AFE switching fabric 412, an ADC switching fabric 413, and a DSP switching fabric 414. The switching controller 460 selects, as the target port, a first port 401 connected to a first electrode sensor sensing a desirable quality ECG signal from between the first electrode sensor and a second electrode sensor.

The switching controller 460 also selects, as the second target feature extractor, a second feature extractor 452 to extract the arrhythmia detection information, and selects, as the third target feature extractor, a third feature extractor 453 to extract the blood pressure information. Along the first routing path as indicated by a dotted line, the first port 401 receives the ECG signal from the first electrode sensor and transmits the ECG signal to the first amplifier 421. The first amplifier 421 amplifies the received ECG signal based on an amplification gain of 6 dB and a CMRR of -115 dB. The first converter 431 having a 24 bit resolution samples the amplified ECG signal with a sampling frequency of 1024 Hz or 2048 Hz. The ECG signal may include significant information in a frequency band in a range of 0 through 40 Hz. Thus, the first preprocessor 441 changes a number of taps and a coefficient of a digital filter and filter a frequency band exceeding 40 Hz of the sampled ECG signal. The second preprocessor 442 extracts a local RTC value at a point in time at which a sample of the sampled ECG signal from the first converter 431 is acquired. The first feature extractor 451 extracts the heart rate information from the preprocessed ECG signal, and the second feature extractor 452 detects an arrhythmia from the preprocessed ECG signal. The third feature extractor 453 extracts the blood pressure information from the preprocessed ECG signal, a local RTC value of the ECG signal, a preprocessed PPG signal obtained through the second routing path, and a local RTC value of the PPG signal. To process the PPG signal based on the second routing path, the switching controller 460 performs the routing of a signal through the target port, the target amplifier, the target converter, the first target preprocessor, the second target preprocessor, and the target feature extractor by controlling the port switching fabric 411, the AFE switching fabric 412, the ADC switching fabric 413, and the DSP switching fabric 414. The switching controller 460 selects, as the target port, the fourth port 404 connected to a second photodiode sensor sensing a desirable quality PPG signal from between a first photodiode sensor and the second photodiode sensor. The switching controller 460 selects the third amplifier 423 and the second converter 432 that consumes a lower amount of power than the target amplifier and the target converter. Also, the switching controller 460 selects the third preprocessor 443 as the first target preprocessor to eliminate a frequency band exceeding 5 Hz, and the fourth preprocessor 444 as the second target preprocessor to extract the information at a point in time at which the converted signal is acquired. The switching controller 460 selects, as the target feature extractor, the third feature extractor 453 to extract the blood pressure information. Along the second routing path as indicated by a bold line in FIG. 4, the fourth port 404 may receive the PPG signal from the second photodiode sensor and transmit the PPG signal to the third amplifier 423. The third amplifier 423 may amplify the received PPG signal based on an amplification gain of 1 dB and a CMRR of -100 dB. The second converter 432 having a 12 bit resolution may sample an amplifying signal with a sampling frequency of 256 Hz. The third preprocessor 443 may change a number of taps and a coefficient of a digital filter and filter the frequency band exceeding 40 Hz of the sampled PPG signal. The fourth preprocessor 444 may extract a local RTC value of a point in time at which a sample of a converted signal of the second converter 432 is acquired. The third feature extractor 453 extracts the blood pressure information from the preprocessed ECG signal obtained through the first routing path, the local RTC value of the ECG signal, the preprocessed PPG signal, and the local RTC value of the PPG signal. In accordance with an embodiment, the parallel biometric signal processor 400 simultaneously processes the first routing path and the second routing path, and externally transmits the information on the heart rates, the arrhythmia detection information, and the blood pressure information extracted through the first routing path and the second routing path. FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating an example of an operation of the third feature extractor 453 of FIG. 4. Referring to FIG. 5, the third feature extractor 453 obtains an ECG signal 510 and a local RTC value of the ECG signal 510 through the first routing path, and obtains a PPG signal 520 and a local RTC value of the PPG signal 520 through the second routing path. The third feature extractor 453 extracts an R peak value 511 having a highest numerical value from the ECG signal 510, and extracts a peak value 521 having a highest numerical value from the PPG signal 520. The third feature extractor 453 calculates a pulse transit time (PTT) indicating a time difference between the R peak value 511 and the peak value 521. The third feature extractor 453 extracts blood pressure information without use of a cuff system based on the calculated PTT.
