PROTEIN KINASE INHIBITORS Technical field The present invention relates to therapeutically active compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which are useful e.g. in the treatment of cancer. Background of the invention Protein kinases are a class of proteins (enzymes) that regulate a variety of cellular functions. This is accomplished by phosphorylation of specific amino acids on protein substrates resulting in conformational alteration of the substrate protein. The conformational change modulates the activity of the substrate or its ability to interact With other binding partners. Tyrosine kinases are a subset of protein kinases that catalyze the transfer of the terminal phosphate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to tyrosine residues on protein substrates. The human genome contains around 90 tyrosine kinases and 43 tyrosine kinase like genes, the products of which regulate cellular proliferation, survival; differentiation, function and motility. Tyrosine kinases are of two varieties, i.e. receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., FGFR) are trans-membrane proteins with a ligand-binding extracellular domain and a catalytic intracellular kinase domain, while non-receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., c-ABL) lack trans-membrane domains and are found in the cytosol, nucleus and inner surface of cell membrane. Kinase domains of all tyrosine kinases have bilobar architecture, with an N-terminal lobe that binds ATP and magnesium, a C-terminal lobe containing an activation loop, and a cleft between the lobes to which polypeptide substrates bind. Receptor tyrosine kinases become activated when ligand binds to the extracellular domain, resulting in receptor oligomerization and autophosphorylation of a regulatory tyrosine within the activation loop of the kinase domain. These phenomena reorient important amino acid residues, thereby enhancing catalytic activity of the enzyme. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) has been recognized as an important mediator of many physiological processes, such as cell migration, proliferation, survival and differentiation during development and angiogenesis. There are currently over 25 known members of the FGF family. The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family consists of four members with each composed of an extra cellular ligand binding domain, a single trans-membrane domain and an intracellular cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase domain. Upon stimulation with FGF, FGFRs undergo dimerisation and transphosphorylation. Upon dimerization, FGFRs activate range of downstream signaling pathways, such as ΜΑΡΚ and PKB/Akt pathways (Zhou, W. et. al. Chemistry & Biology, 2010, 17; 285). Abnormal FGFR signaling has been reported in many tumor types including multiple myeloma,® gastric, endometrial, prostate and breast (Squires Μ. et. al. Mol. Cancer Ther., September 2011, 10:1542-1552). FGFs also have role in tumor angiogenesis and mediate resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) inhibitors (Casanovas, O. et. al., Cancer Cell, 2005, 8, 299). Consequently, FGF and FGFRs have the potential to initiate and/or promote tumorigenesis. Due to this, the FGF signaling system happens to be an attractive therapeutic target, mainly because therapies targeting FGFRs and/or FGF signaling may affect bdth the tumor cells arid also tumor angiogenesis (Foote, Κ. Μ. et. al., WO ts 2009/019518 Al). Consequently, FGF arid FGFRs have the potential to initiate and/or promote tumorigenesis.
