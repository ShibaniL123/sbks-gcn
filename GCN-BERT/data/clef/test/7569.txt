(9) Preparation of di(tert-butyl) 7-((2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxamido)-3,9-diazabicyclo[3. 3.1]nonane-3,9-dicarboxylate
(2S,5R)-6-(benzyloxy)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylic acid (364.7 mg, 1.32 mmol) and di(tert-butyl) 7-amino-3,9-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,9-dicarboxylate (450 mg, 1.32 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (20 mL), triethylamine (400.7 mg, 3.96 mmol), 1-ethyl-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (379.6 mg, 1.98 mmol) and 1-hydroxylbenzotriazole (267.5 mg, 1.98 mmol) were added, stirred at 25Â°C for 16h. After completion of the reaction as measured by TLC (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate =1:1), concentrated in vacuum, the crude product was separated by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate =1:1) to obtain the title compound (250 mg, yield 31.6%).
