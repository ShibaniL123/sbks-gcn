The present invention relates to a joint prosthesis for small bones, in particular a trapezio-metacarpal or interphalangeal prosthesis. It also relates to an instrument for removing such a prosthesis. Such a prosthesis comprises at least one elongated implant forming a medullary anchoring portion, said medullary portion being designed to be inserted into the medullary channel of an elongated bone that is part of the joint to be treated. This elongated implant is in particular the metacarpal implant in the case of a trapezio-metacarpal prosthesis, and each phalangeal implant in the case of an interphalangeal prosthesis. In the event of reoperation on such a prosthesis, it is essential to be able to remove the elongated implant(s) easily, failing which the operation is made complex and serious damage may be caused to the concerned bones, the dimensions of which are reduced. One type of existing prostheses comprises a single-piece elongated implant, in which the medullary element is secured to the spherical articular head. This spherical articular head has the advantage of being able to serve as a gripping point for removal of the implant; however, the single-piece implant has the major drawback of not allowing its distance to be adjusted in relation to the conjugated joint implant, and therefore of not allowing adjustment of the ligament tension. To resolve this drawback, it has been considered to produce such an elongated implant using two assemblable elements, i.e. a medullary element and a joint element, that can be assembled together; the prosthesis is obtained from a range of elements comprising one or more medullary elements and several joint elements that can be fastened on the medullary element, the most suitable of which for reconstruction of the joint may be chosen and fastened on the medullary element. The assembly between said medullary element and each joint element is generally done using (i) a conical cavity formed in the proximal portion of the medullary element, i.e. in the portion thereof designed to be turned toward the joint, and (ii) a conical tip formed at the end of a lug secured to the joint element, said lug being able to be jammed in said cavity. One known prosthesis of this type has a threaded bore formed below said conical cavity and emerging in the bottom thereof, which becomes accessible when said joint element is removed, and in which a rod for extracting said medullary element may be screwed. Said medullary element may thus be removed relatively easily; however, the medullary element has the drawback of having to have a large proximal portion, i.e. large enough to house the conical cavity and the tapped bore, and of having to have a rectilinear shape, which does not comport with the anatomy. This rectilinear shape is therefore not very suitable for a complete restoration of the movement of a trapezio-metacarpal or interphalangeal joint. Another known prosthesis of this type has an anatomical medullary element, i.e. with a bent shape at the proximal portion thereof, but then not comprising means allowing it to be removed easily, which is a significant drawback, as indicated above. Documents FR 2 912 899 A1, US 4,955,916 A, E P 1 632 200 A1 and FR 2 728 783 A1 illustrate various known prostheses. FR 2912899 is forming the basis for the preamble of claim 1. The present invention aims to resolve the aforementioned drawbacks by providing a prosthetic joint including at least one elongated bone implant whereof the medullary element has a bent anatomical shape as cited above, and which is also capable of being moved easily in case of reoperation. The concerned prosthesis comprises, in a known manner, at least one elongated bone implant formed by assembling a medullary element with a bent proximal portion and a joint element. According to the invention, said medullary element has a gripping groove arranged at the proximal portion thereof. This groove is designed to receive two grippers comprised by an instrument for removing the prosthesis, the jaws of which are in the shape of circular sectors corresponding to the shape of said groove. These jaws are thus suitable for being narrowly engaged in said groove, extending over a large portion of the periphery of the groove. "Large portion of the periphery" refers to a portion corresponding to at least 180° of that periphery. The groove extends over the majority, or even all, of the perimeter of said proximal portion, which not only allows several possible angular positions of the removal instrument in relation to the medullary element, but also makes it possible to have sufficient gripping surfaces to allow the removal force to be exerted. Preferably, said groove has a dovetail profile, i.e. is delimited by a conical wall and by an annular wall perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the medullary element. Advantageously, in that case, said conical wall is proximal, i.e. situated on the side of the proximal end of the medullary element, and said annular wall is distal. The apical angle of the cone generating said conical wall may range from 60° to 80°, and is preferably 70°. According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the means for adapting each joint element on said medullary element comprise a conical tip with a small slope, secured to each joint element, and a conical cavity with a corresponding slope, formed in said proximal portion of the medullary element and emerging in the proximal end surface of this element. "Small slope" refers to a slope smaller than approximately 15°. Preferably, the prosthesis, when it is a trapezio-metacarpal prosthesis, comprises a cone-shaped trapezium implant, whereof the base with a larger section is designed to rest against the resected trapezium and the portion with a small section forms a spherical articular cavity for receiving a spherical articular head comprised by each joint element. Unlike the known trapezium implants, this trapezium implant according to the invention does not have a bowl-shaped cavity formed inside itself; due to its shape, it projects over the outside of the trapezium, toward the metacarpal implant, and thereby also makes it possible to project the articular cavity it forms in the same direction. The prosthesis according to the invention thus makes it possible to obtain an articulation point situated at the location occupied, before resection, by the proximal end of the metacarpal, which better comports with the anatomy of the trapezio-metacarpal joint than the traditional structure of trapezio-metacarpal prostheses, including a bowl-shaped trapezium implant, the articular cavity of which is located inside the trapezium. The instrument for removing the medullary element of the prosthesis comprises two aforementioned grippers, the jaws of which are in the shape of a circular sector capable of extending over a wide portion of the periphery of said groove, and maintaining means for maintaining said grippers in position close to one another, making it possible to maintain the engagement of said grippers in said groove. These maintaining means can in particular be made up of two substantially semicircular threaded portions arranged at the base of said grippers, on which a nut is capable to be screwed, the progression of that nut over the threaded portions, in the direction of screwing, making it possible to tighten the grippers toward one another. The invention also relates to an instrument for removing a joint element adapted on said medullary element, said joint element comprising a spherical articular head connected by a neck to a mounting end on said medullary element; said instrument comprises a cylindrical head, arranged in which are a cavity capable of receiving the spherical articular head in an adjusted manner and a radial notch putting the cavity in communication with the outside of the cylindrical head; when the spherical articular head is engaged in said cavity and the neck is engaged in said radial notch, the peripheral wall of the cylindrical head is capable to bear against the proximal end of said medullary element. The instrument thus acts on said joint element like a lever, exerting a removal force in the axial direction of said end and thereby making it possible to remove that end outside the cavity of said medullary element. The invention will be better understood, and other features and advantages thereof will appear, in reference to the appended diagrammatic drawing, showing, as a non-limiting example, one preferred embodiment of a trapezio-metacarpal prosthesis according to the invention. Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view;figure 2 is a side view, in the assembled state, of its component elements;figure 3 is an enlarged side view of the proximal portion of the medullary element comprised by said prosthesis, seen from a direction perpendicular to the viewing direction of figure 2;figure 4 is a view of the prosthesis after implantation, the bones being shown in cross-section;figure 5 is a view of the prosthesis and an instrument for removing a spherical articular head comprised by that prosthesis, during an operation to remove the head;figure 6 is a view of the medullary element comprised by the prosthesis and an instrument for removing said element, in partial cross-section, andfigure 7 is a view of said medullary element and said instrument, in cross-section along line VII-VII of figure 6. Figures 2 and 4 show a trapezio-metacarpal prosthesis 1, formed by assembling three elements 2, 3, 4 individually visible in figure 1, i.e. a metacarpal element 2, a joint element 3, and a trapezium element 4. The metacarpal element 2 has a bent shape defining a proximal portion 2a with a wide section and a slender distal portion 2b. The proximal portion 2a has a gripping groove 5 and a conical cavity 6 formed in its proximal end surface. The groove 5 extends over 270° of the perimeter of the proximal portion 2a. As shown more particularly in figure 3, it has a dovetail profile, i.e. it is delimited by a conical proximal wall 5a and an annular distal wall 5b, perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the element 2. The apical angle of the cone generating the conical wall 5a is approximately 70°. The conical cavity 6 has a small slope, for example having an apical angle of about 7°. The joint element 3 comprises a spherical joint portion 3a and a neck 3b forming a conical end with a slope corresponding to that of the cavity 6, said end being capable of being narrowly inserted and jammed into said cavity 6 to ensure mounting of the element 3 on the element 2. The prosthesis 1 is obtained from a range of elements including a plurality of joint elements 3 of different shapes (with more or less elongated, straight or bent necks 3b); the joint element 3 best suited to proper reconstruction of the joint may thus be chosen from the series of joint elements and may be placed on the element 2 so as to form the metacarpal implant of the prosthesis therewith. The trapezium element 4 comprises a body 4a and an anchor base 4b. The body 4a is in the shape of a cone, having a base with a larger section designed to rest against the resected trapezium and a portion with a smaller section forming a spherical articular cavity, for receiving the head 3a of the joint element 3. This body 4a also comprises four peripheral notches allowing it to be gripped for screwing in the trapezium. The anchor base 4b assumes the form of a screw, making it possible to place the element 4 in the trapezium by screwing. As shown by figure 4, after placement on a trapezium 100, the body 4a projects over the outside of the trapezium 100, toward the metacarpal implant, and thereby also makes it possible to project the articular cavity it forms in the same direction. As a result, the element 4 makes it possible to obtain an articulation point situated at the location occupied, before resection, by the proximal end of the metacarpal 101, which comports with the anatomy of the trapezio-metacarpal joint. Figure 5 shows an instrument 20 that can be used, in case of reoperation on the joint, to remove the joint element 3. This instrument 20 comprises a cylindrical head 21, situated at the end of the sleeve 22, formed in which are a cavity 23 suitable for receiving the spherical articular head 3a in an adjusted manner and a radial notch 24 putting that cavity 23 in communication with the outside of the head 21. When the head 3a is engaged in the cavity 23 and the neck 3b is engaged in the notch 24, the peripheral wall of the head 21 can bear against the proximal end of the element 2; the instrument 20 thus acts on the element 3 like a lever, exerting a removal force in the axial direction of said end and making it possible to remove said end outside the cavity 6. Figure 6 shows an instrument 30 for removing the element 2, which comprises two grippers 31, the jaws 32 of which are in the shape of a circular sector capable of extending over a wide portion of the periphery of the groove 5 and able to be narrowly engaged in the groove 5, extending over a wide portion of the periphery of that groove (cf. figure 7). These grippers 31 comprise two outwardly-threaded semicircular base portions 31 a, on which a nut 33 can be screwed, the progression of that nut 33 on said threaded portions 31 a, in the screwing direction, making it possible to tighten the grippers 31 toward one another. The assembly thus makes a means for keeping the grippers 31 in position close to each other, making it possible to maintain the engagement of those grippers in said groove 5. As appears from the preceding, the invention resolves the drawbacks of existing prosthetic joints for small bones by providing a prosthesis whereof the medullary element 2 has a bent anatomical shape and can also be removed easily in case of reoperation.
