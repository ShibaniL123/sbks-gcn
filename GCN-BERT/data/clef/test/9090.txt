CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. application No. 12/124,991, filed on May 21, 2008, the teaching of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a terpolymer for coating an implantable device. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a procedure for treating heart disease. A catheter assembly having a balloon portion is introduced percutaneously into the cardiovascular system of a patient via the brachial or femoral artery. The catheter assembly is advanced through the coronary vasculature until the balloon portion is positioned across the occlusive lesion. Once in position across the lesion, the balloon is inflated to a predetermined size to radially compress the atherosclerotic plaque of the lesion to remodel the lumen wall. The balloon is then deflated to a smaller profile to allow the catheter to be withdrawn from the patient's vasculature. Problems associated with the above procedure include formation of intimal flaps or torn arterial linings which can collapse and occlude the blood conduit after the balloon is deflated. Moreover, thrombosis and restenosis of the artery may develop over several months after the procedure, which may require another angioplasty procedure or a surgical by-pass operation. To reduce the partial or total occlusion of the artery by the collapse of the arterial lining and to reduce the chance of thrombosis or restenosis, a stent is implanted in the artery to keep the artery open. Drug delivery stents have reduced the incidence of in-stent restenosis (ISR) after PCI (see, e.g., Serruys, P.W., et al., J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 39:393-399 (2002)), which has plagued interventional cardiology for more than a decade. However, a few challenges remain in the art of drug delivery stents. For example, compromised coating integrity when an amorphous bioabsorbable polymer is used for coating a stent, which can result from the conditions of ethylene oxide (ETO) sterilization or from the conditions of crimping a stent onto the delivery balloon. Conditions such as elevated temperature, high relative humidity, and high concentration of ETO in the ETO sterilization process can result in plasticization and adhesion of the coating to the balloon via polymer deformation and flow. In a similar way a completely amorphous bioabsorbable polymer may flow when crimped at elevated temperatures on to the delivery balloon. The embodiments of the present invention address the above-identified needs and issues. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an implantable device.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention provides an implantable device. The implantable device comprises a coating comprising a layer comprising a terpolymer. The terpolymer comprises caprolactone, glycolide and a third monomere, which terpolymer has a molar composition where caprolactone is about 20% or higher, and glycolide is about 10% or higher. In some embodiments, the third monomer is a lactide, e.g., D,L-lactide, L-lactide, or racemic-D,L-lactide. In some embodiments, optionally with one or any combination of features of the various embodiments above or below, the terpolymer has a glass transition temperature (Tg) less than 37 °C. In some embodiments, optionally with one or any combination of features of the various embodiments above or below, the the coating maintains its integrity after ethylene oxide (ETO) sterilization or e-beam treatment. In some embodiments, optionally with one or any combination of features of the various embodiments above or below, the coating can have various thickness. In some embodiments, the coating has a thickness of about 5 microns or less and a degradation or absorption rate that within a period of 6 months after deployment of the implantable device, the coating has a mass loss of about 80% or more. In some embodiments, optionally with one or any combination of features of the various embodiments above or below, the coating can comprises a primer comprising a biodegradable amorphous polymer. A coating including these layers has improved coating integrity while maintaining mechanical integrity after EtO sterilization. In addition, the amorphous polymer can have a rate of degradation or absorption faster or slower than the reservoir layer, and thus, the length of the time of bioabsorption of a coating comprising the layer comprising the terpolymer comprising caprolactone and glycolide and a primer layer comprising an amorphous layer can be tailored by the difference of rate of absorption of the amorphous primer layer and the semi-crystalline layer. Generally, a coating described herein can degrade or absorb at a rate that the coating will have about 80% or more mass loss within a period of 6 months after deployment (e.g., implanted in a blood vessel of a patient). In some embodiments, the coating mass loss within the same period can be about 90% or more, 95% or more, or about 99% or more. In some embodiments, the coating can substantially or completely degrade within about 24 months, within about 18 months, within about 12 months, without about 9 months, within about 6 months, within about 4 months, within about 3 months, within about 2 months, or within about 1 month after implantation of a medical device comprising the coating. In some embodiments, the coating can substantially or completely degrade or absorb within about 100 days after deployment. In some embodiments, optionally with one or any combination of features of the various embodiments above or below, the coating can further comprise a bioactive agent and provides a controlled release of the bioactive agent when the implantable device is deployed. Examples of the bioactive agent are paclitaxel, docetaxel, estradiol, 17-beta-estradiol, nitric oxide donors, super oxide dismutases, super oxide dismutase mimics, 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (4-amino-TEMPO), biolimus, tacrolimus, dexamethasone, dexamethasone derivatives, glucocorticoids, rapamycin, rapamycin derivatives, 40-O-(2-hydroxy)ethyl-rapamycin (everolimus), 40-0-(3-hydroxy)propyl-rapamycin, 40-O-[2-(2-hydroxy)ethoxy]ethyl-rapamycin, and 40-O-tetrazole-rapamycin, 40-epi-(N1-tetrazolyl)-rapamycin (ABT-578), temsirolimus, deforolimus, γ-hiridun, clobetasol, pimecrolimus, imatinib mesylate, midostaurin, feno fibrate, prodrugs thereof, co-drugs thereof, and combinations thereof. Some other examples of the bioactive agent include siRNA and/or other oligoneucleotides that inhibit endothelial cell migration. Some further examples of the bioactive agent can also be lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). LPA is a "bioactive" phospholipid able to generate growth factor-like activities in a wide variety of normal and malignant cell types. LPA plays an important role in normal physiological processes such as wound healing, and in vascular tone, vascular integrity, or reproduction. In some embodiments, optionally with one or any combination of features of the various embodiments above or below, the coating a degradation or absorption rate that within a period of about 100 days after deployment of the implantable device, the coating has a mass loss of about 80% or more. In some embodiments, the coating has a mass loss of about 100% within 100 days or 180 days after deployment of the implantable device. In some embodiments, optionally with one or any combination of features of the various embodiments above or below, the implantable device is a stent or a a bioabsorbable stent. The present invention also provides a method of fabricating an implantable device. The method generally comprises forming a coating of the various embodiments described above or below. The amorphous polyester polymer can be selected to be partially or completely miscible with the reservoir layer such that the reservoir layer and the primer layer can have good compatibility. In some embodiments, a miscibility of at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 70%, 90%, or 95% of the primer polymer in the reservoir polymer is selected. In some embodiments, the amorphous polymer for forming the primer layer can be selected to have a glass-transition temperature (Tg) lower than the Tg of the reservoir polymer. As used herein, the term "layer comprising a terpolymer comprising caprolactone and glycolide" is used interchangeably with the term "terpolymer layer", and the term "primer layer comprising an amorphous polymer" is used interchangeably with the term "amorphous primer layer" or "amorphous layer". In some embodiments, the term "terpolymer layer" is sometimes referred to as "reservoir layer", and the term "amorphous primer layer" is sometimes referred to as "primer layer." In some embodiments, the term "domain" can be referred to as "phase." Therefore, the term "crystalline domain" can be referred to as "crystalline phase." Similarly, the term "amorphous domain" can be referred to as "amorphous phase." As used herein, the term "terpolymer" is used interchangeably with the term "terpolymer comprising caprolactone and glycolide." In some embodiments, the terpolymer comprising caprolactone and glycolide can be a copolymer formed of two or more monomers. In some embodiments, the terpolymer comprising caprolactone and glycolide can be a homopolymer formed of one monomer. In some embodiments, the coating can include one or more other biocompatible polymers, which are described below. The implantable device described herein can be formed on an implantable device such as a stent, which can be implanted in a patient to treat, prevent, mitigate, or reduce a vascular medical condition, or to provide a pro-healing effect. In some embodiments, the vascular medical condition or vascular condition is a coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or a peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Some examples of such vascular medical diseases are restenosis and/or atherosclerosis. Some other examples of these conditions include thrombosis, hemorrhage, vascular dissection or perforation, vascular aneurysm, vulnerable plaque, chronic total occlusion, claudication, anastomotic proliferation (for vein and artificial grafts), bile duct obstruction, ureter obstruction, tumor obstruction, or combinations of these. Definitions Wherever applicable, the definitions to some terms used throughout the description of the present invention as provided below shall apply. The terms "biologically degradable" (or "biodegradable"), "biologically erodable" (or "bioerodable"), "biologically absorbable" (or "bioabsorbable"), and "biologically resorbable" (or "bioresorbable"), in reference to polymers and coatings, are used interchangeably and refer to polymers and coatings that are capable of being completely or substantially completely degraded, dissolved, and/or eroded over time when exposed to physiological conditions and can be gradually resorbed, absorbed and/or eliminated by the body, or that can be degraded into fragments that can pass through the kidney membrane of an animal (e.g., a human), e.g., fragments having a molecular weight of about 40,000 Daltons (40 kDa) or less. The process of breaking down and eventual absorption and elimination of the polymer or coating can be caused by, e.g., hydrolysis, metabolic processes, oxidation, enzymatic processes, bulk or surface erosion, and the like. Conversely, a "biostable" polymer or coating refers to a polymer or coating that is not biodegradable. Whenever the reference is made to "biologically degradable," "biologically erodable," "biologically absorbable," and "biologically resorbable" stent coatings or polymers forming such stent coatings, it is understood that after the process of degradation, erosion, absorption, and/or resorption has been completed or substantially completed, no coating or substantially little coating will remain on the stent. Whenever the terms "degradable," "biodegradable," or "biologically degradable" are used in this application, they are intended to broadly include biologically degradable, biologically erodable, biologically absorbable, and biologically resorbable polymers or coatings. "Physiological conditions" refer to conditions to which an implant is exposed within the body of an animal (e.g., a human). Physiological conditions include, but are not limited to, "normal" body temperature for that species of animal (approximately 37 °C for a human) and an aqueous environment of physiologic ionic strength, pH and enzymes. In some cases, the body temperature of a particular animal may be above or below what would be considered "normal" body temperature for that species of animal. For example, the body temperature of a human may be above or below approximately 37 °C in certain cases. The scope of the present invention encompasses such cases where the physiological conditions (e.g., body temperature) of an animal are not considered "normal." In the context of a blood-contacting implantable device, a "prohealing" drug or agent refers to a drug or agent that has the property that it promotes or enhances re-endothelialization of arterial lumen to promote healing of the vascular tissue. As used herein, a "co-drug" is a drug that is administered concurrently or sequentially with another drug to achieve a particular pharmacological effect. The effect may be general or specific. The co-drug may exert an effect different from that of the other drug, or it may promote, enhance or potentiate the effect of the other drug. As used herein, the term "prodrug" refers to an agent rendered less active by a chemical or biological moiety, which metabolizes into or undergoes in vivo hydrolysis to form a drug or an active ingredient thereof. The term "prodrug" can be used interchangeably with terms such as "proagent", "latentiated drugs", "bioreversible derivatives", and "congeners". N.J. Harper, Drug latentiation, Prog Drug Res., 4: 221-294 (1962); E.B. Roche, Design of Biopharmaceutical Properties through Prodrugs and Analogs, Washington, DC: American Pharmaceutical Association (1977); A.A. Sinkula and S.H. Yalkowsky, Rationale for design of biologically reversible drug derivatives: prodrugs, J. Pharm. Sci., 64: 181-210 (1975). Use of the term "prodrug" usually implies a covalent link between a drug and a chemical moiety, though some authors also use it to characterize some forms of salts of the active drug molecule. Although there is no strict universal definition of a prodrug itself, and the definition may vary from author to author, prodrugs can generally be defined as pharmacologically less active chemical derivatives that can be converted in vivo, enzymatically or nonenzymatically, to the active, or more active, drug molecules that exert a therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic effect. Sinkula and Yalkowsky, above; V.J. Stella et al., Prodrugs: Do they have advantages in clinical practice?, Drugs, 29: 455-473 (1985). The terms "polymer" and "polymeric" refer to compounds that are the product of a polymerization reaction. These terms are inclusive of homopolymers (i.e., polymers obtained by polymerizing one type of monomer), copolymers (i.e., polymers obtained by polymerizing two or more different types of monomers), terpolymers, etc., including random, alternating, block, graft, dendritic, crosslinked and any other variations thereof. As used herein, the term "implantable" refers to the attribute of being implantable in a mammal (e.g., a human being or patient) that meets the mechanical, physical, chemical, biological, and pharmacological requirements of a device provided by laws and regulations of a governmental agency (e.g., the U.S. FDA) such that the device is safe and effective for use as indicated by the device. As used herein, an "implantable device" may be any suitable substrate that can be implanted in a human or non-human animal. Examples of implantable devices include, but are not limited to, self-expandable stents, balloon-expandable stents, coronary stents, peripheral stents, stent-grafts, catheters, other expandable tubular devices for various bodily lumen or orifices, grafts, vascular grafts, arterio-venous grafts, by-pass grafts, pacemakers and defibrillators, leads and electrodes for the preceding, artificial heart valves, anastomotic clips, arterial closure devices, patent foramen ovale closure devices, cerebrospinal fluid shunts, and particles (e.g., drug-eluting particles, microparticles and nanoparticles). The stents may be intended for any vessel in the body, including neurological, carotid, vein graft, coronary, aortic, renal, iliac, femoral, popliteal vasculature, and urethral passages. An implantable device can be designed for the localized delivery of a therapeutic agent. A medicated implantable device may be constructed in part, e.g., by coating the device with a coating material containing a therapeutic agent. The body of the device may also contain a therapeutic agent. An implantable device can be fabricated with a coating containing partially or completely a biodegradable/bioabsorbable/ bioerodable polymer, a biostable polymer, or a combination thereof. An implantable device itself can also be fabricated partially or completely from a biodegradable/bioabsorbable/ bioerodable polymer, a biostable polymer, or a combination thereof. As used herein, a material that is described as a layer or a film (e.g., a coating) "disposed over" an indicated substrate (e.g., an implantable device) refers to, e.g., a coating of the material deposited directly or indirectly over at least a portion of the surface of the substrate. Direct depositing means that the coating is applied directly to the exposed surface of the substrate. Indirect depositing means that the coating is applied to an intervening layer that has been deposited directly or indirectly over the substrate. In some embodiments, the term a "layer" or a "film" excludes a film or a layer formed on a non-implantable device. In the context of a stent, "delivery" refers to introducing and transporting the stent through a bodily lumen to a region, such as a lesion, in a vessel that requires treatment. "Deployment" corresponds to the expanding of the stent within the lumen at the treatment region. Delivery and deployment of a stent are accomplished by positioning the stent about one end of a catheter, inserting the end of the catheter through the skin into a bodily lumen, advancing the catheter in the bodily lumen to a desired treatment location, expanding the stent at the treatment location, and removing the catheter from the lumen. Terpolymer composition The terpolymer described herein can have different contents of caprolactone (A), glycolide (B), and a third monomer (C). The terpolymer can be expressed in this general formula AxByCz, wherein x, y and z are ratios of A, B, and C, respectively. Within the terpolymer, monomers A, B, and C can have any sequence of arrangement, for example, ABC, BAC, CBA, ACB, ABAC, ABBC, BABC, BAAC, BACC, CBCA, CBBA, CBAA, ABACA, ABACB, ABACC, BABCA, BABCB, BABCC, etc. As outlined in some embodiments, a sequence of monomers or units can have more than one units of a monomer, which are described in more detail below. Terpolymers with different contents of these three monomers have different properties with regard to, e.g., rate of degradation, mechanical properties, drug permeability, water permeability, and drug release rate, depending on a particular composition of the monomers in the terpolymer. The terpolymer can have a composition having caprolactone in a molar ratio of about 20% or higher and a glycolide in a molar ratio of about 10% or higher. Therefore, the terpolymer can have the third monomer in a molar ratio of about 70% or lower. In some embodiments, this terpolymer can have a third monomer such as a lactide, e.g., D-lactide, L-lactide, D,L-lactide, racemic-D,L-lactide. In some embodiments, the terpolymer can have a Tg below about 37 °C. Ratios of units from the caprolactone, glycolide and the third monomers can vary, forming a terpolymer having different properties, e.g., different degradation rates, different rates of release of a drug from a coating formed of the terpolymer, different drug permeability, different flexibility or mechanical properties. For example, the glycolide provides an accelerated or enhanced degradation of the terpolymer, the lactide monomer, if present as the third monomer, provides mechanical strength to the terpolymer, and the caprolactone monomer can lower the Tg of the terpolymer and enhance drug permeability, water permeability, and enhancing degradation rate of the polymer, imparting greater flexibility and elongation, and improving mechanical properties of a coating formed of the terpolymer. In some embodiments, the ratio of the various monomers can vary along the chain of the terpolymer. In such a terpolymer, one point of the chain of polymer can be heavy with one monomer while another point of the chain can be light with the same monomer, for example. If a monofunctional initiator is used, and if the selected monomers have highly different reactivity ratios, then a gradient of composition is generated as the monomers are consumed during the polymerization. In another methodology, such a terpolymer can be prepared by so-called gradient polymerization wherein during the polymerization a first or second monomer is progressively added to the reactor containing all, or a portion of, the first monomer. (Matyjaszewski K. and Davis T.P. eds. Handbook of Radical Polymerization, John Wiley & Sons, 2002, p. 789). Yet a third method is by introducing blocks of various ratios of the monomers into the chain of the terpolymer. In some embodiments, the terpolymer described herein can be used to build one or more blocks in combination with other blocks such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) or other blocks of biodegradable or biodurable polymers described below. Randomness of the terpolymer described herein can be measured by randomness index. Generally, a perfectly alternating co-polymer would have a degree of randomness of 1. Conversely, in some embodiments, the terpolymer can include all the repeating units of the monomers in three blocks, the lactide block, the glycolide block, and the block of the third, low Tg monomer. Such a terpolymer would have a degree of randomness of 0. These are known as block copolymers. In some other embodiments, the terpolymer can have a degree of randomness ranging from above 0 to below 1, for example, about 0.01, about 0.02, about 0.05, about 0.1, about 0.2, about 0.25, about 0.3, about 0.35, about 0.4, about 0.45, about 0.5, about 0.55, about 0.6, about 0.65, about 0.7, about 0.75, about 0.8, about 0.85, about 0.9, about 0.95, or about 0.99. Generally, for a crystalline domain to develop, one usually needs a pentad (i.e. the same 5 repeat units or monomers in sequence). Therefore, in some embodiments, one factor to control the randomness of the terpolymer is to keep the repeat units or monomers in sequence in the terpolymer below 5, e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4. Randomness in a polymer can be readily determined by established techniques in the art. One such technique is NMR analysis ((see, e.g., J. Kasperczyk, Polymer, 37(2):201-203 (1996); Mangkorn Srisa-ard, et al., Polym Int., 50:891-896 (2001)). Randomness of an amorphous terpolymer can be readily controlled or varied using techniques known in the art. For example, randomness in a batch reactor is controlled by polymerization temperature and type of solvent where the monomer reactivity ratios will change. For continuous reactors, it will also depend on monomer feed ratios and temperature. Secondarily, there is also a pressure effect on reactivity ratios. Monomers relative reactivity is also important, so you can control it by selecting monomers with similar or different reactivity. Amorphous Polymers The amorphous primer layer can be formed of any one or more amorphous polymer(s). In some embodiments, the amorphous polymer is an amorphous polyester polymer. Some examples of amorphous polyesters include, but are not limited to: amorphous poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLA);amorphous poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide) (PLLLA) with D,L-lactide content of about 30 molar % or above;amorphous poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PDLGA) with glycolide content of about 10 to about 50 molar %;amorphous poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLLGA) with L-lactide content of about 70 molar % or below;amorphous poly(glycolide-co-caprolactone) (PGACL) with glycolide content of about 70 molar % or below;amorphous poly(D,L-lactide-co-caprolactone) (PDLACL) with caprolactone content of about 70 molar % or below;amorphous poly(L-lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLLACL) with L-lactide content of below 70 molar % but above 30 molar %;amorphous copolymers of trimethylene carbonate with glycolide, D,L-lactide, and/or L-lactide; andamorphous PDLGA-CL and PLLA-GA-CL terpolymers with content of L-lactide of about 65 molar % or below. The amorphous polymers can have different molecular weights. In some embodiments, the amorphous polymers listed above can have a weight average molecular weight (Mw) between about 75K Daltons to about 200K Daltons. The primer polymer can be selected to degrade more slowly than the reservoir layer. In some embodiments, it can be selected to degrade or absorb faster than the reservoir layer. In some embodiments, the primer layer can degrade or absorb completely or substantially completely within about 6 months after deployment. In some embodiments, the amorphous polymer can be subjected to degradation modulation to bring the overall coating degradation or absorption rate within a desired range. One example of such modulating the degradation or absorption rate of the amorphous polymer is to subject the polymer to E-beam or gamma irradiation treatment, which is a procedure well known in the art. As used herein, the term "substantially completely" shall mean about 20% or less than 20% by weight of polymer residue remains. In some embodiments, the term shall mean less than about 10 % by weight of polymer residue remains. In some further embodiments, the term shall mean less than 5 % or 1 % by weight of polymer residue remains. Biologically Active Agents In some embodiments, the implantable device described herein can optionally include at least one biologically active ("bioactive") agent. The at least one bioactive agent can include any substance capable of exerting a therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic effect for a patient. Examples of suitable bioactive agents include, but are not limited to, synthetic inorganic and organic compounds, proteins and peptides, polysaccharides and other sugars, lipids, and DNA and RNA nucleic acid sequences having therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic activities. Nucleic acid sequences include genes, antisense molecules that bind to complementary DNA to inhibit transcription, and ribozymes. Some other examples of other bioactive agents include antibodies, receptor ligands, enzymes, adhesion peptides, blood clotting factors, inhibitors or clot dissolving agents such as streptokinase and tissue plasminogen activator, antigens for immunization, hormones and growth factors, oligonucleotides such as antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes and retroviral vectors for use in gene therapy. The bioactive agents could be designed, e.g., to inhibit the activity of vascular smooth muscle cells. They could be directed at inhibiting abnormal or inappropriate migration and/or proliferation of smooth muscle cells to inhibit restenosis. In certain embodiments, optionally in combination with one or more other embodiments described herein, the implantable device can include at least one biologically active agent selected from antiproliferative, antineoplastic, antimitotic, anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, anticoagulant, antifibrin, antithrombin, antibiotic, antiallergic and antioxidant substances. An antiproliferative agent can be a natural proteineous agent such as a cytotoxin or a synthetic molecule. Examples of antiproliferative substances include, but are not limited to, actinomycin D or derivatives and analogs thereof (manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich, or COSMEGEN available from Merck) (synonyms of actinomycin D include dactinomycin, actinomycin IV, actinomycin I1, actinomycin X1, and actinomycin C1); all taxoids such as taxols, docetaxel, and paclitaxel and derivatives thereof; all olimus drugs such as macrolide antibiotics, rapamycin, everolimus, structural derivatives and functional analogues of rapamycin, structural derivatives and functional analogues of everolimus, FKBP-12 mediated mTOR inhibitors, biolimus, perfenidone, prodrugs thereof, co-drugs thereof, and combinations thereof.

A "prohealing" drug or agent, in the context of a blood-contacting implantable device, refers to a drug or agent that has the property that it promotes or enhances re-endothelialization of arterial lumen to promote healing of the vascular tissue. The portion(s) of an implantable device (e.g., a stent) containing a prohealing drug or agent can attract, bind and eventually become encapsulated by endothelial cells (e.g., endothelial progenitor cells). The attraction, binding, and encapsulation of the cells will reduce or prevent the formation of emboli or thrombi due to the loss of the mechanical properties that could occur if the stent was insufficiently encapsulated. The enhanced re-endothelialization can promote the endothelialization at a rate faster than the loss of mechanical properties of the stent. The prohealing drug or agent can be dispersed in the body of the bioabsorbable polymer substrate or scaffolding. The prohealing drug or agent can also be dispersed within a bioabsorbable polymer coating over a surface of an implantable device (e.g., a stent). "Endothelial progenitor cells" refer to primitive cells made in the bone marrow that can enter the bloodstream and go to areas of blood vessel injury to help repair the damage. Endothelial progenitor cells circulate in adult human peripheral blood and are mobilized from bone marrow by cytokines, growth factors, and ischemic conditions. Vascular injury is repaired by both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis mechanisms. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells contribute to repair of injured blood vessels mainly via a vasculogenesis mechanism. In some embodiments, the prohealing drug or agent can be an endothelial cell (EDC)-binding agent. In certain embodiments, the EDC-binding agent can be a protein, peptide or antibody, which can be, e.g., one of collagen type 1, a 23 peptide fragment known as single chain Fv fragment (scFv A5), a junction membrane protein vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, and combinations thereof. Collagen type 1, when bound to osteopontin, has been shown to promote adhesion of endothelial cells and modulate their viability by the down regulation of apoptotic pathways. S.M. Martin, et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res., 70A:10-19 (2004). Endothelial cells can be selectively targeted (for the targeted delivery of immunoliposomes) using scFv A5. T. Volkel, et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1663:158-166 (2004). Junction membrane protein vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin has been shown to bind to endothelial cells and down regulate apoptosis of the endothelial cells. R. Spagnuolo, et al., Blood, 103:3005-3012 (2004). In a particular embodiment, the EDC-binding agent can be the active fragment of osteopontin, (Asp-Val-Asp-Val-Pro-Asp-Gly-Asp-Ser-Leu-Ala-Try-Gly). Other EDC-binding agents include, but are not limited to, EPC (epithelial cell) antibodies, RGD peptide sequences, RGD mimetics, and combinations thereof. In further embodiments, the prohealing drug or agent can be a substance or agent that attracts and binds endothelial progenitor cells. Representative substances or agents that attract and bind endothelial progenitor cells include antibodies such as CD-34, CD-133 and vegf type 2 receptor. An agent that attracts and binds endothelial progenitor cells can include a polymer having nitric oxide donor groups. The foregoing biologically active agents are listed by way of example and are not meant to be limiting. Other biologically active agents that are currently available or that may be developed in the future are equally applicable. In a more specific embodiment, optionally in combination with one or more other embodiments described herein, the implantable device of the invention comprises at least one biologically active agent selected from paclitaxel, docetaxel, estradiol, nitric oxide donors, super oxide dismutases, super oxide dismutase mimics, 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (4-amino-TEMPO), tacrolimus, dexamethasone, dexamethasone derivatives, glucocorticoids, rapamycin, rapamycin derivatives, 40-0-(2-hydroxy)ethyl-rapamycin (everolimus), 40-O-(2-ethoxy)ethyl-rapamycin (biolimus), 40-O-(3-hydroxy)propyl-rapamycin, 40-O-[2-(2-hydroxy)ethoxy]ethyl-rapamycin, 40-O-tetrazole-rapamycin, 40-epi-(N1-tetrazolyl)-rapamycin (zotarolimus), temsirolimus, deforolimus, pimecrolimus, imatinib mesylate, midostaurin, clobetasol, progenitor cell-capturing antibodies, prohealing drugs, prodrugs thereof, co-drugs thereof, and a combination thereof. In a particular embodiment, the bioactive agent is everolimus. In another specific embodiment, the bioactive agent is clobetasol. An alternative class of drugs would be p-para-α-agonists for increased lipid transportation, examples include fenofibrate. In some embodiments, optionally in combination with one or more other embodiments described herein, the at least one biologically active agent specifically cannot be one or more of any of the bioactive drugs or agents described herein. Coating construct According to some embodiments of the invention, optionally in combination with one or more other embodiments described herein, a coating disposed over an implantable device (e.g., a stent) can include a terpolymer comprising caprolactone and glycolide in the reservoir layer and an amorphous polymer in the primer layer described herein in a layer according to any design of a coating. The coating can be a multi-layer structure that includes at least one primer layer, which is layer (1) described below, and at least one reservoir layer, which is layer (2) described below, and can include any of the following (3), (4) and (5) layers or combination thereof: (1) a primer layer;(2) a reservoir layer (also referred to "matrix layer" or "drug matrix"), which can be a drug-polymer layer including at least one polymer (drug-polymer layer) or, alternatively, a polymer-free drug layer;(3) a release control layer (also referred to as a "rate-limiting layer");(4) a topcoat layer; and/or(5) a finishing coat layer. In some embodiments, a coating of the invention can include two or more reservoir layers described above, each of which can include a bioactive agent described herein. Each layer of a coating can be disposed over the implantable device (e.g., a stent) by dissolving the terpolymer comprising caprolactone and glycolide, optionally with one or more other polymers, in a solvent, or a mixture of solvents, and disposing the resulting coating solution over the stent by spraying or immersing the stent in the solution. After the solution has been disposed over the stent, the coating is dried by allowing the solvent to evaporate. The process of drying can be accelerated if the drying is conducted at an elevated temperature. The complete stent coating can be optionally annealed at a temperature between about 40 °C and about 150 °C for a period of time between about 5 minutes and about 60 minutes, if desired, to allow for crystallization of the polymer coating, and/or to improve the thermodynamic stability of the coating. To incorporate a bioactive agent (e.g., a drug) into the reservoir layer, the drug can be combined with the polymer solution that is disposed over the implantable device as described above. Alternatively, if it is desirable a polymer-free reservoir can be made. To fabricate a polymer-free reservoir, the drug can be dissolved in a suitable solvent or mixture of solvents, and the resulting drug solution can be disposed over the implantable device (e.g., stent) by spraying or immersing the stent in the drug-containing solution. Instead of introducing a drug via a solution, the drug can be introduced as a colloid system, such as a suspension in an appropriate solvent phase. To make the suspension, the drug can be dispersed in the solvent phase using conventional techniques used in colloid chemistry. Depending on a variety of factors, e.g., the nature of the drug, those having ordinary skill in the art can select the solvent to form the solvent phase of the suspension, as well as the quantity of the drug to be dispersed in the solvent phase. Optionally, a surfactant can be added to stabilize the suspension. The suspension can be mixed with a polymer solution and the mixture can be disposed over the stent as described above. Alternatively, the drug suspension can be disposed over the stent without being mixed with the polymer solution. The drug-polymer layer can be applied indirectly over at least a portion of the stent surface to serve as a reservoir for at least one bioactive agent (e.g., drug) that is incorporated into the reservoir layer over at least a portion of the primer layer. The primer layer can be applied between the stent and the reservoir to improve the adhesion of the drug-polymer layer to the stent. The optional topcoat layer can be applied over at least a portion of the reservoir layer and serves as a rate-limiting membrane that helps to control the rate of release of the drug. In one embodiment, the topcoat layer can be essentially free from any bioactive agents or drugs. If the topcoat layer is used, the optional finishing coat layer can be applied over at least a portion of the topcoat layer for further control of the drug-release rate and for improving the biocompatibility of the coating. Without the topcoat layer, the finishing coat layer can be deposited directly on the reservoir layer. Sterilization of a coated medical device generally involves a process for inactivation of micropathogens. Such processes are well known in the art. A few examples are e-beam, ETO sterilization, autoclaving, and gamma irradiation. Most, if not all, of these processes can involve an elevated temperature. For example, ETO sterilization of a coated stent generally involves heating above 50°C at humidity levels reaching up to 100% for periods of a few hours up to 24 hours. A typical EtO cycle would have the temperature in the enclosed chamber to reach as high as above 50°C within the first 3-4 hours then and fluctuate between 40°C to 50°C for 17-18 hours while the humidity would reach the peak at 100% and maintain above 80% during the fluctuation time of the cycle. The process of the release of a drug from a coating having both topcoat and finishing coat layers includes at least three steps. First, the drug is absorbed by the polymer of the topcoat layer at the drug-polymer layer/topcoat layer interface. Next, the drug diffuses through the topcoat layer using the void volume between the macromolecules of the topcoat layer polymer as pathways for migration. Next, the drug arrives at the topcoat layer/finishing layer interface. Finally, the drug diffuses through the finishing coat layer in a similar fashion, arrives at the outer surface of the finishing coat layer, and desorbs from the outer surface. At this point, the drug is released into the blood vessel or surrounding tissue. Consequently, a combination of the topcoat and finishing coat layers, if used, can serve as a rate-limiting barrier. The drug can be released by virtue of the degradation, dissolution, and/or erosion of the layer(s) forming the coating, or via migration of the drug through the terpolymer comprising caprolactone and glycolideic layer(s) into a blood vessel or tissue. In one embodiment, except for the primer layer, any or all of other layers of the stent coating can be made of a terpolymer comprising caprolactone and glycolide described herein, optionally having the properties of being biologically degradable/erodable/absorbable/resorbable, non-degradable/biostable polymer, or a combination thereof. In another embodiment, except for the reservoir layer, any or all of other layers of the stent coating can be made of an amorphous polymer described herein, optionally having the properties of being biologically degradable/erodable/absorbable/resorbable, non-degradable/biostable polymer, or a combination thereof. If a finishing coat layer is not used, the topcoat layer can be the outermost layer and can be made of a terpolymer comprising caprolactone and glycolide and/or an amorphous polymer described herein and optionally having the properties of being biodegradable or, biostable, or being mixed with an amorphous polymer. In this case, the remaining layers (i.e., the primer and the reservoir layer) optionally can also be fabricated of a terpolymer comprising caprolactone and glycolide described herein and optionally having the properties of being biodegradable or, biostable, or being mixed with an amorphous polymer The polymer(s) in a particular layer may be the same as or different than those in any of the other layers, as long as the outside of another bioabsorbable should preferably also be bioabsorbable and degrade at a similar or faster relative to the inner layer. If neither a finishing coat layer nor a topcoat layer is used, the stent coating could have only two layers - the primer and the reservoir. In such a case, the reservoir is the outermost layer of the stent coating and should be made of a terpolymer comprising caprolactone and glycolide described herein and optionally having the properties of being biodegradable or, biostable, or being mixed with an amorphous polymer. The primer layer is fabricated of an amorphous polymer described herein and optionally one or more biodegradable polymer(s), biostable polymer(s), or a combination thereof. Any layer of a coating, except for the primer layer, can contain any amount of a terpolymer comprising caprolactone and glycolide described herein and optionally having the properties of being biodegradable or, biostable.

Any layer of a stent coating can also contain any amount of a non-degradable polymer, or a blend of more than one such polymer as long as it is not mixed with a bioabsorbable polymer or any layer underneath the non-degradable layer comprise a bioabsorbable polymer. Non-limiting examples of non-degradable polymers include poly(methylmethacrylate), poly(ethylmethacrylate), poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(2-ethylhexylmethacrylate), poly(laurylmethacrylate), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), polyethylene glycol (PEG) acrylate, PEG methacrylate, 2-methacryloyloxyethylphosphorylcholine (MPC) and poly(n-vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(methacrylic acid), poly(acrylic acid), poly(hydroxypropyl methacrylate), poly(hydroxypropylmethacrylamide), poly(3-trimethylsilylpropyl methacrylate), and copolymers thereof.

In a specific embodiment, the implantable device is a stent. EXAMPLES The following non-limiting examples illustrate the various embodiments described above. Coatings comprising various compositions of terpolymer of caprolactone, glycolide, and lactide were coated on stents using a solvent of acetone/MIBK (90/10). Coatings were evaluated in a porcine coronary model using 10% overstretch. The absorption of the polymer were characterized at 28, 60, and 90 days and showed a nearly complete absorption at the final time point. The everolimus formulation evaluated had a D:P=1:3 using the PLLA-GACL 60/15/25 copolymer. Figure 1 shows that the polymer mass was decreased by 80 % within 60 days and that no polymer was detected on the stent at the 3 month timepoint. Studies on drug release profile of coatings formed of PDLA-GA-CL 60/15/25 with various drug to polymer ratio formulations were performed. Table 1 summarizes drug release for PDLA-GA-CL (60/15/25) with various D:P ratios after cold e-beam sterilization. The stents were formulated from acetone/MIBK (90/10). The coating integrity after ebeam sterilization (1 pass, 25 kGy) showed smooth surface on both inner and outer surfaces (Figure 3). Table 1.
