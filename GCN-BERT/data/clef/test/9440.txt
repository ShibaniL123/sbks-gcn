COMPOSITION AND METHODS OF TREATING VIRAL INFECTIONS AND VIRAL INDUCED TUMORS Ernest Randall Lanier, George R, Painter Related Applications This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) of United States Provisional Patent Application Serial Number 63/230,931, filed August 3, 2009, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Field of the Invention The present invention generally relates to compounds, analogues thereof and methods for treating viral infections and virally induced tumors. Background of the Invention Cancers are the result of a disruption of the normal restraints on cellular proliferation. Cancer causes about 13% of all human deaths. According to the American Cancer Society, 7.6 million people died from cancer in the world during 2007 alone. An important cause for cancer is viral infection. It is estimated that viruses are responsible for 15% of human cancers worldwide. Viral infections appear to be the second most important risk factor for cancer development in humans, exceeded only by tobacco usage. The main viruses associated with human cancers are human papillomavirus, hepatitis Β and hepatitis C virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human T-lymphotropic virus. In addition, patients with immunodeficiency are particularly vulnerable to opportunistic viruses such as polyomavirus (e.g. ΒΚ virus or JC virus). Some recent studies have showed that there may a connection between polyomavirus and cancer. (See Feng et al., Science, vol. 39, 1096-1100 (Feb. 2008) and Moens et al., Cell. Mol. Life Sci... 64, 1656-1678 (2007)). Other research also show that there is a connection between cytomegalovirus and colonic pseudotumor and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), (See Jesus et al., J. Neurooncol, 94:445-448 (2009), Mitechell, et al., Neurooncology, page 10-18 (Feb, 2008), Epstien-Barr virus and gastric cancer, (See Truong et al., J. of Experimental & Clinical Cancer Research 2009, 28:14), human papilloma virus and cervical cancer (See Schifftnan et al, Seminar, Vol. 37, pages 890-907, September 8, 2007, which is available at http: www.thelancet.com).

Certain bisphosphonate compounds have the ability to inhibit squalene synthase and to reduce serum cholesterol levels in mammals, including man. Examples of these bisphosphonates are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,441,946 and 5,563,128 to Pauls et al. Phosphonate derivatives of lipophilic amines, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Analogs of these squalene synthase inhibiting compounds according to the invention, and their use in the treatment of lipid disorders in humans are within the scope of the present invention. Bisphosphonates of the invention may be used orally or topically to prevent or treat periodontal disease as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,270,365, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the active compounds have a phosphonate ester formed by a covalent linking of an antiviral compound selected from the group consisting of cidofovir, adefovir, cyclic cidofovir and tenofovir, to an alcohol selected from the group consisting of an alkylglycerol, alkylpropanediol, 1-S-alkylthioglycerol, alkoxyalkanoi or alkylethanediol, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In some embodiments, the active compounds comprise an antiviral nucleoside compound, wherein the 5'-hydroxyl group has been substituted for a phosphonate or methyl phosphonate that is covalently linked to an alkylethanediol. Certain compounds of the invention possess one or more chiral centers, e.g. in the sugar moieties, and may thus exist in optically active forms. Likewise, when the compounds contain an alkenyl group or an unsaturated alkyl or acyl moiety there exists the possibility of cis- and transisomeric forms of the compounds. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms can be present in a substituent group such as an alkyl group. The R- and S-isomers and mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures as well as mixtures of cis- and trans-isomers are contemplated by this invention. All such isomers as well as mixtures thereof are intended to be included in the invention. If a particular stereoisomer is desired, it can be prepared by methods well known in the art by using stereospecific reactions with starting materials that contain the asymmetric centers and are already resolved or, alternatively, by methods that lead to mixtures of the stereoisomers and resolution by known methods. In cases where compounds are sufficiently basic or acidic to form stable non toxic acid or base salts, administration of the compound as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be appropriate. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are salts that retain the desired biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological effects. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases and acids. Suitable salts include those derived from alkali metals such as potassium and sodium; alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium; or derive from ammonium, ammonium salts with organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine and N-methyl-D-glucamine, among numerous other acids well known in the pharmaceutical ait. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts are selected from organic acid addition salts formed with acids, which form a physiological acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartar ate. succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, a-ketoglutarate, and a-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts. Exemplary agent that may be used to form the salt include, but are not limited to, (1) acid such as inorganic acid, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid; or organic acid for example, acetic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, alginic acid, gluconic acid, gentisic acid, hippuric acid, benzoic acid, maleic acid, tannic acid, L-mandelic acid, orotic acid, oxalic acid, saccharin, succinic acid, L-tartaric acid, ascorbic acid, palmitic acid, polyglutamic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, naphthalenedisulfonic acid, polygalacturonic acid, (2) bases such as ammonia, mono or di-substituted ammonia, alkali metal bases such as potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide; alkaline earth bases such as magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide; organic bases such as larginine, diethylamine, diethylaminoethanol, dicyclohexylamine, ethylenediamine, imidazole, Llysine, 2-hydiOxyethylmorpholine, N-methyl-glucamine, potassium methanolate, zinc tert-butoxide. Active compounds as described herein can be prepared in accordance with known procedures, or variations thereof that will be apparent to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Painter et ah, Evaluation of Hexadecyloxypropyl-9-i?-[2-(Phosphonomethoxy)Propyl]-Adenine, CMX157, as a Potential Treatment for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 and Hepatitis Β Virus Infections, Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 51, 3505-3509 (2007) and US Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0003516 to Almond et al. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for example calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be made. Β. Synthesis of active compounds The process to be utilized in the preparation of the compounds described herein depends upon the specific compound desired. Such factors as the selection of the specific substituent and various possible locations of the specific substituent all play a role in the path to be followed in the preparation of the specific compounds of this invention. Those factors are readily recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art. In general, the compounds of this invention may be prepared by standard techniques known in the art and by known processes analogous thereto. General methods for preparing compounds of the present invention are set forth below. In the following description, all variables are, unless otherwise noted, as defined in the formulas described herein. The following non-limiting descriptions illustrate the general methodologies that may be used to obtain the compounds described herein. Compounds (or "prodrugs") useful in the invention can be prepared in a variety of ways, as generally depicted in Schemes I -VI of US Patent No. 6,716,825. The general phosphonate esterification methods described below are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting this invention in any manner. Indeed, several methods have been developed for direct condensation of phosphonic acids with alcohols (see, for example, R, C. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH, New York, 1989, ρ. 966 and references cited therein). Isolation and purification of the compounds and intermediates described in the examples can be effected, if desired, by any suitable separation or purification procedure such as, for example, filtration, extraction, crystallization, flash column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, distillation or a combination of these procedures. Specific illustrations of suitable separation and isolation procedures are in the examples below. Other equivalent separation and isolation procedures can of course, also be used. Scheme I of US Patent No. 6,716,825 outlines a synthesis of bisphosphonate prodrugs that contain a primary amino group, such as pamidronate or alendronate. Example 1 therein provides conditions for a synthesis of 1-0-hexadecyloxypropyl-alendronate (HDP-alendronate) or 1-0-hexadecyloxypropyl-pamidronate (HDP-pamidronate). In this process, a mixture of dimethyl 4-phthalimidobutanoyl phosphonate (lb, prepared as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,039,819)) and hexadecyloxypropyl methyl phosphite (2) in pyridine solution is treated with triethylamine to yield bisphosphonate tetraester 3b which is purified by silica gel chromatography. Intermediate 2 is obtained by transesterification of diphenyl phosphite as described in Kers, A., Kers, I., Stawinski, J,, Sobkowski, Μ., Kraszewski, A. Synthesis, April 1995, 427 430. Thus, diphenyl phosphite in pyridine solution is first treated with hexadecyloxypropan-1 -ol, then with methanol to provide compound 2. An important aspect of the process is that other long chain alcohols may be used in place of hexadecyloxypropan-l-ol to generate the various compounds of this invention. Treatment of intermediate 3b with bromotrimethylsilane in acetonitrile cleaves the methyl esters selectively to yield monoester 4b. Treatment of 4b with hydrazine in a mixed solvent system (20% methanol /80% 1, 4-dioxane) results in removal of the phthalimido protecting group as shown. The desired alendronate prodrug is collected by filtration and converted to the triammonium salt by treatment with methanolic ammonia. Scheme II of US Patent No. 6,716,825 illustrates a synthesis of analogs of bisphosphonates lacking a primary amino group, in this case the process steps are similar to those of Scheme 1 except that protection with a phthalimido group and subsequent deprotection by hydrazinolysis are unnecessary. Bisphosphonates having 1-amino groups, such as amino-olpadronate, maybe converted to analogs according to the invention prodrugs using a slightly modified process shown in Scheme 111 of US Patent No. 6,716,825. Treatment of a mixture of compound 2 and 3-(dimethylamino)propionitrile with dry HC1 followed by addition of dimethyl phosphite affords tetraester 3 which, after demethylation with bromotrimethylsilane, yields hexadecyloxypropyl-aminoolpadronate. Scheme IV of US Patent No. 6,716,825 illustrates synthesis of a bisphosphonate analog where the lipid group is attached to a primary amino group of the parent compound rather than as a phosphonate ester. Scheme V of US Patent No. 6,716,825 illustrates a general synthesis of alkylglycerol or alkyipropanediol analogs of cidofovir, cyclic cidofovir, and other phosphonates. Treatment of 2, 3-isopropylidene glycerol, 1, with NaH in dimethylformamide followed by reaction with an alkyl methanesulfonate yields the alkyl ether, 2. Removal of the isopropyl idene group by treatment with acetic acid followed by reaction with trityl chloride in pyridine yields the intermediate 3. Alkylation of intermediate 3 with an alkyl halide results in compound 4. Removal of the trityl group with 80% aqueous acetic acid affords the O, O-dialkyl glycerol, 5. Bromination of compound 5 followed by reaction with the sodium salt of cyclic cidofovir or other phosphonate-containing nucleotide yields the desired phosphonate adduct, 7, Ring-opening of the cyclic adduct is accomplished by reaction with aqueous sodium hydroxide. The compound of propanediol species may be synthesized by substituting l-O-alkylpropane-3-ol for compound 5 in Scheme V. The tenofovir and adefovir analogs may be synthesized by substituting these nucleotide phosphonates for cCDV in reaction (f) of Scheme V. Similarly, other nucleotide phosphonates of the invention may be formed in this manner. Scheme VI of US Patent No. 6,716,825 illustrates a general method for the synthesis of nucleotide phosphonates of the invention using 1-O-hexadecyloxypropyl-adefovir as the example. The nucleotide phosphonate (5 mmol) is suspended in dry pyridine and an alkoxyalkanol or alkylglycerol derivative (6 mmol) and 1, 3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimde (DCC, 10 mmol) are added. The mixture is heated to reflux and stirred vigorously until the condensation reaction is complete as monitored by thin-layer chromatography. The mixture is then cooled and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure and the residues adsorbed on silica gel and purified by flash column chromatography (elution with approx. 9:1 dichloromethane/methanol) to yield the corresponding phosphonate monoester. Scheme VII (which is referenced as Figure 1 in Kern et al., AAC 46 (4):991) illustrates the synthesis for alkoxyalkyl analogs of cidofovir (CDV) and cyclic cidofovir (cCDV). In Figure 1, the arrows indicate the following reagents: (a) Ν, Ν -dicyclohexylmorphoiinocarboxamide, Ν,Νdicyclohexylcarbodiimide, pyridine, 100°C; (b) l-bromo-3-octadecyloxyethane (ODE), or l-bromo-3-hexadecyloxypropane (HDP), Ν, Ar-dimcthy lformamid e. 80°C; (c) 0.5 MNaOH. One skilled in the art should be able to convert the salt disclosed in the application to free acid by using any applicable methods known to one skilled in the art. Scheme 1. ΝΗ, As described herein, compounds of the invention may optionally be substituted with one or more substituents, such as are illustrated generally above, or as exemplified by particular classes, subclasses, and species of the invention. In general, the term “substituted” refers to the replacement of hydrogen radicals in a given structure with the radical of a specified substituent. Unless otherwise indicated, a substituted group may have a substituent at each substitutable position of the group, and when more than one position in any given structure may be substituted with more than one substituent selected from a specified group, the substituent may be either the same or different at every position. Combinations of substituents envisioned by this invention may be those that result in the formation of stable or chemically feasible compounds. C.

The invention accordingly provides pharmaceutical formulations for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of the above-mentioned human or veterinary conditions. Pharmacokinetic enhancers. The compounds of the invention may be employed in combination with pharmacokinetic enhancers (sometimes also referred to as "booster agents"). One aspect of the invention provides the use of an effective amount of an enhancer to enhance or "boost" the pharmacokinetics of a compound of the invention. An effective amount of an enhancer, for example, the amount required to enhance an active compound or additional active compound of the invention, is the amount necessary to improve the pharmacokinetic profile or activity of the compound when compared to its profile when used alone. The compound possesses a better efficacious pharmacokinetic profile than it would without the addition of the enhancer. The amount of pharmacokinetic enhancer used to enhance the potency of the compound is, preferably, subtherapeutic (e.g., dosages below the amount of booster agent conventionally used for therapeutically treating infection in a patient). An enhancing dose for the compounds of the invention is subtherapeutic for treating infection, yet high enough to effect modulation of the metabolism of the compounds of the invention, such that their exposure in a patient is boosted by increased bioavailability, increased blood levels, increased half life, increased time to peak plasma concentration, increased/faster inhibition of HIV integrase, RT or protease and/or reduced systematic clearance. One example of a pharmacokinetic enhancer is RITONAVIR™ (Abbott Laboratories). Combinations. As noted above, the compositions of the present invention can include the active compounds as described in section A above in combination with one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3) immunosuppressant agents such as described in section Ε below, in analogous manner as known in the • art.

I ANTIVIRAL ACTIVITY OF CMX001 AGAINST ΒΚ VIRUS In order to test the activity of CMX001 to inhibit replication of ΒΚ virus, stocks of ΒΚ virus were prepared in HFF cells and dilutions of the vims stocks were used to infect primary human renal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs). CMX001 were then added to the wells containing the infected cells and the plates were incubated for 5 days. Total DNA was prepared from the plates and viral DNA was quantified by qPCR. The in vitro activity of CMX001 against ΒΚ vims replication is shown in Table 1. CMX001 exhibited good activity against ΒΚ vims in RPTECs. The activity of CMXOOlwas more potent than cidofovir (.See Table 1). The negative control drug, ganciclovir, was essentially inactive. The assay optimization in the cell line also revealed that the multiplicity of infection appeared to impact the efficacy of cidofovir and CMX001. Table 1.

CMX0U1 inhibits polyomavirus ΒΚ replication in primary human renal tubular cells A. MATERIALS AND METHODS Primary human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs), BKV(Dunlop) and all methods as previously described by Bernhoff et al (See Bernhoff et al, Cidofovir inhibits polyomavirus ΒΚ replication in human renal tubular cells downstream of viral early gene expression, Am J Transplant 8, 1413-1422 (2008).) Only one exception, quantitative PCR (qPCR) to quantify intracellular or extracellular BKV DNA load was performed with a different primer/probe set also targeting the LTag gene (See Hirsch, et al.,,/. Prospective study of polyomavirus type ΒΚ replication and nephropathy in renal-transplant recipients, Ν Engl J Med., 347, 488-496 (2002)). Before each experiment, CMX001 was freshly dissolved to 1 mg/ml in methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide (50/50/2). It was further diluted in RPTEC growth medium. Β. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS (1) Determination of inhibitory concentration IC90 To investigate the effect of CMX001 on BKV progeny, increasing concentrations of CMX001 were added 2 h p.i. and supernatants harvested at 72 h p.i. It was observed that CMX001 reduced the extracellular BKV load in a concentration dependent manner (See Figure 1 a). When viral input was subtracted, CMX001 0.31 μΜ reduced the BKV load by an average of 90% defining the inhibitory concentration ICt>0- Immunofluorescence staining 72 h p.i. of BKV-infected RPTECs demonstrated decreasing numbers of BKV-infected cells with increasing CMX001 concentration (Figure 1 b). With CMX001 0.3 luM an approximately 60% decrease in BKV agnoprotein expressing cells was seen. The number of cells expressing LTag was less reduced but the signal intensity was lower than in untreated cells. With 2.5 uM CMX001 only few cells were positive for agnoprotein and LTag expression but the total number of cells in the well appeared to be reduced. With 5 uM CMX001 only few weakly LTag stained cells but no agnoprotein expressing cells were observed with a more pronounced effect on total cell number. With 10 uM CMX001 no BKV-infected cell was observed and the total cell number was even more reduced. The conclusion is that CMX001 reduced the expression of early and late BKV proteins and the production of extracellular progeny but also seemed to affect the proliferation rate of RPTECs at higher concentrations. (2) Effects of CMX001 on RPTECs (DNA replication and metabolic activity) Inspection of RPTECs by phase contrast microscopy did not reveal any signs of impaired viability during the 3 day exposure to CMX001 0.31 μΜ. To use more sensitive assays, host cell DNA replication and metabolic activity using BrdU incorporation and WST-1 assays in uninfected RPTECs were used. Addition of CMX001 reduced both DNA replication (Figure 2a) and metabolic activity (Figure 2b) of uninfected RPTECs in a concentration-dependent manner. Compared to untreated RPTECs, CMX001 at 0.08 to 10 μΜ decreased DNA replication by 15% to 93% and the metabolic activity by 41% to 88%, respectively. At the concentration of 0.31 μΜ which caused a 90% inhibition of BKV replication, it is observed an approximately 20% reduction in BrdU incorporation and WST-1 activity. (3) Effect of CMX001 on BKV genome replication To investigate whether the BKV genome replication was affected by CMX001, intracellular BKV load at 24-72 h p.i. by qPCR was measured. The intracellular BKV load was normalized to the cell number using the aspartoacylase (ACY) gene as described (See Bernhoff et αℓ., 2008; Randhawa, et al.;Quantitation of DNA of polyomaviruses ΒΚ and JC in human kidneys. J Infect Dis., 192, 504-509(2005)). Compared to untreated RPTECs, CMX001 0.31 μΜ reduced the intracellular BKV load by 94% at 48 h and 63% at 72 h p.i. (Figure 3). Then, a significant inhibitory effect of CMX001 on intracellular BKV genome replication, which is the second step of the BKV lifecycle may be identified. This step is known to require LTag expression which also increases viral late gene expression by two mechanisms: 1. increasing the DNA templates for late gene transcription and 2. by activating transcription from the late promoter (Cole, C. Ν., Polyomavirinae: The Viruses and Their Replication. In Fields Virology, Third edn, ρρ, 1997-2043. Edited by Β. Ν, Fields, D. Μ. Knipe & Ρ. Η. Howley. New York: Lippincott-Raven (1996).) (4) CMXOOl's effects on BKV early and late gene expression To investigate expression of LTag at the single-cell level, immunofluorescence staining at 48 and 72h p.i was performed. At 48 h p.i. the number of BKV positive cells was almost tire same in CMX001 and untreated wells. At 72 h p.i., the CMX001 treated cells seemed to express less LTag pro cell (Figure 4a). When late protein expression at 48 and 72 h p.i was examined by immunofluorescence staining, a significant reduction of agnoprotein (Figure 4a) and VP1 (data not shown) was observed in CMX001-treated RPTECs. By western blotting the decrease of VP1 was found to be 86% and 63% at 48 and 72 h p.i., respectively (Figure 4b) while LTag staining was found to be 33% and 30% reduced at 48 and 72 h p.i,, respectively. Interestingly, immunofluorescence also revealed some refractory cells in the CMX001 treated culture expressing agnoprotein at levels comparable to untreated cells even with CMXOOl concentrations up to 2,5 μΜ. It was concluded that CMX001 significantly reduces late protein expression but also inhibit early protein expression at late time points of infection. (5) Timecourse of CMX001 on extracellular BKV load To examine the effect of CMX001 on BKV progeny over time, supernatants of treated and untreated cells were harvested at the indicated timepoints. As earlier described (Bernhoff el αℓ., 2008), the completion of the first lifecycle of BICV(Dunlop) in untreated RPTECs take between 48 and 72 h. While an increased BKV load was observed in supernatants from untreated cells at 48 h p.i, only input virus could be detected in CMX001 treated cells 48 h p.i. At 72 h an increased viral load was seen in both untreated and CMX001 treated cells but the BKV loads in supernatants from CMX001 treated cells were 84% lower (1.13 χ 10s Geq/ml) than in untreated cells (Figure 5). It is concluded that progeny production in CMX001 heated RPTECs may be delayed. (6) Treatment of RPTECs before infection To investigate whether or not pre-treatment of cells before virus inoculation could inhibit BKV-infection, RPTECs were either treated for 4 hours and CMX001 was replaced by complete growth medium 20 h pre-infection, or cells were treated for 23 hours at 24 h pre-infection but CMX001 was replaced at one hour before infection with complete growth medium. While treatment for 4 hours, ending 20 hours before infection, had hardly any effect on the BKV load 72 h p.i., treatment for 23 hours until one hour before infection did reduce the viral load by about 50% (Figure 6). Thus, CMX001 pre-treatment does reduce but not prevent BKV replication. (7) Stability of CMXOOl To examine the stability of CMXOOl stock solution 1 mg/ml was put in 4 or -20 °C for one week then diluted to 0.31 uM and tested for its antiviral effect by measuring the extracellular BKV load in BKV-infected RPTEC 3 d p.i. Drug stored at 4°C had less than 60% activity while drug stored at -20°C had an approximately 90% activity compared to the freshly prepared drug (Figure 7). C. DISCUSSION The preliminary results from treating BKV-infected RPTECs with CMX001 were shown in Figure 1-7 as well as the above discussion related to Figures 1-7. CMX001 inhibits BKV-infection at the level of BKV genome replication at about 400 times lower concentrations than CDV (CDV 40ug/ml =127uM versus CMX001 0.3 luM). CMX001 at a concentration of 0.31 uM reduced extracellular BKV loads by approximately 90% defining the IC90. The same CMX001 concentration decreased cellular DNA replication in uninfected cells by 22% and metabolic activity by 20%. Flowever, in some previous research (Bemhoff et αℓ., 2008) it is shown that BKV infection increase cellular DNA replication by about 40% and metabolic activity round 20% and therefore the hypothesis is that both DNA replication and metabolic activity will be at the level of uninfected cells when CMX001 0.31 uM is used to treat BKV-infected cells. CMX001 at 0.31 uM reduce BKV DNA replication by 94% at 48 h p.i. At the same time VP1 expression is 86% reduced. However at 72 h p.i., the decrease in DNA replication is only 63%. This discrepancy requires further studies including the effect on infectious supernatants. When extracellular BKV loads were measured at 24, 48, and 72 h p.i., only input was detectable in CMX001 treated cells at 48 h p.i. indicating that very little or no virus is released before 48 h p.i. At 72 h p.i, only a minor increase in the BKV load was observed accounting for a 84% reduction compared to untreated cells. Experiments to examine the effect of pre-treatment of RPTEC with CMX001 prior to infection could prevent BKV replication were conducted and results are shown above. Pre-treatment for 4 h 24 h pre-infection did not inhibit BKV replication. However, pre-treatment for 24 h until one hour before infection reduced the viral load about 50%. Thus pre-treatment of cells will partly inhibit BKV replication. Comparing the immunofluoresence staining of CMX001 IC90 treated cells 72 h p.i and CDV IC90 treated cells (Bemhoff et αℓ., 2008), LT-ag expression 72h p.i, seem to be more reduced by CMX001 than by CDV. As for CDV, treatment refractory cells were present even at CMX001 concentrations 8 times higher than IC90. Since CMX001 does not depend on the organic anion transporter, selective expression of this transporter in the cells can not explain the phenomena. For each CMX001 experiment, fresh stock solutions were prepared. This could lead to minor concentration variation from experiment to experiment. The effect of storing CMX001 stock solutions was therefore tested. Storage of CMX001 at one week at 4°C or at -20°C decreased the antiviral activity. However, the possibility that different activity of the stored and freshly prepared CMX001 could be due to minor concentration differences in the stock ca not be excluded. The conclusion is that the IC90 of CMX001 against ΒΚ virus replication in primary human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells was 0.31 μΜ. In uninfected cells, CMX001 at 0.31 μΜ inhibited metabolic activity and DNA replication by approximately 20%. In addition, CMX001 like CDV inhibits BKV replication in primary human RPTECs downstream of initial LT-ag expression. Probably due to a more favourable uptake, the IC90 for CMX001 in RPTERCS is 410 times lower than for CDV. The host cell toxicity seems to be comparable to CDV. A clear advantage of CMX001 in BKV treatment is the possible oral administration. II. Inhibition of polyomavirus JC replication by CMX001 A. MATERIAL AND METHODS (1) Cell culture COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM-5%. Astrocytes derived from progenitor cells were maintained in MEM-E-10% supplemented with Gentamycin. JCV Mad-4 (ATCC VR-1583) supernatants from infected COS-7 cells with a TCDD50 of 104.5 per ml were used for infection of cultured cells. (2) Infection and CDV-treatment COS-7 or astrocyte cells were infected at a confluence of 60-70% with JCV(Mad-4) at an estimated TCID50 of 0.2. After 2h incubation at 37°C, supernatants were replaced with freshmedium without or with increasing concentration CMX001. CMX001 was freshly dissolved to 1 mg/ml in methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide (50/50/2) and then further diluted the respective growth medium. (3) Transfection of JCV genome Religated JCV Mad-4 DNA was transfected into 50% to 70% confluent COS-7 cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions at a DNA.'Lipid ratio of 0.8:1. (4) Immunofluorescence Cells were fixed with 4% p-formaidehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline, ρΗ6.8 (PBS) at room temperature for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. After washing twice with PBS at room temperature for 5 min, PFA was quenched with 0.5 Μ NF14C1 in PBS at room temperature for 7 min followed washing twice with PBS at room temperature for 5 min. Blocking of unspecific binding sites was done with 3% milk in PBS at 37°C for 15 min. Primary antibody (rabbit anti-VPl 1:300 in 3% milk PBS) was incubated at 37°C for 45-60 min. Cells were washed tiwee with PBS on a shaker at room temperature for 5 min. Secondary antibody (chicken anti-rabbit Cy3 1:2000) and 5 Lig/ml Hochst 33342 dye to stain DNA was given to the cells then incubated at 37°C for 45- 60 min. Cells were washed twice with PBS as before. Coverslips were mounted in NPropylgallat. (5) Realtime PCR JCV loads were quantified after DNA extraction from 100 ul cell culture supernatants and the Corbett X-tractor Gene and the Corbett VX reagents (Qiagen. I Iombrechtikon, Switzerland). The realtime PCR protocol for detection of JCV DNA samples targets the JCV large Τ coding sequence and has been described elsewhere (5). (6) WST-1 assay The metabolic activity was monitored by the colorimetric WST-1 assay (Roche) of the mitochondrial dehydrogenases in viable cells. COS-7 cells were seeded in 96 well plates and CMX001 was added at indicated concentrations. The WST-1 cleavage product was measured at 450 nm (sample) and at 650 nm (background). WST-1 plus medium alone served as blank. (7) BrdU Assay DNA synthesis was quantified by the colorimetric measurement of BrdU incorporation into DNA in proliferating cells using the ‘Cell proliferation ELISA, BrdU5 kit (Roche). COS-7 cells were seeded in 96 well plates and CMX001 was added at indicated concentrations. Absorbance at 450 nm (sample) and at 650 nm (background) was determined 2 h after addition of the substrate. Β. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS (1) Replication of JCV Mad-4 in cell culture The replication characteristics of JCV Mad-4 in COS-7 and astrocyte cell cultures were firstly investigated. At 7 days post-infection (d.p.i.), JCV-infected COS-7 cells were fixed and stained by indirect immunofluorescence. As shown in Fig 8, JCV late viral capsid protein VP1 is detectable as red signal suggesting that JCV is completing the viral life cycle in COS-7 cells (Fig 8, left panel). The counter stain for DNA with Hochst-33342 marked the nuclei in blue (Fig 8, middle panel). Merging both pictures (Fig 8, right panel) indicated that JCV Mad-4 VP1 is present in the nucleus of the infected COS-7 cells. At a higher magnification, the VP1 signal was dispersed throughout the entire nucleus, but sparing the nucleoli (Fig 8, left panel). Cells showing an intense VP1 signal in the nucleus had a diffuse staining pattern in the cytoplasm as well. JCV-infected cells showed enlarged nuclei (Fig 8, middle panel) compared to uninfected cells present in the same cell culture (Fig 8, right panel). The data demonstrate that COS-7 cells are susceptible to JCV Mad-4 infection and that about 30% of ceils have entered the late phase of the JCV lifecycle at 7 d.p.i. Similar experiments infecting astrocyte cells with JCV Mad-4 were performed. At 7 d.p.i, the subcellular distribution of JCV VP1 appeared similar to JCV Mad-4 infected COS-7 cells (Fig 9, left panel, red). The counterstain for DNA with Hochst-33342 marked the astrocyte cell nuclei in blue (Fig 9, middle panel). Merging both pictures indicated that JCV-Mad4 VP1 is present in the nucleus of the infected astrocyte cells. Comparison with the JCV Mad-4infection of COS-7 cells, significantly fewer astrocyte cells were positive for the late protein VP1 (Fig 9, right panel). At higher magnification, the VP1 signal was found mainly in the nucleus sparing the nucleoli and a rather diffuse pattern in the cytoplasm of the astrocyte cells (Fig 9, left panel). Staining of the DNA indicated that large nuclei are present in the culture (Fig 9, middle panel), which belong to JCV-infected cells (Fig 9, right panel). Astrocyte cells were also stained for the viral early protein large T-antigen (LT) as expected, the LT was located in the nuclei of infected cells (data not shown). All cells positive for late protein VP1 also expressed LT, but few astrocyte cells were only positive for LT. This observation indicated that JCV Mad-4 preceded through the polyomavirus life cycle as expected. The confluency at 7 days p.i indicated that astrocytes are slow growing cells and, thus, JCV replication is prolonged compared to BKV replication in human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Our observations suggest that a 7 day growth period is not optimal for efficient JCV replication. Given the slower replication rate of JCV Mad-4 in astrocyte cells, the state of infection at 14 d.p.i. was examined. The results indicated that the number of cells positive for the early LTag (data not shown) and late VP1 had increased by approximately 4-fold (Fig 10). Thus, the astrocyte cells supported JCV Mad-4 replication, but the life cycle seemed to be considerably prolonged compared to the one observed in COS-7 cells. Next, the replication competence of religated JCV Mad-4 DNA transfected into COS-7 cells was tested. This approach would be a helpful tool to perform reverse genetics to test CMX001 efficacy on JCV variants. As shown in Fig 11, JCV late viral capsid protein VP1 is detectable as red signal indicating that JCV is replication competent in COS-7 cells after 7 days post transfection, d.p.t. (Fig 11, left panel). The counterstain with Hochst 33342 dye for DNA marked the nuclei in blue (Fig 11, middle panel). Merging both pictures (Fig 11, right panel) indicated that JCV Mad-4 VP1 is present in the nucleus of the transfected COS-7 cells. At a higher magnification, the VP1 signal was dispersed throughout the entire nucleus, but sparing the nucleoli (Fig 11, left panel). Cells showing an intense VP1 signal in the nucleus had a diffuse staining pattern in the cytoplasm as well, JCV-transfected cells showed enlarged nuclei (Fig 11, middle panel) compared to normal cells present in the same cell culture (Fig 11, right panel). The data demonstrate that COS-7 cells are susceptible to JCV Mad-4 DNA transfection and that about 15% of cells have entered the late phase of the JCV lifecycle by day 7 p.i. After transfection, the subcellular staining pattern for late protein VPlwas identical to the VP1 staining after infection with JCV Mad-4. (2) Determination of inhibitory concentration IC90 To investigate the effect of CMX001 on JCV progeny, increasing concentrations of CMX001 were added at 2 h p.i. and supernatants harvested at 5 d.p.i. It was observed that CMX001 reduced the extracellular JCV load in a concentration dependent manner (Fig 12). Between day 1 and 5 p.i., the viral load increased in untreated cells by about 2.5 log (1.24 χ 107 vs 5.09 χ 109). By contrast, in cells treated with 2,5 μΜ CMX001, it is observed only 2 %- fold increase during the same time period (9.69 χ 106 vs 2.44 χ 107). Substracting the viral input defined as the viral load at day 1 p.i., CMX001 at 0.15 μΜ reduced the JCV viral load by >50% and 0.6 μΜ reduced JCV by >90%, defining the inhibitory concentration IC-50 and IC-90 at day 5 d.p.i., respectively. (3) Effects of CMX001 on COS-7 cell metabolic activity Inspection of COS-7 by phase contrast microscopy did not reveal any signs of impaired viability during the 7 day exposure to CMX001 0.6 μΜ. To use a more sensitive assay, the effects on the cellular metabolic activity using WST-1 assay and BrdU incorporation in uninfected COS-7 cells was investigated.. Addition of CMX001 reduced the metabolic activity (Fig 13) and DNA replication (Fig 14) of uninfected COS-7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Compared to untreated COS-7 cells, increasing CMX001 concentrations from 0.08 to 10 μΜ decreased the metabolic activity from 3% to 52% and DNA replication 83% to 10%, respectively. At 0.6 μΜ, COS-7 cells showed a modest loss of metabolic activity of 17%, an approximately 50% reduced BrdU incorporation. Taken together, CMX001 significantly reduced host cell metabolic activity and DNA replication at higher concentrations. Similar experiments were also conducted with astrocyte cells at CMX001 concentrations of 0,08 to 5 μΜ. DNA replication in uninfected astrocytes decreased by 25% to 92% at the highest CMX001 concentration (data not shown). Comparing the CMX001 associated inhibition of DNA replication both cell types, it seemed that COS-7 were slightly less sensitive (83% vs 92%, respectively). However, for astrocyte cells, the 2 h substrate incubation period of the assay seemed to be not optimal since the optical density was low compared to the readings for COS-7. This is consistent with our observation that astrocyte cells had a slower metabolism compared to COS-7 cells. (4) CMX001 effects on extracellular JCV load in COS-7 To examine the effect of CMX001 on JCV progeny levels over time, supernatants of treated and untreated cells were harvested at the indicated time points. Supernatants at day 1 p.i. were taken as a measure of input virus. In untreated cells, the extracellular JCV load increased by more than 3 fogs over the observation period of 7 days (1.24 χ 107 vs 5.67 χ 1010 geq/ml). hi the presence of 5 μΜ CMX001, it is observed only a modest change in the JCV load of less than 1 log (1.34 χ 107 vs 8.85 χ 107 geq/ml (Fig 15). When JC viral loads were compared for CMX001 5 uM treated cells at 7 d.p.i. with virus progeny in untreated cells at 3 d.p.i., the viral load in the CMX001 treated cells reached only 91% of the (9.72 χ 107 vs 8.85 χ 107 geq/ml). It was concluded that progeny production in CMX001 treated COS-7 cells may be delayed. (5) CMX001 reduces JCV late gene expression To investigate the effect of CMX001 on late gene expression, immunofluorescence staining was performed for JCV VP1. At 7 d.p.i., untreated COS-7 cells were stained for JCV VP1 as comparison (Fig 16, upper panel). Addition of CMX001 at 1.25 μΜ was associated with a significant reduction of JCV VP1 signaly (Fig 16, middle panel). At the highest CMX001 concentration of 5 μΜ, essentially no VP1 positive cells could be observed by immunofluorescense (Fig 16, lower panel). It was concluded that CMX001 significantly reduces JCV late protein expression between 1.25 μΜ and 5 μΜ. (6) CMX001 effects on extracellular JCV load in astrocyte cells To examine the effect of CMX001 on JCV progeny levels over time, supernatants of treated and untreated cells were harvested at the indicated timepoints. To determine input virus samples were taken at 1 d.p.i. In the course of the infection for untreated cells, the extracellular JCV load changes approximately 1 log over the period of 7 days (3.22 χ 107 vs 2.30 χ 108 geq/ml). In the presence of CMX001, JCV load of less than 1 log was seen (1.34 χ 107 vs 8.85 χ 107 geq/ml (Fig 17). It was concluded that JCV replication was significantly slower in astrocyte cells than in COS-7. Despite the tendency of low concentrations of CMX001 to inhibit progeny production, the observation period of 7 days did not allow to measure inhibitoiy effects of CMX001. C DISCUSSION The preliminary results suggest that CMX001 inhibits JCV replication in COS-7 cells. The CMX0Q1 concentration of 0.6 μΜ reduced extracellular JCV loads by approximately 90%. This concentration is 2 orders of magnitude lower than concentrations reported for CDV inhibition, but in the same range as observed for BKV. Here, the CMX001 IC-90 of BKV replication was determined as 0.31 μΜ in primary tubular epithelial cells (34). It was observed that CMX001 decreased the host cell metabolic activity by 17% and DNA replication by about 50%. When extracellular JCV loads were measured from 1 to 7 d.p.i., the JCV load from cells treated with the highest concentration of CMX001 (5 μΜ) was only slightly higher at 5 d.p.i. than input virus at 1 d.p.i. indicating that very little or no virus is released within 4 days. At 7 d.p.i, there was only a minor increase in the JCV load at this concentration, and the level of progeny virus was below the viral load measured at 3 d.p.i. of untreated cells. In astrocyte cells, there is a trend that low concentration of CMX001 might delay the accumulation of progeny virus. However, the inefficient progeny virus production in untreated astrocyte cells 7 d.p.i. demonstrated that the JCV replication cycle is significantly slower. The difference between COS-7 and astrocyte cells is likely due to the transformed phenotype of COS-7 cells including the expression of the SV40 large T-antigen supporting a more efficient replication cycle of JCV. In astrocyte cells, this is considerably slower. The conclusion is that The IC50 and lCg0 values for CMX001 against JC virus replication in vitro in COS-7 cells was 0.15 and 0.6 μΜ, respectively. In uninfected COS-7 cells, the IC50 of CMX001 for metabolic activity and DNA replication was approximately 5 and 0.6 μΜ, respectively. Notably, these cells express polyomavirus Τ antigen may be specifically sensitive to the effects of CMX001. Example 3 Examples of using CMX001 on human patients with EBV-associated intracranial post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) The first patient is a 11-year-old patient with a history of sickle cell anemia developed EBV-associated intracranial post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), EBV was positive in the plasma (7 Dec and 14 Dec 2010) and brain biopsies were consistent with PTLD. hi early December, the patient presented with a 3 day histoiy of persistent headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient was admitted to the hospital and had an acute episode of severe headache with possible seizure activity, A CT of the brain showed a ring-enhancing mass in the right frontal lobe and brain biopsy was consistent with EBV-associated PTLD. The patient was admitted to PICU. High intracranial pressure, repetitive seizures associated with apnea led to intubation and emergency request for CMX001. The use of CMX001 in this patient with EBV-associated PTLD is ongoing since 26 Dec 2009. The patient has tolerated CMX001 well, and continues to receive 4 mg/kg twice weekly. She has had clinical improvement of her signs and symptoms of disease as well as stabilization if not reduction of her intracranial mass. EBV in the plasma remains negative. The second patient was a 6 month old heart transplant recipient with EBV-associated PTLD. The patient acquired a primary EBV infection post-operatively. PET scans showed lesions in the liver, lung, and bone (iliac crest) consistent with PTLD, The clinical condition continued to destabilize with what was presumed to be EBV-associated encephalitis with EBV detected in the CSF, clinical and EEG-correlated seizure activity and decreased responsiveness and changes in mental status. At the time of request for CMX001, the patient was on mechanical ventilation, had evidence of both pneumonia and PTLD of his lungs, evidence of seizure activity' with clinical criteria for encephalopathy being present. The patient received his first dose of CMX001, 20 mg (approximately 3,3mg/kg) on 3 March 2010, and his second dose on 7 March 2010 via NG tube The patient had a significant decline in EBV viral loads from 267,338 copies/mL (3 March 2010) to 47,427 (7 March 2010). The patient continued to show evidence of progressive neurologic injury. The parents withdrew support on the day following his second dose of CMX001. Example 4, I. Non-GLP In Vitro Evaluation of CMX001 Against a Panel of Human Tumor Cell Lines The cell growth inhibitory activities of CMX001, Cidofovir, and a standard agent (varies depending on the tumor type of the cell lines) were evaluated in a panel of cell lines derived from multiple tumor types using a MTS or SRB based cell proliferation assay. The compounds showed varying degrees of inhibitory activity against the cell lines. CMX001 was more potent than its parent compound, Cidofovir, in almost all 24 cell lines evaluated in the study. The IC50 values of CMXOOI in the tumor cell lines ranged from 6.6μΜ to >100pM, which are relatively moderate when compared to those of the standard agents. I MATERIALS AND METHODS (1). Cell lines: The cell lines used in the test are listed in Table 3. Cells were supplied with fresh media every 2-3 days and passed every 3-5 days depending on their growth rates. After 10-15 passages, cells were discarded and a fresh culture was established from frozen stocks. Cell cultures were checked for mycoplasma and other contaminants regularly, Table 3.

Doxorubicin, Docetaxel, Oxaliplatin, DTIC (Dacarbazine) and Cisplatin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Gemcitabine was manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company and purchased from Infusion Solutions Pharmacy (Tucson, ΑΖ). (3) Experimental procedure: In vitro cell proliferation assays were performed using a 96-well plate based MTSassay (CellTiter 96° AqueousOne Solution Cell Proliferation Assay, Promega) or SRB (Suiforhodamine-B) assay (1-3). Briefly, cells were plated in 100μ1 medium on day 0 in 96-well microtiter plates (Falcon #3072), On day 1, 10μ1 of serial dilutions of each compound (Nine 1:2 dilutions with a starting concentration of 100μΜ; in some cases, a starting concentration of 400μΜ (CMX001 or Cidofovir) or 1μΜ (some standard agents)) were added in triplicates to the plates. For standard agents using DMSO as solvent, serial dilutions of DMSO with a starting concentration of 0.5% were also included as a vehicle control. After incubation for 3 days at 37°C in a humidified incubator, viable cells were measured either by MTS or SRB assay. For MTS assay, 20μ1 of a 20: 1 mixture of (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS, 2mg/ml) and an electron coupling reagent, phenazine methosulfate (PMS, 0.92mg/ml in DPBS), was added to each well and incubated for 3 hours at 37°C. Absorbance was measured using a BioTek synergy™ ΗΤ Multiple Detection microplate reader at 490ηΐη. For SRB assay, cells were fixed in situ with 50pL of cold trichloroacetic acid (TCA, final concentration at 10% w/v) for 60 minutes. Cells were then washed 5 times with H20 and air-dried. Next, cells were stained with 20pL of 0,2% SRB in 1% acetic acid and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes and unbound SRB was removed by washing 5 times with 1% acetic acid and air-dried. Finally, bound SRB stain was solubilized in 50μ1, of 50μΜ Tris buffer before taking an optical density measurement at 570ηΐη using the BioTek microplate reader. The growth inhibition data were expressed as the percentage of cell survival calculated from the background corrected absorbance. The surviving fraction of cells was determined by dividing the mean absorbance values of the test agent-treated samples by the mean absorbance values of untreated control. (4) Statistical analysis: Raw data were acquired using a BioTek synergy™ ΗΤ Multiple Detection microplate reader and imported into Microsoft Excel for analysis. The average signal of each treatment was calculated from the triplicates after subtracting the blank signals. The percentage survival values were calculated using the following formula: %survival = (average signal of the drug treatment/average signal of untreated controls) χ100. The data were finally imported into the Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to generate tire dose-activity curves using non-linear regression curve fit and to calculate the IC50 values, Β.

CMX001 was more potent than its parent compound, Cidofovir, in almost all 24 cell lines evaluated in the study. The IC50 values of CMX001 in the tumor cell lines ranged from 6.6μΜ to >100pM, which are relatively moderate when compared to those of the standard agents. Among the 22 tumor cell lines tested, CMX001 was most active in PC-3 (ΚΧο=6.6μΜ) and SK-HEP-1 (IC5o~7.4pM). In general, CMXOOlwas most active in prostate, liver and cervical cancer cell lines, and was least active in kidney, bladder and ovarian cancer cell lines. Interestingly, CMX001 was also fairly active against two immortalized human normal epithelial cell lines, Het-IA (esophagus) and THLE-3 (liver), with an 1C50 of 20.5μΜ and 7.0μΜ, respectively. Both cell lines were immortalized by the SV40 large T-antigen virus (4-5). DTIC (dacarbazine) was not active against the melanoma cell lines (IC5O>100pM). One explanation for this low activity of DTIC in cell proliferation assay is that DTIC requires hepatic activation for its antitumor activity. However, temozolomide, an analog of DTIC which does not require hepatic activation, did not show good activity in these two cell lines either (1C;.;;> 10ϋμΜ, data not shown). Therefore, it could be merely that these two cell lines are resistant to DTIC and temozolomide, as has been shown in some other melanoma cell lines (6-7). The fact that CMX001 showed some activity in these two melanoma cell lines is potentially encouraging. It may be worthwhile to consider studies that look at the influence of duration of exposure with activity. In this regard, longer exposure times may result in enhanced cytotoxicity.
