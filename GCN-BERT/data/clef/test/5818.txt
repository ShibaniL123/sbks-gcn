Example 9-(1-Benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl (S)-2-hydroxy-2-(3-(6-(((1R,3S)-3-(4-((((R)-2-hydroxy-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethyl)amino)methyl)-benzamido)cyclobutyl)carbamoyl)pyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)-2-phenylacetate (Compound 9)
Step 1: tert-Butyl ((trans)-3-(6-chloropyrazine-2-carboxamido)cyclobutyl)carbamate
A stirred solution of 6-chloropyrazine-2-carboxylic acid (0.25 g, 1.58 mmol) in DMF (3 mL) was added with DIPEA (0.42 mL, 2.37 mmol) and HATU (0.72 g, 1.9 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes. A solution of tert-butyl (trans-3-aminocyclobutyl)carbamate (0.32 g, 1.74 mmol) in DMF (3 mL) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and was washed sequentially with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (Ã—2) and brine. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate evaporated at reduced pressure to afford the title compound (0.530 g, 93%).
