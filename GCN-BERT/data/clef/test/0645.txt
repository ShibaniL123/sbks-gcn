and Methods Associated Therewith The present invention claims priority under 35 USC 119(e) Co US Provisional Application No. 61/953,7 1 filed March 15, 2014, the entire contents of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Field of t he I ntion The present invention relates to thiowea/amidrae iimetionaiized tyrosine kinase inhibitors modified with go!d, platinum, and other precious metal compounds. The Chiourea ariudine-modified 3-chloro-4-fluoroaniI.ino-q«ina .oime derivatives were studied as carrier ligands in linear go (l) or square planar platmurn(ii) complexes. "The molecules mimic the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib (by computational docking experiments). Thiourea or amidine groups were either direciiy attached to qiiinazoiine-C'6 or linked to this position via a flexible alkylamino chain. The approach allows the selective targeting of clinically relevant tyrosine kinases with classical anticancer metals as a means of overcoming drug resistance in intractable cancer. The metals introduced may act as electrophiles and form bonds with amino acid residues in the kinases' active sites, such as cysteine, methionine, histidine, and lysine. Background of the invention Mutational! - activated tyrosine kinases (TK) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EOFR) family are considered a major driver of cancer cell survival and aggressive tumor, growth. In non-small cell lung cancer, expression levels of EGFR are inversely correlated with survival of the disease. Somatic (activating) EOFR mutations sensitize cancer cells to small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor's (T is), which target the enzyme's ATP binding site and show potent antiproliferative properties. Gefitinib is a qumazoime-based TKl indicated against cancers harboring aberrant EGFR, in particular lung carcinomas. Unfortunately, the efficacy of this drug is limited b the emergence of acquired resistance as a consequence of a secondary mutation within the ATP binding pocket. One currently pursued approach to combatting this form of resistance observed for mutant EGFR and other clinicall relevant kinases is to turn the reversible TKIs into irreversible inhibitors (ITKIs). These molecules contain a strategically positioned reactive electrophilie group (usually a Michael acceptor), which is able to form a covalent bond with accessible cysteine residues in the active sites of the tareetabte enzymes. i Brief summary o f the fo vea lion hi ail embodiment, the present invention relates to introducing a gold(I) or platmum(Il) based electrophile into a TKI structure tha can be targeted to the solvent- accessible cysteine-7 7 near the entrance to the ATP binding pocket of EGFR-T . These phannacophores would combine the high sulfur affinity of gold(I) or platinura(O) with the selectivity and nanomolar binding affinity of an EGFR-TK-targeted ligand. The use of gold(I) or platimim(ll) as e'lectrophilic moieties in the proposed structures in place of fee Michael acceptor was inspired by the mechanisms of action of goid(l) drugs, which react with (seleno)cysteine residues in proteolytic and redox-active enzymes and the reactivity of platinum drugs with cysteine containing species demonstrated in the inventors' previous research. While these interactions are generally unselective, targeting of specific cysteine residues by goid(I) and platinutn(If) complexes containing target-selective carriers may occur. Thus, in an embodiment the present invention relates to introducing a precious metal electrophile into a TKI structure that: can be targeted to the solvent-accessible cysteine-797 near the entrance to the ATP binding pocket of EGFR-TK. The desired pharmacophore combines the high sulfur affinity of goki(I) and platinum(ll) with the selectivity and nanomolar binding affinity of an EGFR-TK-targeted ligand, in an embodiment, the present invention relates to novel thiourea and araidtne- modified TKls derived from a. quinazo!me scaffold. The present invention also relates to the ability of novel fuiictionali zed TKls to serve as potential carrier l igands in (pseudo)1iali d.e and phosphine substituted goid(I) and mixed-Hgand platinumCH) complexes. At least one TKI derivative was identified that partially overcomes resistance to gefitinib in NSCLC ceil lines harboring wild-type and mutated EGFR kinase domains. Additionally, two piatinom(Ii) derivatives, P3-T2 and P9-T2, displayed low nanomolar binding affinities to wild-type EGFR, similar to gefitinib Accordingly, in an embodiment, the present invention relates to generating unique types of hybrid pharmacophores-, which, lend themselves to modular high- throughput screening and extended structure-activity relationship studies. Libraries can be assembled using simple ligand substitution chemistry (see for example Scheme 1 ) and metal - facilitated armiie-to-nitri!e addition chemistry (see for example Schemes 4-6). in an embodiment, although the relati vely high IC50 of one deri ative can be explained by its aqueous reactivity, which leads to an uodesired, deactivating auto-cheiation, which does not allow for nucleophile binding and possibly prevents receptor binding, other compounds of the present invention have lower IC'so values. The prototypes P3-T3 and P3- T4 are expected to have tower IC»> values, in one variation, the chemical strategy used to generate these unique types of hybrid pharmacophores bod themselves to modular screening and extended structure-activity relationship studies. Thus, the compounds, compositions and methods of the present invention are likely to add to the useful platinum-based drugs that are currently being used worldwide against genitourinal (bladder, ovaries, testes) cancers and carcinomas of the head and neck, as well as colon cancers. The present compounds, compositions and methods show an altered spectrum of activity compared to the currently available drugs nd show excellent activity in cancers insensitive to the available clinical platinums, as well as the traditional kinase inhibitors.

Detailed description of the invention In an embodiment, the present invention relates to a new class of chemotherapy compositions, compounds and methods aimed towards treating cancer caused by the overexpression and/or mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), specifically non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In an embodiment, the present invention relates to synthetic routes capabl of utilizing EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKis) as scaffolds for precious metal conjugation, leading to .i reversible inhibition of wildtype and .mutant EGF . in cancerous models via a solvent-accessible reactive cvsteme residue in the ATP-binding pocket of the enzyme. The chemical compos itions of these metal -T I hybrid agents are distinct .from those of current reversible and irreversible TKis currently in the clinic and on the market. These new metal-TKl hybrid agents (e.g., gold and platinum) possess the ability to result in decreased systemic toxicity when compared to classical DNA-targeted raetal- based chemotherapy (e.g. dspiathx) b driving the new agents towards proteins i volved in cancer proliferation and survival rather tha towards genomic DMA . Thus, in an embodiment, the present invention may be useful for first- and/or second- line treatment option for cancers that are inherently resistant, or, have become resistant to clinical therapies, especially classical platinum drugs. The present invention may meet the urgent need (hat exists tor mechanistically novel drugs for the life-prolonging/curative treatment of NSCLC. Thus, in an embodiment, the present invention relates to new gold(i) and platihum(.il)~ TK1 hybrid agents capable of utilizing the inherent nanomolar binding affinity of the TKI to create metal -induced irreversible enzyme inhibition, which was only previousl availabie via Mi chael acceptor/donor interaction s - la an embodiment., the present invention also relates to synthetic methodologies capable of producing precious metal-TKl hybrid agents that are able to irreversibly inhibit a wide array of structurally diverse tyrosine kinases with solvent-accessible cysteine or methionine residues in the ATP binding pocket with great specificity. Moreover, in an embodiment, the present invention relates to the design and synthesis of structurally new and previously undi sclosed go!dd) and piaiimun(JI)-TKJ compounds/compositions displaying promising kinase selectivity and biological activity when compared to FDA-approved and widely used gefitinib. In a variation, the present .invention also relates to ne thiourea-contajning kinase inhibitors (TI ) that are capable of overcoming the intrinsic resistance caused by the secondary T790M EGFR. mutation to classical T Is (gefitinib). In an embodiment, the present compounds/compositions containing P3-T2 and/or P - T2 show wiidtype EGFR dissociation constants comparable to gefitinib. in an embodiment, the present invention relates to a new use for anti-cancer metals, allowing them to be repurposed for selective molecularly targeted therapies for the management of resistant forms of cancer. in an embodiment, the present invention relates to a new, selective target for platinom-based chemotherapy. In an embodiment, the present invention uses the platinum and gold-based compounds to target several kinases for cancer chemotherapy, including the ErbB family of enzymes, VEGFR, and FGFR, among others. Small molecule kinase inhibitors often lose their effectiveness in tumors over time as a consequence of secondary mutations that significantly decrease the drag-enzyme binding affinity. The present invention attempts to overcome this type of acquired tumor resistance b introducing irreversible inhibitors thai covalently attach to the ATP binding pocket. The componnds/composuions and methods will serve as kinase inhibitors containing cystetne-binditig metal-based electrophi!es. The compounds feature organic ATP-mimicking scaffolds that bind to the target kinase active site with high affinity and selectivity while the eiectrophilic metal induces a permanent coordinative bond with the amino acid residue to achieve irreversible inhibition. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present: invention presents structure-guided desi n and synthesis of these classes of molecules. Several of the synthesized target molecules showed binding constants ( d) in the low- nanomolar range in competition binding assays and high selectivity for the targeted kinase domain in a panel of 145 wild-type and clinically relevant mutated kinases (KinoraeScan, DiscoverX, Fremont, CA). "The ability of the electrophilic agents to induce irreversible adducts was studied by LC ESI-MS/MS in pepsin digests of kinase incubated with inhibitor. Moreover, the in vitro cytotoxicity of selected derivatives was studied in solid tumor cell lines. The data generated suggest that the new pharmacophores will, likely have applications as therapeutics capable of overcoming acquired tumor resistance by irreversibly inhibiting deregulated kinases. To generate a gold-modified. TKI., an N-heterocycHc quinazolme scaffold was used and the N~(3~chloro~4«fluorophenyl) group from gefitinib (Figure 1 ), which target the adenine bindin site and an adjacent hydrophobic pocket of EGF -TK, respectively. The 6-position of the qutnay.oline C6 ring was chosen as attachment point for a side chain carrying a cysteine-affinic gold(!) moiety, similar in design to relevant Michael acceptor-based ITKls. The goal, of this design was to favor binding of the metal with cysteine- 797 proximal to the kinase's catalytic cleft without compromising the ligand's interactions with the binding pocket. The linkage between the eiectrophile and the TKI may be achieved via formation of a strong An(i)-S bond wit a thiourea residue; a thiol-like donor group previously explored in biologically relevant carrier Iigands of this metal. A docking study was performed to examine the conformational space and receptor binding of thionrea-modified. TKIs. Structures of the gold-free Iigands were geometry optimized using DFT calculations and studied in complex with the EGFR kinase domain (L858R/T790M mutant) (PDB-iD; 2JIV). hi these experiments, a scaffold was identified that produces energetically favorable binding geometries in which the thiourea sulfur of the TKI is positioned in close proximity (4-4.5 A) to the sulfur atom of cysteine-797. This orientation was considered compatible with electrophilic attack of the metal in a corresponding gold(I)-rnodif?ed TKI on the protein thiol. From, the modeling studies, two structures, 4 and 5 (see Scheme 1), emerged, which were considered viable candidates for the desired application.. The two derivatives (and all other deri vatives reported) were synthesized from common intermediate 3, which was generated by installing a 3-chioro-4-fluoroanilino group at the 4-positton of the quinazoline ring in precursor .1 and subsequent reduction of the 6-nitro group in 2 to a 6-araino group. Reaction of 3 with (he appropriate isothiocyanates afforded the ,Ν'-disubstituted iMourea derivatives 4 and 5. Scheme 1 Synthesis of quina¾olitie derivatives.

Attempts to introduce gold(l) e!ectrophiies such as [AoX} (where X :::: CI~ or SCN-) into these structures using the common precursor j AiiXiiht}] (tht :::: tetrahydrothiophene), led to a product that was not isotatable (Scheme 2). Electrospray ionization raass spectra (E SIMS) of these reaction mixtures showed little sign of the desired ligand exchange to produce complexes | A.uX{4,5}], but were consistent with decomposition of 4 and 5 resulting in the analogous eyanamides (loss of H2S, based on (M~34-f-H fragment ions) and gold(i) sulfide. Desulluraiion of {aromatic) N,N '-disubsiituted thioureas has previously been observed in the presence of heavy metals. To circumvent the problem of !igaud desutfuration, an Ν,Ν,Ν '-trisubstituied derivative ? was synthesized from the Nfi-methyiqninazo!ine derivative 6, which was generated from intermediate 3 via reductive animation, in feactioos with [AuX(tht)], compound 7 showed greatly improved Ugand properties and was able to act as a stable sulfur- donor.

This produces a unusual arrangement in which the aromatic moieties of the two bridging ligands are mutually stacked at. van der Waals distance (see Figure 2a). Proton NM'R chemical shift anomalies in conjunction with electrospray mass spectra recorded in positive-ion mode (see Figure 2b) confirm that the dinuclear caiionic structures persist in solution and are not solely a consequence of packing effects in the solid state. Importantly, no reversal of the dinuclear structure was observed, when 12a was incubated under physiologically relevant concentrations in phosphate-buffered saline (containing -140 m.M chloride) for several days ((ddaattaa nnoott sshhoowwnn))..

Cell proliferation assays in two NSCLC cell lines were performed to assess the cell growth inhibitory effects of the newly synthesized Τ Ϊ derivatives 7 and 9 alone and as ligands in complexes 12a, 12b, and 13. For comparison the clinical drug gefitinib was included in the screening. The ceil Ike NCI-H460 is a model of a large-cell carcinoma and i 20 characterized by wild-type EGFR-TK. By contrast, NCl-Hl 975 adenocarcinoma cells harbor a point mutation (L858 ) in exon 21 as well as a secondary mutation CT790M) at the bottom of the hydrophobic ATP binding pocket. Whi l e the former somatic (activating) mutation sensitizes cancer cells to EGFR-TKIs (including gefitinib), the latter causes resistance to these therapies. 25 The resul s of the cell proliferation assays are summarized in Table 1. Both NCI-H46Q (wild-type) and CI-IT1975 (mutated) show the expected resistance to gefitinib with inhibitory concentrations hi the high rnicromolar range, in agreement with previously reported dat (typically, ¾β > it) p [2b]), NCTH46 cells were found to be more sensitive to all of the analogues tested than NCI-Hi 975, except for compound 9. The new analogue 7 30 was the least acti ve compound tested with high- icrornokr IC50 value in a range previously observed for structurally related thionrea-modilled TKls. By contrast, extension of the side chain on carbon-6 of the quinazoiine ring to generate 9 led to a pronounced increase in potency, in particular in NCl-Hl 975, where a cytotoxic enhancement of 30-fold is observed. Most notably, compound 9 partially overcomes the acquired resistance against gefitinib S observed in this cancer model. The low-micromolar inhibitory concentration detemiined for compound 9 in. resistant NCI-HI.975 compares favorably with tbe bjgh-nanomolar/low- micromolar activity typically observed for gefiiinib in. sensitive NSCLC models. Modification of compounds 7 and 9 with { AuX} and {Au(PEt;)F groups, respectively, had only a minor effect on the inhibitory concentrations, with compound 13 maintaining low- rnicromolar activity in both cell Hues.

(piVI) were extracted from drug-response curves for two experiments performed in triplicate for each concentration. Using simple !igand substitution chemistry, which has been previously developed to generate mixed ihiourea-(pseudo)halldo and iiiiourea-phosphme goid(I) complexes, a sulfur- modified TKJ derived from gefiiinib was introduced as a ligand. Compound 9 alone showed significantly better activity than gefiiinib in a T Jkesistant cancer cell line. This observation suggests thai the newl introduced thiourea-containing side chain may enhance the binding affinity of the classical TKI structure with the enzyme's active site. In the lowest-energy model generated for compound 9 in complex with EGFR-TK (L858 /T7 0M mutant) the tluourea-modifted side chain is located in the hydrophihe region of the protein cleft produced by the bilobal kinase Ibid, (see Supplementary Information). This orientation, positions the i ourea-NH group in close hydrogen-bonding distance to residues Asn-842 and Asp-855, which may promote strong binding to the EGFR-TK domain. The goal of turning compound 9 into a goid(I)-modified TKI was to further enhance the biological activ ity of the TKI by promoting reaction of cysteine- 797 of the EGFR-TK with a targeted metal-based electrophile. Potential binding mechanisms of such a pharamcophore may involve cross-link formation between the protein and the ligand in the ATP binding pocket of the TKI, or complete transfer of the gold moiety from the TKI to tire amino-acid sulfur (Scheme 3). Both types of irreversible modification have the potential to help overcome resistance mediated b reduced TKI binding affinity in the T790M mutant as a consequence of secondary mutations in the active site of the kinase. Unfortunately, unlike thiourea sulfur in compound 7, the corresponding side chain in 9, while confcrcnationaliy more flexible, appears to adopt an unfavorable orientation for this application (St¾0,iK;i-— Scy* * 9 A). The ability of compound 9 to act as a targeted carrier of ( Au(PEt¾)] r would also depend on the stability of the mixed thiourea-phosphine coordination in compound 13 in the presence of competing nucleophiies. These include sulfur-containing proteins in circulation and in the eytosol Thiourea as a donor was chosen .for its relative ease of synthesis and for its ihioi-like properties and ability to compete with thiolate sulfur in gold(J) coordination. Alternati ve gold-affniic iigands remain to be tested as part of a broader effort to establish structure-activity relationships in gold-modified EGFR-TKis. Scheme 3. Potential reactions of go!d(I) with cysteine sulfur hi the ATP binding site of EGFR-TK via gold(i) transfer (left side pathway) of g ki(i)-raediated cross-link formation (right side pathway). The same concept applies to derivatives containing plaiinum(ll) and other metals. While the intention of the current design was to hijack gold into the ATP-binding pocket of the tyrosine kinase, a potential mechanism by which complex 13 disassembles into a gokl~phosphhie species and analogue 9 in the presence of reactive bio iigands prior to reaching the enzyme active site has also to be considered. Gold(I>-phosphmes directly target the mitochondria to trigger oxidative stress which leads to apoptosis. Aberrant EGFR expression is associated with defective mitochondrial apoptotic signaling., which renders affected cancer cells insensitive to conventional chemotherapy. Thus, a dual mechanism promoted by the individual components that involves inhibition of EGFR signaling and cell, death triggered by mitochondrial toxicity may help overcome tumor resistance. Derivative 9 showed promising activity in the ceil proliferation assay, but attachment of the gold electrophiie in .13 did not result in the desired enhancement in cell kill. One possible explanation for this observation would be that, the [Au(PEt, 3+ group, while not compromising the binding affinity of the T l moiety with the receptor, may be positioned unfavorably for reaction with the sulfur atom of cysteine-797. It is also possible that cytotoxic gold-phospbine species generated from complex 13 may not significantly contribute to the cell kill in the two cancer models, which, ma be dominated by TK inhibition.

[22] Prior to docking studies, structures were checked in AutoDockTools 1.5.4 (The Scripps Research institute, La Joila, CA) for possible bond torsion errors, and appropriate Gasteiger charges were calculated and assigned as necessary. The crystal structure of EGFR (L858R T790M mutant) from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 2J1V) was used as the 3-D receptor structure for docking studies, and the active site coordination ranges were defined using the grid box in AutoDockTools.

Scheme 5i> P3-T4 Scheme 6 ίί should be noted that for the reactions in schemes 4-6, the outcome products of the reactions can be varied by var ing the temperatures with either the nitrite substitution product or the nitrite addition product as the major component (for an example, see scheme 5b). In one embodiment, the design using metal-based electrophiles has a fundamental advantage over Michael-acceptor-based inhibitors (suc as afatmib): with the latter structures only active-site cysteine residues can be effectively targeted. In contrast, platinum forms stable bonds with many other ammo-acid residues, such as methionine, histidine, and lysine, as well as nitrogen of the peptide backbone, in addition, in one embodiment, the present design can be tailored for use with other kinases. This includes enzymes involved in the escape mechanisms that confer resistance to EGF (e.g. FGFRl) and kinases that cannot be targeted with current irreversible drugs because their active sites do not have targetable cysteines.
