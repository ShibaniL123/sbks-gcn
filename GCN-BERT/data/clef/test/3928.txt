WO 2006/097191 CA 02599207 2007-08-27 PCT/EP2006/001823 HAIR AND/OR SCALP CARE COMPOSITIONS INCORPORATING FLAVONOTD COMPOUNDS i0 This invention relates to hair and/or scalp care compositions incorporating certain selected flavonoid compounds. The invention also relates to the use of these flavonoid compounds for the treatment and/or prevention of inflammatory skin conditions such as the scalp skin itching and flaking associated with dandruff. Background It is widely believed that Malassezia yeasts, such as Malassezia furfur, are the main cause of dandruff. However, it is unclear why some people suffer from this condition while others do not. What is known is that increasing the level of Malassezia on the scalp does not automatically lead to dandruff. This suggests that Malassezia is necessary but not sufficient to cause the condition. Recent studies have demonstrated that dandruff is associated with changes in scalp skin condition. Dandruff scalp skin has been shown to have decreased levels of stratum corneum lipids such as ceramides, an increased susceptibility to application of topical histamine and a perturbed balance in the levels of inflammatory cytosine markers in the stratum corneum. These findings clearly demonstrate that dandruff is associated with changes in scalp skin condition and that dandruff is multifactorial. It is believed that the weakened scalp skin barrier and perturbed condition of the scalp skin renders an individual susceptible to challenge by factors such as Malassezia. WO 2006/097191 CA 02599207 2007-08-27 PCT/EP2006/001823 The main, if not only, intervention strategy used on the market currently for the treatment of dandruff is the topical application of antifungals such as zinc pyrithione (ZnPTO), octopirox and ketoconazole which are normally delivered from a shampoo. These antifungal agents remove (or at least reduce the level of) the Malassezia from the scalp, and provide effective treatment of the dandruff condition. Although clinically proven to be effective in treating the clinical symptoms of dandruff over a two to four week period, there remains a need to treat the main symptoms of dandruff more effectively and rapidly. The main symptoms of dandruff are visible skin flakes in the hair and on the shoulders and scalp itch. Scalp itch is perceived as being a particular problem in certain parts of the world, for example it is the main symptom of dandruff in China, SouthEast Asia and India. As well as treating the clinical signs of dandruff, therefore, there remains a need for providing rapid relief from scalp itch for dandruff sufferers. WO04/00085 describes how cannabinoid receptor (CBR) activators may be useful in hair treatment compositions for the treatment and/or prevention of symptoms of dandruff such as scalp skin itching and flaking. The present inventors have found that certain selected flavonoid compounds are capable of acting as CBR activators, and therefore may be used for the treatment and/or WO 2006/097191 CA 02599207 2007-08-27 PCT/EP2006/001823 prevention of symptoms of dandruff such as scalp skin itching and flaking. i0 There is no suggestion in W004/00085 that flavonoid compounds (of which over 5,000 have been chemically isolated and reported) would possess such activity. Furthermore it has been observed that the selected flavonoid compounds of the invention are significantly more hydrophilic (with a ClogP < 4.5) than those compounds which have generally been documented in the literature as exhibiting CBR activation. Summary of the invention According to the invention there is provided a hair and/or scalp care composition comprising a flavonoid compound of general formula (I): (I) R4 0 in which: WO 2006/097191 CA 02599207 2007-08-27 PCT/EP2006/001823 Ri, R3 and R4 are each, independently, -H,-F,-Cl,-Br,-I,-OH, lower alkyl (e.g. COE-6 alkyl) or lower alkoxy (e.g. Ci-6 alkoxy) ; and R2 is -H or an alkenyl group. In another aspect, the invention provides a method of treating and/or preventing inflammatory skin conditions such as the scalp skin itching and flaking associated with dandruff, which method comprises topically applying a composition according to the invention to the hair and/or skin, preferably to the hair and/or scalp. Detailed Description of the Invention and Preferred Embodiments RI in general formula (I) is preferably -H or -OH. R2 in general formula (I) is preferably -H or a CH2 CH=C(CH3 )2 (prenyl) group. R3 and R4 in general formula (1) are preferably independently selected from -OH and -OCH3 . Specific examples of suitable flavonoid compounds of general formula (I) are: a compound which has the structural formula (II) isoxanthohumol or 4',7-dihydroxy-5-methoxy-8prenylflavanone): (termed WO 2006/097191 CA 02599207 2007-08-27 PCT/EP2006/001823 (II) I H H3CO 0 a compound which has the structural formula (III) (termed 8prenylnaringenin or 4',5,7-trihydroxy-8-prenylflavanone): WO 2006/097191 CA 02599207 2007-08-27 PCT/EP2006/001823 (III) HO O a compound which has the structural formula (IV) (termed pinocembrine or 5,7-dihydroxyflavanone): (IV) i0 HO1%%' HO 0 a compound which has the structural formula (V) pinostrobin or 5-hydroxyl-7-methoxyflavanone): (termed WO 2006/097191 CA 02599207 2007-08-27 PCT/EP2006/001823 (v) H3CO HO 0 a compound which has the structural formula (VI) (termed sakuranetin or 5,4'-dihydroxy-7-methoxyflavanone): (Vl) H: H HO 0 Preferred is a compound which has the structural formula (V) (pinostrobin). The inventors have found that this compound can activate both of the two similar, but distinct, types of WO 2006/097191 CA 02599207 2007-08-27 PCT/EP2006/001823 membrane receptor which have been termed Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CBIR) and Cannabinoid Receptor 2 (CB2R) (Matsuda et al, Nature 346, 561-564 (1990), Munro et al, Nature, 365, 61-65 (1993)). CBIR is by far the predominant form in the central nervous system, whereas both CBIR and CB2R are located in the peripheral tissues, including the skin. Herein a reference to a CBR activator includes either or both CBIR and CB2R activators. i0 The above flavonoid compounds of general formula (I) are natural products and may be obtained from suppliers such as Apin Chemicals Limited (Oxon., UK)., Sigma-Aldrich and Interbioscreens. Mixtures of two or more flavonoid compounds of general formula (I) may also be used in compositions of the invention. The amount of flavonoid compound(s) of general formula (I) in the compositions of the invention is preferably selected in the range of from 0.05 to 20%, more preferably from 0.1 to 10%, most preferably from 0.25 to 5wt% by weight based on total weight. Antidandruff Agent Preferably, compositions according to the invention comprise from 0.01% to 30% by weight, more preferably 0.1% to 10%, most preferably 0.5 to 2% by weight of an antidandruff agent. By "antidandruff agent" is meant a different compound from the flavonoid compound of general formula (I). Antidandruff agents are compounds that are active against WO 2006/097191 CA 02599207 2007-08-27 PCT/EP2006/001823 dandruff and are typically antimicrobial agents, preferably antifungal agents. Suitable antidandruff agents include compounds selected from zinc pyrithione, climbazole, ketoconazole, octopirox and mixtures thereof. The preferred antifungal agent is zinc pyrithione (ZnPT0) which, on account of its relative insolubility in aqueous systems, is generally used in hair treatment compositions as a particulate dispersion. The zinc pyrithione may be used in any particle form including, for example, crystalline forms such as platelets and needles and amorphous, regularly or irregularly shaped particles. If zinc pyrithione is present in the composition, a suspending agent is preferably used to prevent or inhibit the settling of the particles out of the composition. The average particle diameter of the zinc pyrithione particles (i.e, their maximum dimension) is typically from about 0.2 to about 50 m, preferably from about 0.4 to about i0 bm, more preferably from 0.4 to l m. Antifungal agents typically display a minimum inhibitory concentration of about 50 mg/ml or less against Malassezia. If the antifungal agent is soluble in aqueous systems, it may be present in solution in a composition used in the invention.

The molecular weight of the polymer will generally be between 5 000 and I0 000 000, typically at least I0 000 and preferably in the range I00 000 to about 2 000 000. The polymers will have cationic nitrogen containing groups such as quaternary ammonium or protonated amino groups, or a mixture thereof. The cationic nitrogen-containing group will generally be present as a substituent on a fraction of the total monomer units of the cationic polymer. Thus when the polymer is not a homopolymer it can contain spacer non-cationic monomer units. Such polymers are described in the CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Directory, 3rd edition. The ratio of the cationic to non-cationic monomer units is selected to give a polymer having a cationic charge density in the required range.

Further Conditioning Agents Hair treatment compositions according to the invention such as shampoos and conditioners suitably contain further conditioning agents such as silicone conditioning agents and non-silicone oily conditioning agents. Suitable silicone conditioning agents include polydiorganosiloxanes, in particular polydimethylsiloxanes which have the CTFA designation dimethicone. Also suitable for use in compositions of the invention (particularly shampoos and conditioners) are polydimethyl siloxanes having hydroxyl end groups, which have the CTFA designation dimethiconol. Also suitable for use in compositions of the invention are silicone gums having a slight degree of crosslinking, as are described for example in WO 96/31188. These materials can impart body, volume and stylability to hair, as well as good wet and dry conditioning. Also suitable are functionalised silicones, particularly amino-functionalised silicones. Suitable non-silicone oily conditioning agents are selected from hydrocarbon oils, fatty esters and mixtures thereof. The further conditioning agent is suitably present in shampoo or conditioner compositions at a level of from 0.05 to I0, preferably from 0.2 to 5, more preferably from about 0.5 to 3 percent by total weight of further conditioning agent based on total weight of the composition. WO 2006/097191 CA 02599207 2007-08-27 PCT/EP2006/001823 Hair treatment compositions of the invention may contain other optional ingredients for enhancing performance and/or consumer acceptability, such as fragrance, dyes and pigments, pH adjusting agents, pearlescers or opacifiers, viscosity modifiers, preservatives, and natural hair nutrients such as botanicals, fruit extracts, sugar derivatives and amino acids. i0 The invention is further illustrated with reference to the following, non-limiting examples, in which all percentages are by weight based on total weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLES Examples 1 to Flavonoid compounds of general formula (I) above were evaluated for their ability to activate Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CBIR) and Cannabinoid Receptor 2 (CB2R). CBIR experiments were performed using membranes from HEK293 cells over-expressing human recombinant CBI, as described by the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer) and using [3H]CP-55,490 as the radioligand. CB2R experiments were performed using membranes from HEK293 cells over-expressing human recombinant CB2 , as described by the manufacturer (Perkin-E!mer), and using [3H]CP-55,495 as the radioligand. WO 2006/097191 CA 02599207 2007-08-27 PCT/EP2006/001823 Data of active compounds are expressed in Ki (mM) and are means±SEM of n=3 determinations. The values that are stated for each of the compounds is an EC50 value. This is defined as the molar concentration of an agonist, which produces 50% of the maximum possible response for that agonist. The values documented are in micromolar units. The absence of a value in the table indicates that greater than 25 micromolar concentration was required for 50% binding of the ligand to the receptor. Also, the ClogP values of the compounds were calculated using SYBYL v6.8 (Tripos Inc., Missouri).
