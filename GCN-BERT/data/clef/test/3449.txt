Step 1.
4-Hydroxyphthalic acid (10.0 g, 55 mmol) was heated under argon at 200° C. for 16 h. After cooling, toluene (100 mL), butylamine (6.9 mL, 70 mmol) and molecular sieves 4A (30 g) were added, and the obtained mixture was heated at reflux for 24 h. The reaction mixture was poured into water (300 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2×300 mL). The extract was washed with water (200 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, and the volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was crystallized from methanol/water (1:1) to give pure 2-butyl-5-hydroxyisoindoline-1,3-dione (7.24 g, 60% yield).
