The present invention relates to novel compounds which modulate the CB2 receptor and said compounds for use as medicaments. Cannabinoids are a group of about 60 distinct compounds found in Cannabis sativa (also know as marijuana) with cannabinol, cannabidiol and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) being the most representative molecules. The therapeutic usage of Cannabis can be dated back to ancient dynasties of China and includes applications for various illnesses ranging from lack of appetite, emesis, cramps, menstrual pain, spasticity to rheumatism. The long history of Cannabis use has led to the development of several pharmaceutical drugs. For example, Marinol and Cesamet which are based on THC and its analogous nabilone, respectively, are used as anti-emetic and appetite stimulant. Despite of the clinical benefits, the therapeutic usage of cannabis is limited by its psychoactive effects including hallucination, addiction and dependence. Mechoulam R, ed. Cannabinoids as Therapeutic Agents, Boca Raton, FL; CRC Press, 1986 provides a review of the medicinal use of cannabis. The physiological effects of cannabinoids are mediated by at least two G-protein coupled receptors, CB1 and CB2. Autoradiographic studies have demonstrated that CB1 receptors are expressed primarily in the central nervous system, specifically in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia and cerebellum. They are also found to a lesser degree in the reproductive system and other peripheral tissues including that of the immune system. CB1 receptors regulate the release of neurotransmitters from the pre-synaptic neurons and are believed to mediate most of the euphoric and other central nervous system effects of cannabis, such as THC-induced ring-catalepsy, hypomobility, and hypothermia, which were found to be completely absent in mice with a deletion of the CB1 gene (Zimmer et al., Increased mortality, hypoactivity, and hypoalgesia in cannabinoid CB1 receptor knockout mice. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. (1999) 96:5780-5785.) CB2 receptors are almost exclusively found in the immune system, with the greatest density in the spleen. It is estimated that the expression level of CB2 in the immune cells is about 10 to 100 times higher than CB1. Within the immune system, CB2 is found in various cell types, includung B cells, NK cells, monocytes, microglial cells, neutrophils, T cells, dentritic cells and mast cells, suggesting that a wide range of immune functions can be regulated through CB2 modulators (Klein et al., The cannabinoid system and immune system. J Leukoc Biol (2003) 74:.486-496). This is supported by the finding that the immunomodulatory effect of THC is absent in CB2 deficient mice mice (Bicklet et al., Immunomodulation by cannabinoid is absent in mice deficient for the cannabinoid CB2 receptor. Eur J Pharmacol (2000) 396:141-149). CB2 selective ligands have been developed and tested for their effects in various imflammatory settings. For example, in animal models of inflammation, CB2 selective agonists, inverse agonists and antagonists have been shown to be effective in suppressing inflammation (Hanus et al., HU-308: a specific agonist for CB(2), a peripheral cannabinoid receptor. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. (1999) 96:14228-14233, Ueda et al., Involvement of cannabinoid CB(2) receptor-mediated response and efficacy of cannabinoid CB(2) receptor inverse agonist, JTE-907, in cutaneous inflammation in mice. Eur J Pharmacol. (2005) 520:164-171 and Smith et al., The anti-inflammatory activities of cannabinoid receptor ligands in mouse peritonitis models Eur J Pharmacol. (2001) 432:107-119.). Furthermore, CB2 selective agonists inhibit disease severity and spasticity in animal models for multiple sclerosis (Baker et al., Cannabinoids control spasticity and tremor in a multiple sclerosis model. Nature (2000) 404:84-87.Arevalo-Martin et al., Therapeutic action of cannabinoids in a murine model of multiple sclerosis J Neurosci. (2003) 23:2511-2516.). Taken together, these results support the notion that CB2 receptor modulators can be employed for the treatment of medical conditions having an inflammatory component. In addition to inflammation, CB2 agonists have been shown to inhibit pain and emesis. For instance, CB2 selective agonists blunt the pain response induced by thermal or other stimuli (Malan et al., CB2 cannabinoid receptor-mediated peripheral antinociception. Pain. (2001) 93:239-45 and Nackley et al., Selective activation of cannabinoid CB(2) receptors suppresses spinal fos protein expression and pain behavior in a rat model of inflammation. Neuroscience (2003) 119:747-57.) CB2 activation has also been demonstrated to inhibit neuropathic pain response (Ibrahim et al., Activation of CB2 cannabinoid receptors by AM1241 inhibits experimental neuropathic pain: pain inhibition by receptors not present in the CNS. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. (2003) 100:10529-33.) Finally, in contrast to the earlier data which did not find CB2 in the brain, a recent article demonstrated the expression of CB2 in the brain, at about 1.5 % of the level in the spleen. CB2 activation is shown by this article to be responsible for the anti-emetic effect of endocannabinoid (Van Sickle et al., Identification and functional characterization of brainstem cannabinoid CB2 receptors. Science. 2005 310:329-332.) The foregoing results confirm that CB2 agonists can be used for the treatment of inflammatory and neuropathic pain as well as emesis. WO2008014199 and WO2008039645 discuss the CB2 receptor and the therapeutic uses of the sulfone derivatives, having CB2 agonist activity, disclosed therein.

A. Human CB1 and CB2 Receptor Binding: Experimental Method: CB2 membranes are purchased and made from HEK293 EBNA cells stably transfected with human CB2 receptor cDNA (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences). CB1 membranes are isolated from HEK cells stably co-transfected with human CB1 receptor and Gα16 cDNA's. The membrane preparation is bound to scintillation beads (Ysi-Poly-L-lysine SPA beads, GE Healthcare) for 4 h at room temperature in assay buffer containing 50mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5mM EDTA, 5mM MgCl2, 0.8% fatty acid free Bovine Serum Albumin. Unbound membrane is removed by washing in assay buffer. Membrane-bead mixture is added to 96-well assay plates in the amounts of 15ug membrane per well (CB2) or 2.5ug per well (CB 1) and 1mg SPA bead per well. Compounds are added to the membrane-bead mixture in dose-response concentrations ranging from 1x 10-5 M to 1x10-10 M with 0.25% DMSO, final. The competition reaction is initiated with the addition of 3H-CP55940 (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences) at a final concentration of 1.5nM (CB2) or 2.5nM (CB1). The reaction is incubated at room temperature for 18 h and read on TopCount NXT plate reader. Total and non-specific binding is determined in the absence and presence of 1.25uM Win 55212 (Sigma). IC50 values for each compound are calculated as the concentration of compound that inhibits the specific binding of the radioactively labeled ligand to the receptor by 50% using the XLFit 4.1 four parameter logistic model. IC50 values are converted to inhibition constant (Ki) values using Cheng-Prusoff equation. B. CB2R mediated modulation of cAMP synthesis: Compounds of the invention are evaluated for their CB2 agonist or inverse agonistic activity in accordance with the following experimental method. Compounds which are shown to bind to CB2 by the binding assay described above but which are not shown to exhibit CB2R-mediated modulation of cAMP synthesis by this assay are presumed to be CB2 antagonists. Experimental Method: CHO cells expressing human CB2R (Euroscreen) are plated at a density of 5000 cells per well in 384 well plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. After removing the media, the cells are treated with test compounds diluted in stimulation buffer containing 1mM IBMX, 0.25% BSA and 10uM Forskolin. The assay is incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. Cells are lysed and the cAMP concentration is measured using DiscoverX -XS cAMP kit, following the manufacturer's protocol. In this setting, agonists will decrease forskolin induced production of cAMP while inverse agonists will further increase forskolin induced production of cAMP. EC50 of agonists are calculated as follows. The maximal amount of cAMP produced by forskolin compared to the level of cAMP inhibited by 1uM CP55940 is defined as 100%. The EC50 value of each test compound is determined as the concentration at which 50% of the forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis is inhibited. Data is analyzed using a four-parameter logistic model. (Model 205 of XLfit 4.0). C. CB1R mediated modulation of cAMP synthesis: Compounds of the invention are evaluated for their CB1 agonist or inverse agonistic activity in accordance with the following experimental method. Compounds which are shown to bind to CB1 by the binding assay described above but which are not shown to exhibit CB1R-mediated modulation of cAMP synthesis by this assay are presumed to be CB1 antagonists. Experimental Method: CHO cells expressing human CB1R (Euroscreen) are plated at a density of 5000 cells per well in 384 well plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. After removing the media, the cells are treated with test compounds diluted in stimulation buffer containing 1mM IBMX, 0.25% BSA and 10uM Forskolin. The assay is incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. Cells are lysed and the cAMP concentration is measured using DiscoverX -XS cAMP kit, following the manufacturer's protocol. In this setting, agonists will decrease forskolin induced production of cAMP while inverse agonists will further increase forskolin induced production of cAMP. EC50 of agonists are calculated as follows. The maximal amount of cAMP produced by forskolin compared to the level of cAMP inhibited by 1uM CP55940 is defined as 100%. The EC50 value of each test compound is determined as the concentration at which 50% of the forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis is inhibited. Data is analyzed using a four-parameter logistic model. (Model 205 of XLfit 4.0).

Some degree of routine dose optimization may be required to determine an optimal dosing level and pattern. The active ingredient may be administered from 1 to 6 times a day. General Administration and Pharmaceutical Compositions When used as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the invention are typically administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Such compositions can be prepared using procedures well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise at least one compound of the invention. The compounds of the invention may also be administered alone or in combination with adjuvants that enhance stability of the compounds of the invention, facilitate administration of pharmaceutical compositions containing them in certain embodiments, provide increased dissolution or dispersion, increased inhibitory activity, provide adjunct therapy, and the like. The compounds according to the invention may be used on their own or in conjunction with other active substances according to the invention, optionally also in conjunction with other pharmacologically active substances. In general, the compounds of this invention are administered in a therapeutically or pharmaceutically effective amount, but may be administered in lower amounts for diagnostic or other purposes. Administration of the compounds of the invention, in pure form or in an appropriate pharmaceutical composition, can be carried out using any of the accepted modes of administration of pharmaceutical compositions. Thus, administration can be, for Example, orally, buccally (e.g., sublingually), nasally, parenterally, topically, transdermally, vaginally, or rectally, in the form of solid, semi-solid, lyophilized powder, or liquid dosage forms, such as, for example, tablets, suppositories, pills, soft elastic and hard gelatin capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, or aerosols, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for simple administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical compositions will generally include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound of the invention as the/an active agent, and, in addition, may include other medicinal agents, pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, diluents, vehicles, or combinations thereof. Such pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers, or additives as well as methods of making pharmaceutical compositions for various modes or administration are well-known to those of skill in the art. The state of the art is evidenced, e.g., by Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, A. Gennaro (ed.), Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2000; Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives, Michael & Irene Ash (eds.), Gower, 1995; Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, A.H. Kibbe (ed.), American Pharmaceutical Ass'n, 2000; H.C. Ansel and N.G. Popovish, Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 5th ed., Lea and Febiger, 1990. As one of skill in the art would expect, the forms of the compounds of the invention utilized in a particular pharmaceutical formulation will be selected (e.g., salts) that possess suitable physical characteristics (e.g., water solubility) that is required for the formulation to be efficacious. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for buccal (sub-lingual) administration include lozenges comprising a compound of the present invention in a flavored base, usually sucrose, and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration comprise sterile aqueous preparations of a compound of the present invention. These preparations are preferably administered intravenously, although administration can also be effected by means of subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal injection. Injectable pharmaceutical formulations are commonly based upon injectable sterile saline, phosphate-buffered saline, oleaginous suspensions, or other injectable carriers known in the art and are generally rendered sterile and isotonic with the blood. The injectable pharmaceutical formulations may therefore be provided as a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, including 1,3-butanediol, water, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride solution, fixed oils such as synthetic mono- or diglycerides, fatty acids such as oleic acid, and the like. Such injectable pharmaceutical formulations are formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or setting agents and suspending agents. Injectable compositions will generally contain from 0.1 to 5% w/w of a compound of the invention. Solid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. For such oral administration, a pharmaceutically acceptable composition containing a compound(s) of the invention is formed by the incorporation of any of the normally employed excipients, such as, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, pregelatinized starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, talcum, cellulose ether derivatives, glucose, gelatin, sucrose, citrate, propyl gallate, and the like. Such solid pharmaceutical formulations may include formulations, as are well-known in the art, to provide prolonged or sustained delivery of the drug to the gastrointestinal tract by any number of mechanisms, which include, but are not limited to, pH sensitive release from the dosage form based on the changing pH of the small intestine, slow erosion of a tablet or capsule, retention in the stomach based on the physical properties of the formulation, bioadhesion of the dosage form to the mucosal lining of the intestinal tract, or enzymatic release of the active drug from the dosage form. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the compounds include emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs, optionally containing pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like. These compositions can also contain additional adjuvants such as wetting, emulsifying, suspending, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. Topical dosage forms of the compounds include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants, eye ointments, eye or ear drops, impregnated dressings and aerosols, and may contain appropriate conventional additives such as preservatives, solvents to assist drug penetration and emollients in ointments and creams. Topical application may be once or more than once per day depending upon the usual medical considerations. Furthermore, preferred compounds for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles. The formulations may also contain compatible conventional carriers, such as cream or ointment bases and ethanol or oleyl alcohol for lotions. Such carriers may be present as from about 1% up to about 98% of the formulation, more usually they will form up to about 80% of the formulation. Transdermal administration is also possible. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for transdermal administration can be presented as discrete patches adapted to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. Such patches suitably contain a compound of the invention in an optionally buffered, aqueous solution, dissolved and/or dispersed in an adhesive, or dispersed in a polymer. A suitable concentration of the active compound is about 1% to 35%, preferably about 3% to 15%. For administration by inhalation, the compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pump spray device not requiring a propellant gas or from a pressurized pack or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, tetrafluoroethane, heptafluoropropane, carbon dioxide, or other suitable gas. In any case, the aerosol spray dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount so that the resulting metered dose inhaler (MDI) is used to administer the compounds of the invention in a reproducible and controlled way. Such inhaler, nebulizer, or atomizer devices are known in the prior art, for example, in PCT International Publication Nos. WO 97/12687 (particularly Figure 6 thereof, which is the basis for the commercial RESPIMAT® nebulizer); WO 94/07607; WO 97/12683; and WO 97/20590, to which reference is hereby made. Rectal administration can be effected utilizing unit dose suppositories in which the compound is admixed with low-melting water-soluble or insoluble solids such as fats, cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights, or fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycols, or the like. The active compound is usually a minor component, often from about 0.05 to 10% by weight, with the remainder being the base component. In all of the above pharmaceutical compositions, the compounds of the invention are formulated with an acceptable carrier or excipient. The carriers or excipients used must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and must not be deleterious to the patient.
