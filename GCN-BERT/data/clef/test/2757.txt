Composition for improving the appearance of ageing skin The present invention relates to a composition for improving the appearance of ageing skin and of facial structures, such as contour and shape. It also deals with the treatment of facial ligaments with liquid compositions or pharmaceutical formulations comprising particulate, viscosity increasing or osmotic substances. The optical appearance of the human face is strongly influenced by the skin but also by the structure of the face and in particular the facial ligaments. Ligaments are fibrous condensations which are osteo-cutaneous and musculo-cutaneous supporting structures. They often connect bones to other bones. They are also known as articular ligaments or fibrous ligaments. Ligaments are located at many parts of the human body, such as knees or elbows, but also found under the skin of the human face. The skin of the human face in general is a multifunctional organ, including the function of protection against environmental influences. Skin is built up from several different layers (see Fig. 1 b), which decrease in elasticity and resilience over time due to age-related modifications. The facial skin of a person is especially exposed to environmental influences and countenance. Therefore, there is a high need for a convenient treatment for tightening of ageing facial structures and skin. Exemplarily, in the human cheek region, most muscles are more or less tightly but continuously connected together and with the skin by means of interwoven connective tissue, the so called superficial muscular aponeurotic system (SMAS). From there, strands run toward the skin (false retaining ligaments) and form the septa of the compartments. There are also strands of connective tissue that insert into bone, called true retaining fibers. The mid-facial ageing is described by B.C. Mendelson (Surgical anatomy of the midcheek-facial layers, Clin Plast Surg. 2008, 35, 395-404) and by A.E. Wulc (The anatomic basis of midfacial ageing, 2012, 15- 28). The morphologic changes over time occurring in the mid face and the pathogenesis of midfacial ageing based on anatomic components are discussed. Mendelson postulates that ligamentous laxity may be responsible for facial ageing. The author proposes that the ligaments serve to stabilize the face in youth, but that continuous muscular activity in combination with intrinsic ageing changes can lead to weakness of ligamentous support in the face. Various types of so-called "prolotherapy" are known for strengthening lax ligaments, e.g. in the knee. The mechanism of action of prolotherapy is not well understood. Proliferating agents are injected into stretched or torn ligaments of the knee, resulting over weeks in the loss of pain in the affected area. The proliferant compounds seem to lead to a localized inflammation which diminishes gradually over days. The efficiency of prolotherapy was reviewed by R.G. Schwarz (J Neurol Orthop Med Surg., 12, 1991 , 220-223). Two-thirds of the patients reported a reduction of sacroiliac low back pain. Prolotherapy is applied as an injection-based treatment for chronic pain. Schwarz concluded that it is possible to induce proliferation of collagen in human ligaments of the human back by using prolotherapy. The tissue proliferating is a dense collagen and seems associated with a reduction in pain. A. Banks (Journal of Orthopaedic Medicine, 13, 1991 , No 3) summarized potential substances (irritants, particulates, osmotics, and chemotactics) for prolotherapy. The first classes of proliferant solutions, called irritants, are e.g. phenol, guaiacol and tannic acid. Particulates, such as pumice flour, are small particles of about 1 micron, which attract macrophages. Other proliferants lead to an osmotic shock. These agents act by dehydrating cells at the injection site. The chemotactics are represented by sodium morrhuate, a mixture of fatty acid salts. The chemotactic composition contains the biosynthetic precursors to certain chemotactic agents which attract inflammatory cells. M.J. Yelland (Spine, 29, 2004, 2126-2133) described randomized controlled trials of prolotherapy injections for chronic low back pain. Prolotherapy injections alone were not found more effective than control injections alone. However, M. Scarpone (Clin J Sport Med., 18, 2008, 248-254) published a pilot study wherein the efficacy of prolotherapy for lateral epicondylosis was tested. Prolotherapy with dextrose and sodium morrhuate seemed well tolerated and decreased elbow pain. Y. Akihiro in "Effects of hyperosmolality on the central nervous system and intracranial hemorrhage", Brain and Development, 1982, 4, 353-360, describes the injection of hyper-osmotic compositions comprising glucose, NaCI and NaHCO3. B. Petersen in "A glucose-dependent mechanism in jejunum inhibits gastric acid secretion: a response mediated through enteroglucagon", Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology, 1985, 20, 193-197, describes the influence of glucose (300- 1200 mOsm/l) on secretion in the stomach. US 201 1/195925 describes a process for sterilization of hyaluronic acid compositions, which have a high osmolarity. WO 2007/077399 proposes a gel of hyaluronic acid and glycerol for dermal applications. FR-A 2938187 (2010) discloses an injectable formulation of hyaluronic acid and glycerol and lidocaine. WO 2000/37047 proposes a kit for an injectable composition of hyaluronic acid salt and lidocaine. In WO 2006/015131 , facial tissue strengthening and tightening devices are described. The devices can be used by surgeons to provide uniform facial tissue planes. The possibility of applying chemical agents for facial tightening with the devices is mentioned. The human face is covered by complexly composed skin and comprises various ligaments. Figure 1 a shows a human face with mouth, nose and ears and two exemplified ligaments (L1 and L2). The different layers of facial skin are shown in Figure 1 b. The first layer is the epidermis (Figure 1 b-1 ) which is composed of the outermost layers of cells in the skin; the thickness can vary from 0.05 mm to 1 .5 mm. The second layer is the dermis (Figure 1 b-2). Main components are dermal cells (fibroplasts, histiocytes and mast cells), dermal fibers (collagen fibers and reticulin fibers), and dermal matrix. Dependent on the location, the thickness of the dermis varies strongly. The third layer is the subcutaneous tissue (Figure 1 b-3) containing mainly lax conjunctive tissue. It is followed by the fourth layer, the musculoaponeurotic (Figure 1 b-4), relating to muscular and aponeurotic tissue. It is attached by retinacular cutis fibers within the subcutaneous layer to the dermis and the epidermis. These four layers (Figure 1 b-7) form a functional unit which is mobile because loose areolar tissue and retaining ligaments (Figure 1 b-5) permits gliding movement of the composite scalp over the fixed sixth layer, periosteum and deep fascia (Figure 1 b-6). Transferred to the mid cheek (see Figure 1 a) the musculo-aponeurotic is described as superficial muscular aponeurotic system (SMAS). The SMAS contains the intrinsic muscles of the cheek, which have a limited attachment to the underlaying facial skeleton and a more extensive attachment to the soft tissue which they move. Optical changes of the human face, which originate from ageing, mostly occur in the midface. These optical changes may occur due to gravity, fat atrophy, and deterioration in the condition and appearance of the skin. The facial ligaments serve as stabilizer in the youth face. Continuous muscular activity in combination with intrinsic ageing changes lead to weakness of ligamentous support. Since many years, surgery is a known treatment of aged facial skin, see B.C. Mendelson (Surgical anatomy of the midcheek, Clin Plast Surg.). However, surgery is uncomfortable, painful und unsightly. There is a high need for a better treatment of ageing facial structures and facial skin, with reduced or no side effects. This improvement can be applied by a minimally invasive method. The present invention relates to a liquid composition for improving the facial contour and shape of the human or animal face by injection, the liquid composition comprising water and at least one of the following components A, B and C: a) a component A, which leads to an osmotic concentration in the range from 500 to 5000 mOsm, in particular from 1200 to 4000 mOsm in the liquid composition, b) a high viscosity component B, which leads to a viscosity of the liquid composition in the range from 10 to 1500 mPas, in particular from 200 to 1000 mPas, c) a micro-particles component C, comprising micro-particles with an average particle size not larger than 0.25 mm, preferably in the range of 0.001 mm to 0.25 mm, in particular in the range of 0.001 mm to 0.1 mm, and optionally comprising d) a local anesthetic compound D. Often, the composition is administered for improving the ligamentous laxity of the face via injection either into the or close to the ligaments of the face (e.g. in an amount of 0.1 to 1 .5 ml). Often, two of these components are combined in the liquid composition, such as A+B, A+C or B+C. In one embodiment, three different of these components are combined in the liquid composition, such as A+B+C, A+C+D or A+B+C or B+C+D.

The composition of the present invention can be injected into, or near the ligament of a human or animal to be treated. The composition of the present invention may further be injected with the needle toughing bone. The process or method of treatment by injection is not limited to a single injection at a specific area. The treatment of ligaments via injection of a composition according to present invention may also be performed at several ligaments in parallel or in sequence. Blunt cannulas may be too blunt to penetrate ligaments. The injection via a blunt cannula occurs in an area close to the ligament. Trained persons injecting the composition will feel resistance of the ligament and inject aforesaid composition in implied area. The composition should be injected at least 0.5 mm from treating ligament, preferably 0.2 mm. Sharp cannulas or sharp needles can penetrate into ligaments. The injection via sharp cannula or sharp needle occurs into the ligament. Trained persons injecting the composition will feel resistance of the ligament, insert into it and inject aforesaid composition into the ligament. Suitable ligaments may be selected from the group of false retaining ligaments, comprising masseter-cutaneous retinacula, bucco-maxillar retinacula (buccal part), and platysma-auricular retinacula. Further, ligaments may be selected from the group of true retaining ligaments, comprising orbital retinacula, zygomatic retinacula (McGregor's patch), bucco-maxillar retinacula (maxillar part), mandibular retinacula, platysma-mandibular ligament, and submental ligament. Preferably, the composition of present invention may be applied to the bucco- maxillar retinacula (L1 ) and/or the platysma-mandibular (L2) depicted in Figure 1 a, in particular it can be administered to the Zygomatic ligaments (McGregor's patch). The composition of the present invention may be filled up in flacons, ampoules, vessels, or prefilled syringes. In one embodiment, the composition is located in prefilled syringes (ready to use syringe, RTUS), which can markedly improve the safety of use of injectable preparations. Sterilization of the RTUS is performed via heat, radiation, chemical, or filtration sterilization. Preferably the sterilization may occur via heat or UV-irradiation. The method for optical improving the facial contour and shape of the human face comprises the administration of a composition of present invention. This process comprises the injection into, or near the ligament to be treated. In a first step, the skin areas above the ligaments of the face should be cleaned. In a second step, an aqueous liquid composition into or nearby specific ligaments of the face containing at least one of the component A, B, or C and optionally component D is injected. This injection step may optionally be repeated several times, preferably 0 to 20 times, particular preferably 1 to 10 times. The composition of the present invention may further be injected with the needle. The volume of composition applied for each injection is in the range of 0.01 to 1 .5 ml, preferably 0.01 to 1 .2 ml. Particular preferably the volume of injection is in the range of 0.02 to 0.9 ml. The process of injection, wherein several injections of the aqueous composition are administered at specific areas of the face, may be repeated from 1 to 20 times, preferably from 1 to 10 times. However, a single treatment may be sufficient. Intervals of injection may range from 5 days to 10 months, preferably 1 day to 9 months. However, a single treatment may be sufficient.

DOSE PREPARATION: Prepared daily on dosing days. CAGESIDE OBSERVATIONS: Twice daily (mortality/moribundity) BODY WEIGHTS: Day 1 , 7, 14, 21 & 30. NECROPSY: All animals are euthanized and the right and left hind limbs are disarticulated at the hip joint. Extraneous tissue are dissected away to carefully expose the femur-MCL-tibia complex. The biomechanical properties of the MCL are then be evaluated using an Instron Mechanical Test System. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (n=48): The left MCL for all animals are placed in 10% formalin for IHC staining of Collagen Type I and III. The MCLs from each rat are be imbedded in paraffin and sectioned. One slide will be stained for Type I and a second for Type III. The percent of Collagen (positive stain area/total tissue area) for Type I and III are then be reported. BIOMECHANICS (n=24): The right MCL for all animals undergo destructive testing. The femur-MCL-tibia complex are mounted into a custom holder. A pre- lead of (0.1 N) is applied and the MCL preconditioned (cyclical loading to 1 % strain for 10 cycles). The ligament initial length and cross-sectional area is determined. The ligament is then be pulled to failure at 10% per second. Example 3 (Testing of the compositions) The compositions according to experiments 1 a to 1f can be administered via sharp needle into e.g. the human zygomatic ligaments (McGregor's patch) in an explorative clinical trial. Different product concentrations and treatment regimens are to be used for dose-finding and dose-regimen (trials might be conducted in separate settings). As examples, the liquid composition 1 a or 1f is administered via sharp needle into (or alternatively 2 mm next to) the human facial ligament (0.5 ml, twice daily for three days) for improving the laxity of the face. 1 .
