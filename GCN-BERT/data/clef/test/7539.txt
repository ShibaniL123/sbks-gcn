STATEMENT WITH REGARD TO FEDERAL SPONSORED RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Some of the embodiments described herein were made with Government support under Grants awarded by the National Institute of Health. The Government has may have certain rights in the described embodiments. BACKGROUND The embodiments disclosed herein generally relate to implantable devices and more particularly to systems and methods for improving performance of implantable devices. The performance and accuracy of transcutaneous and implantable sensors is believed to be affected by biofouling, tissues reactions at or near the site of the sensor, and reduction of analyte access due to inflammation, blood vessel regression and fibrous encapsulation. In addition to causing problems with sensor function, tissues reactions and sensitivities due to the presence of transcutaneous and totally implantable sensors can cause discomfort to a user, and can lead to inflammation and infection. In diabetic patients, determination and effective management of blood glucose levels is critical to minimizing diabetes related complications. Traditionally finger sticking and external monitors coupled with insulin injections have been used to manage blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes, but because of the need for frequent “finger sticks”, many patients with diabetes do not adequately monitor their blood glucose levels. More recently, the development of implantable glucose sensors to continuously monitor blood glucose levels (CGM) and continuous insulin infusion (subcutaneous insulin infusion, SCII) have significantly enhanced the management of blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes. Current glucose sensors used in CGM limits the need for frequent blood analysis and provides significantly enhanced insights into the dynamic nature of blood glucose changes in patients with diabetes. Unfortunately current commercial sensors have a limited functional lifespan in vivo (3-7 days). When CGM and SCII are combined in a single patient, but under the supervision of the patient, it is referred to as an open loop system. When the implanted glucose sensor (i.e. CGM) controls insulin infusion (i.e. SCII) without the intervention of the patient this is referred to as a “closed loop” system or artificial pancreas. Development of an artificial pancreas (i.e. closed-loop technology) to clinically manage diabetes is a major goal of the diabetes community. Recently, there have been an increasing number of success stories of short-term closed-loop clinical trials. Central to the goal of the development of long-term closed loop technology is the development of a long-term glucose sensor with high accuracy that can effectively control insulin infusion (SCII). Because of questions of in vivo reliability and limited lifespan of current commercial sensors effectiveness in both open and closed loop systems is limited. Much of the lack of sensor performance in vivo is thought to be the result of sensor induced inflammation, fibrosis and fibrosis-induced vessel regression at the site of sensor implantation. It has often been argued that the loss of blood vessels proximal to the sensor (i.e. fibrosis induced vessel regression) at the sensor implantation site is a major cause of the loss of effective CGM in open and closed loop systems. Two of the major problems associated with the uses of prosthetic meshes are 1) their propensity to induce chronic inflammation and excessive fibrosis, with resulting loss of mesh pliability and mechanical integrity, increased stiffness at the site of the implantation, and 2) post mesh implantation infections. Frequently the result of poor mesh biocompatibility is excessive inflammation and subsequent fibrosis. This can result in limited tissue mobility of the groin and abdominal wall and chronic pain and loss of mobility for the patient. It is generally accepted that foreign body reactions (FBRs) characterized by chronic inflammation, giant cell formation, fibrosis (collagen plates) and vessel regression result in loss of mesh function via mesh contraction and mesh distortion (e.g. loss of functional pore size), as well as mesh calcification. Clearly, improving the biocompatibility of the mesh implants (i.e. decreasing inflammation and fibrosis) and mesh biostability, given the susceptibility of PET to enzymatic & hydrolytic degradation is anticipated to result in improved mesh function by decreasing mesh distortion, calcification and loss of mechanical integrity that are all too commonly associated with mesh-based reconstructive surgeries. In addition to biocompatibility, infection associated with mesh implantation frequently compromise mesh function and dramatically impact a patient's daily life. The timeframe for mesh related infections range from 10 days post implantation (short term) up to several years post mesh implantation (long term infections). Mesh infections increase pain and discomfort, hospital stay, healing/recovery time, cost, morbidity, mortality, and may require additional surgery to remove device. It would be useful to develop products, systems and methods that maintain acceptable performance over longer periods of time, and that reduce tissue reactions and sensitivities at or near the implantation site.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Based on work described herein, the applicant believes that both fibrosis itself and fibrosis-induced vessel regression work synergistically to limit effective CGM in vivo. Specifically fibrosis not only induces blood vessel regression at sites of sensor implantation but fibrosis is also known to slow glucose diffusion between the blood vessel and the implanted glucose sensor. This fibrosis based inhibition of glucose diffusion results in the loss of “real time” blood glucose measurements because of the element of time delay. Based on work described herein, the applicant believes that both fibrosis itself and fibrosis-induced vessel regression work synergistically to limit effective CGM in vivo. Specifically fibrosis not only induces blood vessel regression at sites of sensor implantation but fibrosis is also known to slow glucose diffusion between the blood vessel and the implanted glucose sensor. This fibrosis based inhibition of glucose diffusion results in the loss of “real time” blood glucose measurements because of the element of time delay. In the past, efforts to overcome fibrosis and vessel regression in injured tissues such as ischemic hearts and limbs have focused on the uses of recombinant angiogenic factors (AF) and genes (e.g. VEGF) to induce tissue regeneration. Although local delivery of recombinant AF such as VEGF can cause neovascularization of the tissue, the ceasing of AF delivery generally results in vessel regression and loss of tissue viability. This limitation of recombinant AF has spurred efforts to utilize local AF gene therapy to create and sustain vascular networks at sites of tissue injury and ischemia. Although there has been significant discussion related to the importance of neovascularization in sensor function, in actuality there have only been limited sensor studies to demonstrate its effect. In all the cases known to the applicant, the issue of vessel regression with the ceasing of VEGF delivery remains a major problem with this approach. Embodiments described herein utilize a murine model of CGM and adenovirus based local gene therapy over a 28 day time period, and show that local gene therapy using VEGFa adenoviruses can induce significant angiogenesis and neovascularization at sensor implantation sites and thereby significantly extend glucose sensor life spans in vivo. A new and effective way of applying coatings to sensors is also described herein. In the past, biological coatings were applied in liquid or gel form at the time they were to be used. In embodiments described herein, one or more coatings are applied to the sensors and then dehydrated. The sensors can then be packaged in sterile packaging for shipping. The sensors are implanted with dehydrated coatings present thereon. The coatings will become rehydrated due to the present of liquid in the surrounding tissue after they have been implanted. In embodiments, a final hydration step is added before implantation to remove salts that have accumulated as a result of the multiple layering/coating of the sensor. This high salt might be toxic if the coated implantable device were implanted directly into the tissue (salt comes, for example, from the Matrigel buffers, which are important to stabilize the Matrigel in its liquid form). Additionally this rehydration step can also be used to incorporate additional factors into the matrigel such as angiogenic factors, drugs, antimicrobials. This can be important if the factors tend to be libel (be effected by temperature or repeating drying). DEFINITIONS The general meaning of the following terms as used in the present application, unless specifically modified, are: “Normal Cells”: biological cells derived from living organisms, and/or tissues, which retain a normal genotype and phenotype, usually obtained directly from tissue or from primary culture. “Mutant Cells”: biological cells with spontaneously altered genotype and phenotype, such as cancer cells, cell derived from naturally occurring genetically deficient organisms, usually obtained in secondary culture and or continuous cell lines. “Engineered Cells”: genetically or chemically modified biological cells (usual original source is Normal or Mutant cells). “Transgenic Cells”: biological cells derived from transgenic animals, in which the cells have genetically induced alterations of genotype and or phenotype. “Gene Transfer Cells”: biological cells that have altered phenotype resulting in alteration of cell structure and or function. This includes knockouts, knockdowns, “over-expressors” etc. “Chemically Modified Cells”: biological cells in which membrane, cytoplasm structural or enucleolar elements of the cell are altered permanently or for extended periods, thus altering cell structure and or function. “Artificial Cells”: biological cells lacking the ability to replicate but capable of sensing and responding to their microenvironment. For example enucleated cells, or cells lacking a nucleus (e.g. red blood cells), in which genetic elements such as DNA, RNA, viral vectors, nanodevices or nanomaterials can be incorporated for in vivo uses. Hybrid Cells: biological cells that are the result of cells fusion, and or combinations of engineered and or artificial cells. “Matrix material”: complex heterogeneous networks of insoluble macromolecules such as glycoproteins, carbohydrates, structural proteins (e.g. collagen), as well as bound proteins and factors. These matrices contain specific binding sites for cells, factors (e.g. cytokines and growth factors) and proteins, which directly control cell adhesion and function in vivo and in vitro. “Biological Matrices”: matrices obtained from organisms, tissues, or cell. Examples of biological matrices include interstitial matrices, basement membrane, fibrin clots. Interstitial matrices are generally composed of fibrillar and nonfibrillar collagen, elastin, fibronectin proteoglycans, hyuronate, as well as other components. Basement membranes are composed of nonfibrillar collagen (usually IV), laminin, heparin sulfate, proteoglycan, and other glycoproteins. Fibrin clots are complex networks of plasma proteins including fibrin(ogen), fibronectin, glycoproteins, heparin, thrombin collagen, as well as other plasma proteins cross-linked to the fibrin clots via Factor XIII. Additionally, fibrin clots have extensive binding sites for various factors and cells including leukocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells. “Engineered Matrices”: genetically and or chemically modified biological matrices. “Hybrid matrices”: combinations of biological, engineered and or artificial matrices.

In the context of glucose sensors, “sensor sensitivity” is measured as nano-Amps per milli-mole of glucose or nano-Amps per mg of analyte (such as glucose) per deciliter. The mM glucose or dL glucose level is derived from an external meter, using blood from a finger prick, to make the glucose determination. The sensor output and external monitor measurements are made at the same time. Loss of sensor sensitivity can be expressed as the ratio between the change in sensor response in nA divided by the change in blood analyte concentration in mM.

In embodiments, the coating can be applied immediately before assembly, in which case initial dehydration would not be required. In embodiments, the implantable device is a surgical mesh of the type used for reconstructive surgery, such as hernia repair. Matrix Material Referring to FIGS. 1-2, the artificial tissue system (ATS) 12 further includes a matrix material 22. The matrix material 22 may be a natural and/or synthetic materials. For example, the matrix material 22 may include biological matrices such as naturally occurring matrices that occur in viable organisms (in vivo) and tissues including ex vivo tissues, as well as in association with cells maintained in vitro, or combinations thereof. One characteristic of the matrix material 22 is the ability to provide a three dimensional structure to the ATS 12. This three dimensional structure provides a volume of space that allows for biological contact wherein various components of the ATS 12, sensor 10, and surrounding tissues can biologically associate with one another. For example, the matrix material may provide the necessary framework in which various cells can be secured as well as providing for the movement of nutrients, chemicals, and other bioactive agents to, from, and/or between cells, tissues, and/or an implant device, such as, the sensor 10. In addition, the matrix material 22 is in biological contact with portions of the implant device and the surrounding biological system, if present. It should be understood that the biological contact includes, among other things, chemical, liquid, gas, and/or mechanical contact. For example, cellular tissue of the biological system may intrude, or otherwise extend physically into, the volume of space occupied by the matrix material. This cellular tissue may also be in physical, chemical, and/or fluid contact with the cells, portions of the implant device, such as the sensor 10, genetic elements 16, cell response modifiers (CRM) 18, and/or tissue response modifiers (TRM) 20. The genetic elements 16 include, for example, agent(s) that directly cause the temporary or permanent change of the genetic composition or expression of a cell or tissue, or indirectly cause the temporary or permanent change of the genetic composition or expression of a cell or tissue. For example, single or double strand DNA, single or double strand RNA, plasmids, viral vectors, and/or DNA or RNA viral vectors. In addition, it should be understood that the ATS may be formed into, for example, any biologically relevant shape, for example, a tube, sponge, sphere, strand, coiled strand, capillary network, film, fiber, mesh, and/or sheet. In one embodiment the matrix material 22 may include: basement membranes, for example Matrigel™; fibrin clots, including plasma derived clots; collagens, for example, fibrillar collagens (types I, II, III, V and IX collagen); basement membrane collagen, such as type IV collagen; other collagens (types VI, VII, IX, XVII, XV and XVIII collagen); fibronectin; laminin; proteoglycans; glycoproteins; glycoaminoglycans; elastins; hyaluronan; adhesive glycoproteins; mucins; and polysaccharides. In some cases, certain factors can be included with the matrix material 22 to advantageously enhance the characteristics of the matrix material 22 and/or its production. For example, factors that can be included are: TGF-beta; FGF; angiotensin II; Insulin-like growth factor; and Ascorbic acid. In one embodiment, the matrix material 22 is composed of a solubilized basement membrane preparation such as Matrigel™ as supplied from BD Biosciences. The solubilized basement membrane, like fibrin, is a naturally occurring protein matrix/bio-hydrogel, that has a wide variety of binding sites for cells and factors. These factors may include growth factors and cytokines. For example, the solubilized basement membrane may include laminin, collagen, including collagen IV, heparin sulphate proteoglycans, and entactin. Solubilized basement membrane has been used extensively as a cell matrix/depot in a wide variety of in vitro and in vivo studies particularly in the area of tumor cell biology and angiogenesis. In one embodiment the solubilized basement membrane is a liquid at 4° C. but becomes a solid bio-hydrogel when warmed to 37° C. (or less). This ability to convert solubilized basement membrane from a liquid to a solid by simply raising the temperature, allows for a wide variety of strategies for entrapping genetically engineered cells, factors, proteins and genes. It should be understood that the terms entrap, entraps, entrapped, entrapping, and the like are intended to include for the purpose of this application the concept that the matrix material 22 provides a mechanical association with the biological cells and/or that the matrix material 22 provides specific binding sites for the biological cells. For example, specific binding sites which include receptor and/or adhesion sites. As previously discussed, Matrigel is an isolated basement membrane obtained for cells cultured in vitro, which has been used in a wide variety of in vivo and in vitro studies of cell attachment, cell growth and angiogenesis. Like fibrin, Matrigel™ is a naturally occurring matrix derived from basement membrane, that has a wide variety of binding sites for cells and factors (including growth factors and cytokines). Matrigel™ has been used extensively as a cell matrix/depot in a wide variety of in vitro and in vivo studies particularly in the area of tumor cell biology and angiogenesis. Matrigel™ is a liquid at 4° C. but becomes a solid biological matrix when warmed to 37° C. This ability to convert Matrigel™ from a liquid to a solid by simply raising the temperature, allows for a wide variety of strategies for entrapping genetically engineered cells, factors proteins and genes. Matrigel™ and other isolated basement membrane materials possess the characteristics to serve as a tissue interactive biological matrix for the ATS. According to the literature, basement membrane contains laminin, type IV collagen, and a heparin sulfate proteoglycan (perlecan). BD Matrigel™ Matrix is a reconstituted basement membrane preparation that is extracted from the Engelbreth-Holm-Sawrm (EHS) mouse sarcoma, a tumor rich in extracellular matrix proteins (extracted from cell cultures in vitro). Once isolated, the material has approximately 56-61%, or 60%, laminin, 30-31% collagen IV and 7-8% entactin. Matrigel™ matrix also contains heparin sulfate proteoglycan, TGF-Beta, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, fibroblast growth factor and tissue plasminogen activator. The growth factors occur naturally in the EHS tumor. When frozen, Matrigel™ matrix is a solid. When allowed to thaw in a refrigerator (4 C) and when stored in a refrigerator, Matrigel™ matrix is a liquid. Matrigel™ matrix will start to form a gel above 10 Deg. C and will gel rapidly at 22-35 Deg. C. Matrigel™ matrix will form a gel if it is diluted up to a concentration of 3 mg/ml.

If the stem or progenitor cells are derived from bone marrow and are of the MSC, MAPC, or HSC types, then, for example, osteoblasts with dexamethasone, ascorbate, β-glycerol phosphate; chondrocytes with dexamethasone; neuron, glial cells with RA; adipocytes with dexamethasone, insulin, indomethacin, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine; expansion of undifferentiated MAPCs with 2% FBS; osteoblasts with dexamethasone, ascorbate, & glycerol phosphate; platelets, red/white blood cells with erythropoietin, thrombopoietin. If the stem or progenitor cells are derived from adult tissues and are of the Hepatic oval cell, NSC/NPC, Adipose stem cell or MDSC types, then, for example, pancreatic islet cells can be utilized with nicotinamide; osteoblasts with Dexamethasone, ascorbate, & glycerol phosphate; chondrocytes with insulin, ascorbate; and adipocytes with dexamethasone, insulin, indomethacin, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine. FIG. 24 provides a list of angiogenic factors. VEGF-A induces both blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. VEGF-C and VEGF-D induce a predominance of lymphatic vessel and some blood vessels. Method of Applying Coatings In the embodiments shown in FIG. 3, as well as embodiments described below and shown in other figures, multiple layers of a single type of coating optionally can be applied, or a single coating can be used. The overall method of coating is designated as 100. While the method is described in connection with sensors, the same method applies to cannulas and collars (that are not themselves made of ECM), and also to surgical mesh. In other embodiments, multiple layers of different ECMs can be applied to a device. The various layers can have different cells and/or factors incorporated therein. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, multiple layers of a single type of coating are applied. The overall method of coating is designated as 100. Referring to FIG. 3, a device is obtained at 102 and an extracellular matrix material to be used as a coating material is obtained at 104. The coating is configured in liquid or gel form based on the temperature of the coating material (Matrigel™ matrix will start to form a gel at or above 10 Deg. C and will gel rapidly at 22-35 Deg. C). The device is partially or fully coated with the coating material at 106 by dipping, spraying, brushing or another suitable technique. The coating is dried at 108. Drying can take place at room temperature, at elevated temperature, or at a temperature below room temperature including 4 deg. C. The coatings can be dried passively at room temperature or above through the uses of fans/blowers or heating devices at room temp or above (gel) or 4 deg. C (liquid). Drying the liquid or gelatinous basement membrane at different temps likely would change the structures and orientation of the proteins and factors in the basement membrane (for example cross linking occurs as a result of drying). For a coating material such as solubilized basement membrane, which typically is a liquid at 4 degrees centigrade and a gel above 10 degrees centigrade. Optionally, additional coatings can be added before the sensor is used or packaged. As shown in FIG. 3, after drying at 108, a second coating of the same material is applied at 110 and the coating is dried at 112. Optionally, a third layer of the extracellular matrix material is applied at 114 and then dried at 116. Additional coating and drying stages optionally can take place at 118. In some cases, the device is packaged at 120 for later use. When the packaged device is to be used, it is rehydrated before or after implantation, or both, at 122. In other cases, the device is used without being stored or packaged. When used, the device can be rehydrated before or after implantation, or both, at 124. This is done in order to eliminate salts, which have accumulated in the dry coating (toxic to tissue) and also since a sensor with a dry membrane is easier to implant. The wet Matrigel is easily sheared off the sensor surface during implantation. Having it dry is good for storage and shipping since refrigerations is not necessarily needed. Hydrating solution can be aqueous or non-aqueous solutions as well as containing additives such as proteins, drugs, antibodies. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, multiple layers of various coatings are applied. The overall method of coating is designated as 200. Referring to FIG. 4, a device is obtained at 202 and a material (which may or may not be an extracellular matrix) to be used as a coating material is obtained at 204. The coating is configured in liquid or gel form. The device is partially or fully coated with the coating material at 206 by dipping, spraying, or another suitable technique. The coating is dried at 208. Drying can take place at room temperature, at elevated temperature, or at a temperature below room temperature. For a coating material such as solubilized basement membrane, it is generally known that the matrigel is a liquid at 2-10 Dec. C and a gel at 15-30 Dec. C. Optionally, additional coatings can be added before the sensor is used or packaged. As shown in FIG. 4, after drying at 208, a second coating of a different material is applied at 210 and the coating is dried at 212. Optionally, a third layer of either the same extracellular matrix material is applied at 214 and then dried at 216. Additional coating and drying stages optionally can take place at 218. Optionally, the device is packaged at 220 for later use. When the device is to be used, it is rehydrated before or after implantation, or both, at 222. At least two of the coatings are made of extracellular matrix. In embodiments, all of the layers are made of extracellular matrix. FIG. 5 shows photographs of the coating process. A sensor is dipped in basement membrane, such as Matrigel, that is in the form of a liquid. The basement membrane is then dried. A second coat of the same or a different extracellular matrix is then applied and dried. Multiple coatings can be applied and dried. When the sensor is ready for use, the multilayer coating is hydrated to rinse away salts, redried, and implanted in biological tissue. In embodiments, various VEGFs (VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, and/or VEGF-D) individually or in combination are bound to fibronectin (FN). The VEGF-fibronectin combination in turn can be added to ECM preparations such as basement membranes to make a complex that is coated on an implantable device and implanted in a dry or wet form in biological tissue. The ECM-fibronectin-VEGF combination will induce formation of addition vascular networks, thereby extending the useful lifespan of the device. Methods Employed for Gene Transfer In embodiments there are a wide variety of methods employed for gene transfer in cells and tissue. Three of the major approaches used include: 1) plasmid based gene transfer, 2) retrovector based gene transfer and 3) adenovector based gene transfer. Plasmid based gene transfer utilizes “naked” DNA to directly transfer genetic information into cells in vitro and or in vivo. Plasmid based gene transfer has the advantage that it is simple, but it is extremely inefficient particularly in vivo. Retrovector based gene transfer utilizes retroviral vectors to “carry” the selected genetic information into the cells via specific virus receptors on the surface of target cells. Retrovectors have the advantage in that they are extremely stable, but they require a selection procedure, which identifies cells in which the genes have successfully been transferred. Adenovectors, like retrovectors utilizes adenoviral vectors to “carry” the selected genetic information into the cells via specific virus receptors on the surface of target cells. Adenovectors have the advantage of being very efficient in gene transfer also the gene expression may be transient. Generally for gene therapy, adenovectors have been the system of choice. Adenovirus binds to a surface receptor known as CAR, and CARs have been identified on human (hCAR) and murine cells. Unfortunately not all cells have high enough levels of CAR to allow infection with adenovectors, thus limiting the spectrum of target cells in which gene transfer can be achieved. For example, generally fibroblasts have limited levels of CAR and thus are not used as target cells for adenovector based gene transfer. For the ATS a protocol for genes transferred into target cells that are CAR deficient, thus allowing the use of adenovector in these cells. Many of the materials listed above are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/578,171, Klueh et al., filed May 4, 2006 (published as US Patent Publication No. 2007/0077265 on April 5), 2007, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Neovascularization CGM technology allows the patient to monitor their glucose level in real-time and as such alerts the user when glucose levels are falling too low or rising too high. This knowledge can help the user to prevent potential harmful hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic events. Both of these events are damaging to the body's vasculature system and ultimately responsible for diabetes complications including death. Crucial to good CGM performance is an accurate glucose sensor. Gene therapy studies described herein demonstrate that 1) VEGF-A based local gene therapy increases vascular networks (blood vessels and lymphatic vessels) at sites of glucose sensor implantation; and 2) this local increase of vascular networks enhances and extends glucose sensor function in vivo. This data shows that increasing vascular networks at sites of glucose sensor implantation enhances and extends continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in vivo. The formation of new BV is essential to embryonic development, wound healing and tumor growth in vivo. Central to all these various forms of new vessel formation is the local expression of angiogenic factors (AFs) such as VEGF, HGF, PDGF, IL-8, etc (also see FIG. 24). These AFs play a key role in initiating new vessel formation in vivo, i.e. angiogenesis. During neovascularization, new BVs emerge and develop from preexisting vessels through various processes, which include vascular endothelial cell (VEC) proliferation and migration. This initial sequence of events results in tissue invasion by developing capillary sprouts. Upon formation of capillary sprouts, endothelial cells migrate toward the angiogenic stimulus into regeneration or developing tissue. Ultimately, tube to-tube connections are made by the capillary sprouts in order to obtain continuous blood flow. Generally, BVs play a vital role in the delivery of nutrition (glucose) and oxygen to tissues, as well as the removal of CO2 from the tissues. Additionally, these same networks of BVs are also critical to the delivery of inflammatory and immune cells to sites of injury, infection and wound healing. However, the various roles of LVs, as well as their structure and development, L-Angio, are generally not appreciated in the glucose sensor community. LVs are blind vessels, which arise within virtually all tissues. Outflow of the LVs as toward the lymph nodes is maintained by a series of leaflet valves, which allow uni-direction flow within the LVs. In normal tissues the lymphatics represent the major outflow of fluids and cells within the interstitial compartment, and as such have significant impact on interstitial flow and glucose levels. The fluids and cells that flow thru the LVs accumulate within the lymph node and eventually drainage of the lymph node occur back into the blood stream for eventual recirculation (e.g. lymphocytes and macrophages) or removal thru the kidneys and bowel. During tissue trauma, inflammation and wound healing, lymphatics play a critical role in draining excessive fluids (edema), tissue debris and inflammatory cells from the site of injury and thereby decreasing inflammation. This drainage is critical to minimizing additional tissue damage by removing all factors and cells form the trauma site and thereby promoting tissue repair and regeneration. In fact, a growing body of literature has demonstrated that 1) blocking lymphangiogensis enhances inflammation and tissue destruction and 2) enhancing LV number and function diminishes inflammation in a number of disease states. The VEGF-A induced lymphatic vessels can be important in tissue drainage that reduces inflammation and tissue injury, including fluids (edema) and inflammatory cells associated with angiogenesis. The major control of both hemangiogenesis (H-Angio) and L-Angio appears to be through a related group of agonists and receptors known as the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) family. The VEGF family is primarily composed of 4 agonists (VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D) with overlapping functions via their receptors. The agonists exert their angiogenic action on blood vessels (VEGF-A) and lymphatic endothelial cells (ECs) (VEGF-C and VEGF-D) thru 3 receptors present on the surfaces of these cells. Because of the central role of the VEGF family in human diseases such as cancer and inflammation, a number of antagonists of the various members of the VEGF family have been developed. The VEGF family also plays a critical role in controlling wound healing, i.e. repair and regeneration. This central role of the VEGF family in wound healing is the result of the VEGF family's ability to control the formation of vascular networks at sites of tissue injury and inflammation. The ability of the VEGF family to control the formation of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels controls not only the influx of fluids, nutrients (glucose), oxygen and cells into the injured site to promote healing, but it also allows the removal of fluids (edema/swelling), tissue debris, and toxic factors as well as the removal of inflammatory cells all of which reduce inflammation and tissue injury and enhance and extend glucose sensor function and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Frequently, unreliable glucose sensor function in vivo is the result of acute and chronic tissue reactions at the sensor implantation site (i.e. inflammation, fibrosis and vessel regression). These tissue reactions limit sensor function by 1) damaging (inflammation) and regressing (fibrosis) vascular networks (blood and lymphatic) that control real-time movement of fluids (Glucose) and cells (leukocytes) within tissue and 2) by inducing sensor “biofouling”, including creation of leukocyte based “metabolic barriers” surrounding the sensors. Specifically, the loss of blood vessels results in loss of real-time blood glucose levels in the interstitial spaces. The loss of lymphatic networks at implantation sites prevents efficient drainage of tissue debris and inflammatory cells from the implantation site. The failure to properly drain inflammatory cells from implantation sites increases the “inflammatory load” at the implantation sites, thus increasing biofouling and loss of sensor accuracy. The data provided below shows that enhancing both blood vessel (BVs) and lymphatic vessel (LVs) networks at sensor implantation improves the accuracy and extends the functional lifespan of a sensor in continuous glucose monitoring. In addition to the VEGF families of agonists and receptors, additional lymphangiogenic agonists/receptors have also been identified (FIG. 24). As is the case with the VEGF family the agonists can be expressed by a variety of cells if the corresponding receptor is present on lymphatic endothelial cells. The major LymphAngiogenic factors/receptors include Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF)/IGF-1R; Platelet Derived Growth Factor-BB (PDGF-BB)/PDGFa/B; Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1)/Tie-2 and HGF/HG-R 4 (FIG. 24). System Comprising Kit In embodiments, a system is provided comprising a kit that includes at least one extracellular matrix, a device to apply the ECM to an implantable device such as a cannula, or catheter, a protocol for using the kit to coat the implant with at least one layer of ECM as well as a specific drying and hydrating method described. In another embodiment, a system is provided comprising a kit that includes at least one extracellular matrix, a device to apply the ECM to an implantable medical device, with the ECM being applied as a collar or sleeve, and a protocol for using the kit to coat the implant with at least one layer of ECM as well as a specific drying and hydrating method described. In general, the material of the embodiments described herein may be alternately formulated to comprise, consist of, or consist essentially of, any appropriate components herein disclosed. The material of the disclosed embodiments may additionally, or alternatively, be formulated so as to be devoid, or substantially free, of any components, materials, ingredients, factors, cellular constituents, cytokines, growth factors, tissue types, genetic elements, adjuvants or species used in the prior art compositions or that are otherwise not necessary to the achievement of the function and/or objectives of the described embodiments. EXAMPLES Gene therapy studies described below demonstrate that 1) VEGF-A based local gene therapy increases vascular networks (blood vessels and lymphatic vessels) at sites of glucose sensor implantation; and 2) this local increase of vascular networks enhances and extends glucose sensor function in vivo (FIG. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12). This data shows that increasing vascular networks at sites of glucose sensor implantation enhances continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) performance in vivo. Example 1A Impact of Local Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor Gene Therapy on Continuous Glucose Monitoring To induce sustained vascular networks at sites of sensor implantation, the potential of local VEGF gene therapy to extend sensor function and CGM in a murine model was investigated. Specifically, the impact was determined of direct injection of adenovirus vectors containing mouse VEGF gene (AdvVEGF) or AdvLacZ (control virus) at the sites of glucose sensor implantation in vivo (FIG. 6). Injections of viruses or solutions were done at the sensor tip post sensor implantation (see FIG. 6B, arrow). The injection procedure was as follows: Detailed Description of Mouse Surgery: The mice were anesthetized while being monitored for withdrawal reflex, heart rate, respiratory rate, color, and vital signs to ensure appropriate anesthesia before surgical procedures are performed. Prior to the sensor implantation, the back of the mouse was clipped, shaved, and prepared with Betadine solutions. Prior to sensor implantation, 100 to 200 ml of injectable sterile, pyrogen free, 0.9% NaCl was injected subcutaneously (s. c.) in the back area of the anesthetized mouse to provide an “implantation pocket”. The implantation pocket is used to minimize tissue and sensor damage during sensor implantation. A small opening was made in the “implantation pocket” using a 23 to 25-gauge needle and the sensor was then implanted in the subcutaneous pocket with the sensor leads exposed. The size of the sensor implanted was about 0.5 mm in diameter×1 cm long. A small polyester mesh was placed on top of the exposed sensor leads. Sensor leads and nylon mesh were secured to the shaved mouse skin by applying a coating of NewSkin (Liquid Bandage). Mice were kept under anesthesia until New Skin Liquid Bandage was dried. Once sensors are implanted, mice were housed individually as a precaution to prevent dislodging of the sensor. Periodic Blood glucose levels were obtained in the sensor implanted mice. The adenovirus vectors containing VEGF gene (or a control) were injected (30 ul of saline containing virus or saline alone) at site of sensor implantation at various times post sensor implantation (FIG. 6). 1 dosage of virus is injected up to 3 different time intervals (e.g. days 5, 6 and 7 post sensor placement). Additional controls of 1) saline injections and 2) no injections were also done. For each treatment (injection) sensors were implanted in the mice, and on 3 consecutive days (days 6, 7 & 8,) 30 uls of saline, AdvLacZ or AdvVEGF were injected at the implanted sensor tip, i.e. the sensing element of the sensor (see FIG. 6B). After the initial 3 injections were completed there were no further treatments. Both pre and post injection, the mice were allowed to roam freely. It should be noted that CGM was done for 28 days with 21 days post-adenovirus treatment/injection i.e. (days 7-28) to minimize any impact of acquired immunity against adenovirus infected tissue cells 33, 34. CGM output in nAs (FIG. 7A-P) was recorded and actual blood glucose levels were determined using the Abbott Freestyle external monitor (diamonds in FIG. 7A-P). As can be seen in FIG. 7A-D sensors implanted in mice with treatments of no-injection, saline injection (FIG. 7E-H), and Adv-LacZ (viral vector control) (FIG. 7I-L) injection showed periods where the mouse blood glucose (diamonds) did not correspond to sensor output (continuous line). On the other hand, sensors implanted in mice with Adv-VEGF treatment did not experience these sensor functionality losses (Figure M-P). Impact of VEGF Gene Therapy on Sensor Function FIG. 7 shows the results of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in saline, Adv-LacZ, and Adv-VEGFa injected C57BL/6 mice for up to 28 days post sensor implantation (DPI). FIG. 7A-7D shows a control with no injection. FIG. 7E-7H are representative of CGM in saline (control), FIGS. 7I-7L are representative of Adv-LacZ, and FIGS. 7M-7P are representative of Adv-VEGFa injected C57BL/6 mice for up to 28 days post sensor implantation. Sensor output is expressed as CGS output (nA) and is represented by the lines. Diamonds represents Blood glucose levels, and triangles represent injections. For this study a total of 80 mice were evaluated. Example 1B Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) Analysis To assess the impact of local VEGF gene therapy, the resulting CGM data were analyzed using standard Mean MARD analysis. A difference was observed between the four treatment groups, which was statistically significant, as per the Kruskal-Wallis test (p=0.003). The data is shown in FIG. 8. Cumulative average mean MARD from weeks 1 to 4 by treatment group: p-values represent the significance of the difference among the four treatment groups in average mean MARD value for each of individual weeks, by the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. FIG. 8 demonstrates the difference and trends in the MARD values between the treatment groups over the course of the 28-day experiment. Adv-VEGF-A treated mice had lower MARD values than all the other control groups, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving glucose sensor function. In addition the difference between the Adv-VEGF-A MARD values and the other treatment groups grew over the four weeks. In concert with the timing of the injections around the end of the first week, we observed that the statistical difference between the groups, as evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis tests, is not significant during the first week (p=0.205), but become statistically significant in weeks 2, 3, and 4 (p=0.011, 0.002, and 0.008, respectively). FIG. 10 shows Average Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) values for all four weeks of mice treated with adenoviral vectors bearing VEGF-A or LacZ (Adv-VEGF-A or Adv-LacZ), and their saline or no injection controls. FIG. 10 demonstrates the statistical comparisons between the total mean MARDs for mice within each treatment group. As shown in FIG. 10, it was observed that the Adv-VEGF-A treated mice had a total (for the entire 4 week testing period) mean MARD of 17.44+/−5.72%, whereas the Saline and No Injection C57BL/6 control mice had intermediate MARDs of 24.91+/−15.74% and 23.50+/−9.83% respectively, and Adv-LacZ had the worst mean MARD of 31.49+/−14.50%. The Adv-VEGF-A treated mice had significantly (p<0.05) lower total mean MARD than every other treatment group, as measured by student t-tests. In addition, the Adv-VEGF-A mean MARD data was normally distributed, and had a smaller standard deviation than every other group. The sample sizes are relatively large for such investigations with approximately 15 or more mice in each group. Example 1C Blood Vessel Density and Regression Analysis The measured and calculated density of blood vessels among four treatment groups showed a statistically significant increase in the percent area of tissue surrounding the implanted sensor which were identifiable blood vessels, as per immunohistology. The mean percent area, which was blood vessel, for the Adv-VEGFa treated group of mice was 2.15+/−1.55%, whereas the Adv-LacZ, saline, and no treatment groups had mean percent blood vessel areas of 0.77+/−0.23%, 0.76+/−0.48%, and 1.03+/−0.41%, respectively. The statistical significance of the difference among the four treatment groups, measured by the ANOVA statistical test, was a p-value of 0.003. In two tailed student t-tests directly comparing the Adv-VEGFa group to the other three treatment groups specifically, also showed that the Adv-VEGFa mean percent area was statistically greater than the Adv-LacZ, saline, and no treatment groups, with p-values of 0.02, 0.02, and 0.05 respectively. FIG. 9 demonstrates the relative distributions of blood vessel density, through a boxplot of the percent blood vessel area of the respective treatment groups. To determine if there was a significant statistical relationship between the observed increase in blood vessel density and improved sensor function, we conducted a linear regression analysis between blood vessel density and MARD values. As seen in FIGS. 9, 10, 11 and 12, for those mice among all treatment groups that survived the entire four week time course of the experiment and whose blood vessel density around the sensor was measured, a functional improvement of 9.12+/−2.77% decrease in MARD for every 1% increase in blood vessel area was observed. This ratio was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.005 and had a correlation R2 value of 0.40. In addition, a trend in the significance of the positive relationship between increased percent area as blood vessel and improved sensor function can be seen in FIG. 12. FIG. 12 provides a simple linear regression analysis that was conducted on matching histological samples from all treatment groups, whose lymphatic and blood vessels were quantified in counts per square millimeter of mouse back tissue, proximal to the glucose sensor implantation site. The ratio of lymphatic to blood vessels suggests that lymphatic and blood vessels growth, formation, and maintenance track in a 1 to 1 ratio. The significance is expressed as p-values with statistical significance achieved at p<0.05. R2 represent the correlation between the blood and lymphatic vessel variables, as counts per square millimeter. The significance of the linear regression models and their coefficients grows over the four-week time course of the experiment, with those experiments in the fourth week having the greatest significance. This trend parallels the very similar increasing significance of the better and improving MARD values of the Adv-VEGFa injected mice as compared to the other treatment groups, over the same four week time course, as seen in FIG. 8. Assuming that Adv-VEGFa injections are efficacious, these two trends match the results one would expect from the timing of the injections, which occurred around the end of the first week, i.e. days 6, 7, and 8. As seen in FIG. 12, we observe that the statistical significance of the linear regression models and their coefficients, is not significant during the first and second weeks (p=0.442 and 0.111, respectively), but become statistically significant in weeks 3 and 4 (p=0.018 and 0.005, respectively), and consistently grows throughout the four-week experimental time course. Example 1D Analysis of the Impact of Adv-VEGF on Hemangiogenesis at Sensor Implantation Sites To evaluate the impact of Adv-VEGFa and control treatments at sensor implantation sites, tissue samples were obtained from the implantation sites of the various treatment/injection groups and fixed in Zn buffer. The resulting samples were processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC) for vessel detection and quantitation. Mouse blood vessels were detected using anti-mouse CD3127. Non-immune IgG was used as a specificity control for both antibodies. The resulting IHC slides were digitized using an Aperio Digital Microscope. The resulting digital images were analyzed for hemangiogenesis (H-Angio) using ImageJ (NIH). FIG. 9, Blood Vessel Analysis, is a boxplot of blood vessel density as measured by percent area and treatment group. p-values at the top represent student t-test p-values for the significance of the difference between the paired comparisons with Adv-VEGF blood vessel density indicated by the lines. The resulting data was statistically evaluated using student t-test. Adv-VEGFa induced a 1.9, 2.5, and 2.4 fold increase in mean blood vessel percent area H-Angio at sensor implantation sites when compared to non-injected (p=0.025), saline injected (p=0.019) or Adv-LacZ (p=0.004), respectively. These studies clearly demonstrate that Adv-VEGFa increases H-Angio at sensor implantation sites when compared to non-injected and various control treated sensor implantation sites. Equally important is the fact that sensor performance was also enhanced by Adv-VEGFa when compared to all controls (see total mean MARD, FIG. 10). These studies establish “proof of principle” that increasing H-Angio with Adv-VEGFa significantly increases sensor function and CGM. Example 1E Analysis of the Impact of Adv-VEGF-A on Lymphangiogenesis at Sensor Implantation Sites To evaluate the impact of Adv-VEGF-A and control treatments at sensor implantation sites, tissue samples were obtained from the implantation sites of the various treatment/injection groups and fixed in Zn buffer. The resulting samples were processed for immunohistochemistry (NC) for vessel detection and quantitation. Mouse lymph vessels were detected using anti-mouse podoplanin(8), while mouse blood vessels were identified using anti-CD31 immunohistochemistry. Non-immune IgG was used as a specificity control for both antibodies. The resulting IHC slides were digitized using an Aperio Digital Microscope. The resulting digital images were analyzed for lymphangiogenesis (L-Angio) using ImageJ (NIH). The mean percent area as lymph vessel, for the Adv-VEGF-A treated group of mice was 2.12+/−0.81%, whereas the Adv-LacZ, saline, and no treatment groups had mean percent lymph vessel areas of 0.67+/−0.46%, 0.48+/−0.18%, and 0.91+/−0.66%, respectively. The statistical significance of the difference among the four treatment groups, measured by the ANOVA statistical test, was a p-value of 2.03×10−6. FIG. 11 demonstrates the relative distributions of lymph vessel density, through a boxplot of the percent lymph vessel area of the respective treatment groups. The resulting data was statistically evaluated using student t-test. Adv-VEGF-A induced a 2.3, 4.5, and 3.2 fold increase in mean lymph vessel percent area L-Angio at sensor implantation sites when compared to non-injected (p=0.001), saline injected (p=0.0001) or Adv-LacZ (p=0.0002), respectively. These studies clearly demonstrate that Adv-VEGF-A increases L-Angio at sensor implantation sites when compared to non-injected and various control treated sensor implantation sites. Equally important is the fact that sensor performance was also enhanced by Adv-VEGF-A when compared to all controls (see total mean MARD, FIG. 10). These studies establish “proof of principle” that increasing L-Angio with Adv-VEGF-A significantly increases sensor function and CGM. Example 1F Blood Vs Lymph Graph Lymphatic and blood vessels from histological samples of all treatment groups were quantified in counts per square millimeter of mouse back tissue, proximal to the glucose sensor implantation site, as per immunohistology following staining of selected samples against CD31 and podoplanin antigens, to identify blood and lymph vessels respectively. In FIG. 12, a graph of the relationship between blood and lymphatic vessel counts for each individual sample is illustrated, with a linear trend line. In addition, simple linear regression analysis was conducted on these counts per square millimeter of blood and lymphatic vessels in mouse back tissue. The ratio of lymphatic to blood vessels (1.06+/−0.25) suggests that lymphatic and blood vessel growth, formation, and maintenance track in a 1 to 1 correspondence, which is consistent with other observations, particular in cornea experimental models (ref). Particularly in response to VEGF-A, the vessel growth of both blood and lymph vessels are biologically coordinated. As shown in FIG. 13B, the linear regression model of this blood and lymph coordination from our histological observations was very significant (p=0.0001), particularly since the sample size for this model was relatively large (n=39). R2 represents the statistically correlation between the blood and lymphatic vessel variables, as counts per square millimeter, and was 0.33. Example 1G Lymph Vessel Density and Regression Analysis To determine if there was a significant statistical relationship between the observed increase in lymph vessel density and improved sensor function, we conducted a linear regression analysis between lymph vessel density and MARD values. FIG. 13C provides a simple linear regression analysis to determine the contribution of lymph vessel density to glucose sensor function. Reduction in average Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) values represents an improvement in glucose sensor function. Quantified increases in lymphatic vessels, as measured in percent area as lymphatic vessel, are determined to decrease MARD values by the ratios in the table above, and therefore improve glucose sensor function. The results are tabulated for all data combined (total) and cumulative one, two, three, and four weeks only, i.e. all those mice that survive into the first, second, third, and fourth weeks respectively. The significance is expressed as p-values with statistical significance achieved at p<0.05. R2 represent the correlation between MARD and percent area as lymphatic vessel variables. As seen in FIG. 13C, for those mice among all treatment groups that survived the entire four week time course of the experiment and whose lymph vessel density around the sensor was measured, a functional improvement of −4.29+/−1.70% decrease in MARD for every 1% increase in lymph vessel area was observed. This ratio was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.024 and had a correlation R2 value of 0.30. In addition, a trend in the significance of the positive relationship between increased percent area as lymph vessel and improved sensor function can be seen in FIG. 13C. The significance of the linear regression models and their coefficients grows over the four-week time course of the experiment, with those experiments in the fourth week having the greatest significance. This trend parallels the very similar increasing significance of the better and improving MARD values of the Adv-VEGF-A injected mice as compared to the other treatment groups, over the same four week time course, as seen in FIG. 8. Assuming that Adv-VEGF-A injections are efficacious, these two trends match the results one would expect from the timing of the injections, which occurred around the end of the first week, i.e. days 6, 7, and 8. As seen in FIG. 13C, we observe that the statistical significance of the linear regression models and their coefficients, is not significant during the first, second, or third weeks (p=0.69, 0.226, and 0.080 respectively), but become statistically significant only in week 4 (p=0.024), but consistently grows throughout the four week experimental time course. The linear regression model was also statistically over the entire 4 week time course, (p=0.046). By comparison, the mean percent area as blood vessel, for the Adv-VEGF treated group of mice was 2.15+/−1.55%, whereas the Adv-LacZ, saline, and no treatment groups had mean percent blood vessel areas of 0.77+/−0.23%, 0.76+/−0.48%, and 1.03+/−0.41%, respectively. The statistical significance of the difference among the four treatment groups, measured by the ANOVA statistical test, was a p-value of 0.003. In two tailed student t-tests directly comparing the Adv-VEGF group to the other three treatment groups specifically, also showed that the Adv-VEGF mean percent area was statistically greater than the Adv-LacZ, saline, and no treatment groups, with p-values of 0.02, 0.04, and 0.05 respectively (FIG. 9). FIG. 11 demonstrates the relative distributions of blood vessel density, through a boxplot of the percent blood vessel area of the respective treatment groups. To determine if there was a significant statistical relationship between the observed increase in blood vessel density and improved sensor function, we conducted a linear regression analysis between blood vessel density and MARD values. FIG. 13A provides a simple linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the contribution of blood vessel density to glucose sensor function. Reduction in average Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) values represents an improvement in glucose sensor function. Quantified increases in blood vessels, as measured in percent area as blood vessel, are determined to decrease MARD values by the ratios in the table above, and therefore improve glucose sensor function. The results are tabulated for all data combined (total) and cumulative one, two, three, and four weeks only, i.e. all those mice that survive into the first, second, third, and fourth weeks respectively. The significance is expressed as p-values with statistical significance achieved at p<0.05. R2 represent the correlation between MARD and percent area as blood vessel variables. As seen in FIG. 13A, for those mice among all treatment groups that survived the entire four week time course of the experiment and whose blood vessel density around the sensor was measured, a functional improvement of 9.12+/−2.77% decrease in MARD for every 1% increase in blood vessel area was observed. This ratio was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.005 and had a correlation R2 value of 0.40. In addition, a trend in the significance of the positive relationship between increased percent area as blood vessel and improved sensor function can be seen in FIG. 13A. The significance of the linear regression models and their coefficients grows over the four-week time course of the experiment, with those experiments in the fourth week having the greatest significance. This trend parallels the very similar increasing significance of the better and improving MARD values of the Adv-VEGF-A injected mice as compared to the other treatment groups, over the same four week time course, as seen in FIG. 8. Assuming that Adv-VEGF injections are efficacious, these two trends match the results one would expect from the timing of the injections, which occurred around the end of the first week, i.e. days 6, 7, and 8. As seen in FIG. 13A, we observe that the statistical significance of the linear regression models and their coefficients, is not significant during the first and second weeks (p=0.442 and 0.111, respectively), but become statistically significant in weeks 3 and 4 (p=0.018 and 0.005, respectively), and consistently grows throughout the four-week experimental time course. Example 1H Combined Linear Regression Model with Both Blood and Lymph variables Simple Linear Regression Analysis was then Conducted to Determine the contribution of both blood and lymph vessel density to glucose sensor function. Reduction in average Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) values represents an improvement in glucose sensor function. Quantified increases in both blood and lymph vessels, as measured in percent area as blood or lymph vessel, were determined to decrease MARD values by the ratios described above, and therefore improve glucose sensor function. The results are tabulated for all data combined (total) and cumulative one, two, three, and four weeks only, i.e. all those mice that survive into the first, second, third, and fourth weeks respectively. FIG. 13D provides a simple linear regression analysis to determine the contribution of both blood and lymph vessel density to glucose sensor function. Reduction in average Mean Absolute Relative Difference (MARD) values represents an improvement in glucose sensor function. Quantified increases in blood vessels, as measured in percent area as blood vessel, are determined to decrease MARD values by the ratios in the table above, and therefore improve glucose sensor function. The results are tabulated for all data combined (total) and cumulative one, two, three, and four weeks only, i.e. all those mice that survive into the first, second, third, and fourth weeks respectively. The significance is expressed as p-values with statistical significance achieved at p<0.05. R2 represent the correlation between MARD and both the percent area as blood vessel and percent area as lymphatic vessel variables, as per this linear regression model. As seen in FIG. 13D, for those mice among all treatment groups that survived the entire four week time course of the experiment and whose blood and lymph vessel density around the sensor was measured, a functional improvement of 7.13+/−4.74% decrease in MARD for every 1% increase in blood vessel area, and a 1.28+/−2.59% decrease in MARD for every 1% increase in lymph vessel area was observed. This ratio was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.03 and had a correlation R2 value of 0.40. In addition, a trend in the significance of the positive relationship between increased percent area as blood and lymph vessel and improved sensor function can be seen in FIG. 13A. As seen in FIG. 13D, we observe that the statistical significance of the linear regression models and their coefficients, is not significant during the first, second, and third weeks (p=0.321, 0.293, and 0.068 respectively), but becomes statistically significant in week 4 (p=0.030), and consistently grows throughout the four-week experimental time course. R2 represents the correlation between MARD and both the percent area as blood vessel and percent area as lymphatic vessel variables, as per this linear regression model was 0.40, approximately the same as for the linear regression model for MARDs with the blood vessel variable alone. Example 2 Basement Membrane Coating for Glucose Sensors In order to develop a protocol for matrix coating of glucose sensors that would allow a simple in vivo sensor implantation a coating and drying protocol was developed for coating the glucose sensors. In this Example, modified Abbott Navigator sensors were used. FIG. 14 contains photographs depicting cell culture derived basement membrane (Matrigel) coating of Abbott Navigator sensor tip combined contribution(s) of H-Angio and L-Angio to this enhanced CGM seen in Adv-VEGF treatment of the implantation sites. The addition of Matrigel basement membrane to the Navigator sensors resulted in a simple “jelly-like” coating around the sensor (FIG. 14A). To assure that the Matrigel basement membrane coating would stay associated with the sensor during sensor insertion the Matrigel coated sensor was air-dried overnight (FIG. 14B). The basement membrane coating on the sensors was then re-hydrated with H2O (FIG. 14C). The Matrigel basement membrane dried as an even coating, and was also able to rapidly re-hydrate. The rapid re-hydrating of the dry Matrigel on the sensor provided significant biocompatibility and protective barrier around the implanted sensor as well as provides a flexible tissue response modifier delivery system. It should also be noted that with multi ECM layers involving coating and dehydrating there can be a significant accumulation of salt in the dried basement membrane. The final rehydration and drying cycle allows for removal of the excess salts from the multi-coated Matrigel, which may otherwise be toxic to the tissue. Example 3 Impact of Basement Membrane on Glucose Sensor Function In Vivo Once it was determined that Matrigel does not adversely affect functionality and sensitivity of the sensor in vitro (FIG. 15), the effect of Matrigel on sensor function in vivo was then determined (FIG. 16). For that, 15 ul of Matrigel (growth factor enriched) were added to the tip of the sensor and allowed to dry and then implanted as previously described. Sensors were implanted in the presence (Matrigel+sensor) or absence (buffer+sensor) of Matrigel. Immediately after sensor implantation, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was initiated using the mouse system. Sensor accuracy was further evaluated by calculation of the MARD. Non-Matrigel treated sensor had MARD values of 11.3% for the period up to 4 DPI and 38.0% for the CGM period of 4 to 14 DPI (FIG. 16A). The significant increase in the MARD value for non-Matrigel treated sensors was also reflected by the fluctuating sensor response not correlating with blood glucose levels (FIG. 16-A). MARD value for Matrigel treated sensor ranged from 7.6% to 6.6% for the testing period up to 4 DPI and 4 DPI to 14 DPI, respectively (FIG. 16-B). It is believed that Matrigel likely enhances sensor performance by protecting the sensor from biofouling. In summary, these studies demonstrate that a bio-active membrane such as Matrigel can dramatically enhance sensor function in vivo. These studies also support the hypothesis that the uses of bio-matrices such as basement membrane increase the in vivo lifetime of an implantable glucose sensor. It should be noted that the data in FIG. 16 is compressed and as such the sensor response might appear as noisy signals. This is only an artifact of the presentation of the data over the 14-day time frame and due to the many data points obtained over this time frame (e.g. 1 data point/minute). Although the animals are not diabetic in these studies the mouse glucose level is still not stagnant (range for normal glucose level is 80-120 mg/dL) and the waves of glucose excursion can appear as noisy. Example 4 Coating Glucose Sensors with Basement Membrane In order to determine capability of layers of matrices on our sensors, 5 ul of 10 mg/ml Matrigel was added to the tip of a biosensor (Abbott Freestyle Navigator). Prior to Matrigel addition and immediately following Matrigel addition, sensors were tested in a 113 mg/dL buffered glucose solution. Additionally, the sensors were tested 12 hours post-Matrigel addition. For that, Matrigel was added to sensor tips and allowed to dry overnight. Sensors containing matrix Matrigel was allowed to re-hydrate for 30 minutes prior to testing in buffered glucose solution. It was found that sensor sensitivity remained unchanged in any of the tested conditions for both Nafion coated and Abbott Navigator sensor. To verify that Matrigel remains on the sensor tip rather than being stripped off once submerged in buffer or when adding additional Matrigel layers, pictures were taken at various Matrigel coating stages utilizing a dissecting microscope connected to a camera. FIG. 14A shows the sensor tip with the addition of 5 ul of Matrigel. FIGS. 14B and 14C shows the sensor tip after overnight drying of Matrigel on sensor tip and with re-hydration of Matrigel in H2O, respectively. Example 5 Effect of the Basement Membrane on Glucose Sensor Function in Vitro To determine if matrix Matrigel is a physical barrier to glucose diffusion, the in vitro response of glucose sensors was determined with and without Matrigel coating. For these studies, glucose was added to the sensor (with or without Matrigel) after stabilization of the sensors in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and sensor response was followed (FIG. 15). Next, the sensor was removed from the PBS/glucose solution, washed in PBS and then a Matrigel coating (10 mg/ml) was added to the working electrode of the glucose sensors. After polymerization of the Matrigel, the glucose sensors were retested at 37° C. as described above Representative results is presented in FIG. 15, in which Sr indicates the sensor response (e.g. sensor drift) and tsd indicates sensor delay. For these studies it was assumed that glucose addition to PBS resulted in a homogenous solution instantaneously (time delay=0). As can be seen in FIG. 15A there was no significant difference in the Sr or tsd when we compared the Matrigel coated (FIG. 15B) versus sensors without Matrigel (FIG. 15A) coatings. This preliminary data supports the previous in vitro and in vivo data that supports the use of matricies such as Matrigel in enhancing sensor function. Example 6 Impact of Basement Membrane on Glucose Sensor Function In Vivo The effect of Matrigel on sensor function in vivo was determined. Prior to implantation sensors were treated with Matrigel. For that, 5 ul of Matrigel (growth factor enriched) were added to the tip of the sensor and allowed to dry. Two additional Matrigel coatings were added to the sensor with drying steps between each step. Sensors were implanted the day following Matrigel treatment. Sensors were implanted in the presence (Matrigel+sensor) or absence (buffer+sensor) of Matrigel. Immediately after sensor implantation, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was initiated using the mouse system. Glucose-derived current data were obtained at 60-sec intervals. Blood glucose reference measurements were obtained periodically over the 14-day implantation period, using blood obtained from the tail vein (−0.3 uL) and a FreeStyle Blood Glucose Monitor. First CGM of non-Matrigel treated sensors implanted in normal mice (CD-1) was evaluated. As can be seen in FIG. 16A, sensor output only shows one sensor drift at around day 3 in the first 6 DPI. However, at approximately 1-week post implantation the sensor experienced a sharp decline in sensor performance. Although a sensor signal is still being measured, it appears to be more random and it does not reflect the glucose level of the mouse (FIG. 16A). Alternatively, sensors treated with Matrigel prior to implantation performed exceptional during the entire 14-day testing period (FIG. 16B). Specifically, blood glucose levels for both sensors implanted in the mice generally ranged from 80 to 150 mg of glucose/dL of blood, with CGS current ranging from 1 to 9 nA for non-treated Matrigel sensors and 4 to 8 nA for Matrigel treated sensors. It appears that Matrigel enhances sensor performance by both protecting the sensor from biofouling as well as protecting the tissue surrounding the sensor from tissue toxic factor released from the sensor (H2O2 and gluconic acid). In summary, these studies clearly demonstrate that Matrigel can dramatically enhance sensor function in vivo. These studies also show that the uses of bio-matrices such as Matrigel with glucose sensors, dramatically increases the in vivo lifetime of an implantable glucose sensor. Example 7 Usage of “Dry” Bio-Matrices to Deliver Adenovector Genes in vitro GFP-adenovirus was used as a gene transfer marker and indicator cells A375 to determine the ability of air dried/4° C. bio-matrices to release functional adenovirus. For these studies GFP-adenoviruses were added to buffer, Matrigel (10 mg/ml) or collagen (0.1%) at varying final concentrations (i.e. serial dilutions). 200 ul of each of the resulting solutions were added to individual wells of a 24-well plate and allowed to dry overnight at 4° C. The next day A375 indicator cells were added to each of the wells and allowed to adhere and were cultured overnight at 37 C and 5% CO2. As can be seen in FIG. 17A, C, E bright field photographs A375 cells were viable 24 hr post seeding to the wells. Additionally, under all conditions A375 cell were bright green when viewed under fluorescence microscopy (FIG. 17B, D, F), indicating that under all conditions adenovirus were viable and successfully transferred the GFP gene to the A375 cells. If the GFP adenoviruses were not viable after drying, the A375 cells would not have turned green under fluorescence microscopy. Analysis of the serial dilution results of these studies also indicated that the GFP-Adenovirus were 10-100× times more viable when GFP-adenovirus were dried in the presence of Matrigel or collagen when compared to drying in buffer only. These studies clearly support the concept that drying adenovectors in the presence of bio-matrices preserves virus infectivity. Thus, this supports the idea that “dry” adenovector-bio-matrices can be used to locally deliver genes that are important in controlling TRT at sites of sensor implantation. We anticipate that if we utilize lyophilization to dry matrices we will likely get even greater adenovector gene transfer, when compared to air-drying. Example 8 Uses of “Dry” GFP-Adenovector/Bio-Matrix Coated Glucose Sensors to Deliver Genes to Cells In Vitro Since glucose sensors have different coatings than cell culture dishes and also contain glucose oxidase, which releases both H2O2 and gluconic acid as breakdown products of glucose, the cell culture studies described above were extended by coating Abbott Navigator sensors with GFP-Adenovirus/Bio-matrix coatings (Matrigel) and air drying them overnight at 4° C. The resulting Adenovirus/Bio-matrix coated sensors (Matrigel or collagen) were then placed in a cell culture dish, and media containing A375 indicator cells were added to the well. As can be seen in FIG. 18A (GFP-adenovector-Matrigel coating) and FIG. 18B (GFP-adenovector-collagen coating), air-drying of the GFP-adenovector in Matrigel or collagen remained functional. This is indicated by the ability of the GFP-adenovectors to transfer the GFP to the indicator A375 cells in vitro. It should be noted that rehydration of the Matrigel by the media causes significant swelling of the dry Matrigel into a small “mound” around the sensor (see FIG. 14 above). Since Matrigel auto-fluoresces the rehydrated Matrigel can easily be seen surrounding the sensor in the 10× photomicrographs in FIG. 18A. These sensor studies clearly demonstrate that adenoviruses can be dried in the presence of bio-matrices and remain functional. These studies support the feasibility of using dry bio-matrix coatings for local/targeted gene transfer studies at sites of glucose sensor implantation in vivo Example 9 Genetic Engineering and Gene Therapy Example 9A Establishing hCAR Transgenic Mice Colony To expedite the adenovector studies, hCAR mice were obtained. Lymphocytes are known to have low levels of CAR and as such are not infectable with adenovectors. In order to confirm that lymphocytes derived from hCAR mice are infectable with adenoviruses, spleen cells were isolated and infected using an adenovirus carrying the gene for GFP. As expected, spleen cells from hCAR mice were infectable with GFP adenoviruses (FIGS. 19A and 19B), but control spleen cells from C57BL/J were not (see FIGS. 19C and 19D). Example 9B In Vitro Expression of mVEGF, hVEGF and hHGF by Mouse hCAR BM-ECP after Exposure to Adenovectors Containing Genes for Angiogenic Factors (AF) Once it was established that hCAR derived lymphocytes were transfectable with GFP adenoviruses, AF expression was determined in bone marrow derived endothelial cell progenitors (BM-ECP) transfected with AF adenoviruses. The AF adenoviruses used for this study were mVEGF, hVEGF and hHGF. The controls for the AF studies were: 1) GFP adenovectors and 2) BM-ECP treated with control media (buffer). After transfection with the viruses or exposure to the control buffer, individual cell culture supernatants were obtained at various times post exposure. AF Expression (mVEGF, hVEGF and hHGF expression) in these supernatants was quantified by ELISA. Control BM-ECP cells were isolated from bone marrow from normal (non-hCAR) mice and treated in an identical fashion. BM-ECP isolated form normal mice (i.e. non-hCAR mice) did not produce any significant AF under any treatment condition (data not shown). Additionally, buffer and GFP-adenovirus treated hCAR BM-ECP also did not produce any significant AF in vitro (FIG. 20). Alternatively, hCAR BM-ECP exposed to the AF adenovectors produced rapid expression of the AF factors for all the adenovectors (i.e. mVEGF, hVEGF and hHGF transfected hCAR BM-ECP cells) see FIG. 20. Thus, the GFP and ELISA data clearly indicate that one can 1) infect ECP cells with adenovirus, and 2) that these infected cells clearly produce the specific AF's when exposed to AF adenovirus vectors in vitro. Example 9C hCAR Adenovirus Enhances Infectivity by Adenoviruses and Angiogenic Factor Expression Previous studies have demonstrated that increased expression of CAR on cell surfaces enhances adenovirus infectivity and resulting gene expression in cell. To test this possibility hCAR derived ECP were infected with adeno-GFP vectors with or without prior exposure to hCAR adenovirus. As expected non-adeno-GFP infected cells showed no fluorescence (FIG. 20B), cells infected with GFP-Adv (FIG. 9D) became fluorescence but cells infected with viruses GFP-Adv then hCAR-Adv display a dramatic increase in fluorescence (FIG. 20F). FIG. 20A is the brightfield control to FIG. 20B. FIG. 20C is the brightfield control to FIG. 20D. FIG. 20E is the brightfield control to FIG. 20F. This data clearly demonstrated that the hCAR adenovirus is a potent enhancer of Adenovirus infectivity and gene expression likely as a result of allowing super infection of the target cells. To extend these studies the ability of pre-infection of target cells with hCAR adenovirus was determined in order to determine enhanced angiogenic factor expression for these cells. hCAR derived BM-ECP were treated with 1) buffer, 2) GFP-adenovirus, 3) HGF-Adenovirus or 4) hCAR-adenovirus followed by exposure to hHGF-adenovirus. hHGF expression was only detected in the hHGF infected BM-ECP cells (FIG. 21). Cells infected with hCAR-adenovirus plus hHGF-adenovirus displayed a 3 to 5-fold higher hHGF expression when compared to the hHGF-adenovirus infected cells. The peak hHGF production by hCAR-hHGF cells in vitro was 48 hrs.-post infections with 15.2 ng/hHGF/ml versus 2.8 ng/hHGF/ml for hHGF cells not previously treated with hCAR (FIG. 21). No hHGF protein production was seen in cells treated with buffer or GFP (FIG. 21). The ELISA data clearly indicate that BM-ECP cells treated with hCAR in addition to hHGF significantly enhances angiogenic factor expression. Example 10 P39 Adenovirus Enhances Angiogenic Factor Expression To determine whether PR39 adenovirus is able to enhance angiogenic factor expression i.e. VEGF, human A375 cells were treated with buffer, GFP-adenovirus or PR39-Adenovirus, and VEGF expression determined by ELISA analysis of the resulting cell culture supernatants. Since A375 cells are human cells they naturally express low levels of VEGF at baseline (buffer) and control (GFP-adenovirus) (FIG. 22). However, A375 cells infected with adenovirus carrying gene for PR39 significantly enhanced hVEGF expression by 2.7 fold 24 hours post infection, 6.1-fold 48 hours, and 9.1-fold 72 hours post infection with PR-39. The peak hVEGF production in vitro was 72-hours post infection and 4.8 ng/hVEGF/ml versus 0.5 ng hVEGF/ml in A375 cells treated with either buffer or GFP (FIG. 22). The data clearly indicate that PR39 can induce VEGF expression in cells likely by inducing the HIF-1a pathway resulting in expression of the potent angiogenic factor VEGF. Example 11 HCAR Adenovirus plus P39 Adenovirus Enhances Angiogenic Factor Expression in Mouse Fat Cells For these studies mouse fat cells were plated at identical numbers (106 cells/well) and incubated with the various Adv of buffer for 24 hr., then the cells were washed and fresh media was added. At 24, 48 and 72 hr. post incubation the culture media was removed and assayed for mouse VEGF by ELISA. As can be seen in FIG. 23A the mVEGF-AdV induced significantly higher mVEGF expression (Approximately 200 pg/ml by 72 hrs.), where the levels in both GFP-AdV and buffer treated cells was virtually undetectable (FIG. 23C). The results of these studies clearly demonstrate PR-39-peptide AdV to induce mVEGF expression (Approximately 200 pg of mVEGF/ml by 72 hrs.), in the mouse fat cells (FIG. 23B). Finally, since cells that carry the AdV receptor CAR (see background) can not only be infected by Advs but with increased expression of CAR can be super-infected by multiple Advs Therefore, we determined that if fat cells are pre-infected with Adv that expresses hCAR that we would get higher expression of hCAR on the surface of the cells which would allow even greater infection by another AdV, i.e. PR-39. As can be seen in FIG. 23C, pre-incubating the mouse fat cells with the hCAR Adv resulted in a super induction of mVEGF in the same mouse fat cells (i.e. nearly 800 pg of mVEGF/ml of media), nearly 4 times the levels of mVEGF induced by mVEGF-Adv or PR-39-AdV alone (FIG. 23C). Combined mVEGF-AdV plus PR-39 AdV mVEGF expression levels seen in FIG. 23C, were over twice the additive levels of mVEGF-AdV plus PR-39-AdV thus supporting the possible synergy in gene expression when hCAR expression is induced on cell surfaces. Thus, hCAR-AdV can be used in combination with other AdV to enhance gene expression directly in vivo or as part of genetically engineering cells in vitro for in vivo use. Prophetic Example 12 Fibronectin (FN) can be used as a crosslinking agent for extracellular matrix (ECM) such as basement membranes and collagen to hold the basement or collagen together (make ECM stronger). FN can be first coated on the device (acts as an adhesive), and then ECM can be added to stick the ECM to the devices more tightly/stronger. FN can be added as a coating at any stage of the coating process and even can be used during one of the hydration steps in the form of a solution. FN can be used as an adhesive between layers with or without hydration steps. Drying steps with FN and other ECM are believed to increase the crosslinking of FN to ECM. Also the drying step can increase the tightness by which additional factors such as cytokines, chemokines, growth factors and inhibitors of inflammation and fibrosis (CGFI) bind to the FN and the other ECM present in the coating layers Because of the ability of FN to bind various peptides and proteins, it can be utilized as a drug delivery system when it is added into the extracellular matrix. For example, FN can be added to basement membranes containing factors, and then the factors are released from the ECM in order to benefit the surrounding tissue, such as by inducing vessel formation, suppressing inflammation and suppressing fibrosis. It is believed that the “dry” matrices may actually be more efficient in retaining proteins and peptides (i.e. slower release kinetics) when compared to the “wet” matrices. Factors such as cytokines chemokines, growth factors antibodies recombinant proteins as well as inhibitors of inflammation and fibrosisi can be cross-linked directly to the matrix using a cross-linking agent. Factors also can be indirectly crosslinked to the extracellular matrix using fibronectin or fibronectin related peptides that bind to fibronectin (i.e. fibronectin binding domains or peptides fragments of fibrin, collagen or RGD peptides). The fibronectin molecule or fragments act as a bridge to link the various CGFI to the various bioactive matrices (see FIG. 25). Additionally, CGFI often bind to matrices as a mechanism for long-term localization of these factors in tissue sites (e.g. wounds and ulcers). Generally, these bound factors interact directly with cells that are in contact with the matrix itself. This solid phase activation of cells is frequently referred to, as “you are what you sit on.” It is believed that having rapidly releasing factors (e.g. anti-inflammatory) working together with slow releasing or bound factors is beneficial to control delayed tissue reactions such as fibrosis and neovascularization. It is believed that rapidly releasing anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-10, IL-1ra, and sTNFR are useful in stopping inflammation, where as anti-fibrotic agents such as P144, sTGFR or anti-CD40 are most useful in a delayed release or even remain bound to the matrix, thereby inactivating in-fluxing fibroblasts and suppressing fibrosis. Additionally, late releasing angiogenic factors are expected to be useful in promoting angiogenesis at a later time frame, i.e. after the inflammatory reactions. Factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) have impacts on the tissue reaction triad (TRT) of inflammation fibrosis and vessel regression. at sites of sensor implantation shown by suppressing both inflammation and fibrosis, as well as promote angiogenesis. It is believed that the 2-peptide systems (PR39 and P144) have a significant impact on TRT related cell activation. The release profiles for the various factors under both wet and dry preparation is different. It is expected that the dry protocols will result in matrices that bind larger amounts of factors and retain them for longer periods once they are dehydrated. It is known that a number of factors can exert their biological action when incorporated into Matrigel, collagen or fibrin e.g. VEGF, FGF, PR39. It is expected that as the concentration of the individual matrix is increased, its total binding capacity also increases, and its rate of factor release decreases. Matrigel (BD Biosciences) is expected to be a particularly effective wet or dry matrix for these embodiments. Each of the component matrices of Matrigel has specific binding sites for numerous factors and receptors (either on cells or free as soluble receptors). It is expected that fibrin matrix is particularly effective in delivering factors that control inflammation (IL-10, IL-1ra and sTNFR) and fibrosis (e.g. P144, sTGFR, anti-CD40 and HGF). It is expected that a mix of Matrigel plus Fibrin with the various factors provides a good combination of matrix strength with a wide range of binding capacities for the various candidate factors (see FIG. 25). The addition of fibronectin to the Matrigel-Fibrin combination matrix would add even more tensile strength as well as additional diversity of factor binding capacity. In one embodiment, the various CGFI are either coupled to collagen/fibrin heparin or integrin binding peptide sequence (RGD) peptides using commercial cross-linkers (Pierce Chemical) and then added to fibronectin, which in turn will bind the CGFI-peptide complex (FIG. 25). The CGFI-peptide fibronectin complex is then added to Matrigel, fibrin and or collagen, to which it binds (FIG. 25). The resulting CGFI-peptide-fibronectin-matrix complexes are used in vivo to establish a very controlled distribution of the CGFI with the matrix. Since fibronectin has both COOH and disulfide cross-linking the CGFI it can be chemically cross-linked thru these residues (FIG. 36). Because CGFI normally interact in vivo with the various bio-matrices used it is extremely likely that all the factors will be functionally active. The kinetic of release of the various factors must also be considered in choosing the appropriate combinations. Generally, one would expect that rapidly releasing anti-inflammatory factors such as IL-10, IL-1ra, and sTNFR would be useful in stopping inflammation, while anti-fibrotic agents such as P144, sTGFR or anti-CD40 would be most useful if they showed delayed release or even remain bound to the matrix, thereby inactivating in-fluxing fibroblasts and suppressing fibrosis. Additionally, late releasing angiogenic factors would likely be useful in promoting angiogenesis at a later time frame, i.e. after the inflammatory reactions. It is expected that the dry protocols will result in matrices that bind larger amounts of factors and retain them for longer periods once they are dehydrated. FIG. 25 is a diagram of the FN molecule with its distinct “backbone” (102), showing ways in which FN can bind with a variety of matrices (104-110) and factors (122-130) at specific binding sites within the FN structure. The ability of FN to bind matrices such as basement membrane, fibrin, collagen etc. (104-110) allows FN to be an effective biologic crosslinking agent. Since FN has a specific binding site for heparin, it can also bind a number of factors that are tissue response modifiers, such as VEGFs that induce new vessel formation in injured (TRMs). This binding can be the result of the structure of the molecule such as heparin (110) or through common peptide sequences such as integrin binding peptide (RDG) sequences (108). Additionally various peptides know to bind to FN can act as a bridge or crosslinking agent (126). Additionally other peptides and various chemical crosslinking agents (114 and 116) can bind factors such as cytokines, growth factors and inhibitors to the FN backbone. Alternatively because FN has reactive elements such as sulfhydryl's (118) and COOH groups these can be derivatives to allow covalent linking of various TRMs to the FN molecule. Ultimately, with the degradation of FN in vivo a wide variety of TRMs will be released from the FN derivatives. It should be noted that the modified FNs described above will have at least one modification per FN molecule, and can be used individually or in any combination or ratio of modified and or unmodified FNs. Embodiments of FIGS. 26-37 FIG. 26A shows a sensor assembly with a collar. The sensor assembly 400 includes electronics 402, a sensing element support 406 with a sensing element 406 at the tip 408. The sensor is covered by a polymer to prevent influx of interfering substances into the sensor sensing element 404. When a sensor is implanted into the skin it creates an open wound 410 with a risk of infections 412 as well as dampness to the upper skin cell layers (e.g. epithelial cells). For the sensor in FIG. 26B, the sensing element support 406′ has an antimicrobial collar 414 configured to be positioned on both sides of the point at which the support enters the tissue 410. A coating 422 containing no additives, or tissue response modifier, such as those listed above, can be included within the collar or disposed between the collar 408 and the sensing element 406 (422 in FIG. 26D). This configuration prevents infection and inflammation that otherwise may occur, as shown in FIG. 26C, within the tissue around the sensor and support due to, e.g., bacteria 413. While the coating usually is rehydrated after implantation to minimize discomfort to the patient, the coating 422, 428, 432 on the coated sensor (416, 418 and 420 in FIG. 26B) also can be rehydrated before implantation. In embodiments, the coating can be applied immediately before assembly, in which case initial dehydration would not be required. FIG. 27 shows the rehydrated version of the sensor assembly 450 with the coating 402 completely surrounding the implanted portion of the sensor assembly 450. In this embodiment there are no additives added to the collars or sleeves, but the collars 452 and sleeves 454 act here as mechanical plugs to prevent infection and “shock absorbers” to prevent tissue damage as a result of mechanical movement of the implanted sensor in the skin. Generally the collars and sleeves are dehydrated prior to implantation for ease of implantation for the patient and the clinician. The collars and sleeves can be hydrated pre sensor implantation if advantageous. In this embodiment both a collar and sleeve coating are included in this compound device (458 and 460). FIG. 28 shows that ECMs with and without anti-microbial agents and TRMs can be incorporated into the ECM collars 502 and sleeves 504 as part of the cycles of coating, dehydration, rehydration and dehydration. When hydrated pre or post sensor implantation the anti-microbial agents and/or TRMs are released for the hydrated collars 508 and sleeves 510 and control infection inflammation, wound healing and fibrosis at the implantation site. FIG. 29 shows that TRMs can be incorporated into the collars 552 and sleeves 554 pre-implantation. This incorporation can induce proliferation of skin surface cells 562 or blood vessels 564 to overcome tissue damage at the implantation sites. As such, sensor function is maintained or even enhanced due to maintaining tissue integrity and in growth of blood vessels, which assures real-time blood glucose determination by the glucose sensor. FIG. 30 demonstrates that multiple anti-microbial agents and TRMs can be incorporated in the collars and sleeves to achieve maximal positive impact on preventing infection, tissue trauma, inflammation, and in promoting wound healing and neovascularization. Dehydrated collar 602 is hydrated to form hydrated collar 608. Dehydrated sleeve 604 is hydrated to form sleeve 616. As with the embodiment of FIG. 29, this can induce proliferation of skin surface cells 610 or blood vessels 614 to overcome tissue damage at the implantation site. FIG. 31 demonstrates that collar length can be extended to maximize anti-microbial and TRMs delivery at the implantation sites to various depths in the tissue. This also demonstrates that the collars 652 (dehydrated, 656 (hydrated) can be extended into the tissue, not just on the surface to maximize the mechanical “plug” effect and thereby decrease infections as well as mechanical damage to the upper layers of the skin. This extended collar assures continuity from the surface of the implant site into the depth of the implanted tissue. In embodiments, an extended collar has a length of 2 to 50 mm, or 5-20 mm, or 2-10 mm. The diameter at the larger end of the plug typically is in the range of 3-20 mm, or 5-15 mm, or 5-10 mm. In embodiments, a collar that is not “extended has a length of 2-10 mm, or 2-7 mm, or 3-5 mm. The diameter at the larger end of the plug typically is in the range of 3-20 mm, or 2-7 mm, or 3-5 mm. FIG. 32 demonstrates the impact of placement of a collar 704 around an infusion cannula 702 with and without additives. This cannula with a collar can be hydrated pre or post implantation, and provide a wound “plug” 710, 712 to prevent infection and tissue trauma. The addition of various antimicrobial agents and TRMs further prevent infection, inflammation and fibrosis and promote healing of the implantation sites both at upper layers (epithelial lay) as well as the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. FIG. 33 shows an infusion system with an infusion pump 752 having tubing 754 connected to an infusion set housing 756, which includes an insulin supply/reservoir (usually to seal tube 758) frequently there is an inert cannula support (758 and 760) as well as an adhesive strip 762. This configuration does not include a collar. In FIG. 34, a one-piece collar-sleeve combination 818 is disposed on the outer surface of the tissue 814 in which the cannula is implanted. Again an adhesive strip 812 holds the cannula in place on the outer surface 813 of the tissue 814. The infusion set cannula is inserted into the skin using a needle (which is inside the cannula) to pierce the skin, thereby allowing the cannula to move into the underlying skin layers using minimal force. Once implanted the needle is removed and the infusion set is connected to the pump via a long plastic tubing. Once the tubing is connected to the infusion pump fluids can be infused into the tissue or vessel as needed. FIGS. 35-36 show photographs demonstrating the application of coatings in accordance with embodiments described herein. The method is described above in connection with sensors. FIG. 37 describes the procedure to multi-coat surgical meshes that are used in reconstructive surgery including hernia surgery. For this procedure surgical mesh (902 and 904) is obtained from a medical supply house, sterilized and placed in sterile containers. The mesh is suspended in a laminar hood to assure sterility. Next the mesh is dip coated by immersion in ECM, in this case in basement membrane (Matrigel) solution and suspended in the laminar flow hood to allow drying 906. The BM coated mesh is next allowed to dry, followed by repeated cycles of addition of BM and drying (907 and 908). After at least 1 cycle (in this case shown in the photographs there were 10 cycles of coating and drying), the coated mesh was rehydrated 918 in water to remove accumulated salts 920 and then allowed to dry 922. It should be noted that the coating not only covers the mesh fibers 910 but also fills the mesh pores 912, 914. Filling these pores likely will increase the biocompatibility of the surgical mesh when implanted in vivo. After drying the coated mesh can be directly implanted in a patient or animal who need this type of mesh, or it can be rehydrated and then implanted in vivo. Modified Basement Membrane Preparations In embodiments, salts, glucose, individual amino acids, vitamins, and other low molecular weight components can be removed from the basement membrane to form a modified basement membrane preparation before it is coated on the device. These components can be removed from the basement membrane-media combination by a suitable technique depending upon the size of materials to be removed. Techniques for removing the low molecular weight materials include but are not limited to dialysis, buffer exchange, diafiltration, precipitation, gel filtration, affinity chromatography and electrophoresis. If this type of process is used, it is not necessary to rinse the basement membrane at the time of rehydration. Depending on the final use of the basement membrane, the separation technique can involve a suitable molecular weight cut-off. In embodiments, this cut-off might be 2000 daltons, or 10,000 daltons, or another value. In this embodiment, the dehydrated modified basement membrane can be rehydrated using a liquid injected before or after the basement membrane-coated device is inserted in biological tissue, or the interstitial fluid themselves can hydrate the basement membrane. FIG. 38 is a flow chart showing one embodiment for preparing a modified basement membrane preparation. The steps shown on the flow charts are described below in Example 13. FIG. 39 shows formulations of two types of media used in making basement membranes sold commercially. The commercially available basement membrane are sold in a form in which they have already been placed in media, such as, but not limited to RPMI1640 from Sigma Chemical Co. or Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DME) from Sigma Chemical Co. RPMI-1640 contains inorganic salts, amino acids, vitamins and other materials. The inorganic salts include calcium nitrate, magnesium sulfate, potassium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride and sodium phosphate dibasic (anhydrous). DME contains inorganic salts, amino acids, vitamins and other materials. The inorganic salts include calcium chloride, ferric nitrite, magnesium sulfate (anhydrous), potassium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride and sodium phosphate monobasic (anhydrous). FIG. 40 is a set of photos showing salt crystals in basement membrane. FIG. 41 includes photos showing the effect of pre-dialyzed and post-dialyzed basement membrane on tissue surrounding implanted sensors. Example 13 Dialysis of Basement Membrane A commercial basement membrane was obtained in which the concentration of basement membrane was 10-20 mg basement membrane/ml of media. The mouse basement membrane used in these studies was from Becton Dickenson Bioscience, sold under the name Matrigel®. The tissue culture media which contained the basement membrane when it was purchased was DME or RPM11640 from Sigma Chemical Co. According to Sigma Chemical Co., these media typically contain greater than 10-15 mg of salts, glucose, and amino acids (in total) per ml of media. The basement membrane was dialyzed using the procedures and equipment of Pierce (www.piercenet.com). 2 ml of basement membrane was put in a small container that had a 2000 dalton molecular weight cut-off membrane as the bottom wall. This container was placed at the top of a tube containing 48 ml of water in order that the membrane was immersed in the water. The material was dialyzed a first time using the 2000 dalton molecular weight cut off dialysis membrane for 24 hr. (1/25 dilution) at 4 Deg. C. in water on a platform-type rotator. A portion of the material then underwent a second dialysis using a 2000 dalton molecular weight cut off dialysis membrane for 24 hr. (1/25 dilution) at 4 Deg. C, using a tube of water and the platform-type rotator. A portion of the material then underwent a final dialysis with the dilution of BM of 1/625. As a result, the media (not including the basement membrane) contained 0.016 to 0.024 mg/ml salts, glucose and amino acids. Three separate 20-microliter samples of basement membrane (in the media) from the experiment described in the previous paragraph were placed on microscopic slides and dried for 24 hours at 37 Deg. C. The first sample was not subjected to any dialysis. The second sample was subjected to the first dialysis only, and the third sample was subjected to the both the first dialysis and the second dialysis. After drying at room temperature, the samples were examined to determine the presence and size of any salt crystals. The results are shown in FIG. 40. As can be seen in the photographs, a large crystalline conglomerate having a diameter of about 20 mm was present in the first sample that had not undergone dialysis, and the crystal diameters were about 2-3 mm. The second sample had medium-sized salt crystal conglomerates. The third sample had no easily visible salt crystals. As shown in the photographs, the dialysis removed most of the salt from the media. It can be assumed that the other materials falling below the 2000 dalton molecular weight cut-off also were removed. Example 14 Coating Sensor with Modified Basement Membrane Preparation A sample of the modified basement membrane preparation that had undergone the two-stage dilution described above was coated on a glucose sensor by depositing the basement membrane on a sensor dropwise, three drops at a time and drying the coating at room temperature. This procedure was repeated until a total of about 100 microliters of basement membrane had been deposited. A mesh made of polyester was separately coated. A collar for a cannula also was formed from the modified basement membrane preparation. After the coated sensor was dried for 24 hours, it was placed in the subcutaneous tissue of a mouse. After 14 days, a histologic evaluation of the implantation site was conducted by euthanizing the mouse, removing the tissue, processing the tissue, and evaluating it microscopically. As is shown in FIGS. 41C and 41D, there was minimal, if any, injury or inflammation of the tissue, with little, if any, degradation of the basement membrane. Because of the dialysis, it was not necessary to remove salts, glucose, and amino acids at the time of rehydration. A control experiment was conducted using a sample of the basement membrane (in media—as sold commercially) that did not undergo any dialysis. A glucose sensor of the same type used above was coated in the manner described above. After the sensor was dried for 24 hours, it was placed in the subcutaneous tissue of a mouse. After 14 days, a histologic evaluation of the implantation site was conducted by euthanizing the mouse, removing the tissue, processing the tissue, and evaluating it microscopically. As is shown in FIGS. 41A and 41B, there was substantial injury and inflammation of the tissue, as well as extensive degradation of the basement membrane. Degradation of the basement membrane was caused by proteases and hydrolases from white blood cells that dissolve and degrade matrices including basement membrane. Example 15 The procedures of Examples 13 and 14 were generally repeated using commercially available Trevigen basement membrane called Cultrex® Basement Membrane Extract, Type 2, PathClear® (purified from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor). The results of salt crystal size without dialysis, after 1 stage of dialysis and after 2 stages of dialysis were similar to the results of Example 13. Examination of the tissue after 14 days showed the same effects as with the Matrigel®, i.e. tissue inflammation and basement membrane degradation when pre-dialyzed basement membrane was used, and minimal tissue inflammation and basement membrane degradation when dialyzed basement membrane was used.
