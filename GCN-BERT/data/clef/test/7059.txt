Under an argon (Ar) atmosphere, 20.0 g of Compound A was stirred in 300 ml of THF at −78° C. for 10 minutes, and 21.7 ml of n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) with 1.6 M concentration was slowly added thereto dropwisely using a dropping funnel, followed by additionally stirring for 30 minutes. Then, 7.05 ml of trimethyl borate (B(OMe)3) was slowly added thereto dropwisely using a dropping funnel and additionally stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. After that, 300 ml of 1 M HCl solution was added and extracted once. Then, the product thus obtained was additionally extracted three times using water and toluene. The organic layer thus obtained was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated, and residues were separated by column chromatography to obtain 4.78 g (yield 30%) of Compound H as a white solid.
