CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS In Part of claims benefit of Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/725,534 Filing date: Nov. 13, 2012 FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH NA SEQUENCE LISTING NA BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION RTA or ready to assemble products are very common items found in the current market place. For manufacturing and shipping large items the advantages and cost savings of RTA is widely accepted. Finished wood or casegoods furniture is no exception. However, currently furniture customers and retailers still face challenges finding and purchasing quality RTA upholstered furniture. The invention of this special connector and the use of more standard type connectors for assembling the different components as described will solve this problem. Upholstered furniture usually consists of seat, back and arms in various shapes and sizes. A frame consisting of these parts is joined together using staples, wood dowels and/or glue. This frame moves through manufacturing in stages adding supporting material, springs, padding and covered in upholstery materials as a single large unit. Then packaged for shipping. A much more efficient method is to manufacture individual components through an assembly line designed for that component. Each component will be packaged together using much less space, thus saving substance-sully on shipping, handling and warehousing costs. Assembling together the components using this special connections and metal brackets and bolts provide a much stronger frame. This compared to standard manufacturing methods using staples, wood dowels and/or glue. Quality ready to assemble upholstery requires that each component to completely covered or upholstered and finished. After assembly and sitting upright their should be no visual signs of connectors and no gaps or movement between any parts. The style, design and comfort should not be limited to only one or two choices. Previous attempts at ready to assemble upholstery has not been able to address all these issues. Their are three major points of connection or stress areas of where the resting arm attaches to the back in a standard upholstered frame. This embodiment addresses these areas that has been very problematic in ready to assemble components. These areas will be described and shown in greater detail in the drawings and detailed summary of the said embodiment. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows an exploded front perspective view of one embodiment of the chair in accordance with the invention. The seat and backrest cushions have been removed as to provide a clearer view of the said embodiment. FIG. 2 is a perspective view of the backside of the chair. Thus showing the right side arm component 2 and the back component 1. The back component is shown as a wireframe with the exception of the internal back post 12 show as a solid part. FIG. 3 is an enlarged view from FIG. 2 showing the internal back post 12 within back component 1 assembled to the arm component 2. FIG. 4 shows from FIG. 3 the plane in which the cross sectional view is taken in the following FIG. 5. FIG. 5 is a cross sectional view of arm component 2 and the internal back post 12 within back component 1. Thus illustrating the assembly motion of said invention. FIG. 5A is a cross sectional view showing the motion of assembly of said invention. FIG. 5B is a cross sectional view showing the completed motion of assembly of said embodiment. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT With reference to FIG. 1, this is an illustrated exploded view of a chair embodying the present invention. While this is one embodiment of said invention, that is should be know that the invention is equally applicable to sofas and or any other item of seating furniture that includes but not limited to a seat, arm rest and back rest. The chair comprises of components, back 1, right arm 2, left arm 3, seat rail 4, seat deck 5, legs 6, metal parts 7-8, guide block 9, and connecting bolt 10, mounted into components arm 2-3. The components 1-6 can be built from wood or engineered wood, plastics and any other materials of sufficient strength. These components can also be covered in any suitable materials of fabrics, leathers or natural fibers. Referring now to FIG. 2 showing components back 1 and right arm 2. The component back 1 is shown in a perspective wire frame illustrating the internal part back post 12. With back post 12 is shown as a solid part to better illustrate the assembly process of the said invention. In the process of assembly the component arm 2, with connecting bolt 10 is inserted into the keyhole 13 of the component back 2. The keyhole is one aspect of named 13 keyhole slot, this keyhole which also includes an internal tapered ramp of which all is mechanically machined into the part back post 12. This insertion of connecting bolt 10 into the machined slot 13, in which the head of the said bolt sliding up the machined ramp and results will be fully described hereafter. Referring now to FIG. 3 showing the final result of the connecting bolt 10 into the machined slot 13 of which is an integral part of the back post 12. The results as shown in FIG. 3 is a mechanical engagement of component arm 2 with component back 1. To better illustrate this mechanical motion of engagement, a cut-away sectional view of the machined slot 13 is required. The illustrated plane of the cut-away sectional view is shown if FIG. 4. Referring now to FIG. 5 illustrating the sectioned plane of component arm 2 and part back post 12. This illustrated plane cuts vertically through the center length of machined slot 13, as shown previously in FIG. 4. The part connecting bolt 10 of which is screwed into component arm 2 in a predetermined spot at the correct angle that is precisely of the same angle and degree cut of the machined ramp 13 in part back post 12. This precision fit allows the bottom surface of the screw head of part connecting bolt 10 to slide along the ramped path of the machined slot 13. Inserting the part connecting bolt 10 into the keyhole of the machined slot 13, as shown by the arrow in FIG. 5, begins with sufficient space between component arm 2 and component back 1. As shown if FIG. 5A, the downward motion push of the part back post 12, as shown by the vertical arrows, allows the part connecting bolt 10 to slide along the machined ramp 13. The sliding of the part connecting bolt 10 along the machined path 13, will bring together the component arm 2 and the component back 1, as shown by the horizontal arrows in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B. As shown if FIG. 5B, at the point in which connecting bolt 10 slides along the path of the machined ramp 13, reaches the end if the slot, the component arm 2 and component back 1 will essentially bring together with no space between the 2 said components. Thus the chair back and arm is securely attached together at a height above the bottom connecting point in a typical arm to back connection. Once the connection of the arm is made at this bottom arm to back connection and also to the front seat portion by means illustrated in FIG. 1, thus providing a very strong 3 point rectangle path of connection points, with no visible signs of the connections or connectors. 1.
