(96-3) Synthesis of (S)-4-chloro-N-(2-hydroxy-1-{3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl}ethyl)-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)benzamide (Compound 96)
To a solution of N-{(1S)-2-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-{3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl} ethyl} -4-chloro-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)benzamide (176 mg, 0.3 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (4 mL) was added a solution (900 Âµl) of 1 mol/L tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. Thereafter, water was added to stop the reaction, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The extracts were mixed, washed with a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure, and the obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography followed by washing with a mixed solution of diethyl ether-hexane (1:9) to obtain the title compound 26 mg (yield 18%).
