FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to heterologous polypeptide expression and secretion by filamentous fungi and vectors and processes for expression and secretion of such polypeptides. More particularly, the invention discloses the use of a signal sequence form an aspartic protease obtained from Trichoderma and referred to as an NSP24 signal sequence. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Host cells such as yeast, filamentous fungi and bacteria have been used to express and secrete proteins that are foreign or heterologous to the hosts. Production of these foreign or heterologous proteins in yeast, filamentous fungi and bacteria involves the expression and partial or complete purification from the host cell. Purification can be greatly simplified if the heterologous proteins are secreted from the cell into the media. Proteins that are secreted from the cell possess a signal peptide sequence. In the cell, the signal peptide sequence functions to direct a protein into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Movement into the lumen of the ER represents the initial step into the secretory pathway of the host cell. Thus, the addition of a signal peptide sequence to a non-secretory protein could promote secretion of that protein. A number of industrial enzymes (e.g., proteases, amylases, glucoamylases, cellulases, xylanase and phytases) which are produced either endogenously or exogenously in a host cell are secreted into the medium. Methods for expression of heterologous proteins and their secretion in a biologically active mature form using host cells such as yeast, filamentous fungi and bacteria as the expression system are needed. US 2006/0154342 discloses the amino acid and nucleic acid sequence of the NSP24 and NSP 25 proteases isolated from Trichoderma.WO 90/15860 discloses the use of different signal peptides for heterologous protein production and secretion.

Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, and from the claims. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention, the preferred methods and materials are described. Unless defined otherwise herein, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Singleton, et al., DICTIONARY OF MICROBIOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, 2D ED., John Wiley and Sons, New York (1994), and Hale & Markham, THE HARPER COLLINS DICTIONARY OF BIOLOGY, Harper Perennial, NY (1991) provide one of skill with general dictionaries of many of the terms used in this invention. The headings provided herein are not limitations of the various aspects or embodiments of the invention which can be had by reference to the specification as a whole. Accordingly, the terms defined immediately below are more fully defined by reference to the specification as a whole. Numeric ranges are inclusive of the numbers defining the range. Unless otherwise indicated, nucleic acids are written left to right in 5' to 3' orientation; amino acid sequences are written left to right in amino to carboxy orientation, respectively. It should be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural references unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to a composition containing "a compound" includes a mixture of two or more compounds. It should also be noted that the term "or" is generally employed in its sense including "and/or" unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Definitions A "signal sequence" or "signal peptide" means a sequence of amino acids bound to the N-terminal portion of a protein which facilitates the secretion of the mature form of the protein outside the cells. The definition of a signal sequence is a functional one. The mature form of the extracellular protein lacks the signal sequence which is cleaved off during the secretion process. An "NSP24 signal peptide" refers to an N-terminally extended sequence which has the sequence of SEQ ID NO:4 or a variant which functions as a signal sequence. An "NSP24 signal peptide" may be interchangeably referred to as an "NSP24 peptide" and "NSP aspartic protease signal peptide". As used herein, "NSP24 family protease" means an enzyme having protease activity in its native or wild type form and belonging to the family of NSP24 proteases. As used herein, a "native sequence NSP24" or "wildtype NSP24 sequence "includes a polypeptide having the same amino acid sequence as an NSP24 family protease derived from nature. As used herein, "operably linked" means that a regulatory region, such as a promoter, terminator, secretion signal or enhancer region is attached to or linked to a structural gene and controls the expression of that gene. A signal sequence is operably linked to a protein if it directs the protein through the secretion system of a host cell. The terms "isolated" or "purified" refers to a protein that is altered from its natural state by virtue of separating the protein from one or more or all of the naturally occurring constituents with which it is associated in nature. The terms "peptides", "proteins", and "polypeptides" are used interchangeably herein. As used herein, "percent (%) sequence identity" with respect to the amino acid or nucleotides sequences identified is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues or nucleotides in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues or nucleotides in a sequence of interest (e.g. a NSP24 signal peptide sequence), after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. "Homologous", as used herein, refers to the sequence similarity between two polypeptide molecules or between two nucleic acid molecules. When a position in both of the two compared sequences is occupied by the same base or amino acid monomer subunit, e.g., if a position in each of two DNA molecules is occupied by adenine, then the molecules are homologous at that position. The percent of homology between two sequences is a function of the number of matching or homologous positions shared by the two sequences divided by the number of positions compared x 100. For example, if 6 of 10, of the positions in two sequences are matched or homologous then the two sequences are 60% homologous. By way of example, the DNA sequences ATTGCC and TATGGC share 50% homology. Generally, a comparison is made when two sequences are aligned to give maximum homology. As used herein the term "vector" refers to a polynucleotide sequence designed to introduce nucleic acids into one or more cell types. Vectors include cloning vectors, expression vectors, shuttle vectors, plasmids, phage particles, cassettes and the like. As used herein, "expression vector" means a DNA construct including a DNA sequence which is operably linked to a suitable control sequence capable of affecting the expression of the DNA in a suitable host. The term "expression" means the process by which a polypeptide is produced based on the nucleic acid sequence of a gene. As used herein, a substance (e.g. a polynucleotide or protein) "derived from" a microorganism means "isolated from" and means that the substance is native to the microorganism. As used herein, "microorganism" refers to a bacterium, a fungus, a virus, a protozoan, and other microbes or microscopic organisms. As used herein, "host strain" or "host cell" means a suitable host for an expression vector including DNA according to the present invention and includes progeny of said cells. The term "filamentous fungi" refers to all filamentous forms of the subdivision Eumycotina (See, Alexopoulos, C. J. (1962), INTRODUCTORY MYCOLOGY, Wiley, New York and AINSWORTH AND BISBY DICTIONARY OF THE FUNGI, 9th Ed. (2001) Kirk et al., Eds., CAB International University Press, Cambridge UK). These fungi are characterized by a vegetative mycelium with a cell wall composed of chitin, cellulose, and other complex polysaccharides. The filamentous fungi of the present invention are morphologically, physiologically, and genetically distinct from yeasts. Vegetative growth by filamentous fungi is by hyphal elongation and carbon catabolism is obligatory aerobic. As used herein, the term "Trichoderma" or "Trichoderma sp." refer to any fungal genus previously or currently classified as Trichoderma. As used herein the term "culturing" refers to growing a population of microbial cells under suitable conditions in a liquid or solid medium. As used herein the term "contacting" refers to the placing of nucleic acids in sufficiently close proximity to the respective host to enable the nucleic acids to be taken up. The term "introduced" in the context of inserting a nucleic acid sequence into a cell, means "transfection", or "transformation" or "transduction" and includes reference to the incorporation of a nucleic acid sequence into a eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell wherein the nucleic acid sequence may be incorporated into the genome of the cell (e.g., chromosome, plasmid, plastid, or mitochondrial DNA), converted into an autonomous replicon, or transiently expressed (e.g., transfected mRNA). As used herein, the terms "transformed", "stably transformed" and "transgenic" used in reference to a cell means the cell has a non-native (e.g., heterologous) nucleic acid sequence integrated into its genome or as an episomal plasmid that is maintained through multiple generations. By "stably integrated" means that the episomal plasmic is maintained through multiple generations. As used herein the term "heterologous" with reference to a polypeptide or polynucleotide means a polypeptide or polynucleotide that is not naturally secreted using the NSP24 signal sequence. In some cases the heterologous protein is a polypeptide or polynucleotide that does not naturally occur in a host cell. In some embodiments, the polypeptide is a commercially important industrial protein or a protein of interest. It is intended that the term encompass proteins that are encoded by naturally occurring genes, mutated genes and/or synthetic genes. In some embodiments, the heterologous protein can be an endogenous protein (naturally occurs in the host cell), but is expressed in a non-natural way. Meaning that the protein is expressed from a non-natural promoter and/or signal sequence. Thus, a signal sequence is operably linked to a coding sequence that it is not usually operably linked to in a wild-type host cell. The term "homologous" or "endogenous" with reference to a polynucleotide or protein refers to a polynucleotide or protein that occurs naturally in the host cell. As used herein a "protein of interest" is a heterologous protein. A protein of interest may also be an endogenous protein that is expressed heterologously. As used herein, a "fusion protein" or "fusion polypeptide" comprises an NSP24 signal peptide operatively linked to a polypeptide/protein of interest. As used herein, the term "expression" refers to the process by which a polypeptide is produced based on the nucleic acid sequence of a gene. The process includes both transcription and translation. As described herein, one aspect of the invention features a "substantially pure" (or recombinant) nucleic acid that includes a nucleotide sequence encoding an NSP24 signal peptide operably linked to a heterologous protein, and/or equivalents of such nucleic acids. The term "equivalent" refers to nucleotide sequences encoding functionally equivalent polypeptides. Equivalent nucleotide sequences will include sequences that differ by one or more nucleotide substitutions, additions or deletions, such as allelic variants. For example in some embodiments, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code equivalent nucleotide sequences include sequences that differ from the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4. The term "selective marker" refers to a gene capable of expression in a host that allows for ease of selection of those hosts containing an introduced nucleic acid or vector. Examples of selectable markers include but are not limited to antimicrobials (e.g., hygromycin, bleomycin, or chloramphenicol) and/or genes that confer a metabolic advantage, such as a nutritional advantage on the host cell. Aspartic protease (NSP24) signal peptides and polynucleotides encoding the same - The invention is at least partially based on the identification that the aspartic protease (NSP24) signal peptide can be used for the expression and secretion of heterologous proteins. The NSP24 gene was isolated and sequenced from Trichoderma reesei (see US Patent Publication No: 2006-0154342, filed December 20, 2005). Sequencing identified a 407 amino acid open reading frame (SEQ ID NO:2) shown in Figure 1 b. A signal peptide was identified (shown in bold in figure 1 b) and comprises the first 20 amino acids MQTFGAFLVSFLAASGLAAA (SEQ ID NO:4) of SEQ ID NO:2. The DNA sequence of the NSP24 gene is provided in Figure 1a (SEQ ID NO:1). In Figure 1b, the signal peptide is in bold (SEQ ID NO:4), the prepro sequence is underlined and the mature NSP24 protein starts with KYG... and is represented by SEQ ID NO: 3. The invention relates to the use of NSP24 family protease signal peptides, having at least 95%, at least 97%, at least 98% and at least 99% sequence identity to the signal peptide of SEQ ID NO: 4 to express and secrete heterologous proteins in filamentous fungal cells. In some embodiments, the NSP24 signal peptide is designated NSP24 aspartic protease signal peptide. In some embodiments, the NSP24 signal peptides are biologically active fragments or variants which are able to act as signal peptides, for example to secrete proteins from a host cell. Thus, the NSP24 signal peptide having at least 95% sequence identity, 97%, 98%, and/or 99% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4 acts to increase secretion of a protein from a host cell. In some embodiments, the active variant is a truncated version of the NSP24 signal peptide having at least 19 amino acids, at least 18 amino acids, at least 17 amino acids, and/or at least 16 amino acids and still able to function as a signal peptide. Guidance in determining which amino acid residues may be replaced, added or deleted without abolishing activities of interest, may be found by comparing the sequence of the particular polypeptide with that of homologous peptides and minimizing the number of amino acid sequence changes made in regions of high homology (conserved regions) or by replacing amino acids with consensus sequences. Preferably, amino acid "substitutions" are the result of replacing one amino acid with another amino acid having similar structural and/or chemical properties, i.e., conservative amino acid replacements may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity, change, solubility, hydrophobicity, and/or the amphipathic nature of the residues involved. Examples of conservative substitutions are those between the following groups: Gly/Ala, Val/Ile/Leu, Lys/Arg, Asn/Gln, Glu/Asp, Ser/Cys/Thr, and Phe/Trp/Tyr. A variant may, for example, differ by as few as 1 to 10 amino acid residues, such as 6 -10, as few as 5, as few as 4, 3, 2, or even 1 amino acid residue. Table 1 illustrates exemplary amino acid substitutions that are recognized in the art. In addition, substitution may be by one or more non-conservative amino acid substitutions, deletions, or insertions that do not abolish the signal peptide activity.

By "degenerate variants" is intended nucleotide fragments that differ from a nucleic acids of the invention by nucleotide sequence but, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, encode an identical polypeptide sequence. The invention provides for fusion polypeptides. As used herein, a fusion protein or fusion polypeptide comprises an NSP24 signal peptide operatively linked to a heterologous polypeptide/protein of interest. Within the fusion protein, the term "operatively linked" is intended to indicate that the NSP24 signal polypeptide and the polypeptide of interest are fused in-frame to one another. The NSP24 signal peptides are fused to the N-terminal end of the heterologous protein. Polypeptides of interest include heterologous polypeptides. Polypeptides of interest include full-length polypeptides that are naturally synthesized with a signal peptide, the mature form of the full-length polypeptides, and polypeptides that lack a signal peptide. In some embodiments, the fusion polypeptide comprises an NSP24 signal peptide that is the secretory leader sequence of polypeptides that are naturally expressed by Trichoderma that is operably linked to a heterologous polypeptide or protein of interest. In some embodiments, the fusion polypeptide comprises an NSP24 signal peptide and a heterologous polypeptide such as an enzyme, a growth factor or a hormone. Enzymes include, but are not limited to: phytases, proteases, carbohydrases (such as amylases, cellulases, xylanases, and lipases), isomerases (such as racemases, epimerases, tautomerases, or mutases, transferases, glucoamylases, kinases, amidases, esterases, oxidases, and laccases. Thus, the protein of interest can be an enzyme such as an alpha amylase, an alkaline alpha amylase, a beta amylase, a cellulase, a beta glucosidase, a beta glucanase, a dextranase, an alpha glucosidase, a glucoamylase, a pullulanase, a pectinase, a protease, a xylanase, a hemicellulase, a pentosanase, an inveratase, a laccase, a lactase, a lipase, an esterase, a phytase, a phospholipase, a pregastric esterase, an iminoacylase, a glutaminase, a lysozyme, a glucose isomerase, an oxidase, a catalase, a glucose oxidase, a lyase, a fumerase, a transferase, mannosidases, a beta galactosidases, a mutanase, a ligase, and a peroxidase. The enzyme can be a wild-type enzyme or a variant of a wild-type enzyme. The enzyme can be a domain of an enzyme, such as a catalytic domain of an alpha amylase. The enzyme can be a hybrid enzyme, which comprises a least two fragments from different enzymes, for example, a catalytic domain of one enzyme and a starch binding domain of a different enzyme. Or the hybrid enzyme can be two fragments each comprising a part of the catalytic domain of the enzymes. In some embodiments, the fusion polypeptide of the invention comprises an NSP24 signal peptide as recited herein, and a heterologous protein. In other embodiments, the fusion polypeptide of the invention comprises an NSP24 signal peptide as recited herein, and an enzyme that is a protease, a carbohydrase, an isomerase, a glucoamylase, a kinase, an amidase, an esterase, or an oxidase. In some embodiments, the enzyme is naturally associated with a signal peptide. In other embodiments, the enzyme is not naturally associated with a signal peptide. In some embodiments, the NSP24 signal peptides of the invention are native sequences. Such a native sequence can be isolated from nature or can be produced by recombinant or synthetic means. The term "native sequence" specifically encompasses naturally-occurring truncated or secreted forms of an NSP24 signal peptide sequence (e.g., biologically active fragments), and naturally-occurring variant forms. A nucleic acid is hybridizable to another nucleic acid sequence when a single stranded form of the nucleic acid can anneal to the other nucleic acid under appropriate conditions of temperature and solution ionic strength. Hybridization and washing conditions are well known in the art for hybridization under low, medium, high and very high stringency conditions (See, e.g., Sambrook (1989) supra, particularly chapters 9 and 11). In general hybridization involves a nucleotide probe and a homologous DNA sequence that from stable double stranded hybrids by extensive base-pairing of complementary polynucleotides (Also see, Chapter 8, Gene Cloning, An Introduction, T.A. Brown (1995) Chapman and Hall London). In some embodiments the filter with the probe and homologous sequence may be washed in 2x sodium chloride/sodium citrate (SSC), 0.5% SDS at about 60°C (medium stringency), 65°C (medium/high stringency), 70°C (high stringency) and about 75°C (very high stringency) (Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1989, 6.3.1 - 6.3.6); Included in the invention are: allelic variations; natural mutants; induced mutants; proteins encoded by DNA that hybridizes under high or low stringency conditions to a nucleic acid which encodes a peptide of SEQ ID NO: 4. Nucleic acids and polypeptides of the invention include those that differ from the sequences disclosed herein by virtue of sequencing errors in the disclosed sequences. Homology of DNA sequences is determined by the degree of identity between two DNA sequences. Homology or percent identity may be determined for polypeptide sequences or nucleotides sequences using computer programs. Methods for performing sequence alignment and determining sequence identity are known to the skilled artisan, may be performed without undue experimentation, and calculations of identity values may be obtained with definiteness. See, for example, Ausubel et al., eds. (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chapter 19 (Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York); and the ALIGN program (Dayhoff (1978) in Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure 5:Suppl. 3 (National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D.C.). A number of algorithms are available for aligning sequences and determining sequence identity and include, for example, the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman et al. (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48:443; the local homology algorithm of Smith et al. (1981) Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482; the search for similarity method of Pearson et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 85:2444; the Smith-Waterman algorithm (Meth. Mol. Biol. 70:173-187 (1997); and BLASTP, BLASTN, and BLASTX algorithms (see Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410). Computerized programs using these algorithms are also available, and include, but are not limited to: ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software, or WU-BLAST-2 (Altschul et al., Meth. Enzym., 266:460-480 (1996)); or GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST Altschul et al., supra, FASTA, and TFASTA, available in the Genetics Computing Group (GCG) package, Version 8, Madison, Wis., USA; and CLUSTAL in the PC/Gene program by Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the length of the sequences being compared. Preferably, the sequence identity is determined using the default parameters determined by the program. Specifically, sequence identity can be determined by the Smith-Waterman homology search algorithm (Meth. Mol. Biol. 70:173-187 (1997)) as implemented in MSPRCH program (Oxford Molecular) using an affine gap search with the following search parameters: gap open penalty of 12, and gap extension penalty of 1. Preferably, paired amino acid comparisons can be carried out using the GAP program of the GCG sequence analysis software package of Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, Wis., employing the blosum62 amino acid substitution matrix, with a gap weight of 12 and a length weight of 2. With respect to optimal alignment of two amino acid sequences, the contiguous segment of the variant amino acid sequence may have additional amino acid residues or deleted amino acid residues with respect to the reference amino acid sequence. The contiguous segment used for comparison to the reference amino acid sequence will include at least 20 contiguous amino acid residues, and may be 30, 40, 50, or more amino acid residues. Corrections for increased sequence identity associated with inclusion of gaps in the variants amino acid sequence can be made by assigning gap penalties. In some embodiments, the NSP24 signal peptides encompassed by the invention (e.g. an NSP24 signal peptide having at least 95% sequence identity to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4), is derived from a bacterium or a fungus, such as a filamentous fungus. Some preferred filamentous fungi include Aspergillus spp. and Trichoderma spp. One preferred Trichoderma spp. is T. reesei. However, the signal peptide and/or DNA encoding the signal peptide according to the instant invention may be derived from a fungus, such as, Absidia spp.; Acremonium spp.; Agaricus spp.; Anaeromyces spp.; Aspergillus spp., including A. aculeatus, A. awamori, A. flavus, A. foetidus, A. fumaricus, A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, A. niger, A. oryzae, A. terreus and A. versicolor, Aeurobasidium spp.; Cephalosporum spp.; Chaetomium spp.; Coprinus spp.; Dactyllum spp.; Fusarium spp., including F. conglomerans, F. decemcellulare, F. javanicum, F. lini, F. oxysporum and F. solani; Gliocladium spp.; Humicola spp., including H. insolens and H. lanuginosa; Mucor spp.; Neurospora spp., including N. crassa and N. sitophila; Neocallimastix spp.; Orpinomyces spp.; Penicillium spp; Phanerochaete spp.; Phlebia spp.; Piromyces spp.; Rhizopus spp.; Schizophyllum spp.; Trametes spp.; Trichoderma spp., including T. reesei, T. reesei (longibrachiatum) and T. viride; and Zygorhynchus spp. Host cells - In some embodiments, this invention provides for host cells transformed with DNA constructs and vector as described herein. In some embodiments, the invention provides for host cells transformed with DNA constructs encoding a heterologous protein encompassed by the invention and operably linked to the NSP24 signal peptide encompassed by the invention. In some embodiments, the invention provides DNA constructs introduced into a host cell that code for a heterologous phytase, protease, alpha amylase, glucoamylase, xylanase, cellulose, and or any protein of interest. In some embodiments the invention provides for the expression of heterologous protein genes under control of gene promoters functional in host cells such as bacterial and fungal host cells. The type of host cell used in the invention is not critical, but is preferably a cell in which the NSP24 signal peptide has activity in secreting the heterologous protein of interest. The type of host cells for which a T. reesei signal peptide is expected to have activity, includes but is not limited to fungal and bacterial cells. Some preferred host cells include filamentous fungal cells. Non-limiting examples of filamentous fungal host cells include Trichoderma spp. (e.g. T. viride and T. reesei, the asexual morph of Hypocrea jecorina, previously classified as T. longibrachiatum), Penicillium spp., Humicola spp. (e.g. H. insolens and H. grisea), Aspergillus spp. (e.g., A. niger, A. nidulans, A. orzyae, and A. awamori), Fusarium spp. (F. graminum), Neurospora spp., Hypocrea spp. and Mucor spp. Further host cells may include Bacillus spp (e.g. B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. lentus, B. stearothremophilus and B. brevis) and Streptomyces spp. (e.g., S coelicolor and S. lividans (TK23 and TK21)). However, many methods are known for identifying whether a heterologous protein is secreted in a host cell or remains in the cytoplasm. These methods can be used to identify host cells in which the signal sequence is active. Molecular Biology - This invention relies on routine techniques in the field of recombinant genetics. Basic texts disclosing the general methods of use in this invention include Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (2nd ed. 1989); Kriegler, Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual (1990); and Ausubel et al., eds., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (1994)). Heterologous genes comprising gene promoter sequences, for example, of filamentous fungi are typically cloned into intermediate vectors before transformation into host cells, such as Trichoderma reesei cells for replication and/or expression. These intermediate vectors are typically prokaryotic vectors, e.g., plasmids, or shuttle vectors. To obtain high level expression of a cloned gene, the heterologous gene is preferably positioned about the same distance from the promoter as in the naturally occurring gene. As is known in the art, however, some variation in this distance can be accommodated without loss of promoter function. Those skilled in the art are aware that a natural promoter can be modified by replacement, substitution, addition or elimination of one or more nucleotides without changing its function. The practice of the invention encompasses and is not constrained by such alterations to the promoter. The expression vector/construct typically contains a transcription unit or expression cassette that contains all the additional elements required for the expression of the heterologous sequence. A typical expression cassette thus contains a promoter operably linked to the heterologous nucleic acid sequence and signals required for efficient polyadenylation of the transcript, ribosome binding sites, and translation termination. Additional elements of the cassette may include enhancers and, if genomic DNA is used as the structural gene, introns with functional splice donor and acceptor sites, secretion leader peptides, leader sequences, linkers, and cleavage sites. The practice of the invention is not constrained by the choice of promoter in the genetic construct. However, exemplary promoters are the Trichoderma reesei cbh1, cbh2, eg1, eg2, eg3, eg5, xln1 and xln2 promoters. Also promoters from A. awamori and A. niger glucoamylase genes (glaA) (Nunberg et al., (1984) Mol. Cell Biol. 4:2306 - 2315) and the promoter from A. nidulans acetamidase find use in the vectors. A preferred promoter for vectors used in Bacillus subtilis is the AprE promoter; a preferred promoter used in E. coli is the Lac promoter, a preferred promoter used in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is PGK1, a preferred promoter used in Aspergillus niger is glaA, and a preferred promoter for Trichoderma reesei is cbhl. In addition to a promoter sequence, the expression cassette can also contain a transcription termination region downstream of the structural gene to provide for efficient termination. The termination region may be obtained from the same gene as the promoter sequence or may be obtained from different genes. Although any fungal terminator is likely to be functional in the present invention, some preferred terminators include: the terminator from Aspergillus nidulans trpC gene (Yelton, M. et al. (1984) PNAS USA 81:1470-1474, Mullaney, E.J. et al. (1985) MGG 199:37-45), the Aspergillus awamori or Aspergillus niger glucoamylase genes (Nunberg, J.H. et al. (1984) Mol. Cell Biol. 4:2306, Boel, E. et al.(1984) EMBO J. 3:1581-1585), the Aspergillus oryzae TAKA amylase gene, and the Mucor miehei carboxyl protease gene (EPO Publication No. 0 215 594). The particular expression vector used to transport the genetic information into the cell is not particularly critical. Any of the conventional vectors used for expression in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells may be used. Examples of suitable expression and/or integration vectors are provided in Sambrook et al., (1989) supra,Bennett and Lasure (Eds.) More Gene Manipulations in Fungi, (1991) Academic Press pp. 70 - 76 and pp. 396 - 428 and articles cited therein; USP 5,874,276 and Fungal Genetic Stock Center Catalogue of Strains, (FGSC, www.fgsc.net.). However, the invention is intended to include other forms of expression vectors which serve equivalent functions and which are, or become, known in the art. Thus, a wide variety of host/expression vector combinations may be employed in expressing the DNA sequences of this invention. In some embodiments, an expression vector includes a selectable marker. Examples of selectable markers include ones which confer antimicrobial resistance. Nutritional markers also find use in the present invention including those markers known in the art as amdS, argB and pyr4. Markers useful for the transformation of Trichoderma are known in the art (see, e.g., Finkelstein, chapter 6, in Biotechnology of Filamentous Fungi, Finkelstein et al., EDS Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston MA (1992) and Kinghorn et al., (1992) Applied Molecular Genetics of Filamentous Fungi, Blackie Academic and Professional, Chapman and Hall, London). In some embodiments, the expression vectors will also include a replicon, a gene encoding antibiotic resistance to permit selection of bacteria that harbor recombinant plasmids, and unique restriction sites in nonessential regions of the plasmid to allow insertion of heterologous sequences. The particular antibiotic resistance gene chosen is not critical, any of the many resistance genes known in the art are suitable. The prokaryotic sequences are preferably chosen such that they do not interfere with the replication or integration of the DNA in Trichoderma reesei. In some embodiments, an expression vector includes a reporter gene alone or, optionally as a fusion with the protein of interest. Examples of reporter genes includes but is not limited to, fluorescent reporters, color detectable reporters (□ galactosidase), and biotinylated reporters. For example, the reporter molecule when expressed can be used to identify whether the signal peptide is active in a host cell. If the signal peptide is active, the reporter molecule will be secreted from the cell. The signal peptide can be operably linked to the reporter initially to identify secretion from a particular host cell. Alternative methods such as those using antibodies specific to the protein of interest and/or the signal peptide can be used to identify whether the protein of interest is secreted. In one embodiment, the vector pTrex3g (Fig. 2) is used for transformation by a method according to the invention. This vector is based on the E. coli vector pSL1180 (Pharmacia Inc., Piscataway, NJ) which is a pUC118 phagemid based vector (Brosius, J. (1989), DNA 8:759) with an extended multiple cloning site containing 64 hexamer restriction enzyme recognition sequences. The vector is designed as a Gateway destination vector (Hartley et al., (2000) Genome Research 10:1788 -1795) to allow insertion using Gateway technology (Invitrogen) of any desired open reading frame between the promoter and terminator regions of the T. reesei cbh1 gene. It also contains the Aspergillus nidulans amdS gene for use as a selective marker in the electroporation transformation method of the invention. However, as mentioned above the fusion protein encompassed by the invention is not limited by the type of vector. The methods of transformation of the present invention may result in the stable integration of all or part of the transformation vector into the genome of a host cell, such as a filamentous fungal host cell. However, transformation resulting in the maintenance of a self-replicating extra-chromosomal transformation vector is also contemplated. Many standard transfection methods can be used to produce bacterial and filamentous fungal (e.g. Aspergillus or Trichoderma) cell lines that express large quantities of the heterologous proteins. Some of the published methods for the introduction of DNA constructs into Trichoderma include Lorito, Hayes, DiPietro and Harman, (1993) Curr. Genet. 24: 349-356; Goldman, VanMontagu and Herrera-Estrella, (1990) Curr. Genet. 17:169-174; and Penttila, Nevalainen, Ratto, Salminen and Knowles, (1987) Gene 6: 155-164, also see USP 6.022,725; USP 6,268,328 and Nevalainen et al., "The Molecular Biology of Trichoderma and its Application to the Expression of Both Homologous and Heterologous Genes" in Molecular Industrial Mycology, Eds, Leong and Berka, Marcel Dekker Inc., NY (1992) pp 129 - 148; for Aspergillus include Yelton, Hamer and Timberlake, (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81: 1470-1474, for Fusarium include Bajar, Podila and Kolattukudy, (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 8202-8212, for Streptomyces include Hopwood et al., 1985, Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: Laboratory Manual, The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, UK and Fernandez-Abalos et al., Microbiol 149:1623 - 1632 (2003) and for Bacillus include Brigidi, DeRossi, Bertarini, Riccardi and Matteuzzi, (1990) FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 55: 135-138). However, any of the well-known procedures for introducing foreign nucleotide sequences into host cells may be used. These include the use of calcium phosphate transfection, polybrene, protoplast fusion, electroporation, lithium acetate, biolistics, liposomes, microinjection, plasma vectors, viral vectors and any of the other well known methods for introducing cloned genomic DNA, cDNA, synthetic DNA or other foreign genetic material into a host cell (see, e.g., Sambrook et al., supra). Also of use is the Agrobacterium-mediated transfection method described in U.S. Patent No. 6,255,115. It is only necessary that the particular genetic engineering procedure used be capable of successfully introducing at least one gene into the host cell capable of expressing the gene. In one embodiment, the invention concerns a method for producing a heterologous protein encompassed by the invention which comprises introducing into a host cell a polynucleotide comprising an NSP24 signal peptide linked to a nucleic acid encoding a heterologous protein, culturing the host cell under suitable culture conditions for the expression and production of the heterologous protein, and producing said heterologous protein. In some preferred embodiments, the heterologous protein is secreted from the host cell. After the expression vector is introduced into the cells, the transfected or transformed cells are cultured under conditions favoring expression of genes under control of the gene promoter sequences. Large batches of transformed cells can be cultured. Finally, product is recovered from the culture using standard techniques. Thus, the invention herein provides for the expression and secretion of heterologous polypeptides (protein of interest) by operably linking the NSP24 signal peptide sequence to a heterologous protein and/or protein of interest. Aspects of the invention provide processes for expressing and secreting high levels of such desired polypeptides. Heterologous proteins The term "heterologous protein" means any protein that is not naturally operably linked to the NSP24 signal sequence. The heterologous protein can be a protein that does not naturally occur in a host cell. Alternatively the heterologous protein can be an endogenous protein that is heterologously expressed. The heterologous protein can be any protein other than the NSP24 protein from which the signal peptide is obtained. The type of heterologous protein is not critical to the invention, but can be any protein of interest. Some non-limiting examples of heterologous proteins useful in compositions and applications according to the invention include for example phytases, glucoamylases, alpha amylases, granular starch hydrolyzing enzymes, cellulases, lipases, xylanases, cutinases, hemicellulases, proteases, oxidases, laccases and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the phytase is BP-wild type, a variant thereof (such as BP-11) disclosed in WO 06/043178 or a variant as disclosed in US patent application 11/714,487, filed March 6, 2007. For example, a BP-wild type and variants thereof are disclosed in Table 1 of WO 06/043178, wherein the numbering is in reference to SEQ ID NO:3 of the published PCT application. In one preferred embodiment, a phytase useful in the instant invention is one having at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 88%, at least 90%, at least 93%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98% and at least 99% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:5 shown in Figure 4b and variants thereof. More preferably, the phytase will have at least 95% to 99% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:5 or variants thereof. In some embodiments, the phytase comprises or consists of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:5. Heterologous protein Expression Heterologous proteins of the present invention are produced by culturing cells transformed with a vector such as an expression vector containing genes secreted by fusion with the NSP24 signal peptide sequence. The present invention is particularly useful for the intracellular and/or extracellular production of heterologous proteins encompassed by the invention. Optimal conditions for the production of the proteins will vary with the choice of the host cell, and with the choice of heterologous protein to be expressed. Such conditions will be easily ascertained by one skilled in the art through routine experimentation or optimization. The heterologous protein of interest may be isolated or recovered and purified after expression. The protein of interest may be isolated or purified in a variety of ways known to those skilled in the art depending on what other components are present in the sample. Standard purification methods include electrophoretic, molecular, immunological and chromatographic techniques, including ion exchange, hydrophobic, affinity, and reverse-phase HPLC chromatography, and chromatofocusing. For example, the protein of interest may be purified using a standard anti-protein of interest antibody column. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration techniques, in conjunction with protein concentration, are also useful. For general guidance in suitable purification techniques, see Scopes, Protein Purification (1982). The degree of purification necessary will vary depending on the use of the protein of interest. In some instances no purification will be necessary. Cell culture Host cells and transformed cells can be cultured in conventional nutrient media. The culture media for transformed host cells may be modified as appropriate for activating promoters and selecting transformants. The specific culture conditions, such as temperature, pH and the like, may be those that are used for the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to those skilled in the art. In addition, preferred culture conditions may be found in the scientific literature such as Sambrook, (1982) supra; Kieser, T, MJ. Bibb, MJ. Buttner, KF Chater, and D.A. Hopwood (2000) PRACTICAL STREPTOMYCES GENETICS. John Innes Foundation, Norwich UK; Harwood, et al., (1990) MOLECULAR BIOLOGICAL METHODS FOR BACILLUS, John Wiley and/or from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; www.atcc.org). Stable transformants of fungal host cells, such as Trichoderma cells can generally be distinguished from unstable transformants by their faster growth rate or the formation of circular colonies with a smooth rather than ragged outline on solid culture medium. Recovery of Expressed Polypeptides and Methods for Purifying the heterologous proteins - A heterologous protein of interest encompassed by the invention, produced by the transformed host cell may be recovered from the culture medium by conventional procedures including separating the host cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, or if necessary, disrupting the cells and removing the supernatant from the cellular fraction and debris. In some cases, after clarification, the proteinaceous components of the supernatant or filtrate are precipitated by means of a salt, e.g., ammonium sulphate. The precipitated proteins are then solubilized and may be purified by a variety of chromatographic procedures, e.g., ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, affinity chromatography, and other art-recognized procedures. Antibodies to the peptides and proteins can be made by immunizing an animal, e.g., a rabbit or mouse, and recovering anti-heterologous protein and/or NSP24 signal peptide antibodies by prior art methods. Assays that find use in the present invention include, but are not limited to those described in WO 9934011 and USP 6,605,458. Compositions - In some embodiments, the present invention is directed to expression of heterologous proteins using the NSP24 signal sequence, constructs and vectors as described herein. Compositions comprising the heterologous protein of interest can be used in a variety of applications. Compositions may further include additional enzymes, such as, but not limited ot, glucoamylases, alpha amylases, granular starch hydrolyzing enzymes, cellulases, lipase, xylanases, cutinases, hemicellulases, oxidases, laccases and combinations thereof. Applications The heterologous proteins produced by the present invention can be used in any applications appropriate for that protein. Examples of applications for heterologous proteins such as enzymes includes, but is not limited to the following: Animal feeds for improvement of feed intake and feed efficiency (proteases), dietary protein hydrolysates for those with impaired digestive system, leather treatment, treatment of protein fibers, such as wool and silk, cleaning, protein processing (for example to remove bitter peptides, to enhance the flavor of food, to produce cheese and cocoa), personal care products (such as hair compositions), sweeteners (production of high maltose or high fructose syrups for example), and fermentation and bioethanol (alpha amylases and glucoamylases can be used to treat grains for fermentation). EXAMPLES The present invention is described in further detail in the following examples which are not in any way intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed. The attached Figures are meant to be considered as integral parts of the specification and description of the invention. The following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to limit the claimed invention. Experimental The invention is further defined by reference to the following examples, which describe in detail, preparation of compounds of the invention and methods for assaying for biological activity. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that many modifications, both to materials and methods, may be practiced without departing from the scope of the invention.

Examples Example 1: Electroporation Efficiency of Trichoderma reesei Spores as a Function of Electroporation Voltage A T. reesei strain derived from G1CC2984 (pyr+) was grown and sporulated on Potato Dextrose Agar plates (Difco) for about 10-20 days. The spores were washed from the surface of the plates with water and purified by filtration through Miracloth (Calbiochem). The spores were collected by centrifugation (3000 x G, 12 min), washed once with ice-cold water and once with ice-cold 1.1 M sorbitol. The spore pellet was re-suspended in a small volume of cold 1.1 M sorbitol, mixed with about 8 µg of XbaI hydrolysate of pTrex3 (Figure 2) per 100 µl of spore suspension. The mixture (100 µl) was placed into an electroporation cuvette (1mm gap) and subjected to an electric pulse using the following electroporation parameters: voltage 6000-20000 V/cm, capacitance = 25 µF, resistance = 50Ω. After electroporation, the spores were diluted about 100-fold into 5:1 mixture of 1.1 M sorbitol and YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose, pH 5.5), placed in shake flasks and incubated for 16-18 hours in an orbital shaker (28°C and 200 rpm). The spores were once again collected by centrifugation, re-suspended in about 10-fold of pellet volume of 1.1 M sorbitol and plated onto two 15 cm Petri plates containing amdS modified medium (acetamide 0.6 g/l, cesium chloride 1.68 g/l, glucose 20 g/l, potassium dihydrogen phosphate 15 g/l, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 0.6 g/l, calcium chloride dihydrate 0.6 g/l, iron (II) sulfate 5mg/l, zinc sulfate 1.4 mg/l, cobalt (II) chloride 1mug/), manganese (II) sulfate 1.6 mg/l, agar 20 g/l and pH 4.25). Transformants appeared until about 1 week of incubation. Counting of colonies at this stage was difficult because of overgrowths of early transformants. Therefore, numerical estimates were made by counting transformants after 4 days of incubation. As can be seen from the data presented on Figure 3 optimal voltage for transformation of T. reesei spores is about 18000 V/cm. However, at this high voltage "arcing" in the electroporation cuvette is often a problem. The use of 16 000V/cm significantly reduced arcing while retaining acceptable transformation efficiency. No transformants were obtained using the voltage range of 6000-8000V/cm. Example 2: Transformation of a recombinant Trichoderma reesei strain with a Phytase Expression Cassette In this example, a recombinant T. reesei strain GICC2984 was used for transformation. The recombinant strain expresses a mutant form of T. reesei xylanase designated Y5. This xylanase is a thermostable mutant form of a T. reesei xylanase (Fenel et al., International Publication No. WO 0127252). The expression vector used to transform the recombinant T. reesei strain included the coding sequence for a polypeptide having phytase activity (see Figure 4). The phytase is designated BP17. BP17 is a mutant thermostable phytase derived from a wild-type phytase from Buttiauxella sp (Miasnikov et al., International Publication No. WO 2006/043178). The amino acid sequence of the mature protein of BP-17 is shown in Figure 4b: The BP-17 coding sequence (SEQ ID NO:5) was fused to an NSP24 aspartic protease signal peptide (SEQ ID NO:4) and placed under the control of T. reesei cbhI promoter and transcription terminator in expression vector pTrex3g. The structure of this vector is illustrated in Figure 4. A 5.85 kb XbaI-XbaI fragment of pTrex3g comprising the expression cassette and a selectable marker (amdS gene from Aspergillus nidulans) was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and used to transform the recombinant T. reesei Y5 strain GICC 2984 by the procedure described in Example 1 using 16 kV/cm voltage. Transformant colonies appeared in a period between 4 days to about 1 week after plating. Individual transformants were transferred onto fresh acetamide selective plates and grown for 3-4 days. Most isolates showed stable growth on selective medium. The clones (38) were used to inoculate 5 ml of lactose defined medium (Foreman et al., International Publication No. WO 2005/001036) in 20x175 mm test tubes. The tubes were fixed in a rotary shaker at about 45° angle and shaken at 200 rpm and 28° C for 4-5 days. Example 3: Analysis of Phytase Gene Expression in T. reesei Transformants The culture medium of the transformants obtained and cultivated as described in Example 2 was separated from mycelium by centrifugation (16000 x G, 10 min) and analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS PAGE). The results of a typical experiment are that about 2/3 of all studied transformants (24 out of 38) expressed the phytase gene at levels easily detectable by SDS PAGE. The expression levels of phytase varied largely between clones. To obtain a more quantitative estimate of the variability of phytase/xylanase ratios in different clones, enzymatic activities were determined in a set of transformants chosen to represent the whole spectrum of phytase expression levels. Phytase assays were carried out using as a substrate 7.5 mM phytase in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, containing 1mg/ml BSA at a final pH 5.0. The culture supernatants (20 µl, diluted 1:80 and 1:160), were mixed with 100 □l of the substrate solution and incubated for 90 min at 25°C. The reaction was quenched by addition of 100 µl of a freshly made solution containing 1 part of 10% ammonium molybdate, 1 part of 0.24% ammonium vanadate and 2 parts of 20% nitric acid. After centrifugation (16000xG for 10 min), 200 µl of supernatant from each reaction was transferred into a well of a microtitre plate and the absorbance at 405 nm was recorded. The difference in absorbance between the experimental and control samples (containing water instead of the enzyme solution) was taken as the measure of enzymatic activity. Xylanase was assayed as follows. Ten tablets from a Xylazyme AX assay kit (Megazyme) were dispersed in 15 ml of 100 mM NaOAc buffer containing 1 mg/ml BSA to make the substrate suspension. The pH was adjusted to 5.0 and 10 µl of the culture supernatants diluted to an appropriate concentration so that the assay was in the linear range (1:80 and 1:160). They were reacted with 250 µl of the substrate suspension for 90 min at 25°C. The reaction was quenched by addition of 250 µl of 1 M Na2CO3. After centrifugation of the reaction mixtures (16000xG for 10 min), 100 µl of the supernatant from each reaction was transferred into a well of a microtitre plate and the absorbance at 595nm was measured. The difference in absorbance between the experimental and control samples (containing water instead of the enzyme solution) was taken as the measure of enzymatic activity. The results of the determination of phytase and xylanase activity in 8 different clones are summarized in Table 2. This data, in accordance with the results of electrophoretic analysis indicates that the ratios of the two enzymatic activities in different transformants vary over a broad range.

The plasmid was constructed similarly to that shown in Figure 6a (pTrex4-laccaseD opt) except that the laccase D constructs were operably linked to the NSP24 signal peptide, which was inserted in place of the laccase D opt linked to the CBH1 signal sequence, catalytic domain and linker. Figures. 7a and b provide the schematic and the polynucleotide sequence of the Trichoderma expression plasmid pKB408 (SEQ ID NO:7), respectively. The pKB410 plasmid was produced similarly, except the T. reesei CHB1 signal sequence was used instead of the NSP24 signal sequence. Figures 8a and b provide the schematic and the polynucleotide sequence of the Trichoderma expression plasmid pKB410 (SEQ ID NO:8), respectively. pTrex4-laccaseD contained the laccase D codon optimized gene fused to the CBH1 (cellobiohydrolase) core/linker and expressed from the CBH1 promoter. Figure 6a provides a schematic of the Trichoderma expression plasmid and Figure 6b provides the sequence of the pTrex4-laccaseD opt plasmid (SEQ ID NO:6). The following segments of DNA were assembled in the construction of pTrex4-laccase D opt (See,Figure 6a). A fragment of T. reesei genomic DNA representing the CBH1 promoter and the CBH1 signal sequence and CBH1 core/linker was inserted into the plasmid pSL1180 vector. A codon optimized copy of the C. unicolor laccase D (laccase D opt) gene was inserted, such that it was operably linked to the CBH1 at its linker region. A CBH1 terminator from T. reesei was operably linked to the laccase D gene. The amdS gene was added as a selectable autotropic marker. The bla gene (encoding beta-lactamase, a selective marker obtained from E.coli) is present in the pSL1180 vector. The sequence of the plasmid is provided as Figure 6b (SEQ ID NO:6). EXAMPLE 5: Transformation of T. reesei and Analysis of Expression In this example, the stable recombinant T. reesei strain derived from RL-P37 (See, Sheir-Neiss and Montenecourt, Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol., 20:46-53 [1984]) and deleted for the cbh1, cbh2, egl1, and egl2 genes described by Bower et al (See, Bower et al., Carbohydrases From Trichoderma reesei and Other Micro-organisms. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, pp. 327-334 [1998]) was used for transforming the plasmids from Example 4. Biolistic and electroporation methods were used to transform the plasmids, as described below. Biolistic Transformation: The expression plasmid was confirmed by DNA sequencing and transformed biolistically into a Trichoderma strain. Transformation of the Trichoderma strain by the biolistic transformation method was accomplished using a Biolistic® PDS-1000/he Particle Delivery System (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions (See, WO 05/001036 and US Pat. Appl. Publ. No. 2006/0003408). Tranformants were selected and transferred onto minimal media with acetamide (MMA) plates and grown for 4 days at 30°C. A small plug of a single colony including spores and mycelium was transferred into 30 mls of NREL lactose defined broth (pH 6.2) containing 1 mM copper. The cultures were grown for 5 days at 30°C. Culture broths were centrifuged and supernatants were analyzed using the ABTS assay as described below for laccase activity. Electroporation Electroporation was performed as described in Method for Introducing Nucleic acids into Fungal Cells, US Patent Publication No: 2010-0304468 (US60/931072). A T. reesei strain was grown and sporulated on Potato Dextrose Agar plates (Difco) for about 10-20 days. The spores were washed from the surface of the plates with water and purified by filtration through Miracloth (Calbiochem). The spores were collected by centrifugation (3000 xg, 12 min), washed once with ice-cold water and once with ice-cold 1.1 M sorbitol. The spore pellet was re-suspended in a small volume of cold 1.1 M sorbitol, mixed with about 8 □g of gel-purified DNA fragment isolated from plasmid DNA (pKB408 and pKB410, Figures 6a and 7a) per 100 µl of spore suspension. The mixture (100 µl) was placed into an electroporation cuvette (1 mm gap) and subjected to an electric pulse using the following electroporation parameters: voltage 6000-20000 V/cm, capacitance = 25 µF, resistance = 50Ω̃ After electroporation, the spores were diluted about 100-fold into 5:1 mixture of 1.1 M sorbitol and YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose, pH 5.5), placed in shake flasks and incubated for 16-18 hours in an orbital shaker (28°C and 200 rpm). The spores were once again collected by centrifugation, re-suspended in about 10-fold of pellet volume of 1.1 M sorbitol and plated onto two 15 cm Petri plates containing amdS modified medium (acetamide 0.6 g/l, cesium chloride 1.68 g/l, glucose 20 g/l, potassium dihydrogen phosphate 15 g/l, magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 0.6 g/l, calcium chloride dihydrate 0.6 g/l, iron (II) sulfate 5mg/l, zinc sulfate 1.4 mg/l, cobalt (II) chloride 1mg/l, manganese (II) sulfate 1.6 mg/l, agar 20 g/l and pH 4.25). Transformants appeared at about 1 week of incubation at 28-30°C. The ABTS assay was performed as follows: An ABTS stock solution was prepared containing 4.5 mM ABTS in water (ABTS; Sigma Cat# A-1888). Buffer was prepared containing 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 5.0. Then, 1.5 ml of buffer and 0.2 ml of ABTS stock solution were added to cuvettes (10x4x45mm, No./REF67.742) and mixed well. One extra cuvette was prepared as a blank. Then, 50 ul of each enzyme sample to be tested (using various dilutions) were added to the mixtures. The ABTS activity was measured in a Genesys2 machine (Spectronic) using an ABTS kinetic assay program set up: (Advanced Kinetics) as follows: wave length 420nm, interval time (Sec) 2.0, total run time (sec) 14.0, factor 1.000, low limit -000000.00, high limit 999999.00, and the reaction order was first. The procedure involved adding 1.5 mL of NaOAc (120mM NaOAc Buffer pH 5.0), then add 0.2 mL of ABTS (4.5mM ABTS),to the cuvette, then to blank the cuvette, adding 0.05 mL of the enzyme sample to the cuvette, mixing quickly and well and, finally, measuring the change of absorption at 420nm, every 2 seconds for 14 seconds. One ABTS unit is defined as change of A420 per minute (given no dilution to the sample). Calculation of ABTS U/mL: (change in Δ420/min * dilution factor). EXAMPLE 6: Analysis of Laccase Production Using NSP24 and CBH1 Signal Sequences When the T. reesei CBH1 signal sequence was operably linked to the laccase gene expression was improved 4-5 fold over the initial CBH1 fusion strain alone in shake flasks and 5-6 fold in a 14 liter fermentor (data not shown). When the T. reesei NSP24 signal sequence was used, the expression improved 3-4 fold in shake flasks and 4-5 fold in a 14 liter fermentor. Three clones were analyzed in the shake flasks for the CBH1 signal sequence) and two clones were analyzed for the NSP24 signal sequence and the expression was analyzed at 3 days, 4 days and 5 days. A single clone of each was analyzed in the 14 liter fermentors. Finally, it should be noted that there are alternative ways of implementing the present invention.
