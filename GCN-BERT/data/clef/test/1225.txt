COMLPLETE SPECIFICATION TITLE GOLF CLUB FIELD OF INVENTION The invention relates to golf club and in particular to wedges. BACKGROUND Golf is a sport played on a green where the object is to hit a ball from a designated starting point into a hole. Most golf holes are designed to be played in two or more shots. To make golf more challenging hazards are included in golf holes. The hazards can include trees, water, rough ground and bunkers. Bunkers are typically sandy hollows. A ball landing in rough ground or a bunker must be played from where it lands. To overcome the difficulties in playing shots from different surfaces and trying to hit shots over different distances golf clubs with different features have been developed. For example irons are used to hit golf balls long distances, putters are used to make the final shot, or shots from the green into the hole and wedges can be used to move balls out of hazards like rough ground and bunkers or to position a ball on a fairway or green. It is an object of a preferred embodiment of the present invention to go at least some way towards providing a golf club with a high camber portion of the sole and a low camber portion of the sole. While this object applies to the preferred embodiment, it should be understood that it is not intended to limit the scope of the claims. This is because the object of the invention per se is simply to provide golf players with a useful choice. The term “comprising” and derivatives thereof, e.g. “comprises”, if and when used herein in relation to a combination of features should not be taken as excluding the possibility that the combination may have further unspecified features. For example, a statement that an arrangement “comprises” certain parts does not mean that it cannot also, optionally, have additional parts. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In broad terms in one aspect the invention comprises a golf club comprising: a shaft; and a head the head extending from the shaft and having a ball striking face and a back, the back having a substantially stepped portion sufficient to reduce the likelihood of obstructive contact between the head and underlying ground material when the club is swung. Optionally the head has a toe, a heel and a sole, and the sole has a high portion towards the toe and a low portion towards the heel. Optionally the high portion is substantially cambered. Optionally the stepped portion is generally parallel to the striking face. Optionally the portion of the back that is not stepped extends over approximately half the length of the back of the club from the toe. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS Some preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which: Figure 1 shows the ball striking face of a golf club; Figure 2 is an end-on view of the golf club of figure 1 ; and Figure 3 is a back perspective view of the golf club of figures 1 and 2. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Figure 1 shows a golf club comprising a shaft 1 and a head with ball striking face 2. The head has a toe 3 and heel 4. A sole 5 is underneath the ball striking face 2. The head may also include a hosel 6 and ferrule 7 where the head extends from the shaft 1. Shaft 1 may include a grip at the end not shown where the player holds the club. Grooves may be formed on the ball striking face of the head. These grooves allow the ball to develop spin once it has been hit by a club. Figure 2 is an end-on view of the golf club of figure 1. This view shows the ball striking face 2, sole 5 and back 8 of the club. As can be seen in figure 2 the back of the club has a narrower portion near the top edge 11 of the club and a wider portion near the sole of the club. The camber of the sole of the club is the roundness from both the front to back of the sole and the heel to toe of the sole. The amount of camber affects the playability of the club. A cambered sole helps the club move smoothly across the surface. Figure 3 shows the back 8 of the club of figures 1 and 2. The back 8 includes an upper portion 12 that is substantially parallel to the ball striking face of the club 2 and the lower portion by the sole of the club. As can be seen in figure 3 the lower portion is stepped into include a portion 9 stepped out from the back of the club and a portion 10 that is generally parallel to the ball striking surface of the club. Although shown as a hard step in figure 3 the step between the stepped out portion 9 and stepped in portion 10 may have any suitable shape. It may be a soft curve or angle. The stepped out portion 9 forms a high camber area and the stepped in portion 10 forms a low camber area. When the club is used the low camber area 10 does not interrupt the flow of dirt of other ground material. The high camber area 9 slows down the area of contact through dirt. Obstructive contact between the head and the underlying ground material when the club contacts a ball on the grounds is reduced by the shape of the club. The low camber area 10 does not interrupt the flow of the ground material and the high camber area 9 slows down the area of contact through the ground material. The effect of the shape of head is to create additional lift to a ball struck by the club when compared to a club with no low camber area. The club may be formed from any suitable material. Clubs are commonly formed from metal or carbon fibre but any suitable material or combination of materials may be used. While some preferred forms of the invention have been described by way of example it should be appreciated that modifications and improvements can occur without departing from the scope of the appended claims. 1. A golf club comprising:a shaft; anda headthe head extending from the shaft and having a ball striking face and a back, the back having a substantially stepped portion sufficient to reduce the likelihood of obstructive contact between the head and underlying ground material when the club is swung. 2. A golf club as claimed in claim 1 wherein the head has a toe, a heel and a sole, and the sole has a high portion towards the toe and a low portion towards the heel. 3. A golf club as claimed in claim 2 wherein the high portion is substantially cambered. 4. A golf club as claimed in claim 1 wherein the stepped portion is generally parallel to the striking face. 5. A golf club as claimed in claim 1 or claim 4 wherein the portion of the back that is not stepped extends over approximately half the length of the back of the club from the toe.
