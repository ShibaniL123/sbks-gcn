PROTECTED SCALE INHIBITORS AND METHODS RELATING THERETO BACKGROUND [0001] The present invention relates to treatment fluids that comprise protected scale inhibitors, and methods relating thereto. [0002] Subterranean formations can often include complex mixtures of aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatics, hetero-atomic molecules, anionic and cationic salts, acids, sands, silts, clays, and a vast array of other components. The conditions at which these components resided and experience during exploration and recovery operations are contributory factors to scale formation in the corresponding wellbores and related tools. As used herein, the term "scale" refers to a mineral or solid salt deposit that forms when the saturation of formation water to one or more minerals is affected by changing physical conditions (such as temperature, pressure, or composition), which causes minerals and salts previously in solution to precipitate into solids. [0003] Scale deposits can form on any surface in a wellbore operation, including subterranean formations, production tubing, gravel packing screens, and other wellbore equipment. Scale can develop almost immediately, or build up over several months before becoming noticeable. The formation of scale can decrease permeability of the subterranean formation, reduce well productivity and shorten the lifetime of production equipment, and in extreme instances restrict or even completely choke production. In order to reduce or remove scale build-up, it is generally necessary to stop production, which is both time-consuming and costly. [0004] The formation of scale is often controlled by the use of scale inhibitors. Scale inhibitors are typical compound, molecules, or polymers that have several moieties that chelate the minerals or salts that form scale, thereby inhibiting scale formation. [0005] Oftentimes, an area of a subterranean formation where scale inhibition is desired is also an area where it is desirable to place particulates (e.g., in fracturing operations or gravel packing operations where particulate packs are formed). Further, in wellbore operations that place particulates, other additives like viscosifiers or resin systems are usized. Viscosifiers typically provide for better suspensions and higher carrying capacity of the particulates in a treatment fluid, which, in turn, can yield more efficient and effective wellbore operations. Resin systems typically are used in conjunction with coatings on the particulates that can consolidate the particulates, make the particulates tacky, allow for formation fines to adhere to the particulates, and combinations thereof. Consolidated particulate packs can mitigate production the particulates and formation fines, which, in turn, enhances production efficiency. [0006] However, some viscosifiers usize metal crosslinkers and some resin systems usize amine-based resin curing agents. These two additives can interact with chelating moieties of the scale inhibitor, which reduces the efficacy of the metal crosslinkers, amine-based resin curing agents, and scale inhibitors. To mitigate this deleterious interaction, the wellbore operations may have several injections of additives, which increases time and cost. Further, delayed-release solid particles have been developed to, in effect, release the scale inhibitor after the primary function of the metal crosslinkers and amine-based resin curing agents have been achieved. These delayed-release solid particles can, however, be expensive to manufacture. Therefore, a need exists for alternative technologies that allow for delaying the activity of scale inhibitors. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0007] The following figures are included to illustrate certain aspects of the present invention, and should not be viewed as exclusive embodiments. The subject matter disclosed is capable of considerable modifications, alterations, combinations, and equivalents in form and function, as will occur to those skilled in the art and having the benefit of this disclosure. [0008] FIGURE 1 shows an illustrative schematic of a system that can deliver treatment fluids of the present invention to a downhole location. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0009] The present invention relates to treatment fluids that comprise protected scale inhibitors, and methods relating thereto. [0010] The treatment fluids and methods described herein usize a protected scale inhibitor to mitigate deleterious interactions with metal crosslinkers and amine-based resin curing agents. As used herein, the term "protected scale inhibitor" refers to a scale inhibitor having at least some of its chelating moieties functionalized with a protecting group. By protecting the chelating moieties of a scale inhibitor, the protected scale inhibitor is less effective, or in some instances with fully protected chelating moieties not effective, at chelating with metal crosslinkers and amine-based resin curing agents. Therefore, the metal crosslinkers and amine-based resin curing agents become, in effect, more effective at their respective purpose in the treatment fluid (e.g., crosslinking a polymer or gelling agent, or curing a resin), thereby allowing for less of the metal crosslinkers and amine-based resin curing agents to be used, which reduces cost and potential environmental impact. [0011] Further, in some instances, the protecting group may be removed from the protected scale inhibitor (/.℮., deprotecting the protected scale inhibitor), thereby leaving a scale inhibitor effective at inhibiting the formation of scale. In some instances, the protecting group may be chosen to provide for removal from the protected scale inhibitor overtime (e.g., via hydrolysis), which allows for no additional additives or subsequent treatments to be needed to deprotect and render active the scale inhibitor. In some instances, the protecting group may also be chosen to provide for deprotection at a time after the metal crosslinkers and amine-based resin curing agents have substantially performed their function. [0012] It should be noted that when "about" is provided herein at the beginning of a numerical list, "about" modifies each number of the numerical list. It should be noted that in some numerical listings of ranges, some lower limits listed may be greater than some upper limits listed. One skilled in the art will recognize that the selected subset will require the selection of an upper limit in excess of the selected lower limit.

One of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, will recognize the appropriate amount of amine-based resin curing agents to include in a treatment fluid described herein based on, among other things, the temperature conditions of a particular application, the type of epoxy-based compositions used, the concentration of the epoxy-based compositions, the desired degree of hardening, and/or the pH of the treatment fluid. In some embodiments, the scale inhibitor is protected with an amine that when released will act as a resin curing agent. [0026] In some embodiments, the treatment fluids described herein may further comprise a plurality of particulates (e.g., for use as proppants and/or gravel particulates). Suitable particulates may comprise any material suitable for use in subterranean operations. Suitable materials for these particulates include, but are not limited to, sand, bauxite, ceramic materials, glass materials, polymer materials, polytetrafluoroethylene materials, nut shell pieces, cured resinous particulates comprising nut shell pieces, seed shell pieces, cured resinous particulates comprising seed shell pieces, fruit pit pieces, cured resinous particulates comprising fruit pit pieces, wood, composite particulates, and combinations thereof.

One of ordinary skill in the art should understand which additives and at what concentration should be included in the treatment fluid for use in a desired method. [0029] The treatment fluids described herein may be suitable for use in a plurality of wellbore operation where metal crosslinkers and/or amine-based curing agents are usized. Some embodiments may involve introducing a treatment fluid described herein (e.g., comprising a base fluid, protected scale inhibitors, and at least one of (1) metal crosslinkers and gelling agents or (2) amine-based resin curing agents and epoxy-based compositions) into a wellbore penetrating a subterranean formation. While, such treatment fluids may be usized in several wellbore operations, the wellbore operations where these combinations are most often encountered are fracturing operations and gravel packing operations. [0030] Some embodiments may involve introducing a pad fluid into a wellbore penetrating a subterranean formation at a pressure sufficient to create or extend at least one fracture in the subterranean formation; and forming a particulate pack in the fracture with a proppant slurry comprising a plurality of particulates. The pad fluid and the proppant slurry of these operations may independently be a treatment fluid described herein (e.g., comprising a base fluid, protected scale inhibitors, and at least one of (1) metal crosslinkers and gelling agents or (2) amine-based resin curing agents and epoxy-based compositions). It should be noted that the composition of the pad fluid and the proppant slurry may have the same or different components and each component may independently be at the same or different concentrations in the two fluids. [0031] Some embodiments may further involve inhibiting scale formation in the wellbore and/or subterranean formation by deprotecting the protected scale inhibitors. Deprotection of the protected scale inhibitors may, in some embodiments, be achieved at the temperatures of some subterranean formations. Further, deprotection of the protected scale inhibitors may be achieved by reducing the pH of the treatment fluid. In some instances, a combination of pH and temperature may be used to achieve deprotection of the protected scale inhibitors. [0032] Some embodiments may further involve producing hydrocarbons from the subterranean formation. [0033] Some embodiments may involve introducing a gravel packing fluid into a wellbore penetrating a subterranean formation, the gravel pacing fluid comprising a base fluid, protected scale inhibitors, a plurality of particulates, and at least one of (1) metal crosslinkers and gelling agents or (2) amine-based resin curing agents and epoxy-based compositions; and forming a gravel pack in an annulus within a wellbore (e.g., between the wellbore and a screen disposed therein). Some embodiments may further involve inhibiting scale formation in the wellbore and/or subterranean formation by deprotecting the protected scale inhibitors. Some embodiments may further involve producing hydrocarbons from the subterranean formation. [0034] In various embodiments, systems configured for delivering the treatment fluids described herein to a downhole location are described. In various embodiments, the systems can comprise a pump fluidly coupled to a tubular, the tubular containing a treatment fluid comprising a base fluid; a protected scale inhibitor; and at least one selected from the group consisting of (1) a metal crosslinker and a gelling agent, (2) an amine-based resin curing agent and an epoxy-based composition, and (3) any combination thereof, wherein the protected scale inhibitor is a scale inhibitor with at least one chelating group functionalized with a protecting group. [0035] The pump may be a high pressure pump in some embodiments. As used herein, the term "high pressure pump" will refer to a pump that is capable of delivering a fluid downhole at a pressure of about 1000 psi or greater. A high pressure pump may be used when it is desired to introduce the treatment fluid to a subterranean formation at or above a fracture gradient of the subterranean formation, but it may also be used in cases where fracturing is not desired. In some embodiments, the high pressure pump may be capable of fluidly conveying particulate matter, such as proppant particulates, into the subterranean formation. Suitable high pressure pumps will be known to one having ordinary skill in the art and may include, but are not limited to, floating piston pumps and positive displacement pumps. [0036] In other embodiments, the pump may be a low pressure pump. As used herein, the term "low pressure pump" will refer to a pump that operates at a pressure of about 1000 psi or less. In some embodiments, a low pressure pump may be fluidly coupled to a high pressure pump that is fluidly coupled to the tubular. That is, in such embodiments, the low pressure pump may be configured to convey the treatment fluid to the high pressure pump. In such embodiments, the low pressure pump may "step up" the pressure of the treatment fluid before it reaches the high pressure pump. [0037] In some embodiments, the systems described herein can further comprise a mixing tank that is upstream of the pump and in which the treatment fluid is formulated. In various embodiments, the pump (e.g., a low pressure pump, a high pressure pump, or a combination thereof) may convey the treatment fluid from the mixing tank or other source of the treatment fluid to the tubular. In other embodiments, however, the treatment fluid can be formulated offsite and transported to a worksite, in which case the treatment fluid may be introduced to the tubular via the pump directly from its shipping container (e.g., a truck, a railcar, a barge, or the like) or from a transport pipeline. In either case, the treatment fluid may be drawn into the pump, elevated to an appropriate pressure, and then introduced into the tubular for delivery downhole. [0038] FIGURE 1 shows an illustrative schematic of a system that can deliver treatment fluids of the present invention to a downhole location, according to one or more embodiments. It should be noted that while FIGURE 1 generally depicts a land-based system, it is to be recognized that like systems may be operated in subsea locations as well. As depicted in FIGURE 1, system 1 may include mixing tank 10, in which a treatment fluid of the present invention may be formulated.
