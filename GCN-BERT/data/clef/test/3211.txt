BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for providing energy to biological tissue and, more particularly, to systems and methods for precisely sensing thermal parameters of tissue during a microwave ablation procedure. 2. Background of Related Art Energy-based tissue treatment is well known in the art. Various types of energy (e.g., electrical, ultrasonic, microwave, cryogenic, thermal, laser, etc.) are applied to tissue to achieve a desired result. Electrosurgery involves application of high radio frequency electrical current to a surgical site to cut, ablate, coagulate or seal tissue. In monopolar electrosurgery, a source or active electrode delivers radio frequency energy from the electrosurgical generator to the tissue and a return electrode carries the current back to the generator. In monopolar electrosurgery, the source electrode is typically part of the surgical instrument held by the surgeon and applied to the tissue to be treated. A return electrode is placed remotely from the active electrode to carry the current back to the generator. In tissue ablation electrosurgery, the radio frequency energy may be delivered to targeted tissue by an antenna or probe. There are several types of microwave antenna assemblies in use, e.g., monopole, dipole and helical, which may be used in tissue ablation applications. In monopole and dipole antenna assemblies, microwave energy generally radiates perpendicularly away from the axis of the conductor. Monopole antenna assemblies typically include a single, elongated conductor. A typical dipole antenna assembly includes two elongated conductors, which are linearly aligned and positioned end-to-end relative to one another with an electrical insulator placed between them. Helical antenna assemblies include a helically-shaped conductor connected to a ground plane. Helical antenna assemblies can operate in a number of modes including normal mode (broadside mode), in which the field radiated by the helix is maximum in a perpendicular plane to the helix axis, and axial mode (end fire mode), in which maximum radiation is along the helix axis. The tuning of a helical antenna assembly may be determined, at least in part, by the physical characteristics of the helical antenna element, e.g., the helix diameter, the pitch or distance between coils of the helix, and the position of the helix in relation to the probe assembly to which the helix is mounted. The typical microwave antenna has a long, thin inner conductor that extends along the longitudinal axis of the probe and is surrounded by a dielectric material. An outer conductor surrounds the dielectric material and extends along the axis of the probe. In another variation of the probe that provides effective outward radiation of energy or heating, a portion or portions of the outer conductor are selectively removed. This type of construction is typically referred to as a “leaky waveguide” or “leaky coaxial” antenna. Another variation on the microwave antenna probe involves having the tip formed in a uniform spiral pattern, such as a helix, to provide the necessary configuration for effective radiation. This variation can be used to direct energy in a particular direction, e.g., perpendicular to the axis, in a forward direction (i.e., towards the distal end of the antenna), or any combination of these directions. Invasive procedures and devices have been developed in which a microwave antenna probe is either inserted directly into a point of treatment via a normal body orifice or percutaneously inserted. Such invasive procedures and devices potentially provide better temperature control of the tissue being treated. Because of the small difference between the temperature required for denaturing malignant cells and the temperature injurious to healthy cells, a known heating pattern and predictable temperature control is important so that heating is confined to the tissue to be treated. For instance, hyperthermia treatment at the threshold temperature of about 41.5° C. generally has little effect on most malignant growth of cells. However, at slightly elevated temperatures above the approximate range of 43° C. to 45° C. or with rapid bursts of elevated temperatures, thermal damage to most types of normal cells is routinely observed. Accordingly, great care must be taken not to exceed these temperatures along the length of the ablation probe when it is placed adjacent to healthy tissue. In the case of tissue ablation, a high radio frequency electrical current in the range of about 500 MHz to about 10 GHz is applied to a targeted tissue site to create an ablation volume, which may have a particular size and shape. The ablation volume is correlated to antenna design, antenna tuning, antenna impedance and tissue impedance. Tissue impedance may change during an ablation procedure due to a number of factors, e.g., tissue denaturization or desiccation occurring from the absorption of microwave energy by tissue. Changes in tissue impedance may cause an impedance mismatch between the probe and tissue, which may affect delivery of microwave ablation energy to targeted tissue. The temperature and/or impedance of targeted tissue, and of non-targeted tissue and adjacent anatomical structures, may change at varying rates, which may be greater, or less than, expected rates. A surgeon may need to perform an ablation procedure in an incremental fashion in order to avoid exposing targeted tissue and/or adjacent tissue to excessive temperatures and/or denaturation. In certain circumstances, a surgeon may need to rely on experience and/or published ablation probe parameters to determine an appropriate ablation protocol (e.g., ablation time, ablation power level, and the like) for a particular patient. One way to monitor and control the temperature of tissue during a tissue ablation procedure is to provide feedback from a tissue sensor probe. If, however, the tissue sensor probe is positioned near a microwave ablation probe, the electromagnetic fields produced by the microwave ablation probe may reduce the accuracy and precision of the measurements of the tissue sensor probe either through direct thermal agitation of the thermal physics of the tissue sensor probe or through induced electrical current in the tissue sensor probe. One solution to this problem is to maintain an appropriate distance between the tissue sensor probe and the electromagnetic fields produced by the microwave field during a surgical procedure. It is difficult, however, to predict the location and boundary of this electromagnetic field. In addition, electromagnetic energy from other sources may interfere with the operation of the tissue sensor probe. SUMMARY The disclosed tissue sensor probe and corresponding surgical ablation system increases the speed and accuracy of temperature measurements taken near an ablation probe during a microwave ablation procedure. This is achieved by shielding a temperature sensor within the probe from electromagnetic radiation produced by the microwave ablation probe and maximizing the response time of thermal energy transfer to the temperature sensor.

FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of a microwave ablation system 10 in accordance with the present disclosure. The microwave ablation system 10 includes an electromagnetic surgical ablation probe 100 having a tapered distal tip 120 and a feed point 122. The ablation probe 100 is operatively connected by a cable 15 to connector 16, which may further operatively connect ablation probe 100 to a generator assembly 20. Generator assembly 20 may be a source of ablation energy, e.g., microwave or RF energy in the range of about 915 MHz to about 2.45 GHz. The disclosed system 10 includes a tissue sensor probe 200 that is configured to sense at least one operative parameter, e.g., a tissue temperature. In other embodiments, the tissue sensor probe 200 may be configured to sense a tissue dielectric parameter, e.g., a relative permittivity, a dielectric constant, a dielectric loss factor and/or conductivity. The tissue sensor probe 200 is operatively connected by a cable 215 to connector 18, which may further operatively connect tissue sensor probe 200 to a controller assembly 30. An actuator 40 is operatively coupled to the controller to enable a user, e.g., a surgeon, to selectively activate and de-activate the delivery of ablation energy to patient tissue. Controller 30 is operatively coupled to generator 20 to enable communication therebetween, such as without limitation, a control signal and/or a status signal. FIG. 2 illustrates a functional block diagram of an ablation system 10 in accordance with the present disclosure. The system 10 includes a controller 30 that includes one or more processors 31 operatively coupled to memory 32, a database 33, and a temperature sensor circuit 35. In other embodiments, the controller 30 may include one or more processors 31 operatively coupled to other sensor circuits (not explicitly shown), e.g., a dielectric sensor circuit, that are coupled to corresponding sensors in the tissue sensor probe 200. Processor(s) 31 may be configured to execute a set of programmed instructions for performing a method of microwave ablation as disclosed herein. Controller 30 includes actuator interface 36 that is adapted to facilitate operative coupling with actuator 40 and/or a generator interface 37 that is adapted to facilitate operative coupling with generator 20. Actuator 40 may be any suitable actuator, such as without limitation, a footswitch, a handswitch (which may be mounted on an ablation probe 100 and/or a tissue sensor probe 200), an orally-activated switch (e.g., a bite-activated switch and/or a breath-actuated switch), and the like. The processor(s) 31, memory 32, database 33, temperature sensor circuit 35, actuator interface 36 and/or generator interface 37 may be separate components or may be integrated, such as in one or more integrated circuits. The various components in the controller 30 may be coupled by one or more communication buses or signal lines 38. Memory 30 and/or database 33 may include a set of executable instructions for performing a method of microwave ablation as described herein. One or more elements of ablation system 10 may be coupled using hard-wired connections and/or a wireless link. During use, tissue sensor probe 200 may be positioned in tissue T in proximity to ablation probe 100 to obtain at least one tissue parameter. Embodiments of tissue sensor probe 200 in accordance with the present disclosure are now described with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4. The tissue sensor probe 200 may be a needle-like device having a small gauge size (e.g., 17 gauge or smaller). The tissue sensor probe 200 includes a temperature sensor 231 and interfaces with a microwave generator and controller to enable feedback and control using tissue temperature measurements from the tissue sensor probe 200. For example, the user may use the controller to set limits on the temperature of target tissue and apply high frequency energy to the target tissue based on temperature limits and the measured tissue temperature. Referring to FIG. 3, the tissue sensor probe 200 is configured to form a “Faraday cage” or a “Faraday shield.” A Faraday cage is an enclosure or a container made of electrically-conductive material that can shield its interior from external electromagnetic radiation if the electrically-conductive material has an appropriate thickness. In operation, an external electrical field causes the electrical charges within the Faraday cage's electrically-conductive material to redistribute so as to cancel the external electrical field's effects in the Faraday cage's interior. The tissue sensor probe 200 includes an electrically-conductive enclosure configured as a Faraday cage, which contains a temperature sensor 231. In this way, the temperature sensor 231 is isolated from any electromagnetic radiation, including microwave radiation, originating external to the probe 200. The probe 200 includes an elongated, generally-cylindrical shaft 223 having a proximal end 213 and a distal end 216. In some embodiments, the elongated shaft 223 is a cylindrical hypo-tube made of stainless steel or other electrically-conductive metal such as aluminum or copper. The distal end 216 of the shaft 223 includes an electrically-conductive tip 221, such as a metal trocar tip. The tip 221 is made of an electrically-conductive material that also has high thermal conductivity, such as copper, silver, gold, or any alloys of these materials. In some embodiments, the electrically-conductive material may also have physical properties that allow the tip 221 to keep its sharpness for long periods. An electrical connection is made completely around the junction between the tip 221 and the elongated shaft 223, either by close physical contact or by soldering or laser welding, to form a tight, electrically-conductive enclosure that can block electromagnetic radiation, such as microwave radiation. A thermally-conductive material 233 is disposed inside the elongated shaft 223 at its distal end 216 directly behind and in contact with the tip 221. In some embodiments, the tip 221 may include a hollow center in which thermally-conductive material 233d is disposed. For example, the thermally-conductive material 233d may be a high thermally-conductive gel. The thermally-conductive material 233 may have high thermal conductivity, but low electrical conductivity. The thermally-conductive material 233 may include gold, silver, copper, a thermally-conductive gel or polymer, or any combination of these materials. A temperature sensor 231, such as a thermistor or thermocouple, is disposed inside the thermally-conductive material 233 in such a way as to be electrically isolated from the electrically-conductive tip 221 and elongated shaft 223. The temperature sensor 231 may be affixed within the tissue sensor probe 200 using a thermally-conductive adhesive or epoxy. The thermally-conductive material 233 rapidly transfers heat from the body tissue to the temperature sensor 231 to provide accurate and precise temperature measurements of the body tissue. The temperature sensor 231 is connected to electrically-insulated leads 235, such as wires coated with plastic insulation or a vapor-deposited insulator. The wires 235 emerge from the thermally-conductive material and are coupled to a shielded cable 215 at the proximal end 213 of the tissue sensor probe 200. The wires 235 may twist about each other to form a twisted pair. The far proximal end of the elongated shaft 223 is capped or closed with an electrically-conductive metallic plate 237. A bulkhead-like port 225, which maintains electrical isolation from the external environment, passes through the plate 237 and enables a transition to the shielded cable 215. The twisted pair of tissue sensor probe wires 235 passes through the port 225 into the shielded cable 215. The shield of the cable 215 may be a wire braid or solid cylindrical conductor. An ergonomic handle 227, such as molded plastic that provides an attractive device appearance, is positioned at the proximal end 213 of the tissue sensor probe 200. Thus, the cylindrical elongated shaft 223, the tip 221, and the cap 237 form an electrically-conductive enclosure that isolates the temperature sensor 231 from any electromagnetic interference external to the tissue sensor probe 220. At the same time, the thermally-conductive tip 221 and the thermally-conductive material 233 can quickly transmit thermal energy at or near the exterior of the tissue sensor probe 200 to the temperature sensor 231 to ensure a fast thermal response by the temperature sensor 231. The type of electrically-conductive material used to form the cylindrical elongated shaft 223, the tip 221, and the cap 237, and other parameters of the electrically-conductive material (e.g., thickness) may be selected based on parameters of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the microwave probe (e.g., frequency, phase, or polarization). The parameters for the electrically-conductive material may also be selected based on parameters of the electromagnetic radiation from another source. The surgical ablation system may include multiple tissue sensor probes 200. The tissue sensor probes 200 may be placed at the margin of a target tissue structure to make sure that critical tissue structures are not harmed by elevated temperatures created by a microwave ablation probe (e.g., ablation probe 200). FIG. 4 illustrates a side, cross-sectional view of a tissue sensor probe 200 in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure. The thermally-conductive material 233d may extend within a hollow portion of the tip 221. Thermally-conductive material 233b, 233c may also be disposed within the elongated shaft 223 at different positions along the length of the elongated shaft 223. Temperature sensors 231b, 231c are disposed within the thermally-conductive material 233b, 233c and connect to the leads or wires 235. In this configuration, the temperature of tissue near each temperature sensor 233a-233c may be measured to obtain a temperature gradient or profile of the tissue along the length of the elongated shaft 223. For example, the tissue sensor probe 200 may be oriented parallel to an ablation probe to measure the temperature radiating up the ablation probe. To ensure accurate temperature measurements, the elongated shaft 223 or those portions of the elongated shaft 223 that make contact with the thermally-conductive material 233b, 233c may be made of a thermally-conductive material. The probe 200 may include one or more absorbent sleeves 214 disposed on the elongated shaft 223 and adapted to attract and absorb moisture, e.g., steam and/or condensed water vapor, which may be released as a byproduct of an ablation procedure and collect on the elongated shaft 223. In some embodiments, absorbent sleeve(s) 214 is slidably disposed on the elongated shaft 223 to enable the selective absorption of moisture, and/or to enable a surgeon to position sleeve 214 according to surgical requirements. Sleeve(s) 214 may be formed from any suitable biocompatible absorbent material, including without limitation paper-based material composed of virgin wood pulp that is obtained from certified forests. Probe 200 includes a handle 227 positioned at a proximal end 213 of the probe 200. Handle 227 may include grip-enhancing features such as, without limitation, knurling, ridges, coatings (e.g., silicone-based or rubberized coating) disposed on at least a part of an outer surface of the handle 227. Probe 200 includes a cable 215 extending from the probe 200 that is adapted to operatively couple the temperature sensor 231 with temperature sensor circuit 35. The elongated shaft 223 of the probe 200 may have any suitable length and/or diameter suitable for use in an ablation procedure. In some embodiments, the elongated shaft 223 has a length of about 10 cm to about 30 cm. Tissue sensor probe 200 includes a temperature sensor 231 disposed at a distal end 211 of the probe shaft 223. Temperature sensor 231 may include any suitable temperature-sensing transducer, including without limitation, a fluoroptic (e.g., fiber optic) sensor, a thermocouple, a thermistor, an infrared thermometer (e.g., emissive measurement), a resistance thermometer (also referred to as a resistive temperature detector or resistive thermal device (RTD)), or other temperature sensor now or in the future known. Temperature sensor 231 is operatively coupled to temperature sensor circuit 35 via connection element 218, which may include electrical and/or fiber optic conductors. Temperature sensor circuit 35 is adapted to receive a temperature measurement signal from temperature sensor 231 to determine a tissue temperature, which, in turn, may be utilized by controller 30 and/or generator 20. FIG. 5 illustrates a method 300 for operating a microwave ablation system 10, which includes the generator 20, the controller 30, the ablation probe 100, and the tissue sensor probe 200. The method 300 begins in step 301 wherein one or more initializations may be performed, e.g., power-on self test (POST), memory allocation, input/output (I/O) initialization, and the like. In step 305, it is determined whether an activation signal is present, e.g., whether actuator 40 has been engaged by a user to cause delivery of ablation energy to the tissue. If no activation signal is present, the process iterates until an activation signal is detected (e.g., the system enters a “wait state”). Upon receipt of an activation signal, an ablation generator, e.g., generator 20, is activated in step 315 to deliver ablation energy to tissue via the ablation probe 100. In step 315, an ablation control signal may be generated by controller 30 and conveyed to ablation generator 20 via generator interface 37. In step 320, a tissue temperature measurement T is obtained. Tissue temperature measurement T is obtained from temperature sensor 231 of tissue sensor probe 200. In step 345, a tissue temperature measurement is used to determine a tissue status S. Tissue status S may be indicative of whether the sensed tissue has received insufficient, sufficient, and/or excessive ablation energy, e.g., whether the tissue is underablated (“undercooked”), ablated (“cooked”), or hyper-ablated (“charred”). Other tissue statuses are envisioned, for example, a near-ablated (“pre-cooked”) status. A lookup table (not explicitly shown) may be utilized to ascertain tissue status based upon temperature. In other embodiments, the lookup table may be used to ascertain tissue status based upon temperature, permittivity, and loss factor. For example, the lookup table may have a three-dimensional organization whereby a first table dimension is representative of tissue temperature, a second table dimension is representative of tissue permittivity, and a third table dimension is representative of tissue loss factor. In this manner, each of temperature, permittivity, and loss factor are thus used as indices into the three dimensional table to identify a particular tissue status corresponding thereto. In some embodiments, the lookup table may be included within database 33. In step 350, a tissue status signal may be reported to a user via any suitable manner of communication, such as without limitation, an audible signal, a visual signal, a haptic (tactile) signal, and/or a combination of these signals. By way of example only, an underablated status may be excluded from reporting, since this is routinely observed and expected during an initial phase of an ablation procedure. As tissue approaches ablated status, e.g., attains near-ablated status, a first tissue status signal, e.g., a short audible signal, may be issued to apprise a user accordingly. When tissue reaches ablated status, a second tissue status signal may be issued, e.g., a more urgent audible signal, alone or in combination with a visual signal. In some embodiments, multiple tissue statuses may be utilized to convey a continuous indication of ablation progress. In this manner, a user may be assisted in the accurate and timely assessment of ablation progress, in real-time, during an ablation procedure. A tissue status may be associated with a terminal condition whereby attainment of a terminal status indicates that the ablation procedure is complete and/or that delivery of ablation is to be terminated. In step 355, a determination is made whether the currently-identified tissue status is a terminal status. If the current tissue status is not a terminal status, the process iterates step 305 whereupon presence of an activation signal is confirmed, and the ablation procedure continues as just described. Conversely, if a terminal status is reached, the ablation process concludes at step 360. It is to be understood that the steps of the method provided herein may be performed in combination and/or in a different order than presented herein without departing from the scope and spirit of the present disclosure. During use, tissue sensor probe 200 is positioned at a boundary of the operative site that corresponds to an outer limit of the desired ablation region. As ablation energy is applied to targeted tissue (e.g., generator 20 is activated and ablation probe 100 is applied to the operative site), tissue sensor probe 200 provides tissue parameters (e.g., temperature and dielectric properties) to controller 30. As the ablated region expands, controller 30 continues to monitor tissue status at the probed location. When a tissue terminal status is detected (e.g., tissue is “cooked”), controller 30 causes generator 20 to be deactivated, thus enabling a surgeon to perform a precisely-formed ablation, which may lead to improved operative outcomes, reduced operative and/or recovery times, and enhanced patient satisfaction. A distal end 216 of tissue sensor probe 200 may be generally positioned coincident with a plane radially extending transversely from feed point 122 of the ablation probe 100. Tissue sensor probe 200 may be positioned between an ablation region and an adjacent anatomical structure, which may be a critical structure to be protected from receipt of excessive ablation energy, increased temperature, and/or undesired denaturization which may occur as a side effect of an ablation procedure. In this instance, a tissue terminal status may reflect a threshold at which an ablation procedure is suspended in order to protect a critical structure from damage. The described embodiments of the present disclosure are intended to be illustrative rather than restrictive, and are not intended to represent every embodiment of the present disclosure.
