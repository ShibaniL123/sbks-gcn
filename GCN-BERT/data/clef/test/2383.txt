In this embodiment, the window pocket scarf 100 comprises a length of fabric 102 having a first end 121, a second end 122, a front surface 107 and a rear surface 108. In particular embodiments: (1) the scarf's front surface 107 comprises a first piece of elongated rectangular material; and (2) the scarf's rear surface 108 comprises a second piece of elongated rectangular material. The first and second elongated pieces of material may, for example, be substantially the same size and shape. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the first and second pieces of elongated rectangular material are sewn together about their respective perimeters. They also may be sewn together about one or more lateral sewing lines 115-118. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the scarf's first and second lateral sewing lines 115, 116, and first and second lateral edges 123, 124 serve as the boundaries of a pocket 101 that is defined by respective first distal portions of the scarf's front and rear surfaces 107, 108. The scarf 100 may further define an elongated access opening and a zipper 104 disposed adjacent the access opening that is adapted for selectively restricting access into an interior portion of the pocket through the elongated access opening. In various embodiments, the length of fabric 102 may comprise any suitable material (e.g., cotton, wool, leather or any other suitable material). The length of fabric 102 may comprise a single piece of fabric or may comprise a plurality of fabric pieces constructed using any appropriate fabric fastening technique (e.g., sewing or fabric welding). In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the scarf's front surface 107 defines a first opening 103. In particular embodiments, the first opening 103 may be sized to allow a user of the window pocket scarf 100 to view at least a portion of a screen of a wireless device through the first opening 103 when the wireless device is disposed within the pocket 101. In particular embodiments, the first opening 103 is defined by the front wall of the pocket 101. In certain embodiments, the first opening 103 is sized to allow a user to view substantially all (e.g., all) of the screen of a particular wireless device (e.g., an iPhone, Windows Phone, Android Phone, or any other particular wireless device) through the first opening 103. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the first opening 103 is substantially rectangular (e.g., rectangular). In this embodiment, the first opening 103 may, for example, be sized between about 3.25 and about 3.75 inches wide and between about 5.25 and about 5.5 inches tall. In various embodiments, the first opening 103 is defined adjacent the scarf's first end 121 at least about five inches from the first end 121. In this embodiment, the distal end of the first opening 103 is substantially parallel (e.g., parallel) to the scarf's first end 121. In other embodiments, the first opening 103 may be defined on any suitable part of the scarf (e.g., it may be defined a different distance from the scarf's first end 121 and/or adjacent the scarf's second end 122). In particular embodiments, the first opening 103 may be at least substantially covered (e.g., covered) with a first transparent material (e.g., one or more sheets of material) which may, for example, serve as a transparent window into the interior of the pocket 101. In particular embodiments, the first transparent material may be affixed adjacent (e.g., to) the scarf 100 using any appropriate fastening technique (e.g., sewing or fabric welding). In various embodiments, the first transparent material is sufficiently thin, transparent, and/or flexible to allow a user to operate a wireless device through the first transparent material while the wireless device is positioned within the pocket 101. The first transparent material may comprise any suitable material to allow a user to view the screen of and operate a wireless device through the first transparent material (e.g., PET material or vinyl). In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the scarf's rear surface 108 defines a second opening 106. In this embodiment, the second opening 106 is disposed adjacent (e.g., immediately adjacent) the first opening 103. In particular embodiments, the first and second openings 103, 106 are co-facing. In particular embodiments, the second opening 106 may be adapted to at least substantially align (e.g., align) with the sides of the first opening 103 and may also be adapted to at least substantially align (e.g., align) with a lens of a camera of a wireless device disposed within the pocket 101. In various embodiments, the second opening 106 may be defined adjacent the first opening 103 such that when the second opening 106 is substantially aligned (e.g., aligned) with the lens of a camera of a wireless device positioned within the pocket 101, the first opening 103 is substantially aligned (e.g., aligned) with a screen of the wireless device. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the second opening 106 is sized smaller than the first opening 103 and is defined adjacent (e.g., immediately adjacent) a distal end of the first opening 103. In other embodiments, the first opening 103 and the second opening 106 may be substantially the same (e.g., the same) size and have substantially the same vertical and/or lateral alignment on opposite sides of the scarf 100. In other embodiments, the second opening 106 may be sized larger than the first opening 103. In particular embodiments, the second opening 106 may be substantially covered (e.g., covered) by a second transparent material. The second transparent material may, for example, be affixed to the length of fabric 102 using any appropriate fastening technique (e.g., sewing or fabric welding). In various embodiments, the second transparent material may be adapted to not substantially interfere (e.g., not interfere) with the operation of the camera of a wireless device when a picture is taken with the camera through the second transparent material. The second transparent material may comprise any suitable material that is adapted to not substantially interfere with the operation of the camera of a wireless device when the camera is operated through the second transparent material (e.g., PET material or vinyl). In particular embodiments, the second transparent material may comprise the same material as the first transparent material. In various embodiments, the window pocket scarf 100 may include a secondary accessory pocket 105, which may be, for example, defined by two elongated rectangular pieces of fabric that form the scarf 100 as discussed above. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the secondary accessory pocket 105 is disposed adjacent the second end 122 of the scarf 100. As shown in FIG. 1, in various embodiments, the secondary accessory pocket 105 includes a zipper 109. In various embodiments, the secondary accessory pocket 105 may be adapted to hold personal items (e.g., a wallet, passport, or keys). Exemplary Use of Window Pocket Scarf FIG. 4 shows the window pocket scarf 100 worn around the neck of a user. As may be understood from FIG. 4, a user may wear the window pocket scarf 100 around their neck in any suitable manner. For example, a user may tie the window pocket scarf 100 around their neck, wrap the window pocket scarf 100 around their neck, or wear the window pocket scarf 100 in any other suitable manner. As shown in FIG. 4, when using the window pocket scarf 100, a user may insert a wireless device 202 into the scarf's pocket 101 by: (1) opening the zipper 104 of the scarf's first pocket 101; (2) inserting the wireless device into the pocket 101 with the wireless device's screen facing the first opening 103 and the wireless device's camera lens aligned with the second opening 106, and (3) closing the zipper 104. In embodiments in which the pocket 101 does not include a zipper 104, the user may open whatever mechanism the pocket 101 includes for opening and closing the pocket 101 or may simply insert the wireless device into the pocket 101 through a suitable opening in the pocket 101. Once the user has inserted the wireless device into the pocket 101, the user may wear the window pocket scarf 100 as shown in FIG. 4. As may be understood from this figure, when a user is wearing the window pocket scarf 100, the pocket 101 containing the wireless device 202 may hang a distance below the user's neck. In particular embodiments, the distance may be between about one foot and about two and a half feet. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, the pocket 101 containing the wireless device 202 hangs at least about eighteen inches below the user's neck. In particular embodiments, the scarf's pocket 101 may be adapted to hang substantially adjacent (e.g., to) a lower portion of the user's chest. When the user desires to operate the wireless device 202, the user may lift and reorient (e.g., flip) the wireless device 202 (while the phone remains in a relatively fixed position relative to the pocket 101) to a position in which the user is able to view and manipulate the screen of the wireless device 202 through the first opening (e.g., by touching the exterior surface of the transparent material covering the first opening 103 in a manner needed to operate a touch screen associated with the wireless device 202). When the user desires to take a photograph using the wireless device's camera, the user may simply point the wireless device's camera lens toward the object that the user wishes to photograph (e.g., while the wireless device 202 is still within the scarf's pocket 101). The user may then operate the wireless device 202 (e.g., through the material covering the scarf's first opening 103) to cause the wireless device 202 to take a photograph through the material covering the scarf's second opening 106, which may, for example, be sufficiently clear to not significantly interfere with a photograph taken through the material. In particular embodiments, as shown in FIG. 4, the scarf 100 may be configured so that when a wireless device 202 is properly inserted into the pocket 101, the wireless device 202 is oriented upside down (e.g., so that the wireless device's display screen faces away from the user's body) when the user is wearing the window pocket scarf 100. In such embodiments, to operate the device in a right side up orientation, the user may lift and invert the wireless device 202 into a right side up orientation (e.g., in which the wireless device's display screen is facing the user) before using the device. This may, for example, allow a user to avoid re-orientating (e.g., twisting or turning) the pocket 101 excessively when operating the wireless device 202. Alternative Embodiments Alternative embodiments of the window pocket may comprise, for example, components that are, in some respects, similar to the various components described above. Selected distinguishing features of various alternative embodiments are discussed below. Window Pocket Scarf without a Second Opening In particular embodiments, a window pocket scarf may include only a first opening. In such embodiments, the window pocket scarf may be adapted to allow a user to operate a wireless device through the first opening but may not be particularly suitable for allowing the user to operate a camera associated with the wireless device while the wireless device is within the scarf's first pocket. Window Pocket Belt In particular embodiments, a pocket 101 may be combined with (e.g., attached to) a standard belt 403. As shown in FIG. 5, the pocket 101 may include an opening 304 that may be sized to fit the cord of earphones or similar accessories for use with a wireless device stored within the scarf's pocket 101. The belt 403 may be adapted to be worn around a user's waist. Window Pocket Sash In particular embodiments, a pocket 101 may be combined with (e.g., attached to) a standard sash 303. The standard sash 303 may be adapted to be worn over a user's shoulder. Detachable Window Pocket In particular embodiments, a pocket may be adapted for selective removal from a particular garment. For example, a pocket may be disposed on a scarf and adapted to be selectively removed from and attached to the scarf. The selective removal of the pocket may be achieved via any suitable means (e.g., via a suitable hook-and-loop faster or zipper). Window Pocket Scarf for Wireless Device with Multiple Cameras In particular embodiments, a pocket may be adapted for use with a wireless device comprising multiple cameras. In such embodiments, the length of fabric may define additional openings that are adapted to align with each camera lens of the mobile device. Particular mobile devices may comprise a first camera lens on the rear of the mobile device and a second camera lens on the front of the mobile device. In particular embodiments, a window pocket scarf may be adapted to allow a user to operate both of the wireless devices' cameras while the wireless device is positioned within the pocket. Reversible Window Pocket Scarf In particular embodiments, the window pocket scarf may include a strip of fabric that is positioned to cover the rear of the pocket that holds the wireless device (e.g., the pocket may either not have a rear window, or the scarf may include an extra piece of fabric that selectively covers the rear window.) In such embodiments, a user may wear the window pocket scarf with the first opening facing outwardly to reveal the wireless device, or the user may wear the window pocket scarf with the first opening against the user's body to conceal the pocket and the wireless device. Waterproof Window Pocket Scarf In particular embodiments, the pocket may be substantially waterproof (e.g., waterproof). In such embodiments, the pocket is adapted to protect a wireless device that is disposed within the pocket from water.
