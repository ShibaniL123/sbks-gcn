Example 7
To a suspension of N-(4-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)phenyl)acetamide (0.200 g, 0.857 mmol) and 2,4-dimethylthiazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.184 g, 0.943 mmol), and pyridine (0.31 mL, 3.862 mmol) in acetonitrile (8 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 1.79 mL, 3.001 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 48.5° C. for 5 days. After cooling, the mixture was quenched with water (100 mL) and extracted with 8:2 dichloromethane/isopropanol (2×100 mL) followed by washing once with sat. NaHCO3 (200 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by precipitating in dichloromethane and filtration to give N-(4-(4-acetamidophenyl)thiazol-2-yl)-2,4-dimethylthiazole-5-carboxamide (0.141 g, 44%) as a beige solid.
