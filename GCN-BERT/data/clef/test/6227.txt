TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to immunogenic compositions comprising a Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) polypeptide and an aluminum-free adjuvant. The invention also relates to vaccine compositions and the use of the vaccines and immunogenic compositions of the invention in prophylaxis or therapy or in the manufacture of a medicament. BACKGROUND C.difficile is the most important cause of nosocomial intestinal infections and is the major cause of pseudomembranous colitis in humans (Bartlett et al Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 11 suppl: 2521-6 (1980)). The overall associated mortality rate for individuals infected with C.difficile was calculated to be 5.99% within 3 months of diagnosis, with higher mortality associated with advanced age, being 13.5% in patients over 80 years (Karas et al Journal of Infection 561:1-9 (2010)). The current treatment for C.difficile infection is the administration of antibiotics (metronidazole and vancomycin), however there has been evidence of strains which are resistant to these antibiotics (Shah et al., Expert Rev. Anti Infect. Ther. 8(5), 555-564 (2010)). Accordingly there is a need for immunogenic compositions capable of inducing antibodies to, and/or a protective immune response to, C.difficile. The enterotoxicity of C.difficile is primarily due to the action of two toxins, toxin A (‘ToxA’) and toxin B (‘ToxB’). The C-terminal domains of toxin A and toxin B comprise repeating units, for example the C-terminal domain of toxin A is made up of contiguous repeating units (Dove et al Infect. Immun. 58:480-499 (1990)). For this reason the C-terminal domain may be referred to as the ‘repeating domain’. These repeat portions can be separated further into short repeats (SRs) and long repeats (LRs) as described in Ho et al (PNAS 102:18373-18378 (2005)). Immunogenic compositions comprising antigens from C. difficile have been described. WO96/12802 and WO00/61762 and Lyerly et al (Current Microbiology 21:29-32 (1990)) relate to fragments of toxin A, in particular fragments of the C-terminal domain, for inducing a protective immune response in hamsters. WO9920304 relates to a mixture of co-purified toxin A and toxin B inactivated by incubation in formaldehyde. WO00/61762 relates to immunogenic compositions comprising either the full length C-terminal domain or fragments of the C-terminal domain of toxin A and toxin B of C.difficile. Similarly WO2012/163817, WO2012/163811 and WO2012/163810 provide disclosures of possible fragments of toxin A and toxin B as well as fusion proteins thereof. New compositions or vaccines with improved immunogenicity are needed. As one strategy, adjuvants have been used to try and improve the immune response raised to any given antigen. For example, WO2009035707 describes a composition comprising a toxoid of C. difficile toxins A and B and an adjuvant such as aluminum hydroxide compound. Adjuvants containing combinations of lipopolysaccharide and Quillaja saponins have been disclosed previously, for example in EP0671948. Oil in water emulsions per se are well known in the art, and have been suggested to be useful as adjuvant compositions (EP 399843; WO 95/17210). There is still a need for vaccine and immunogenic compositions that provide a suitable immune response against C.difficile. SUMMARY In one aspect, the invention relates to an immunogenic composition comprising a polypeptide comprising a Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) toxin A fragment and/or a C. difficile toxin B fragment and an adjuvant comprising an immunologically active saponin fraction presented in the form of a liposome.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The inventors have shown immunogenic compositions comprising a polypeptide comprising a C. difficile toxin A fragment and/or a C. difficile toxin B fragment formulated with alum free adjuvants, particularly adjuvants such as Adjuvant A and Adjuvant B described herein, provide an improved immune response against C.difficile as compared to non-adjuvanted C. difficile polypeptide containing compositions. Immunogenic compositions according to the invention may also provide an improved immune response against C.difficile as compared to C. difficile polypeptides formulated with alum. Polypeptides The polypeptide comprising a C. difficile toxin A fragment and/or a C. difficile toxin B fragment may comprise purified toxin A or toxin B which have been inactivated, suitably by incubation in formaldehyde, such as those described in WO9920304. The polypeptide may comprise a C. difficile toxin A N-terminal fragment and a C. difficile toxin B repeating domain fragment. The polypeptide may contain a C. difficile toxin A repeating domain fragment and a C. difficile toxin B N-terminal fragment. The polypeptide may comprise a C. difficile toxin A repeating domain fragment and a C. difficile toxin B repeating domain fragment. The polypeptide may comprise either the full length N-terminal and/or C-terminal domain of toxin A and toxin B of C.difficile or fragments thereof. In one embodiment, the polypeptide in the immunogenic compositions according to the invention does not contain the full length N-terminal domain of toxin A and/or toxin B of C.difficile. In one embodiment, the polypeptide in the immunogenic compositions according to the invention does not contain an N-terminal domain fragment of toxin A and/or toxin B of C.difficile. The polypeptide may be a fusion protein. For example, the fusion protein may comprise a fusion sequence such as Seq ID NOS: 36 and 37 or other sequences described in WO2012/028741. The polypeptide may comprise a first fragment and a second fragment, wherein (i) the first fragment is a toxin A repeating domain fragment; (ii) the second fragment is a toxin B repeating domain fragment; (iii) the first fragment comprises a first proximal end within a first repeat portion; (iv) the second fragment comprises a second proximal end within a second repeat portion; and wherein the first fragment and the second fragment are adjacent to one another and wherein the first repeat portion and the second repeat portion have structural similarity. The term polypeptide refers to a contiguous sequence of amino acids. The term ‘toxin A repeating domain’ refers to the C-terminal domain of the toxin A protein from C.difficile comprising repeated sequences. For example, the C-terminal domain of the toxin A protein may be amino acids 1832-2710 of toxin A from strain VPI10463 (ATCC43255) and/or their equivalent in a different strain. Amino acids 1832-2710 of toxin A from strain VPI10463 (ATCC43255) corresponds to amino acids 1832-2710 of SEQ ID NO:1. The term ‘toxin B repeating domain’ refers to the C-terminal domain of the toxin B protein from C.difficile. For example, the C-terminal domain of the toxin B protein may be amino acids 1834-2366 of toxin B from strain VPI10463 (ATCC43255) and/or their equivalent in a different strain. Amino acids 1834-2366 of toxin B from strain VPI10463 (ATCC43255) corresponds to amino acids 1834-2366 of SEQ ID NO:2. The full length N-terminal domain of toxin A may be amino acids 1-542 of toxin A from strain VPI10463 (ATCC43255) and/or their equivalent in a different strain. Thus the term “a C. difficile toxin A N-terminal fragment” or “an N-terminal domain fragment of toxin A” refers to a fragment of amino acids 1-542 of toxin A from strain VPI10463 (ATCC43255) and/or their equivalent in a different strain. Amino acids 1-542 of toxin A from strain VPI10463 (ATCC43255) corresponds to amino acids 1-542 of SEQ ID NO: 1. The full length N-terminal domain of toxin B may be amino acids 1-543 of toxin B from strain VPI10463 (ATCC43255) and/or their equivalent in a different strain. Thus the term “a C. difficile toxin B N-terminal fragment” or “an N-terminal domain fragment of toxin B” refers to a fragment of amino acids 1-543 of toxin B from strain VPI10463 (ATCC43255) and/or their equivalent in a different strain. Amino acids 1-543 of toxin B from strain VPI10463 (ATCC43255) corresponds to amino acids 1-543 of SEQ ID NO: 2. C.difficile toxins A and B are conserved proteins. However the sequence differs a small amount between strains. Moreover the amino acid sequence for toxins A and B in different strains may differ in number of amino acids. In one embodiment, the toxin A repeating domain and/or toxin B repeating domain may be a sequence which is a variant with at least 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to amino acids 1832-2710 of SEQ ID NO:1 or a variant with at least 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to amino acids 1834-2366 of SEQ ID NO:2. In one embodiment, the toxin A N-terminal domain may be a sequence which is a variant with at least 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to amino acids 1-542 of SEQ ID NO:1. In one embodiment, the toxin B N-terminal domain may be a sequence which is a variant with at least 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity to amino acids 1-543 of SEQ ID NO: 2. A ‘variant’ is a polypeptide that varies from the referent polypeptides by conservative amino acid substitutions, whereby a residue is substituted by another with the same physico-chemical properties. Typically such substitutions are among Ala, Val, Leu and Ile; among Ser and Thr; among the acidic residues Asp and Glu; among Asn and Gln, and among the basic residues Lys and Arg; or aromatic residues Phe and Tyr. Furthermore the amino acid numbering may differ between the C-terminal domains or N-terminal domains of toxin A (or toxin B) from one strain and toxin A (or toxin B) from another strain. For this reason the term ‘equivalent in a different strain’ refers to amino acids which correspond those of a reference strain (e.g., C. difficile VPI10463), but which are found in a toxin from a different strain and which may thus be numbered differently. A region of ‘equivalent’ amino acids may be determined by aligning the sequences of the toxins from the different strains. The amino acids numbers provided throughout refer to those of strain VPI10463. The term ‘fragment’ of a polypeptide or protein refers to a contiguous portion, such as at least 100, 150, 180, 200, 230, 250, 300, 350, 380, 400, 450, 480, 500, 530, 550, 580 or 600 amino acids, from that polypeptide or protein. “N-terminal domain fragment of toxin A” of C.difficile refers to a contiguous portion, such as at least 100, 150, 180, 200, 230, 250, 300, 350, 380, 400, 450, 480, 500 or 530 amino acids, from the full length N-terminal domain of toxin A. “N-terminal domain fragment of toxin B” of C.difficile refers to a contiguous portion, such as at least 100, 150, 180, 200, 230, 250, 300, 350, 380, 400, 450, 480, 500 or 530 amino acids, from the full length N-terminal domain of toxin B. Toxin A repeating domain fragment may be a contiguous portion of at least 100, 200, 230, 250, 300, 350, 380, 400, 450, 480, 500, 530, 550, 580 or 600 amino acids from the toxin A repeating domain. Toxin A repeating domain fragment may be a contiguous portion of less than 750, less than 700, less than 650, less than 600 or less than 580 amino acids. Toxin B repeating domain fragment may be a contiguous portion of at least 100, 200, 230, 250, 300, 350, 380, 400, 450, 480, 500, 530, 550, 580 or 600 amino acids from the toxin B repeating domain. Toxin B repeating domain fragment may be a contiguous portion of less than 530, less than 500, less than 480, or less than 450 amino acids. The term first fragment′ refers to a contiguous portion of at least 100, such as 150, 180, 250, 300, 350, 380, 400, 450, 480, 500, 530, 550, 580 or 600, amino acids of the toxin A repeating domain. The term ‘second fragment’ refers to a contiguous portion of at least 100, such as 200, 230, 250, 280, 300, 350, 400, 450 or 500, amino acids of the toxin B repeating domain. The term ‘first proximal end’ refers to the end of the first fragment (Tox A fragment) which is covalently linked to the second fragment (Tox B fragment) or covalently linked to a linker sequence between the first and second fragment. The term ‘second proximal end’ refers to the end of the second fragment which is closest to the first fragment in primary structure (amino acid sequence). The C-terminal domain of toxin A is made up of 8 repeat portions (designated repeat portion I, repeat portion II, repeat portion III, repeat portion IV, repeat portion V, repeat portion VI, repeat portion VII and repeat portion VIII). Each of these repeat portions can be further divided into short repeats (SRs) and long repeats (LRs) (except for Tox A repeat portion VIII which does not have a long repeat). Each of the long repeats has some structural and sequence similarity to the other long repeats. Similarly the short repeats have some sequence and structural similarity to one another. Similarly the C-terminal domain of toxin B is made up of 5 repeat portions subdivided into SRs and LRs. Each repeat portion contains one LR and between 2 and 5 SRs (except for Tox B repeat portion V which does not have a long repeat). For the purposes of the disclosure a ‘repeat portion’ refers to one of the eight repeat portions of ToxA (designated I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII or VIII) or one of the five repeat portions of ToxB (designated I, II, III, IV or V) or a partial repeat portion from the toxin A or toxin B repeating domain. As used herein the term first repeat portion′ refers to a repeat portion (or partial repeat portion) from the toxin A repeating domain. The term ‘second repeat portion’ refers to a repeat portion (or partial repeat portion) from the toxin B repeating domain. For example, repeat portion I of ToxA contains three SRs and one LR, which can be referred to as the first SRI of ToxA, the second SRI of ToxA, the third SRI of ToxA and the LRI of ToxA, respectively. The first proximal end is considered to be within a ‘repeat portion’ if the first fragment ends in an amino acid that is within that repeat portion (i.e., the first proximal end contains only part of the repeat portion sequence). Similarly the second proximal end is considered to be within a ‘repeat portion’ if the second fragment ends in an amino acid that is within that repeat portion. For example the first proximal end is within ‘repeat portion I of ToxA if the first fragment ends with any one of amino acids 1833-1923 (inclusive) of VPI10463 or their equivalent in another strain. The first proximal end is within a ‘long repeat’ or a ‘short repeat’ if the first fragment ends in an amino acid that is within a ‘long repeat’ or a ‘short repeat’, similarly the second proximal end is within a ‘long repeat’ or a ‘short repeat’ if the second fragment ends in an amino acid that is within a ‘long repeat’ or a ‘short repeat’. The amino acid positions of each domain has been defined for toxin A and toxin B from strain VPI10463 (ATCC43255).

In another embodiment, the repeat portion of toxin B refers to amino acids 1834-1926, 1927-2057, 2058-2189, 2190-2323 or 2324-2366 of toxin B (SEQ ID NO:2) or an equivalent in a different strain of C.difficile. The term ‘short repeat’ may refer to amino acids 1832-1852, 1853-1873, 1874-1893, 1925-1944 1945-1965, 1966-1986, 1987-2007, 2008-2027, 2059-2078, 2079-2099, 2100-2120, 2121-2141, 2142-2161, 2193-2212, 2213-2233, 2234-2253, 2254-2275, 2307-2326, 2327-2347, 2348-2368, 2369-2389, 2390-2409, 2441-2460, 2461-2481, 2482-2502, 2503-2522, 2554-2573, 2574-2594, 2595-2613, 2645-2664, 2665-2686 or 2687-2710 of toxin A (SEQ ID NO:1) or amino acids 1834-1854, 1855-1876, 1877-1896, 1927-1946, 1947-1967, 1968-1987, 1988-2007, 2008-2027, 2058-2078, 2079-2099, 2100-2119, 2120-2139, 2140-2159, 2190-2212, 2213-2233, 2234-2253, 2254-2273, 2274-2293, 2324-2343 or 2344-2366 of toxin B (SEQ ID NO:2) or their equivalents in a different strain of C.difficile.

The polypeptides of the invention may be part of a larger protein such as a precursor or a fusion protein. It is often advantageous to include an additional amino acid sequence which contains sequences which aid in purification, such as multiple histidine residues, or an additional sequence for stability during recombinant production. Furthermore, addition of exogenous polypeptide or lipid tail or polynucleotide sequences to increase the immunogenic potential of the final molecule is also considered. The word ‘adjacent’ means separated by less than or exactly 20, 15, 10, 8, 5, 2, 1 or 0 amino acids in the primary structure. The fragments may be positioned such that the N-terminus of the first fragment is adjacent to the C-terminus of the second fragment, alternatively the C-terminus of the first fragment may be adjacent to the N-terminus of the second fragment, or the C-terminus of the first fragment may be adjacent to the C-terminus of the second fragment, or the N-terminus of the first fragment may be adjacent to the N-terminus of the second fragment. Two sequences will have ‘sequence similarity to one another’ if they have greater than 30%, 50%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99% or 100% sequence identity. The term ‘identity’ is known in the art. Identity is a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences or two or more polynucleotide sequences, as the case may be, as determined by comparing the sequences. In the art, “identity” also means the degree of sequence relatedness between polypeptide or polynucleotide sequences, as the case may be, as determined by the match between strings of such sequences. “Identity” can be readily calculated by known methods, including but not limited to those described in (Computational Molecular Biology, Lesk, A. M., ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1988; Biocomputing: Informatics and Genome Projects, Smith, D. W., ed., Academic Press, New York, 1993; Computer Analysis of Sequence Data, Part I, Griffin, A. M., and Griffin, H. G., eds., Humana Press, New Jersey, 1994; Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology, von Heine, G., Academic Press, 1987; and Sequence Analysis Primer, Gribskov, M. and Devereux, J., eds., M Stockton Press, New York, 1991; and Carillo, H., and Lipman, D., SIAM J. Applied Math., 48: 1073 (1988). Methods to determine identity are designed to give the largest match between the sequences tested. Moreover, methods to determine identity are codified in publicly available computer programs. Computer program methods to determine identity between two sequences include, but are not limited to, the Needle program, BLASTP, BLASTN (Altschul, S. F. et al., J. Molec. Biol. 215: 403-410 (1990)), and FASTA Pearson and Lipman Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85; 2444-2448 (1988)). The BLAST family of programs is publicly available from NCBI and other sources (BLAST Manual, Altschul, S., et al., NCBI NLM NIH Bethesda, Md. 20894; Altschul, S., et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-410 (1990)). The well known Smith Waterman algorithm may also be used to determine identity. In one example, parameters for polypeptide sequence comparison include the following: Algorithm: Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol Biol. 48: 443-453 (1970) Comparison matrix: BLOSSUM62 from Henikoff and Henikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 89:10915-10919 (1992) Gap Penalty: 10 Gap extension penalty: 0.5 A program useful with these parameters is publicly available as the ‘Needle’ program from EMBOSS package (Rice P. et al, Trends in Genetics 2000 col. 16(6):276-277). The aforementioned parameters are the default parameters for peptide comparisons (along with no penalty for end gaps). In one embodiment the first repeat portion and the second repeat portion have high structural similarity to one another. Two sequences can be considered to have high structural similarity when their sequence identity is higher than 40%, 45%, 50% or 60%. The presence of high sequence identity can be determined by using softwares that allow sequences alignment (EMBOSS, Blast, . . . ). 3D model structure could be faithfully built, using the SwissModel web server, for a protein if it shares more than 40%, 45%, 50% or 60% sequence identity with a protein having a known 3D structure. In one embodiment the polypeptide of the invention elicits antibodies that neutralise toxin A or toxin B. In a further embodiment the polypeptide elicits antibodies that neutralise toxin A. In a further embodiment the polypeptide elicits antibodies that neutralise toxin B. In a further embodiment the polypeptide elicits antibodies that neutralise toxin A and toxin B. The phrase ‘elicits neutralising antibodies’ means that the when the compositions are used to immunise a mammal, for example a mouse, a guinea pig or a human, the mammal generates neutralising antibodies. Whether a polypeptide elicits neutralizing antibodies against a toxin can be measured by immunising mice with an immunogenic composition comprising the polypeptide, collecting sera and analysing the anti-toxin titres of the sera using by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The sera could be compared to a reference sample obtained from mice which have not been immunised. An example of this technique can be found in example 6. The polypeptide of the invention elicits antibodies that neutralise toxin A if the sera against the polypeptide gives an ELISA readout more than 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 100% higher than the reference sample. In a further embodiment the polypeptide of the invention elicits a protective immune response in a mammalian host against strains of C.difficile. The phrase ‘elicit a protective immune response’ means that when the immunogenic composition of the invention is used to immunise a mammal such as a mouse, guinea pig or human, the mammal generates antibodies capable of protecting the mammal from death caused by C.difficile. In one embodiment the mammalian host is selected from the group consisting of mouse, rabbit, guinea pig, monkey, non-human primate or human. In one embodiment the mammalian host is a mouse. In a further embodiment the mammalian host is a human. Whether a polypeptide elicits a protective immune response in a mammalian host against strains of C.difficile can be determined using a challenge assay. In such an assay the mammalian host is vaccinated with the polypeptide and challenged by exposure to C.difficile. The time which the mammal survives after challenge is compared with the time which a reference mammal that has not been immunised with the polypeptide survives. A polypeptide elicits a protective immune response if a mammal immunised with the polypeptide survives at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% longer after challenge with C.difficile than a reference mammal which has not been immunised with the polypeptide. In one embodiment the polypeptide of the invention elicits a protective immune response against C.difficile in a mammal selected from the group consisting of mouse, guinea pig, monkey or human. In one embodiment the mammal is a mouse, in a further embodiment the mammal is a human. The native structure of the C-terminal (repeat) domains from toxins A and B consist of an extended β solenoid-like structure. This structure consists of primarily β sheet structures, with a minority of a helical structures as seen in Ho et al (PNAS 102:18373-18378 (2005)). The secondary structures present can be determined using circular dichroism (CD). For example, the secondary structure may be determined by measuring the shape and the magnitude of the CD spectra in the far-UV region (190-250 nm) and comparing the results with those of known structures. This can be carried out using an optical path of 0.01 cm from 178 to 250 nm, with a 1 nm resolution and bandwidth on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter, for example as seen in example 5 below. In one embodiment the first fragment comprises less than 28%, 25%, 23%, 20%, 18%, 15%, 10%, or 7% alpha helical secondary structure. In one embodiment the second fragment comprises less than 28%, 25%, 23%, 20%, 18%, 15%, 10%, or 7% alpha helical secondary structure. In a further embodiment both the first fragment and the second fragment comprise less than 28%, 25%, 23%, 20%, 18%, 15%, 10%, or 7% alpha helical secondary structure. In one embodiment the first fragment comprises more than 20%, 25%, 28%, 30%, 33%, 35%, 38%, 40%, or 42% beta sheet structure.

In a further embodiment both the first fragment and the second fragment comprises more than 20%, 25%, 28%, 30%, 33%, 35%, 38%, 40%, or 42% beta sheet structure.

In one embodiment the second proximal end is within a long repeat.

In one embodiment the first proximal end is within long repeat VII of toxin A (amino acids 2614-2644 of SEQ ID NO:1 or their equivalent in a different strain) and the second proximal end is within long repeat II of toxin B (amino acids 2028-2057 of SEQ ID NO:2 or their equivalent in a different strain). In one embodiment the first proximal end is within amino acids 2620-2660 of toxin A. In one embodiment the second proximal end is within amino acids 2030-2050 of toxin B. In a further embodiment the first proximal end is within amino acids 2620-2660 of toxin A and the second proximal end is within amino acids 2030-2050 of toxin B. In one embodiment the first fragment comprises at least 100, 150, 180, 200, 240, 250, 280, 300, 330, 350, 380, 400, 430, 450, 480, 500 or 530 amino acids.

This linker may be between the first proximal end and the second proximal end, alternatively the linker may link the distal ends of the first fragment and/or the second fragment to a further sequence of amino acids. A peptide linker sequence may be employed to separate the first fragment and second fragment. Such a peptide linker sequence is incorporated into the fusion protein using standard techniques well known in the art. Suitable peptide linker sequences may be chosen based on the following factors: (1) their ability to adopt a flexible extended conformation; (2) their inability to adopt a secondary structure that could interact with functional epitopes on the first fragment and/or the second fragments; and (3) the lack of hydrophobic or charged residues that might react with the ToxA and/or ToxB functional epitopes. Peptide linker sequences may contain Glycine(Gly), Asparagine (Asn) and Serine (Ser) residues. Other near neutral amino acids, such as Thr and Ala may also be used in the linker sequence. Amino acid sequences which may be usefully employed as linkers include those disclosed in Maratea et al., Gene 40:39-46 (1985); Murphy et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83:8258-8262 (1986); U.S. Pat. No. 4,935,233 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,751,180. The linker sequence may generally be from 1 to about 50 amino acids in length. In one embodiment the linker comprises 1-20, 1-15, 1-10, 1-5, 1-2, 5-20, 5-15, 5-15, 10-20, or 10-15 amino acids. In one embodiment the linker is a glycine linker, the linker may comprise multiple contiguous glycine residues (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, or 20), or alternatively the linker may comprise some glycine residues and some residues of other amino acids such as alanine. In a further embodiment the linker comprises a single glycine residue. In an embodiment the polypeptide of the invention is part of a larger fusion protein. The fusion proteins may further comprise amino acids encoding an immunogenic portion of a further protein antigen. For example the fusion protein may further comprise an immunogenic portion of a protein antigen obtained or derived from a bacterium selected from the group consisting of S.pneumoniae, H. influenzae, N.meningitidis, E. coli, M.cattarhalis, C.tetanfi, C.diphtheriae, B.pertussis, S.epidermidis, enterococci, S.aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this case the linker may be between the first fragment or the second fragment and a further immunogenic portion of a protein antigen. The term “immunogenic portion thereof” or ‘immunogenic fragment’ refers to a fragment of a polypeptide wherein the fragment comprises an epitope that is recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, helper T lymphocytes or B cells. Suitably, the immunogenic portion will comprise at least 30%, suitably at least 50%, especially at least 75% and in particular at least 90% (e.g. 95% or 98%) of the amino acids in the reference sequence. In one embodiment, the immunogenic portion will comprise all of the epitope regions of the reference sequence. Immunogenic compositions according to the invention comprising the specific fusion proteins of C. difficile toxin A repeating domain fragment and a C. difficile toxin B repeating domain fragment described herein are also expected to provide an improved immune response against C.difficile as compared to compositions comprising known C. difficile polypeptides or fragments. Adjuvants The immunogenic compositions disclosed herein include at least one C.difficile polypeptide in combination with an aluminum-free adjuvant. The polypeptides are formulated with an adjuvant that is free of aluminum or aluminum salts, that is, an aluminum-free adjuvant or adjuvant system. In certain embodiments, the C. difficile polypeptide is formulated with an adjuvant comprising an immunologically active saponin fraction presented in the form of a liposome. The adjuvant may further comprise a lipopolysaccharide. The adjuvant may include QS21. For example, in one embodiment, the adjuvant contains QS21 in a liposomal formulation. In one embodiment, the adjuvant system includes 3D-MPL and QS21. For example, in one embodiment, the adjuvant contains 3D-MPL and QS21 in a liposomal formulation. Optionally, the adjuvant system also contains cholesterol. In one specific embodiment, the adjuvant includes QS21 and cholesterol. Optionally, the adjuvant system contains 1, 2-Dioleoyl-sn-Glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC). For example, in one specific adjuvant system contains cholesterol, DOPC, 3D-MPL and QS21. In one specific example, the immunogenic composition includes an adjuvant formulated in a dose that includes: from about 0.1 to about 0.5 mg cholesterol; from about 0.25 to about 2 mg DOPC; from about 10 μg to about 100 μg 3D-MPL; and from about 10 μg to about 100 μg QS21. In a further specific example the immunogenic composition includes and adjuvant formulated in a dose that includes: from about 0.1 to about 0.5 mg cholesterol, from about 0.25 to about 2 mg DOPC, from about 10 μg to about 100 μg 3D-MPL, and from about 10 μg to about 100 μg QS21. In a further specific formulation the adjuvant is formulated in a dose comprising from about 0.1 to about 0.5 mg cholesterol, from about 0.25 to about 2 mg DOPC, from about 10 μg to about 70 μg 3D-MPL, and from about 10 μg to about 70 μg QS21. In one specific formulation, the adjuvant is formulated in a single dose that contains: about 0.25 mg cholesterol; about 1.0 mg DOPC; about 50 μg 3D-MPL; and about 50 μg QS21. In other embodiments, the immunogenic composition is formulated with a fractional dose (that is a dose, which is a fraction of the preceding single dose formulations, such as one half of the preceding quantity of components (cholesterol, DOPC, 3D-MPL and QS21), ¼ of the preceding quantity of components, or another fractional dose (e.g., ⅓, ⅙, etc.) of the preceding quantity of components. In one embodiment, the immunogenic compositions according to the invention include an adjuvant containing combinations of lipopolysaccharide and Quillaja saponins that have been disclosed previously, for example in EP0671948. This patent demonstrated a strong synergy when a lipopolysaccharide (3D-MPL) was combined with a Quillaja saponin (QS21). The adjuvant may further comprise immunostimulatory oligonucleotides (for example, CpG) or a carrier. A particularly suitable saponin for use in the present invention is Quil A and its derivatives. Quil A is a saponin preparation isolated from the South American tree Quillaja Saponaria Molina and was first described by Dalsgaard et al. in 1974 (“Saponin adjuvants”, Archiv. für die gesamte Virusforschung, Vol. 44, Springer Verlag, Berlin, p243-254) to have adjuvant activity. Purified fragments of Quil A have been isolated by HPLC which retain adjuvant activity without the toxicity associated with Quil A (EP 0 362 278), for example QS7 and QS21 (also known as QA7 and QA21). QS21 is a natural saponin derived from the bark of Quillaja saponaria Molina, which induces CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), Th1 cells and a predominant IgG2a antibody response and is a preferred saponin in the context of the present invention. In a specific embodiment, QS21 is provided in its less reactogenic composition where it is quenched with an exogenous sterol, such as cholesterol for example. Several particular forms of less reactogenic compositions wherein QS21 is quenched with an exogenous cholesterol exist. In a specific embodiment, the saponin/sterol is in the form of a liposome structure (WO 96/33739, Example 1). In this embodiment the liposomes suitably contain a neutral lipid, for example phosphatidylcholine, which is suitably non-crystalline at room temperature, for example eggyolk phosphatidylcholine, dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) or dilauryl phosphatidylcholine. The liposomes may also contain a charged lipid which increases the stability of the lipsome-QS21 structure for liposomes composed of saturated lipids. In these cases the amount of charged lipid is suitably 1-20% w/w, preferably 5-10%. The ratio of sterol to phospholipid is 1-50% (mol/mol), suitably 20-25%. Suitable sterols include 3-sitosterol, stigmasterol, ergosterol, ergocalciferol and cholesterol. In one particular embodiment, the adjuvant composition comprises cholesterol as sterol. These sterols are well known in the art, for example cholesterol is disclosed in the Merck Index, 11th Edn., page 341, as a naturally occurring sterol found in animal fat. Where the active saponin fraction is QS21, the ratio of QS21: sterol will typically be in the order of 1:100 to 1:1 (w/w), suitably between 1:10 to 1:1 (w/w), and preferably 1:5 to 1:1 (w/w). Suitably excess sterol is present, the ratio of QS21:sterol being at least 1:2 (w/w). In one embodiment, the ratio of QS21:sterol is 1:5 (w/w). The sterol is suitably cholesterol. In one embodiment, the invention provides a dose of an immunogenic composition comprising immunologically active saponin, preferably QS21, at a level of 60 μg or less, for example between 1 and 60 μg. In one embodiment, the dose of the immunogenic composition comprises QS21 at a level of approximately around 50 μg, for example between 45 and 55 μg, suitably between 46-54 μg or between 47 and 53 μg or between 48 and 52 μg or between 49 and 51 μg, or 50 μg per dose. In another embodiment the dose of the immunogenic composition comprises QS21 at a level of around 25 μg, for example between 20-30 μg, suitably between 21-29 μg or between 22 and 28 μg or between 23 and 27 μg or between 24 and 26 μg, or 25 μg. In another embodiment, the dose of the immunogenic composition comprises QS21 at a level of around 10 μg per, for example between 5 and 15 μg, suitably between 6 and 14 μg, for example between 7 and 13 μg or between 8 and 12 μg or between 9 and 11 μg, or 10 μg. Specifically, a 0.5 ml vaccine dose volume contains 25 μg or 50 μg of QS21 per dose. Specifically, a 0.5 ml vaccine dose volume contains 50 μg of QS21 per dose. The lipopolysaccharide may be a non-toxic derivative of lipid A, particularly monophosphoryl lipid A or more particularly 3-Deacylated monophoshoryl lipid A (3D-MPL). 3D-MPL is sold under the name MPL by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals N.A. and is referred throughout the document as MPL or 3D-MPL. See, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,436,727; 4,877,611; 4,866,034 and 4,912,094. 3D-MPL primarily promotes CD4+ T cell responses with an IFN-□ (Th1) phenotype. 3D-MPL can be produced according to the methods disclosed in GB 2 220 211 A. Chemically it is a mixture of 3-deacylated monophosphoryl lipid A with 3, 4, 5 or 6 acylated chains. Preferably in the compositions of the present invention small particle 3D-MPL is used. Small particle 3D-MPL has a particle size such that it may be sterile-filtered through a 0.24 m filter. Such preparations are described in WO 94/21292. The invention therefore provides a dose of an immunogenic composition comprising lipopolysaccharide, preferably 3D-MPL, at a level of 75 μg or less, for example between 1 and 60 μg. In one embodiment the lipopolysaccharide is present at an amount of about 50 μg per dose. In one embodiment, the dose of the immunogenic composition comprises 3D-MPL at a level of around 50 μg, for example between 45-55 μg, suitably between 46-54 μg or between 47 and 53 μg or between 48 and 52 μg or between 49 and 51 μg, or 50 μg. In one embodiment, the dose of the immunogenic composition comprises 3D-MPL at a level of around 25 μg, for example between 20-30 μg, suitably between 21-29 μg or between 22 and 28 μg or between 23 and 27 μg or between 24 and 26 μg, or 25 μg. In another embodiment, the dose of the immunogenic composition comprises 3D-MPL at a level of around 10 μg, for example between 5 and 15 μg, suitably between 6 and 14 μg, for example between 7 and 13 μg or between 8 and 12 μg or between 9 and 11 μg, or 10 μg. In one embodiment, the volume of the dose is 0.5 ml. In a further embodiment, the immunogenic composition is in a volume suitable for a dose which volume is higher than 0.5 ml, for example 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 or 1 ml. In a further embodiment, the human dose is between 1 ml and 1.5 ml. Specifically, a 0.5 ml vaccine dose volume contains 25 μg or 50 μg of 3D-MPL per dose. Specifically, a 0.5 ml vaccine dose volume contains 50 μg of 3D-MPL per dose. The dose of the immunogenic composition according to any aspect of the invention suitably refers to human dose. By the term “human dose” is meant a dose which is in a volume suitable for human use. Generally this is between 0.3 and 1.5 ml. In one embodiment, a human dose is 0.5 ml. In a further embodiment, a human dose is higher than 0.5 ml, for example 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 or 1 ml. In a further embodiment, a human dose is between 1 ml and 1.5 ml. Suitable compositions of the invention are those wherein liposomes are initially prepared without MPL (as described in WO 96/33739), and MPL is then added, suitably as small particles of below 100 nm particles or particles that are susceptible to sterile filtration through a 0.22 μm membrane. The MPL is therefore not contained within the vesicle membrane (known as MPL out). Compositions where the MPL is contained within the vesicle membrane (known as MPL in) also form an aspect of the invention. The polypeptide comprising a C. difficile toxin A fragment and/or a C. difficile toxin B fragment can be contained within the vesicle membrane or contained outside the vesicle membrane. In a specific embodiment, QS21 and 3D-MPL are present in the same final concentration per dose of the immunogenic composition. In one aspect of this embodiment, a dose of immunogenic composition comprises a final level of 25 μg of 3D-MPL and 25 μg of QS21 or 50 μg of 3D-MPL and 50 μg of QS21. In one embodiment, the adjuvant includes an oil-in-water emulsion. For example, the oil-in-water emulsion can include an oil phase that incorporates a metabolisable oil, and an additional oil phase component, such as a tocol. The oil-in-water emulsion may also contain an aqueous component, such as a buffered saline solution (e.g., phosphate buffered saline). In addition, the oil-in-water emulsion typically contains an emulsifier. In one embodiment, the metabolizable oil is squalene. In one embodiment, the tocol is alpha-tocopherol. In one embodiment, the emulsifier is a nonionic surfactant emulsifier (such as polyoxyethethylene sorbitan monooleate, TWEEN80™). In exemplary embodiments, the oil-in-water emulsion contains squalene and alpha tocopherol in a ratio which is equal or less than 1 (w/w). The metabolisable oil in the oil-in-water emulsion may be present in an amount of 0.5-10 mg. The tocol in the oil-in-water emulsion may be present in an amount of 0.5-11 mg. The emulsifying agent in the oil-in-water emulsion may be present in an amount of 0.4-4 mg. In order for any oil in water composition to be suitable for human administration, the oil phase of the emulsion system has to comprise a metabolisable oil. The meaning of the term metabolisable oil is well known in the art. Metabolisable can be defined as ‘being capable of being transformed by metabolism’ (Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, W.B. Sanders Company, 25th edition (1974)). The oil may be any vegetable oil, fish oil, animal oil or synthetic oil, which is not toxic to the recipient and is capable of being transformed by metabolism. Nuts, seeds, and grains are common sources of vegetable oils. Synthetic oils are also part of this invention and can include commercially available oils such as NEOBEE® (caprylic/capric triglycerides made using glycerol from vegetable oil sources and medium-chain fatty acids (MCTs) from coconut or palm kernel oils) and others. A particularly suitable metabolisable oil is squalene. Squalene (2,6,10,15,19,23-Hexamethyl-2,6,10,14,18,22-tetracosahexaene) is an unsaturated oil which is found in large quantities in shark-liver oil, and in lower quantities in olive oil, wheat germ oil, rice bran oil, and yeast, and is a particularly preferred oil for use in this invention. Squalene is a metabolisable oil by virtue of the fact that it is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cholesterol (Merck index, 10th Edition, entry no. 8619). Suitably the metabolisable oil is present in the adjuvant composition in an amount of 0.5-10 mg, preferably 1-10, 2-10, 3-9, 4-8, 5-7, or 5-6 mg (e.g. 2-3, 5-6, or 9-10 mg), specifically about 5.35 mg or around 2.14 mg/dose. Tocols are well known in the art and are described in EP0382271. Suitably the tocol is alpha-tocopherol or a derivative thereof such as alpha-tocopherol succinate (also known as vitamin E succinate). Said tocol is suitably present in in an amount of 0.5-11 mg, preferably 1-11, 2-10, 3-9, 4-8, 5-7, 5-6 mg (e.g. 10-11, 5-6, 2.5-3.5 or 1-3 mg). In a specific embodiment the tocol is present in an amount of about 5.94 mg or around 2.38 mg per dose. The oil in water emulsion further comprises an emulsifying agent. The emulsifying agent may suitably be polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. In a particular embodiment the emulsifying agent may be Polysorbate® 80 (Polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate) or Tween® 80. Said emulsifying agent is suitably present in the adjuvant composition in an amount of 0.1-5, 0.2-5, 0.3-4, 0.4-3 or 2-3 mg (e.g. 0.4-1.2, 2-3 or 4-5 mg) emulsifying agent. In a specific embodiment the emulsifying agent is present in an amount of about 0.97 mg or about 2.425 mg. In one embodiment, the amounts of specific components present in the composition are the amounts present in a 0.5 ml human dose. In a further embodiment, the immunogenic composition is in a volume suitable for a human dose which volume is higher than 0.5 ml, for example 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 or 1 ml. In a further embodiment, the human dose is between 1 ml and 1.5 ml. Where the adjuvant is in a liquid form and is to be combined with a liquid form of a polypeptide composition, the adjuvant composition in a human dose will be a fraction of the intended final volume of the human dose, for example approximately half of the intended final volume of the human dose, for example a 350 μl volume for an intended human dose of 0.7 ml, or a 250 μl volume for an intended human dose of 0.5 ml. The adjuvant composition is diluted when combined with the polypeptide antigen composition to provide the final human dose of vaccine. The final volume of such dose will of course vary dependent on the initial volume of the adjuvant composition and the volume of polypeptide antigen composition added to the adjuvant composition. In an alternative embodiment, a liquid adjuvant is used to reconstitute a lyophilised polypeptide composition. In this embodiment, the human dose of the adjuvant composition is approximately equal to the final volume of the human dose. The liquid adjuvant composition is added to the vial containing the lyophilised polypeptide composition. The final human dose can vary between 0.5 and 1.5 ml. The method of producing oil-in-water emulsions is well known to the person skilled in the art. Commonly, the method comprises mixing the tocol-containing oil phase with a surfactant such as a PBS/polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate solution, followed by homogenisation using a homogenizer. It would be clear to a man skilled in the art that a method comprising passing the mixture twice through a syringe needle would be suitable for homogenising small volumes of liquid. Equally, the emulsification process in microfluidiser (M110S Microfluidics machine, maximum of 50 passes, for a period of 2 minutes at maximum pressure input of 6 bar (output pressure of about 850 bar)) could be adapted by the man skilled in the art to produce smaller or larger volumes of emulsion. The adaptation could be achieved by routine experimentation comprising the measurement of the resultant emulsion until a preparation was achieved with oil droplets of the required diameter. In an oil in water emulsion, the oil and emulsifier should be in an aqueous carrier. The aqueous carrier may be, for example, phosphate buffered saline. Preferably the oil-in-water emulsion systems of the present invention have a small oil droplet size in the sub-micron range. Suitably the droplet sizes will be in the range 120 to 750 nm, more preferably sizes from 120 to 600 nm in diameter. Most preferably the oil-in water emulsion contains oil droplets of which at least 70% by intensity are less than 500 nm in diameter, more preferably at least 80% by intensity are less than 300 nm in diameter, more preferably at least 90% by intensity are in the range of 120 to 200 nm in diameter. In one embodiment, the immunogenic composition is not 3 μg or 10 μg of any of SEQ ID Nos. 1 to 7 combined with an adjuvant comprising an oil in water emulsion having 0.125 mL SB62 emulsion (Total volume), 5.35 mg squalene, 5.94 mg DL-α-tocopherol and 2.425 mg polysorbate 80 per 0.5 ml dose. In one embodiment, the immunogenic composition is not 3 μg or 10 μg of any of SEQ ID Nos. 1 to 7 combined with an adjuvant comprising an oil in water emulsion 5.35 mg squalene, 5.94 mg DL-α-tocopherol and 2.425 mg polysorbate 80 per 0.5 ml dose. In one embodiment, the immunogenic composition does not contain an adjuvant comprising a oil in water emulsion having squalene, DL-α-tocopherol and polysorbate 80. Immunogenic Compositions and Vaccines In one embodiment the immunogenic composition further comprises additional antigens. In one embodiment the additional antigens are antigens derived from a bacterium selected from the group consisting of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae), Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Moraxella catarrhalis (M.cattarhalis), Clostridium tetani (C. tetani), Corynebacterium diptherieriae (C. diptherieriae), Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), enterococci, and Staphylococcus aureus (S.aureus). In a further embodiment the immunogenic composition of the invention may comprise further antigens from C.difficile for example the S-layer proteins (WO01/73030). Optionally the immunogenic composition further comprises a saccharide from C.difficile. There is further provided a vaccine comprising the immunogenic composition. This vaccine may further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a vaccine comprising the immunogenic composition of the invention and an adjuvant. The vaccine preparations containing immunogenic compositions of the present invention may be used to protect a mammal susceptible to C.difficile infection or treat a mammal with a C.difficile infection, by means of administering said vaccine via a systemic or mucosal route. These administrations may include injection via the intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intradermal or subcutaneous routes; or via mucosal administration to the oral/alimentary, respiratory, genitourinary tracts. Although the vaccine of the invention may be administered as a single dose, components thereof may also be co-administered together at the same time or at different times (for instance pneumococcal saccharide conjugates could be administered separately, at the same time or 1-2 weeks after the administration of the any bacterial protein component of the vaccine for coordination of the immune responses with respect to each other). In addition to a single route of administration, 2 different routes of administration may be used. For example, saccharides or saccharide conjugates may be administered intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID) and bacterial proteins may be administered intranasally (IN) or intradermally (ID). In addition, the vaccines of the invention may be administered IM for priming doses and IN for booster doses. The content of toxins in the vaccine will typically be in the range 1-250 μg, preferably 5-50 μg, most typically in the range 5-25 μg. Following an initial vaccination, subjects may receive one or several booster immunizations adequately spaced. Vaccine preparation is generally described in Vaccine Design (“The subunit and adjuvant approach” (eds Powell M. F. & Newman M. J.) (1995) Plenum Press New York). Encapsulation within liposomes is described by Fullerton, U.S. Pat. No. 4,235,877. In one aspect of the invention is provided a vaccine kit, comprising a vial containing an immunogenic composition of the invention, optionally in lyophilised form, and further comprising a vial containing an adjuvant as described herein. It is envisioned that in this aspect of the invention, the adjuvant will be used to reconstitute the lyophilised immunogenic composition. A further aspect of the invention is a method of preventing or treating C.difficile infection comprising administering to the subject an immunoprotective dose of the immunogenic composition or vaccine of the invention. In one embodiment there is provided a method of preventing or treating primary and/or recurrence episodes of C.difficile infection comprising administering to the subject an immunoprotective dose of the immunogenic composition or vaccine of the invention. In one embodiment the subject is selected from the group consisting of mouse, rabbit, guinea pig, monkey, non-human primate or human. In one embodiment the subject is a mouse.

Protocols Anti-ToxA and Anti-ToxB ELISA Response: Protocol for Examples 2 to 4, 7 and 8 ToxA or ToxB fragments (for the examples 2 and 4-ToxA (2121-2686) and ToxB (1968-2366) for the examples 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8-ToxA (2387-2706) and ToxB (1750-2360)) were coated at 2 μg/ml (for ToxA) or 1 μg/ml (for ToxB) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) on high-binding microtitre plates (Nunc MAXISORP™), overnight at 4° C. The plates were blocked with PBS+1% Bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at RT with agitation. Hamster or mice sera are prediluted 1/100 (for post dose I or II samples) or 1/500 (for post dose III samples) in PBS-BSA0.2%-TWEEN™ 0.05% and then, 2 further twofold dilutions were made in microplates and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. After washing, bound hamster or mouse antibody was detected using Jackson ImmunoLaboratories Inc. peroxidase-conjugated Anti-Mouse (ref: 110-035-003) or Anti-Hamster (ref: 107-035-142) diluted 1:5000 in PBS-BSA0.2%-tween 0.05% (′detection antibody′). The detection antibodies were incubated for 30 min at 20° C. with agitation. The color was developed using 4 mg 0-phenylenediamine (OPD)+5 μl H2O2 per 10 ml pH 4.5 0.1M citrate buffer for 15 minutes in the dark at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl HCl, and the optical density (OD) was read at 490 nm relative to 620 nm. The level of anti-ToxA or anti-ToxB antibodies present in each individual sera is determined by comparison to a reference serum (calibrated against Jackson Global IgG) added on each plate and expressed in μg/ml. A geometric mean titer GMT was calculated using Excel software for the samples in each treatment group for the hamster or mice immunizations. Example 1 Design of Five C.Difficile ToxA-ToxB Fusion Proteins Fusion proteins (also called ‘fusions’) containing fragments of the C-terminal repeating domains of ToxA and ToxB were designed. These fusion proteins contained a fragment of the C-terminal repeating domain of ToxA and a fragment of the C-terminal repeating domain of ToxB, and a junction between the C-terminal end of the ToxA fragment and the N terminal end of the ToxB fragment. Two strategies were devised, in the first strategy; the fusion was designed such that the long solenoid structure was maintained at the junction between the two fragments. In the second strategy, the two fragments of the fusions are separated by a linker to allow their independent correct folding. The C-terminal part of ToxA and ToxB is composed of repeated sequences: short repeats (SR) and long repeats (LR) (PNAS 2005 vol 102: 18373-18378). The partial known 3D structure for the C-terminal domain of ToxA has been described (PNAS 2005 Greco et al., vol 102: 18373-18378; Nature Structural & Molecular biology 2006 vol 13(5): 460-461; PDB codes: 2F6E, 2G7C and 2QJ6). The inventors predicted that there are two kinds of important interactions between residues of the C-terminal part of ToxA and ToxB. The first interaction occurs between residues contained in a LR and its preceding SR and is important to maintain the solenoid-like structure. The second type of interaction occurs between residues contained in a LR and the following SR and this interaction is mediating the carbohydrate-binding function of the toxin. A new “structural-functional” repeat SR-LR-SR was defined. The structure of this repeat was maintained intact in the designed fusions. The positions of the short (SR) and long repeats (LR) of ToxA and ToxB repeats are presented in Table 1. A list of the “SR-LR-SR” boxes contained in the C-terminal domain of ToxA and ToxB is presented in Table 2 below. Start End Name position position ToxA_1 1874 1944 ToxA_2 2008 2078 ToxA_3 2142 2212 ToxA_4 2254 2326 ToxA_5 2390 2460 ToxA_6 2503 2573 ToxA_7 2595 2664 ToxB_1 1877 1946 ToxB_2 2008 2078 ToxB_3 2140 2212 ToxB_4 2274 2343 Finally, the number of SRs between two LRs were maintained in the designed fusions to keep the long solenoid-like structure. Before the design of junctions for the fusions, two working hypotheses were defined: first hypothesis, the shorter the fusions, the better the probability for the fusions to be stably over expressed; second hypothesis, according to the concept of “SR-LR-SR” boxes, the start position has to be chosen in order to ensure a correct folding of the first SR of this previously defined SR-LR-SR box. Thus the fusions start at the beginning of the SR that precedes the SR-LR-SR box. Using these two hypotheses, three start positions were analysed: residue 2370, 2234 and 2121 of ToxA. The start position 2370 was excluded. The start position 2234 was also excluded because one of the residues involved in interactions important for the protein structural stability is not conserved. So, it was decided that all the designed fusion will begin at residue 2121 of ToxA. All fusions will end at the last residue of ToxB. Four fusions (F1-4) were designed in order to maintain the entire fusion in a long solenoid-like structure between the two fusion fragments. Fusions 1 (F1) and 2 (F2) were designed using the same hypothesis. All SR protein sequences of ToxA and ToxB had been compared using a multiple alignment software (ClustalW—Thompson J D et al. (1994) Nucleic Acids Res., 22, 4673-4680). The more similar sequences were the third SR VIII of ToxA and the third SR II of ToxB and third SR III of ToxB. In order to make a choice between these two SR of ToxB, a structural homology modelling (using the SwissModel interface—Arnold K et al. (2006) Bioinformatics, 22, 195-201) was performed on the C-terminal part of ToxB using the known 3D structure of partial ToxA C-terminal domain (PDB code: 2QJ6). Using the third SR VIII of ToxA, the best local structural superposition (performed using SwissPDBViewer—Guex N et al. (1997), Electrophoresis 18, 2714-2723) was obtained with the third SR II of ToxB. So, two junctions were designed: the first one is between the third SR VIII of ToxA and the fourth SR II of ToxB (F1) and the second one is between the second SR VIII of ToxA and the third SR II of ToxB (F2). To design fusion 3 (F3), a global structural superposition was performed between both the known structure of the partial C-terminal domain of ToxA and the predicted structure of C-terminal domain of ToxB (using SwissModel and SwissPDBViewer softwares). The best superposition was found between LR VII of ToxA and LR II of ToxB. So, it was decided to make a junction in this similar LR. The junction was performed firstly in a region where the sequence is conserved between ToxA and ToxB, after that in order to keep in the ToxA part of the fusion, the residues in interaction with the preceding SR and lastly, in order to keep in the ToxB part, the residues in interaction with the following SR. For the design of fusion 4 (F4), the C-terminal domain of ToxB was divided in 4 fragments and a more precise homology modelling (SwissModel) was performed on them. The split was realised in order to keep intact the “SR-LR-SR” boxes (each domain finishes at the end of the SR that follows a LR). A structural superposition between the predicted structures of these fragments and the known 3D structure of ToxA was made and the best structural surperposition was obtained for the third SR of ToxB (SR I) and the last SR of ToxA (third SR VIII). So, the junction was done between the second SR VIII of ToxA and the third SRlof ToxB. The last fusion (F5) was designed in order to allow an independent correct folding of the two fragments of the fusion. A linker was added between the last residue of the ToxA protein sequence and the beginning of the fourth SR II of ToxB (always taking into account the importance of an intact “SR-LR-SR” box). Only one exogenous residue (Glycine) was added as a linker and located between two existing Glycines. Thus, the linker can also be described as composed of 3 Glycines surrounding by known (for ToxA) and predicted (for ToxB) beta-strand.

For the anti-ToxA response, both MPL and QS21 have an added value even if the QS21 seems the most effective. For the anti-ToxB response, the effect of the MPL is less clear while the QS21 removal has a drastric effect on the IgG titers. Results for FIG. 2: Regarding the adjuvant comparison, the adjuvant A induced significant higher anti-ToxA and anti-ToxB antibodies compared to Alum, Adjuvant B or non adjuvanted formulations. Adjuvant B induced higher anti-ToxA and anti-ToxB antibodies compared to the non adjuvanted formulations.

Example 5 Immunisation of Mice with Tox A or Tox B Fragments and ToxA-ToxB Fusions FIGS. 9 to 12 Balb/C mice were immunized with the constructs described in example 1. Groups of 15 female Balb/c mice were immunized IM at days 0, 14 and 28 with 3 μg or 10 μg of the separate fragments of ToxA and ToxB (ToxA C-term (2387-2706) (0.6 μg)+C-terToxB (1750-2360) as well as with ToxA-ToxB fusions proteins adjuvanted with Adjuvant B. A control group of 10 mice was vaccinated with Adjuvant B alone. Anti-ToxA and anti-ToxB ELISA titers were determined in individual sera collected at day 42 (post III). Hemagglutination inhibition titers were determined in pooled Post III sera. Anti-ToxA and Anti-ToxB ELISA Response: Protocol Samples of the ToxA or ToxB fragments were coated at 1 μg/ml for ToxB fragments or 2 μg/ml for ToxA fragments in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) on high-binding microtitre plates (Nunc MAXISORP™), overnight at 4° C. The plates were blocked with PBS-BSA 1% for 30 min at RT with agitation. The mice anti-sera are prediluted 1/1000 in PBS-BSA0.2%-TWEEN™ 0.05%. and then, further twofold dilutions were made in microplates and incubated at RT for 30 min with agitation. After washing, bound murine antibody was detected using Jackson ImmunoLaboratories Inc. peroxidase-conjugated affiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (ref: 115-035-003) diluted 1:5000 in PBS-BSA0.2%-tween 0.05%. The detection antibodies were incubated for 30 min. at 20° C. with agitation. The color was developed using 4 mg 0-phenylenediamine (OPD)+5 μl H2O2 per 10 ml pH 4.5 0.1M citrate buffer for 15 minutes in the dark at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl HCl, and the optical density (OD) was read at 490 nm relative to 620 nm. The level of anti-ToxA or anti-ToxB antibodies present in the sera was expressed in mid-point titers by comparison with a reference serum. A GMT was calculated for the 15 samples in each treatment group (10 for the control group). Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay: Protocol 8 serial twofold dilutions of mice pooled antisera (25 μl) were performed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in 96-well U-bottom microplates. 25 μl of native Toxin A (0.2 μg/well) were then added and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. After incubation, 50 μl of purified rabbit erythrocytes diluted at 2% were added to each well. The plates were incubated at 37° C. for 2 hours. Plates were analysed visually, with hemagglutination presenting as diffuse red cells in the well and the inhibition of hemagglutination observed as a red point settled in the well. The inhibition titers were defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the serum inhibiting hemagglutination. Cytotoxicity Assay IMR90 fibroblast cells were cultured at 37° C. with 5% CO2, in Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium EMEM+10% fetal calf serum+1% glutamine+1% antibiotics (penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin) and were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 5.10 cells/well. After 24 h, 100 μl of the cell media was removed from the wells. 8 (for the experiment in example 5) or 12 (for the experiment in example 6) serial twofold dilutions of mice pooled antisera (50 μl) were performed in cell media. 50 μl of native Toxin B (0.5 ng/ml) is then added and the plates incubated at 37° C. with 5% CO2 for 24 hours. Cells were observed after 24 hours, and the proportion of rounded cells was determined. The inhibition titers were defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the serum inhibiting 50% cell rounding. Results: Anti-Tox A antibodies were induced after immunization with the ToxA fragment alone but also with each of the 5 fusions. The functional properties of these antibodies were tested in the hemagglutination assay. This assay is only adapted for Tox A evaluation as no hemagglutination is observed with ToxB. Haemaglutination inhibition was observed with the anti-Tox A fragment sera or sera directed against each of the ToxA-ToxB fusions. An ELISA using ToxB antibodies was also performed. Anti-Tox B antibodies were induced after immunization with the ToxB fragment alone but also with the F2, F3 and F4 fusions. Inhibition titers obtained using sera from mice immunised with the ToxB fragment or the ToxA-ToxB fusions were greater than that obtained using control sera. Example 6 Immunisation of Mice with Tox A-Tox B Fusions Groups of 25 female mice were immunized IM at days 0, 14 and 28 with 3 μg of the ToxA-ToxB fusion proteins formulated in Adjuvant B or 10 μg of a non-adjuvanted mix of ToxA(6 μg)+ToxB(4 μg). In addition to F2, four other fusion protein constructs were used, there were F54 Gly (SEQ ID NO:21), F54 New (SEQ ID NO:23), F5 ToxB (SEQ ID NO:25) and F52 New (SEQ ID NO:27). An ELISA was carried out using the anti-ToxA and anti-ToxB ELISA response:protocol described in example 5 except here the samples of the toxA or toxB fragments were coated at 1 μg/ml in phosphate buffered saline on high-binding microtitre plates. A hemagglutination inhibition assay was performed as described in example 5 except that the rabbit erythrocytes were diluted at 2.5%.

The final construct was generated by the transformation of E. coli strain BLR (DE3) with the recombinant expression vector according to standard method with CaCl2-treated cells (Hanahan D. <<Plasmid transformation by Simanis.>> In Glover, D. M. (Ed), DNA cloning. IRL Press London. (1985): p. 109-135.). Host Strain: BLR(DE3). BLR is a recA derivative of BL21. Strains having the designation (DE3) are lysogenic for a λ prophage that contains an IPTG inducible T7 RNA polymerase. λ DE3 lysogens are designed for protein expression from pET vectors This strain is also deficient in the Ion and ompT proteases. Genotype: E. coli BLR::DE3 strain, F− ompT hadSB(rB−mB−) gal dcm (DE3) Δ(srl-recA)306::Tn10 (TetR) Expression of the Recombinant Proteins: An E. coli transformant was stripped from agar plate and used to inoculate 200 ml of LBT broth ±1% (w/v) glucose+kanamycin (50 μg/ml) to obtain O.D.600 nm between 0.1-0.2. Cultures were incubated overnight at 37° C., 250 RPM. This overnight culture was diluted to 1:20 in 500 ml of LBT medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and grown at 37° C. at a stirring speed of 250 rpm until O.D.620 reached 0.5/0.6. At O.D.600 nm around 0.6, the culture was cooled down before inducing the expression of the recombinant protein by addition of 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG; EMD Chemicals Inc., catalogue number: 5815) and incubated overnight at 23° C., 250 RPM. After overnight induction (around 16 hours), O.D.600 nm was evaluated after induction and culture was centrifuged at 14 000 RPM for 15 minutes and pellets were frozen at −20° C. separately. Purification: The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 20 mM bicine buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 mM NaCl and a mixture of protease inhibitor (Complete, Roche). Bacteria were lysed using a French Press system 20 000 PSI. Soluble (supernatant) and insoluble (pellet) components were separated by centrifugation for example at 20 000 g for 30 min at 4° C. The 6-His tagged-protein was purified under native conditions on IMAC. The soluble components were loaded on a GE column (15 ml for example) (Ni loaded) preequilibrated with the same buffer used to bacterial resuspension. After loading on the column, the column was washed with the same buffer. Elution was performed using a 20 mM bicine buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 mM NaCl and different concentrations of imidazole (5-600 mM). After gel analysis, more pure fractions were selected, concentrated and loaded on SEC chromatography for further purification step. Fractions containing the fusion proteins were selected on the basis of purity by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against bicine buffer (20 mM Bicine, 150 mM NaCl, with or without 5 mM EDTA pH8.0), Protein concentration was determined using DC Protein Assay of BioRad. Proteins were thus pooled, sterile-filtered on 0.22 μm, stored at −80° C. Alternatively, IMAC purification was preceded by a DEAE purification step using 2 mM bicine buffer (pH 8.0) for loading and washing, and eluted using a gradient with the same buffer but with 1M NaCl added.

After the overnight induction (around 16 hours), O.D. at 600 nm was evaluated after induction and culture was centrifuged at 14 000 RPM for 15 minutes and pellets were frozen at −20° C. separately. Purification: The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 20 mM bicine buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 mM NaCl supplemented by a mixture of protease inhibitor (Complete without EDTA, Roche cat 11873580001) and benzonase. (Roche cat 1.01695.0001). Bacteria were lysed using a French Press system 2×20 000 PSI. Soluble (supernatant) and insoluble (pellet) components were separated by centrifugation at 34 000 g or 48 000 g for 25-30 min at 4° C. Supernatant was harvested and filtrated on 0.22 μm filter. The 6-His tagged-protein was purified under native conditions on IMAC. The soluble components were loaded on a GE column (for example 15 ml) (Ni loaded) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer used to bacterial resuspension. After loading, the column was washed with the same buffer. For ToxA: Elution was performed using a 20 mM bicine buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 mM NaCl and different concentrations of imidazole (5-100 mM). After gel analysis, more pure fractions were selected, concentrated and loaded on SEC chromatography (SUPERDEX™ 75) for further purification step in the same buffer without imidazole. For ToxB: A second wash was performed with 20 mM bicine buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 mM NaCl and 0.5% deoxycholate or same buffer with 150 mM NaCl. Elution was performed using a 20 mM bicine buffer (pH 8.0) containing 500 mM NaCl and different concentrations of imidazole (10-500 mM). After gel analysis, more pure fractions were selected, supplemented with 5 mM EDTA and loaded on SEC chromatography (SUPERDEX™ 200) for further purification step in same buffer with 5 mM EDTA. Fractions containing ToxA or ToxB fragments were selected on the basis of purity by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed against bicine buffer (20 mM Bicine, 150 mM NaCl, pH8.0), protein concentration was determined using RCDC Protein Assay of BioRad. Proteins were thus pooled, sterile-filtered on 0.22 μm, stored at −80° C. Example 11 Molecular Weight Evaluation of the Five C.Difficile ToxA-ToxB Fusions Analytical ultracentrifugation is used to determine the homogeneity and size distribution in solution of the different species within a protein sample by measuring the rate at which molecules move in response to a centrifugal force. This is based on the calculation of the coefficients of sedimentation of the different species that are obtained by sedimentation velocity experiment, which depend on their molecular shape and mass. 1. Protein samples are spun in a Beckman-Coulter PROTEOMELAB™ XL-1 analytical ultracentrifuge at 42 000 RPM after the AN-60Ti rotor had been equilibrated to 15° C. a. F1 fusion protein, 500 μg/ml, 20 mM Bicine, 150 mM NaCl, pH8.0b. F2 fusion protein, 500 μg/ml, 20 mM Bicine, 150 mM NaCl, pH8.0c. F3 fusion protein, 500 μg/ml, 20 mM Bicine, 150 mM NaCl, pH8.0d. F4 fusion protein, 500 μg/ml, 20 mM Bicine, 150 mM NaCl, pH8.0e. F5 fusion protein, 500 μg/ml, 20 mM Bicine, 150 mM NaCl, pH8.0 2. For data collection, 160 scans were recorded at 280 nm every 5 minutes. 3. Data analysis was performed using the program SEDFIT for determination of the C(S) distribution. Determination of the partial specific volume of the proteins was performed with the SEDNTERP software from their amino acid sequence. SEDNTERP was also used to determine the viscosity and the density of the buffer. 4. The molecular weight of the different species was determined from the C(S) distribution plot (concentration vs sedimentation coefficient), considering that it's a better representation of the raw data than the C(M) distribution (concentration vs molecular weight) to characterize the size distribution of a mixture. The molecular weight of the major species detected from the C(S) distribution of all five ToxA-ToxB fusion proteins corresponds to their monomeric form. The best fit frictional ratios determined for the five fusions are all between 2 and 2.2. This may indicate that the proteins are present in solution as an elongated form, which would be consistent with the protein structure. Example 12 Evaluation of Secondary and Tertiary Structures of C.Difficile ToxA-ToxB Fusions by Circular Dichroism and Fluorescence Spectroscopy Circular dichroism is used to determine the secondary structure composition of a protein by measuring the difference in the absorption of left-handed polarized light versus right-handed polarized light which is due to structural asymmetry. The shape and the magnitude of the CD spectra in the far-UV region (190-250 nm) are different whether a protein exhibits a beta-sheet, alpha-helix or random coil structure. The relative abundance of each secondary structure type in a given protein sample can be calculated by comparison to reference spectra. The tertiary structure of a protein sample can be assessed by the evaluation of the immobilisation of the aromatic amino acids. The observation of a CD signal in the near-UV region (250-50 nm) may be attributable to the polarization of phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophane residues and is a good indication that the protein is folded into a well defined structure. The following protocol was used: 1. Far UV spectra are measured using an optical path of 0.01 cm from 178 to 250 nm, with a 1 nm resolution and bandwidth on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Temperature of the cell is maintained at 23° C. by a Peltier thermostated RTE-111 cell block. A nitrogen flow of 10 L/min is maintained during the measurements. 2. Near-UV spectra are measured using an optical path of 0.01 cm from 250 to 300 nm, with a 1 nm resolution and bandwidth on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Temperature of the cell is maintained at 23° C. by a Peltier thermostated RTE-111 cell block. A nitrogen flow of 6 L/min is maintained during the measurements. The observation of the far-UV spectra (FIG. 22) for all five ToxA-ToxB fusion proteins suggests a weak content of alpha helix structures and a high content of beta sheet structures. Also, all proteins exhibited a maximum at 230 nm, which is unusual for soluble globular proteins. This particularity has been well characterized in the literature and is associated with a small group of proteins known for their absence of alpha helix and their high content in beta sheet and aromatic amino acids (Zsila, Analytical Biochemistry, 391(2009) 154-156). Those particularities are coherent with the structure that is expected for the ToxA-ToxB fusion proteins. Crystal structures of 13 proteins exhibiting the characteristic CD spectra with a positive signal at 230 nm were compared (Protein Data Bank). The average secondary structure content of those proteins is 42% beta sheet ±9% and 7% alpha helix ±6%. This strongly indicates that the spectral signature of the ToxA-ToxB fusion proteins is diagnostic of a high beta sheet and low alpha helix containing protein. The observation of the shape of the near-UV spectra (FIG. 23) for all five fusion proteins indicates that at least some of the aromatic amino acids are immobilised, which is a strong indication of a compact and specific tertiary structure. Moreover, the treatment of the protein with a denaturing concentration of urea caused the disappearance of the near-UV signal, which is an additional indication that this characteristic spectra was due to protein folding. Example 13 Design, Cloning, Expression and Purification of 4 Further Fusion Proteins Four further fusion proteins were designed using the design principles described in example 1, these were named F54 Gly (SEQ ID NO:21), F54 New (SEQ ID NO:23), F5 ToxB (SEQ ID NO:25) and F52 New (SEQ ID NO:27). These fusion proteins were expressed according to the procedure described in example 9. Example 14 Molecular weight evaluation of the C.difficile ToxA-ToxB fusions described in SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:25, and SEQ ID NO: 27 The molecular weight of the fusions described in SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:25, and SEQ ID NO:27 were determined as described in example 11. The molecular weight of the main species determined from the C(S) distribution of all four protein fusions described in SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:25, and SEQ ID NO:27 corresponds to their monomeric form and all proteins exhibit sedimentation properties similar to F1 to F5 fusions. Example 15 Evaluation of secondary and tertiary structures of C.difficile ToxA-ToxB fusions described in SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:1525 and SEQ ID NO:27 The secondary and tertiary structures of the fusions described in SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:25, and SEQ ID NO:27 were assessed according to the method described in example 5. The far UV CD for these fusion proteins can be found in FIG. 24, and the near UV spectra for these fusions can be found in FIG. 25. Analysis of the near and far UV CD spectra of the proteins described in SEQ ID NO:21, SEQ ID NO:23, SEQ ID NO:25, and SEQ ID NO:27 shows that all four have the same high beta sheet structure than F1 to F5 fusions. In addition, observation of the near UV spectra show no significant difference in the position of the aromatic amino acids in the tertiary structure compared to F1 to F5 fusions.
