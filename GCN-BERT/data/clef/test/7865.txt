RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is the U.S. national phase of international patent application number PCT/IB2013/002133, filed Sep. 26, 2013, which claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application No. 61/705,721, filed Sep. 26, 2012 The contents of both applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety and for all purposes. FIELD The present application generally relates to electrosurgical instruments having opposing jaws for cutting and sealing tissue, and more specifically to electrosurgical instruments with jaws having improved stiffness and compressive strength, and an improved articulation mechanism. BACKGROUND Biopolar electrosurgical instruments apply radiofrequency (RF) energy to a surgical site to cut, ablate, or coagulate tissue. A particular application of these electrosurgical effects is to seal blood vessels or tissue sheets. A typical instrument takes the form of a pair of opposing jaws or forceps, with one or more electrodes on each jaw tip. In an electrosurgical procedure, the electrodes are placed in close proximity to each other as the jaws are closed on a target site such that the path of alternating current between the two electrodes passes through tissue within the target site. The mechanical force exerted by the jaws and the electrical current combine to create the desired surgical effect. By controlling the level of mechanical and electrical parameters, such as the pressure applied by the jaws, the gap distance between electrodes, and the voltage, current, frequency, and duration of the electrosurgical energy applied to the tissue, the surgeon can coagulate, cauterize, or seal tissue toward a therapeutic end. Electrosurgical procedures can be performed in an open environment, through conventional incisions, or using laparoscopic procedures. In laparoscopic procedures, the electrosurgical instrument must be able to fit through a cannula or trocar having a very small inner diameter that is typically between 5 mm and 10 mm. It is possible to make an electrosurgical instrument small enough to meet this size requirement. Nevertheless, the push to make instruments smaller often competes against other equally important design criteria. The compression force exerted by the instrument is one of the most important design criteria that competes with instrument size. Ordinarily, a high compression force between the jaws is needed to form a proper seal within a reasonably short amount of time. Without sufficient compression force, the instrument may not be able to form a proper seal, or may form a proper seal only after a long time. It can be very difficult to create sufficient compression force with a smaller electrosurgical instrument because as the size of the instrument decreases, the percentage of space taken up by non-structural elements in the jaws increases. For example, the components that control tissue cutting, jaw actuation, articulation and power delivery all take up space in the jaws. Each component requires the removal of material from the jaws to provide space for the component. This reduces material mass and stiffness in the jaws, thereby reducing the compression force that can be created. Based on the foregoing, there is a need for improved electrosurgical devices that can be reduced in size without sacrificing important parameters like compressive strength.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Applicants have developed improved electrosurgical devices that address the need for reduced size, while also addressing the need for high compression force between the jaws. The improved electrosurgical devices were designed using a holistic approach that eliminates, simplifies, or combines individual components where appropriate, while maximizing strength and stiffness in the jaws. The following examples illustrate features that are designed to address the competing needs for reduced size and for stronger stiffer jaws. Although different features will be described and shown on an electrosurgical device 100, many of the features are independent features. Some or all of these features can appear on the same device, but need not be on the same device, and can be used in different combinations on different embodiments of the invention. Devices in accordance with the invention may include many of the device features and characteristics shown and described in U.S. application Ser. Nos. 12/027,231 and 13/070,391, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Pivot Connection Referring to FIG. 1, an electrosurgical device 100 is shown in accordance with one exemplary embodiment. Device 100 includes an elongated shaft 102. Elongated shaft 102 has a distal end portion 110 that features an upper jaw 120 and a lower jaw housing 130. Lower jaw housing 130 contains a lower jaw 132. A cutting blade 160, shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, is displaceable between the upper and lower jaws 120 and 132 to cut tissue. Upper jaw 120 and lower jaw housing 130 are pivotally joined by a pivot connection 140 that allows the upper jaw to pivot relative to the lower jaw housing to open and close the upper jaw. Pivot connection 140 includes a semi-cylindrical element 142 having a convex surface 143 that engages a first side 122 of upper jaw 120. Pivot connection 140 also includes an arc-shaped concave surface 144 that engages a second side 124 of upper jaw 120. Convex surface 143 and concave surface 144 follow circular profiles that are concentric about a pivot point 148. Semi-cylindrical element 142 and concave surface 144 are separated from one another by an arcuate passage 145. The edges of arcuate passage 145 form a track or chute 146 through which the upper jaw 120 slides. The arcuate shape of track 146 causes the upper jaw 120 to pivot relative to lower jaw housing 130 as the upper jaw slides through the passage. Upper jaw 120 pivots about pivot point 148. As can be seen in FIGS. 1 and 3, pivot connection 140 differs from conventional pin connections in significant ways. As an initial matter, pivot connection 140 does not require the removal of material from the jaws. Upper jaw 120 fits into the body of lower jaw housing 130 through arcuate passage 145, with little or no void space in or around the upper jaw and lower jaw housing. Conventional pin connections, in contrast, require the removal of material to accommodate the pin and to allow each jaw to pivot relative to one another. Removal of material from the jaws reduces the mass of the jaws, and consequently, the amount of stiffness and compression force that can be exerted on tissue when the jaws are closed. Pivot connection 140 also differs from conventional pin connections with regard to the position of the pivot connection relative to the jaws. Pin connections are typically located along the midline of the instrument between the upper and lower jaws. Pivot point 148, in contrast, is offset from a center line 101 of the device, adjacent to the outside edge 121 of upper jaw 120. This offset arrangement has an advantage over cross pin connections located on the midline because it provides a clear unobstructed path through the midline. The unobstructed path allows cutting blade 160 to travel along the midline between the blades, without any obstruction created by a pin. Electrode Configuration The electrode configuration in device 100 is another feature that balances the need for reduced size and increased jaw stiffness. Many known electrosurgical devices use one or more stand-alone electrodes placed on the jaws. Stand-alone electrodes require space to capture, isolate and house the electrodes in the jaws, sacrificing stiffness in the jaws. To address this problem, device 100 is designed without stand-alone electrodes. Power is is delivered directly to upper jaw 120 and lower jaw housing 130. Power Delivery Known electrosurgical devices deliver power to electrodes using dedicated power transmission wires that extend through the jaws. In many cases, these dedicated power transmission wires are in the form of stationary braided or jacketed wires. Dedicated power transmission wires occupy a significant amount of space and require throughbores, passages, etc. that remove material from the jaws. As such, dedicated power transmission wires and their throughbores decrease jaw stiffness, thereby reducing the amount of compressive force that can be applied between the jaws during sealing. Dedicated power transmission wires can also limit movement of the instrument in cases where the dedicated wires do not have sufficient slack or elasticity to move or stretch as the instrument moves. To preserve stiffness in the jaws and provide greater instrument mobility and flexibility, devices in accordance with the invention preferably include multifunctional components that control both motion and power delivery. Dedicated power transmission wires that sacrifice jaw stiffness and instrument mobility are preferably avoided. Energy delivery can be provided through the same components that control actuation and/or articulation, for example. Energy delivery can also be provided through translating components. Referring to FIG. 2, a cross section of device 100 is shown at the “wrist” or “vertebra” section 170. Wrist section 170, which is described in more detail in a later section, includes a vertebra 173 that is substantially solid, with the exception of four through-passages. Two through passages accommodate a looped articulation wire 167, and one through passage accommodates a looped actuation wire 169. Articulation wire 167 is operable to allow distal end portion of the device to bend relative to the longitudinal axis of the device. Actuation wire 169 is operable to open and close upper jaw 120. Articulation wire 167 is looped through the passages, forming two generally parallel articulation wire sections 172 and 174. Similarly, actuation wire 169 is looped through the passages, forming two generally parallel actuation wire sections 176 and 178. Actuation wire sections 176 and 178 cross over one another at the section shown in FIG. 2, as will be explained in more detail. FIGS. 3 and 14 show how articulation wire 167 and actuation wire 169 are routed through a distal end portion of the device, with a looped end of the articulation wire visible. A first through-passage 173a located in an outer peripheral section of vertebra 173 contains the first articulation wire section 172. A second through-passage 173b located in another outer peripheral section of vertebra 173 contains the second articulation wire section 174. A third through-passage 173c located in an interior section of vertebra 173 contains cutting blade 160. A fourth through-passage 173d located in an interior section of vertebra 173 contains actuation wire sections 176 and 178. Power is delivered to upper jaw 120 through actuation wire 169. Power is delivered to the lower jaw housing 130 through articulation wire 167, and may also be delivered through any other series of metal components, including jaw bushings, vertebra or shafts that may be metal and that contact each other in series, and which are isolated from actuation wire 169. Lower jaw housing 130 and lower jaw 132 both include metal surfaces in contact with one another, so that power delivered to the lower jaw housing is conducted to the lower jaw. Isolation Surfaces on upper jaw 120 that interface with lower jaw housing 130 and lower jaw 132 must be electrically isolated. To address this, device 100 includes a plastic skin 180 over upper jaw 120. Upper jaw 120 is over-molded with the plastic skin 180 to isolate the surfaces that interface with lower jaw housing 130. The over-mold does not require clearance between components, preserving space to allow the jaws to have more material mass. Over-molding upper jaw 120 also allows offsetting features to be created on the upper jaw, as will be explained in the next section. Gap Generating Offset Features The over-molded skin 180 has multiple functions. A first function of the over-molded skin is to electrically isolate upper jaw 120 from lower jaw housing 130, as described above. A second function of the over-molded skin is to generate offsetting features that create a gap space between the electrodes, i.e. upper jaw 120 and lower jaw 132, when the jaws are closed. In FIG. 4, an embodiment of the device includes offsetting features shown in the form of straps 150 that extend transversely across upper jaw 120. Straps 150 are produced during the over-mold process. A third function of the over-molded skin is to reduce the temperature of the back side of the jaw that comes into contact with the tissue, so as to reduce the risk of tissue burning. Gap generating offset features in accordance with the invention need not take the form of transverse straps, and can be any surface irregularity or projection that provides a separation between electrodes when the jaws are closed. For example, upper jaw 120 may include a plurality of holes that receive rivets or rivet-like members that project from the surface of the upper jaw and contact lower jaw 132. Pin-Less Lower Jaw The lower jaw 132 is pivotally connected to lower jaw housing 130 by a lower jaw pivot connection 190. Pivot connection 190 between lower jaw 132 and lower jaw housing 130 represents one of the most critical areas where stiffness and strength must be maximized in the lower jaw to provide sufficient compression force. Pin connections and throughbores require removal of material from the lower jaw, reducing jaw stiffness and strength, as described above. Therefore, pivot connection 190 features a “pin-less” connection in the form of a pair of bosses 136. Bosses 136 project outwardly from lower jaw 132 and snap into small apertures 138 in lower jaw housing 130. With this arrangement, no material is removed from lower jaw 132 across the width of the jaw at the location of pivot connection 190. As an alternative to bosses and apertures, lower jaw housing 130 can be lightly crimped to create a pivoting interface between the lower jaw housing and lower jaw 132. Referring to FIG. 5, jaw 132 has a rounded convex bottom surface 133, and lower jaw housing 130 has a rounded concave inside surface 131. Concave inside surface 131 bears against convex bottom surface 133 when lower jaw housing 130 is pivoted relative to upper jaw 120. As such, concave inside surface 131 and convex bottom surface 133 form bearing surfaces that absorb compression force between lower jaw 132 and lower jaw housing 130 and direct the compression force away from the bosses 136 and apertures 138. Consequently, the structural integrity of lower jaw 132 does not depend greatly on the strength of bosses 136 or pivot connection 190. Actuation Wire One of the challenges of an articulating device is transmitting motion through the articulating members. When the device bends, the arc length through the joint changes as you move away from centerline. This generally requires the use of tall (for strength) and thin (for flexibility) actuation members which move along the centerline of the device. Articulation left and right prevents the use of short and flat actuation members or paired wire members arranged perpendicular to the articulation plane, because the members or wires will buckle and/or transmit motion and force unequally. Device 100 uses an actuation wire 169 that is looped to form a pair of parallel wire sections 176 and 178, as noted above. Actuation wire sections 176 and 178 are configured to pivot the upper jaw 120 relative to lower jaw housing 130 when force is applied through the actuation wire sections. Looped actuation wire 169 is connected to a pin (not shown) in upper jaw 120. To pivot upper jaw 120 to an open position, a pushing force (or force directed toward distal end portion 110) is applied to the upper jaw through actuation wire sections 176 and 178. To pivot upper jaw 120 to a closed position, a pulling force (or tension force directed away from the distal end portion 110) is applied to the upper jaw through actuation wire sections 176 and 178. Each of the actuation wire sections 176 and 178 is set out from the centerline of the articulation plane, but in an arrangement that allows the wires to push or pull equally left to right. The solution is to twist the wires 180 degrees, crossing in the middle of the articulation members at a cross-over point P. FIG. 2 is a cross section view of device 100 taken through a plane that intersects the cross-over point P, where actuation wire section 176 crosses over actuation wire section 178. FIG. 14 is a perspective view of the distal end of device 100, with components removed to show how wire section 176 crosses over wire section 178 at point P. FIG. 15 is a cross section view of device 100 that shows how actuation wire 169 connects with upper jaw 120. Actuation wire 169 is looped through a U-shaped slot 125 formed in a base portion of upper jaw 120. FIGS. 16 and 17 are cross section views of device 100 that show how actuation wires 176 and 178 connect with the proximal end of the device. The cross-over of actuation wires 176 and 178 results in arc lengths through the articulation region that are mirror images of each-other and remain the same length. The arc lengths are illustrated schematically in FIG. 7. The crossover point P acts like a pivot point for the wires. By maintaining equal arc lengths, the forces are balanced between the actuation wire sections 176 and 178, even when the actuation wire sections are bent during articulation of the jaws, so that the wire sections pull evenly on the upper jaw and pose minimal resistance to the articulation wires 172 and 174. Articulation wire sections 172 and 174 are maintained in a state of tension so that the components of the system are kept together in tension, allowing the jaws to open and close properly and to allow the distal end of the device to articulate properly. Jaw Contour Referring to FIG. 8, upper jaw 120 has a mating surface 131 that mates with lower jaw 132. Lower jaw 132 similarly has a mating surface 133 that mates with upper jaw 120. Mating surfaces 131 and 133 each have a V-shaped contour as shown that provides several advantages over planar mating surfaces. The V-shaped contour provides a self-alignment feature that keeps upper jaw 120 and lower jaw 132 aligned with one another. The self-alignment feature eliminates the need for long component lengths and tight tolerance geometry behind the jaws to control alignment. The V-shaped mating surfaces 131 and 133 also have larger surface areas than planar surfaces, resulting an incrementally wider area to engage tissue. The axial center line 123 of mating surface 131 meets the axial center line 135 of mating surface 133 along a line 137 that is offset from a center line 101 of the device 100. In this arrangement, the cutting plane 103 can be moved away from center line 101 of device 100, allowing cutting blade 160 to be located away from the center so that other components can be positioned toward the center of the device. Lower Jaw Spring Referring back to FIG. 1, lower jaw housing 130 contains a lower jaw spring 134 between the lower jaw housing and lower jaw 132. Lower jaw spring 134 bears against the inside of lower jaw housing 130 to pivot lower jaw 132. In this configuration, lower jaw spring 134 biases a distal portion 137 of lower jaw 132 towards upper jaw 120. Known electrosurgical devices that include lower jaw springs place the spring at a proximal section of the lower jaw, at a point located proximally with respect to the pivot point. To provide room for the spring, a certain amount of material is removed from the proximal portion of the lower jaw, and/or from the lower jaw housing in a similar area. This removal of material can create a substantial decrease in strength and stiffness at the proximal section of the lower jaw and/or lower jaw housing. Jaw strength and stiffness are especially important at the proximal section of the lower jaw and jaw housing because the proximal section is a critical area for providing compressive force. FIG. 1 shows the relative thickness of the lower jaw 132 at its proximal section 135 and its distal section 137. To avoid losing jaw strength and stiffness at the proximal portion 135 of lower jaw 132, lower jaw spring 134 is located at distal portion 137 of the lower jaw. This preserves more mass around proximal section 135 where it is needed. Distal section 137 of lower jaw 132 has more mass to begin with than proximal section 135, and is therefore more suited for accommodating lower jaw spring 134. Lower jaw spring 134 frictionally engages lower jaw 132 in two places, 132a and 132b. This engagement at two locations assists in transferring energy from lower jaw housing 130 to lower jaw 132. Articulation Mechanism FIGS. 9-12 show an articulation mechanism 200 in accordance with the invention. Articulation mechanism 200 controls bending or turning motion at wrist section 170, which permits the upper jaw 120 and lower jaw 132 to bend left or right. More specifically, articulation mechanism 200 is operable to apply a tension force to one of the articulation wire sections 172 and 174 to bend the device at wrist section 170. Articulation mechanism 200 includes a pair of indexing disks 210 that hold the articulated position of the upper and lower jaws 120 and 132. Articulator mechanism 200 also includes an articulator 220 operable to rotate the indexing disks 210. Articulator 220 has a pair of handles 222 that extend outwardly from the indexing disks. Handles 222 and indexing disks 210 are rotatably displaceable in a housing 230. Housing 230 has an interior wall 232 lined with ratchet notches 234. Each indexing disk 210 has a pair of indexing arms 212 operable to engage and disengage ratchet notches 234 when the indexing disk is rotated in housing 230. Ratchet notches 234 are separated from one another by a series of inwardly pointing ratchet teeth 235. Each indexing arm 212 has a distal end 213 with a pointed tip 215 configured to slidably interact and engage with ratchet notches 234 and ratchet teeth 235 as indexing disks 210 rotate in the housing. Indexing arms 212 are formed of resilient flexible material that allows the indexing arms to flex or bend radially inwardly toward the center of indexing disks 210 in response to contact between tip 215 and indexing teeth 235. When tips 215 engage the inner most sections of ratchet teeth 235, indexing arms 212 bend inwardly under stored energy. As indexing disks 210 rotate and the tips 215 align with ratchet notches 234, indexing arms 212 snap outwardly and return to a relaxed state with the tips positioned in the ratchet notches. Articulation mechanism 200 includes a centering mechanism 240 that biases articulator 220 to a centered or “neutral” condition. The neutral condition is shown in FIG. 9. Centering mechanism 240 includes a pair of flexible leaf springs 216 that extend from each indexing disk 210. Each leaf spring 216 has a distal end 217 that is held in a captive position between a pair of projections 226 on articulator 220. When articulator 220 is in the neutral condition, each leaf spring 216 is substantially straight, in a relaxed state. When articulator 220 begins to rotate left or right, projections 226 also rotate, but the indexing disks 210 do not rotate immediately, and instead remain stationary, as will be explained in more detail below. As such, each leaf spring 216 bends in response to initial movement of the projections 226, storing energy in the leaf spring that creates a biasing force. The biasing force in each leaf spring 216 applies force to articulator 220 in the direction opposite of the direction in which the articulator was rotated, to urge the articulator back toward the neutral condition. When rotation force is released from articulator 200, the biasing force in leaf springs 216 returns articulator 200 back to the neutral condition. Articulation mechanism 200 further includes an automatic locking mechanism 250. Locking mechanism 250 is a passive interlock mechanism that prevents external force on the upper and lower jaws 120 and 132 from moving the jaws out of their indexed position. Locking mechanism 250 includes four detents 228 on articulator 220, two of which are visible in the Figures, and two which are on the opposite side of the articulator. Each detent 228 is movable with respect to indexing disks 210 between a locking position and a release position. In the locking position, shown in FIG. 9, each detent 228 is aligned with an inner projection 219 on one of the indexing arms 212. In this position, inner projections 219 block the indexing arms and prevent them from bending inwardly, thereby preventing the indexing arms from disengaging the ratchet notches and precluding articulation of the jaws from their indexed position. In the release position, shown in FIG. 10, each detent 228 is rotated out of alignment with the corresponding inner projection 219, allowing the indexing arms to bend inwardly and disengage the ratchet notches to facilitate articulation of the jaws to another position. In this arrangement, articulation mechanism 200 is a floating mechanism that is biased toward the neutral condition with respect to the indexing disks. In operation, the jaws are articulated by rotating articulator 220 either clockwise or counterclockwise relative to housing 230 via the handles 222. When rotation force is initially applied to handles 222, the applied force is opposed by the centering forces of leaf springs 216. If the applied force is greater than the centering forces, articulator 220 will rotate relative to indexing disks 210 so that the detents 228 move out of the locking position to the release position. Articulator 220 has four abutment edges 225, and indexing disks 210 have corresponding abutment edges 211. When articulator is in the neutral condition, abutment edges 211 are spaced apart from abutment edges 225, creating small gaps 229 that define limits of travel. Upon initial rotation of handles 222, articulator 220 will rotate, and two of the abutment edges 225 will approach corresponding abutment edges 211 on indexing disks 210. After handles 222 are rotated through a small threshold angle of rotation, such as 5 degrees, the abutment edges 225 approaching the abutment edges 211 on indexing disks 210 will reach their limit of travel and contact the indexing disks 210. At this point, rotational force applied to the handles will be transferred to indexing disks 210 and rotate the indexing disks in tandem with articulator 220. As indexing disks 210 rotate, the tips 215 of indexing arms 212 bend inwardly as they slidably engage ratchet teeth 235 and snap outwardly as they align with ratchet notches 234 in the next indexed position. Upon reaching a desired indexed position, rotation force is released from handles 222, so that leaf springs 216 return articulator 220 to the neutral condition, with detents 228 returned to the locking position. In the locking position, detents 228 prevent indexing arms 212 from disengaging ratchet notches 234, effectively locking articulation wires 172 and 174 and wrist 170 in the indexed position. Referring to FIGS. 11 and 12, device 100 includes a spring plate 260 which is attached to proximal ends of articulation wires 172 and 174. Spring plate 260 places articulation wires 172 and 174 in tension to secure components in wrist 170 together, thereby avoiding the need to use other means to physically join the wrist components. Indexing disks 210 hold spring plate 260 in place in housing 230. Each articulation wire 172 and 174 extends through a hole in a wing portion 262 of spring plate 260. The proximal end of each articulation wire 172 and 174 is bent and captured in a wire stopper 270. Each wire stopper 270 is keyed to maintain its orientation against spring plate 260. Each wing portion 262 has a relaxed state in which the wing portion is bent in a proximal direction with respect to the rest of the spring plate 260. In the assembled state, the wire stoppers 270 are pulled distally against wing portions 262 to tension the articulation mechanism 200. Wrist Mechanism Embodiments may include a wrist mechanism with components having “non-circular” pivot interfaces. For example, the pivot interfaces between components may have parabolic, stepped or V-notched geometries, resulting in a moving axis of rotation rather than a traditional fixed axis of rotation associated with strictly “circular” geometries, such as spherical or cylindrical interfacing geometries. The moving axis of rotation provides the benefit of a self-straightening or self-centering coupling in which the adjoined vertebrae are urged to return to a straight configuration after being articulated. This bias toward a straightened configuration stabilizes the position of the jaws and provides resistance against jogging when the jaws are locked or contacting other objects. The non-circular interface also combats the loss of compression force exhibited by the jaws when the jaws are articulated by lengthening the effective shaft length. In devices which have a “pull” type mechanism to close the jaws, lengthening the shaft (without changes in the jaw locking mechanism) will result in pulling harder for more compression force. FIG. 13 shows one example of a non-circular interface 171 between vertebra 173 and a bushing 182 in wrist section 170. Non-circular interface 171 includes a rounded convex mating surface 175 on vertebra 173, and a rounded concave mating surface 184 on bushing 182. A step or “lobe” 177 extends outwardly from convex mating surface 175. The surface transitions between lobe 177 and convex mating surface 175 are rounded, forming a smooth compound curvature along the edge of vertebra 173. A recess 185 extends into concave mating surface 184 and has a shape that conforms to the geometry of lobe 177 as shown. When wrist section 170 is straight (i.e. when the vertebrae are not articulated and the jaws are straight), convex mating surface 175 and lobe 177 are in phase with concave mating surface 184 and recess 185, with the lobe nested in the recess. When wrist section 170 is articulated, convex mating surface 175 and lobe 177 are shifted out of phase with concave mating surface 184 and recess 185, such that the lobe moves out of the recess and engages the concave mating surface. In this condition, the distance between vertebra 173 and bushing 182 is incrementally increased, shifting the axis of rotation between the parts. The dimension of lobe 177 may be very small relative to the size of convex mating surface 175. The rounded perimeter of lobe 177 may project as little as 0.002 inches from convex mating surface 175. Smaller or larger lobe configurations may also be used.
