Example 34B
rac-1-cyclobutyl 2-ethyl (2R,3S,4R,5R)-3-(tert-butyl)-4-nitro-5-phenylpyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylate
rac-(2R,3S,4R,5R)-Ethyl 3-(tert-butyl)-4-nitro-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (Core 1, 1.01 g, 3.15 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) and trimethylamine (0.9 mL, 6.46 mmol) was added, followed by cyclobutyl chloroformate (Example 34A, 1.3 g, 9.66 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 4 hours, at which point it was complete. The reaction mixture was diluted with dichloromethane (50 mL) and washed with 1M aqueous HCl (2×50 mL) and brine. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to provide ˜2 g of crude product. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (dichloromethane, Rf=0.25) to provide the title compound (1.31 g, 99%).
