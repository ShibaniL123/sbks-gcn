TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to construction components, and particularly to construction components that can be used both in toy construction sets and puzzles. BACKGROUND One known analog from prior art is the construction component from the company “LEGO”, containing a base, which is created, as a rule, in the form of a parallelepiped with one or more interlocking joints (patent RU 2150985 of 20 Jun. 2000). A disadvantage of the known construction component is poor functionality because its design permits only one possible type of connection between identical construction components. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the claimed invention is to create a construction component which provides many options for interlocking similar components. The technical result comprises increasing the functional possibilities of the construction component by increasing the connection options of the proposed construction component with other components of the same type and introducing additional elements to provide a movable connection. The technical result of the first construction component embodiment is achieved due to the construction component containing a base and interlocking joint. The base is made flat and has a rectangular form, with sides made in multiples of <<a>>. The interlocking joint is created by positioning protrusions on the base, which form four groups of protrusions. The first group of protrusions is positioned at least on one side of the base in tubular form, having ring-shaped cross-sections with an outer diameter equal to <<a>>. The height of the protrusions in the first group is greater than <<0.5a>> but no greater than <<a>>. The second group has protrusions positioned on at least one side of the base that are tubular, with cross-sections in the form of a square having side length in the tubular protrusion equal to <<a>>. The height of the protrusions in the second group is equal to <<0.5a>>. In the third group, protrusions are made in the form of rectangular plates, positioned with its midline on the ends of the base, flush with these ends, and having ledges with width equal to <<a>> along the short sides protruding not more than <<0.5a>> from the base ends. The ledges are angled towards each other with the gap formed between their end parts no greater than <<a>>. Protrusions in the fourth group are made in the form of corners, having shelves positioned perpendicular to the base planes on its adjacent ends and flush with these ends. Shelves have a length equal to <<a>> and width no greater than <<0.5a>>. All protrusions are positioned on the base in accordance with the coordinate grid of mutually perpendicular lines parallel to base edges. The distance between neighboring lines of the coordinate grid is equal to <<2a>>. The distance between the base edges and neighboring lines on the coordinate grid −<<0.5a>>. Protrusions from the first group are positioned at points where the grid lines intersect. Protrusions from the second group are positioned at points where the diagonals of the cells of the coordinate grid intersect. Protrusions from the third group are positioned in the middle between the neighboring protrusions from the first group that are positioned flush with the ends of the base. Protrusions from the fourth group are positioned in the corners of the base. The technical result according to the first embodiment of the constructor element is achieved by at least one protrusion from the first group having at least one channel on the inner side.

Protrusions 6 from the fourth group are positioned in the corners of the base 1. Here we describe a constructor element, according to the fourth embodiment (see FIG. 4). Constructor element, according to the fourth embodiment, contains a base 1, made flat and having a rectangular form, with at least one side equal to <<a>>, the other a multiple of <<a>>, and an interlocking joint, created by positioning protrusions on the base, which form three groups of protrusions. The first group of protrusions 2 and 7 positioned at least on one side of the base 1. The height of protrusions 2 and 7 (see FIG. 6) <<H>> is greater than <<0.5a>> but no greater than <<a>>.

Protrusions 6 from the third group are positioned in the corners of the base 1. When connecting constructor elements to one another, the protrusions of different elements interlock with each other. Interlocking is based on the force of friction, occurring between protrusions during close contact with each other. When connecting elements to one another, the protrusions of different groups simultaneously engage in interlocking, which provides improved connection strength. Let's consider examples of such connections. FIG. 11 shows two constructor elements prior to connecting, with protrusions entering into interlock with each other indicated. The top element 9 is implemented according to the fourth embodiment and the lower element 10 is implemented according to the third embodiment. A protrusion 11 from the first group of element 9 enters into interlock with protrusion 12 of the second group of element 10. Protrusion 13 from the second group of element 9 enters into interlock with protrusion 14 from the first group of element 10. Protrusion 15 from the second group of element 9 enters into interlock with protrusion 16 from the first group of element 10. Protrusion 17 from the first group of element 9 enters into interlock with protrusion 18 from the third group of element 10. FIG. 12 shows these elements in an interlocked state. FIG. 13 shows two constructor elements 19 and 20 prior to connecting, with indicated protrusions entering into interlock with each other upon connection. Both elements are implemented according to the third embodiment. Protrusion 21 from the third group of element 19 enters into interlock with four protrusions of element 20: protrusion 22 from the third group, protrusion 23 from the second group, protrusion 24 from the first group, and protrusion 25 from the first group. Protrusion 23 from the second group of element 20 enters into interlock with protrusion 26 from the fourth group of element 19. FIG. 14 shows these elements in an interlocked state. FIG. 15 shows two constructor elements prior to connecting with indicated protrusions entering into interlock with each other upon connection. Constructor element 27 is implemented according to the fourth embodiment, and element 28 is implemented according to the third embodiment. Protrusion 29 from the second group of element 27 enters into interlock with protrusion 30 from the third group of element 30. FIG. 16 shows these elements in an interlocked state. The constructor is characterized by the set of three types of elements it comprises. The first type of constructor element is analogous to constructor elements, implemented according to the first or third embodiments (see position 31 on FIG. 17). The second type of constructor element (see position 32 on FIG. 18) is analogous to constructor elements, implemented according to the second and fourth embodiments (see FIG. 18). The third type of constructor element 33 (see FIGS. 17,19) is made tubular and/or rod-shaped and are equipped with, at least, one protrusion on a side surface with the ability to longitudinally move constructor elements of the third type into protrusions with ring-shaped cross-section when placing protrusions of constructor elements of the third type into protrusions with ring-shaped cross-sections from the first group of elements of the first 31 or second 32 type (see FIGS. 17,19) when placing protrusions of constructor elements of the third type into grooves of protrusions with ring-shaped cross-section. FIG. 19 shows the placement of element 33 of the third type into the closed grooves of the protrusion from the first group of element 32 of the second type. The protrusion is shown in cross-section, so the closed grooves can be seen. FIG. 17 shows a set of constructor elements prior to being assembled into a construction, shown in FIGS. 20 and 21.
