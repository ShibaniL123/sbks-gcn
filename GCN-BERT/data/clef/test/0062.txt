LIQUID PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION OF CONJUGATED ERYTHROPOIETIN RELATED APPLICATION This application is related to Indian Provisional Application 1366/MUM/2014 filed 29th Mar, 2014 and is incorporated herein in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a liquid pharmaceutical composition comprising a conjugated erythropoietin, buffer, sugar, tonicity modifier and amino acid as an aggregation inhibitor. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone which stimulates red blood cells by a process known as erythropoiesis. EPO is produced in the kidney and stimulates the division and differentiation of committed erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow. In patients with renal insufficiency, serum EPO levels remain low, inappropriately low serum EPO levels may also be seen in anemic patients with cancer, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, ulcerative colitis and sickle cell anemia. For all these indications and to decrease the rate of blood transfusion, EPO is established as an effective treatment. The rHu EPO is a 165 amino acid containing glycoprotein produced through recombinant DNA technology in animal cell lines such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) and Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cell lines. The recombinant human erythropoietin (rHu EPO) has the same biological properties as endogenous erythropoietin secreted in humans. It has a molecular weight of about 36,000 daltons with carbohydrate moiety composing about 30% of molecular weight. Pegylation technology has emerged as a means to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmcodynamic properties of biopharmaceuticals. Some of the benefits of pegylation include improved clinical properties, enhanced solubility, sustained absorption and release, reduced immunogenicity and proteolysis, reduced clearance from circulation by the kidneys, increased dosing intervals due to higher in-vivo half-lives owing to increased circulation time and the like. The longer circulation of Erythropoietin results in beneficial therapeutic effects such as prolongation of its presence in the human body, effective therapeutic treatment of disease and conditions thereof. Pegylated Erythropoietin (MIRCERA® from Roche) is a Pegylated recombinant form of human EPO. The erythropoietin used to generate MIRCERA® is the active substance of Neorecormon® (epoetin beta; Roche's recombinant EPO first approved for general medical use in the EU in 1996). The PEG moiety used is methoxypolyethylene glycol-succinimidyl butanoic acid (PEG- SBA); a 30 kDa linear chemically activated PEG. The PEG-SBA spontaneously forms amide linkages with either EPO's N- terminal amino group or with the ε-amino group of an accessible surface lysine residue (Lys 45 or Lys 52). The final product generated is a 60 kDa monopegylated product. US4992419 disclosed a compatible, storage-stable human protein preparation containing a human protein, a physiologically compatible buffer and optionally complex formers, isotonicity-adjusting agents, calcium chloride and other materials usual for injection purposes which, in an injectable form, contain 5 to 50 gm/liter urea, 1 to 50 gm/liter amino acid and 0.05 to 5 gm/liter non-ionic wetting agent. A process for the production of this preparation is also disclosed. US6120761 and US7011825 disclosed an erythropoietin solution preparation containing an amino acid as a stabilizer, and having excellent long-term storage stability. US7202208 disclosed a liquid pharmaceutical composition consisting essentially of an erythropoietin protein, a multiple charged inorganic anion in a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer suitable to keep the solution pH in the range from about 5.5 to about 7.0, and optionally one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. This composition is especially useful for the prophylaxis and treatment of diseases related to erythropoiesis. US7842661 disclosed conjugates between erythropoietin and PEG moieties. The conjugates are linked via an intact glycosyl linking group interposed between and covalently attached to the peptide and the modifying group. The conjugates are formed from glycosylated peptides by the action of a glycosyltransferase. The glycosyltransferase ligates a modified sugar moiety onto a glycosyl residue on the peptide. Also provided are methods for preparing the conjugates, methods for treating various disease conditions with the conjugates, and pharmaceutical formulations including the conjugates. IN220067 disclosed a new stable pharmaceutical composition of erythropoietin (EPO) that is stabilized with a combination of a poloxamer polyol and a polyhydric alcohol. IN234438 disclosed an aqueous formulation of human erythropoietin, comprising the human erythropoietin of the kind such as herein described and the range of 100 lU/ml to 120,000 lU/ml; non- ionic surfactant of the kind such as herein described and the range of 0.0001 to 0.01% (w/v), polyhydric alcohol of the kind such as herein described and the range of 0.001 to 2% (w/v), neutral amino acid of the kind such as herein described and the range of 0.001 to 2% (w/v) and sugar alcohol of the kind such as herein described and the range of 0.1 to 1.0% (w/v) as stabilizers; isotonic reagent of the kind such as herein described and the range of 0.001 to 0.7% (w/v); and buffering reagent of the kind such as herein described and the range of 1 mM to 50 mM and the range of pH 6.0 to 7.5. However, the bioavailability of commercially available protein therapeutics such as EPO is limited by their short plasma half-life and susceptibility to protease degradation. These shortcomings prevent them from attaining maximum clinical potency. Despite the revolutionary progress in the large-scale manufacturing of proteins for therapeutic use, effective and convenient delivery of these agents in the body remains a major challenge due to their intrinsic physicochemical properties such as large molecular size, self association, physical and chemical instability, aggregation and adsorption. Hence, a novel formulation is required which can overcome all such instability of the formulation available in prior art.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The erythropoietin used in the present invention is a recombinant human erythropoietin (rHu EPO). It is a 165 amino acid containing glycoprotein produced through recombinant DNA technology in animal cell lines such as Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) and Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cell lines. The recombinant human erythropoietin (rHu EPO) has the same biological properties as endogenous erythropoietin secreted in humans. It has a molecular weight of about 36,000 daltons with carbohydrate moiety composing about 30% of molecular weight. Conjugated Erythropoietins are recombinant erythropoietin molecule covalently attached to a polyethylene glycol molecule. In preferred embodiments, the conjugated erythropoietin of the present invention comprises recombinant erythropoietin as defined by determination of a consensus sequence of naturally occurring erythropoietins being covalently linked to polyethylene glycol with a linker of the formulation selected from the group consisting of -CO-(CH2)5-(OCH2CH2)m-OR, -OCO- (OCH2CH2)n-OR and monomethoxy-PEG-Nitro phenyl carbamate/carbonate with the carbonyl of each polyethylene group forming an amide bond with one of said amino groups. The present invention provides a stabilized pharmaceutical formulation of conjugated protein along with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The present invention relates to a stabilized pharmaceutical composition comprising a conjugated erythropoietin, buffer, sugar, tonicity modifier and amino acid as an aggregation inhibitor at a pH range of 4.9 to 5.3. The buffer is used in the present invention to maintain the pH in the range of about 4.8 to 5.5, preferably in the range of 4.9 to 5.4, more preferably in the range of 5.0-5.4 and most preferably at about pH 5.2-5.4 and the buffer is selected from the group consisting of acetate, arginine, succinate and histidine either alone or a combination thereof. The polyol or sugar used in the present invention is selected from the group consisting of monosaccharide such as glucose and mannose, and the like either alone or in combination thereof, dissacharides such as sucrose, trehalose, and maltose, and the like either alone or in combination thereof, sugar alcohols such as mannitol and xylitol, and the like either alone or in combination thereof. More preferably the polyol or sugar used in the present invention is sucrose. The presence of sugars and sugar alcohols protect the molecules during storage at relatively high temperature. Aggregation inhibitors reduce a polypeptide's tendency to form aggregates. The amino acids like arginine, glycine, methionine and lysine tend to reduce aggregation of the conjugated erythropoietin in a formulation for prolonged period of time. A tonicity modifier is understood to be a molecule that contributes to the osmolality of a solution. The osmolality of a pharmaceutical composition is preferably regulated in order to maximize the active ingredient's stability and also to minimize discomfort to the patient upon administration. Examples of tonicity modifiers suitable for modifying osmolality include, but are not limited to sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride and the like. The novel, thermostable, aqueous pharmaceutical composition of recombinant conjugated erythropoietin described in the present invention has the following advantages: 1. Involves use of an aggregation inhibitor, which prevents the aggregation of the conjugated erythropoietin. 2. Involves use of a buffer system selected from the group consisting of acetate, arginine, succinate and histidine either alone or a combination thereof which maintains the pH of the formulation between 4.9 to 5.3 and also maintains the purity of the formulation at elevated temperature during storage. 3. Involves use of a sugar which provides better stability. 4. The pharmaceutical composition of present invention is maintained at pH between 4.9 to 5.3 which is critical in maintaining the purity and stability of the aqueous composition at elevated temperatures during storage. 5. Involves operational simplicity. The following example illustrate the pharmaceutical compositions described in the present invention and the means of carrying out the invention to obtain a stabilized pharmaceutical composition comprising conjugated erythropoietin. Example 1 a) Screening and selection of aggregation inhibitors Table 1: Optimization of Arginine concentration Experiment Details: Formulation with varying amount of Arginine is prepared and charged at 50°C. Sample were withdrawn at different time point and checked for Purity by SE HPLC (High molecular weight impurity) Results: Result of above experiment (Figure 1) shows that the formulation 1 which contain more Arginine (8.5 mg/ml) is shows more purity (Less aggregation) than the formulation 2 which contain less Arginine (5.3 mg/ml). Innovator formulation doesn't have Arginine. Figure 1 clearly shows the less purity in RMP than the formulation 1 and 2 which are having Arginine in the formulation. Conclusion: Arginine in the formulation of Pegylated erythropoietin prevent the aggregation. Example 2 a) Screening of buffers In order to identify the buffer component, combinations were studied with various buffer components which included Histidine- HC1, Histidine- Acetate, Arginine-Acetate and Succinate. Detail composition of buffer is given in the Table: 2. PEG-EPO in different buffers were incubated at 40 °C for 2 days and then the result of reducing & non-reducing gels were compared with each other and with their respective controls, kept at 2-8 °C. Table: 2 Results: The observed depegylation of PEG-EPO from the above results is in the sequence of Histidine Acetate > Histidine Hcl > Arginine- acetate > Succinate buffer. (Figure 2 & Figure 3) It is also clear that the LMw (less Mw than EPO) impurity is also less in Succinate buffer in comparison to others. So, it can be said that PEG-EPO is more stable in Succinate buffer in comparison to other buffers. Moreover, arginine - acetate combination also showed less impurity and almost equal impurity formation as succinate buffer. b) Further the Succinate and Acetate buffer were compared. Detail composition of buffer is given in the Table: 3. PEG-EPO in Acetate and succinate buffers were incubated at 50 °C for 6 days and then the purity by SEC HPLC were compared: Experiment Details: Table: 3. PEG-EPO in Acetate and succinate buffers Results: From the result of above experiment (Figure 4) it can be observed that the formulation 2 (F2) having acetate buffer shows more purity compared the other formulation. Example 3 a) Effect of pH Experiment Details: Sample were prepared in the final composition having Acetate buffer, Arginine, sucrose and sodium chloride at different pH and charged at elevated temperature (40°C) for pH dependent stability. Samples were analyzed by SE HPLC to determine the aggregation level at different pH; Table: 4 pH study Results: Table: 5 Results of pH study Conclusion: Above results (Table 5 & Figure 5) shows that by lowering the pH aggregation level (HMW) increases. Samples having pH 5.3 and 5.5 showed less aggregation level are found to be more stable as compared to lower pH samples. Example 4 a) Preparation of conjugated erythropoietin composition Table 6: Formulation details The novel formulations of conjugated erythropoietin are prepared using suitable combination of buffer, an aggregation inhibitor, tonicity modifier and stabilizer in suitable combination thereof. Method of Preparation: The process starts with the preparation of formulation buffer by dissolving Glacial acetic acid, Arginine, Sodium Chloride and Sucrose in water for injection in sequential manner by continues stirring at 500 rpm. pH is checked and, if required, the adjustment is made with glacial acetic acid solution (10 %) or Sodium Hydroxide solution (0.1 N) to obtain the pH of 5.1 + 0.2. Make the volume 100 % with WFI and stir the solution for homogeneity. Samples are withdrawn at this stage for IPQC tests. Required amounts of formulation buffer and calculated amount of Peg-EPO Drug Substance is added with continuous stirring. Samples are withdrawn at this stage for IPQC tests. Filter the solution through 0.2 μηι filter, using platinum cured silicon tubing Fill the solution in USP Type I glass PFS/ vial and seal the container using sterile rubber stopper. The novel formulation prepared by the said invention comprises an effective amount of biologically active conjugated erythropoietin which can be used in treating anemia associated with chronic renal failure. They are preferably used as injectable aqueous solutions.
