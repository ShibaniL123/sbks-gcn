Example 60A
3-Ethyl-5-methyl-1-(tetrahydrofuran-2-ylmethyl)thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (racemate)
1.0 g (4.76 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 42A and 2.32 g (7.13 mmol) of caesium carbonate were stirred in 12 ml of anhydrous DMF at RT for 10 min, before 1.18 ml (7.13 mmol) of racemic 2-(bromomethyl)tetrahydrofuran were added. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was heated in a microwave oven (Biotage Initiator with dynamic control of irradiation power) to 100Â° C. for 90 min. After cooling to RT, the mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed successively with water and saturated sodium chloride solution. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, the mixture was filtered and concentrated to dryness. The residue obtained was first purified by MPLC (Biotage cartridge, 100 g of silica gel, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 10:1-8:1). This gave a mixture of 0- and N-alkylated product (1.27 g), which was separated into its components by means of preparative HPLC (Method 8). After combination of the product fractions, concentration and drying under high vacuum, 1.09 g (78% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
