THERAPEUTIC PROSTAGLANDIN RECEPTOR AGONISTS By Yariv Donde and Jeremiah H. Nguyen CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial Number 61/994,018, filed on May 15, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD [002] The present disclosure is drawn towards compounds, compositions, and methods of treating various conditions, and in particular therapeutic prostaglandin receptor agonists which in some embodiments are useful for the treatment of conditions such as glaucoma and wounds and for promoting hair growth and reducing intraocular pressure. BACKGROUND [003] Ocular hypotensive agents are useful in the treatment of a number of various ocular hypertensive conditions, such as post-surgical and post-laser trabeculectomy ocular hypertensive episodes, glaucoma, and as pre-surgical adjuncts. [004] Glaucoma is a disease of the eye characterized by increased intraocular pressure. On the basis of its etiology, glaucoma has been classified as primary or secondary. For example, primary glaucoma in adults (congenital glaucoma) may be either open-angle or acute or chronic angle-closure. Secondary glaucoma results from pre-existing ocular diseases such as uveitis, intraocular tumor or an enlarged cataract. [005] The underlying causes of primary glaucoma are not yet known. The increased intraocular tension is due to the obstruction of aqueous humor outflow. In chronic open- angle glaucoma, the anterior chamber and its anatomic structures appear normal, but drainage of the aqueous humor is impeded. In acute or chronic angle-closure glaucoma, the anterior chamber is shallow, the filtration angle is narrowed, and the iris may obstruct the trabecular meshwork at the entrance of the canal of Schlemm. Dilation of the pupil may push the root of the iris forward against the angle, and may produce pupilary block and thus precipitate an acute attack. Eyes with narrow anterior chamber angles are predisposed to acute angle-closure glaucoma attacks of various degrees of severity. [006] Secondary glaucoma is caused by any interference with the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber into the anterior chamber and subsequently, into the canal of Schlemm. Inflammatory disease of the anterior segment may prevent aqueous escape by causing complete posterior synechia in iris bombe, and may plug the drainage channel with exudates. Other common causes are intraocular tumors, enlarged cataracts, central retinal vein occlusion, trauma to the eye, operative procedures and intraocular hemorrhage. [007] Considering all types together, glaucoma occurs in about 2% of all persons over the age of 40 and may be asymptotic for years before progressing to rapid loss of vision. In cases where surgery is not indicated, prostaglandin analogs are the current first line treatment for glaucoma management. BRIEF SUMMARY [008] Described herein are optionally substituted cyclopentanones, such as optionally substituted 2,3-diarylalkyl cyclopentanones, which can have binding or activity at prostaglandin receptors, such as prostaglandin E receptors, including EP4.

In some embodiments, administration of a compound described herein may be useful for the healing of dermal or epithelial wounds, including for example wounds relating to cosmetic surgery. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [015] Certain eicosanoids and their derivatives can be used in glaucoma management. Eicosanoids and derivatives include numerous biologically important compounds such as prostaglandins and their derivatives. Prostaglandins can be described as derivatives of prostanoic acid. Prostanoic acid has the following structural formula: [016] Various types of prostaglandins are classified by the structure and substituents carried on the alicyclic ring of the prostanoic acid skeleton. Further classification is based on the number of unsaturated bonds in the side chain indicated by numerical subscripts after the generic type of prostaglandin [e.g. prostaglandin Ei (PGEi), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)], and on the configuration of the substituents on the alicyclic ring indicated by a or Î² [e.g. prostaglandin F2a (PGF2a)]. Changes in the substituents of carbons 9, 10, and 1 1 can often influence the activity and selectivity of these compounds at the different prostaglandin receptors. Other compounds having more remote structures from natural prostaglandins can also have activity at prostaglandin receptors. For example, some optionally substituted 2,3-diarylalkyl cyclopentanones can have activity at prostaglandin receptors, such as the prostaglandin EP4 receptor. [017] Unless otherwise indicated, when a compound or chemical structural feature such as aryl is referred to as being "optionally substituted," it includes a feature that has no substituents (i.e. unsubstituted), or a feature that is "substituted," meaning that the feature has one or more substituents. The term "substituent" has the broadest meaning known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and includes a moiety that replaces one or more hydrogen atoms in a parent compound or structural feature. The term "replaces" is merely used herein for convenience, and does not require that the compound be formed by replacing one atom with another. In some embodiments, a substituent may be any ordinary organic moiety known in the art, which may have a molecular weight (e.g. the sum of the atomic masses of the atoms of the substituent) of 15 g/mol to 50 g/mol, 15 g/mol to 100 g/mol, 15 g/mol to 150 g/mol, 15 g/mol to 200 g/mol, 15 g/mol to 300 g/mol, or 15 g/mol to 500 g/mol. In some embodiments, a substituent comprises, or consists of: 0-30, 0-20, 0-10, or 0-5 carbon atoms; and 0-30, 0-20, 0-10, or 0-5 heteroatoms, wherein each heteroatom may independently be: N, O, P, S, Si, F, CI, Br, or I; provided that the substituent includes one C, N, O, P, S, Si, F, CI, Br, or I atom. [018] Where substituents are specified as a range, the range encompasses each individual integer value of substituent including the beginning and ending value of the range. For example, the description of a substituent as "Ci to C6 alkyl" (or "Ci-C6 alkyl" or "Ci-6 alkyl") encompasses Ci alkyl, C2 alkyl, C3 alkyl, C alkyl, C5 alkyl, and C6 alkyl. Similarly, the description of a value of "n" (e.g. "(CH2)n") as being "0 to 3" (or "0-3") encompasses values of "n" of 0, 1 , 2, and 3. A skilled person will realize upon a reading of the present disclosure that similar considerations apply to other substituents that can be described in terms of a range (e.g. "5 to 10 ring atoms" and "1 to 3 rings"). [019] Examples of substituents include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbyl, such as alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl; heteroalkyl, including any moiety wherein one or more heteroatoms replaces one or more carbon atoms of an alkyl moiety, and some accompanying hydrogen atoms (e.g. N replaces CH, O replaces CH2, CI replaces CH3, etc.), such as alkoxy, alkylthio, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, amino, etc.; heteroalkenyl, including any moiety wherein one or more heteroatoms replaces one or more carbon atoms of an alkenyl moiety, and some accompanying hydrogen atoms, such as acyl, acyloxy, thiocarbonyl, alkylcarboxylate, O-carbamyl, N-carbamyl, O-thiocarbamyl, N-thiocarbamyl, C-amido, N-amido, sulfinyl, isocyanato, isothiocyanato, etc; heteroalkynyl, including any moiety wherein one or more heteroatoms replaces one or more carbon atoms of an alkynyl moiety, and some accompanying hydrogen atoms, such as cyano, thiocyanato, cyanato; aryl; heteroaryl; hydroxy; aryloxy; thiol; halo; S- sulfonamido; N-sulfonamido; nitro, silyl; sulfonyl; trihalomethanesulfonyl; trihalomethanesulfonamido; etc. [020] For convenience, the term "molecular weight" is used with respect to a moiety or part of a molecule to indicate the sum of the atomic masses of the atoms in the moiety or part of a molecule, even though it may not be a complete molecule. [021] The structures associated with some of the chemical names referred to herein are depicted below. These structures may be unsubstituted, as shown below, or a substituent may independently be in any position normally occupied by a hydrogen atom when the structure is unsubstituted.

[091] In some embodiments, a subject compound is a prostaglandin receptor agonist. For example, a subject compound may be an agonist of a prostaglandin EP4 receptor with a functional EC50 value of about 10 Î¼Î or less, about 1 Î¼Î or less, about 200 nM or less, about 100 nM or less, about 50 nM or less, about 20 nM or less, about 10 nM or less, or about 1 nM or less, and may have an EC50 value as low as 10 pM, 1 pM, or 0.01 pM. [092] In some embodiments, a subject compound is more active at the prostaglandin EP4 receptor than at any other prostaglandin receptor. For example, a subject compound may have a functional or binding EC50 that is at least about 10 times, about 100 times, or at least about 1000 times lower, and may be up to 100,000 times lower, than the functional or binding EC50 for the same compound at any other prostaglandin receptor. [093] Subject compounds can be used for reducing intraocular pressure. A subject compound can be administered systemically, topically to the eye, or by another route of administration, to a mammal in need thereof. Reduction of intraocular pressure can delay or prevent the onset of glaucoma, such as primary open angle glaucoma, and to delay or prevent further vision loss in patients with primary open angle glaucoma. Thus, subject compounds are also useful for treating glaucoma. [094] Subject compounds can also be used for growing hair. For example, a subject compound may be administered to a mammal in which hair growth is desired. Administration can be systemic, topical to the area in which hair growth is desired, or by another route of administration. Growing hair can include one or more of: increasing the number of individual hairs, increasing the length of individual hairs, and increasing the width or thickness of individual hairs. Subject compounds are also useful for improving the appearance of hair, including increasing its gloss, shine, or other properties related to the reflection or dispersion of light, as well as changing the color of hair, including changing hair from grey or white to the color the hair was before it turned grey or white, such as red, brown, or black. [095] For the purposes of this disclosure, "treat," "treating," or "treatment" includes use of a compound, composition, therapeutically active agent, or drug in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or other undesirable condition. [096] A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" includes any salt that retains the activity of the parent compound and is acceptable for pharmaceutical use. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt also refers to any salt which may form in vivo as a result of administration of an acid, another salt, or a prodrug which is converted into an acid or salt. [097] Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acidic functional groups may be derived from organic or inorganic bases. The salt may comprise a mono or polyvalent ion. Of particular interest are the inorganic ions, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Organic salts may be made with amines, particularly ammonium salts such as mono-, di- and trialkyl amines or ethanol amines. Salts may also be formed with caffeine, tromethamine and similar molecules. Hydrochloric acid or some other pharmaceutically acceptable acid may form a salt with a compound that includes a basic group, such as an amine or a pyridine ring. (See, e.g., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts, P. Heinrich Stahl & Camille G. Wermuth (Eds), Verlag; Helvetica Chimica Acta- Zurich, 2002, 329-345.) The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is also meant to include salts of active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituent moieties found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amino, or magnesium salt, or a similar salt. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, for example, Berge et al., "Pharmaceutical Salts", Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 1977, 66:1 - 19). Certain specific compounds of the present invention may contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts. [098] A prodrug includes a compound which is converted to a therapeutically active compound after administration, such as by hydrolysis of an ester group or some other biologically labile group. Ester prodrugs of the subject compounds are specifically contemplated. An ester may be derived from a carboxylic acid of C1 (i.e. the terminal carboxylic acid of a natural prostaglandin), or an ester may be derived from a carboxylic acid functional group on another part of the molecule, such as on a phenyl ring. Some examples of useful esters can include an alkyl ester, a hydroxyalkyl ester, a morpholinoalkyl ester, an aryl ester, or a heteroaryl ester. Prodrug preparation is well known in the art. For example, "Prodrugs and Drug Delivery Systems," which is a chapter in Richard B. Silverman, Organic Chemistry of Drug Design and Drug Action, 2d Ed., Elsevier Academic Press: Amsterdam, 2004, pp. 496-557, provides further detail on the subject. [099] Those skilled in the art will readily understand that for administration or the manufacture of medicaments, subject compounds can be admixed with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Specifically, a drug to be administered systemically, it may be confected as a powder, pill, tablet or the like, or as a solution, emulsion, suspension, aerosol, syrup or elixir suitable for oral or parenteral administration or inhalation. [0100] For solid dosage forms or medicaments, non-toxic solid carriers include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, the polyalkylene glycols, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose and magnesium carbonate. The solid dosage forms may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. [0101] Liquid pharmaceutically administrable dosage forms can, for example, comprise a solution or suspension of one or more of the subject compounds and optional pharmaceutical adjutants in a carrier, such as for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like. Typical examples of such auxiliary agents are sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine, sodium acetate, triethanolamine oleate, etc. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 16th Edition, 1980. The composition of the formulation to be administered, in any event, contains a quantity of one or more of the subject compounds in an amount effective to provide the desired therapeutic effect. [0102] Parenteral administration is generally characterized by injection, either subcutaneously, intramuscularly or intravenously. Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol and the like. In addition, if desired, the injectable pharmaceutical compositions to be administered may also contain minor amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents and the like. [0103] The amount of the subject compound or compounds administered is dependent on the therapeutic effect or effects desired, on the specific mammal being treated, on the severity and nature of the mammal's condition, on the manner of administration, on the potency and pharmacodynamics of the particular compound or compounds employed, and on the judgment of the prescribing physician. The therapeutically effective dosage of the subject compounds may be in the range of about 0.5 or about 1 to about 100 mg/kg/day. [0104]A liquid which is ophthalmically acceptable includes a liquid that is formulated such that it can be administered topically to the eye. The comfort can be a consideration, although sometimes formulation considerations (e.g. drug stability) may necessitate less than optimal comfort. In the case that comfort is not ideal, the liquid can be formulated such that the liquid is tolerable to the patient for topical ophthalmic use. Additionally, an ophthalmically acceptable liquid can be packaged for single use, or contain a preservative to prevent contamination over multiple uses. [0105] For ophthalmic application, solutions or medicaments are often prepared using a physiological saline solution as a major vehicle. Ophthalmic solutions can be maintained at a comfortable pH with an appropriate buffer system. The formulations may also contain conventional, pharmaceutically acceptable preservatives, stabilizers and surfactants. [0106] Preservatives that may be used in pharmaceutical compositions include, but are not limited to, benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol, thimerosal, phenylmercuric acetate and phenylmercuric nitrate. A useful surfactant is, for example, Tween 80. Likewise, various useful vehicles may be used in the ophthalmic preparations. These vehicles include, but are not limited to, polyvinyl alcohol, povidone, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, poloxamers, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose and purified water. [0107] Tonicity adjustors may be added as needed or convenient. They include, but are not limited to, salts, particularly sodium chloride, potassium chloride, mannitol and glycerin, or any other suitable ophthalmically acceptable tonicity adjustor. [0108] Various buffers and means for adjusting pH may be used in an ophthalmically acceptable liquid. Accordingly, buffers include acetate buffers, citrate buffers, phosphate buffers and borate buffers. Acids or bases may be used to adjust the pH of these formulations as needed. [0109] In a similar vein, an ophthalmically acceptable antioxidant for use in the an ophtalmically acceptable liquids include, but are not limited to, sodium metabisulfite, sodium thiosulfate, acetylcysteine, butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene. [0110] Other excipient components which may be included in ophthalmic preparations are chelating agents. A useful chelating agent is edetate disodium, although other chelating agents may also be used in place or in conjunction with it. [0111] Some ophthalmically acceptable liquid dosage forms include ingredients having the following amounts: Ingredient Amount (% w/v) subject compound about 0.001 -5 preservative 0-0.10 vehicle 0-40 tonicity adjustor 1 -10 buffer 0.01 -10 pH adjustor q.s. pH 4.5-7.5 antioxidant as needed surfactant as needed purified water as needed to make 100% [0112] For topical use, creams, ointments, gels, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing subject compounds are employed. Topical formulations can include a pharmaceutical carrier, co-solvent, emulsifier, penetration enhancer, preservative system, or emollient. [0113] The actual dose of a subject compound depends on factors such as the specific compound, and on the condition to be treated. The selection of the appropriate dose is well within the skill of the skilled artisan with the benefit of this disclosure. [0114] For treatment of diseases affecting the eye including glaucoma, subject compounds can be administered topically, periocularly, intraocularly, or by any other effective means known in the art. [0115] In one embodiment, the subject compounds can be useful in the treatment of baldness and/or hair loss. Alopecia (baldness) is a deficiency of either normal or abnormal hair, and is primarily a cosmetic problem in humans. It is a deficiency of terminal hair, the broad diameter, colored hair that is readily seen. However, in the so called bald person, although there is a noticeable absence of terminal hair, the skin does contain vellus hair, which is a fine colorless hair which may require microscopic examination to determine its presence. This vellus hair is a precursor to terminal hair. [0116] The subject compounds can be used to stimulate, such as the conversion of vellus hair to growth as terminal hair, as well as increasing the rate of growth of terminal hair. [0117] The subject compounds can also be used to stimulate growth of eye lashes. Application of a subject compound to an eye or an eyelid can result in lashes that are longer and have a fuller, denser appearance in the treated eye. The changes in the lashes may be apparent on gross inspection. Possible changes to lashes can include increased length of lashes, increased number of lashes along the normal lash line, increased thickness and luster of lashes, increased auxiliary lash-like terminal hair in transitional areas adjacent to areas of normal lash growth, increased auxiliary lash-like terminal hairs at the medial and lateral canthal area, increased pigmentation of the lashes, increased numbers, increased length, as well as increased luster, and thickness of fine hair on the skin of the adjacent lid, and finally, increased perpendicular angulation from the skin surface. [0118] In one embodiment, the subject compound is mixed with a dermatologically compatible vehicle or carrier. The vehicle, which may be employed for preparing compositions as described herein, may comprise, for example, aqueous solutions such as e.g., physiological salines, oil solutions, or ointments. The vehicle furthermore may contain dermatologically compatible preservatives such as e.g., benzalkonium chloride, surfactants like e.g., polysorbate 80, liposomes or polymers, for example, methyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone and hyaluronic acid; these may be used for increasing the viscosity. Furthermore, it is also possible to use soluble or insoluble drug inserts when the drug is to be administered. [0119] In one embodiment, dermatological compositions can be formulated for topical treatment for the stimulation of hair growth which comprises an effective hair growth simulating amount of one or more subject compounds and a dermatologically compatible carrier. Effective amounts of the subject compounds may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, but will vary depending on the compound employed, frequency of application and desired result. The subject compound will generally range from about 0.0000001 to about 50% by weight; about 0.001 to about 50% by weight; or about 0.1 to about 30% by weight of the dermatological composition. [0120] In one embodiment, the application of the subject compounds for stimulation of hair growth finds applications in mammalian species, including both humans and animals. In humans, the subject compounds can be applied for example, to the scalp, face beard, head, pubic area, upper lip, eyebrows, and eyelids. In animal raised for their pelts, e.g., mink, the subject compounds can be applied over the entire surface of the body to improve the overall pelt for commercial reasons. The process can also be used for cosmetic reasons in animals, e.g., applied to the skin of dogs and cats having bald patches due to mange or other diseases causing a degree of alopecia. [0121] The pharmaceutical compositions contemplated for the stimulation of hair growth include pharmaceutical compositions suited for topical and local action. The term "topical" as employed with respect to hair growth relates to the use of a subject compound incorporated in a suitable pharmaceutical carrier, and applied at the site of thinning hair or baldness for exertion of local action. Accordingly, such topical compositions include those pharmaceutical forms in which the subject compound is applied externally by direct contact with the skin to be treated. Conventional pharmaceutical forms for this purpose include ointments, liniments, creams, shampoos, lotions, pastes, jellies, sprays, aerosols, and the like, and may be applied in patches or impregnated dressings depending on the part of the body to be treated. The term "ointment" embraces formulations (including creams) having oleaginous, water-soluble and emulsion-type bases, e.g., petrolatum, lanolin, polyethylene glycols, as well as mixtures of these. [0122] Typically, the subject compounds can be applied repeatedly for the sustained period of time topically on the part of the body to be treated, for example, the eyelids, eyebrows, skin or scalp. The preferred dosage regimen will generally involve regular, such as daily, administration for a period of treatment of at least one month, at least three months, or at least six months. [0123] For topical use on the eyelids or eyebrows, the subject compounds can be formulated in aqueous solutions, creams, ointments, or oils exhibiting physologically acceptable osmolarity by addition of pharmaceutically acceptable buffers and salts, such formulations may or may not, depending on the dispenser, contain preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine, chlorobutanol, parahydroxybenzoic acids and phenylmercuric salts such as nitrate, chloride, acetate, and borate, or antioxidants, as well as additives like EDTA, sorbitol, boric acid and the like as additives. Furthermore, particularly aqueous solutions may contain viscosity increasing agents such as polysaccharides, e.g., methylcellulose, mucopolysaccharides, e.g., hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate, or poly alcohol, e.g., polyvinylalcohol. Various slow releasing gels and matricies may also be employed as well as soluble and insoluble ocular inserts, for instance, based on substances forming in situ gels. Depending on the actual formation and compound to be used, various amounts of the drug and different dose regimens may be employed. Typically, the daily amount of subject compound for treatment of the eyelid may be about 0.1 ng to about 100 mg per eyelid. [0124] For topical use on the skin and scalp, the subject compound can be advantageously formulated using ointments, creams, liniments or patches as a carrier of the active ingredient. Also, these formulations may or may not contain preservatives, depending on the dispenser and nature of use. Such preservatives include those mentioned above, and methyl-, propyl-, or butyl-parahydroxybenzoic acid, betaine, chlorhexidine, benzalkonium chloride, and the like. Various matrices for the slow release delivery may also be used. Typically, the dose to be applied on the scalp is in the range of about 0.1 ng to about 100 mg per day, more preferably about 1 ng to about 10 mg per day, and most preferably about 10 ng to about 1 mg per day depending on the subject compound and the formulation. To achieve the daily amount of medication depending on the formulation, the subject compound may be administered once or several times daily with or without antioxidants.
