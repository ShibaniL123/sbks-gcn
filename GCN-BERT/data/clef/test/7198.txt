DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As shown in FIG. 1, the reflective headwear is made of a reflective insulation material with the reflective insulation material exposed on the top side and apparel fabric stitched to the bottom side or in other decorative ways. The reflective insulation material is an insulation material typically used in houses to insulate various parts of a house and is made with two layers of 96% reflective metalized aluminum separated by 5/16″ enclosed airspace. As shown in FIG. 1, adhesives are placed on the fabric side of the reflective headwear so that the reflective insulation material faces upward. Adhesives are also placed on the bill of a billed cap or another piece of headwear. To assemble the reflective headwear to a cap or other head gear, the reflective headwear is placed, adhesive and fabric side down, on top of the bill of a cap or preferred piece of headwear and pressure applied to ensure that the reflective headwear and the preferred headwear are connected. The reflective headwear that attaches to headwear is cut to be 7½″ long, 10⅝″ wide, and 5/16″ thick; however, the actual finished product dimensions are minimally reduced after assembly and may vary slightly based upon stitching. The reflective headwear shown in FIG. 1 is made by using reflective headwear shown in FIG. 1 is made by using reflective insulation material, any type of fabric, and any type of headwear. The reflective headwear shown in FIG. 1 provides additional shade from the sun by extending the bill of a cap or other headwear while also reflecting and absorbing the sun and heat rays. FIG. 2 provides a sketch of the left side profile of the reflective headwear that depicts a more realistic image of the reflective headwear to be attached to preferred headwear showcasing the curvature of the reflective headwear. As shown in FIG. 3, the reflective headwear is made of a reflective insulation material with the reflective insulation material exposed on the top side and apparel fabric stitched to the bottom side or in other decorative ways. The reflective insulation material is an insulation material typically used in houses to insulate various parts of a house and is made with two lawyers of 96% reflective metalized aluminum separated by 5/16″ enclosed airspace. As shown in FIG. 3, no adhesives are placed on the fabric side of the reflective headwear; rather, two slits are made towards the back of the visor to accommodate the insertion of eyewear. To assemble the reflective headwear to eyewear, place the temples of eyewear into the fabric side of the reflective headwear so that the ends of the eyewear come out on top of the reflective side. The reflective headwear is then adjusted on the temples of the eyewear to the desired location. The reflective headwear that attaches to eyewear is cut to be 7″ long, 10⅝″ wide, and 5/16″ thick however, the actual finished product dimensions are minimally reduced after assembly and may vary slightly based upon stitching. The reflective headwear shown in FIG. 3 is made by using reflective insulation material, any type of fabric, and any pair of eyewear. In addition, the eyewear reflective headwear has a sweat absorbent brim to catch sweat that may form on the forehead or other part of the face. The reflective headwear shown in FIG. 3 provides additional shade from the sun by attaching a bill, with a sweat absorbent brim, to any pair of eyewear, while also reflecting and absorbing the sun and heat rays. FIG. 4 provides a sketch of the left side profile of the reflective headwear that depicts a more realistic image of the eyewear reflective headwear showcasing the curvature of the reflective headwear. As shown in FIG. 5, the reflective headwear is made of a reflective insulation material with the reflective insulation material exposed on the top side and apparel fabric stitched to the bottom side or in other decorative ways. The reflective insulation material is an insulation material typically used in houses to insulate various parts of a house and is made with two layers of 96% reflective metalized aluminum separated by 5/16″ enclosed airspace. As shown in FIG. 5, a thin piece of reflective insulation material is attached to the visor and extends around the head on each side of the visor. The two thin pieces of reflective insulation material connect by the use of a hook and loop fastener, other adhesive, or a buckle in the back. Essentially FIG. 5's design creates a free standing visor without the need for head gear or eyewear. To assemble the freestanding reflective headwear, place the visor around the head and attach the hook and loop fastener or other adhesive in the back. The free standing reflective headwear is cut to be 7″ long plus the diameter for the head area, 10½″ wide and 5/16″ thick; however, the actual finished product dimensions are minimally reduced after assembly and may vary slightly based upon stitching. The reflective headwear shown in FIG. 5 is made by using reflective insulation material and any type of fabric. In addition, the freestanding reflective headwear has a sweat absorbent brim to catch sweat that may form on the forehead or other part of the face. The reflective headwear shown in FIG. 5 provides shade from the sun by providing a freestanding visor that extends over the face, while also reflecting and absorbing the sun and heat rays. FIG. 6 provides a sketch of the left side profile of the reflective headwear that depicts a more realistic image of the freestanding reflective headwear showcasing the curvature of the reflective headwear. As shown in FIG. 7, the reflective headwear is made of a reflective insulation material with the reflective insulation material exposed on the top side and apparel fabric stitched to the bottom side or in other decorative ways. The reflective insulation material is an insulation material typically used in houses to insulate various parts of a house and is made with two layers of 96% reflective metalized aluminum separated by 5/16″ enclosed airspace. As shown in FIG. 7, the reflective insulation material extends around the entire head to create a large brimmed hat providing protection to the face and the neck. The reflective hat is 5/16″ thick, and its length and width depend upon the head area. The reflective hat is cut and designed for a head area range from 6″ to 9″ in diameter, with a 6″ bill extending in the front, a 5″ bill extending in the back and 2⅝″ bills extending on either side of the head; however, the actual finished product dimensions are minimally reduced after assembly and may vary slightly based upon stitching. The reflective hat is equipped with a vent at the top of the hat to allow air to flow. The reflective headwear shown in FIG. 7 assumes a 7″ head area diameter and is made by using reflective insulation material and any type of fabric. The reflective hat shown in FIG. 7 provides shade from the sun by extending over the face, neck and ear and also reflecting and absorbing the sun and heat rays. FIG. 8 provides a sketch of the left side profile of the reflective hat that depicts a more realistic image of the reflective hat showcasing the curvature of the reflective headwear.
