METHODS OF SYNTHESIS AND PURIFICATION OF HETEROARYL COMPOUNDS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/254,917, filed October 26, 2009 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/328,480, filed April 27, 2010, the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference. 1. FIELD [0002] Provided herein are processes generally pertaining to the field of chemical synthesis and purification, and more specifically to methods of synthesis and/or purification of certain heteroaryl compounds. 2. BACKGROUND [0003] The connection between abnormal protein phosphorylation and the cause or consequence of diseases has been known for over 20 years. Accordingly, protein kinases have become a very important group of drug targets. See Cohen, Nature, 1:309-3 1 5 (2002). Various protein kinase inhibitors have been used clinically in the treatment of a wide variety of diseases, such as cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases, including diabetes and stroke. See Cohen, Eur. J. Biochem., 268:5001-5010 (2001). [0004] The elucidation of the intricacy of protein kinase pathways and the complexity of the relationship and interaction among and between the various protein kinases and kinase pathways highlights the importance of developing pharmaceutical agents capable of acting as protein kinase modulators, regulators or inhibitors that have beneficial activity on multiple kinases or multiple kinase pathways. Accordingly, there remains a need for new kinase modulators. [0005] The protein named mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), which is also called FRAP, RAFTI or RAPT1), is a 2549-amino acid Ser/Thr protein kinase, that has been shown to be one of the most critical proteins in the mTOR/PI3K/Akt pathway that regulates cell growth and proliferation. Georgakis and Younes Expert Rev. Anticancer Ther. 6(1):13 1-140 (2006). mTOR exists within two complexes, mTORCl and mTORC2. mTORCl is sensitive to rapamycin analogs (such as temsirolimus or everolimus) and mTORC2 is largely rapamycininsensitive. Several mTOR inhibitors have been or are being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. Temsirolimus was approved for use in renal cell carcinoma in 2007 and everolimus was approved in 2009 for renal cell carcinoma patients that have progressed on vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitors. In addition, sirolimus was approved in 1999 for the prophylaxis of renal transplant rejection. The interesting but limited clinical success of these mTORCl compounds demonstrates the usefulness of mTOR inhibitors in the treatment of cancer and transplant rejection, and the increased potential for compounds with both mTORCl and mTORC2 inhibitory activity. [0006] Citation or identification of any reference in Section 2 of this application is not to be construed as an admission that the reference is prior art to the present application. 3.

In some embodiments, heterocyclyl groups include 3 tolO ring members, whereas other such groups have 3 to 5, 3 to 6, or 3 to 8 ring members. Heterocyclyls can also be bonded to other groups at any ring atom (z'.e., at any carbon atom or heteroatom of the heterocyclic ring). A heterocycloalkyl group can be substituted or unsubstituted. Heterocyclyl groups encompass unsaturated, partially saturated and saturated ring systems, such as, for example, imidazolyl, imidazolinyl and imidazolidinyl groups. The phrase heterocyclyl includes fused ring species, including those comprising fused aromatic and non-aromatic groups, such as, for example, benzotriazolyl, 2,3dihydrobenzo[l,4]dioxinyl, and benzo[l,3]dioxolyl. The phrase also includes bridged polycyclic ring systems containing a heteroatom such as, but not limited to, quinuclidyl.

Others are well-known in the art, see for example, Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th eds., Mack Publishing, Easton PA (1990) or Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19th eds., Mack Publishing, Easton PA (1995). [0033] As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term “stereoisomer” or “stereomerically pure” means one stereoisomer of a Heteroaiyl Compound that is substantially free of other stereoisomers of that compound. For example, a stereomerically pure compound having one chiral center will be substantially free of the opposite enantiomer of the compound. A stereomerically pure compound having two chiral centers will be substantially free of other diastereomers of the compound. A typical stereomerically pure compound comprises greater than about 80% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 20% by weight of other stereoisomers of the compound, greater than about 90% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 10% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound, greater than about 95% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 5% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound, or greater than about 97% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 3% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound. The Heteroaryl Compounds can have chiral centers and can occur as racemates, individual enantiomers or diastereomers, and mixtures thereof. All such isomeric forms are included within the embodiments disclosed herein, including mixtures thereof. The use of stereomerically pure forms of such Heteroaryl Compounds, as well as the use of mixtures of those forms are encompassed by the embodiments disclosed herein. For example, mixtures comprising equal or unequal amounts of the enantiomers of a.particular Heteroaryl Compound may be used in methods and compositions disclosed herein. These isomers may be asymmetrically synthesized or resolved using standard techniques such as chiral columns or chiral resolving agents. See, e.g., Jacques, J., et al., Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions (Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1981); Wilen, S. H., et al., Tetrahedron 33:2725 (1977); Eliel, E. L., Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds (McGraw-Hill, NY, 1962); and Wilen, S. H., Tables of Resolving Agents and Optical Resolutions p. 268 (E.L. Eliel, Ed., Univ. of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, IN, 1972). [0034] It should also be noted the Heteroaryl Compounds can include E and Z isomers, or a mixture thereof, and cis and trans isomers or a mixture thereof. In certain embodiments, the Heteroaryl Compounds are isolated as either the cis or trans isomer. In other embodiments, the Heteroaryl Compounds are a mixture of the cis and trans isomers. [0035] "Tautomers" refers to isomeric forms of a compound that are in equilibrium with each other. The concentrations of the isomeric forms will depend on the environment the compound is found in and may be different depending upon, for example, whether the compound is a solid or is in an organic or aqueous solution. For example, in aqueous solution, pyrazoles may exhibit the following isomeric forms, which are referred to as tautomers of each other: N. HN H [0036] As readily understood by one skilled in the art, a wide variety of functional groups and other stuctures may exhibit tautomerism and all tautomers of compounds of formula (I) and formula (Π) are within the scope of the present invention. [0037] It should also be noted the Heteroaryl Compounds can contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine125 (125I), sulfur-35 (35S), or carbon-14 (14C), or may be isotopically enriched, such as with deuterium (2H), carbon13 (13C), or nitrogen-15 (15N). As used herein, an “isotopologue” is an isotopically enriched compound. The term “isotopically enriched” refers to an atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. “Isotopically enriched” may also refer to a compound containing at least one atom having an isotopic composition other than the natural isotopic composition of that atom. The term “isotopic composition” refers to the amount of each isotope present for a given atom. Radiolabeled and isotopically encriched compounds are useful as therapeutic agents, e.g., cancer and inflammation therapeutic agents, research reagents, e.g., binding assay reagents, and diagnostic agents, e.g., in vivo imaging agents. All isotopic variations of the Heteroaryl Compounds as described herein, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the embodiments provided herein. In some embodiments, there are provided isotopologues of the Heteroaryl Compounds, for example, the isotopologues are deuterium, carbon13, or nitrogen15 enriched Heteroaryl Compounds. [0038] “Treating” as used herein, means an alleviation, in whole or in part, of the disease or disorder, or symptoms associated with the disease or disorder, or slowing, or halting of further progression or worsening of the disease or disorder, or symptoms associated with the disease or disorder. [0039] “Preventing” as used herein, means prevention of the onset, recurrence, or spread of the disease or disorder, or symptoms associated with the disorder or disease, in a patient at risk for developing the disease or disorder. [0040] The term “effective amount” in connection with an Heteroaryl Compound means, in one embodiment, an amount capable of alleviating, in whole or in part, symptoms associated with a disorder or disease, or slowing or halting further progression or worsening of those symptoms, or, in another embodiment, an amount capable of preventing or providing prophylaxis for the disease or disorder in a subject at risk for developing the disease or disorder as disclosed herein, such as cancer, inflammatory conditions, immunological conditions, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, obesity, neurological disorders, age-related diseases, or cardiovascular conditions, and conditions treatable or preventable by inhibition of a kinase pathway, for example, the mTOR/PI3K/Akt pathway. In one embodiment an effective amount of a Heteroaryl Compound is an amount that inhibits a kinase in a cell, such as, for example, in vitro or in vivo. In one embodiment the kinase is mTOR, DNA-PK, PI3K or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the effective amount of the Heteroaryl Compound inhibits the kinase in a cell by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 99%, compared to the activity of the kinase in an untreated cell. The effective amount of the Heteroaiyl Compound, for example in a pharmaceutical composition, may be at a level that will exercise the desired effect; for example, about 0.005 mg/kg of a subject’s body weight to about 100 mg/kg of a patient’s body weight in unit dosage for both oral and parenteral administration. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, it is to be expected that the effective amount of an Heteroaiyl Compound disclosed herein may vary depending on the indication being treated, e.g., the effective amount of an Heteroaryl Compound would likely be different for treating patients suffering from, or at risk for, inflammatory conditions relative to the effective amount of the Compound for treating patients suffering from, or at risk of, a different disorder, e.g., cancer or a metabolic disorder. [0041] The term “patient” includes an animal, including, but not limited to, an animal such as a cow, monkey, horse, sheep, pig, chicken, turkey, quail, cat, dog, mouse, rat, rabbit or guinea pig, in one embodiment a mammal, in another embodiment a human. [0042] The term “cancer” refers to any of various malignant neoplasms characterized by the proliferation of cells that can invade surrounding tissue and metastasize to new body sites. Both benign and malignant tumors are classified according to the type of tissue in which they are found. For example, fibromas are neoplasms of fibrous connective tissue, and melanomas are abnormal growths of pigment (melanin) cells. Malignant tumors originating from epithelial tissue, e.g., in skin, bronchi, and stomach, are termed carcinomas. Malignancies of epithelial glandular tissue such as are found in the breast, prostate, and colon, are known as adenocarcinomas. Malignant growths of connective tissue, e.g., muscle, cartilage, lymph tissue, and bone, are called sarcomas. Lymphomas and leukemias are malignancies arising among white blood cells. Through the process of metastasis, tumor cell migration to other areas of the body establishes neoplasms in areas away from the site of initial appearance. Bone tissues are one of the most favored sites of metastases of malignant tumors, occurring in about 30% of all cancer cases. Among malignant tumors, cancers of the lung, breast, prostate or the like are particularly known to be likely to metastasize to bone. [0043] In the context of neoplasm, cancer, tumor growth or tumor cell growth, inhibition may be assessed by delayed appearance of primary or secondary tumors, slowed development of primary or secondary tumors, decreased occurrence of primary or secondary tumors, slowed or decreased severity of secondary effects of disease, arrested tumor growth and regression of tumors, among others. In the extreme, complete inhibition, is referred to herein as prevention or chemoprevention. In this context, the term "prevention" includes either preventing the onset of clinically evident neoplasia altogether or preventing the onset of a preclinically evident stage of neoplasia in individuals at risk. Also intended to be encompassed by this definition is the prevention of transformation into malignant cells or to arrest or reverse the progression of premalignant cells to malignant cells.

It should be noted that one skilled in the art can modify the procedures set forth in the illustrative schemes and examples to arrive at the desired product. Br NH2 C 0 o Bf'oABr RSrNvBro H D [0080] Synthesis of compounds of formula (I) is shown in Scheme 1. Starting from 5bromopyrazin-2-amine A, the R1 group can be introduced using the appropriate boronic acid or borate ester (R+ is H, or together with the boron atom and the atoms to which they are attached, form a cyclic boronate), palladium catalyst (such as, for example, dichloro[l,r-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium(Π)dichloromethane), solvent (such as dimethylformamide) and base (such as sodium carbonate) through a Suzuki coupling, or alternately with the appropriate stannane (R*"1’ is Cm alkyl), palladium catalyst (such as dichloro[ 1, 1 '-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium(Π)dichloromethane or palladium(dba)2/ tri-o-tolylphosphine) and solvent (such as dimethylformamide with or without the addition of a base such as triethylamine) using Stille coupling methodology. Typical reaction conditions and reagents for Suzuki and Stille reactions can be found herein (see also Rossi, et al, Synthesis 15:2419-2440 (2004), Buchwald et al. Accounts of Chemical Research, 41: 1461-1473(2008), Fu. Accounts of Chemical Research, 41: 1555-1564(2008), and Echavarren et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 43: 4704-4734 (2004) and references therein). The resulting R1 amino pyrazine B can be brominated using NBS or other standard brominating conditions to afford the brominated intermediate C, which is then reacted with 2-bromoacetic anhydride to afford the acylated intermediate D. The R2 substituent is introduced through amine addition to D and subsequent ring closure, in the presence of an amine base (such as, for example, triethyl amine) and heating in an appropriate solvent (such as acetonitrile) to afford the desired products. Br NH2 E o o Bf\Λ0ΛBr R1-B(OR*)j or R’-SrifR-b G Scheme 2 [0081] Alternatively as shown in Scheme 2, 3,5-dibromopyrazin-2-amine E, is treated with 2-bromoacetic anhydride as above to provide intermediate F. As described above, the R2 substituent is introduced through amine addition to F and subsequent ring closure to afford intermediate G. The R1 group may then be introduced using the methods described above, namely by reaction with the appropriate boronic acid or borate ester, in the presence of a palladium catalyst and base through a Suzuki coupling, or alternately with the appropriate stannane, in the presence of a palladium catalyst using Stille coupling methodology as described above, to afford the desired products.

Pd cat., base R1-B(OR+)2 or R1-Sn(R++)3 Scheme 4 [0083] To afford analogs with substitution alpha to the carbonyl (Scheme 4), the appropriately substituted amino-protected amino acid H (PN is amino protecting group such as Boc), is reacted with 3,5-dibromopyrazin-2-amine in the presence of a coupling agent, such as, for example, l,r-carbonyldiimidazole. Deprotection conditions (for example, when PN is Boc, deprotection is achieved by, for example, treatment with TFA or HC1), followed by palladium catalyzed ring closure (using, for example, sodium bicarbonate, palladium(Π) acetate and 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene) to afford intermediate I. As before, the R1 group may be introduced using the appropriate boronic acid or borate ester, palladium catalyst, solvent and base through a Suzuki coupling, or alternately with the appropriate stannane, palladium catalyst and solvent using Stille coupling methodology (described above) to afford the desired products. This method may also be used to afford analogs where R2 is hydrogen. Additionally, this route may be used to afford compounds wherein R3 and R4, together with the atom to which they are both attached, form a spiro-cyclic ring, through the use of appropriate starting amino acids. Scheme [0084] Analogs wherein R2 and R3 together with the atoms to which they are attached form a ring (see Scheme 5) may be obtained similarly to the chemistry shown in Scheme 4, beginning with the appropriate cyclic amino acid J. K2 Scheme 6 [0085] To obtain the desired products, the reactivity of the coupling partners may be reversed. For example, as shown in Scheme 6, intermediate I may be converted to the corresponding stannane K, through reaction with, for example, hexamethylditin (R++ is methyl) in the presence of a palladium catalyst (such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium) and the R1 group may be introduced using an appropriate leaving group, for example halogen (such as bromide) or triflate, and solvent using Stille coupling methodology as described above to afford the desired products. Alternatively, intermediate I may be converted to the corresponding boronate ester K2, by reaction with 4,4,4,,4',5,5,5',5'-octamethyl-2,2'-bi(l,3,2-dioxaborolane) in the presence of a palladium catalyst (such as l,r-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium(II)dichloromethane) and a base (such as potassium acetate) in a solvent such as dioxane. The R1 group may be introduced using an appropriate leaving group, for example halogen (such as bromide) or triflate, palladium catalyst and solvent using Suzuki coupling methodology as described above, to afford the desired products.

Reductive amination of 3,5-dibromopyrazin-2-amine E with ethyl 2-oxoacetate (in the presence of, for example, sodium borohydride as a reducing agent) affords intermediate L. Alternatively, 3,5-dibromopyrazin-2-amine E may be converted to intermediate L by reaction with ethyl 2-chloroacetate under basic conditions (using for example, CS2CO3). The R2 substituent is introduced through amine addition to L, in the presence of an amine base, such as diisopropylethylamine, and heating in an appropriate solvent (such as DMSO) and subsequent acid catalyzed ring closure (using, for example, acetic acid) to afford intermediate M. The ring closure of the amine addition product L may also proceed under basic catalyzed conditions, such as treatment with potassium t-butoxide in an appropriate solvent. Alternatively, the ethyl ester moiety can be hydrolyzed (for example by base treatment) prior to reaction with R2-NH2 in water, followed by acid catalyzed ring closure. As before, the R1 group may be introduced using the appropriate boronic acid or borate ester, palladium catalyst, solvent and base through a Suzuki coupling, or alternately with the appropriate stannane, palladium catalyst and solvent using Stille coupling methodology (described above) to afford the desired products.

H* TXT I'T'·n'T3 H P R1-B(OR*)2 or R1-Sn(R~)3 Scheme 8 [0087] An alternative approach (Scheme 8) begins with reaction of 2,6-dichloropyrazine N with the appropriate amino ester (RΛ is C1-3 alkyl), followed by reductive dehalogenation with hydrogen and a palladium catalyst such as palladium hydroxide, a base such as potassium carbonate, in a solvent such as ethanol, and subsequent bromination by reaction with a brominating agent such as NBS to yield intermediate O. As above, the R2 substituent is introduced through amine addition to O and subsequent acid catalyzed ring closure to afford intermediate P. The R1 group may be introduced using the appropriate boronic acid or borate ester, palladium catalyst, solvent and base through a Suzuki coupling, or alternately with the appropriate stannane, palladium catalyst and solvent using Stille coupling methodology to afford the desired products (described above). This route also allows for the synthesis of analogs with R3 substitution alpha to the carbonyl group. H Q2 Scheme 9 [0088] As before, to obtain the desired products, the reactivity of the coupling partners may be reversed (Scheme 9). For example, intermediate P may be converted to the corresponding stannane Q, and the R1 group may be introduced using an appropriate leaving group, for example halogen (such as bromide) or triflate, palladium catalyst and solvent using Stille coupling methodology as described above to afford the desired products. Alternatively, intermediate P may be converted to the corresponding boronate ester Q2, and the R1 group may be introduced using an appropriate leaving group, for example halogen (such as bromide) or triflate, palladium catalyst and solvent using Suzuki coupling methodology as described above to afford the desired products. [0089] Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the Heteroaryl Compounds can be formed by conventional and known techniques, such as by reacting a Heteroaryl Compound with a suitable acid as disclosed above. Such salts are typically formed in high yields at moderate temperatures, and often are prepared by merely isolating the compound from a suitable acidic wash in the final step of the synthesis. The salt-forming acid may dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent, or aqueous organic solvent, such as an alkanol, ketone or ester. On the other hand, if the Heteroaryl Compound is desired in the free base form, it may be isolated from a basic final wash step, according to known techniques. For example, a typical technique for preparing hydrochloride salt is to dissolve the free base in a suitable solvent, and diy the solution thoroughly, as over molecular sieves, before bubbling hydrogen chloride gas through it.

MS (ESI) m/z 340.0 [M]+ Note: As understood by one of skill in the art, protection, with for example Boc or THP groups, of heterocyclic moieties that are subject to tautomerism, for example triazolyl moieties, potentially may give rise to different regioisomerically protected compounds that may not readily be characterized or distinguished by standard analytical methods such as 1D-NMR. Such regioisomers are referred to herein specifically by the chemical name of only one of the regioisomers, however, it is understood that the name refers to any and all possible regioisomers and their mixtures potentially formed by the reaction. The single regioisomeric designation is thereafter also applied in the naming of the subsequent products formed by reaction with the protected intermediate. As understood by one of skill in the art, upon removal of the protecting group only one product is formed, independent of the starting regioisomerically protected compound.
