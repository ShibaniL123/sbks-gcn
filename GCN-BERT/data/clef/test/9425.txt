BIOMARKERS OF RESPONSE TO CYCLIN D - CDK4/6 TARGETED THERAPIES IN CANCER FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE [0001] The invention relates generally to biomarkers indicating response to CYCLIN D - CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy, and more specifically to genetic markers indicating sensitivity or resistance to treatment with palbociclib in cancer. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE [0002] Several cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors have been evaluated in cancer medicine without significant clinical activity. For example, palbociclib is a highly selective inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) that has been shown to inhibit growth of malignant cell lines in vitro and in vivo by preventing the phosphorylation of Rb and stopping the progression Gl/S of cell cycle. [0003] Clinical trials are currently underway with palbociclib as well as other CDK4/6 inhibitors and most of these trials have been designed as "biomarker-independent" in that there is no biomarker selection for trial inclusion. As a result, these trials may show little or no efficacy compared to those trials enriched for patients with genomic biomarkers of susceptibility to CDK4/6 inhibition. Thus, a need exists for validated biomarkers for identifying patients who may be uniquely sensitive to treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors across cancers of differing histologies.

[0069] As used herein, the term "unit dosage form" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human and animal subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of a compound of the disclosure calculated in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect, optionally in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent, carrier or vehicle. The specifications for the novel unit dosage forms of the present disclosure depend on the particular compound employed and the effect to be achieved, and the pharmacodynamics associated with each compound in the host. [0070] The term "antibody" is meant to include intact molecules of polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies, chimeric, single chain, and humanized antibodies, as well as fragments thereof, such as Fab and F(ab')2, Fv and SCA fragments which are capable of binding an epitopic determinant. Monoclonal antibodies are made from antigen containing fragments of the protein by methods well known to those skilled in the art (Kohler, et al., Nature, 256:495, 1975). An Fab fragment consists of a monovalent antigen-binding fragment of an antibody molecule, and can be produced by digestion of a whole antibody molecule with the enzyme papain, to yield a fragment consisting of an intact light chain and a portion of a heavy chain. A Fab' fragment of an antibody molecule can be obtained by treating a whole antibody molecule with pepsin, followed by reduction, to yield a molecule consisting of an intact light chain and a portion of a heavy chain. Two Fab' fragments are obtained per antibody molecule treated in this manner. An (Fab')2 fragment of an antibody can be obtained by treating a whole antibody molecule with the enzyme pepsin, without subsequent reduction. A (Fab')2 fragment is a dimer of two Fab' fragments, held together by two disulfide bonds. An Fv fragment is defined as a genetically engineered fragment containing the variable region of a light chain and the variable region of a heavy chain expressed as two chains. A single chain antibody ("SCA") is a genetically engineered single chain molecule containing the variable region of a light chain and the variable region of a heavy chain, linked by a suitable, flexible polypeptide linker. [0071] "Nucleic acid" or "oligonucleotide" or "polynucleotide" or grammatical equivalents used herein means at least two nucleotides covalently linked together. Nucleic acids are typically deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotides polymers (pure or mixed) in single-or double- stranded form. The term may encompass nucleic acids containing nucleotide analogs or modified backbone residues or linkages, which are synthetic, naturally occurring, and non-naturally occurring, which have similar binding, structural, or functional properties as the reference nucleic acid, and which are metabolized in a manner similar to the reference nucleotides. Non- limiting examples of such analogs include, without limitation, phosphorothioates, phosphoramidates, methyl phosphonates, chiral-methyl phosphonates, 2-0-methyl ribonucleotides, and peptide-nucleic acids (PNAs). A nucleic acid will generally contain phosphodiester bonds, although in some cases, nucleic acid analogs are included that may have at least one different linkage, e.g., phosphoramidate, phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, or O-methylphosphoroamidite linkages. The term nucleic acid may, in some contexts, be used interchangeably with gene, cDNA, mRNA, oligonucleotide, and polynucleotide. [0072] A particular nucleic acid sequence also encompasses conservatively modified variants thereof (such as degenerate codon substitutions) and complementary sequences, as well as the sequence explicitly indicated. Specifically, degenerate codon substitutions may be achieved by generating sequences in which the third ("wobble") position of one or more selected (or all) codons is substituted with mixed-base and/or deoxyinosine residues. Thus a nucleic acid sequence encoding a protein sequence disclosed herein also encompasses modified variants thereof as described herein. [0073] The terms "polypeptide", "peptide", and "protein" are typically used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. Amino acids may be referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-IUB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. [0074] As used herein, the terms "sample" and "biological sample" refer to any sample suitable for the methods provided by the present invention. In preferred embodiments, the sample contains nucleic acid and/or protein. In one embodiment, the biological sample of the present invention is a tissue sample, e.g., a biopsy specimen such as samples from needle biopsy, core needle biopsy or excisional biopsy (i.e., biopsy sample). In other embodiments, the biological sample of the present invention is a sample of bodily fluid, e.g., blood, serum, plasma, sputum, lung aspirate, or urine. [0075] As used herein, the term "amplification" when used in reference to a gene or amplicon means a log2(ratio) > 1, in other words, the amplification event results in at least twice as many copies of the gene or the amplicon. As used herein, the term "gain" typically refers to a low level increase in copy number (i.e., less than a 2- fold increase). [0076] Reference herein to "normal cells" or "corresponding normal cells" means cells that are from the same organ and of the same type as the cancer cell type. In one aspect, the corresponding normal cells comprise a sample of cells obtained from a healthy individual. Such corresponding normal cells can, but need not be, from an individual that is age-matched and/or of the same gender as the individual providing the cancer cells being examined. In another aspect, the corresponding normal cells comprise a sample of cells obtained from an otherwise healthy portion of tissue of a subject having cancer. In some embodiments of the present methods, the determination of a genomic gain is made by comparison of the genome from a cancer or tumor sample to a normal cell. [0077] Cancers [0078] It is contemplated that inhibitors of CDK4/6 or cyclin D are useful to treat cancers determined to be sensitive to treatment with a CDK4/6 or cyclin D inhibitor. It is contemplated that the methods herein identify cancers that are sensitive or resistant to CDK4/6 and/or cyclin D inhibitors.

In some embodiments, the cancer is selected from the group consisting of melanoma, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, triple negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer and lung cancer. [0079] Breast Cancer [0080] The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family consists of four homologous receptors: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/HER1), HER2, HER3, and HER4. All are transmembrane glycoproteins, but HER2 has no known ligand and HER3 has a nonfunctioning kinase. HER2 overexpression and/or amplification has been detected in 20% to 27% of invasive breast cancers and correlates with poorer clinical outcomes. [0081] Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) refers to any breast cancer that does not express the genes for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and Her2/neu. The lack of these markers makes it more difficult to treat since most chemotherapies target one of the three receptors, so triple-negative cancers often require combinatorial therapies. TNBC are sometimes classified into "basal-type" and other cancers. Basal type cancers are frequently defined by cytokeratin 5/6 and EGFR staining. About 75% of basal-type breast cancers are triple negative. Some TNBC overexpress epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) while some TNBC over expresses transmembrane glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB). [0082] Melanoma [0083] Malignant melanoma (MM) has long been considered a single histologic entity with heterogeneous clinical phenotypes. Evaluations of sun damage, mutations (y-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog Bl [BRAF], neuroblastoma RAS viral (y-ras) oncogene homolog [NRAS], and y-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog [CKFT]), and gene polymorphisms (melanocortin 1 receptor [MC1R]) indicate that melanoma is actually composed of distinct clinical and molecular entities driven by various oncogenic events (Tap et al, Neoplasia. 2010; 12(8): 637-649; Curtin et al.,N Engl J Med. 2005;353:2135-2147; Curtin et al. ,J Clin Oncol. 2006;24:4340-4346; Landi et al., Science. 2006;313:521-522). The identification of these molecular alterations permits the development of targeted therapies tailored to the specific pathway lesions of individual tumors. Mixed clinical outcome for therapies emphasizes the diverse nature of melanoma, questions its dependence on single "oncogenic" events, and demonstrates the complexity inherent to and of targeting molecular pathways. [0084] The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis and propagation of melanoma because of mutations in transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (CKIT 3%-5%), membrane-associated guanine nucleotide binding proteins (NRAS 15%-20%), and cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases (BRAF 60%-75%). Collectively, the effect of these aberrant signaling mediators is the steady- state activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) observed in 90% of melanomas (Cohen et al., Clin Cancer Res. 2002;8:3728-3733; Gray-Schopfer et al., Nature. 2007;445:851-857). Regardless of the causative upstream event, ERK overexpression promotes the differentiation, malignant transformation, proliferation, and survival of MM. Specific to ERK activation in BRAF mutated melanoma, as opposed to RTK mediated ERK activation, is its resistance to negative feedback inhibition from the dual specific phosphatases (DUSP) and sprouty family (SPRY) of RAF binding proteins (Pratilas et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2009;106:4519-4524). Also, the presence of a BRAF (B-RAF) mutation (BRAFm) seems to evoke downstream transcriptional activity of ERK through MYC, FOS-like antigen 1 (FOSL1), and the ETS family of transcription factors. Activation of the phosphoinositide- 3 -kinase (PI3K) pathway is documented in more than 70% of MM (Kantrow et all. J Cutan Pathol. 2007;34:593-596). Synergistic activity of BRAF and v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT) has been implicated in the pathogenesis and malignant transformation of melanoma (Cheung et al., Cancer Res. 2008;68:3429-3439; Dankort et al., Nat Genet. 2009;41:544-552). [0085] In various embodiments, the disclosure provides a method for treating a subject having melanoma that is sensitive to a CDK4 inhibitor, CDK6 inhibitor, or cyclin D inhibitor comprising identifying a subject having a CDK4 inhibitor-, CDK6 inhibitor-, or cyclin D inhibitor- sensitive melanoma and administering a CDK4 inhibitor, CDK6 inhibitor, or cyclin D inhibitor.

In various embodiments, the CDK4 inhibitor-, CDK6 inhibitor-, or cyclin D inhibitor- sensitive melanoma does not comprise i) activation of SHH; ii) overexpression of the SMO gene; iii) overexpression of the GL12 gene; or iv) combinations of i), ii) and iii). In various embodiments, a CDK4 inhibitor-, CDK6 inhibitor-, or cyclin D inhibitor- sensitive melanoma comprises i) activation of SHH; ii) overexpression of the SMO gene; iii) overexpression of the GL12 gene; or iv) combinations of i), ii) and iii). [0086] Colon Cancer [0087] Colon cancer typically originates from the epithelial cells lining the colon of the gastrointestinal tract. Certain mutations have been linked to colon cancer, including mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway that increase signaling activity. Other mutations that have been noted in colon cancers include p53 mutations and BAX mutations. Zhao et al., (World J Gastroenterol. 2003 Oct;9(10):2202-6) disclosed that immuno staining of pl6 was a predictor for better prognosis whereas strong cytoplasmic immuno staining of CDK4 was a predictor for poor prognosis. Certain studies have shown that administration of CDK4/6 inhibitor LY2835219 to patients has been beneficial in colon cancer. [0088] In various embodiments, the disclosure contemplates a method for treating a subject having colon cancer that is sensitive to a CDK4 inhibitor, CDK6 inhibitor, or cyclin D inhibitor comprising identifying a subject having a CDK4 inhibitor-, CDK6 inhibitor-, or cyclin D inhibitor- sensitive colon cancer and administering a CDK4 inhibitor, CDK6 inhibitor, or cyclin D inhibitor. In various embodiments, the CDK4 inhibitor-, CDK6 inhibitor-, or cyclin D inhibitor- sensitive colon cancer comprises i); high pl6 protein; ii) copy number amplification of RBI; or iii) combinations of i) and ii). [0089] In various embodiments, the CDK4 inhibitor-, CDK6 inhibitor-, or cyclin D inhibitor- sensitive colon cancer does not comprise i) loss-of-function mutations in FBXW7, ii) point mutations in RET; iii) CCNE1 copy number amplifications, iv) or combinations of any of i), ii) or iii).

[0092] Assays [0093] Malignant tissue specimens of cancers from individual patients or circulating tumor cells could be tested for the presence of alterations in the relevant predictive genes biomarkers of sensitivity/resistance by any of the methods listed above. If the types of alterations listed in this disclosure are found to be present, these patients could be considered as appropriate or inappropriate candidates to receive CDK4 and/or CDK6 or Cyclin D-inhibitor based therapies as part of the treatment regimen for their malignancy. [0094] The in vitro response biomarkers described herein can be translated for use in the clinical setting via genotyping the patient tumor samples for each particular alteration. The assays used to perform this genotyping would differ by alteration type. Copy number alterations can be assayed by several techniques including (but not limited to) SNP arrays, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), southern blot analysis, florescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) or chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) in order to detect increases in DNA copy number at these loci. To detect the alterations at the RNA level, this would include (but not be limited to) techniques such as transcript expression arrays, RNA in situ hybridization, northern blot analysis, transcript enumeration via direct exon/transcript sequencing (e.g. Illumina sequencing platforms) in order to detect increases in mRNA expression of the gene transcripts. To detect the alterations at the protein level, this would include (but not be limited to) techniques such as protein arrays (e.g. ELISAs, Multiplex (MSD), reverse phase protein analysis-RPPA or western blot analysis of cell or tissue lysates/extracts, etc.) immunohistochemical staining analyses of tissue sections for the presence of the target proteins, or any antibody-based methodology directed at detecting increases in protein expression of the target proteins. Point mutations can be assayed directly by Sanger sequencing, or next-generation array based methods such as hybrid capture. Point mutations may also be assayed indirectly at the mRNA or protein level if the alteration leads to instability of the mRNA transcript or degradation of the resulting protein. [0095] Additional assays are described in the Examples section. [0096] The biomarkers identified in the assays are referred to be their common name known in the literature and can be identified using literature or other common scientific resources. [0097] Formulations [0098] The disclosure provides CDK4/6 and cyclin D inhibitors useful in the treatment of cancer (e.g., to inhibit or suppress growth of or metastasis of a tumor). To administer inhibitors to patients or test animals, it is preferable to formulate the products in a composition comprising one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Pharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable carriers or vehicles refer to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce allergic, or other adverse reactions when administered using routes well-known in the art, as described below, or are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or a counterpart foreign regulatory authority as an acceptable additive to orally or parenterally administered pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include any and all clinically useful solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. [0099] Pharmaceutical carriers include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, particularly where a basic or acidic group is present in a compound. For example, when an acidic substituent, such as — COOH, is present, the ammonium, sodium, potassium, calcium and the like salts, are contemplated for administration. Additionally, where an acid group is present, pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the compound (e.g. , methyl, tert-butyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, succinyl, and the like) are contemplated as preferred forms of the compounds, such esters being known in the art for modifying solubility and/or hydrolysis characteristics for use as sustained release or prodrug formulations. [0100] When a basic group (such as amino or a basic heteroaryl radical, such as pyridyl) is present, then an acidic salt, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, acetate, maleate, pamoate, phosphate, methanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and the like, is contemplated as a form for administration. [0101] In addition, compounds may form solvates with water or common organic solvents. Such solvates are contemplated as well. [0102] The inhibitors herein may be administered orally, parenterally, transocularly, intranasally, transdermally, transmucosally, by inhalation spray, vaginally, rectally, or by intracranial injection. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intracisternal injection, or infusion techniques. Administration by intravenous, intradermal, intramusclar, intramammary, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, retrobulbar, intrapulmonary injection and or surgical implantation at a particular site is contemplated as well. Generally, compositions for administration by any of the above methods are essentially free of pyrogens, as well as other impurities that could be harmful to the recipient. Further, compositions for administration parenterally are sterile. [0103] Inhibitors contemplated herein include, but are not limited to CDK4/6 and cyclin D inhibitors palbociclib, LY2835219, and LEE011. [0104] Dosing and Administration [0105] The CDK4/6 or cyclin D inhibitor is administered in a therapeutically effective amount; typically, the composition is in unit dosage form. The amount of inhibitor administered is, of course, dependent on the age, weight, and general condition of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the judgment of the prescribing- physician. Suitable therapeutic amounts will be known to those skilled in the art and/or are described in the pertinent reference texts and literature. In one aspect, the dose is administered either one time per day or multiple times per day. The CDK4/6 or cyclin D inhibitor may be administered one, two, three or four times per day. In some embodiments, an effective dosage of inhibitor may be within the range of 0.01 mg to 1000 mg per kg (mg/kg) of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the inhibitor is administered at a daily dose ranging from about 10 mg/kg to about 250 mg/kg, or from about 100 mg/kg to about 250 mg/kg, or from about 60 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg or from about 50 mg/kg to about 90 mg/kg, or from about 30 mg/kg to about 80 mg/kg, or from about 20 mg/kg to about 60 mg/kg, or from about 10 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg. Further, the effective amount or dose may be 0.5 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg/ 25 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 35 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, 45 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, 55 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 70 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, 80 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, 125 mg/kg, 150 mg/kg, 175 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg, 350 mg/kg, 400 mg/kg, 450 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, and may increase by 25 mg/kg increments up to 1000 mg/kg, or may range between any two of the foregoing values. [0106] Administration may continue for at least 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, 2 years, or more. [0107] Combination Therapy [0108] Therapeutic compositions described herein can be administered in therapeutically effective dosages alone or in combination with adjunct cancer therapy such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, thermotherapy, and laser therapy, and may provide a beneficial effect, e.g. reducing tumor size, slowing rate of tumor growth, inhibiting metastasis, or otherwise improving overall clinical condition, without necessarily eradicating the cancer. Cytostatic and cytotoxic agents that target the cancer cells are specifically contemplated for combination therapy. Likewise, agents that target angiogenesis or lymphangiogenesis are specifically contemplated for combination therapy. [0109] Traditional approaches to the design of combination therapeutic regimens have involved adding a new drug to an already established regimen, assuming that there is no increased toxicity caused by integrating the new drug. It is contemplated that a CDK4/6 or cyclin D inhibitor can be used in combination with an already established standard of care for a particular cancer, or in another combination regimen. The present methods may also indicate that a CDK4/6 or cyclin D inhibitor is contraindicated in combination therapy with a standard of care treatment if the cancer is determined to be resistant to a CDK4/6 or cyclin D inhibitor.

[0115] While the disclosure has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, the foregoing description as well as the examples which follow are intended to illustrate and not limit the scope of the disclosure. Other aspects, advantages and modifications within the scope of the disclosure will be apparent to those skilled in the art. [0116] Methods: [0117] A cell line panel consisting of more than 600 human cancer cell lines derived from actual individual patient malignancies representing a broad spectrum of common human cancers that include 15 separate histologic subtypes, e.g. breast, ovary, lung, colorectal, gastric, melanoma, pancreas, etc. has been collected and comprehensively characterized. Specifically, this panel has been characterized with regard to the individual cell line's ability to grow in vitro both on plastic and in soft agar, as well as to grow in vivo subcutaneously and ortho-topically. In addition, each cell line in the panel has been characterized molecularly for gene expression by transcript microarray as well as gene copy number variation (CNV), and for many cell lines, by proteomic and biochemical pathway analyses. Finally, the majority of these cells have also been characterized for their response to standard chemotherapeutic/cytotoxic agents and where appropriate, hormonal or biologic agents. Using this characterized panel, preclinical, growth inhibition studies may be performed with various new potential therapeutics or novel combinations of therapeutics to determine which lines and/or histologies do or do not respond to the therapeutic intervention being assessed. [0118] Using this research platform the present inventors have completed studies with palbociclib (i.e., PD-0332991), a novel cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor. While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that blocking CDK 4/6 in cancer cells will inhibit the cell cycle at the Gl/S transition by preventing the phosphorylation of the Rb gene product by the Cyclin D: CDK 4/6 enzyme complex. [0119] The present inventors investigated potential molecular determinants of response to palbociclib in additional cancer types. As provided herein, the in vitro sensitivity to palbociclib was assayed across a panel of 470 cancer cell lines derived from 13 distinct cancer histologies. This analysis demonstrated a highly differential response to treatment both within and between cancer histologies. The IC50s (the concentration of palbociclib required to inhibit 50% of population doublings) ranged from the low nanomolar range to above the highest dose tested (ΙμΜ). The generation of this highly differential response dataset allowed for a unique opportunity to explore the possible genetic mechanisms underlying differential sensitivity to treatment with palbociclib in vitro (which may help identify new and/or additional novel therapeutic targets) while at the same time allowing the identification of potential predictive biomakers of sensitivity and resistance. [0120] Using this approach, two large genomic datasets were interrogated for genotype- response associations. The first dataset consisted of whole exome point mutation data downloaded from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia's hybrid capture sequencing database. This database was restricted by various criteria to enrich for functional, somatic point mutations that are known to be causally involved in carcinogenesis. From this restricted dataset two proto- oncogenes (RET, SMO) were identified where presumptive "activating" mutations that were associated with resistance to treatment with palbociclib within the interrogated cell line panel. [0121] As provided herein, eight recessive cancer genes where likely "loss-of-function" point mutations were significantly associated with palbociclib response were also identified. Mutations in one of these genes (CDHl) was associated with palbociclib sensitivity, while mutations in the seven other genes (RBI, FBXW7, FANCA, NBN, PMS2, STK11, MUTYH) were associated with resistance to the drug. [0122] The second large genomic dataset that was interrogated for genotype-response associations was a copy number alteration dataset derived from comparative genomic hybridization arrays. This dataset was organized by gene and also restricted by various criteria to enrich for amplifications or deletions of genes likely to be causally involved in oncogenesis and/or tumor progression. From this dataset three chromosomal regions were identified (17ql2- 21, l lql3, lq) where amplification was associated with sensitivity to palbociclib. Two amplified regions (19ql2, 8ql3) were found to be associated with resistance to the drug. Homozygous deletions of the 13ql4 chromosomal region were found to be strongly associated with resistance to palbociclib. [0123] Following the identification of these candidate palbociclib response biomarkers from the above screens, several analyses were performed to further validate causation for each of these genotype-response associations. These analyses included: a comprehensive literature search to investigate potential causal mechanisms for each identified biomarker; a Pearson correlation analysis to identify inter-biomarker associations followed by multiple regression to isolate the independent effect of each variable; a control of confounding variables by cell line growth rate and histology; and an analysis of misclassification in the genomics datasets. Using these extensive post-hoc analyses, the original set of fifteen biomarkers was reduced down to the eight most likely to play a causal role in determining sensitivity or resistance to treatment with palbociclib. The set of sensitivity biomarkers includes: loss-of-function point mutations in CDH1, chromosomal amplification of 17ql2-21 (ERBB2), chromosomal amplification of l lql3 (CCND1) and chromosomal amplification of lq (MDM4). The set of resistance biomarkers includes: an activating point mutation of the smoothened (SMO) gene, an activating point mutation of the RET proto-oncogene, a chromosomal amplification of 19ql2 (CCNE1), a loss- of-function point mutation of FBXW7, a loss-of-function point mutation of retinoblastoma (RBI), a chromosomal deletion of RBI, a chromosomal amplification of sonic hedgehog (SHH), high baseline GLI2 mRNA expression, and high baseline SMO mRNA expression. [0124] The above sets of biomarkers were analyzed by strata representing each of the twelve cancer types contained in the cell line panel. The four sensitivity biomarkers were sufficiently frequent and associated with sensitivity in 6 of 12 cancer types in our panel. These included breast, colon, head/neck, lung, ovarian and upper gastrointestinal malignancies. The resistance biomarkers were sufficiently frequent and associated with resistance in 6 of the 12 cancer types in our panel, which included breast, colon, kidney, lung, ovarian and upper gastrointestinal malignancies. [0125] The in vitro response biomarkers described above can be translated for use in the clinical setting via genotyping the patient tumor samples for each particular alteration. The assays used to perform this genotyping would differ by alteration type. Copy number alterations can be assayed by several techniques including (but are not limited to) SNP arrays, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), southern blot analysis or florescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) in order to detect increases in DNA copy number at these loci. To detect the alterations at the RNA level, this would include (but not be limited to) techniques such as transcript expression arrays, RNA in situ hybridization, real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), northern blot analysis, transcript enumeration via direct exon/transcript sequencing (e.g. Lumina sequencing platforms) in order to detect increases in mRNA expression of the gene transcripts. To detect the alterations at the protein level, this would include (but not be limited to) techniques such as protein arrays (e.g. ELISAs, Multiplex (MSD), reverse phase protein analysis-RPPA or western blot analysis of cell or tissue lysates/extracts, etc.) immunohistochemical staining analyses of tissue sections for the present of the target proteins, or any antibody-based methodology directed at detecting increases in protein expression of the target proteins. Point mutations can be assayed directly by Sanger sequencing, or next-generation array based methods such as hybrid capture. Point mutations may also be assayed indirectly at the mRNA or protein level if the alteration leads to instability of the mRNA transcript or degradation of the resulting protein. [0126] Malignant tissue specimens of cancers from individual patients or circulating tumor cells could be tested for the presence of alterations in the relevant predictive genes biomarkers of sensitivity/resistance by any of the methods listed above. If the types of alterations listed in this disclosure are found to be present, these patients could be considered as appropriate or inappropriate candidates to receive CDK4/6-inhibitor based therapies as part of the treatment regimen for their malignancy. [0127] While the disclosure has been described with reference to the above and to Attachments 1 and 2, which are incorporated herein by reference (see Examples 1-3 and Figures 1-16), it will be understood that it is capable of further modifications. This application is intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the disclosure following, in general, the disclosed principles and including such departures from the disclosure as come within known or customary practice within the art to which the disclosure pertains and as may be applied to the essential features hereinbefore set forth. Accordingly, the invention is limited only by the following claims. EXAMPLES Example 1 Identification of Genomic Predictors of Response to the CDK4/6 Inhibitor Palbociclib using the UCLATORL Panel of Human Cancer Cell Lines [0128] Palbociclib is a highly specific small molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 currently in clinical development by Pfizer. It is designed to inhibit the cell cycle at the Gl/S transition via preventing the phosphorylation of Rb by the Cyclin D/CDK4/6 enzyme complex. Our lab previously identified the estrogen receptor positive subpopulation of breast cancer patients as distinctively likely to benefit from treatment with palbociclib. This observation spurred the initiation of a Phase II clinical trial in this patient population where remarkable efficacy was observed. Given this translational success, we wished to investigate the molecular determinants of response to palbociclib in several additional cancer types. [0129] To this end, we assayed the in vitro sensitivity to palbociclib across a panel of 416 cancer cell lines derived from 12 distinct cancer types. We observed highly differential response to treatment both within and between cancer types. IC50s (the concentration of palbociclib required to inhibit fifty percent of population doublings) ranged from the low nanomolar range to above the highest dose tested (1(JM). This response distribution was much broader than was observed in similar screens performed by the Broad and Sanger institutes, where the vast majority of cell lines assayed were listed as having IC50s above luM. Our ability to identify a higher proportion of palbociclib-sensitive cell lines can likely be credited to methodological innovations aimed at optimizing our screening protocol for the detection of longer-term cytostatic effects, as opposed to shorter-term cytotoxic effects of treatment. The generation of this highly differential response dataset allowed for a unique opportunity to explore the possible genetic mechanisms underlying differential sensitivity to treatment with palbociclib in vitro. [0130] The other dataset interrogated for genotype-response associations was a copy number alteration dataset derived from comparative genomic hybridization arrays. This dataset was organized by gene and also restricted by various criteria to enrich for amplifications or deletions of genes likely to be causally involved in carcinogenesis. From this dataset we identified three chromosomal regions (17ql2-21, l lql3, lq32) where amplification was associated with sensitivity to palbociclib. Two amplified regions (19ql3, 8ql3) were found to be associated with resistance. Homozygous deletions of the 13ql4 chromosomal region were found to be strongly associated with resistance to palbociclib. [0131] Following these extensive post-hoc analyses, we pruned our original set of fourteen biomarkers down to the eight most likely to play a causal role in determining sensitivity or resistance to treatment with palbociclib. The final set of candidate sensitivity biomarkers included: loss-of-function point mutations in CDH1, loss-of-function point mutations in TOPBP1, chromosomal amplification of 17ql2-21 (ERBB2) and chromosomal amplification of l lql3 (CCND1). The final set of candidate resistance biomarkers included: activating point mutations in SMO, chromosomal amplification of CCNE1, loss-of-function point mutations in RBI and chromosomal deletion of 13ql4 (RBI) (Figure 1 to Figure 11) [0132] This final set of eight candidate biomarkers was analyzed by strata representing each of the 12 cancer types in our cell line panel. The four candidate sensitivity biomarkers were sufficiently frequent and associated with sensitivity in 6 of the 12 cancer types in our panel. These were the breast, colon, head/neck, lung, ovarian and upper gastrointestinal strata. The four candidate resistance biomarkers were sufficiently frequent and associated with resistance in 6 of the 12 cancer types in our panel. These were the breast, colon, kidney, lung, ovarian and upper gastrointestinal strata. Example 2 Identification of markers of sensitivity and resistance to palbociclib (PD0332991) in melanoma [0133] Melanoma, a malignancy originating in pigment-producing melanocytes, is generally resistant to conventional treatments such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Molecular targeted therapeutics against BRAF and MEK have shown marked efficacy for patients with metastatic melanoma. However these targeted therapies have a limited duration of response. Palbociclib is a highly selective inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) that has been shown to inhibit growth of malignant cell lines in vitro and in vivo by preventing the phosphorylation of Rb and stopping the progression Gl/S of cell cycle. The Cyclin D-CDK4/6-Rb axis has been shown to be dysregulated in 85-90% of melanomas and may represent a new therapeutic target. Our main goal in this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of palbociclib in a large panel of human melanoma cell lines to identify potential biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance. [0134] Material and Methods: We evaluated the response palbociclib treatment in 48 melanoma cell lines. A comprehensive biomarker screen was performed using mutation and gene expression (Agilent) data. The mechanism of action of the drug, phospho-Rb and senescence, was investigated by western blot (WB) analysis. Effects on the cell cycle and apoptosis were study by flow cytometry. [0135] Results: A marked differential response to palbociclib was observed across the melanoma cell lines with IC50s ranging from 28nM to over 1 μΜ. A subset (14/48) of cell lines were classified as sensitive at clinically achievable concentrations (IC50<150nM). BRAF and NRAS activating mutation did not correlate with sensitivity in vitro. Increased expression of genes correlating with cyclin D-CDK4/6 activation strongly predicted for palbociclib sensitivity. We also found that genomic and expression markers of activation of the hedgehog/smoothened (SHH) pathway strongly predicted for in vitro resistance to palbociclib (Figures 12-14). These markers included chromosomal amplification of SHH, and high baseline expression of SMO and GLI2 (Figures 15-16). Protein analysis by Western blot showed a dramatic decrease in phospho- Rb protein only in sensitive cell lines and also it caused a decrease in FOXMl protein, indicating palbociclib may partially act by inducing senescence in treated cells. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed that palbociclib induces a strong Gl/S arrest, but not significant apoptosis. [0136] Conclusion: Nearly 30% of the melanoma cell lines evaluated were found to be sensitive to palbociclib in vitro. Response to palbociclib did not correlate with BRAF and NRAS mutational status. A gene expression signature for CDK 4/6 activation successfully identified those cell lines most sensitive to palbociclib. We also identified markers of hedgehog/smoothened/GLI activation that strongly predicted for resistance to palbociclib. These data support the development of CDK 4/6 inhibitors in melanoma and provide a hypothesis for patient enrichment in clinical trials. [0137] Additional studies were undertaken on sensitive and resistant melanoma cell lines. Cell lines representative of the spectrum of sensitivities were cultured in the presence of ΙΟΟηΜ palbociclib for 72 hours and stained with DAPI for cell cycle analysis. Most of the cell lines showed a G0-G1 arrest after palbociclib treatment. This arrest was more prominent on the sensitive cells lines (Figure 17). Effects of palbociclib treatment on FoxMl, RB, CDK4 and CDK6 protein expression. M14 (sensitive) and A375 (resistant) cells were exposed for 30min, 24 and 48hrs to media control or ΙΟΟηΜ palbociclib. Western blot analysis showed a decrease on phospho-Rb protein in sensitive cells. Decrease of FoxMl is associated with cellular senescence, palbociclib treatment caused a decrease in this protein only in sensitive cells. [0138] To explore the functional relevance of GLI2 expression in palbociclib resistant cell lines CHL-1 (Figure 18A) and M233 (Figure 18B), knockdown studies were performed using siRNA. Palbociclib sensitive cells M296 (Figure 18C) was used as a control. Total cell number (left panels) and percent inhibition were assessed (right panels). Reduction of GLI2, assessed by Western Blot, significantly reduced the cell growth proliferation, confirming the SMO/GLI2 cell cycle dependency, instead of CDK-4/6 -Cyclin D pathway. [0139] Effects of palbociclib treatment on resistance cells in combination with GLI2 siRNA knockdown on cell lines expressing high GLI2 protein levels was determined. GLI2 was knocked down and palbociclib was added at two different doses ΙΟΟηΜ and 250nM. Assessment on the cell growth proliferation after 6 days of treatment showed a potentiation in the inhibition of the cell growth proliferation (Figure 19A and 19B). [0140] These results indicate that Smoothened and CDK-4/6 inhibitors have the potential to have a synergistic effect in the clinic. Exemplary inhibitors of Smoothened include GDC-0449, cyclopamine, itraconazole, LDE225, IPI-926 and vismodegib (Erivedge). Example 3 Expression of pl6 in colon cancer and cyclin Dl in gastric cancer predicts response to CDK4/6 inhibition in vitro [0141] Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a significant role in regulating cell cycle progression through association with cyclins. CDK4 and CDK6 interact with cyclin Dl to mediate hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma (Rb) during early Gl phase. Palbociclib is a highly selective inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 which functions by blocking pRb phosphorylation resulting in Gi arrest in sensitive cell lines. We evaluated the effect of palbociclib in gastric and colon cancer cell lines to explore potential biomarkers of response and to guide patient selection in colon and gastric cancer. [0142] Methods: Panels of 17 gastric and 27 colon cancer cell lines were exposed in vitro to palbociclib over various concentrations to generate dose response curves. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to identify differentially expressed genes between sensitive and resistant cell lines. Genes identified by ANOVA and effects of palbociclib on pRB were analyzed via western blot. [0143] Results: Palbociclib was found to have potent anti-proliferative activity in the low nanomolar range (<150 nM) for 14 of the 44 gastric and colon cancer cell lines tested. In gastric cancer, cyclin Dl -amplified cells expressed greater sensitivity to the compound when compared to cyclin Dl -negative cells. HER2 amplified cell lines were also statistically more sensitive than HER2 negative cells. Furthermore, cyclin E emerged as a biomarker for resistance to the compound in gastric cancers. Contrary to observations made in other cancers, expression levels of pl6 (CDK4 inhibitor) and p21 (CDK2 inhibitor) in colon cancer indicated that pi6 loss and p21 gain predict for resistance rather than sensitivity to CDK4 and CDK6 inhibition. [0144] Conclusions: Palbociclib demonstrates anti-proliferative activity in several gastric and colon cancer cell lines. Molecular markers found to predict for sensitivity to this agent enhance patient selection for future clinical studies of palbociclib. [0145] Additional studies were undertaken to determine the effects of palbociclib in gastric and colon cancer cell lines. To evaluate the combination of palbociclib and trastuzumab, two HER2-amplified gastric cancer cell lines (OE19 and NCI-N87) were treated with various doses. When these two agents were combined, significant synergy was observed in both HER2- amplified cell lines (Figure 20A and 20B). Mean combination indices (CI) were obtained ranging from 0.14 + 0.06 in NCI-N87 to 0.69 + 0.04 in OE19. [0146] Analysis of variance (ANOVA) identified differential gene expression levels of both pl6 (CDK4 inhibitor) and p21 (CDK2 inhibitor) in colon and gastric cancer cells. Contrary to observations made in other cancers, loss of pl6 (CDKN2A) in colon and gastric cancer as well as gain of p21(CDKNlA) in colon lines predict for resistance rather than sensitivity to CDK4 and CDK6 inhibition in vitro. [0147] The effects of palbociclib on select markers downstream of CDK4 and CDK6 proteins was examined in both sensitive (SW480 and MKN74) and resistant (HCT8 and MKN1) gastric and colon cell lines. There was time-dependent inhibition of Rb phosphorylation and decreased expression of total Rb after treatment with palbociclib which was more pronounced in the sensitive lines (SW480 and MKN74). [0148] Cell cycle analysis was used to compare the sensitive and resistant gastric and colon cancer cell lines. In the cells that were sensitive to the anti-proliferative effects of palbociclib (SW480 and NUGC4), palbociclib induced a potent G1/G0 arrest at both 24-hour and 48-hour time points. In contrast, in the resistant lines cell lines (RKO and MKN1), there was a minimal effect (Figures 21A-B and Figures 22A-B). [0149] These results how that similar to observations made in breast cancer, gastric and colon cancer Cyclin D-amplified cells typically expressed greater sensitivity to palbociclib. In gastric cancer cell lines, those that were HER2-amplified were particularly sensitive to palbociclib and had a synergistic effect with trastuzumab. ANOVA analysis of baseline gene expression identified pl6 loss (in both colon and gastric lines) and p21 gain (in colon) as potential predictors for resistance to palbociclib. Clinical trials combining CDK 4/6 inhibitors with trastuzumab in HER2 amplified cancers are ongoing. Molecular markers found to predict for sensitivity to this agent enhance patient selection for future clinical studies of palbociclib 1.
