RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is the National Stage of International Patent Application No. PCT/CN2010/000687, filed on May 14, 2010, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the field of medical chemistry. Specifically, the present invention relates to an acrylamide compound and a pharmaceutical composition thereof. The present invention further relates to use of a urea compound and a pharmaceutical composition thereof for anti-apoptosis, prophylaxis or treatment of a disease or disorder associated with apoptosis, especially for protecting myocardial cells and for prophylaxis or treatment of a disease or disorder associated with apoptosis of myocardial cells. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Apoptosis usually refers to programmed cell death of body cells occurred via the regulation of intracellular genes and products thereof during development process or under the action of some factors. Apoptosis commonly exists in biosphere under both physiological state and pathological state. It plays important roles in embryo development and morphogenesis, stability of normal cells in tissues, defense and immune reaction of body, cell damage caused by diseases or poisoning, ageing, generation and development of tumors, and is one of the hottest spots in biomedical research. Some researches show that the occurrence of many serious diseases relates to the over apoptosis of cells, for example, the reduction of CD4+ T cells during the development of ADIS; the cell death mediated by cytotoxic T cell during transplant rejection reaction; the apoptosis of myocardial cells and nerve cells of ischemia and reperfusion injury; nervous system degradation diseases (such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson's disease, etc.); apoptosis caused by exposure to ionizing radiation in many tissues. Some evidences have indicated that cardiomyocytes apoptosis closely associates with the occurrence, development and prognosis of many heart diseases. It is found in the research about cardiomyocytes apoptosis that the infarct of cardiac muscle is not equivalent to myocardial necrosis, and apoptosis is one of mechanisms of myocardial infarction, and is the main manner of myocardial death of early infarction and myocardial death caused by ischemia/reperfusion, and the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in large amount at this time aggravates myocardial damage. In 1989, Nepomniashchikh et al found in the observation of ultrastructure of hunger myocardial atrophy that the synthesis of cardiomyocytes structural protein decreased, and the cell number decreased but was not accompanied with a proportional decrease of cell nucleus, an thus preliminarily proposed that hunger myocardial atrophy was caused by apoptosis. In 1994, Gottlieb and Kawano et al obtained direct evidences of cardiomyocytes apoptosis by using electron microscope in combination with DNA gel electrophoresis, in which the former disclosed reperfusion injury induced rabbit cardiomyocytes apoptosis, and the latter confirmed that myocarditis patients had concomitant cardiomyocytes apoptosis. Tanaka et al also confirmed the existence of apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in suckling mice. With the progress of methodology and research of apoptosis, pathological functions of cardiomyocytes apoptosis have been found in many heart diseases. Some researches indicate the heart injury in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) is relevant to apoptosis; the conversion from cardiac pachynsis to heart failure in advanced stage is caused by cardiomyocytes apoptosis; acute myocardial infarction also induces apoptosis in early stage of infarction and reperfusion injury, except necrosis; cardiomyocytes apoptosis is also found in transplanted heart and right ventricular maldevelopment myocardial diseases, and anoxia also induces cardiomyocytes apoptosis. Apoptosis has recoverability in some extents, and the apoptosis in myocardial infarction and ischemia/reperfusion has its own features and regular patterns, so that the features may be used for prevention and reduction of apoptosis and may provide enlightenments for clinical prophylaxis of ischemia/reperfusion injury; during the process of reperfusion, the apoptosis occurred in contraction band region (around infarction site) is induced by some precipitating factors, so that the inhibition factors of apoptosis such as drugs may be used for preventing apoptosis and treating corresponding diseases caused by apoptosis. However, there are few kinds and numbers of drugs so far that can be clinically used for anti-apoptosis and protecting cells, and their selectivity and targeting property are not satisfied, and therefore it is of great significance to continuously develop new, safe and effective drugs for anti-apoptosis and protecting cells, and especially drugs with a novel mechanism of action.

This solution was prepared when using. 3) 1× penetrating membrane solution: 4 mL of 10× penetrating membrane solution was added to 36 mL of ultrapure water, this application solution was stored at 4° C. for 7 days. 4) Mitotracker/Hoechst solution (stored at −20° C.): Mitotracker CMXROS was dissolved with 94 μL of anhydrous DMSO to obtain 1 mM solution, this solution could be preserved at −20° C. under dry and dark condition for 6 months. In order to avoid multiple freeze-thaw cycles, it was subpackaged in an amount for single use. 5.5 μL of 1 mM Mitotracker Red Solution and 11 μL of Hoechst dye were added to cell culture medium, to obtain an application solution with a final volume of 5.5 mL. This application solution should be prepared when using. 5) Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin solution: Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin was dissolved with 140 μL of methanol to form a mother liquor, this solution could be preserved at −20° C. under dry and dark condition for 12 months. 27.5 μL of the Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin mother liquor was added to 5.5 mL of 1× Wash Buffer to prepare an application solution. This application solution should be prepared when using. Experimental Method: Cardiomyocyte was obtained by primary culture according to Example 18, cell density 104/mL, each wall was added with 100 μL of suspension of the cells. The cells were incubated at 37° C., 5% CO2 environment for 96 h (replacing solution once per 48 h). After primary culture for 4 days, cell apoptosis was induced by placing in an anoxia incubator, the compounds of the present invention at different concentrations were added for pretreatment 30 min before inducing cell apoptosis, then placed in 37° C., 5% CO2-95% N2 incubator and cultured for 15.5 h. It was 30 min before the compound incubation finished, 50 μL of culture medium, 50 μL of Mitotracker/Hoechst solution, were added, and the cells were then continuously cultured at 37° C., 5% CO2-95% N2 for 30 min. Each well was directly added with 100 μL of fixing solution, without sucking out the culture medium, incubated at room temperature in fume cupboard for 10 min. The pre-heated fixing solution was very important for keeping cell integrity. The solution of each well was sucked out (the plate could be turned over), washed with 1× Wash Buffer (100 μL/well) once. Carefulness was kept during operation and washing procedure to maintain cell adhesion and integrity. Good results could be obtained by slowly sucking and releasing liquid.

The penetrating membrane solution was sucked out, each well was washed once with 100 μL/well of 1× Wash Buffer. The Wash Buffer was sucked out, each well was added with 50 μL of Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin Solution, incubated at room temperature in dark for 30 min. The Alexa Fluor 488 Phalloidin solution was sucked out, washed with 1× Wash Buffer for three times, and the solution of the last time was kept in the well. The edge of plate was covered with sealing membrane (for prevention of drying), and assayed with HCS Reader. The plate was preserved at 4° C. environment temperature. The extent of cardiomyocyte apoptosis was finally detected by fluorescence staining method. The results are shown in Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5. This analysis method is a high connotation screening analytical method. It is a method for detecting apoptosis newly developed in recent years, which uses specific fluorescence staining to perform multiplicity of apoptosis. Three parameters relevant to apoptosis process were mainly analyzed, including karyomorphology change, mitochondrial swelling and/or mitochondrial transmembrane potential, F-actin content. HCS Reader can observe morphology of nucleus by Hoechst staining, and can compare quantitatively nucleus area and nucleus strength. The decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and the increase of mitochondrial volume are generally accepted as early markers of apoptosis, and can be quantitated by mitochondrial tracer MitoTracker® Red.
