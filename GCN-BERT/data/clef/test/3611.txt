Step 2: 2-[bromo(d2)methyl]-5-(2H3)methylpyrimidine
To a solution of [5-(d3)methylpyrimidin-2-yl](d2)methanol [Example 11, Step 1] (700 mg, 5.42 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in DCM (10 mL) was added PPh3 (1.42 g, 5.42 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and NBS (964.8 mg, 5.42 mmol, 1.00 equiv) at 0° C. The resulting solution was stirred for 1 h at 0° C. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of H2O (10 mL). The resulting solution was extracted with DCM (3×15 mL). The organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was applied onto a silica gel column with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1:2) to afford 180 mg (17.4%) of 2-[bromo(d2)methyl]-5-(d3)methylpyrimidine as a yellow oil.
