TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a method for producing a fluorine-containing elastomer. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for producing a fluorine-containing elastomer having excellent compression set characteristic. BACKGROUND ART Compared to general-purpose elastomers, fluorine-containing elastomers are high-performance but expensive; thus, the field of their applications has been conventionally limited. However, applications of fluorine-containing elastomer products are recently increasing, particularly in the automobile industry, as performance demands, such as fuel sealing properties, heat resistance, and chemical stability, for various parts are increasing from the environmental aspects. Moreover, in addition to applications for automobile parts, for general industrial machinery applications, semiconductor applications, and applications for O rings, oil seals, packings, gaskets, and the like for chemical plants, it is required to combine elasticity, heat-resistant chemical stability, chemical resistance, fuel resistance, etc. For this reason, various types of fluorine-containing elastomers are used. Therefore, it is the fact that recent market demands are increasingly placed on fluorine-containing elastomers of higher-performance than existing fluorine-containing elastomers. Compression set characteristic is regarded as a characteristic of fluorine-containing elastomer products, particularly one of important characteristics for seal applications. Compression set characteristic has great influence not only on seal performance but also on product life, etc. Moreover, fluorine-containing elastomers show various different properties, depending on their copolymerization compositions. For molded products obtained by vulcanization molding of fluorine-containing elastomers, product performance can be balanced by devising various compounds, for example, fillers such as carbon black and crosslinking agents, to be compounded into the fluorine-containing elastomers; however, the actual circumstances are that it is difficult to fundamentally improve the performance of fluorine-containing elastomers themselves. Furthermore, in North America, automobile products are required to have low fuel permeability from the environmental aspects together with its specific numerical targets; however, an attempt to achieve the above numerical targets by a conventional method, for example, by increasing fluorine contents, causes problems with adverse effects not only on compression set characteristic but also on depression of rubber elasticity. As a method for improving compression set characteristic without changing fluorine contents and impairing rubber elasticity, the present applicant has previously proposed in Patent Documents 1 to 3 using a fluorine-containing divinyl ether compound monomer as a copolymerization component of a fluorine-containing elastomer. According to these inventions, the total amount of fluorine-containing divinyl ether compound monomer is initially added for copolymerization to the polymerization reaction system. In this case, the compression set characteristic of fluorine-containing elastomer molded products can be improved; however, product characteristics are adversely affected (e.g., decreased elongation at break or increased hardness). In addition, Patent Documents 4 and 5 propose using a diolefin compound monomer as a copolymerization component of a fluorine-containing elastomer. According to these patent documents, compression set characteristic can be improved and mechanical strength can also be enhanced; however, the improvement in compression set characteristic is accompanied with changes not suitable for product characteristics such as increased hardness. Furthermore, diolefin compound monomers are disadvantageous from an economic standpoint, because they have in their hydrocarbon double bonds, which cause the copolymerization reaction rate to be slow and the copolymerization rate not to be high. PRIOR ART DOCUMENT PATENT DOCUMENT Patent Document 1 : JP-A-2004-346087 Patent Document 2 : JP-A-2007-092076 Patent Document 3 : JP-A-2008-303321 Patent Document 4 : JP-B-3574198 Patent Document 5 : JP-B-4219492 Patent Document 6 : JP-B-58-4728 Patent Document 7 : JP-B-54-1585 OUTLINE OF THE INVENTION PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a fluorine-containing elastomer in which a divinyl ether compound monomer is copolymerized, whereby a molded product of the elastomer can exhibit high compression set characteristic, while reducing a decrease in breaking strength, a decrease in elongation at break or an increase in hardness. MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM The above object of the present invention can be achieved by a method for producing a peroxide-crosslinkable fluorine-containing elastomer, comprising subjecting a fluorine-containing olefin and a perfluoroalkyl divinyl ether monomer represented by the general formula: CF2=CF-[OCF2CF(CF3)]aO(CF2)bO[CF(CF3)CF2O]c-CF=CF2 wherein a+c is an integer of 0 to 4 and b is an integer of 2 or more, to a copolymerization reaction; wherein the perfluorodivinyl ether monomer is added for copolymerization separately before and after the copolymerization reaction starts, or the total amount thereof is added for copolymerization after the copolymerization reaction starts. EFFECT OF THE INVENTION The fluorine-containing elastomer obtained by the method of the present invention has the following excellent effects: a peroxide-crosslinked molded product of the elastomer reduces a decrease in breaking strength, a decrease in elongation at break or an increase in hardness, and exhibits high compression set characteristic, for example, the compression set of the molded product in the form of an O ring at 200°C after 22 hours is 15% or less and the compression set of the molded product in the same form at 200°C after 70 hours is 20% or less. EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Examples of fluorine-containing olefins include vinylidene fluoride [VdF], hexafluoropropene [HFP], tetrafluoroethylene [TFE], perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether, perfluoroalkoxyalkyl vinyl ether, chlorotrifluoroethylene, difluorobromoethylene and the like. Examples of copolymers comprising these fluorine-containing olefins as main structural units include vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropene copolymers, vinylidene fluoride-hexafluoropropene-tetrafluoroethylene terpolymers, vinylidene fluoride-tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether terpolymers, vinylidene fluoride-tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether-perfluoroalkoxyalkyl vinyl ether tetrapolymers, tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether copolymers, tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkoxyalkyl vinyl ether copolymers and the like. In the fluorine-containing elastomer, a perfluorodivinyl ether monomer is copolymerized in an amount of about 0.05 to 2 mol%, preferably about 0.1 to 1 mol%, based on the copolymer. When the copolymerization ratio is less than this range, the effect of improving compression set characteristic is not achieved. In contrast, when the copolymerization ratio is greater than this range, a decrease in elongation at break and an undesirable increase in hardness are observed. Usable perfluorodivinyl ether monomers are those represented by the general formula: CF2=CF[OCF2CF(CF3)]aO(CF2)bO[CF(CF3)CF20]cCF-CF2 wherein a+c is an integer of 0 to 4 and b is an integer of 2 or more; preferably a+c is an integer of 0 to 2 and b is 2. The total amount of such monomer is not supplied before the copolymerization reaction starts, but is generally added separately before and after the copolymerization reaction starts. The amount of perfluorodivinyl ether monomer added before the copolymerization reaction starts is 30 wt.% or less of the total amount of the monomer to be added. Alternatively, the total amount thereof may be added after the copolymerization reaction starts. The divinyl ether monomer may be added separately before and after the copolymerization reaction start, or the total amount thereof may be added after the copolymerization reaction starts. It is preferable that the divinyl ether monomer is added before the copolymerization reaction starts and added in multiple batches after the copolymerization reaction starts; or that, while monitoring the progress of the polymerization reaction, the total amount of perfluorodivinyl ether monomer to be added is introduced in several batches each in a small amount so that the monomer is uniformly dispersed. More specifically, following examples are provided: (a) depending on the amount of main monomer added in batches, the perfluorodivinyl ether monomer is added so that the monomer is uniformly dispersed; or (b) depending on the amount of polymer produced, the perfluorodivinyl ether monomer is added so that the monomer is uniformly dispersed. Here, "before the copolymerization reaction starts" indicates before the addition of a polymerization initiator and "after the copolymerization reaction starts" indicates after the addition of the polymerization initiator. As the former method (a), for example, every time the amount of main monomer added in batches and the amount of perfluorodivinyl ether monomer reacted get closer to the target copolymerization composition after the copolymerization reaction starts, an equivalent amount of perfluorodivinyl ether monomer is added in batches. As the latter method (b), for example, every time the produced polymer composition becomes the target copolymerization composition after the copolymerization reaction starts, an equivalent amount of perfluoroalkyl divinyl ether monomer is added in batches. The former method (a) is suitable when copolymerization is performed while maintaining the reaction pressure at a constant level by introducing the main monomer with a uniform composition. The latter method (b) is suitable when the main monomer is introduced in one batch into the reactor and not added in batches thereafter, or in the case of a polymerization method in which a specified amount of monomer is introduced in batches, followed by aging to efficiently consume the residual monomer. Aging may be useful in terms of productivity, but may have adverse effects on the uniformity of the polymerization composition and physical properties. However, when a perfluorodivinyl ether monomer is introduced during aging or when a sufficient amount of perfluorodivinyl ether monomer is present in the reaction system during aging, undesirable characteristics such as ununiformity and deteriorated physical properties can be suppressed. Accordingly, as shown in Examples described later, fluorine-containing elastomers into which a perfluorodivinyl ether monomer is introduced so that the monomer is more uniformly dispersed show excellent normal-state physical properties including higher compression set characteristic, as compared to fluorine-containing elastomers obtained by introducing the total amount of perfluorodivinyl ether monomer into the reactor in one batch before polymerization. The aforementioned Patent Document 3 discloses a copolymerization method using a divinyl ether monomer (a=0, b=2, c=1), wherein the total amount of divinyl ether monomer, which is used in a small amount, is added at once to the reaction system before the copolymerization reaction starts. Further, the fluorine-containing elastomer preferably contains a saturated or unsaturated bromine- and/or iodine-containing compound in order to introduce a crosslinking site or to adjust the molecular weight of the fluorine-containing elastomer copolymer. Examples of such a bromine- and/or iodine-containing compound include compounds represented by the general formula: XRfX, wherein X is I or Br and Rf is a perfluoroalkylene group having 2 to 8 carbon atoms, such as ICF2CF2CF2CF2I, ICF2CF2CF2CF2Br, ICF2CF2Br; and the like (disclosed in Patent Document 6, etc.), and compounds represented by the general formula: RfX, wherein Rf is an unsaturated fluorohydrocarbon group having 2 to 8 carbon atoms and may have one or more ether bonds in the group and X is bromine or iodine, such as CF2=CFOCF2CF2Br, CF2=CFOCF2CF(CF3)OCF2CF2Br, CF2=CFBr, CF2=CHBr, CF2=CFI, CF2=CHI; and the like (disclosed in Patent Document 7, etc.). Among these, ICF2CF2CF2CF2I, CF2=CFOCF2CF2Br, CF2=CFI and CF2=CHI are preferably used. Such an iodine- and/or bromine-containing compound easily undergoes radical cleavage of iodine and/or bromine during the polymerization reaction by the action of an organic peroxide radical source. Because the produced radicals are highly reactive, the monomer undergoes additional growth reaction. Thereafter, the reaction is stopped by extracting iodine and/or bromine from the iodine- and/or bromine-containing compound. When a saturated iodine- and/or bromine-containing compound is used, a fluorine-containing elastomer in which iodine and/or bromine bind to the molecular end is produced. The copolymerization reaction of a fluorine-containing monoolefin and a fluorine-containing diene compound in the presence of such a bromine- and/or iodine-containing compound for forming a crosslinking site is performed by a commonly-used random copolymerization reaction in the presence of a polymerization initiator. The fluorine-containing elastomer can be produced by any method of emulsion polymerization, suspension polymerization or solution polymerization; however, emulsion polymerization is preferably employed in terms of economic efficiency and obtaining a high-molecular-weight copolymer. Emulsion polymerization is carried out by using a water-soluble peroxide such as ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate or sodium persulfate as a free radical generator. Such a water-soluble peroxide can be used also as a redox system concurrently using a reducing agent such as sodium sulfite or sodium bisulfite. Examples of emulsifiers include compounds represented by the general formula: Rf-COOH, wherein Rf is a fluorohydrocarbon group having 4 to 10 carbon atoms or a fluoroalkoxyalkyl group having 3 to 12 carbon atoms and having one or more ether bonds in the group. Specific examples thereof include ammonium perfluorooctanoate, ammonium perfluorononanoate, ammonium perfluoroheptanoate, ammonium salts and sodium salts of other fluorine-containing compounds and the like. In order to adjust the pH of the polymerization system, an electrolyte having a buffer capacity such as phosphate, for example, sodium hydrogen phosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate or borate can also be allowed to be coexist. The polymerization reaction is carried out under conditions where the temperature is 0 to 100°C and the pressure is 10 MPa or less. The fluorine-containing elastomer obtained by the above reaction is cured by peroxide crosslinking method. Examples of organic peroxides usable in peroxide crosslinking method include 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(t-butylperoxy)hexane, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(t-butylperoxy)hexyne-3, benzoyl peroxide, bis(2,4-dichlorobenzoyl)peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, t-butylcumyl peroxide, t-butylperoxy benzene, 1,1-bis(t-butylperoxy)-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexane, 2,5-dimethylhexane-2,5-dihydroxyperoxide, α,α'-bis(t-butylperoxy)-p-diisopropylbenzene, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(benzoylperoxy)hexane, t-butylperoxyisopropyl carbonate and the like; preferably, 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-bis(t-butylperoxy)hexane is used. The proportion of the organic peroxide is about 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably about 0.5 to 5 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the fluorine-containing elastomer. In peroxide crosslinking, a polyfunctional unsaturated compound co-crosslinking agent such as tri(meth)allyl isocyanurate, tri(meth)allyl cyanurate, triallyl trimellitate, N,N'-m-phenylene bismaleimide, diallyl phthalate; and the like is preferably used. The proportion of such a co-crosslinking agent is about 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, preferably about 0.5 to 5 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the fluorine-containing elastomer. Due to the combined use of a co-crosslinking agent, a vulcanizate having excellent vulcanization characteristic, mechanical strength, compression set characteristic and other properties can be obtained. When the proportion of co-crosslinking agent is less than this range, crosslinking density is low, and compression set characteristic is deteriorated. In contrast, when the proportion is greater than this range, elongation is lowered. The tri(meth)allyl group as used herein refers to a triallyl group or a trimethallyl group. Further, a hydrotalcite compound, or an oxide or hydroxide of divalent metal, such as an oxide or hydroxide of calcium, magnesium, lead or zinc, is used as an acid acceptor. The proportion of such an acid acceptor is about 2 parts by weight or more, preferably 3 to 20 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the fluorine-containing elastomer. When the proportion of acid acceptor is less than this range, corrosion resistance to metal is impaired. The above crosslinking-system components may be directly mixed with the fluorine-containing elastomer or may be used after being diluted with carbon black, silica, clay, talc, diatomaceous earth, barium sulfate or the like. The composition comprising the above components may further contain, as necessary, other compounding agents such as reinforcing agents, fillers, processing aids, antioxidants, lubricants, plasticizers, pigments; and the like. When carbon black is used as a filler or a reinforcing agent, the proportion of carbon black is generally about 10 to 50 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the fluorine-containing elastomer. The addition of a bituminous fine powder can enhance compression set characteristic and extend the life of sealing materials, etc., because of improved heat resistance. The addition of a flat filler can improve fuel oil barrier properties and suppress evaporation of automotive fuel, etc., which are to be sealed. The above components are kneaded by a commonly-used mixing method such as roll mixing, kneader mixing, Banbury mixing, solution mixing; and the like followed by vulcanization molding. Thereafter, the resulting mixture is generally subjected to press vulcanization at about 100 to 250°C for about 1 to 60 minutes and oven vulcanization (secondary vulcanization) at about 150 to 300°C for about 0 to 30 hours, according to commonly-used crosslinking conditions. Primary vulcanization can also be carried out by steam under pressure. EXAMPLES The following describes the present invention with reference to Examples.
