FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to processes for the synthesis of buprenorphine or derivatives of buprenorphine. In particular, the present invention provides processes for the formation of these opiate compounds that minimizes the formation of impurities. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Buprenorphine is a semi-synthetic opiate with partial agonist and antagonist actions. As such, it is a powerful analgesic that is approximately twenty-five to forty times as potent as morphine and is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain or for pre-operative analgesia. Buprenorphine is also used to treat opiate addiction. Accordingly, the demand for buprenorphine is increasing. Processes for synthesizing buprenorphine have been known since the late 1960s; it is traditionally made from either thebaine or oripavine in multiple steps. However, overall yield is typically low and the final product has levels of impurities that exceed the currently prescribed guidelines established by the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (USP). A need, therefore, exists for efficient processes that increase the yield of buprenorphine while minimizing the formation of side products, wherein the final product has a level of purity that meets current ICH and USP standards. WO2007/081506 is directed to a method for the synthesis of norbuprenorphine, and ultimately buprenorphine, utilizing oripavine as the starting material. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly, therefore, the present invention provides an improved synthesis route that increases the yield and purity of buprenorphine or a derivative of buprenorphine. Accordingly, the aspect of the invention encompasses a process for the preparation of a compound of Formula (VII) according to the following reaction scheme: wherein: R is an alkyl or substituted alkyl;R1 is cyclopropylmethyl;R2 and R3 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl and substituted hydrocarbyl;R4 and R5 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, substituted hydrocarbyl, halogen, {-}OH, {-}NH2, {-}SH, {-}SR10, and {-}OR10;R6 and R7 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a protecting group, hydrocarbyl, and substituted hydrocarbyl;R8 is methylR9 and R10 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbyl and substituted hydrocarbyl;M is selected from the group consisting of a metal cation having a charge of +2, and a metal cation group having a charge of +2;X is a heteroatom; andX1 is a halogen. The process comprises six steps. The first step comprises contacting a compound of Formula (I) with methyl vinyl ketone as a dienophile, in the presence of a solvent selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, isobutanol, t-butanol, n-butanol, or a combination thereof, comprising from 10% to 35% (v/v) of water, wherein the reaction mixture is heated to a temperature of 50°C to 100°C for a period of time that is sufficient for the conversion of a substantial portion of the compound of Formula (I) to the compound of Formula (II). The second step comprises contacting the compound of Formula (II) with an aprotic solvent and a catalyst that catalyzes hydrogen addition to form a compound of Formula (III). The third step of the process comprises contacting the compound of Formula (III) with R9MgX1 to form the compound of Formula (IV). The fourth step comprises contacting the compound of Formula (IV) with X1CN to form the compound of Formula (V). The fifth step comprises contacting the compound of Formula (V) with a hydrolysis agent to form the compound of Formula (VI). The sixth step comprises contacting the compound of Formula (VI) with MCO3, a catalytic additive selected from the group consisting of potassium iodide, sodium iodide and cesium iodide, and R1X1, the amount of alkenyl impurity in R1X1 being less than 0.15% by weight, and heating the reaction mixture to a temperature of less than 60°C to form the compound of Formula (VII). Additional embodiments and iterations of the invention are described in more detail below. DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES Figure 1 depicts a graph that illustrates the correlation between the amount of 7-β epimer formed as the percentage (v/v) of water increases during the reaction of step 1 in which thebaine (compound (Ia)) reacts with methyl vinyl ketone to produce 6,14-endo-etheno-7α-acetyltetrahydrothebaine (compound (IIa)). The graph depicts use of six different amounts of water, namely 0% (v/v), 15% (v/v), 26% (v/v), 37% (v/v), 55% (v/v), and 100% (v/v). As shown in the graph, 0% (v/v) of water results in the formation of 1.401% by weight of the 7- β epimer, 15% (v/v) of water results in the formation of 0.828% by weight of the 7- β epimer, 26% (v/v) of water results in the formation of 0.724% by weight of the 7- β epimer, 37% (v/v) of water results in the formation of 1.010% by weight of the 7- β epimer, 55% (v/v) of water results in the formation of 1.155% by weight of the 7- β epimer, and 100% (v/v) of water results in the formation of 2.160% by weight of the 7- β epimer. The reactions were conducted in accordance with the procedures described in Example 1. Figure 2 illustrates that seeding of the crystallization process of step 1 further reduces the β -epimer levels. Presented on the left is a process capability analysis in which the wt % β -epimer is plotted for six pilot plant runs. The process capacity indexes (i.e., Cpk, Ppk) and other indices are presented on the right. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention provides an efficient synthetic route for producing buprenorphine or derivatives of buprenorphine in high yield and high purity. In particular, processes have been discovered that efficiently convert a substrate to the desired product and reduce or eliminate side reactions that give rise to impurities in the final product. Reduction in the levels of impurities ultimately increases the overall yield of buprenorphine or a derivative of buprenorphine. In particular, the overall yield of buprenorphine or a derivative of buprenorphine is increased to greater than about 10% and the level of any related impurity is less than or equal to about 0.15% by weight. The synthetic route generally encompasses a six-step process for the production of buprenorphine or derivatives of buprenorphine (e.g., a compound of Formula VII) from thebaine, derivatives of thebaine, oripavine and/or derivatives of oripavine (e.g., a compound of Formula (I)). For purposes of illustration, Reaction Scheme 1 depicts the production of the compound of Formula (VII) from the compound of Formula (I) in accordance with the aspect of the present invention: wherein: R is an alkyl or substituted alkyl;R1 is cyclopropylmethyl;R2 and R3 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl and substituted hydrocarbyl;R4 and R5 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydrocarbyl, substituted hydrocarbyl, halogen, {-}OH, {-}NH2, {-}SH, {-}SR10, and {-}OR10;R6 and R7 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a protecting group, hydrocarbyl, and substituted hydrocarbyl;R8 is methylR9 and R10 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrocarbyl and substituted hydrocarbyl;M is selected from the group consisting of a metal cation having a charge of +2, and a metal cation group having a charge of +2;X is a heteroatom; andX1 is a halogen. In an embodiment, R, R6 and R7 are methyl. In an iteration of this embodiment, X is oxygen. In an alternate embodiment, R9 is tertiary butyl. In yet another alternate embodiment, R9 is an alkyl or substituted alkyl and X1 is chloride or bromide. In an exemplary embodiment, the compound of Formula (VII) is the compound of Formula (Vila): (a) Step 1: conversion of compound of Formula (I) to compound of Formula (II) Step 1 comprises a cyclo-addition reaction (i.e., a Diels Alder reaction) between a substrate comprising a conjugated diene and a dienophile. Generally, the substrate for preparation of the compound of Formula (II) corresponds to the compound of Formula (I) depicted in reaction Scheme 1. An exemplary compound of Formula (I) comprises the following substituents: R, R6, and R7 are methyl; R2, R3, R4, and R5 are hydrogen; and X is oxygen. In step 1 of the process, the compound of Formula (I) is contacted with a dienophile. The dienophile is methyl vinyl ketone. The molar ratio of the compound of Formula (I) to the dienophile can and will vary. Typically, the molar ratio of the compound of Formula (I) to the dienophile may range from about 1:1.5 to about 1:5.5. In a preferred embodiment, the molar ratio of the compound of Formula (I) to the dienophile may range from about 1:1.75 to 1:3. In certain preferred embodiments, the molar ratio of the compound of Formula (I) to the dienophile may be about 1:1.75, 1:2.0, 1:2.25, 1:2.5, 1:2.75, or 1:3.0. Contact between the compound of Formula (I) and the dienophile occurs in a solvent comprising water. As shown in Example 1 and Figure 1, the inclusion of water within an optimized range minimizes the formation of impurities, and in particular, the β-epimer of the compound of Formula (II). At least one additional solvent is included. The solvent(s) to be combined with water is selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, isobutanol, t-butanol, n-butanol, or a combination thereof. The solvent will comprise from 10% to 35% by volume water with the balance being alcohol. The reaction of step 1 is conducted at a temperature that ranges from 50°C to 100°C for a period of time that is sufficient to convert a substantial portion of the compound of Formula (I) to the compound of Formula (II). In a preferred embodiment, the temperature of the reaction may range from about 75°C to about 85°C. The reaction is preferably performed under ambient pressure, and preferably in an inert atmosphere (e.g., nitrogen or argon). Typically, the reaction is allowed to proceed for a sufficient period of time until the reaction is complete, as determined by chromatography (e.g., HPLC). In this context, a "completed reaction" generally means that the reaction mixture contains a significantly diminished amount of a compound of Formula (I) and a significantly increased amount of the compound of Formula (II) compared to the amounts of each present at the beginning of the reaction. Typically, the amount of the compound of Formula (I) remaining in the reaction mixture may be less than about 0.01%. When the reaction is completed, the reaction mixture is cooled. Typically, as detailed in Example 1, the reaction mixture is cooled from the reaction temperature (i.e., around 80°C) to about room temperature then to about 5°C. As the reaction mixture is cooled, the compound of Formula (II) typically crystallizes out of the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture at this point comprises the solvent, the unreacted compound of Formula (I), and the dienophile. Since the product crystallizes out directly after the one-pot reaction, the compound of Formula (II) may be easily separated from the reaction mixture without solvent distillation. This beneficially avoids the need to handle the reaction mixture comprising the dienophile in order to isolate the reaction product. It has been discovered that addition of seed material to the reaction mixture as it cools further reduces the amount of impurities formed (see Example 2). The seed material typically comprises a crystalline form of the compound of Formula (II). In addition, the seed material also typically comprises a very low percentage by weight of the target impurity, such as below about 0.5% by weight. The amount of seed material added can and will vary, but addition of even trace amounts (such as a single crystal) may reduce the target impurity. In one exemplary iteration, the compound of Formula (I) is thebaine, the compound of Formula (II) is 6,14-endo-etheno-7α-acetyltetrahydrothebaine, and the target impurity to be minimized is the β epimer, i.e., 6,14-endo-etheno-7β-acetyltetrahydrothebaine. In this iteration, by way of non-limiting example, 0.001 kg of seed material comprising crystalline 6,14-endo-etheno-7a-acetyltetrahydrothebaine may be added per every 20 kg of thebaine charged to the reaction mixture. The seed material may be added as the reaction is cooling, such as for example, when the reaction is cooled to about 45°C. As illustrated in Example 2 and Figure 2, use of this seeding protocol in combination with a solvent comprising water may reduce the amount of the 7- β epimer by as much as 90% by weight. The yield of the compound of Formula (II) may vary. Typically, the yield of the compound may range from about 70% to about 95%. In one embodiment, the yield of the compound may range from about 70% to about 80%. In another embodiment, the yield of the compound may range from about 80% to about 90%. In a further embodiment, the yield of the compound may range from about 90% to about 95%. In an exemplary embodiment, when the compound of Formula (I) is thebaine or oripavine and the compound of Formula (II) is 6,14-endo-etheno-7α-acetyltetrahydrothebaine or 6,14-endo-etheno-7α-acetyltetrahydrooripavine, then the amount of the 7- β epimer formed is less than about 1% by weight of the product (i.e., the compound comprising Formula (II)). In another embodiment, the amount of the 7- β epimer formed is less than about 0.75% by weight of the product. In yet another embodiment, the amount of the 7- β epimer formed is less than about 0.5% by weight of the product. In still another embodiment, the amount of the 7- β epimer formed is less than about 0.25% by weight of the product. In an exemplary embodiment, the amount of the 7- β epimer formed is less than about 0.2% by weight of the product. Stated another way, preferably the 7-α epimer formed is typically greater than 99% by weight of the product, more typically, is greater than about 99.5% by weight of the product, and in an exemplary embodiment, the amount of the 7-α epimer formed is greater than about 99.8% by weight of the product. (b) Step 2: conversion of compound of Formula (II) to compound of Formula (III) In step 2 of the process, the double bond of the Diels Alder reaction product formed in step 1 is reduced. The substrate for preparation of the compound of Formula (III) corresponds to the compound of Formula (II) depicted in Reaction Scheme 1. An exemplary compound of Formula (II) comprises the following constituents: R, R6 and R7 are methyl; R2, R3, R4, and R5 are hydrogen; and X is oxygen. Step 2 of the process commences with formation of a hydrogenation reaction mixture by combining the compound of Formula (II), with a catalyst in the presence of an aprotic solvent. Several aprotic solvents are suitable for use in the hydrogenation reaction. In an exemplary iteration, the solvent is a solvent having at least one acetate moiety, preferably a C2 - C5 acetate, more preferably a C2 - C3 acetate, and even more preferably a C3 acetate such as isopropyl acetate (see Examples 4-6). As used herein, the term "C2 - C5 acetate" refers to all compounds having from two to five carbon atoms in addition to the acetate moiety. Likewise, the term "C2 - C3 acetate" refers to all compounds having from two to three carbon atoms in addition to the acetate moiety. The hydrogenation catalyst may comprise a catalyst that catalyzes hydrogen addition to the alkeno bridge, preferably the etheno bridge, of the compound of Formula (II) to produce the alkano, preferably ethano, bridge, of the compound of Formula (III). In preferred embodiments, the hydrogenation catalyst is a heterogeneous catalyst that is capable of being filtered from the reaction mixture. In certain preferred embodiments, the catalyst is a transition metal catalyst, optionally adsorbed onto a support such as alumina, barium sulfate, barium carbonate, calcium carbonate, carbon, and the like, and even more preferably the transition metal is a platinum-group metal, such as ruthenium, osmium, rhodium, iridium, palladium or platinum. In certain highly preferred embodiments, the platinum-group metal is palladium, optionally adsorbed onto a carbon support. Such catalysts are commercially available from suppliers such as Degussa and Engelhard. The hydrogenation catalyst loading is preferably in the range of about 1 to about 15 mole %, preferably in the range of about 5 to about 10 mole %, and most preferably in the range of about 6 to about 7 mole % of 5% palladium on charcoal. The pressure of hydrogen gas during the hydrogenation reaction is preferably from about 10 psig to about 60 psig; more preferably from about 15 psig to about 50 psig, and even more preferably from about 20 psig to about 40 psig. In general, the hydrogenation reaction may be conducted at a temperature that ranges from about 55°C to about 85°C. In a preferred embodiment, the temperature of the reaction may range from about 70°C to about 75°C. Typically, the hydrogenation reaction is allowed to proceed for a sufficient period of time until the reaction is complete, as defined above. In general, however, the hydrogenation reaction time is preferably from about 4 to about 9 hours, more preferably from about 3 to about 7 hours, and even more preferably from about 5 to about 6 hours. A distinct advantage of certain of the preferred embodiments of the step 2 reaction is the reduced reaction time using a solvent as described herein as the hydrogenation carrier medium, preferably as the reaction solvent. In contrast, the prior art typically indicates protic solvents for the hydrogenation reaction (e.g., alcoholic solvents, such as ethanol or isopropanol, or acidic solvents, such as acetic acid). Observed reaction time reductions using a solvent of the present invention, preferably a solvent having at least one acetate moiety, and even more preferably isopropyl acetate, compared to a protic solvent are from about 30% to about 70%, more preferably from about 40% to about 60%, and even more preferably from about 50% to about 55%. A further distinct advantage of the solvent utilized in the hydrogenation reaction (e.g., isopropyl acetate) is that the amount of the compound of Formula (II) not hydrogenated is significantly reduced compared to use of a protic solvent, such as acetic acid. For example, applicants have discovered that use of acetic acid typically results in greater than 1% of the compound of Formula (II) not hydrogenated. In comparison, the use of isopropyl acetate results in complete or nearly complete hydrogenation of the compound of Formula (II). In an exemplary embodiment, the amount of the compound of Formula (II) not hydrogenated is less than about 0.05% by weight. In another embodiment, the amount of the compound of Formula (II) not hydrogenated is less than about 0.025% by weight. In an exemplary embodiment, the amount of the compound of Formula (II) not hydrogenated is less than about 0.01% by weight. Any of the compound of Formula (II) that goes forward from this step becomes Impurity D in the final product of the overall synthesis process (see section (I)(f) below). After the hydrogenation reaction is substantially completed, the hydrogenation reaction mixture is typically concentrated to aide in the purification of the hydrogenation product. In this context, the catalyst is generally removed by filtration, and the solvent, such as isopropyl acetate, is partially removed by distillation. The amount of solvent removed can and will vary. In one embodiment, from about 50% to about 100% of the solvent is removed via distillation. In an exemplary embodiment, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, or greater than 95% of the solvent is removed via distillation. In an exemplary iteration, after the solvent is removed from the hydrogenation reaction mixture an alkane is added. It has been found that addition of an alkane facilitates crystallization of the compound of Formula (III). The alkane may be linear, branched, or a cycloalkane. Suitable examples of alkanes include but are not limited to n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, isopentane, neopentane, isohexane, neohexane, isoheptane, neoheptane, cyclopentane, and cyclohexane. In an exemplary alternative of this embodiment, the alkane is heptane or cyclohexane. The amount of alkane added to the hydrogenation reaction mixture can and will vary without departing from the scope of the invention. In one embodiment, the amount of alkane added may range from about 0.5 to about 5 kg for each kg of hydrogenation product that is formed. In certain embodiments, the alkane may be added to the hydrogenation reaction mixture as it cools. In other embodiments, the alkane may be added to the hydrogenation reaction mixture while the mixture is heated, such as to a temperature from about 60°C to about 90°C. After the addition of the alkane, however, the hydrogenation reaction mixture is typically cooled to a temperature of less than about 20°C during the crystallization process. In an exemplary embodiment, the temperature is reduced to less than about 10°C during the crystallization process. It has been found that this crystallization process preferably removes substantially all of the 7- β-epimer impurities (of both the substrate and the product) and provides the crystalline form of the compound of Formula (III) preferably in a yield of least about 90% with a purity of about 95% to about 97%, or more preferably, a purity of about 98% to about 99%. Material of this quality is suitable for use in most applications without further purification by recrystallization. (c) Step 3: conversion of compound of Formula (III) to compound of Formula (IV) Step 3 of the process comprises an addition (or Grignard) reaction. The substrate for preparation of the compound of Formula (IV) corresponds to the compound of Formula (III) depicted in Reaction Scheme 1. An exemplary compound of Formula (III) comprises the following substituents: R, R6 and R7 are methyl; R2, R3, R4, and R5 are hydrogen; and X is oxygen. In step 3 of the process, the compound of Formula (III) is contacted with R9MgX1 (which is also known as a Grignard reagent). In general, R9 is a hydrocarbyl or a substituted hydrocarbyl, and X1 is a halogen. Preferably, X1 may be chloride or bromide. In one embodiment, R9 may be an alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl, or substituted aryl. In a preferred embodiment, R9 may be an alkyl or substituted alkyl. The alkyl or substituted alkyl may have about 12 carbons or less, or more preferably, about 6 carbons or less. Preferred R9 groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, n-amyl, cyclohexyl, and the like. In a preferred embodiment, R9 may be tertiary butyl. In an exemplary embodiment, the Grignard reagent may be tertiary-butyl magnesium chloride. The molar ratio of the compound of Formula (III) to the Grignard reagent can and will vary. Typically, the molar ratio of the compound of Formula (III) to the Grignard reagent may range from about 1:1 to about 1:5. In some embodiments, the molar ratio of the compound of Formula (I) or (Ia) to the Grignard reagent may be 1:1.0, 1:1.5, 1:2.0, 1:2.5, 1:3.0, 1:3.5, 1:4.0, 1:4.5, or 1:5.0. In a preferred embodiment, the molar ratio of the compound of Formula (III) to the Grignard reagent may range from about 1:2.5 to about 1:3.5. The solvent system used in step 3 comprises an aprotic solvent. A variety of aprotic solvents are suitable for use in the reaction of step 3. Non-limiting examples of suitable aprotic solvents include, diethoxymethane, diethyl ether, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), dimethoxymethane, bis(2-methoxyethyl)ether, hexamethylphosphoramide, methylene chloride, nitrobenzene, nitromethane, sulfolane, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran, and combinations thereof.

Suitable organic solvents include, but are not limited to, benzene, t-butyl methylether, chlorobenzene, chloromethane, cyclohexane, dichloromethane, dichloroethane, diethyl ether, fluorobenzene, heptane, hexane, toluene, and combinations thereof. Preferably, the organic solvent may be toluene or heptane. In one exemplary embodiment, therefore, the solvent system may comprise tetrahydrofuran and toluene. In another exemplary embodiment, the solvent system may comprise toluene, heptane, and tetrahydrofuran. The weight ratio of the solvent system to the compound of Formula (III) may vary. In general, the weight ratio of the solvent system to the compound of Formula (III) may range from about 3:1 to about 30:1. In a preferred embodiment, the weight ratio of the solvent system to the compound of Formula (III) may range from about 7:1 to about 15:1. In some preferred embodiments, the weight ratio of the solvent system to the compound of Formula (III) may be about 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, 11:1, 12:1, 13:1, 14:1, or 15:1. In general, the step 3 reaction is conducted at a temperature that ranges from about 15°C to about 100°C. In certain embodiments, the temperature of the reaction may be about 15°, 20°, 25°, 30°, 35°, 40°, 45°, 50°, 55°, 60°, 65°, 70°, 75°, 80°, 85°, 90°, 95°, or 100°C. The reaction is typically conducted under an inert atmosphere (i.e., nitrogen or argon), and preferably under ambient pressure. Typically, the reaction is allowed to proceed for a sufficient period of time until the reaction is complete, essentially as defined above. Typically, the reaction is allowed to proceed for about one to two hours, or more preferably, about 1.5 hours. Upon completion of the reaction, a quenching agent is added to the reaction mixture to quench the reaction product (i.e., the compound of Formula (IV)) and the unreacted Grignard reagent. A preferred quenching agent is aqueous ammonium chloride, although other quenching agents known to those skilled in the art may be used, including aqueous ethyl acetate, aqueous sodium chloride, or aqueous hydrochloric acid solutions. In general, the molar ratio of the compound of Formula (III) to the quenching agent may range from about 1:1 to about 1:12. In a preferred embodiment, the molar ratio of the compound of Formula (III) to the quenching agent may range from about 1:2 to about 1:7. In certain preferred embodiment, the molar ratio of the compound of Formula (III) to the quenching agent may be about 1:2, 1:2.5, 1:3, 1:3.5, 1:4, 1:4.5, 1:5. 1:5.5, 1:6, 1:6.5, or 1:7. Typically, the compound of Formula (IV) is isolated by removing most of the solvent system to form a concentrated reaction mixture, and adding an alkane to the concentrated reaction mixture to facilitate crystallization of the product. The solvent system may be removed by distillation. Typically, at least about 50% of the solvent system may be removed. In one embodiment, at least about 80% of the solvent system may be removed. In a preferred embodiment, at least about 90% of the solvent system may be removed. The concentrated reaction mixture may be heated to a temperature that ranges from about 60°C to about 120°C before the addition of the alkane. In a preferred embodiment, the concentrated mixture may be heated to a temperature that ranges from about 80°C to about 100°C, or more preferably from about 90°-98°C before the addition of the alkane. The alkane that is added to the concentrated reaction mixture may be linear, branched, or cyclic. In a preferred embodiment, the alkane may comprise from about 4 to about 20 carbons, or more preferably, from about 6 to about 12 carbons. In an exemplary embodiment, the alkane may be heptane or cyclohexane. In general, the weight ratio of the alkane to the compound of Formula (III) may range from about 3:1 to about 10:1. In a preferred embodiment, the weight ratio of the alkane to the compound of Formula (III) may range from about 4:1 to about 6:1. In some preferred embodiment, the weight ratio of the alkane to the compound of Formula (III) may be about 4.0:1. 4.5:1, 5.0:1. 5.5:1, or 6.0:1. The concentrated reaction mixture comprising the alkane typically is allowed to cool, wherein the compound of Formula (IV) precipitates. In some embodiments, the concentrated reaction mixture comprising the alkane may be cooled to a temperature of less than about 20°C. In an exemplary embodiment, the concentrated reaction mixture comprising the alkane may be cooled to about 15°C. The cool temperature may be maintained for a period of time that ranges from about five minutes to more than ten hours. In a preferred embodiment, the cool temperature may be maintained from about 20 minutes to about 60 minutes. The crystallized compound of Formula (IV) may be removed from the reaction mixture by filtration. Those of skill in the art are familiar with suitable filtration procedures. The yield of the compound of Formula (IV) may range from about 45% to about 55%. Filtration of the reaction mixture also forms a filtrate, which comprises an amount of the compound of Formula (III) and an amount of the compound of Formula (IV). Typically, the amount of the compound of Formula (III) in the filtrate ranges from about 1 wt% to about 6 wt%, or more preferably about 3 wt%, and the amount of the compound of Formula (IV) in the filtrate may range from about 2 wt% to about 10 wt%, or more preferably about 5 wt %. The alkaloids in the filtrate may be reclaimed by recycling the filtrate. That is, the filtrate may be combined with a new reaction mixture comprising the compound of Formula (III) and a Grignard reagent, and the addition reaction is repeated. The recycling step may be performed one time, two times, three times, or four times. The yield of the compound of Formula (IV) increases with each recycling step. In general, the yield of the compound of Formula (IV) is greater than about 70% when two recycling steps are performed. As detailed in Example 8, when four recycling steps are performed, the yield of the compound of Formula (IV) typically increases by at least about 20% compared to when no recycling step is performed, based on virgin compound of Formula (III) introduced to each batch. (d) Step 4: conversion of compound of Formula (IV) to compound of Formula (V) In step 4 of the process, the R group on the nitrogen is replaced with a nitrile group. The substrate for preparation of the compound of Formula (V) corresponds to the compound of Formula (IV) in Reaction Scheme 1. An exemplary compound of Formula (IV) comprises the following substituents: R, R6 and R7 are methyl; R2, R3, R4, and R5 are hydrogen; R9 is tertiary butyl; and X is oxygen. Step 4 comprises contacting the compound of Formula (IV) with X1CN, as shown in Example 9. In preferred embodiments, X1 may be chloride or bromide. In an exemplary embodiment, the compound of Formula (IV) may be contacted with cyanogen bromide. The molar ratio of the compound of Formula (IV) to X1CN may range from about 1:1 to about 1:5. In preferred embodiments, the molar ratio of the compound of Formula (IV) to X1CN may be about 1:1.0, 1:1.5, 1:2.0, 1:2.5, or 1:3. In an exemplary embodiment the molar ratio of the compound of Formula (IV) to X1CN may be about 1:1.5. The reaction is typically performed in the presence of a hydrogen halide scavenging agent.

EXAMPLES The following examples are included to demonstrate preferred embodiments of the invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the following examples represent techniques discovered by the inventors to function well in the practice of the invention. Example 1: Synthesis of Compound (IIa) Compound (Ia) (i.e., thebaine) was converted to compound (IIa) (CA index name = 1-[(5α,7α)-4,5-epoxy-3,6-dimethoxy-17-methyl-6,14-ethenomorphinan-7-yl]-ethanone) via a Diels Alder reaction. For this, 575 g of wet technical grade thebaine (72 wt % by assay = 414.11 g; 1.329 moles; 28% water) was suspended, under nitrogen, by agitation in 1 L of isopropanol (ACS grade), and then 264 mL of 90% methyl vinyl ketone (∼2.2 equiv) and 200 mL of water were added to the mixture. The total water in the mixture was equal to the thebaine-derived water + the water added [(574 x 0.28 = 161 mL) + 200 mL = 361 mL; ∼35% v/v relative to isopropanol]. The mixture was then gently warmed to reflux (79°-80°C) over a period of 4 hours using an efficient condenser with a scrubber to minimize loss of methyl vinyl ketone vapors. The reaction was slightly exothermic but not self-sustaining. The mixture was then heated at 79°-80°C for 14 hours. (After about 1 hour at reflux, the heterogeneous slurry became homogeneous.) The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature over a period of about 4 hours, then cooled to 5°C and held at this temperature for 4 hours (the red/brown solution crystallized on cooling to give a yellow-colored suspension). There was typically a 4-5°C heat of crystallization observed in a mantle but only about 1°C observed in a jacketed reactor. The solid was filtered and washed with 5°C isopropanol (2 x 100 mL) to give compound (IIa) as a white crystalline solid. The mother liquors (which typically contained about 6% of product) were discarded as hazardous waste. The solid product was dried under vacuum (about 22 inches Hg) for about 12 hours to give 464.99 g of white crystalline solid. Secondary drying was done in a vacuum oven at about 22 inches Hg and 60°C for about 12 hours (with appropriate traps) if the product (464.65 g; 91.58%, m.p. 118-120 °C) was to be stored. HPLC of the solid product typically assayed at greater than 99 wt % of compound (IIa), about 0.32 - 0.73 wt % of the 7-β epimer, and less than 0.0087 wt % of unreacted thebaine. Example 2: Isolation of Compound (IIa) with Seeding Compound (IIa) was prepared essentially as detailed above in Example 1 except that seed crystals of compound (IIa) (1 g per 20 kg of thebaine) were added at 45°C when the reaction was cooling. The assay values were similar except that the 7- β epimer levels were consistently about 0.19 wt %. Example 3: Synthesis of Compound (IIIa) - Hydrogenation in Protic Solvent The following example illustrates the traditional hydrogenation method for reducing the double bond in compound (IIa) to form compound (IIIa) (CA index name = 1-[(5α,7α)-4,5-epoxy-18,19-dihydro-3,6-dimethoxy-17-methyl-6,14-ethenomorphinan-7-yl]-ethanone). Approximately, 8.5 kg of compound (IIa) (22.3 moles) was added portion-wise with stirring to a hydrogenation reactor containing 41 L of glacial acetic acid. After the starting material was dissolved, 223 g of platinum dioxide slurried in 1 L of acetic acid was added to the resulting solution. Hydrogenation was initiated at 15 psig hydrogen pressure at room temperature. The temperature was kept below 40° C and the reaction was run for approximately 18 hours. The catalyst was removed by filtration through diatomaceous earth, and washed with acetic acid (3 x 1 L). The filtrate was added slowly to a mixture of 54 L of concentrated ammonium hydroxide, 54 kg of ice, and 42 L of chloroform. The layers were separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with chloroform (2 x 20 L). The organic extracts were partially dried by filtration through a thick pad of diatomaceous earth. The chloroform was removed by distillation, maintaining a pot temperature of 85-90° C, and the residual oil was mixed with 32 L of hexane. The solvent was distilled off (16 L), and the mixture was cooled to 10° C. The precipitated compound (IIIa) was collected by filtration and washed with hexane (3 x 2 L). The crude yield was 75%. The compound (IIIa) was recrystallized from ethanol (4 mL/g) in order to remove the unreacted etheno starting material and epimeric impurities. The recovery was 93%. (If the impurity content was too high, a second recrystallization from ethanol (3 mL/g) was used.) Example 4: Synthesis of Compound (IIIa) - Hydrogenation in Aprotic Solvent To determine whether hydrogenation could be performed in the presence of an aprotic solvent, the following example was performed. The filtrate from a Diels-Alder reaction (in which 50 kg of thebaine was reacted with 26 kg of methyl vinyl ketone in 150 L of isopropyl acetate) was added to a hydrogenation reactor. With stirring, 5 kg of 5% palladium on charcoal, slurried in 10 L of isopropyl acetate, was added to the reactor. Hydrogen gas was introduced at a pressure of 30 psig, and the mixture was stirred and heated to 60-70° C for 6 hours. The catalyst was removed by filtration, and the isopropyl acetate partially removed by distillation (i.e., 130-150 L of isopropyl acetate was distilled off). Heptane, 160 L, was added, and the mixture was cooled to less than 10°C. The crystallized compound (IIIa) was isolated by filtration in 90% yield, without the need for further purification (i.e., epimer levels were not detectable and alkene levels were less than about 0.2%). This example illustrates that hydrogenation in the presence of an aprotic solvent allowed for a shorter reaction time, with decreased impurities. Example 5: Standard Hydrogenation with One Distillation Step and One Heptane Addition The following example details a reaction conducted with a typical ratio of isopropyl acetate to compound (IIa). The hydrogenation reactor was purged with nitrogen, and 107 kg of compound (IIa) and 7.2 kg of 5% palladium on carbon (wet basis) (0.067 kg/kg of starting compound) were added to the reactor. The reactor was repurged with nitrogen and 471 kg of isopropyl acetate (4.4 kg/kg of starting compound) was added. The agitator was started and the reactor was pressurized with 30 psig hydrogen and heated to 70°C for six hours. Upon completion of the reaction, the reactor was cooled to 30°C, the hydrogen pressure was vented, and the reactor was purged with 30 psig nitrogen. The mixture (which contained ∼18 wt% of compound (IIIa) in isopropyl acetate) was reheated to about 55°C and the catalyst was removed by filtration. The hydrogenator was then rinsed with 61 kg isopropyl acetate (0.57 kg/kg of starting compound) and the two filtrates were pooled. Isopropyl acetate was distilled from the crude filtrate under a low nitrogen purge flow by applying steam to the tank jacket. The distillation was continued until 453 kg (∼139 gallons) of isopropyl acetate was collected in the distillate receiver, and the pot temperature was between 94 and 97°C. The concentrate at the end of the distillation contained about 57 wt% solution of compound (IIIa). To this mixture, 107 kg heptane (1.0 kg/kg of starting compound) was added and the temperature was maintained between 80° and 90°C. The batch was then cooled to less than 10°C over a four to six hour period with constant agitation (compound (IIIa) began to crystallize at a temperature between 70 and 80°C). The slurry was stirred for at least one hour after the temperature reached 10°C, and then filtered or centrifuged to isolate compound (IIIa). The product was washed with 91 kg of heptane (0.85 kg/kg of starting compound) and dried under vacuum at 65° to 75°C for 6 to 8 hours to give about 100 kg of compound (IIIa) (93% isolated yield). Example 6: Dilute Hydrogenation with Two Distillation Steps and Two Heptane Additions The following example details a hydrogenation reaction using a high charge ratio of isopropyl acetate to starting compound. This reaction was conducted essentially as that described in Example 5, except for two changes. First, a total of 1070 kg of isopropyl acetate was added to the reactor (i.e., a charge ratio of 10.0 kg isopropyl acetate per kg of starting compound). Second, the dilute reaction mixture (which contained ∼9 wt% of compound (IIIa) in isopropyl acetate) only had to be heated to 35° to 40°C in order to keep the product in solution during the catalyst filtration step. The isopropyl acetate was distilled from the filtrate as detailed in Example 5. The first distillation was continued until 880 kg (∼269 gallons) of isopropyl acetate was collected in the distillate receiver. At this point, the concentration of compound (IIIa) in the batch was about 30 wt%, and the pot temperature was between 90° and 93°C. Then, 503 kg of heptane (4.7 kg/kg of stating compound) was added, while maintaining the temperature between 65° and 90°C. A second distillation was then carried out until an additional 549 kg (∼194 gal) of isopropyl acetate and heptane were distilled, and the pot temperature increased to between 95° and 98°C. After completing the second distillation, an additional 214 kg heptane (2.0 kg/kg of starting compound) was added while maintaining the temperature between 80° and 90°C. At this point, the batch composition was approximately 20 wt% of compound (IIIa), 7 wt% of isopropyl acetate, and 73 wt% of heptane. The batch was then gradually cooled to less than 10°C over a four to six hour period, and the slurry was stirred for at least one hour after the temperature reached 10°C. The slurry was then filtered or centrifuged to isolate compound (IIIa). The solid product was washed with 91 kg heptane (0.85 kg/kg of starting material) and dried under vacuum at 65° to 75°C for 6 to 8 hours to give about 100 kg of compound (IIIa) (93% isolated yield). Example 7: Synthesis of Compound (iVa) - No Recycling Step The following example details the Grignard addition reaction in which the ketone, compound (IIIa), is converted to compound (IVa) (CA index name = α-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4,5-epoxy-18,19-dihydro-3,6-dimethoxy-α,17-dimethyl-6,14-ethenomorphinan-7-methanol). A ketone charge was prepared by dissolving 87.11 g of compound (IIIa) (0.2273 moles) in 266.4 g of toluene, and the ketone solution was set aside. A 2-L jacketed flask was equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser, a receiver, and an addition port sealed with a septum. After purging the flask with nitrogen, a Grignard mixture was formed by adding 614.1 g of toluene and 415.2 g of a 19.22 wt% solution of tert-butylmagnesium chloride (79.81 g, 0.6828 moles) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to the flask. The Grignard mixture was concentrated by distilling overhead 438.5 g (42.6 % of the total charge) of distillate at atmospheric pressure to a final pot oil temperature of 103°C. The composition of the Grignard solution was 79.81 g of tert-BuMgCl, 142.4 g of THF, and 339.7 g of toluene. The concentrate in the flask was cooled to 60°C. The condenser and receiver were replaced with an addition funnel, and the ketone solution was added to the Grignard concentrate over a period of 31 minutes. The mixture was then stirred for an additional 90 minutes. The concentration of THF in the THF/toluene solvent mixture was 29.5 wt% before the ketone solution was added and 19.0 wt% after the ketone solution was added. Upon completion of the reaction period, the mixture was cooled to 6°C, and 367.7 g of a 20.26 wt% solution of NH4Cl (1.392 moles) in water was added over a period of 33 minutes. Then, 439.4 g of water was added, followed by 87.20 g of concentrated hydrochloric acid, which afforded a pH of 3.73. The mixture was vigorously stirred until all of the solids were dissolved. To the mixture was added 89.68g of concentrated ammonium hydroxide, which afforded a pH of 8.77. The entire mixture was vacuum filtered through Whatman Qualitative No. 1 filter paper. The mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel and the layers were separated into a 1026.1 g lower aqueous layer and a 827.5 g upper organic layer. The aqueous layer was transferred back to the 2-L flask and 120.8 g of toluene was added. The mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 minutes. The mixture was vacuum filtered and the layers were separated into a 1001.6 g lower aqueous layer and a 119.7 g upper organic layer. The two organic layers were combined in the 2-L flask and 81.44 g of water was added. The mixture was vigorously stirred for 30 minutes. The mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel and the separated into a 177.2 g lower aqueous layer and a 920.95 g upper organic layer, which contained the alkaloids. The 2-L flask was fitted with a short path distillation head, a condenser, and a receiver immersed in ice water. The 920.95 g organic layer was transferred to the flask. The solution was concentrated by vacuum distillation at 22 inches Hg vacuum to an overhead temperature of 75°C and a pot oil temperature of 87°C. Approximately 760.5 g (82.5% of the charge) of distillate was collected. The distillation head was replaced with an addition funnel, which was charged with 431.4 g of heptane. The pot oil was heated to 95°C and the heptane was added over a period of 69 minutes. The solution was cooled. Compound (IVa) crystallized at a temperature of 56°C. The mixture was cooled to 15°C and held at that temperature for 1 hr. The mixture was vacuum filtered to yield 65.27 g of wet cake and 395.96 g of filtrate. The wet cake was dried in a vacuum oven (22 inches Hg vacuum) at 65° for 13.5 hr to yield 56.17 g of product. Further drying at 80°C for 30 minutes afforded 55.27 g of compound (IVa). An HPLC analysis of the isolated product found 98.95 wt% of compound (IVa) and 2.72 wt% of compound (IIIa). The yield of compound (IVa) was about 55%. The filtrate contained 4.09 wt% of compound (IVa) and 2.90 wt% of compound (IIIa). Example 8: Synthesis of Compound (IVa) - With Recycled Filtrate A recycling process was investigated to determine whether recycling the crystallization filtrate by combining it with a new addition reaction would increase the overall isolated yield of compound (IVa). The 2-L jacketed reactor was fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a short path distillation setup, and a receiver. Then 395.96 g of filtrate (from Example 7) and 528.58 g of toluene were added. The solution was moderately agitated and a 22-inch Hg vacuum was applied. The solution was concentrated with distillation occurring at pot temperatures between 69° and 84°C. Approximately 847.71 g of distillate was collected, leaving 76.83 g of pot oil. HPLC analysis found that the concentrate contained 15.8 wt% of compound (IIIa) and 29.5 wt% of compound (IVa). The concentrated filtrate was added to another addition reaction. For this, 234.27 g of toluene and 76.61 g of compound (IIIa) were added to the concentrated filtrate. The solvent exchange vessel was rinsed with toluene, which was added to the concentrate making a total of 377.71 g of compound (IIIa) solution. HPLC analysis of this solution found 23.52 wt% of compound (IIIa) and 5.77 wt% of compound (IVa). Therefore, 12% of the compound (IIIa) solution was from recycle and 88% was virgin compound (IIIa). The compound (IIIa) solution was set aside. A 2-L jacketed reactor was set up for the Grignard solvent exchange and an inert nitrogen atmosphere was established. To the 2-L flask was added 631.11 g of toluene and 444.71 g of a 19.22 wt% solution of tert-BuMgCl in THF. The solution was concentrated by atmospheric pressure distillation to a pot oil temperature of 103°C, which afforded 517.07 g of distillate. The Grignard solution in the flask was cooled to 60° and 365.0 g of the previously prepared compound (IIIa) solution was added over a period of 63 minutes. The mixture was stirred for an additional 90 minutes. The reaction mixture was cooled to 8°C and then quenched with 386.59 g of a 20.26 wt% solution of ammonium chloride in water. Then 473.02 g of deionized water and 92.74 g of concentrated hydrochloric acid were added, which afforded a pH of 3.92. The mixture was aggressively stirred until most of the solids were dissolved. Then 100 g of concentrated ammonium hydroxide were added, to adjust the pH of the mixture to 8.79. The mixture was vacuum filtered and the filtrate was transferred to a separatory funnel. The layers were separated into a 1107.5 g lower aqueous layer and a 775.44 g upper organic layer, which contained the product. The water layer was transferred back to the 2-L flask and 113.8 g of toluene was added. The mixture was vigorously agitated and then the layers were separated into a 199.9 g lower aqueous layer and a 98.99 g upper organic layer. The two organic layers were combined in the 2-L flask and 88.35 g of deionized water was added. The mixture was aggressively stirred for 30 minutes. The layers were separated into a 88.77 g lower aqueous layer and a 852.13 g upper organic layer. The combined organic layer was transferred to the 2-L flask and the solution was concentrated by vacuum distillation at 22 inches Hg vacuum, at pot oil temperatures of 45-88°C, and overhead temperatures up to 78°C. Approximately 662.7 g of distillate was obtained. Solids that formed were dissolved by adding 3.77 g of toluene. The solution was heated to 95°C and 434.1 g of heptane was added over 52 minutes. The solution was cooled to 15°C and held at that temperature for 65 minutes. Crystallization occurred at 43°C. The mixture was vacuum filtered affording 424.43 g of filtrate and 117.24 g of wet cake. The wet cake was dried in a vacuum oven at 20 inches Hg vacuum and 80°C for 65 hr, which afforded 71.87 g of the addition product. The assay was 94.88 wt% of compound (IVa) and 4.52 wt% of compound (IIIa). Analysis of the filtrate found 5.56 wt% of the addition product and 3.03 wt% of the ketone. This procedure was repeated for all recycle batches. Table 1 presents the reaction parameters for the virgin batch and four recycle runs. Table 1.

It was found that four recycle runs was optimal - the levels of by-products increased to unacceptable levels after the fourth recycle run. These data reveal that four recycles of the filtrates increased the yield of isolated compound (IVa) from 55% to greater than 72%. Stated another way, recycling the filtrates increased the absolute yield of compound (IVa) by 17% over virgin batches, and increased the yield 31% relative to virgin batches.

A 3-neck jacketed reaction flask was set up with a reflux condenser, thermometer, and an overhead mixer. A programmable recirculator was connected to the jacket. The reaction flask was charged with 2.48 grams of potassium carbonate, 20.05 grams of compound (IVa) (91.08 wt% assay), 75 ml of chloroform, and 8.51 grams of cyanogen bromide. The agitator was set to 120 rpm, and the reaction was run for 19 hours at reflux (i.e., pot temperature of approximately 62°C). After the reaction was completed, the batch was cooled to 25°C. Approximately 25 ml of water was added, and the batch stirred at 300 rpm to dissolve any salts. The batch was transferred to a separatory funnel, mixed, and the layers were separated. The chloroform layer was retained. The aqueous layer was extracted twice with approximately 32 ml of chloroform each time. The aqueous layer was discarded, and the chloroform layers were combined. The total weight of the combined chloroform layers was 213.46 grams. The chloroform layers were transferred to a still and rinsed forward with 15 ml of chloroform. The still was provided with a condenser, receiver, thermometer, an overhead mixer and a recirculator. The batch was distilled at atmospheric pressure (998.5 millibar) to a final temperature of 80.6°C (the residue volume was 34 ml). To the residue was added 147 ml methanol. The batch was distilled at atmospheric pressure to a final volume of 96 ml. The batch was then cooled to 6.1 °C over approximately 4 hours to crystallize compound (Va). The compound was isolated by filtering through a Buchner funnel. The product was dried under vacuum at approximately 65°C. The yield of compound (Va) was 16.29 grams with an assay of 99.09% by weight. The overall yield on a molar basis, corrected for assay, was 86.24%. Example 10: Synthesis of Compound (VIa) The following example details the hydrolysis of compound (Va) to form compound (Via) (CA index name = α-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4,5-epoxy-18,19-dihydro-3-hydroxy-6-methoxy-a-methyl-6,14-ethenomorphinan-7-methanol). For this, potassium hydroxide pellets and diethylene glycol (DEG) were added to a Hastelloy C reactor, which was heated and agitated under a nitrogen sweep. Upon dissolution of the potassium hydroxide pellets, compound (Va) was added. The reaction mixture was heated to 185°C for 5-8 hours. A small amount of water was removed throughout the reaction duration. When the reactor was cooled, water was added to aid in the transfer out of the vessel where the work-up begins. The now diluted reaction mixture was filtered to remove any solids (such as, e.g., the compound comprising Formula (VIc) discussed below) and the pH was adjusted to the 8-9 range. The pH adjustment initiated the precipitation of compound (VIa), and the solids were filtered off. The solids were then re-slurried in water, heated to 50-80°C with agitation for about 1 hour. When the re-slurry was cooled to ambient temperature, compound (VIa) was filtered off and dried. Table 3 presents the results for five different hydrolysis reactions. Table 3.

Crude compound (VIa) was purified by recrystallization using a 57% methanol in acetonitrile mixed solvent. The charge ratio was 8.9 ml of acetonitrile and 11.7 ml methanol per gram of crude compound (VIa). The crude product was transferred to a vessel equipped with heating/cooling and distillation capabilities. The mixture was heated to about 65°C to dissolve the solids. Typically, the solution was dark brown in color and did not require filtration. Then about 50-53% of the amount of total solvent that was initially added was distilled from the mixture. The material started to crystallize at this time. When the desired amount of solvent was distilled off, the batch was cooled to less than 10°C. The crystals were isolated by filtration and then washed with 2 - 2.5 mL of acetonitrile per gram of crude compound (Via) 10-15°C. The crystals were dried at 65°C under vacuum for 12-20 hours. The recrystallization recovered about 92% (on average) with a purity >94% by assay. Table 4 shows the results of the recrystallization of compound (VIa). The alkene that ultimately forms Impurity D was partially removed from the mother liquor during this recrystallization. This recrystallizaiton also significantly reduced the levels of compound (VIc) (see Example 11) (e.g., initially 13% by area percent was reduced to less than <1%). Table 4.

The by-product is compound (VIc) as depicted below: To determine whether compound (VIc) could be converted to compound (VIa) and, thereby, increase the overall yield of compound (VIa), the following example was devised. First Sample. To a Hastelloy C-276 reactor, 16.2 g of potassium hydroxide (KOH) pellets and 72.5 mL of diethylene glycol (DEG) were added. The mixture was stirred and heated (to about 80°-113°C) to dissolve the KOH. Then 14.5 g of compound (VIc) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 185°C for 5.25 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to about 90°C. Approximately 500 mL of deionized water was added to the reaction mixture, and the pH of the reaction mixture (∼13.8) was adjusted to pH 8.6 by the addition of about 9 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and the solids were filtered off. The solids were re-slurried in water and heated to about 50-80°C with agitation for about 1 hour. After the re-slurry cooled to room temperature, the solids were filtered off and dried to produce 11.3 g of compound (VIa). HPLC analysis revealed an assay of about 90 wt/wt % and a molar yield of about 80%. Second Sample. KOH pellets (12.5 g) and DEG (56.15 mL) were added to a Hastelloy C-276 reactor, and the mixture was stirred and heated (to about 80°-108°C) to dissolve the KOH. Then 11.23 g of compound (VIc) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 185°C for about 4.5 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to about 90°C and diluted with 500 mL of deionized water. The mixture was filtered to remove any solids, and the pH of the filtrate (∼13.47) was adjusted to pH 8.66 by the addition of about 7.5 mL of sulfuric acid. The solids were filtered off and processed essentially as described in the first run. The product, compound (VIa) had an assay of about 92.5 wt/wt % and a molar yield of 73%. Third Sample. KOH pellets (6.95 g) and DEG (52.9 mL) were added to a Hastelloy C-276 reactor, and the mixture was stirred and heated (to about 90°-118°C). Then 10.58 g of compound (VIc) was added and the reaction mixture was heated to 185°C for about 4 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to about 90°C, diluted with 300 mL of deionized water, stirred for several minutes, and then another 300 mL of water was added. The pH of the mixture (∼12.80) was adjusted to pH 8.04 by the addition of about 3 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid. The solids were filtered off and processed essentially as described in the first run. Compound (VIa) had an assay of 91.0 wt/wt % and a molar yield of 65%. Example 12: Synthesis of Compound (VIIa) - Alkylation in Acetone The following examples details the alkylation of compound (VIa) to produce buprenorphine or compound (VIIa) (CA index name = 17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-α-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4,5-epoxy-18,19-dihydro-3-hydroxy-6-methoxy-α-methyl-6,14-ethenomorphinan-7-methanol). Alkylation was performed in the presence of acetone. Table 5 lists the reactants for this reaction. A mixture of 8.0 g of compound (VIa), 4.25 g of KHCO3, 4.58 g (1.1 eq to bromide) of KI and 95 mL of acetone plus 0.8 mL water was charged to a 500mL flask with a mechanical stirrer and a condenser. Then 3.39 g of cyclopropylmethyl bromide(CPM-Br) (d = 1.392) was measured out into a stoppered container and washed into the reaction flask with the remaining 5 mL of acetone. The mixture was refluxed under nitrogen for 6-8 hours. If TLC indicated an incomplete reaction, it was refluxed for another 2 hours, and then cooled to room temperature. Table 5.

The mixture was heated to 55-58°C. It was stirred at that temperature for 20 minutes and then allowed to cool to 20-30°C. The mixture was filtered. The reactor and solid was washed with water (2 x 30 mL, about 4 mL per g of starting compound in each wash). The vacuum was turned off and 30 mL of acetonitrile was poured onto the solid and allowed to stand for a minute. Vacuum was applied to the funnel for five minutes. The sample was dried to a constant weight. The yield of compound (VIIa) was 90%, with a range of 89-91% in lab examples. With this method of isolation, the crude product typically had greater than 93 w/w% purity. It was then recrystallized to remove any remaining impurities. Crude products had these levels of purities when cyclopropylmethyl bromide(CPM-Br) with sufficient purity (i.e., low levels of 4-bromo-1-butene) was used. Table 6 presents the purity levels of different samples in which when three different grades of CPM-Br were used: Table 6.

For this, a mixture of 4.04 g of compound (VIa), 2.14 g of KHCO3, 2.24 g of KI, 1.2 mL of CPM-Br, and 60 mL of acetone was refluxed for 6.5h and then stirred overnight. To the mixture was added 80 mL of water to give a precipitate. Acetone was distilled out to a head temperature of 70°C. The pot was cooled to room temperature and 80 mL dichloromethane was added with stirring. Layers were separated. The water was extracted with 10 mL of dichloromethane. To the combined dichloromethane extracts in a clean flask was added 55 mL of acetonitrile. The mixture was distilled to a head temperature of 74°C, collecting 80 mL. At this point some solid was seen. The mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and filtered. The flask and solid were washed with 5 mL acetonitrile. The solid was dried in vacuo to 3.19g (70-71%). HPLC analysis indicated 99.2% compound (VIIa), 0.05% Impurity A, and 0.39% compound (Via). The mother liquor in acetonitrile had 4% compound (Via) and 60% compound (Vila). This material would need to be recrystallized using the method of Example 15 to give passing material with all impurities under 0.15%. Example 13: Synthesis of Compound (VIIa) - Alkylation in Dimethylformamide The alkylation reaction was also performed in the presence of dimethylformamide (DMF). Table 8 presents the reagents used in this reaction. A mixture of 5.05 g of compound (VIa), 20 mL of DMF and 2.00 g NaHCO3 was stirred and heated to 62°C. At this point the solids were mixed and partially dissolved. Cyclopropylmethyl bromide (having 0.07% of the alkenyl impurity), 1.6mL, was added, and the mixture was taken to 85°C and held at this temperature for 5.5 hours. Table 8.

Some of the product could be slightly gummy solid, especially on the stirrer blade. The reaction flask was rinsed two times with 1 mL of DMF, which was added to the flask. The solid obtained was filtered and washed with 50 mL of water. [In some trials, if the dried material after this wash appeared to be a good solid, it was taken directly to the hydrochloride step.] The solid batch was scooped back to the same flask and briefly boiled with 75 mL of water, then allowed to cool with stirring, to remove some residual DMF. Filtration gave a brown solid, 5.42g (94% yield) that after drying in vacuo had 89.5% area% purity. The level of impurity A was 0.16% and the level of compound (VIa) was 0.48%. The material was not recrystallized. The purity of the product prepared in DMF was similar to those prepared above in Example 11. A major difference, however, was that the temperature of the reaction had to be increased to 85°C for a complete reaction to occur. Additional samples were alkylated in DMF using CPM-Br with different levels of the 4-bromo-1-butene impurity. The final product had different levels of Impurity A, as shown in Table 9. Table 9.

The different lots had varying levels of the alkenyl impurity, 4-bromo-1-butene. This impurity alkylates in a side reaction and results in varying levels of Impurity A, as shown in the reaction scheme below: Experimental data showed that the amount of Impurity A produced is statistically related to the level of the butenyl impurity in the alkylating agent (e.g., CPM-Br). Lower levels of the butenyl impurity result in lower Impurity A levels, as the results in Table 10 show. In particular, when Lot 26 (which had a butenyl impurity level of 0.14%) was used, the acetone alkylations yielded Impurity A levels of between 0.05 and 0.06%. In contrast, using the same lot, but running the alkylation in DMF, yielded the higher Impurity A level of 0.12%. Table 8.

This relatively clean crude product allows for recrystallization of the crude solid and therefore avoids the need for chromatographic separations. Avoiding a chromatographic separation reduces both manufacturing costs and time. Recrystallization involves the dissolution of compound (VIIa) in acetonitrile followed by distillation to optimize the recovery. The recovery after recrystallization is typically 90-92%. The recrystallization of the crude compound (VIIa) can remove 17-20% of Impurity A. If a second recrystallization is performed, the level of Impurity A can be reduced by another 6%. In addition, Impurity E may be removed by recrystallization. The following example presents the recrystallization of several samples of crude compound (VIIa) that had an Impurity A level of 0.02%. Compound (VIIa) (45.05 g) was added to 1295 mL of acetonitrile charged to a 2-L jacketed reactor equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a condenser. The mixture was heated to 75-80 °C to dissolve the solids. [If clarification by filtration would be required, then a rinse of warm acetonitrile would also be required to recover compound (VIIa) in the filtration set up.] The solution was then set up for distillation to remove 60-70% of the solvent, with a target of 68% desired for optimal recovery. In this example, 890 mL was distilled from the batch. The batch was then cooled to <10°C and stirred for 30 minutes. The batch was filtered and washed with 75 mL of cold acetonitrile. The sample was dried to a constant weight. The yield was 94%, with a range of 90-94% in lab examples. The weight assay of compound (VIIa) was 99.77%, with Impurity A at 0.014%. The sum of all other impurities was 0.37 by area percent. Additional samples of compound (VIIa) were subjected to a first and a second recrystallization to determine whether the level of Impurity A could be reduced further. The results are shown in Table 11. Table 11.

The synthesis results in the formation of two side products, shown in the reaction scheme below: The bromocyclobutane side product is unreactive, while the 4-bromo-1-butene side product should be below 0.5% for use in the alkylations described above. If the CPM-Br is not pure enough (i.e., less than 0.5% of the butenyl impurity), the CPM-Br can be further purified. Because CPM-Br and the butenyl impurity have a narrow boiling point range, fractional distillation was used to separate the two. The distillation system utilized a >5 plate Oldershaw distillation column with a controlled splitter apparatus. The distillation was performed under reduced pressure and low temperature in a batch process. The recovery was typically 45-64%, operated at 39-40°C and 47-52 millibar. The butenyl bromide was distilled forward and the CPM-Br with increased purity remained in the distillation vessel. Split ratios of 1.5:1 to 4:1 may be used. Results of the distillation process are shown in Table 13 below. Table 13.

Compound (Ia) was reacted with methyl vinyl ketone by heating at reflux in isopropanol/and water to produce compound (IIa). The double bond in compound (IIa) was reduced to yield compound (IIIa). The hydrogenation was carried out in isopropyl acetate at 70-75°C and 30-35 psig with 5% palladium on carbon. The acetyl group of compound (IIIa) was reacted with tert-butylmagnesium chloride in toluene/tetrahydrofuran at 50-95°C to produce compound (IVa). The N-methyl group of compound (IVa) was replaced with a nitrile group by reaction with cyanogen bromide in chloroform at reflux to form compound (Va). The N-cyano and 3-O-methy groups of compound (Va) were hydrolyzed by reaction with potassium hydroxide in diethylene glycol at about 185°C to form compound (VIa). Compound (VIa) was alkylated by reaction with cyclopropylmethyl bromide in acetone at mild reflux to produce compound (VIIa). Compound (Vila) was purified by recrystallization.
