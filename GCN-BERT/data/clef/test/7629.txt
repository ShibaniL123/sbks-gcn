The present invention is directed to a new soft propylene copolymer as well as to extrusion blow molded articles comprising the new soft propylene copolymer. Polymers are increasingly used in different demanding applications. At the same time there is a continuous seek for tailored polymers which meet the requirements of these applications. The demands can be challenging, since many polymer properties are directly or indirectly interrelated. For instance, heterophasic systems are known for their good impact behavior. Such heterophasic propylene copolymers comprise a matrix being either a propylene homopolymer or a random propylene copolymer in which an elastomeric copolymer is dispersed. Thus the polypropylene matrix contains (finely) dispersed inclusions being not part of the matrix and said inclusions contain the elastomeric copolymer. The term “inclusion” according indicates that the matrix and the inclusion form different phases within the heterophasic system, said inclusions are for instance visible by high resolution microscopy, like electron microscopy or atomic force microscopy, or by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). Specifically in DMTA the presence of a multiphase structure can be identified by the presence of at least two distinct glass transition temperatures. Soft heterophasic systems which enable a skilled artisan to produce transparent and sterilisable extrusion blow moulded articles are still a challenge. A specific soft heterophasic propylene copolymer is described in WO 2008/141934 A1. This heterophasic propylene copolymer has a rather low melting temperature and low stiffness. However in the field of extrusion blow molded articles good optical properties are required. It had become clear in the meantime that haze should not be the only value to be used for judging the quality of the optical properties of extrusion blow molded articles. For instance it has been recognized that the visual appearance of extrusion molded articles is inacceptable even though the haze values have been rather low. Thus it became clear that the haze values alone were not enough to judge the optical appearance of the bottles and hence a new parameter, the so-called bottle appearance factor (BAF), was defined as BAF=(clarity*gloss)/haze. Beside the optical properties the hexane soluble content of soft heterophasic propylene copolymers is a critical issue. However a low hexane content is an indispensable requirement in the food and health sector. Accordingly it is the object of the present invention to provide a propylene copolymer with good optical properties, i.e. with a high BAF value, paired with an acceptable hexane content. The finding of the present invention is to provide a propylene copolymer with rather high overall comonomer content but moderate xylene cold soluble (XCS) content. Further the propylene content in the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction should be rather high. A further finding is that especially good results are obtained if the matrix of the propylene copolymer is feature by a bimodal commoner content and molecular weight distribution. Accordingly, in a first aspect the present invention is directed to a propylene copolymer having (a) a melt flow rate MFR2 (230° C.) measured according to ISO 1133 in the range of more than 0.8 to below 2.5 g/10 min, (b) a xylene cold soluble content (XCS) determined according ISO 16152 (25° C.) in the range of 25.0 to 35.0 wt.-%, and (c) a comonomer content in the range of more than 4.5 to 10.0 wt.-%, wherein further (d) the comonomer content of xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of the propylene copolymer is in the range of 12.0 to 22.0 wt.-%, and (e) the intrinsic viscosity (IV) determined according to DIN ISO 1628/1 (in decalin at 135° C.) of the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of the propylene copolymer is in the range of more than 1.5 to below 3.0 dl/g Preferably the xylene cold insoluble (XCI) fraction of the propylene copolymer according to the first aspect has a polydispersity (Mw/Mn) of more than 4.9 to 10.0. In a second aspect the present invention is directed to a propylene copolymer having (a) a melt flow rate MFR2 (230° C.) measured according to ISO 1133 in the range of more than 0.8 to below 2.5 g/10 min, (b) a xylene cold soluble content (XCS) determined according ISO 16152 (25° C.) in the range of 25.0 to 35.0 wt.-%, and (c) a comonomer content in the range of more than 4.5 to 10.0 wt.-%, wherein further (d) the comonomer content of xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of the propylene copolymer is in the range of 12.0 to 22.0 wt.-%, and (e) the xylene cold insoluble (XCI) fraction of the propylene copolymer has a polydispersity (Mw/Mn) of more than 4.9 to 10.0. Preferably the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of the propylene copolymer according to the second aspect has an intrinsic viscosity (IV) determined according to DIN ISO 1628/1 (in decalin at 135° C.) is in the range of more than 1.5 to below 3.0 dl/g. Preferably, the propylene copolymer according to the first and second embodiment is α-nucleated, i.e. comprises an α-nucleating agent. It has surprisingly been found that such propylene copolymer has very high BAF values and relatively low hexane solubles. In the following the first aspect and second aspect of the present invention are defined in more detail together. The propylene copolymer comprises apart from propylene also comonomers. Preferably the propylene copolymer comprises apart from propylene ethylene and/or C4 to C12 α-olefins. Accordingly the term “propylene copolymer” according to this invention is understood as a polypropylene comprising, preferably consisting of, units derivable from (a) propylene and (b) ethylene and/or C4 to C12 α-olefins. Thus the propylene copolymer according to this invention comprises monomers copolymerizable with propylene, for example comonomers such as ethylene and/or C4 to C12 α-olefins, in particular ethylene and/or C4 to C8 α-olefins, e.g. 1-butene and/or 1-hexene.

Further it is appreciated that the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of the propylene copolymer is specified by its intrinsic viscosity. A low intrinsic viscosity (IV) value reflects a low weight average molecular weight. For the present invention it is preferably required that the xylene cold soluble fraction (XCS) of propylene copolymer has an intrinsic viscosity (IV) measured according to ISO 1628/1 (at 135° C. in decalin) in the range of 1.5 to 3.0 dl/g, like in the range of 1.7 to below 2.8 dl/g, more preferably in the range of 1.8 to 2.7 dl/g.

On the other hand the propylene copolymer is also preferably featured by a rather high amount of a crystalline fraction melting at high temperature. Accordingly the instant propylene copolymer is a mixture of a crystalline polymer and amorphous material. Such type of polymer is classified as heterophasic propylene copolymer. A heterophasic propylene copolymer comprises a polymer matrix, like a (semi)crystalline polypropylene, in which the amorphous material, like an elastomeric propylene copolymer, is dispersed. Thus in a preferred embodiment the instant propylene copolymer is heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO). More precisely the instant propylene copolymer is heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO) comprising a matrix (M) being a random propylene copolymer (R-PP) and dispersed therein an elastomeric propylene copolymer (E). Thus the matrix (M) contains (finely) dispersed inclusions being not part of the matrix (M) and said inclusions contain the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E). The term “inclusion” according to this invention shall preferably indicate that the matrix and the inclusion form different phases within the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), said inclusions are for instance visible by high resolution microscopy, like electron microscopy or atomic force microscopy, or by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA).

In other words the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO) may contain further additives, especially α-nucleating agents, but no other polymer in an amount exceeding 5 wt-%, more preferably exceeding 3 wt.-%, like exceeding 1 wt.-%, based on the total heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO). One additional polymer which may be present in such low amounts is a polyethylene which is a by-reaction product obtained by the preparation of heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO) (see in detail below).

Accordingly the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E) comprises monomers copolymerizable with propylene, for example comonomers such as ethylene and/or C4 to C12 α-olefins, in particular ethylene and/or C4 to C8 α-olefins, e.g. 1-butene and/or 1-hexene. Preferably the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E) comprises, especially consists of, monomers copolymerizable with propylene from the group consisting of ethylene, 1-butene and 1-hexene. More specifically the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E) comprises—apart from propylene—units derivable from ethylene and/or 1-butene. Thus in an especially preferred embodiment the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E) comprises units derivable from ethylene and propylene only. It is especially preferred that the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) and the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E) comprises the same comonomers. Accordingly in one specific embodiment the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) and the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E) comprise propylene and ethylene only. The comonomer content of the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E) preferably is not more than 25.0 wt.-%, still more preferably in the range of 12.0 to 25.0 wt.-%, yet more preferably in the range of more than 14.0 to 22.0 wt.-%, even more preferably in the range of more than 15.0 to 20.0 wt.-%. The propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), as defined in the instant invention may contain up to 5.0 wt.-% additives, like α-nucleating agents and antioxidants, as well as slip agents and antiblocking agents. Preferably the additive content is below 3.0 wt.-%, like below 1.0 wt.-% Preferably the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), comprises an α-nucleating agent. Even more preferred the present invention is free of β-nucleating agents. Accordingly, the α-nucleating agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of (i) salts of monocarboxylic acids and polycarboxylic acids, e.g. sodium benzoate or aluminum tert-butylbenzoate, and(ii) dibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1,3:2,4 dibenzylidenesorbitol) and C1-C8-alkyl-substituted dibenzylidenesorbitol derivatives, such as methyldibenzylidenesorbitol, ethyldibenzylidenesorbitol or dimethyldibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1,3:2,4 di(methylbenzylidene) sorbitol), or substituted nonitol-derivatives, such as 1,2,3,-trideoxy-4,6:5,7-bis-O-[(4-propylphenyl)methylene]-nonitol, and(iii) salts of diesters of phosphoric acid, e.g. sodium 2,2′-methylenebis(4,6,-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphate or aluminium-hydroxy-bis[2,2′-methylene-bis(4,6-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphate], and(iv) vinylcycloalkane polymer and vinylalkane polymer (as discussed in more detail below), and(v) mixtures thereof. Such additives are generally commercially available and are described, for example, in “Plastic Additives Handbook”, 5th edition, 2001 of Hans Zweifel. Preferably the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), contains up to 5 wt.-% of the α-nucleating agent. In a preferred embodiment, the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), contains not more than 200 ppm, more preferably of 1 to 200 ppm, more preferably of 5 to 100 ppm of a α-nucleating agent, in particular selected from the group consisting of dibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1,3:2,4 dibenzylidene sorbitol), dibenzylidenesorbitol derivative, preferably dimethyldibenzylidenesorbitol (e.g. 1,3:2,4 di(methylbenzylidene) sorbitol), or substituted nonitol-derivatives, such as 1,2,3,-trideoxy-4,6:5,7-bis-O-[(4-propylphenyl)methylene]-nonitol, vinylcycloalkane polymer, vinylalkane polymer, and mixtures thereof. It is especially preferred the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), contains a vinylcycloalkane, like vinylcyclohexane (VCH), polymer and/or vinylalkane polymer. In one specific embodiment the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), contains a vinylcycloalkane, like vinylcyclohexane (VCH), polymer and/or vinylalkane polymer. Preferably the vinylcycloalkane is vinylcyclohexane (VCH) polymer is introduced into the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), by the BNT technology. The present invention is not only directed to the instant propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), but also to molded articles, preferably blow molded article (extrusion blow molded, injection blow molded or injection stretch blow molded), like extrusion blow molded article, e.g. bottles, like extrusion blow molded bottles, made therefrom. Accordingly in a further embodiment the present invention is directed to a molded articles, like a molded bottle, preferably to a blow molded article, more preferably to extrusion blow molded article, like extrusion blow molded bottle, comprising at least 70 wt.-%, preferably comprising at least 80 wt.-%, more preferably comprising at least 90 wt.-%, still more preferably comprising at least 95 wt.-%, yet more preferably comprising at least 99 wt.-%, of the instant propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO). In one preferred embodiment the molded articles, like a molded bottle, preferably the blow molded article, more preferably the extrusion blow molded article, like extrusion blow molded bottle, consists of the propylene copolymer, i.e. consists of the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO). In one specific embodiment the blow molded article is a blow molded bottle, like an extrusion blow molded bottle. The applied processes for the manufacture of moulded articles are within the knowledge of the skilled person. Reference is made polypropylene handbook, Nello Pasquini, 2rd edition, Hanser. For instance, in the extrusion blow molding (EBM) process a polymer melt is first extruded through a tubular die into air forming a polymer tube, subsequently blowing up said polymer tube (typically called “parison” in this technical field) until the outside of the tube reaches the boundaries of the mold. To cover the wall of the mold fully with the blown up polymer tube is rather difficult compared to injection molding because the air between polymer tube and mold has to be removed totally which is a demanding process step. Further the inside of the polymer tube is not in contact with the mold and therefore there is only little possibility to influence the inner surface structure of the tube. As a consequence thereof extrusion blown molded articles, like bottles, normally show inferior optical properties compared to any injection molded articles. For instance, the surface property inside and/or outside of extrusion blown bottles is typically non-uniform (flow lines, melt fracture) leading to lower overall gloss and transparency compared to injection molded bottles or injection stretched blown molded articles (ISBM). Typically the molded articles (bottles), preferably to a blow molded articles (bottles), more preferably to extrusion blow molded articles (bottles), have a wall thickness in the range of 0.1 to 1.0 mm. The instant propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), is preferably obtained by a specific process. Accordingly the instant propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), is preferably obtained by a sequential polymerization process comprising the steps of (a) polymerizing in a first reactor (R1) propylene andethylene and/or a C4 to C12 α-olefin, preferably ethylene,obtaining a first polymer fraction, i.e. a first random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP1),(b) transferring the first polymer fraction, i.e. the first random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP1), into a second reactor (R2),(c) polymerizing in said second reactor (R2) in the presence of the first polymer fraction, i.e. of the first random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP1), propylene and ethylene and/or a C4 to C12 α-olefin, preferably ethylene,obtaining a second polymer fraction, i.e. a second random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP2), the first and second polymer fraction form the random propylene copolymer (R-PP),(d) transferring said random propylene copolymer (R-PP), into a third reactor (R3),(e) polymerizing in said third reactor (R3) in the presence of the random propylene copolymer (R-PP), propylene andethylene and/or a C4 to C12 α-olefin, preferably ethylene,obtaining a third polymer fraction, said third polymer fraction is the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E); the third polymer fraction and the random propylene copolymer (R-PP), form the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), and(f) removing the propylene copolymer from the third reactor (R3). Preferably between the second reactor (R2), and the third reactor (R3) the monomers are flashed out. The term “sequential polymerization process” indicates that the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), is produced in at least four reactors, preferably in four reactors, connected in series. Accordingly the present process comprises at least a first reactor (R1), a second reactor (R2), and a third reactor (R3). The term “polymerization reactor” shall indicate that the main polymerization takes place. Thus in case the process consists of three polymerization reactors, this definition does not exclude the option that the overall process comprises for instance a pre-polymerization step in a pre-polymerization reactor. The term “consist of” is only a closing formulation in view of the main polymerization reactors. As stated above in the first two reactors the matrix (M), i.e. the random propylene copolymer (R-PP) is produced. More precisely, in the first reactor (R1) the first random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP1) is produced whereas in the second reactor (R2) the second random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP2). The preferred comonomers used in the first reactor (R1) are the same as indicated above, for the first random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP1). Accordingly especially preferred comonomers are ethylene, 1-butene and 1-hexene. In one specific embodiment the comonomer is ethylene. Preferably the weight ratio between the first random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP1) and the second random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP2) is 20/80 to 80/20, more preferably 30/70 to 70/30, yet more preferably 40/60 to 60/40. Accordingly in the first reactor (R1) a first random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP1) is produced whereas in the second rector (R2) the second random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP2) is produced obtaining thereby the random propylene copolymer (R-PP). Concerning the individual properties reference is made to the information provided above. The comonomers of the random propylene copolymer (R-PP), of the first random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP1), and of the second random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP2) copolymerizable with propylene are ethylene and/or C4 to C12 α-olefins, in particular ethylene and/or C4 to C8 α-olefins, e.g. 1-butene and/or 1-hexene. Preferably the random propylene copolymer (R-PP), the first random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP1), and the second random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP2) comprise, especially consist of, monomers copolymerizable with propylene from the group consisting of ethylene, 1-butene and 1-hexene. More specifically the random propylene copolymer (R-PP), the first random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP1) and the second random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP2) comprise—apart from propylene—units derivable from ethylene and/or 1-butene. In a preferred embodiment the random propylene copolymer (R-PP), the first random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP1) and the second random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP2) comprise the same comonomers, i.e. ethylene only. Further the first random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP1), i.e. the polymer of the first reactor (R1), has preferably a xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of equal or below than 10.0 wt.-%, more preferably in the range of 1.0 to 10.0 wt.-%, still more preferably in the range of 2.0 to 9.0 wt.-%, yet more preferably in the range of 2.5 to 8.0 wt.-%. On the other hand the second random propylene copolymer fraction (R-PP2), i.e. the polymer produced in the second reactor (R2), preferably has a xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of equal or less than 40 wt.-%, more preferably in the range of 2 to 35 wt.-%, still more preferably in the range of 3 to 30 wt.-%. Accordingly the overall xylene cold soluble (XCS) content in the second reactor, i.e. the xylene cold soluble (XCS) fraction of the random propylene copolymer (R-PP), preferably equal or below than 20.0 wt.-%, more preferably is in the range of 8.0 to equal or below 20.0 wt.-%, still more preferably is in the range of 10.0 to 18.0 wt.-%. After the second reactor (R2) the matrix (M), i.e. the random propylene copolymer (R-PP), of the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), is obtained. This matrix (M) is subsequently transferred into the third reactor (R3) in which the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E) is produced (step (e)) and thus the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), of the instant invention is obtained. Concerning the individual properties of the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E) and the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), reference is made to the information provided above. Preferably the weight ratio between the matrix (M), i.e. the random propylene copolymer (R-PP), after step (c) and the elastomeric propylene copolymer (E) produced in the step (e) is 60/40 to 90/10, more preferably 70/30 to 85/15. The first reactor (R1) is preferably a slurry reactor (SR) and can be any continuous or simple stirred batch tank reactor or loop reactor operating in bulk or slurry. Bulk means a polymerization in a reaction medium that comprises of at least 60% (w/w) monomer. According to the present invention the slurry reactor (SR) is preferably a (bulk) loop reactor (LR). The second reactor (R2), and the third reactor (R3) are preferably gas phase reactors (GPR). Such gas phase reactors (GPR) can be any mechanically mixed or fluid bed reactors. Preferably the gas phase reactors (GPR) comprise a mechanically agitated fluid bed reactor with gas velocities of at least 0.2 m/sec. Thus it is appreciated that the gas phase reactor is a fluidized bed type reactor preferably with a mechanical stirrer. Thus in a preferred embodiment the first reactor (R1) is a slurry reactor (SR), like loop reactor (LR), whereas the second reactor (R2), and third reactor (R3) are gas phase reactors (GPR). Accordingly for the instant process at least three, preferably three polymerization reactors, namely a slurry reactor (SR), like loop reactor (LR), a first gas phase reactor (GPR-1), and a second gas phase reactor (GPR-2) connected in series are used. If needed prior to the slurry reactor (SR) a pre-polymerization reactor is placed. A preferred multistage process is a “loop-gas phase”-process, such as developed by Borealis A/S, Denmark (known as BORSTAR® technology) described e.g. in patent literature, such as in EP 0 887 379, WO 92/12182 WO 2004/000899, WO 2004/111095, WO 99/24478, WO 99/24479 or in WO 00/68315. A further suitable slurry-gas phase process is the Spheripol® process of Basell. Preferably, in the instant process for producing the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), as defined above the conditions for the first reactor (R1), i.e. the slurry reactor (SR), like a loop reactor (LR), of step (a) may be as follows: the temperature is within the range of 40° C. to 110° C., preferably between 60° C. and 100° C., like 68 to 95° C.,the pressure is within the range of 20 bar to 80 bar, preferably between 40 bar to 70 bar,hydrogen can be added for controlling the molar mass in a manner known per se. Subsequently, the reaction mixture from step (a) is transferred to the second reactor (R2), i.e. gas phase reactor (GPR-1), i.e. to step (c), whereby the conditions in step (c) are preferably as follows: the temperature is within the range of 50° C. to 130° C., preferably between 60° C. and 100° C.,the pressure is within the range of 5 bar to 50 bar, preferably between 15 bar to 35 bar,hydrogen can be added for controlling the molar mass in a manner known per se. The condition in the third reactor (R3), preferably in the second gas phase reactor (GPR-2), is similar to the second reactor (R2). The residence time can vary in the three reactor zones. In one embodiment of the process for producing the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), the residence time the first reactor (R1), i.e. the slurry reactor (SR), like a loop reactor (LR), is in the range 0.2 to 4 hours, e.g. 0.3 to 1.5 hours and the residence time in the gas phase reactors will generally be 0.2 to 6.0 hours, like 0.5 to 4.0 hours. If desired, the polymerization may be effected in a known manner under supercritical conditions in the first reactor (R1), i.e. in the slurry reactor (SR), like in the loop reactor (LR), and/or as a condensed mode in the gas phase reactors (GPR). Preferably the process comprises also a prepolymerization with the catalyst system, as described in detail below, comprising a Ziegler-Natta procatalyst, an external donor and optionally a cocatalyst. In a preferred embodiment, the prepolymerization is conducted as bulk slurry polymerization in liquid propylene, i.e. the liquid phase mainly comprises propylene, with minor amount of other reactants and optionally inert components dissolved therein. The prepolymerization reaction is typically conducted at a temperature of 0 to 50° C., preferably from 10 to 45° C., and more preferably from 15 to 40° C. The pressure in the prepolymerization reactor is not critical but must be sufficiently high to maintain the reaction mixture in liquid phase. Thus, the pressure may be from 20 to 100 bar, for example 30 to 70 bar. The catalyst components are preferably all introduced to the prepolymerization step. However, where the solid catalyst component (i) and the cocatalyst (ii) can be fed separately it is possible that only a part of the cocatalyst is introduced into the prepolymerization stage and the remaining part into subsequent polymerization stages. Also in such cases it is necessary to introduce so much cocatalyst into the prepolymerization stage that a sufficient polymerization reaction is obtained therein. It is possible to add other components also to the prepolymerization stage. Thus, hydrogen may be added into the prepolymerization stage to control the molecular weight of the prepolymer as is known in the art. Further, antistatic additive may be used to prevent the particles from adhering to each other or to the walls of the reactor. The precise control of the prepolymerization conditions and reaction parameters is within the skill of the art. According to the invention the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), is obtained by a sequential polymerization process, as described above, in the presence of a catalyst system comprising a Ziegler-Natta catalyst and optionally an external donor, preferably a catalyst system comprising three components, namely as component (i) a Ziegler-Natta procatalyst, and optionally as component (ii) an organometallic cocatalyst and as component (iii) an external donor represented by formula (IIIa) or (Iamb), preferably represented by formula (IIIa). The process runs especially efficient by using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system, preferably by using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system as defined herein detail below, and a specific comonomer/propylene ratio in the second reactor (R2) and/or in the third (R3) and forth reactor (R4), respectively. Accordingly it is preferred that (a) the comonomer/propylene ratio [Co/C3], like the ethylene/propylene ratio [C2/C3], in the first reactor (R1), i.e. in step (a), is in the range of 1 to 15 mol/kmol, more preferably in the range of 2 to 8 mol/kmol, and/or (b) the comonomer/propylene ratio [Co/C3], like the ethylene/propylene ratio [C2/C3], in the second reactor (R2), i.e. in step (c), is in the range of 10 to 65 mol/kmol, more preferably in the range of 20 to 60 mol/kmol, and/or (c) the comonomer/propylene ratio [Co/C3], like the ethylene/propylene ratio [C2/C3], in the third reactor (R3), i.e. in step (e), is in the range of above 120 to 200 mol/kmol, more preferably in the range of 130 to 180 mol/kmol. In the following the used catalyst is defined in more detail. Preferably component (i) is a Ziegler-Natta procatalyst which contains a transesterification product of a lower alcohol and a phthalic ester. The procatalyst used according to the invention is prepared by a) reacting a spray crystallized or emulsion solidified adduct of MgCl2 and a C1-C2 alcohol with TiCl4 b) reacting the product of stage a) with a dialkylphthalate of formula (I) wherein R1′ and R2′ are independently at least a C5 alkyl under conditions where a transesterification between said C1 to C2 alcohol and said dialkylphthalate of formula (I) takes place to form the internal donor c) washing the product of stage b) or d) optionally reacting the product of step c) with additional TiCl4. The procatalyst is produced as defined for example in the patent applications WO 87/07620, WO 92/19653, WO 92/19658 and EP 0 491 566. The content of these documents is herein included by reference. First an adduct of MgCl2 and a C1-C2 alcohol of the formula MgCl2*nROH, wherein R is methyl or ethyl and n is 1 to 6, is formed. Ethanol is preferably used as alcohol. The adduct, which is first melted and then spray crystallized or emulsion solidified, is used as catalyst carrier. In the next step the spray crystallized or emulsion solidified adduct of the formula MgCl2*nROH, wherein R is methyl or ethyl, preferably ethyl, and n is 1 to 6, is contacting with TiCl4 to form a titanised carrier, followed by the steps of adding to said titanised carrier(i) a dialkylphthalate of formula (I) with R1′ and R2′ being independently at least a C5-alkyl, like at least a C8-alkyl,or preferably(ii) a dialkylphthalate of formula (I) with R1′ and R2′ being the same and being at least a C5-alkyl, like at least a C8-alkyl,or more preferably(iii) a dialkylphthalate of formula (I) selected from the group consisting of propylhexylphthalate (PrHP), dioctylphthalate (DOP), di-iso-decylphthalate (DIDP), and ditridecylphthalate (DTDP), yet more preferably the dialkylphthalate of formula (I) is a dioctylphthalate (DOP), like di-iso-octylphthalate or diethylhexylphthalate, in particular diethylhexylphthalate,to form a first product,subjecting said first product to suitable transesterification conditions, i.e. to a temperature above 100° C., preferably between 100 to 150° C., more preferably between 130 to 150° C., such that said methanol or ethanol is transesterified with said ester groups of said dialkylphthalate of formula (I) to form preferably at least 80 mol-%, more preferably 90 mol-%, most preferably 95 mol.-%, of a dialkylphthalate of formula (II) with R1 and R2 being methyl or ethyl, preferably ethyl, the dialkylphthalat of formula (II) being the internal donor and recovering said transesterification product as the procatalyst composition (component (i)). The adduct of the formula MgCl2*nROH, wherein R is methyl or ethyl and n is 1 to 6, is in a preferred embodiment melted and then the melt is preferably injected by a gas into a cooled solvent or a cooled gas, whereby the adduct is crystallized into a morphologically advantageous form, as for example described in WO 87/07620. This crystallized adduct is preferably used as the catalyst carrier and reacted to the procatalyst useful in the present invention as described in WO 92/19658 and WO 92/19653. As the catalyst residue is removed by extracting, an adduct of the titanised carrier and the internal donor is obtained, in which the group deriving from the ester alcohol has changed. In case sufficient titanium remains on the carrier, it will act as an active element of the procatalyst. Otherwise the titanization is repeated after the above treatment in order to ensure a sufficient titanium concentration and thus activity. Preferably the procatalyst used according to the invention contains 2.5 wt.-% of titanium at the most, preferably 2.2% wt.-% at the most and more preferably 2.0 wt.-% at the most. Its donor content is preferably between 4 to 12 wt.-% and more preferably between 6 and 10 wt.-%. More preferably the procatalyst used according to the invention has been produced by using ethanol as the alcohol and dioctylphthalate (DOP) as dialkylphthalate of formula (I), yielding diethyl phthalate (DEP) as the internal donor compound. Still more preferably the catalyst used according to the invention is the catalyst as described in the example section; especially with the use of dioctylphthalate as dialkylphthalate of formula (I). For the production of the propylene copolymer, i.e. the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), according to the invention the catalyst system used preferably comprises in addition to the special Ziegler-Natta procatalyst an organometallic cocatalyst as component (ii). Accordingly it is preferred to select the cocatalyst from the group consisting of trialkylaluminium, like triethylaluminium (TEA), dialkyl aluminium chloride and alkyl aluminium sesquichloride. Component (iii) of the catalysts system used is an external donor represented by formula (IIIa) or (Iamb). Formula (IIIa) is defined by [in-line-formulae]Si(OCH3)2R25 (IIIa)[/in-line-formulae] wherein R5 represents a branched-alkyl group having 3 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably a branched-alkyl group having 3 to 6 carbon atoms, or a cyclo-alkyl having 4 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably a cyclo-alkyl having 5 to 8 carbon atoms. It is in particular preferred that R5 is selected from the group consisting of iso-propyl, iso-butyl, iso-pentyl, tert.-butyl, tert.-amyl, neopentyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclopentyl and cycloheptyl. Formula (Iamb) is defined by [in-line-formulae]Si(OCH2CH3)3(NRxRY) (Iamb)[/in-line-formulae] wherein Rx and Ry can be the same or different a represent a hydrocarbon group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Rx and Ry are independently selected from the group consisting of linear aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, branched aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms and cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms. It is in particular preferred that Rx and Ry are independently selected from the group consisting of methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, octyl, decanyl, iso-propyl, iso-butyl, iso-pentyl, tert.-butyl, tert.-amyl, neopentyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclopentyl and cycloheptyl. More preferably both Rx and Ry are the same, yet more preferably both Rx and Ry are an ethyl group. More preferably the external donor of formula (Iamb) is diethylaminotriethoxysilane. More preferably the external donor is selected from the group consisting of diethylaminotriethoxysilane [Si(OCH2CH3)3(N(CH2CH3)2)], dicyclopentyl dimethoxy silane [Si(OCH3)2(cyclo-pentyl)2], diisopropyl dimethoxy silane [Si(OCH3)2(CH(CH3)2)2] and mixtures thereof. Most preferably the external donor is dicyclopentyl dimethoxy silane [Si(OCH3)2(cyclo-pentyl)2]. If desired the Ziegler-Natta procatalyst is modified by polymerizing a vinyl compound in the presence of the catalyst system, comprising the special Ziegler-Natta procatalyst (component (i)), the external donor (component (iii)) and optionally the cocatalyst (component (ii)), wherein the vinyl compound has the formula: [in-line-formulae]CH2═CH—CHR3R4 [/in-line-formulae] wherein R3 and R4 together form a 5- or 6-membered saturated, unsaturated or aromatic ring or independently represent an alkyl group comprising 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The so modified catalyst is used for the preparation of the propylene copolymer, i.e. of the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO), according to this invention. The additives as stated above are added to the propylene copolymer, i.e. to the heterophasic propylene copolymer (RAHECO) preferably by extruding. For mixing/extruding, a conventional compounding or blending apparatus, e.g. a Banbury mixer, a 2-roll rubber mill, Buss-co-kneader or a twin screw extruder may be used. The polymer materials recovered from the extruder are usually in the form of pellets. These pellets are then further processed, e.g. by a (blow) mold forming process as described above.

Examples The catalyst used in the polymerization process for examples E1, E2, CE1 and CE2 has been produced as follows: First, 0.1 mol of MgCl2x3 EtOH was suspended under inert conditions in 250 ml of decane in a reactor at atmospheric pressure. The solution was cooled to the temperature of −15° C. and 300 ml of cold TiCl4 was added while maintaining the temperature at said level. Then, the temperature of the slurry was increased slowly to 20° C. At this temperature, 0.02 mol of dioctylphthalate (DOP) was added to the slurry. After the addition of the phthalate, the temperature was raised to 135° C. during 90 minutes and the slurry was allowed to stand for 60 minutes. Then, another 300 ml of TiCl4 was added and the temperature was kept at 135° C. for 120 minutes. After this, the catalyst was filtered from the liquid and washed six times with 300 ml heptane at 80° C. Then, the solid catalyst component was filtered and dried. Catalyst and its preparation concept is described in general e.g. in patent publications EP491566, EP591224 and EP586390.
