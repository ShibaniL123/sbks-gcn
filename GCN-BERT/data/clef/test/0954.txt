CROSS-REFERENCE This application is a national stage entry of PCT/US12/026,406, filed Feb. 23, 2012, which application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/445,999, filed Feb. 23, 2011, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The activity of cells can be regulated by external signals that stimulate or inhibit intracellular events. The process by which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response is referred to as signal transduction. Over the past decades, cascades of signal transduction events have been elucidated and found to play a central role in a variety of biological responses. Defects in various components of signal transduction pathways have been found to account for a vast number of diseases, including numerous forms of cancer, inflammatory disorders, metabolic disorders, vascular and neuronal diseases (Gaestel et al. Current Medicinal Chemistry (2007) 14:2214-2234). Kinases represent a class of important signaling molecules. Kinases can generally be classified into protein kinases and lipid kinases, and certain kinases exhibit dual specificities. Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins and/or themselves (i.e., autophosphorylation). Protein kinases can be generally classified into three major groups based upon their substrate utilization: tyrosine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine residues (e.g., erb2, PDGF receptor, EGF receptor, VEGF receptor, src, abl), serine/threonine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on serine and/or threonine residues (e.g., mTor C1, mTor C2, ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Akt), and dual-specificity kinases which phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine, serine and/or threonine residues. Lipid kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids within cells. These enzymes, and the resulting phosphorylated lipids and lipid-derived biologically active organic molecules, play a role in many different physiological processes, including cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and differentiation. A particular group of lipid kinases comprises membrane lipid kinases, i.e., kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids contained in or associated with cell membranes. Examples of such enzymes include phosphoinositide(s) kinases (such as PI3-kinases, PI4-Kinases), diacylglycerol kinases, and sphingosine kinases. The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) signaling pathway is one of the most highly mutated systems in human cancers. PI3K signaling is involved in many other disease states including allergic contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, disorders related to diabetic complications, and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome. PI3Ks are members of a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3′-OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family comprises 15 kinases with distinct substrate specificities, expression patterns, and modes of regulation (Katso et al., 2001). The class I PI3Ks (p110α, p110β, p110δ, and p110γ) are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors to generate PIP3, which engages downstream effectors such as those in the pathways of Akt/PDK1, mTOR, the Tec family kinases, and the Rho family GTPases. The class II and III PI3-Ks play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P2. The alpha (α) isoform of PI3K has been implicated, for example, in a variety of human cancers. Angiogenesis has been shown to selectively require the α isoform of PI3K in the control of endothelial cell migration. (Graupera et al, Nature 2008; 453; 662-6). Mutations in the gene coding for PI3K α or mutations which lead to upregulation of PI3K α are believed to occur in many human cancers such as lung, stomach, endometrial, ovarian, bladder, breast, colon, brain and skin cancers. Often, mutations in the gene coding for PI3K α are point mutations clustered within several hotspots in helical and kinase domains, such as E542K, E545K, and H1047R. Many of these mutations have been shown to be oncogenic gain-of-function mutations. Because of the high rate of PI3K α mutations, targeting of this pathway may provide valuable therapeutic opportunities. While other PI3K isoforms such as PI3K δ or PI3K γ are expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells, PI3K α, along with PI3K β, is expressed constitutively. The delta (δ) isoform of class I PI3K has been implicated, in particular, in a number of diseases and biological processes. PI3K δ is expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells including leukocytes such as T-cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, mast cells, B-cells, and macrophages. PI3K δ is integrally involved in mammalian immune system functions such as T-cell function, B-cell activation, mast cell activation, dendritic cell function, and neutrophil activity. Due to its integral role in immune system function, PI3K δ is also involved in a number of diseases related to undesirable immune response such as allergic reactions, inflammatory diseases, inflammation mediated angiogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, auto-immune diseases such as lupus, asthma, emphysema and other respiratory diseases. Other class I PI3K involved in immune system function includes PI3K γ, which plays a role in leukocyte signaling and has been implicated in inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune diseases such as lupus. Downstream mediators of the PI3K signal transduction pathway include Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Akt possesses a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds PIP3, leading to Akt kinase activation. Akt phosphorylates many substrates and is a central downstream effector of PI3K for diverse cellular responses. One important function of Akt is to augment the activity of mTOR, through phosphorylation of TSC2 and other mechanisms. mTOR is a serine-threonine kinase related to the lipid kinases of the PI3K family mTOR has been implicated in a wide range of biological processes including cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility and survival. Disregulation of the mTOR pathway has been reported in various types of cancer. mTOR is a multifunctional kinase that integrates growth factor and nutrient signals to regulate protein translation, nutrient uptake, autophagy, and mitochondrial function. Dysregulation of signaling pathways mediated by many other kinases is a key factor in the development of human diseases. Aberrant or excessive protein kinase activity or expression has been observed in many disease states including benign and malignant proliferative diseases, disorders such as allergic contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, disorders related to diabetic complications, and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome. As such, kinases particularly lipid kinases such as PI3Ks and protein kinases such as mTor are prime targets for drug development. The present invention addresses a need in the art by providing a new class of kinase inhibitors.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE All publications, patents, and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent, or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such embodiments are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the invention. It should be understood that various alternatives to the embodiments of the invention described herein may be employed in practicing the invention. It is intended that the appended claims define the scope of the invention and that methods and structures within the scope of these claims and their equivalents be covered thereby. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All patents and publications referred to herein are incorporated by reference. As used in the specification and claims, the singular form “a”, “an” and “the” includes plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. As used herein, “agent” or “biologically active agent” refers to a biological, pharmaceutical, or chemical compound or other moiety. Non-limiting examples include simple or complex organic or inorganic molecule, a peptide, a protein, an oligonucleotide, an antibody, an antibody derivative, antibody fragment, a vitamin derivative, a carbohydrate, a toxin, or a chemotherapeutic compound. Various compounds can be synthesized, for example, small molecules and oligomers (e.g., oligopeptides and oligonucleotides), and synthetic organic compounds based on various core structures. In addition, various natural sources can provide compounds for screening, such as plant or animal extracts, and the like. A skilled artisan can readily recognize that there is no limit as to the structural nature of the agents of the present invention. The term “agonist” as used herein refers to a compound having the ability to initiate or enhance a biological function of a target protein, whether by inhibiting the activity or expression of the target protein. Accordingly, the term “agonist” is defined in the context of the biological role of the target polypeptide. While preferred agonists herein specifically interact with (e.g., bind to) the target, compounds that initiate or enhance a biological activity of the target polypeptide by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target polypeptide is a member are also specifically included within this definition. The terms “antagonist” and “inhibitor” are used interchangeably, and they refer to a compound having the ability to inhibit a biological function of a target protein, whether by inhibiting the activity or expression of the target protein. Accordingly, the terms “antagonist” and “inhibitors” are defined in the context of the biological role of the target protein. While preferred antagonists herein specifically interact with (e.g., bind to) the target, compounds that inhibit a biological activity of the target protein by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target protein is a member are also specifically included within this definition. A preferred biological activity inhibited by an antagonist is associated with the development, growth, or spread of a tumor, or an undesired immune response as manifested in autoimmune disease. An “anti-cancer agent”, “anti-tumor agent” or “chemotherapeutic agent” refers to any agent useful in the treatment of a neoplastic condition. One class of anti-cancer agents comprises chemotherapeutic agents. “Chemotherapy” means the administration of one or more chemotherapeutic drugs and/or other agents to a cancer patient by various methods, including intravenous, oral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravesical, subcutaneous, transdermal, buccal, or inhalation or in the form of a suppository. The term “cell proliferation” refers to a phenomenon by which the cell number has changed as a result of division. This term also encompasses cell growth by which the cell morphology has changed (e.g., increased in size) consistent with a proliferative signal. The terms “co-administration,” “administered in combination with,” and their grammatical equivalents, encompass administration of two or more agents to an animal so that both agents and/or their metabolites are present in the animal at the same time. Co-administration includes simultaneous administration in separate compositions, administration at different times in separate compositions, or administration in a composition in which both agents are present. The term “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” refers to that amount of a compound described herein that is sufficient to effect the intended application including but not limited to disease treatment, as defined below. The therapeutically effective amount may vary depending upon the intended application (in vitro or in vivo), or the subject and disease condition being treated, e.g., the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the disease condition, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The term also applies to a dose that will induce a particular response in target cells, e.g., reduction of platelet adhesion and/or cell migration. The specific dose will vary depending on the particular compounds chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, whether it is administered in combination with other compounds, timing of administration, the tissue to which it is administered, and the physical delivery system in which it is carried. “Treatment”, “treating”, “palliating” and “ameliorating”, as used herein, are used interchangeably. These terms refer to an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including but not limited to therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Also, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the eradication or amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the patient, notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For prophylactic benefit, the compositions may be administered to a patient at risk of developing a particular disease, or to a patient reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though a diagnosis of this disease may not have been made. A “therapeutic effect,” as used herein, encompasses a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit as described above. A prophylactic effect includes delaying or eliminating the appearance of a disease or condition, delaying or eliminating the onset of symptoms of a disease or condition, slowing, halting, or reversing the progression of a disease or condition, or any combination thereof. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to salts derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and organic acids. Inorganic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Organic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be formed with inorganic and organic bases. Inorganic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum, and the like. Organic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, basic ion exchange resins, and the like, specifically such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and ethanolamine. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt is chosen from ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts. “Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” or “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions of the invention is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. “Signal transduction” is a process during which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response. A modulator of a signal transduction pathway refers to a compound which modulates the activity of one or more cellular proteins mapped to the same specific signal transduction pathway. A modulator may augment (agonist) or suppress (antagonist) the activity of a signaling molecule. The term “selective inhibition” or “selectively inhibit” as applied to a biologically active agent refers to the agent's ability to selectively reduce the target signaling activity as compared to off-target signaling activity, via direct or interact interaction with the target. The term “B-ALL” as used herein refers to B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. “Subject” refers to an animal, such as a mammal, for example a human. The methods described herein can be useful in both human therapeutics and veterinary applications. In some embodiments, the patient is a mammal, and in some embodiments, the patient is human. “Radiation therapy” means exposing a patient, using routine methods and compositions known to the practitioner, to radiation emitters such as alpha-particle emitting radionucleotides (e.g., actinium and thorium radionuclides), low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation emitters (i.e., beta emitters), conversion electron emitters (e.g., strontium-89 and samarium-153-EDTMP, or high-energy radiation, including without limitation x-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons. “Prodrug” is meant to indicate a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active compound described herein. Thus, the term “prodrug” refers to a precursor of a biologically active compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, e.g., Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam) A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., “Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,” A.C.S. Symposium Series, Vol. 14, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein. The term “prodrug” is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of an active compound, as described herein, may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide, formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like. The term “in vivo” refers to an event that takes place in a subject's body. The term “in vitro” refers to an event that takes places outside of a subject's body. For example, an in vitro assay encompasses any assay run outside of a subject assay. In vitro assays encompass cell-based assays in which cells alive or dead are employed. In vitro assays also encompass a cell-free assay in which no intact cells are employed. Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures wherein hydrogen is replaced by deuterium or tritium, or wherein carbon atom is replaced by 13C- or 14C-enriched carbon, are within the scope of this invention. The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. When ranges are used herein for physical properties, such as molecular weight, or chemical properties, such as chemical formulae, all combinations and subcombinations of ranges and specific embodiments therein are intended to be included. The term “about” when referring to a number or a numerical range means that the number or numerical range referred to is an approximation within experimental variability (or within statistical experimental error), and thus the number or numerical range may vary from, for example, between 1% and 15% of the stated number or numerical range. The term “comprising” (and related terms such as “comprise” or “comprises” or “having” or “including”) includes those embodiments, for example, an embodiment of any composition of matter, composition, method, or process, or the like, that “consist of” or “consist essentially of” the described features.

A numerical range may be given, e.g., C1-C4 heteroalkyl which refers to the chain length in total, which in this example is 4 atoms long. For example, a —CH2OCH2CH3 radical is referred to as a “C4” heteroalkyl, which includes the heteroatom center in the atom chain length description. Connection to the rest of the molecule may be through either a heteroatom or a carbon in the heteroalkyl chain. A heteroalkyl group may be substituted with one or more substituents which independently are: alkyl, heteroalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, hydroxy, halo, cyano, nitro, oxo, thioxo, trimethylsilanyl, —ORa, —SRa, —OC(O)—Ra, —N(Ra)2, —C(O)Ra, —C(O)ORa, —C(O)N(Ra)2, —N(Ra)C(O)ORa, —N(Ra)C(O)Ra, —N(Ra)S(O)tRa (where t is 1 or 2), —S(O)tORa (where t is 1 or 2), —S(O)tN(Ra)2 (where t is 1 or 2), or PO3(Ra)2, where each Ra is independently hydrogen, alkyl, fluoroalkyl, carbocyclyl, carbocyclylalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, heterocycloalkyl, heterocycloalkylalkyl, heteroaryl or heteroarylalkyl. “Heteroalkylaryl” refers “to an -(heteroalkyl)aryl radical where heteroalkyl and aryl are as disclosed herein and which are optionally substituted by one or more of the substituents described as suitable substituents for heteroalkyl and aryl respectively. “Heteroaryl” or, alternatively, “heteroaromatic” refers to a 5- to 18-membered aromatic radical (e.g., C5-C13 heteroaryl) that includes one or more ring heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur, and which may be a monocyclic, bicyclic, tricyclic or tetracyclic ring system.

The heterocycloalkyl is as described herein and is optionally substituted by one or more substituents described herein as suitable for heterocycloalkyl. “Isomers” are different compounds that have the same molecular formula. “Stereoisomers” are isomers that differ only in the way the atoms are arranged in space. “Enantiomers” are a pair of stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. A 1:1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers is a “racemic” mixture. The term “(±)” is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. “Diastereoisomers” are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms, but which are not mirror-images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog R—S system. When a compound is a pure enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon can be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated (+) or (−) depending on the direction (dextro- or levorotatory) which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that can be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-. The present chemical entities, pharmaceutical compositions and methods are meant to include all such possible isomers, including racemic mixtures, optically pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active (R)- and (S)-isomers can be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. The optical activity of a compound can be analyzed via any suitable method, including but not limited to chiral chromatography and polarimetry, and the degree of predominance of one stereoisomer over the other isomer can be determined. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. “Moiety” refers to a specific segment or functional group of a molecule. Chemical moieties are often recognized chemical entities embedded in or appended to a molecule. “Nitro” refers to the —NO2 radical. “Oxa” refers to the —O— radical. “Oxo” refers to the ═O radical. “Tautomers” are structurally distinct isomers that interconvert by tautomerization. “Tautomerization” is a form of isomerization and includes prototropic or proton-shift tautomerization, which is considered a subset of acid-base chemistry. “Prototropic tautomerization” or “proton-shift tautomerization” involves the migration of a proton accompanied by changes in bond order, often the interchange of a single bond with an adjacent double bond. Where tautomerization is possible (e.g., in solution), a chemical equilibrium of tautomers can be reached. An example of tautomerization is keto-enol tautomerization. A specific example of keto-enol tautomerization is the interconversion of pentane-2,4-dione and 4-hydroxypent-3-en-2-one tautomers. Another example of tautomerization is phenol-keto tautomerization. A specific example of phenol-keto tautomerization is the interconversion of pyridin-4-ol and pyridin-4(1H)-one tautomers. The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. A “leaving group or atom” is any group or atom that will, under the reaction conditions, cleave from the starting material, thus promoting reaction at a specified site. Suitable examples of such groups unless otherwise specified are halogen atoms, mesyloxy, p-nitrobenzensulphonyloxy and tosyloxy groups. “Protecting group” has the meaning conventionally associated with it in organic synthesis, i.e. a group that selectively blocks one or more reactive sites in a multifunctional compound such that a chemical reaction can be carried out selectively on another unprotected reactive site and such that the group can readily be removed after the selective reaction is complete. A variety of protecting groups are disclosed, for example, in T. H. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1999). For example, a hydroxy protected form is where at least one of the hydroxy groups present in a compound is protected with a hydroxy protecting group. Likewise, amines and other reactive groups may similarly be protected. “Solvate” refers to a compound (e.g., a compound selected from Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) in physical association with one or more molecules of a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent. It will be understood that “a compound of Formula I” encompass the compound of Formula I and solvates of the compound, as well as mixtures thereof. “Substituted” means that the referenced group may be substituted with one or more additional group(s) individually and independently selected from acyl, alkyl, alkylaryl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, carbohydrate, carbonate, heteroaryl, heterocycloalkyl, hydroxy, alkoxy, aryloxy, mercapto, alkylthio, arylthio, cyano, halo, carbonyl, ester, thiocarbonyl, isocyanato, thiocyanato, isothiocyanato, nitro, oxo, perhaloalkyl, perfluoroalkyl, phosphate, silyl, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, sulfonamidyl, sulfoxyl, sulfonate, urea, and amino, including mono- and di-substituted amino groups, and the protected derivatives thereof. Di-substituted amino groups encompass those which form a ring together with the nitrogen of the amino group, such as for instance, morpholino. The substituents themselves may be substituted, for example, a cycloakyl substituent may have a halide substituted at one or more ring carbons, and the like. The protecting groups that may form the protective derivatives of the above substituents are known to those of skill in the art and may be found in references such as Greene and Wuts, above. “Sulfonyl” refers to the groups: —S(O2)—H, —S(O2)-(optionally substituted alkyl), —S(O2)-(optionally substituted amino), —S(O2)-(optionally substituted aryl), —S(O2)-(optionally substituted heteroaryl), and —S(O2)-(optionally substituted heterocycloalkyl). “Sulfonamidyl” or “sulfonamido” refers to a —S(═O)2—NRR radical, where each R is selected independently from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl (bonded through a ring carbon) and heteroalicyclic (bonded through a ring carbon). The R groups in —NRR of the —S(═O)2—NRR radical may be taken together with the nitrogen to which it is attached to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. In some embodiments, it is a C1-C10 sulfonamido, wherein each R in sulfonamido contains 1 carbon, 2 carbons, 3 carbons, or 4 carbons total. A sulfonamido group is optionally substituted by one or more of the substituents described for alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl respectively “Sulfoxyl” refers to a —S(═O)2OH radical. “Sulfonate” refers to a —S(═O)2—OR radical, where R is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl (bonded through a ring carbon) and heteroalicyclic (bonded through a ring carbon). A sulfonate group is optionally substituted on R by one or more of the substituents described for alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl respectively. Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., —CH2O— is equivalent to —OCH2—. Compounds of the present invention also include crystalline and amorphous forms of those compounds, including, for example, polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs, solvates, hydrates, unsolvated polymorphs (including anhydrates), conformational polymorphs, and amorphous forms of the compounds, as well as mixtures thereof. “Crystalline form,” “polymorph,” and “novel form” may be used interchangeably herein, and are meant to include all crystalline and amorphous forms of the compound, including, for example, polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs, solvates, hydrates, unsolvated polymorphs (including anhydrates), conformational polymorphs, and amorphous forms, as well as mixtures thereof, unless a particular crystalline or amorphous form is referred to. “Solvent,” “organic solvent,” and “inert solvent” each means a solvent inert under the conditions of the reaction being described in conjunction therewith including, for example, benzene, toluene, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran (“THF”), dimethylformamide (“DMF”), chloroform, methylene chloride (or dichloromethane), diethyl ether, methanol, N-methylpyrrolidone (“NMP”), pyridine and the like. Unless specified to the contrary, the solvents used in the reactions described herein are inert organic solvents. Unless specified to the contrary, for each gram of the limiting reagent, one cc (or mL) of solvent constitutes a volume equivalent. Isolation and purification of the chemical entities and intermediates described herein can be effected, if desired, by any suitable separation or purification procedure such as, for example, filtration, extraction, crystallization, column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography or thick-layer chromatography, or a combination of these procedures. Specific illustrations of suitable separation and isolation procedures can be had by reference to the examples hereinbelow. However, other equivalent separation or isolation procedures can also be used. When desired, the (R)- and (S)-isomers of the compounds of the present invention, if present, may be resolved by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example by formation of diastereoisomeric salts or complexes which may be separated, for example, by crystallization; via formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives which may be separated, for example, by crystallization, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography; selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example enzymatic oxidation or reduction, followed by separation of the modified and unmodified enantiomers; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example on a chiral support, such as silica with a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral solvent. Alternatively, a specific enantiomer may be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting one enantiomer to the other by asymmetric transformation. The compounds described herein can be optionally contacted with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid to form the corresponding acid addition salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable forms of the compounds recited herein include pharmaceutically acceptable salts, chelates, non-covalent complexes, prodrugs, and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, the compounds described herein are in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In addition, if the compound described herein is obtained as an acid addition salt, the free base can be obtained by gasifying a solution of the acid salt. Conversely, if the product is a free base, an addition salt, particularly a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt, may be produced by dissolving the free base in a suitable organic solvent and treating the solution with an acid, in accordance with conventional procedures for preparing acid addition salts from base compounds.

The compounds according to the invention are effective over a wide dosage range. For example, in the treatment of adult humans, dosages from 0.01 to 1000 mg, from 0.5 to 100 mg, from 1 to 50 mg per day, and from 5 to 40 mg per day are examples of dosages that may be used. An exemplary dosage is 10 to 30 mg per day. The exact dosage will depend upon the route of administration, the form in which the compound is administered, the subject to be treated, the body weight of the subject to be treated, and the preference and experience of the attending physician. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention typically contains an active ingredient (e.g., a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or coordination complex thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers, including but not limited inert solid diluents and fillers, diluents, sterile aqueous solution and various organic solvents, permeation enhancers, solubilizers and adjuvants. Described below are non-limiting exemplary pharmaceutical compositions and methods for preparing the same. Pharmaceutical Compositions for Oral Administration In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration containing a compound of the present invention, and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments, the invention provides a solid pharmaceutical composition for oral administration containing: (i) an effective amount of a compound of the present invention; optionally (ii) an effective amount of a second agent; and (iii) a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments, the composition further contains: (iv) an effective amount of a third agent. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may be a liquid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral consumption. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules, a solution, or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier, which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient such as, but not limited to, a binder, a lubricant, an inert diluent, and/or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. This invention further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water may be added (e.g., 5%) in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition may be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions may be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs. An active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the compositions for an oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as suspensions, solutions, and elixirs) or aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations, in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example, suitable carriers include powders, capsules, and tablets, with the solid oral preparations. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof. Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof. Disintegrants may be used in the compositions of the invention to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant may produce tablets which may disintegrate in the bottle. Too little may be insufficient for disintegration to occur and may thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient(s) from the dosage form. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient(s) may be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used may vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration, and may be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant, may be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums or mixtures thereof. Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethylaureate, agar, or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel, a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica, or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added, in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the essential active ingredient therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various combinations thereof. The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil. Surfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, hydrophilic surfactants, lipophilic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. That is, a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants may be employed, a mixture of lipophilic surfactants may be employed, or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant may be employed. A suitable hydrophilic surfactant may generally have an HLB value of at least 10, while suitable lipophilic surfactants may generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non-ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (“HLB” value). Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic, and have greater solubility in oils, while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10, as well as anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly, lipophilic (i.e., hydrophobic) surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10. However, HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial, pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions. Hydrophilic surfactants may be either ionic or non-ionic. Suitable ionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, alkylammonium salts; fusidic acid salts; fatty acid derivatives of amino acids, oligopeptides, and polypeptides; glyceride derivatives of amino acids, oligopeptides, and polypeptides; lecithins and hydrogenated lecithins; lysolecithins and hydrogenated lysolecithins; phospholipids and derivatives thereof; lysophospholipids and derivatives thereof; carnitine fatty acid ester salts; salts of alkylsulfates; fatty acid salts; sodium docusate; acylactylates; mono- and di-acetylated tartaric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; succinylated mono- and di-glycerides; citric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; and mixtures thereof.

In one embodiment, the composition may include a solubilizer to ensure good solubilization and/or dissolution of the compound of the present invention and to minimize precipitation of the compound of the present invention. This can be especially important for compositions for non-oral use, e.g., compositions for injection. A solubilizer may also be added to increase the solubility of the hydrophilic drug and/or other components, such as surfactants, or to maintain the composition as a stable or homogeneous solution or dispersion. Examples of suitable solubilizers include, but are not limited to, the following: alcohols and polyols, such as ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, benzyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butanediols and isomers thereof, glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, transcutol, dimethyl isosorbide, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyvinylalcohol, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and other cellulose derivatives, cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin derivatives; ethers of polyethylene glycols having an average molecular weight of about 200 to about 6000, such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol PEG ether (glycofurol) or methoxy PEG; amides and other nitrogen-containing compounds such as 2-pyrrolidone, 2-piperidone, epsilon.-caprolactam, N-alkylpyrrolidone, N-hydroxyalkylpyrrolidone, N-alkylpiperidone, N-alkylcaprolactam, dimethylacetamide and polyvinylpyrrolidone; esters such as ethyl propionate, tributylcitrate, acetyl triethylcitrate, acetyl tributyl citrate, triethylcitrate, ethyl oleate, ethyl caprylate, ethyl butyrate, triacetin, propylene glycol monoacetate, propylene glycol diacetate, ε-caprolactone and isomers thereof, δ-valerolactone and isomers thereof, β-butyrolactone and isomers thereof; and other solubilizers known in the art, such as dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl isosorbide, N-methylpyrrolidones, monooctanoin, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and water.

The amount of solubilizer that can be included is not particularly limited. The amount of a given solubilizer may be limited to a bioacceptable amount, which may be readily determined by one of skill in the art. In some circumstances, it may be advantageous to include amounts of solubilizers far in excess of bioacceptable amounts, for example to maximize the concentration of the drug, with excess solubilizer removed prior to providing the composition to a patient using conventional techniques, such as distillation or evaporation. Thus, if present, the solubilizer can be in a weight ratio of 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%, or up to about 200% by weight, based on the combined weight of the drug, and other excipients. If desired, very small amounts of solubilizer may also be used, such as 5%, 2%, 1% or even less. Typically, the solubilizer may be present in an amount of about 1% to about 100%, more typically about 5% to about 25% by weight. The composition can further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable additives and excipients. Such additives and excipients include, without limitation, detackifiers, anti-foaming agents, buffering agents, polymers, antioxidants, preservatives, chelating agents, viscomodulators, tonicifiers, flavorants, colorants, odorants, opacifiers, suspending agents, binders, fillers, plasticizers, lubricants, and mixtures thereof. In addition, an acid or a base may be incorporated into the composition to facilitate processing, to enhance stability, or for other reasons. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable bases include amino acids, amino acid esters, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium aluminum silicate, synthetic aluminum silicate, synthetic hydrotalcite, magnesium aluminum hydroxide, diisopropylethylamine, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, triethanolamine, triethylamine, triisopropanolamine, trimethylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) and the like.

Aqueous solutions in saline are also conventionally used for injection. Ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like (and suitable mixtures thereof), cyclodextrin derivatives, and vegetable oils may also be employed. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, for the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants.

Compositions of the present invention can be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, or liquid forms suitable for local or topical administration, such as gels, water soluble jellies, creams, lotions, suspensions, foams, powders, slurries, ointments, solutions, oils, pastes, suppositories, sprays, emulsions, saline solutions, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-based solutions. In general, carriers with higher densities are capable of providing an area with a prolonged exposure to the active ingredients. In contrast, a solution formulation may provide more immediate exposure of the active ingredient to the chosen area. The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients, which are compounds that allow increased penetration of, or assist in the delivery of, therapeutic molecules across the stratum corneum permeability barrier of the skin. There are many of these penetration-enhancing molecules known to those trained in the art of topical formulation. Examples of such carriers and excipients include, but are not limited to, humectants (e.g., urea), glycols (e.g., propylene glycol), alcohols (e.g., ethanol), fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid), surfactants (e.g., isopropyl myristate and sodium lauryl sulfate), pyrrolidones, glycerol monolaurate, sulfoxides, terpenes (e.g., menthol), amines, amides, alkanes, alkanols, water, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols. Another exemplary formulation for use in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices (“patches”). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of a compound of the present invention in controlled amounts, either with or without another agent. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,023,252, 4,992,445 and 5,001,139. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Pharmaceutical Compositions for Inhalation. Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a face mask tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices that deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner Other Pharmaceutical Compositions.

Preparations for such pharmaceutical compositions are well-known in the art. See, e.g., See, e.g., Anderson, Philip O.; Knoben, James E.; Troutman, William G, eds., Handbook of Clinical Drug Data, Tenth Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2002; Pratt and Taylor, eds., Principles of Drug Action, Third Edition, Churchill Livingston, N.Y., 1990; Katzung, ed., Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, Ninth Edition, McGraw Hill, 20037ybg; Goodman and Gilman, eds., The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Tenth Edition, McGraw Hill, 2001; Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2000; Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, Thirty-Second Edition (The Pharmaceutical Press, London, 1999); all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Administration of the compounds or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular, intraperitoneal or infusion), topical (e.g., transdermal application), rectal administration, via local delivery by catheter or stent or through inhalation. Compounds can also abe administered intraadiposally or intrathecally. The amount of the compound administered will be dependent on the mammal being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to 7 g/day, preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g., by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in a single dose. Typically, such administration will be by injection, e.g., intravenous injection, in order to introduce the agent quickly. However, other routes may be used as appropriate. A single dose of a compound of the invention may also be used for treatment of an acute condition. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in multiple doses. Dosing may be about once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, or more than six times per day. Dosing may be about once a month, once every two weeks, once a week, or once every other day. In another embodiment a compound of the invention and another agent are administered together about once per day to about 6 times per day. In another embodiment the administration of a compound of the invention and an agent continues for less than about 7 days. In yet another embodiment the administration continues for more than about 6, 10, 14, 28 days, two months, six months, or one year. In some cases, continuous dosing is achieved and maintained as long as necessary. Administration of the agents of the invention may continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered for more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, or 28 days. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered for less than 28, 14, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 day. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered chronically on an ongoing basis, e.g., for the treatment of chronic effects. An effective amount of a compound of the invention may be administered in either single or multiple doses by any of the accepted modes of administration of agents having similar utilities, including rectal, buccal, intranasal and transdermal routes, by intra-arterial injection, intravenously, intraperitoneally, parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, orally, topically, or as an inhalant. The compositions of the invention may also be delivered via an impregnated or coated device such as a stent, for example, or an artery-inserted cylindrical polymer. Such a method of administration may, for example, aid in the prevention or amelioration of restenosis following procedures such as balloon angioplasty. Without being bound by theory, compounds of the invention may slow or inhibit the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall which contribute to restenosis. A compound of the invention may be administered, for example, by local delivery from the struts of a stent, from a stent graft, from grafts, or from the cover or sheath of a stent. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is admixed with a matrix. Such a matrix may be a polymeric matrix, and may serve to bond the compound to the stent. Polymeric matrices suitable for such use, include, for example, lactone-based polyesters or copolyesters such as polylactide, polycaprolactonglycolide, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, polyaminoacids, polysaccharides, polyphosphazenes, poly (ether-ester) copolymers (e.g., PEO-PLLA); polydimethylsiloxane, poly(ethylene-vinylacetate), acrylate-based polymers or copolymers (e.g., polyhydroxyethyl methylmethacrylate, polyvinyl pyrrolidinone), fluorinated polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene and cellulose esters. Suitable matrices may be nondegrading or may degrade with time, releasing the compound or compounds. Compounds of the invention may be applied to the surface of the stent by various methods such as dip/spin coating, spray coating, dip-coating, and/or brush-coating. The compounds may be applied in a solvent and the solvent may be allowed to evaporate, thus forming a layer of compound onto the stent. Alternatively, the compound may be located in the body of the stent or graft, for example in microchannels or micropores. When implanted, the compound diffuses out of the body of the stent to contact the arterial wall. Such stents may be prepared by dipping a stent manufactured to contain such micropores or microchannels into a solution of the compound of the invention in a suitable solvent, followed by evaporation of the solvent. Excess drug on the surface of the stent may be removed via an additional brief solvent wash. In yet other embodiments, compounds of the invention may be covalently linked to a stent or graft. A covalent linker may be used which degrades in vivo, leading to the release of the compound of the invention. Any bio-labile linkage may be used for such a purpose, such as ester, amide or anhydride linkages Compounds of the invention may additionally be administered intravascularly from a balloon used during angioplasty. Extravascular administration of the compounds via the pericard or via advential application of formulations of the invention may also be performed to decrease restenosis.

No. 6,166,037 (particularly claims 18 and 19), WO 00/66558 (particularly claim 8), WO 00/66559 (particularly claim 9), WO 04/018425 and WO 04/026873. Anti-microtubule or anti-mitotic agents include phase specific agents active against the microtubules of tumor cells during M or the mitosis phase of the cell cycle. Examples of anti-microtubule agents include, but are not limited to, diterpenoids and vinca alkaloids. Diterpenoids, which are derived from natural sources, are phase specific anti-cancer agents that operate at the G2/M phases of the cell cycle. It is believed that the diterpenoids stabilize the β-tubulin subunit of the microtubules, by binding with this protein. Disassembly of the protein appears then to be inhibited with mitosis being arrested and cell death following. Examples of diterpenoids include, but are not limited to, paclitaxel and its analog docetaxel. Paclitaxel, 5β,20-epoxy-1,2α,4,7β,10β,13α-hexa-hydroxytax-11-en-9-one 4,10-diacetate 2-benzoate 13-ester with (2R,3S)—N-benzoyl-3-phenylisoserine; is a natural diterpene product isolated from the Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia and is commercially available as an injectable solution TAXOL®. It is a member of the taxane family of terpenes. One mechanism for its activity relates to paclitaxel's capacity to bind tubulin, thereby inhibiting cancer cell growth. Paclitaxel has been approved for clinical use in the treatment of refractory ovarian cancer in the United States and for the treatment of breast cancer. It is a potential candidate for treatment of neoplasms in the skin and head and neck carcinomas. The compound also shows potential for the treatment of polycystic kidney disease, lung cancer and malaria. Treatment of patients with paclitaxel results in bone marrow suppression (multiple cell lineages, Ignoff, R. J. et. al, Cancer Chemotherapy Pocket Guide, 1998) related to the duration of dosing above a threshold concentration (50 nM) (Kearns, C. M. et. al., Seminars in Oncology, 3(6) p. 16-23, 1995). Docetaxel, (2R,3S)—N-carboxy-3-phenylisoserine, N-tert-butyl ester, 13-ester with 5β-20-epoxy-1,2α,4,7β,10β,13α-hexahydroxytax-1-1-en-9-one 4-acetate 2-benzoate, trihydrate; is commercially available as an injectable solution as TAXOTERE®. Docetaxel is indicated for the treatment of breast cancer. Docetaxel is a semisynthetic derivative of paclitaxel q.v., prepared using a natural precursor, 10-deacetyl-baccatin III, extracted from the needle of the European Yew tree. The dose limiting toxicity of docetaxel is neutropenia. Vinca alkaloids include phase specific anti-neoplastic agents derived from the periwinkle plant. Vinca alkaloids act at the M phase (mitosis) of the cell cycle by binding specifically to tubulin. Consequently, the bound tubulin molecule is unable to polymerize into microtubules. Mitosis is believed to be arrested in metaphase with cell death following. Examples of vinca alkaloids include, but are not limited to, vinblastine, vincristine, and vinorelbine. Vinblastine, vincaleukoblastine sulfate, is commercially available as VELBAN® as an injectable solution. Although it has possible indication as a second line therapy of various solid tumors, it is primarily indicated in the treatment of testicular cancer and various lymphomas including Hodgkin's Disease, and lymphocytic and histiocytic lymphomas. Myelosuppression is the dose limiting side effect of vinblastine. Vincristine, vincaleukoblastine, 22-oxo-, sulfate, is commercially available as ONCOVIN® as an injectable solution. Vincristine is indicated for the treatment of acute leukemias and has also found use in treatment regimens for Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphomas. Alopecia and neurologic effects are the most common side effect of vincristine and to a lesser extent myelosupression and gastrointestinal mucositis effects occur. Vinorelbine, 3′,4′-didehydro-4′-deoxy-C′-norvincaleukoblastine [R—(R*,R*)-2,3-dihydroxybutanedioate (1:2)(salt)], commercially available as an injectable solution of vinorelbine tartrate (NAVELBINE®), is a semisynthetic vinca alkaloid. Vinorelbine is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, such as cisplatin, in the treatment of various solid tumors, particularly non-small cell lung, advanced breast, and hormone refractory prostate cancers. Myelosuppression is the most common dose limiting side effect of vinorelbine. Platinum coordination complexes include non-phase specific anti-cancer agents, which interact with DNA. The platinum complexes enter tumor cells, undergo, aquation and form intra- and interstrand crosslinks with DNA causing adverse biological effects to the tumor. Examples of platinum coordination complexes include, but are not limited to, cisplatin and carboplatin. Cisplatin, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum, is commercially available as PLATINOL® as an injectable solution. Cisplatin is primarily indicated in the treatment of metastatic testicular and ovarian cancer and advanced bladder cancer. The primary dose limiting side effects of cisplatin are nephrotoxicity, which may be controlled by hydration and diuresis, and ototoxicity. Carboplatin, platinum, diammine [1,1-cyclobutane-dicarboxylate(2-)-O,O′], is commercially available as PARAPLATIN®) as an injectable solution. Carboplatin is primarily indicated in the first and second line treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma. Bone marrow suppression is the dose limiting toxicity of carboplatin. Alkylating agents include non-phase anti-cancer specific agents and strong electrophiles. Typically, alkylating agents form covalent linkages, by alkylation, to DNA through nucleophilic moieties of the DNA molecule such as phosphate, amino, sulfhydryl, hydroxyl, carboxyl, and imidazole groups. Such alkylation disrupts nucleic acid function leading to cell death. Examples of alkylating agents include, but are not limited to, nitrogen mustards such as cyclophosphamide, melphalan, and chlorambucil; alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan; nitrosoureas such as carmustine; and triazenes such as dacarbazine Cyclophosphamide, 2-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H-1,3,2-oxazaphosphorine 2-oxide monohydrate, is commercially available as an injectable solution or tablets as CYTOXAN®. Cyclophosphamide is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, in the treatment of malignant lymphomas, multiple myeloma, and leukemias. Alopecia, nausea, vomiting and leukopenia are the most common dose limiting side effects of cyclophosphamide. Melphalan, 4-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]-L-phenylalanine, is commercially available as an injectable solution or tablets as ALKERAN®. Melphalan is indicated for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and non-resectable epithelial carcinoma of the ovary. Bone marrow suppression is the most common dose limiting side effect of melphalan. Chlorambucil, 4-[bis(2-chloroethyl)amino]benzenebutanoic acid, is commercially available as LEUKERAN® tablets. Chlorambucil is indicated for the palliative treatment of chronic lymphatic leukemia, and malignant lymphomas such as lymphosarcoma, giant follicular lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Bone marrow suppression is the most common dose limiting side effect of chlorambucil. Busulfan, 1,4-butanediol dimethanesulfonate, is commercially available as MYLERAN® TABLETS. Busulfan is indicated for the palliative treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Bone marrow suppression is the most common dose limiting side effects of busulfan.

Carmustine is indicated for the palliative treatment as a single agent or in combination with other agents for brain tumors, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Delayed myelosuppression is the most common dose limiting side effects of carmustine. Dacarbazine, 5-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazeno)-imidazole-4-carboxamide, is commercially available as single vials of material as DTIC-Dome®. Dacarbazine is indicated for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma and in combination with other agents for the second line treatment of Hodgkin's Disease. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia are the most common dose limiting side effects of dacarbazine Antibiotic anti-neoplastics include non-phase specific agents, which bind or intercalate with DNA. Typically, such action results in stable DNA complexes or strand breakage, which disrupts ordinary function of the nucleic acids leading to cell death. Examples of antibiotic anti-neoplastic agents include, but are not limited to, actinomycins such as dactinomycin, anthrocyclins such as daunorubicin and doxorubicin; and bleomycins. Dactinomycin, also know as Actinomycin D, is commercially available in injectable form as COSMEGEN®. Dactinomycin is indicated for the treatment of Wilm's tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia are the most common dose limiting side effects of dactinomycin. Daunorubicin, (8S-cis-)-8-acetyl-10-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-α-L-lyxo-hexopyranosyl)oxy]-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,8,11-trihydroxy-1-methoxy-5,12 naphthacenedione hydrochloride, is commercially available as a liposomal injectable form as DAUNOXOME® or as an injectable as CERUBIDINE®. Daunorubicin is indicated for remission induction in the treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and advanced HIV associated Kaposi's sarcoma. Myelosuppression is the most common dose limiting side effect of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin, (8S,10S)-10-[(3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxy-α-L-lyxo-hexopyranosyl)oxy]-8-glycoloyl, 7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6,8,11-trihydroxy-1-methoxy-5,12 naphthacenedione hydrochloride, is commercially available as an injectable form as RUBEX® or ADRIAMYCIN RDF®. Doxorubicin is primarily indicated for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloblastic leukemia, but is also a useful component in the treatment of some solid tumors and lymphomas. Myelosuppression is the most common dose limiting side effect of doxorubicin. Bleomycin, a mixture of cytotoxic glycopeptide antibiotics isolated from a strain of Streptomyces verticillus, is commercially available as BLENOXANE®. Bleomycin is indicated as a palliative treatment, as a single agent or in combination with other agents, of squamous cell carcinoma, lymphomas, and testicular carcinomas. Pulmonary and cutaneous toxicities are the most common dose limiting side effects of bleomycin. Topoisomerase II inhibitors include, but are not limited to, epipodophyllotoxins. Epipodophyllotoxins are phase specific anti-neoplastic agents derived from the mandrake plant. Epipodophyllotoxins typically affect cells in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle by forming a ternary complex with topoisomerase II and DNA causing DNA strand breaks. The strand breaks accumulate and cell death follows. Examples of epipodophyllotoxins include, but are not limited to, etoposide and teniposide. Etoposide, 4′-demethyl-epipodophyllotoxin 9[4,6-0-(R)-ethylidene-β-D-glucopyranoside], is commercially available as an injectable solution or capsules as VePESID® and is commonly known as VP-16. Etoposide is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents in the treatment of testicular and non-small cell lung cancers. Myelosuppression is the most common side effect of etoposide. The incidence of leucopenia tends to be more severe than thrombocytopenia. Teniposide, 4′-demethyl-epipodophyllotoxin 9[4,6-O—(R)-thenylidene-β-D-glucopyranoside], is commercially available as an injectable solution as VUMON® and is commonly known as VM-26. Teniposide is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents in the treatment of acute leukemia in children. Myelosuppression is the most common dose limiting side effect of teniposide. Teniposide can induce both leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. Other topoisomerase II inhibitors include epirubicin, idarubicin, nemorubicin, mitoxantrone, and losoxantrone. Antimetabolite neoplastic agents include phase specific anti-neoplastic agents that act at S phase (DNA synthesis) of the cell cycle by inhibiting DNA synthesis or by inhibiting purine or pyrimidine base synthesis and thereby limiting DNA synthesis. Consequently, S phase does not proceed and cell death follows. Examples of antimetabolite anti-neoplastic agents include, but are not limited to, fluorouracil, methotrexate, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, thioguanine, and gemcitabine. 5-fluorouracil, 5-fluoro-2,4-(1H,3H) pyrimidinedione, is commercially available as fluorouracil Administration of 5-fluorouracil leads to inhibition of thymidylate synthesis and is also incorporated into both RNA and DNA. The result typically is cell death. 5-fluorouracil is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents in the treatment of carcinomas of the breast, colon, rectum, stomach and pancreas. Myelosuppression and mucositis are dose limiting side effects of 5-fluorouracil. Other fluoropyrimidine analogs include 5-fluoro deoxyuridine (floxuridine) and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate. Cytarabine, 4-amino-1-β-D-arabinofuranosyl-2(1H)-pyrimidinone, is commercially available as CYTOSAR-U® and is commonly known as Ara-C. It is believed that cytarabine exhibits cell phase specificity at S-phase by inhibiting DNA chain elongation by terminal incorporation of cytarabine into the growing DNA chain. Cytarabine is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents in the treatment of acute leukemia. Other cytidine analogs include 5-azacytidine and 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine (gemcitabine). Cytarabine induces leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mucositis. Mercaptopurine, 1,7-dihydro-6H-purine-6-thione monohydrate, is commercially available as PURINETHOL®. Mercaptopurine exhibits cell phase specificity at S-phase by inhibiting DNA synthesis by an as of yet unspecified mechanism. Mercaptopurine is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents in the treatment of acute leukemia. Myelosuppression and gastrointestinal mucositis are expected side effects of mercaptopurine at high doses. A useful mercaptopurine analog is azathioprine. Thioguanine, 2-amino-1,7-dihydro-6H-purine-6-thione, is commercially available as TABLOID®. Thioguanine exhibits cell phase specificity at S-phase by inhibiting DNA synthesis by an as of yet unspecified mechanism. Thioguanine is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents in the treatment of acute leukemia. Myelosuppression, including leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, is the most common dose limiting side effect of thioguanine administration. However, gastrointestinal side effects occur and can be dose limiting. Other purine analogs include pentostatin, erythrohydroxynonyladenine, fludarabine phosphate, and cladribine. Gemcitabine, 2′-deoxy-2′,2′-difluorocytidine monohydrochloride (β-isomer), is commercially available as GEMZAR®. Gemcitabine exhibits cell phase specificity at S-phase and by blocking progression of cells through the G1/S boundary. Gemcitabine is indicated in combination with cisplatin in the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer and alone in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Myelosuppression, including leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, is the most common dose limiting side effect of gemcitabine administration. Methotrexate, N-[4-[[(2,4-diamino-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid, is commercially available as methotrexate sodium. Methotrexate exhibits cell phase effects specifically at S-phase by inhibiting DNA synthesis, repair and/or replication through the inhibition of dyhydrofolic acid reductase which is required for synthesis of purine nucleotides and thymidylate. Methotrexate is indicated as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy agents in the treatment of choriocarcinoma, meningeal leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and carcinomas of the breast, head, neck, ovary and bladder. Myelosuppression (leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) and mucositis are expected side effect of methotrexate administration. Topoisomerase I inhibitors include camptothecins such as camptothecin and camptothecin derivatives. Camptothecin cytotoxic activity is believed to be related to its Topoisomerase I inhibitory activity. Examples of camptothecins include, but are not limited to irinotecan and topotecan. Irinotecan HCl, (4S)-4,11-diethyl-4-hydroxy-9-[(4-piperidinopiperidino)carbonyloxy]-1H-pyrano[3′,4′,6,7]indolizino[1,2-b]quinoline-3,14(4H,12H)-dione hydrochloride, is commercially available as the injectable solution CAMPTOSAR®. Irinotecan is a derivative of camptothecin which binds, along with its active metabolite SN-38, to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex. It is believed that cytotoxicity occurs as a result of irreparable double strand breaks caused by interaction of the topoisomerase I:DNA:irinotecan or SN-38 ternary complex with replication enzymes. Irinotecan is indicated for treatment of metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum. The dose limiting side effects of irinotecan HCl are myelosuppression, including neutropenia, and GI effects, including diarrhea. Topotecan HCl, (S)-10-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-4-ethyl-4,9-dihydroxy-1H-pyrano[3′,4′,6,7]-indolizino[1,2-b]quinoline-3,14-(4H,12H)-dione monohydrochloride, is commercially available as the injectable solution HYCAMTIN®. Topotecan is a derivative of camptothecin which binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents relegation of singles strand breaks caused by Topoisomerase I in response to torsional strain of the DNA molecule. Topotecan is indicated for second line treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the ovary and small cell king cancer. The dose limiting side effect of topotecan HCl is myelosuppression, primarily neutropenia. Hormones and hormonal analogues are useful compounds for treating cancers in which there is a relationship between the hormone(s) and growth and/or lack of growth of the cancer. Examples of hormones and hormonal analogues useful in cancer treatment include, but are not limited to, adrenocorticosteroids such as prednisone and prednisolone which are useful in the treatment of malignant lymphoma and acute leukemia in children; aminoglutethimide and other aromatase inhibitors such as aminoglutethimide, rogletimide, pyridoglutethimide, trilostane, testolactone, ketoconazole, vorozole, fadrozole, anastrozole, letrazole, formestane, atamestane and exemestane useful in the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma and hormone dependent breast carcinoma containing estrogen receptors; progestrins such as megestrol acetate useful in the treatment of hormone dependent breast cancer and endometrial carcinoma; estrogens, androgens, and anti-androgens such as flutamide, nilutamide, bicalutamide, cyproterone acetate and 5α-reductases such as finasteride and dutasteride, useful in the treatment of prostatic carcinoma and benign prostatic hypertrophy; anti-estrogens such as fulvestrant, tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene, droloxifene, iodoxyfene, as well as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMS) such those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,681,835, 5,877,219, and 6,207,716, useful in the treatment of hormone dependent breast carcinoma and other susceptible cancers; and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and analogues thereof which stimulate the release of leutinizing hormone (LH) and/or follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) for the treatment prostatic carcinoma, for instance, LHRH agonists and antagonists such as abarelix, goserelin, goserelin acetate and luprolide. SH2/SH3 domain blockers are agents that disrupt SH2 or SH3 domain binding in a variety of enzymes or adaptor proteins including, PI3-K p85 subunit, Src family kinases, adaptor molecules (Shc, Crk, Nck, Grb2) and Ras-GAP. SH2/SH3 domains as targets for anti-cancer drugs are discussed in Smithgall, T. E. (1995), Journal of Pharmacological and Toxicological Methods. 34(3) 125-32 Inhibitors of Serine/Threonine Kinases including MAP kinase cascade blockers which include blockers of Raf kinases (rafk), Mitogen or Extracellular Regulated Kinase (MEKs), and Extracellular Regulated Kinases (ERKs); and Protein kinase C family member blockers including blockers of PKCs (alpha, beta, gamma, epsilon, mu, lambda, iota, zeta). IkB kinase family (IKKa, IKKb), PKB family kinases, akt kinase family members, and TGF beta receptor kinases. Such Serine/Threonine kinases and inhibitors thereof are described in Yamamoto, T., Taya, S., Kaibuchi, K., (1999), Journal of Biochemistry. 126 (5) 799-803; Brodt, P, Samani, A., and Navab, R. (2000), Biochemical Pharmacology, 60. 1101-1107; Massague, J., Weis-Garcia, F. (1996) Cancer Surveys. 27:41-64; Philip, P. A., and Harris, A. L.

Cancer (2000), 88(1), 44-52. Also of interest for use with the compounds of the invention are Myo-inositol signaling inhibitors such as phospholipase C blockers and Myoinositol analogues. Such signal inhibitors are described in Powis, G., and Kozikowski A., (1994) New Molecular Targets for Cancer Chemotherapy ed., Paul Workman and David Kerr, CRC press 1994, London. Another group of inhibitors are signal transduction pathway inhibitors such as inhibitors of Ras Oncogene. Such inhibitors include inhibitors of farnesyltransferase, geranyl-geranyl transferase, and CAAX proteases as well as anti-sense oligonucleotides, ribozymes and immunotherapy. Such inhibitors have been shown to block ras activation in cells containing wild type mutant ras, thereby acting as antiproliferation agents. Ras oncogene inhibition is discussed in Scharovsky, O. G., Rozados, V. R., Gervasoni, S. I. Matar, P. (2000), Journal of Biomedical Science. 7(4) 292-8; Ashby, M. N. (1998), Current Opinion in Lipidology. 9 (2) 99-102; and BioChim. Biophys. Acta, (19899) 1423(3):19-30. This invention further relates to a method for using the compounds or pharmaceutical composition in combination with other tumor treatment approaches, including surgery, ionizing radiation, photodynamic therapy, or implants, e.g., with corticosteroids, hormones, or used as radiosensitizers. One such approach may be, for example, radiation therapy in inhibiting abnormal cell growth or treating the hyperproliferative disorder in the mammal Techniques for administering radiation therapy are known in the art, and these techniques can be used in the combination therapy described herein. The administration of the compound of the invention in this combination therapy can be determined as described herein. Radiation therapy can be administered through one of several methods, or a combination of methods, including without limitation external-beam therapy, internal radiation therapy, implant radiation, stereotactic radiosurgery, systemic radiation therapy, radiotherapy and permanent or temporary interstitial brachytherapy. The term “brachytherapy,” as used herein, refers to radiation therapy delivered by a spatially confined radioactive material inserted into the body at or near a tumor or other proliferative tissue disease site.

The compounds described herein can be used in combination with the agents disclosed herein or other suitable agents, depending on the condition being treated. Hence, in some embodiments the compounds of the invention will be co-administer with other agents as described above. When used in combination therapy, the compounds described herein may be administered with the second agent simultaneously or separately. This administration in combination can include simultaneous administration of the two agents in the same dosage form, simultaneous administration in separate dosage forms, and separate administration. That is, a compound described herein and any of the agents described above can be formulated together in the same dosage form and administered simultaneously. Alternatively, a compound of the present invention and any of the agents described above can be simultaneously administered, wherein both the agents are present in separate formulations. In another alternative, a compound of the present invention can be administered just followed by and any of the agents described above, or vice versa. In the separate administration protocol, a compound of the present invention and any of the agents described above may be administered a few minutes apart, or a few hours apart, or a few days apart. Administration of the compounds of the present invention can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. An effective amount of a compound of the invention may be administered in either single or multiple doses by any of the accepted modes of administration of agents having similar utilities, including rectal, buccal, intranasal and transdermal routes, by intra-arterial injection, intravenously, intraperitoneally, parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, orally, topically, as an inhalant, or via an impregnated or coated device such as a stent, for example, or an artery-inserted cylindrical polymer. The amount of the compound administered will be dependent on the mammal being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to 7 g/day, preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g., bydividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in a single dose. Typically, such administration will be by injection, e.g., intravenous injection, in order to introduce the agent quickly. However, other routes may be used as appropriate. A single dose of a compound of the invention may also be used for treatment of an acute condition. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in multiple doses. Dosing may be about once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, or more than six times per day. Dosing may be about once a month, once every two weeks, once a week, or once every other day. In another embodiment a compound of the invention and another agent are administered together about once per day to about 6 times per day. In another embodiment the administration of a compound of the invention and an agent continues for less than about 7 days. In yet another embodiment the administration continues for more than about 6, 10, 14, 28 days, two months, six months, or one year. In some cases, continuous dosing is achieved and maintained as long as necessary. Administration of the agents of the invention may continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered for more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, or 28 days. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered for less than 28, 14, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 day. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered chronically on an ongoing basis, e.g., for the treatment of chronic effects. When a compound of the invention, is administered in a composition that comprises one or more agents, and the agent has a shorter half-life than the compound of the invention unit dose forms of the agent and the compound of the invention may be adjusted accordingly. In some embodiments, compounds of the invention are tested to estimate pharmacokinetic properties and expected side effect profile. Various assays are known in the art for this purpose. For example, oral availability can be estimated during early stages of drug development by performing a Caco-2 permeability assay. Further, oral pharmacokinetics in humans can be approximated by extrapolating from the results of assays in mice, rats or monkey. In some embodiments, compounds of the invention show good oral availability across multiple species of organisms. Other assays examine the effect of a drug candidate on liver function and metabolism. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) proteins are the main enzyme involved in metabolizing drugs administered to mammalian organisms. As such, undesired interaction of a drug candidate can be a significant source of adverse drug interactions. Generally, it is desirable for a drug to not interact with CYP isozymes such as CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention exhibits an IC50 of greater than 10 μM for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, or CYP3A4. Additionally, liver microsome and hepatocyte metabolism assays using human preparations can be used to estimate the in-vitro half life of a drug candidate. Cardiac toxicity is also an important consideration in evaluating drug candidates. For example, hERG is the gene coding for the Kv11.1 potassium ion channel, a protein is involved in mediating repolarizing current in the cardiac action potential in the heart Inhibition of the hERG gene product by a drug candidate can lead to an increase in the risk of sudden death and is therefore an undesirable property. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention exhibits less than 10% hERG inhibition when administered at a suitable concentration. Mutagenicity of drug candidate compounds can be assayed via an Ames test or a modified Ames test using e.g., the liver S9 system. In some embodiments, compounds of the invention show negative activity in such a test. Other undesired interactions of a drug candidate can also be ascertained via a receptor panel screen. In some embodiments, no significant interactions are detected for compounds of the invention. The examples and preparations provided below further illustrate and exemplify the compounds of the present invention and methods of preparing such compounds. It is to be understood that the scope of the present invention is not limited in any way by the scope of the following examples and preparations. In the following examples molecules with a single chiral center, unless otherwise noted, exist as a racemic mixture. Those molecules with two or more chiral centers, unless otherwise noted, exist as a racemic mixture of diastereomers. Single enantiomers/diastereomers may be obtained by methods known to those skilled in the art. EXAMPLES Example 1 Synthesis of 5-(3-(pyridin-4-yl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-6-yl)benzo[d]oxazol-2-amine The scheme above describes the synthesis of a compound of the invention. A substituted pyridine such as compound 1-1 is reacted with 2-chloroacetaldehyde, resulting in the halogenated imidazopyridine compound 1-2. Compound 1-2 is coupled to a benzoxazolyl boronic acid ester in Suzuki conditions to produce compound 1-4. Further derivatization of compound 1-4 using, for example, NBS, DMF results in halogenation of the imidazopyridine moiety, which is then further reacted in an additional Suzuki coupling using pyridine boronic acid to result in compound 1-6. Example 2 Synthesis of 2-(4-(8-(2-aminobenzo[d]oxazol-5-yl)-3-methyl-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-1-yl)phenyl)-2-methylpropanenitrile The above reaction scheme illustrates the synthesis of a compound of the invention 2-13. Methylation of starting material 2-1 yields compound 2-2, which is subsequently reduced to the amine 2-3. In a separate reaction, compound 2-4 is converted to a salt, such as an HCl salt, which is then reacted, for example, with 2-nitrovinyl-hydroxylamine to yield compound 2-6. Further cyclization yields compound 2-7. Halogenation with a reagent such as POCl3 results in compound 2-8, which can be coupled with intermediate 2-3 to yield 2-9. The nitro moiety of 2-9 is subsequently reduced to an amine, and a further reaction with 4-nitrophenyl carbonochloridate results in the heterocycle 2-11. The desired compound 2-13 is then prepared by coupling to the benzoxazolyl boronate 2-12, for example in a Suzuki coupling. Example 3 Synthesis of 6-(4-(pyridin-4-yl)quinolin-6-yl)benzo[d]thiazol-2-amine The bicyclic compound 3-2 is prepared from bromoaniline 3-1 using diethyl 2-(ethoxymethylene)malonate or a similar reagent. Deprotection and removal of the carboxylic acid, followed by halogenation using a reagent such as phosphorus oxychloride yields compound 3-5. Derivatization with pyridine boronate in Suzuki coupling conditions yields 3-6, which is reacted in a second Suzuki reaction with a benzothiazolyl boronate to yield compound 3-7. Subsequent heating in hydrochloric acid in a solvent such as methanol results in removal of an acetyl group.

The plate is sealed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. To start the reaction, 3.5 ul of ATP (diluted in 1× reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of 10 μM ATP. The plate is sealed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by adding 5ul of Stop Solution per well and then 5 ul of Detection Mix is added per well. The plate is sealed, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, and then read on an appropriate plate reader. Data is analyzed and IC50s are generated using GraphPad Prism 5.

Next, 8 ul of mTOR diluted in reaction buffer is added per well for a 60 ng/ml final concentration. To start the reaction, 10 ul of an ATP/GFP-4EBP1 mixture (diluted in reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of 10 μM ATP and 0.5 μM GFP-4EBP1. The plate is sealed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.

Example 23 Microsome Stability Assay The stability of one or more subject compounds is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. For example, stability of one or more subject compounds is established by an in vitro assay. In particular, an in vitro microsome stability assay is established that measures stability of one or more subject compounds when reacting with mouse, rat or human microsomes from liver. The microsome reaction with compounds is performed in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Each tube contains 0.1 μL of 10.0 mg/ml NADPH; 75 μL of 20.0 mg/ml mouse, rat or human liver microsome; 0.4 μL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer, and 425 μL of ddH2O, Negative control (without NADPH) tube contains 75 μL of 20.0 mg/ml mouse, rat or human liver microsome; 0.4 μL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer, and 525 μL of ddH2O. The reaction is started by adding 1.0 μL of 10.0 mM tested compound. The reaction tubes are incubated at 37° C. 100 μL sample is collected into new Eppendorf tube containing 300 μL cold Methanol at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes of reaction. Samples are centrifuged at 15,000 rpm to remove protein. Supernatant of centrifuged sample is transferred to new tube. Concentration of stable compound after reaction with microsome in the supernatant is measured by Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Example 24 Plasma Stability Assay The stability of one or more subject compounds in plasma is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. See, e.g., Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom., 10: 1019-1026. The following procedure is an HPLC-MS/MS assay using human plasma; other species including monkey, dog, rat, and mouse are also available. Frozen, heparinized human plasma is thawed in a cold water bath and spun for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm at 4° C. prior to use. A subject compound is added from a 400 μM stock solution to an aliquot of pre-warmed plasma to give a final assay volume of 400 μL (or 800 μL for half-life determination), containing 5 μM test compound and 0.5% DMSO. Reactions are incubated, with shaking, for 0 minutes and 60 minutes at 37° C., or for 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes at 37 C for half life determination. Reactions are stopped by transferring 50 μL of the incubation mixture to 200 μL of ice-cold acetonitrile and mixed by shaking for 5 minutes. The samples are centrifuged at 6000×g for 15 minutes at 4° C. and 120 μL of supernatant removed into clean tubes. The samples are then evaporated to dryness and submitted for analysis by HPLC-MS/MS. Where desired, one or more control or reference compounds (5 μM) are tested simultaneously with the test compounds: one compound, propoxycaine, with low plasma stability and another compound, propantheline, with intermediate plasma stability. Samples are reconstituted in acetonitrile/methanol/water (1/1/2, v/v/v) and analyzed via (RP)HPLC-MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The HPLC conditions consist of a binary LC pump with autosampler, a mixed-mode, C12, 2×20 mm column, and a gradient program. Peak areas corresponding to the analytes are recorded by HPLC-MS/MS. The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 60 minutes relative to the amount remaining at time zero, expressed as percent, is reported as plasma stability. In case of half-life determination, the half-life is estimated from the slope of the initial linear range of the logarithmic curve of compound remaining (%) vs. time, assuming first order kinetics. Example 25 Chemical Stability The chemical stability of one or more subject compounds is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. The following details an exemplary procedure for ascertaining chemical stability of a subject compound. The default buffer used for the chemical stability assay is phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4; other suitable buffers can be used. A subject compound is added from a 100 μM stock solution to an aliquot of PBS (in duplicate) to give a final assay volume of 400 μL, containing 5 μM test compound and 1% DMSO (for half-life determination a total sample volume of 700 μL is prepared). Reactions are incubated, with shaking, for 0 minutes and 24 hours at 37° C.; for half-life determination samples are incubated for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. Reactions are stopped by adding immediately 100 μL of the incubation mixture to 100 μL of acetonitrile and vortexing for 5 minutes. The samples are then stored at −20° C. until analysis by HPLC-MS/MS. Where desired, a control compound or a reference compound such as chlorambucil (5 μM) is tested simultaneously with a subject compound of interest, as this compound is largely hydrolyzed over the course of 24 hours. Samples are analyzed via (RP)HPLC-MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The HPLC conditions consist of a binary LC pump with autosampler, a mixed-mode, C12, 2×20 mm column, and a gradient program. Peak areas corresponding to the analytes are recorded by HPLC-MS/MS. The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 24 hours relative to the amount remaining at time zero, expressed as percent, is reported as chemical stability. In case of half-life determination, the half-life is estimated from the slope of the initial linear range of the logarithmic curve of compound remaining (%) vs. time, assuming first order kinetics. Example 26 Akt Kinase Assay Cells comprising components of the Akt/mTOR pathway, including but not limited to L6 myoblasts, B-ALL cells, B-cells, T-cells, leukemia cells, bone marrow cells, p190 transduced cells, philladelphia chromosome positive cells (Ph+), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, are typically grown in cell growth media such as DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum and/or antibiotics, and grown to confluency. In order to compare the effect of one or more compounds disclosed herein on Akt activation, said cells are serum starved overnight and incubated with one or more compounds disclosed herein or about 0.1% DMSO for approximately 1 minute to about 1 hour prior to stimulation with insulin (e.g., 100 nM) for about 1 minutes to about 1 hour. Cells are lysed by scraping into ice cold lysis buffer containing detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and protease inhibitors (e.g., PMSF). After contacting cells with lysis buffer, the solution is briefly sonicated, cleared by centrifugation, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF and immunoblotted using antibodies to phospho-Akt S473, phospho-Akt T308, Akt, and β-actin (Cell Signaling Technologies). Example 27 Kinase Signaling in Blood PI3K/Akt/mTor signaling is measured in blood cells using the phosflow method (Methods Enzymol. 2007; 434:131-54). The advantage of this method is that it is by nature a single cell assay so that cellular heterogeneity can be detected rather than population averages. This allows concurrent distinction of signaling states in different populations defined by other markers. Phosflow is also highly quantitative. To test the effects of one or more compounds disclosed herein, unfractionated splenocytes, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated with anti-CD3 to initiate T-cell receptor signaling. The cells are then fixed and stained for surface markers and intracellular phosphoproteins. It is expected that inhibitors disclosed herein inhibit anti-CD3 mediated phosphorylation of Akt-S473 and S6, whereas rapamycin inhibits S6 phosphorylation and enhances Akt phosphorylation under the conditions tested. Similarly, aliquots of whole blood are incubated for 15 minutes with vehicle (e.g., 0.1% DMSO) or kinase inhibitors at various concentrations, before addition of stimuli to crosslink the T cell receptor (TCR) (anti-CD3 with secondary antibody) or the B cell receptor (BCR) using anti-kappa light chain antibody (Fab′2 fragments). After approximately 5 and 15 minutes, samples are fixed (e.g., with cold 4% paraformaldehyde) and used for phosflow. Surface staining is used to distinguish T and B cells using antibodies directed to cell surface markers that are known to the art. The level of phosphylation of kinase substrates such as Akt and S6 are then measured by incubating the fixed cells with labeled antibodies specific to the phosphorylated isoforms of these proteins. The population of cells is then analyzed by flow cytometry. The results are expected to show that one or more of the compounds of the present invention are potent and selective inhibitors of one or more members of one or more of PI3K, mTOR, and Akt signaling in blood cells under the conditions tested. Example 28 Colony Formation Assay Murine bone marrow cells freshly transformed with a p190 BCR-Abl retrovirus (herein referred to as p190 transduced cells) are plated in the presence of various drug combinations in M3630 methylcellulose media for about 7 days with recombinant human IL-7 in about 30% serum, and the number of colonies formed is counted by visual examination under a microscope. Alternatively, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are obtained from Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) and negative (Ph−) patients upon initial diagnosis or relapse. Live cells are isolated and enriched for CD 19+ CD34+ B cell progenitors. After overnight liquid culture, cells are plated in methocult GF+H4435, Stem Cell Technologies) supplemented with cytokines (IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CF, Flt3 ligand, and erythropoietin) and various concentrations of known chemotherapeutic agents in combination with either compounds of the present disclosure. Colonies are counted by microscopy 12-14 days later. This method can be used to test for evidence of additive or synergistic activity. The results are expected to show that one or more the compounds of the present invention are potent and selective inhibitors of p190 transduced cell colony formation under the conditions tested. Example 29 In Vivo Effect of Kinase Inhibitors on Leukemic Cells Female recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a γ source in two doses about 4 hr apart, with approximately 5Gy each. About 1 hr after the second radiation dose, mice are injected i.v. with about 1×106 leukemic cells (e.g., Ph+ human or murine cells, or p190 transduced bone marrow cells). These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of about 5×106 normal bone marrow cells from 3-5 week old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs are harvested for analysis Kinase inhibitor treatment begins about ten days after leukemic cell injection and continues daily until the mice become sick or a maximum of approximately 35 days post-transplant. Inhibitors are given by oral lavage. Peripheral blood cells are collected approximately on day 10 (pre-treatment) and upon euthanization (post treatment), contacted with labeled anti-hCD4 antibodies and counted by flow cytometry. This method can be used to demonstrate that the synergistic effect of one or more compounds disclosed herein in combination with known chemotherapeutic agents significantly reduce leukemic blood cell counts as compared to treatment with known chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., Gleevec) alone under the conditions tested. Example 30 Treatment of Lupus Disease Model Mice Mice lacking the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb that opposes PI3K signaling in B cells develop lupus with high penetrance. FcγRIIb knockout mice (R2KO, Jackson Labs) are considered a valid model of the human disease as some lupus patients show decreased expression or function of FcγRIIb (S. Bolland and J. V. Ravtech 2000. Immunity 12:277-285). The R2KO mice develop lupus-like disease with anti-nuclear antibodies, glomerulonephritis and proteinuria within about 4-6 months of age. For these experiments, the rapamycin analogue RAD001 (available from LC Laboratories) is used as a benchmark compound, and administered orally. This compound has been shown to ameliorate lupus symptoms in the B6.Sle1z.Sle3z model (T. Wu et al. J. Clin Invest. 117:2186-2196). Lupus disease model mice such as R2KO, BXSB or MLR/lpr are treated at about 2 months old, approximately for about two months. Mice are given doses of: vehicle, RAD001 at about 10 mg/kg, or compounds disclosed herein at approximately 1 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg. Blood and urine samples are obtained at approximately throughout the testing period, and tested for antinuclear antibodies (in dilutions of serum) or protein concentration (in urine). Serum is also tested for anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA antibodies by ELISA Animals are euthanized at day 60 and tissues harvested for measuring spleen weight and kidney disease. Glomerulonephritis is assessed in kidney sections stained with H&E. Other animals are studied for about two months after cessation of treatment, using the same endpoints. This model established in the art can be employed to test that the kinase inhibitors disclosed herein can suppress or delay the onset of lupus symptoms in lupus disease model mice. Example 31 Murine Bone Marrow Transplant Assay Female recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a γ ray source. About 1 hr after the radiation dose, mice are injected with about 1×106 leukemic cells from early passage p190 transduced cultures (e.g., as described in Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2005 August; 161(1):51-6). These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of approximately 5×106 normal bone marrow cells from 3-5wk old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs harvested for flow cytometry and/or magnetic enrichment. Treatment begins on approximately day 10 and continues daily until mice become sick, or after a maximum of about 35 days post-transplant. Drugs are given by oral gavage (p.o.). In a pilot experiment a close of chemotherapeutic that is not curative but delays leukemia onset by about one week or less is identified; controls are vehicle-treated or treated with chemotherapeutic agent, previously shown to delay but not cure leukemogenesis in this model (e.g., imatinib at about 70 mg/kg twice daily). For the first phase p190 cells that express eGFP are used, and postmortem analysis is limited to enumeration of the percentage of leukemic cells in bone marrow, spleen and lymph node (LN) by flow cytometry. In the second phase, p190 cells that express a tailless form of human CD4 are used and the postmortem analysis includes magnetic sorting of hCD4+ cells from spleen followed by immunoblot analysis of key signaling endpoints: p Akt-T308 and S473; pS6 and p4EBP-1. As controls for immunoblot detection, sorted cells are incubated in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors of the present disclosure inhibitors before lysis. Optionally, “phosflow” is used to detect p Akt-S473 and pS6-S235/236 in hCD4-gated cells without prior sorting. These signaling studies are particularly useful if, for example, drug-treated mice have not developed clinical leukemia at the 35 day time point. Kaplan-Meier plots of survival are generated and statistical analysis done according to methods known in the art. Results from p190 cells are analyzed separated as well as cumulatively. Samples of peripheral blood (100-200 μl) are obtained weekly from all mice, starting on day 10 immediately prior to commencing treatment. Plasma is used for measuring drug concentrations, and cells are analyzed for leukemia markers (eGFP or hCD4) and signaling biomarkers as described herein. This general assay known in the art may be used to test that effective therapeutic doses of the compounds disclosed herein can be used for inhibiting the proliferation of leukemic cells. Example 32 Rat Developing Type II Collagen Induced Arthritis Assay In order to study the effects of the compounds of the present invention on the autoimmune disease arthritis, a collagen induced developing arthritis model is used. Female Lewis rats are given collagen injections at day 0. Bovine type II collagen is prepared as a 4 mg/ml solution in 0.01N acetic acid. Equal volumes of collagen and Freund's incomplete adjuvant are emulsified by hand mixing until a bead of the emulsified material holds its form in water. Each rodent receives a 300 μl injection of the mixture at each injection time spread over three subcutaneous sites on the back. Oral compound administration begins on day 0 and continues through day 16 with vehicle (5% NMP, 85% PEG 400, 10% Solutol) or compounds of the present invention in vehicle or control (e.g., methotrexate) at 12 hour intervals daily. Rats are weighed on days 0, 3, 6, 9-17 and caliper measurements of ankles are taken on days 9-17. Final body weights are taken, and then the animals are euthanized on day 17. After euthanization, blood is drawn and hind paws and knees are removed. Blood is further processed for pharmacokinetics experiments as well as an anti-type II collagen antibody ELISA assay. Hind paws are weighed and then, with the knees, preserved in 10% formalin. The paws and knees are subsequently processed for microscopy. Livers, spleen and thymus are weighed. Sciatic nerves are prepared for histopathology. Knee and ankle joints are fixed for 1-2 days and decalcified for 4-5 days Ankle joints are cut in half longitudinally, and knees are cut in half along the frontal plane.

Percent inhibition of paw weight and AUC was calculated using the following formula: [in-line-formulae]% Inhibition=A−B/A×100[/in-line-formulae] A=Mean Disease Control—Mean Normal B=Mean Treated—Mean Normal The results are expected to show, relative to vehicle only control or to methotrexate control, that the compounds of the present invention exhibit a significant reduction in arthritis induced ankle diameter increase over time, and reduction of ankle histopathology in at least one or more of the categories of inflammation, pannus, cartilage damage, and bone resorption as described above. The results are expected to show that one or more compounds of the present invention may be useful for the treatment and reduction of arthritis disease symptoms. The results further are expected to show a reduction at 10, 20, and 60 mg/kg dosage levels of serum anti-type II collagen levels for selected test compounds, suggesting that one or more compounds of the present invention may not only be useful for the treatment and reduction of arthritis disease symptoms, but may also be useful for the inhibition of the autoimmune reaction itself. Example 33 Rat Established Type II Collagen Induced Arthritis Assay In order to examine the dose responsive efficacy of the compounds of the present invention in inhibiting the inflammation, cartilage destruction and bone resorption of 10 day established type II collagen induced arthritis in rats, compounds are administered orally daily or twice daily for 6 days. Female Lewis rats are anesthetized and given collagen injections prepared and administered as described previously on day 0. On day 6, animals are anesthetized and given a second collagen injection. Caliper measurements of normal (pre-disease) right and left ankle joints are performed on day 9. On days 10-11, arthritis typically occurs and rats arerandomized into treatment groups. Randomization is performed after ankle joint swelling is obviously established and there is evidence of bilateral disease. After an animal is selected for enrollment in the study, treatment is initiated by the oral route. Animals are given vehicle, control (Enbrel) or compound doses, twice daily or once daily (BID or QD respectively). Administration is performed on days 1-6 using a volume of 2.5 ml/kg (BID) or 5 ml/kg (QD) for oral solutions. Rats are weighed on days 1-7 following establishment of arthritis and caliper measurements of ankles taken every day. Final body weights are taken on day 7 and animals are euthanized. The results are expected to show reduction in mean ankle diamter increase over time for selected test compounds under the conditions tested. Example 34 Adjuvant Induced Arthritis Assay Intrathecal Catheterization of Rats Isoflurane-anesthetized Lewis rats (200-250 g) are implanted with an intrathecal (IT) catheter. After a 6 d recovery period, all animals except those that appeared to have sensory or motor abnormalities (generally fewer than 5% of the total number) are used for experiments. For IT administration, 10 μl of drug or saline followed by 10 μl of isotonic saline is injected through the catheter. Adjuvant Arthritis and Drug Treatment Lewis rats are immunized at the base of the tail with 0.1 ml of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) on day 0 several days after catheter implantation (n=6/group). Drug (e.g., one or more compounds of the present invention or or vehicle) treatment is generally started on day 8 and is continued daily until day 20. Clinical signs of arthritis generally begin on day 10, and paw swelling is determined every second day by water displacement plethysmometry. The results are expected to show that one or more compounds of the present invention demonstrates may be useful for the treatment of one or more of the diseases or conditions described herein. Example 35 Rodent Pharmacokinetic Assay In order to study the pharmacokinetics of the compounds of the present invention a set of 4-10 week old mice are grouped according to the following table: Mice/ Compound Administration Group # group (mg/kg) Route Regimen 1 3 1 Po One dose 2 3 3 3 3 10 4 3 30 5 3 60 Compounds of the present invention are dissolved in an appropriate vehicle (e.g., 5% 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, 85% polyethylene glycol 400, 10% Solutor) and administered orally at 12 hour intervals daily. All animals are euthanized in CO2 2 hours after the final compound is administered. Blood is collected immediately and kept on ice for plasma isolation. Plasma is isolated by centrifuging at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes. Harvested plasma is frozen for pharmacokinetic detection. The results are expected to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic parameters such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity for the compounds of the present invention. Example 36 Basotest assay The basotest assay is performed using Orpegen Pharma Basotest reagent kit. Heparinized whole blood is pre-incubated with test compound or solvent at 37 C for 20 min. Blood is then incubated with assay kit stimulation buffer (to prime cells for response) followed by allergen (dust mite extract or grass extract) for 20 min. The degranulation process is stopped by incubating the blood samples on ice. The cells are then labeled with anti-IgE-PE to detect basophilic granulocytes, and anti-gp53-FITC to detect gp53 (a glycoprotein expressed on activated basophils). After staining red blood cells are lysed by addition of Lysing Solution. Cells are washed, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Test compounds, when evaluated in this assay inhibit allergen induced activation of basophilic granulocytes at sub micromolar range. The results are expected to demonstrate that under the conditions tested one or more compounds of the present invention are capable of inhibiting allergen induced activation of basophils. Example 37 Use of the Compounds of the Present Invention for Inhibition of Tumor Growth Cell Lines Cell lines of interest (A549, U87, ZR-75-1 and 786-0) are obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.). Cells are proliferated and preserved cryogenically at early passage (e.g., passage 3). One aliquot is used for further proliferation to get enough cells for one TGI study (at about passage 9). Animals Female athymic nude mice are supplied by Harlan. Mice are received at 4 to 6 weeks of age. All mice are acclimated for about one day to two weeks prior to handling. The mice are housed in microisolator cages and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. The mice are fed with irradiated mouse chow and freely available autoclaved water is provided. Tumor Xenograft Model Mice are inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank with 0.01 to 0.5 ml of tumor cells (approximately 1.0×105 to 1.0×108 cells/mouse). Five to 10 days following inoculation, tumors are measured using calipers and tumor weight is calculated, for example using the animal study management software, such as Study Director V.1.6.70 (Study Log). Mice with tumor sizes of about 120 mg are pair-matched into desired groups using Study Director (Day 1). Body weights are recorded when the mice are pair-matched. Tumor volume and bodyweight measurements are taken one to four times weekly and gross observations are made at least once daily. On Day 1, compounds of the present invention and reference compounds as well as vehicle control are administered by oral gavage or iv as indicated. At the last day of the experiment, mice are sacrificed and their tumors are collected 1-4 hours after the final dose. The tumors are excised and cut into two sections. One third of the tumor is fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin blocks and the remaining two thirds of tumor is snap frozen and stored at −80° C. Data and Statistical Analysis Mean tumor growth inhibition (TGI) is calculated utilizing the following formula: TGI = [ 1 - ( χ _ Treated ( Final ) - χ _ Treated ( Day ⁢ ⁢ 1 ) ) ( χ _ Control ( Final ) - χ _ Control ( Day ⁢ ⁢ 1 ) ) ] × 100 ⁢ % Tumors that regress from the Day 1 starting size are removed from the calculations. Individual tumor shrinkage (TS) is calculated using the formula below for tumors that show regression relative to Day 1 tumor weight. The mean tumor shrinkage of each group is calculated and reported. TS = [ 1 - ( Tumor ⁢ ⁢ Weight ( Final ) ) ( Tumor ⁢ ⁢ Weight ( Day ⁢ ⁢ 1 ) ) ] × 100 ⁢ % The model can be employed to show whether the compounds of the present invention can inhibit tumor cell growth such as renal carcinoma cell growth, breast cancer cell growth, lung cancer cell growth, or glioblastoma cell growth under the conditions tested. Example 38 Inhibition of PI3K pathway and proliferation of tumor cells with PI3Kα mutation Cells comprising one or more mutations in PI3Kα, including but not limited to breast cancer cells (e.g., MDA-MB-361 and T47D), and cells comprising one or more mutations in PTEN including but not limited to prostate cancer cells (e.g., PC3), are typically grown in cell growth media such as DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum and/or antibiotics, and grown to confluency. Cells are then treated with various concentrations of test compound for about 2 hours and subsequently lysed in cell lysis buffer. Lysates are subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis to detect downstream signaling markers, including but not limited to pAKT(5473), pAKT(T308), pS6, and p4E-BP1. Degree of proliferation (and proliferation inhibition) can also be measured for cells at various doses of compound of the present invention. Based on percent inhibition of pAKT and proliferation indicated by these results, IC50 values are calculated. Example 39 In Vitro Inhibition of Angiogenesis Inhibition of angiogenesis in the presence of test compound is evaluated using a tube formation assay, such as by using a tube formation assay kit (e.g., commerically available from Invitrogen). Angiogenic capacity can be measured in vitro using an endothelial cell line, such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The assay is conducted according to the kit instructions, in the presence or absence of compound. Briefly, a gel matrix is applied to a cell culture surface, cells are added to the matrix-covered surface along with growth factors, with some samples also receiving an inhibitor compound, cells are incubated at 37° C. and 5% CO2 long enough for control samples (no compound added) to form tube structures (such as overnight), cells are stained using a cell-permeable dye (e.g., calcein), and cells are visualized to identify the degree of tube formation Any decrease in tube formation relative to un-inhibited control cells is indicative of angiogenic inhibition. Based on doses tested and the corresponding degree of tube formation inhibition, IC50 values for tube formation are calculated. Cell viability can be measured using any number of methods known in the art, such as staining methods that distinguish live from dead cells (e.g., Image-iT DEAD Green viability stain commercially available from Invitrogen). Generally, the results are expected to show that compounds of the invention have a comparable to higher potency with respect to angiogenesis inhibition by comparison to the Pan-PI3K inhibitor, and are achieved with a compound having specificity for PI3K α inhibition. Example 40 In Vivo Efficacy in Xenogenic Mouse Model of Breast Cancer Nude mice harboring tumors derived from implantation of human breast adenocarcinoma cells MDA-MB-361 (PI3Kα/HER2 carcinoma) are separated into untreated control (vehicle only) and treatment groups. Mice in the treatment group are further divided into mice receiving 70 mg/kg (70 mpk) of a Pan-PI3K inhibitor, or mpk or 60 mpk of test compound. Mice in the treatment group receive the defined dose daily by oral lavage for 20 to 50 days, during which time tumor weight is calculated as described in example 37. Blood glucose is monitored periodically following administration of treatment. 2 hours after the final treatment, tumors are harvested and proteins are analyzed by Western blot as described above. The effect of the compounds on the localization/viability of marginal zone B cells in the spleen is also evaluated at the conclusion of treatment. In general, the results are expected to indicate that a compound of the present invention has comparable kinase- and tumor growth-inhibition activity to the Pan-PI3K inhibitor, without the impact on blood glucose seen for the latter. A similar experiment using 786-O cells, a human kidney carcinoma cell line having a non-mutated PI3Kα, instead of MDA cells is used to further demonstrate the specificity of test compounds. For example, a test compound is compared to a kinase inhibitor with specificity for mTor. Example 41 Synergistic Combination with Other Kinase Inhibitors In some embodiments, a compound of the present invention is combined with another kinase inhibitor. In some embodiments, the combined kinase inhibitor is a MEK inhibitor. A median-effect analysis is used to determine synergism, antagonism, or additivity of a compound of the present invention when combined with a MEK inhibitor. The Combination Index (CI) is determined using the Chou/Talalay equation. IC50 values for each individual compound is determined in a 72 hr CellTiter-Glo assay. For combination assays, drugs are used at their equipotent ratio (e.g., at the ratio of their IC50's). CalcuSyn software (by Biosoft) is used for dose effect analysis. To further demonstrate synergy between kinase inhibitors, a cell arrest assay is used to determine the effects of inhibitors alone and in combination on the cycle stage of treated cells. HCT116 cells, a human colon cancer cell line, is treated with DMSO (carrier), 3 μM of a compound of the present invention, 0.3 μM of PD0325901, or a combination of both 3 μM of compound of the invention and 0.3 μM of a MEK inhibitor. Cells are then incubated in the presence of DMSO or inhibitor for 20 hours. The number of cells at each stage in the cell cycle is determined and expressed as a percent of the total, with an increase in the number of cells arrested at pre-G0/G1 indicating effective inhibition of cell cycle progression. The results are expected to indicate that the combination of a compound of the present invention with other inhibitors can be synergistic. 1.
