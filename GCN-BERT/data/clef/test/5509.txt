Latin name of the genus and species: Dianthus plumarius. Variety denomination ‘DIANMAGENT’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The new Dianthus cultivar is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the inventor, Gavriel Danziger, in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel. The objective of the breeding program was to produce new Dianthus varieties for ornamental commercial applications. The cross resulting in this new variety was made during October of 2009. The seed parent is the unpatented, proprietary seedling variety referred to as Dianthus plumarius ‘Acc. 1’ The pollen parent is the unpatented, proprietary seedling variety referred to as Dianthus plumarius ‘Acc. 9’. The new variety was discovered in November of 2010 by the inventor in a group of seedlings resulting from the 2009 crossing, in a research greenhouse in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel. Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar was performed by vegetative tip cuttings. This was first performed at a research greenhouse in Moshav Mishmar Hashiva, Israel in December of 2010 and has shown that the unique features of this cultivar are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The cultivar ‘DIANMAGENT’ has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, day length, and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘DIANMAGENT’ These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘DIANMAGENT’ as a new and distinct Dianthus cultivar: 1. Very floriferous.2. Robust outdoor performance.3. Low maintenance in garden situations.4. Perpetual flowering.5. Hardy to USDA zone 5 Plants of the new cultivar ‘DIANMAGENT’ are similar to plants of the seed parent, Dianthus plumarius ‘Acc. 1’ in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar ‘DIANMAGENT’ is are much more floriferous than the seed parent. ‘DIANMAGENT’ also has a perpetual flowering habit whereas seed parent flowers only in the spring. Additionally, ‘DIANMAGENT’ has a more flexible growth, habit, leaves and stems are not as stiff as the seed parent. Plants of the new cultivar ‘DIANMAGENT’ are similar to plants of the pollen parent; Dianthus plumarius ‘Acc. 9’ in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar ‘DIANMAGENT’ is hardy to USDA zone 5, whereas the pollen parent is less resistant to low temperatures. ‘DIANMAGENT’ is more robust than the pollen parent; generally ‘DIANMAGENT’ is more suitable for a broad range of environmental conditions than the pollen parent. Also ‘DIANMAGENT’ produces smaller flowers that stand above the foliage; the pollen parent's flowering is larger and lower (partially hidden in the foliage). COMMERCIAL COMPARISON Plants of the new cultivar ‘DIANMAGENT’ are comparable to the unpatented, commercial Dianthus variety ‘Gepo’. The two Dianthus varieties are similar in most horticultural characteristics; however, the new variety ‘DIANMAGENT’ produces a semi double, magenta colored flower, whereas comparator ‘Gepo’ produces a single form flower of dark lilac color. ‘DIANMAGENT’ also has a perpetual flowering habit, whereas comparator ‘Gepo’ flowers only in the spring. Additionally ‘DIANMAGENT’ is less compact in habit than comparator ‘Gepo’. Plants of the new cultivar ‘DIANMAGENT’ can also be compared to the unpatented, commercial Dianthus variety ‘Kahori’. These varieties are similar in most horticultural characteristics; however ‘DIANMAGENT’ produces a semi double, magenta colored flower, whereas comparator ‘Kahori’ produces a single form flower of pink-lavender color. ‘DIANMAGENT’ is shorter in height; 20 cm compared to 35 cm of comparator ‘Kahori’. Additionally ‘DIANMAGENT’ has good flower form (open petals) compared to incurved petals of comparator ‘Kahori’. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS The accompanying photograph in FIG. 1 illustrates in full color a typical plant of ‘DIANMAGENT’ grown in a greenhouse, in a 5 inch pot. Age of the plant photographed is approximately 14 weeks from a rooted cutting. FIG. 2 illustrates in full color a close up of a typical bloom of ‘DIANMAGENT’. The photographs were taken using conventional techniques and although colors may appear different from actual colors due to light reflectance it is as accurate as possible by conventional photographic techniques.
