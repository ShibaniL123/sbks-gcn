CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/226,758, filed Sep. 7, 2011 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The present invention relates to controlled release, delayed release, prolonged release, extended release and/or taste masking compositions containing budesonide as active ingredient incorporated in a three-component matrix structure, i.e. a structure formed by successive amphiphilic, lipophilic or inert matrices and finally incorporated or dispersed in hydrophilic matrices. The use of a plurality of systems mechanism for the control of the dissolution of the active ingredient modulates the dissolution rate of the active ingredient in aqueous and/or biological fluids, thereby controlling the release kinetics in the gastrointestinal tract, and it also allows the oral administration of active principles having unfavorable taste characteristics or irritating action on the mucosae of the administration site, particularly in the buccal or gastric area. The compositions of the invention are suitable to the oral administration or the efficaciously deliver the active ingredient acting topically at some areas of the gastrointestinal tract. TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND The preparation of a sustained, controlled, delayed, extended or anyhow modified release form can be carried out according to different techniques: 1. The use of inert matrices, in which the main component of the matrix structure opposes some resistance to the penetration of the solvent due to the poor affinity towards aqueous fluids; such property being known as lipophilia.2. The use of hydrophilic matrices, in which the main component of the matrix structure opposes high resistance to the progress of the solvent, in that the presence of strongly hydrophilic groups in its chains, mainly branched, remarkably increases viscosity inside the hydrated layer.3. The use of bioerodible matrices, which are capable of being degraded by the enzymes of some biological compartment. All the procedures listed above suffer, however, from drawbacks and imperfections. Inert matrices, for example, generally entail non-linear, but exponential, release of the active ingredient. Hydrophilic matrices: have a linear behaviour until a certain fraction of active ingredient has been released, then significantly deviate from linear release. Bioerodible matrices are ideal to carry out the so-called “sire-release”, but they involve the problem of finding the suitable enzyme or reactive to degradation. Furthermore, they frequently release in situ metabolites that are not wholly toxicologically inert. A number of formulations based on inert lipophilic matrices have been described: Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm. 13 (6), 1001-1022, (1987) discloses a process making use of varying amounts of colloidal silica as a porization element for a lipophilic inert matrix in which the active ingredient is incorporated. The same notion of canalization of an inert matrix is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,248 in which a small amount of a hydrophilic polymer is mixed with the substances forming an inert matrix, in a non sequential compenetration of different matrix materials. EP 375,063 discloses a technique for the preparation of multiparticulate granules for the controlled-release of the active ingredient which comprises co-dissolution of polymers or suitable substances to form a inert matrix with the active ingredient and the subsequent deposition of said solution on an inert carrier which acts as the core of the device. Alternatively, the inert carrier is kneaded with the solution containing the inert polymer and the active ingredient, then the organic solvent used for the dissolution is evaporated off to obtain a solid residue. The resulting structure is a “reservoir”, i.e. is not macroscopically homogeneous along all the symmetry axis of the final form. The same “reservoir” structure is also described in Chem. Pharm. Bull. 46 (3), 531-533, (1998) which improves the application through an annealing technique of the inert polymer layer which is deposited on the surface of the pellets. To the “reservoir” structure also belong the products obtained according to the technique described in WO 93/00889 which discloses a process for the preparation of pellets in hydrophilic matrix which comprises:—dissolution of the active ingredient with gastro resistant hydrophilic polymers in organic solvents;—drying of said suspension;—subsequent kneading and formulation of the pellets in a hydrophilic or lipophilic matrix without distinction of effectiveness between the two types of application. EP 0 453 001 discloses a multiparticulate with “reservoir” structure inserted in a hydrophilic matrix. The basic multiparticulate utilizes two coating membranes to decrease the release rate of the active ingredient, a pH-dependent membrane with the purpose of gastric protection and a pH-independent methacrylic membrane with the purpose of slowing down the penetration of the aqueous fluid. WO 95/16451 discloses a composition only formed by a hydrophilic matrix coated with a gastro-resistant film for controlling the dissolution rate of the active ingredient. When preparing sustained-, controlled-release dosage forms of a medicament topically active in the gastrointestinal tract, it is important to ensure a controlled release from the first phases following administration, i.e. when the inert matrices have the maximum release rate inside the logarithmic phase, namely the higher deviation from linear release. Said object has been attained according to the present invention, through the combination of an amphiphilic matrix inside an inert matrix, the latter formulated with a lipophilic polymer in a superficial hydrophilic matrix. The compositions of the invention are characterized by the absence of a first phase in which the medicament superficially present on the matrix is quickly solubilized, and by the fact the amphiphilic layer compensate the lack of affinity of the aqueous solvent with the lipophilic compounds forming the inner inert matrix. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The invention provides controlled release, delayed release, prolonged release, extended release and/or taste masking oral pharmaceutical compositions containing as active ingredient budesonide comprising: a) a matrix consisting of lipophilic compounds with melting point lower than 90° C. and optionally by amphiphilic compounds in which the active ingredient is at least partially incorporated;b) an amphiphilic matrix;c) an outer hydrophilic matrix in which the lipophilic matrix and the amphiphilic matrix are dispersed;d) optionally other excipients. A particular aspect of the invention consists of controlled release, delayed release, prolonged release, extended release and/or taste masking oral compositions containing as active ingredient budesonide comprising: a) a matrix consisting of amphiphilic compounds and lipophilic compounds with melting point below 90° C. in which the active ingredient is at least partially incorporated;b) an outer hydrophilic matrix in which the lipophilic/amphiphilic matrix is dispersed, preferably by mixing;c) optionally other excipients. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the active ingredient budesonide is contained in the composition in an amount from 1.5% to 15% w/w, based on the total weight of the composition. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, budesonide is comprised in an amount from 5 to 10 mgs/dose unit, more preferably in an amount of about 6 mgs/dose unit or 9 mgs/dose unit. A further aspect of the invention provides taste masking oral pharmaceutical compositions budesonide containing comprising: an inert or lipophilic matrix consisting of C6-C20 alcohols or C8-C20 fatty acids or esters of fatty acids with glycerol or sorbitol or other polyalcohols with carbon atom chain not higher than six;an amphiphilic matrix consisting of polar lipids of type I or II or glycols partially etherified with C1-C4 alkyl chains;an outer hydrophilic matrix containing the above matrices, mainly formed by saccharide, dextrin, polyalcohol or cellulose compounds or by hydrogels or their mixtures;optional excipients to give stability to the pharmaceutical formulation. DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The compositions of the invention can be prepared by a method comprising the following steps: a) the active ingredient, represented by budesonide, is first inglobated by simple kneading or mixing in a matrix or coating consisting of compounds having amphiphilic properties, which will be further specified below. The active ingredient can be mixed with the amphiphilic compounds without the aid of solvents or with small amounts of water-alcoholic solvents.b) the matrix obtained as specified under a) is incorporated in a low melting lipophilic excipient or mixture of excipients, if necessary while heating to soften and/or melt the excipient itself, which thereby incorporates the active ingredient by simple dispersion, forming an inert matrix which can be reduced in size to obtain inert matrix granules containing the active ingredient particles.c) the inert matrix granules are subsequently mixed together with one or more hydrophilic water-swellable excipients. The mixture is then subjected to compression or tableting. This way, when the tablet is contacted with biological fluids, a high viscosity swollen layer is formed, which coordinates the solvent molecules and acts as a barrier to penetration of the aqueous fluid itself inside the new structure. Said barrier antagonizes the starting “burst effect” caused by the dissolution of the medicament inglobated inside the inert matrix, which is in its turn inside the hydrophilic matrix. The amphiphilic compounds which can be used according to the invention comprise polar lipids of type I or II (lecithin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine), ceramides, glycol alkyl ethers such as diethylene glycol monomethyl ether (Transcutol®). The lipophilic matrix consists of substances selected from unsaturated or hydrogenated alcohols or fatty acids, salts, esters or amides thereof, fatty acids mono-, di- or triglycerides, the polyethoxylated derivatives thereof, waxes, ceramides, cholesterol derivatives or mixtures thereof having melting point within the range of 40° to 90° C., preferably from 60° to 70° C. If desired, a fatty acid calcium salt may be incorporated in the lipophilic matrix which is subsequently dispersed in a hydrophilic matrix prepared with alginic acid, thus remarkably increasing the hydrophilic matrix viscosity following penetration of the solvent front until contact with the lipophilic matrix granules dispersed inside. An amphiphilic matrix with high content in active ingredient, typically from 5% to 95% w/w, in particular from 20% to 70%, or from 1.5% to 15% w/w, is first prepared by dispersing the active ingredient in a mixture of amphiphilic compounds, such as lecithin, other type II polar lipids, surfactants, or in diethylene glycol monoethyl ether; the resulting amphiphilic matrix is then mixed or kneaded, usually while hot, with lipophilic compounds suitable to form an inert matrix, such as saturated or unsaturated fatty acids, such as palmitic, stearic, myristic, lauric, laurylic, or oleic acids or mixtures thereof with other fatty acids with shorter chain, or salts or alcohols or derivatives of the cited fatty acids, such as mono-, di-, or triglycerides or esters with polyethylene glycols, alone or in combination with waxes, ceramides, cholesterol derivatives or other apolar lipids in various ratios so that the melting or softening points of the lipophilic compounds mixtures is within the range of 40° to 90° C., preferably from 60° to 70° C. Alternatively, the order of formation of the inert and amphiphilic matrices can be reversed, incorporating the inert matrix inside the amphiphilic compounds. The resulting inert lipophilic matrix is reduced into granules by an extrusion and/or granulation process, or any other known processes which retain the homogeneous dispersion and matrix structure of the starting mixture. The hydrophilic matrix consists of excipients known as hydrogels, i.e. substances which when passing from the dry state to the hydrated one, undergo the so-called “molecular relaxation”, namely a remarkable increase in mass and weight following the coordination of a large number of water molecules by the polar groups present in the polymeric chains of the excipients themselves. Examples of hydrogels which can be used according to the invention are compounds selected from acrylic or methacrylic acid polymers or copolymers, alkylvinyl polymers, hydroxyalkyl celluloses, carboxyalkyl celluloses, polysaccharides, dextrins, pectins, starches and derivatives, natural or synthetic gums, alginic acid. In case of taste-masking formulations, the use of polyalcohols such as xylitol, maltitol and mannitol as hydrophilic compounds can also be advantageous. The lipophilic matrix granules containing the active ingredient are mixed with the hydrophilic compounds cited above in a weight ratio typically ranging from 100:0.5 to 100:50 (lipophilic matrix:hydrophilic matrix). Part of the active ingredient can optionally be mixed with hydrophilic substances to provide compositions in which the active ingredient is dispersed both in the lipophilic and the hydrophilic matrix, said compositions being preferably in the form of tablets, capsules and/or minitablets. The compression of the mixture of lipophilic and/or amphiphilic matrix, hydrogel-forming compound and, optionally, active ingredient not inglobated in the lipophilic matrix, yields a macroscopically homogeneous structure in all its volume, namely a matrix containing a dispersion of the lipophilic granules in a hydrophilic matrix. A similar result can also be obtained by coating the lipophilic matrix granules with a hydrophilic polymer coating. The tablets obtainable according to the invention can optionally be subjected to known coating processes with a gastro-resistant film/gastro-resistant coating, consisting of, for example, acrylic and/or methacrylic acids polymers (Eudragit®) or copolymers (Eudragit S/L) or cellulose derivatives, such as cellulose acetophthalate/s. According to a preferred embodiment of invention the gastro-protective coating can be represented by a mixture of acrylic and/or methacrylic acid copolymers type A and/or type B (as, for example, Eudragit S100 and/or Eudragit L100). According to a further embodiment of the invention, the mixture of acrylic and/or methacrylic acid copolymers type A and/or type B is preferably in a range ratio from 1:5 to 5:1. According to another further embodiment, the gastro-protective coating also optionally comprises plasticizers, dyes, at least one water-solvent, at least one organic solvent or a mixture thereof. The composition of the invention can further contain conventional excipients, for example bioadhesive excipients such as chitosans, polyacrylamides, natural or synthetic gums, acrylic acid polymers. The compositions of the invention are preferably in the form of tablets, capsules or minitablets. In terms of dissolution characteristics, contact with water or aqueous fluids causes the immediate penetration of water inside the more superficial layer of the matrix which, thanks to the presence of the aqueous solvent, swells due to the distension of the polymeric chains of the hydrogels, giving rise to a high viscosity hydrated front which prevents the further penetration of the solvent itself linearly slowing down the dissolution process to a well determined point which can be located at about half the thickness, until the further penetration of water would cause the disintegration of the hydrophilic layer and therefore the release of the content which, consisting of inert matrix granules, however induces the diffusion mechanism typical of these structures and therefore further slows down the dissolution profile of the active ingredient. The presence of the amphiphilic matrix inside the lipophilic matrix inert allows to prevent any unevenness of the release profile of the active ingredient. The surfactants present in the amphiphilic portion promote wettability of the porous canaliculuses which cross the inert matrix preventing or reducing resistance to penetration of the solvent inside the inert matrix. To obtain taste masking tablets, the components of the hydrophilic matrix are carefully selected to minimize the active substance release time through penetration accelerated by the canalization induced by the hydrophilic compound. The compositions of the present invention are preferably intended for use in the treatment of subjects suffering from Inflammatory Bowel Disease and/or Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Preferably, according to the invention Inflammatory Bowel Disease is Crohn's disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome is Ulcerative Colitis. Further object of the invention is then a method for the treatment of a subject suffering from Inflammatory Bowel Disease and/or Irritable Bowel Syndrome comprising administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of budesonide, as above defined and disclosed, to a subject in need of such treatment. Preferably, according to the invention Inflammatory Bowel Disease is Crohn's disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome is Ulcerative Colitis. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the budesonide composition release is: below 15% within the first hour at pH 7.2,greater than 80% within eight hours at pH 7.2. According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention the budesonide composition release is: below 15% within the first hour at pH 7.2,below 25% within two hours at pH 7.2;between 25% and 55% within four hours at pH 7.2;greater than 80% within eight hours at pH 7.2. According to a further preferred embodiment of the invention the budesonide composition release is: below 15% with the first hour at pH 7.2,between 20% and 60% within four hours at pH 7.2;greater than 80% at eight hour at pH 7.2. Experimental Part To test the effective ability of the formulations of the invention to modify the release rate and extent of the active ingredient from the dosage form suitable for the drug administration, before any pharmacokinetic study on patients or volunteers, the dissolution test is taken as monitoring and discriminating tool (according to USP type II apparatus complying with USP <711>). Also the bioavailability profile of the formulations of the invention is carried out, in comparison with a marketed formulation Entocort® EC 3×3 mg capsules. As preferred embodiment, the bioavailability study showed a Tmax average value higher than 8 hours and a MRT average value higher than 14 hours. According to the invention, Tmax corresponds to “time to peak concentration”, i.e., time to reach the peak plasma concentration of a drug after oral administration (Cmax) and MRT corresponds to “mean residence time”, i.e., the average total time molecules of a given dose spend in the body. This can only be measured after instantaneous administration. Other pharmacokinetics parameters useful according to the invention are represented by: AUC, which corresponds to “area under the curve”, i.e., the integral of the concentration-time curve (after a single dose or in steady state). In particular, AUC0-t is the area under the curve up to the last point and AUC0-∞ a, is the area under the curve up to infinite. Cmax, which corresponds to “peak concentration”, i.e., the peak plasma concentration of a drug after oral administration. t1/2, which corresponds to “biological half-time”, i.e., the time required for the concentration of the drug to reach half of its original value. Xu0-36h (ng), which corresponds to “urinary excretion”, i.e., the active ingredient metabolite urinary excretion during 36 hours time. Tlag, which corresponds to lag time, i.e., the time from administration of a drug to first quantifiable concentration. CI, which corresponds to “confidence intervals”, i.e., a particular kind of interval estimate of a population parameter used to indicate the reliability of an estimate. CV, which corresponds to “coefficient of variation” provides a relative measure of data dispersion with reference to the mean. Dissolution Test Method Tablets according to the present invention undergo to dissolution test to verify the formulation capacity in modulating and controlling the rate by which the active ingredient is leaked by the device or dosage form in the environmental medium, generally a buffered solution simulating gastric or intestinal juices. The dissolution test is performed by introducing individual tablets in a glace vessel containing from 500 to 1000 ml of a buffered solution set to different pH conditions (pH 1, 6.4 and 7.2 are the pH condition generally used in this test applications), so that the whole digestive tract pH conditions, from stomach to large intestine, should be reproduced. To simulate the human body conditions, the test is carried out at a temperature of 37° C.±2° C. and at predetermined time periods samples of the dissolution medium are withdrawn to detect the percentage of active ingredient dissolved over time. The tablets according to the present invention, when designed to be used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, in principle have to show a good resistance, thanks to the polymeric film resistant to the low pH conditions (intended as <5 to simulate the gastric environment) applied to cover the tablet surface, resistance which last at least for two hours; to target the large intestinal sectors, also the pH condition of 6.4 shown unsuitability to determine a drug leakage from the administration device for a short exposition time and only mediums at pH 7.2 have been able to determine an active ingredient dissolution at a progressive and quite constant rate during a timeframe from 6 to 12 hours; the dissolution percentage obtained with this tablet formulation were below 15% at first hour sampling, below 25% at second hour sampling, then values were in the range 25% to 55% at fourth hour and a dissolution greater than 80% was achieved at 8th hour sampling. Bioavailability Study Bioavailability profile of budesonide extended release compositions (6 mg and 9 mg tablets) vs. controlled ileal release formulation (Entocort® 3×3 mg capsules) in healthy volunteers is carried out. The objectives of the study are to compare the bioavailability and PK profile of a 9 mg budesonide extended release tablet formulation of the invention (herein after referred to as T1) versus the market reference formulation, Entocort® EC 3×3 mg capsules (Astra-Zeneca) (herein after referred to as R) and versus a 6 mg budesonide formulation of the invention (herein after referred to as T2). The primary end-point is comparing bioavailability rate through the PK parameters of plasma budesonide Cmax and Tmax after T1 formulation versus reference formulation. The secondary end-point is comparing bioavailability extent through plasma budesonide AUC0-t after T1 formulation versus reference formulation; comparing bioavailability extent through the PK parameters of plasma budesonide AUC0-t after T1 formulation versus T2 formulation; descriptive pharmacokinetics of budesonide; evaluation of main budesonide metabolite excretion in urine and safety of the test and reference formulations. Budesonide MMX™ extended release tablets 9 mgs (T1) and 6 mgs (T2) were orally administered in a single dose under fasting conditions in different study periods with a wash-out interval of at least 5 days. One tablet of T1 (batch MV084) or T2 (batch TV158) was administered together with 240 mL of mineral water; the subjects were instructed to swallow the whole tablet without chewing. The reference therapy was Entocort® EC 3×3 mg capsules (MP0077; Astra-Zeneca, Sweden), orally administered in a single dose under fasting conditions together with 240 mL of mineral water; the subjects were instructed to swallow the whole tablet without chewing. Results: After administration under fasting conditions in 3 consecutive study periods of a single dose of budesonide MMX™ extended release tablets 9 mg (T1), 6 mg (T2) of the invention and Entocort EC 3×3 mg capsules (R) the PK of budesonide was found significantly different.

administration under fasting conditions in 3 consecutive study periods of a single dose of Budesonide MMX™ extended release tablets 9 mg (T1), 6 mg (T2) and Entocort® EC 3×3 mg capsules (R) the PK of budesonide was found significantly different. Mean±SD (CV %) of plasma budesonide and urine budesonide-metabolite PK parameters are summarised in the table below for the PP population (N=12). Results obtained in the present study on the PP population (see table above) were confirmed by the results of the PK analysis on the PP-control population (i.e. after excluding subject randomisation Nr. 02, who showed pre-dose detectable levels) and therefore were regarded as the primary results of the study, as per protocol. Inter-subject variability was higher for the MMX™ tablet formulation than for Entocort® EC, a finding that can be explained by the broader intestinal tract involved in the drug release from the test products (whole colon and sigmoid) as compared to the reference (terminal ileum, ascending colon) and from the absence of dose fractionation in the MMX™ formulations. Although budesonide elimination is constant and no differences among formulations were found for t1/2 values, the different release/absorption behaviour of MMX™ tablets and Entocort® EC capsules was apparent from MRT values which were higher for the MMX™ formulations. Analysis on T1 and R Cmax and Tmax, showed a different rate of absorption for MMX™ tablets 9 mg (T1) with respect to Entocort® EC 3×3 mg capsules (R). T1 had a lower budesonide concentration peak than R as confirmed by a PE % of 79% and 90% CI limits of 63%-100%, and a significantly higher Tmax (13.3 h for T1 vs. 4.8 h for R). Extent of absorption calculated from the AUC0-t of budesonide after administration of T1 and R was also significantly different. T1 bioavailability over the 36 h period was lower than R bioavailability (PE=91%; 90% CI limits: 77%-108%). Therefore, T1 and R were found to be non-bioequivalent. Analysis on Tmax, and dose-normalized Cmax/dose and AUC0-t/dose showed differences in rate and extent of absorption also for T1 vs. T2, As expected, T1 had a higher concentration peak and bioavailability than T2, although a linear relationship with dose was not observed (PE for Cmax/dose=75%; 90% CI limits: 59%-95%, PE for AUC0-t/dose=80%; 90% CI limits: 67%-94%). Therefore, T1 and T2 were found non-bioequivalent. Tmax differences between T1 and T2 were not statistically significant (p value from t test=0.2244). Analysis on budesonide metabolite urinary excretion (Xu0-36h), showed a different excretion among formulations, with a bioequivalence not satisfied for T1 vs. R (PE=66%; 90% CI limits: 54%-81%) and almost achieved for T1 vs. T2 (PE=96%, 90% CI limits: 79%-117%). Safety Results: The safety profile of the 3 formulations was similar. Only 3 AEs occurred during the study, 1 with T2 formulation and 2 with R formulation. Of these 3 AEs, only 1 with R formulation (i.e. headache) was judged possibly related to treatment. No meaningful effect of treatment on vital signs, ECGs or laboratory parameters was observed. Conclusions: The formulation Budesonide MMX™ extended release tablets 9 mg was found not bioequivalent to the reference Entocort® EC 3×3 mg capsules in terms of rate and extent of bioavailability since the 90% CI for Cmax and AUC0-t did not fall within the 80%-125% limits required by current guidelines, and Tmax, was statistically different between MMX™ 9 mg and Entocort® EC 3.times.3 mg. This finding is explained by the different release behavior of the test and reference formulations which determines different profiles of budesonide absorption. When MMX™ 9 mg and 6 mg tablet formulations were compared to evaluate dose proportionality, whereas no significant difference was found for Tmax, the analysis of dose normalized Cmax, AUC0-t indicated lack of equivalence since the 90% CI for these parameters did not fall within the 80%-125% limits required by current guidelines. but overlapped them. The safety profile of the 3 formulations was similar and very good. Pharmaco-Scintigraphic and Kinetic Study A single dose, pharmaco-scintigraphic and kinetic study of the gastrointestinal transit and release of a 152Sm-labelled controlled release formulation of budesonide in 12 fasting male healthy volunteers is carried out. The objective of the study is to demonstrate and quantify, by pharmaco-scintigraphy and PK analysis, the release and absorption of budesonide in the target region. Each subject received 1 tablet of budesonide MMX™ 9 mg and an average radioactivity dose of 1.118+0.428 MBq as 153Sm2O3 To define the GI transit behavior of the study formulation, images were recorded at approximately 20 min intervals up to 3 h post-dose and 30 min intervals up to 10 h. Further acquisitions were taken at 12 and 24 h post-dose. The following Regions of Interest (ROIs) were defined: stomach, small intestine, terminal ileum, ileo-caecal junction and caecum, ascending, transverse, descending and sigmoid colon. Quantification of the distribution were achieved by measuring the count rates recorded from the ROIs. Budesonide plasma levels were detected between the 1st and the 12th h post-administration. On the average the appearance of drug plasma levels occurred in 6.79±3.24 h (Tlag). Peak time (Tmax) averaged 14.00±7.73 h, with mean concentration (Cmax) of 1768.7±1499.8 pg/mL. Measured average plasma AUCt in 24 h was 15607±14549 pgxh/mL. The difference Tmax-Tlag accounted for 7.21±5.49 h, a time period which may be representative of the release time of the active from the tablet. The following Table 5 summarizes the main kinetic evidence: TABLE 5 Cmax Tmax AUCt Tlag Tmax − N = 12 (pg/mL) (h) (pg × h/mL) (h) Tlag (h) Mean 1768.7 14.00 15607 6.79 7.21 SD 1499.8 7.734 14549 3.24 5.49 CV 84.80 55.24 93.22 47.66 76.13 Min 337.3 5 2465 1 0 Max 4756.3 24 53163 12 17 Combining the scintigraphic with the kinetic evidence, drug absorption during the time interval of the radioactivity location in the target ROI (i.e. the region comprised between the ascending and the descending-sigmoid colon) could be approximately calculated to amount to 95.88%±4.19% of the systemically bioavailable dose. Results: The systemic availability of budesonide MMX™ 9 mg is mostly ascribable to the drug absorption throughout the whole colon including the sigmoid, see Table 6 below: TABLE 6 AUCcolon/ AUCcolon AUCt AUCt × 100 Mean 15113.46 15606.52 95.88 SD 14401.79 14549.23 4.19 Min 2464.80 2464.80 84.93 Max 52376.20 53162.50 100.00 EXAMPLE 1 2.7 kg of budesonide, 3.0 kg of lecithin (amphiphilic matrix forming material) and 3.0 kg of stearic acid (lipophilic matrix forming material) are mixing after sieving till an homogeneous mixture is obtained; then add 39.0 kg of inert, functional excipients and 9.0 kg of low viscosity hydroxypropylcellulose (binder) and mix for 10 minutes before adding purified water and kneading to a suitable consistence. Then pass the granulate through a rotating granulator equipped with the suitable screen and transfer the granulate to the fluid bed drier to lower the residual moisture content under 3%. After a new sieving on the dry, the granulate is added of 9.0 kg of hydroxypropylcellulose (hydrophilic matrix forming material) and the suitable amount of functional excipients (in particular, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose and silicon dioxide) and, after 15 minutes of mixing, magnesium stearate in a suitable quantity to act as lubricant is added.
