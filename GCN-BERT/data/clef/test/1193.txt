CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims priority from PCT Application Ser. No. PCT/US2011/065330 filed on Dec. 16, 2011, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/425,274 filed on Dec. 21, 2010. FIELD OF INVENTION The invention provides a lubricating composition containing an oil of lubricating viscosity and a detergent. The invention further relates to a process to prepare the detergent and the use of the lubricating composition in a mechanical device such as an internal combustion engine or a driveline device. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is well known for lubricating oils to contain a number of surface active additives (including antiwear agents, dispersants, or detergents) used to protect internal combustion engines from corrosion, wear, soot deposits and acid build up. Often, such surface active additives can have harmful effects on mechanical devices (such as internal combustion engines or driveline devices). Harmful effects may include possible wear (in both iron and aluminium based components), bearing corrosion, increased acid accumulation (due to lack of neutralisation of combustion by-products), or reduction in fuel economy. A common antiwear additive for engine lubricating oils is zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP). It is believed that ZDDP antiwear additives protect the engine by forming a protective film on metal surfaces. ZDDP may also have a detrimental impact on fuel economy and efficiency and copper corrosion. Consequently, engine lubricants may also contain a friction modifier to obviate the detrimental impact of ZDDP on fuel economy and corrosion inhibitors to obviate the detrimental impact of ZDDP on copper corrosion. Other additives may also increase lead corrosion. Other art known to a skilled person includes a number of publications disclosing esters or amides or imides of carboxylic acids, or esters or amides or imides of hydroxycarboxylic acid as possible antiwear agents. The publications include Canadian Patent CA 1 183 125; East German Patent DD 299533 A5; International Publications WO 2006/044411, WO 2005/087904, WO2008/070307; Japanese Patent Applications 2005139238 A, 10183161A, 10130679A, and 05117680A; US Patent Applications 2010/0190669, 2010/0197536, and 2010/0093573, 20050198894; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,237,022, 5,338,470, 4,436,640, 4,157,970, 4,863,622, 5,132,034, 5,215,549, and 6,127,327. Detergents such as metal sulphonates, metal phenates, metal salicylates, and metal salixarates are known. The detergents may be prepared in the presence or absence of a carboxylic acid. For example carboxylic acid-modified detergents are disclosed in EP 271 262 A, EP 273 588 A, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,792,735 and 5,674,821. Typical acids disclosed therein may be defined by the formula RCH(R1)CO2H, wherein R is a C10 to C24 alkyl group and R1 is hydrogen or a C1 to C4 alkyl group. An exemplified acid-modified detergent includes a hydrocarbyl-substituted phenate that contains 12 to 20 by weight of stearic acid. U.S. Pat. No. 3,155,617 discloses a means of activating calcium oxide (prepared from roasting calcium carbonate), so that it is useful in the methanol process for preparing dispersions of calcium carbonate. The calcium oxide is treated in methanol suspension with a small amount of an acid such as acetic acid. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The objectives of the present invention include to provide at least one of antiwear performance, friction modification (particularly for enhancing fuel economy), or detergent performance. As used herein reference to the amounts of additives present in the lubricating composition disclosed herein are quoted on an oil free basis, i.e., amount of actives, unless otherwise indicated. In one embodiment the present invention provides a process to prepare a detergent comprising: (a) reacting in the presence of a solvent (typically an oil medium, or a hydrocarbon solvent such as an alkane (typically hexane), or toluene), a mixture of (i) an acidic detergent substrate, and(ii) a basic metal compound, and optionally further in the presence of an alcohol; (b) optionally reacting the product of (a) with carbon dioxide to form an overbased detergent; and (c) optionally, removing volatiles (typically solvent, water or alcohol) from the product of (a) or (b), wherein a hydroxycarboxylic acid, or reactive equivalent thereof is added to at least one of any required step selected from the group consisting of (a), (b), (c), and mixtures thereof of step (a) to (c). As used herein the expression “added to at least one of any required step” is intended to mean that the hydroxycarboxylic acid, or reactive equivalent thereof, is added to any of the steps that are actually performed in the practice of this invention. For example, if steps (a) and (b) are performed then the hydroxycarboxylic acid, or reactive equivalent thereof, may be added at either step (a) or step (b), or even in both steps (a) and (b). Likewise if steps (a) and (c) are performed. Likewise if steps (a), (b) and (c) are performed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a detergent, a process to prepare a detergent, a lubricating composition, a method for lubricating a mechanical device and a use as disclosed above. Basic Metal Compound The metal basic compound is used to supply basicity to the detergent. The basic metal compound is a compound of a hydroxide or oxide of the metal. Within the metal compound, the metal is typically in the form of an ion. The metal may be monovalent, divalent, or trivalent. When monovalent, the metal ion M may be an alkali metal, when divalent, the metal ion M may be an alkaline earth metal, and when trivalent the metal ion M may be aluminium. The alkali metal may include lithium, sodium, or potassium, or mixtures thereof, typically sodium. The alkaline earth metal may include magnesium, calcium, barium or mixtures thereof, typically calcium or magnesium. Examples of metal basic compounds with hydroxide functionality include lithium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, barium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide. Suitable examples of metal basic compounds with oxide functionality include lithium oxide, magnesium oxide, calcium oxide and barium oxide. The oxides and/or hydroxides can be used alone or in combination. The oxides or hydroxides may be hydrated or dehydrated, although hydrated is typical (for calcium, at least). In one embodiment the metal basic compound may be calcium hydroxide, which may be used alone or mixtures thereof with other metal basic compounds. Calcium hydroxide is often referred to as lime. In one embodiment the metal basic compound may be calcium oxide which can be used alone or mixtures thereof with other metal basic compounds. Acidic Detergent Substrate In different embodiments the process of the invention forms a neutral detergent, or an overbased detergent. In one embodiment the process described herein provides a product that may be described as “overbased”. The expression “overbased” is known to a person skilled in the art. Overbased materials, otherwise referred to as overbased or superbased salts, are generally single phase, homogeneous Newtonian systems characterised by a metal content in excess of that which would be present for neutralisation according to the stoichiometry of the metal and the particular acidic organic compound reacted with the metal. The amount of metal is commonly expressed in terms of substrate to metal ratio. The terminology “metal ratio” is used in the prior art and herein to designate the ratio of the total chemical equivalents of the metal in the overbased salt to the chemical equivalents of the metal in the salt which would be expected to result in the reaction between the hydrocarbyl-substituted organic acid; the hydrocarbyl-substituted phenol or mixtures thereof to be overbased and the basically reacting metal compound according to the known chemical reactivity and stoichiometry of the two reactants. Thus, in a normal or neutral salt the metal ratio is one and, in an overbased salt, the metal ratio is greater than one. The overbased metal salt of the hydrocarbyl-substituted organic acid; the hydrocarbyl-substituted phenol or mixtures thereof used in this invention usually have metal ratios not exceeding 40:1 (or 40). Often, salts having ratios of 2:1 to 35:1 are used. Such overbased materials are well known to those skilled in the art. Patents describing techniques for making basic salts of sulphonic acids, carboxylic acids, phenols, and mixtures of any two or more of these include U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,501,731; 2,616,905; 2,616,911; 2,616,925; 2,777,874; 3,256,186; 3,384,585; 3,365,396; 3,320,162; 3,318,809; 3,488,284; and 3,629,109. A more detailed description of the expressions “metal ratio”, TBN and “soap content” are known to a person skilled in the art and explained in standard textbook entitled “Chemistry and Technology of Lubricants”, Third Edition, Edited by R. M. Mortier and S. T. Orszulik, Copyright 2010, pages 219 to 220 under the sub-heading 7.2.5. Detergent Classification. The detergent may be formed by the reaction of the basic metal compound, and an acidic detergent substrate. The acidic detergent substrate may include an alkyl phenol, an aldehyde-coupled alkyl phenol, a sulphurised alkyl phenol, an alkyl aromatic sulphonic acid (such as, alkyl naphthalene sulphonic acid, alkyl toluene sulphonic acid or alkyl benzene sulphonic acid), an aliphatic carboxylic acid, a calixarene, a salixarene, an alkyl salicylic acid, or mixtures thereof. Collectively, when the alkyl phenol, the aldehyde-coupled alkyl phenol, and the sulphurised alkyl phenol are used to prepare a detergent, the detergent may be referred to as a phenate. As used herein the TBN values quoted and associated range of TBN is on “an as is basis” i.e., containing conventional amounts of diluent oil which is used to handle viscosity. Conventional amounts of diluent oil typically range from 30 wt % to 60 wt % (often 40 wt % to 55 wt %) of the detergent component. The TBN of a phenate may vary from less 200, or 30 to 175 (typically 155 mg KOH/g for a neutral phenate to 200 or more to 500, or 210 to 400 (typically 250-255) mg KOH/g for an overbased phenate. The alkyl group of a phenate (i.e., an alkyl phenate) may contain 4 to 80, or 6 to 45, or 8 to 20, or 9 to 15 carbon atoms. In one embodiment the acidic or neutralised detergent substrate comprises one or more of alkyl aromatic sulphonic acid, calixarene, salixarene, alkyl salicylic acid, carboxylate or mixtures thereof. When the detergent is formed, the common nomenclature for the neutral or overbased detergent is a salixarate (from calixarene or salixarene), a sulphonate (from aromatic sulphonic acid, typically a benzene sulphonic acid), a salicylate (from alkyl salicylic acid), or a phenate (from alkyl phenol, aldehyde-coupled alkyl phenol, sulphurised alkyl phenol), or a saligenin. In one embodiment the detergent may be a sulphonate, or mixtures thereof. The sulphonate may be prepared from a mono- or di-hydrocarbyl-substituted benzene (or naphthalene, indenyl, indanyl, or bicyclopentadienyl) sulphonic acid, wherein the hydrocarbyl group may contain 6 to 40, or 8 to 35 or 9 to 30 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbyl group may be derived from polypropylene or a linear or branched alkyl group containing at least 10 carbon atoms. Examples of a suitable alkyl group include branched and/or linear decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl, octadecenyl, nonodecyl, eicosyl, un-eicosyl, do-eicosyl, tri-eicosyl, tetra-eicosyl, penta-eicosyl, hexa-eicosyl or mixtures thereof. In one embodiment the hydrocarbyl-substituted sulphonic acid may include polypropene benzenesulphonic acid and C16-C24 alkyl benzenesulphonic acid, or mixtures thereof. When neutral or slightly basic, a sulphonate detergent may have TBN of less than 100, or less than 75, typically 20 to 50 mg KOH/g, or 0 to 20 mg KOH/g. When overbased, a sulphonate detergent may have a TBN greater than 200, or 300 to 550, or 350 to 450 mg KOH/g. A salicylate detergent may be derived from an alkyl-substituted salicylic acid. The TBN of a neutral salicylate may be 50 to 200, or 75 to 175 mg KOH/g. An overbased salicylate may have a TBN of greater than 200 to 400, or 225 to 350 mg KOH/g. The alkyl group of a salicylate may contain 4 to 80, or 6 to 45, or 8 to 20, or 9 to 18 carbon atoms. In different embodiments the alkyl group of a salicylate may contain 12 or 16 carbon atoms. Chemical structures for sulphonates, phenates and salicylates detergents are known to a person skilled in the art. The standard textbook entitled “Chemistry and Technology of Lubricants”, Third Edition, Edited by R. M. Mortier and S. T. Orszulik, Copyright 2010, pages 220 to 223 under the sub-heading 7.2.6 provide general disclosures of said detergents and their structures. A saligenin detergent is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,285,516 in column 3, line 47 to column 5, line 63. A salixarate detergent is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,285,516 in column 5, line 64 to column 7, line 53. In general terms a salixarate is derived from coupling a hydrocarbyl-substituted phenol with (an optionally hydrocarbyl-substituted) salicylic acid in the presence of formaldehyde. Salixarate derivatives and methods of their preparation are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,200,936 and PCT Publication WO 01/56968. It is believed that the salixarate derivatives have a predominantly linear, rather than macrocyclic, structure, although both structures are intended to be encompassed by the term “salixarate.” An overbased salixarate may have a TBN of 170 to 300 mg KOH/g. A neutral salixarate may have a TBN of 50 to less than 170 mg KOH/g. In one embodiment the detergent may be a carboxylate derived from an aliphatic carboxylic acid. The aliphatic acid may contain 6 to 30, or 7 to 16 carbon atoms. Examples of a suitable carboxylic acid include caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, myristoleic acid, decanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, 12-hydroxystearic acid, oleic acid, ricinoleic acid, linoleic acid, arachidic acid, gadoleic acid, eicosadienoic acid, behenic acid, erucic acid, tall oil fatty acids, rapeseed oil fatty acid, linseed oil fatty acid, or mixtures thereof. In one embodiment the aliphatic acids are oleic acid or tall oil fatty acid. The carboxylate may have a metal ratio of 0.2 to 10, or from 0.5 to 7, or from 0.7 to 5. When overbased, the metal ratio is greater than one. In one embodiment the acidic or neutralised detergent substrate comprises mixtures of at least two of said substrates. When two or more detergent substrates are used, the overbased detergent formed may be described as a complex/hybrid. Typically, the complex/hybrid may be prepared by reacting, in the presence of the basic metal compound and acidifying overbasing agent, alkyl aromatic sulphonic acid at least one alkyl phenol (such as, alkyl phenol, aldehyde-coupled alkyl phenol, sulphurised alkyl phenol) and optionally alkyl salicylic acid. An detergent substrate used to prepare a complex or hybrid may be prepared as is disclosed in WO97/46643 (also published as U.S. Pat. No. 6,429,179). The detergent substrate and the hydroxy-carboxylic acid are present as reactants with a mole ratio of the detergent substrate to the hydroxy-carboxylic acid in the range of 20:1 to 1:2, or 20:1 to 1:1, or 18:1 to 1:1. When the detergent substrate is a sulphonate, the mole ratio of the detergent substrate to the hydroxy-carboxylic acid may vary from 5:1 to 1:1, or 3:1 to 1:1. When the detergent substrate is a phenate, the mole ratio of the detergent substrate to the hydroxy-carboxylic acid may vary from 18:1 to 1:1, or 18:1 to 8:1. When the detergent substrate is a salicylate, the mole ratio of the detergent substrate to the hydroxy-carboxylic acid may vary from 10:1 to 1:1, or 8:1 to 5:1. When the detergent substrate is a salixarate, the mole ratio of the detergent substrate to the hydroxy-carboxylic acid may vary from 5:1 to 1:1, or 3:1 to 1:1. Hydroxycarboxylic Acid The hydroxy-carboxylic acid may typically be non-aromatic. The hydroxy-carboxylic acid may be represented by the formula: wherein n and m may be independently integers of 1 to 5;X may be an aliphatic or alicyclic group, or an aliphatic or alicyclic group containing an oxygen atom in the carbon chain, or a substituted group of the foregoing types, said group containing up to 6 carbon atoms and having n+m available points of attachment;each Y may be independently —O—, >NH, or >NR1 or two Ys together representing the nitrogen of an imide structure R—N<formed between two carbonyl groups; andeach R and R1 may be independently hydrogen or a hydrocarbyl group,each R2 may be independently hydrogen, a hydrocarbyl group or an acyl group, further provided that at least one —OR2 group is located on a carbon atom within X that is α or β to at least one of the —C(O)—Y—R groups, with the proviso that at least one of R and R2 is hydrogen (typically all R and R2s are hydrogen). The hydroxy-carboxylic acid may have 2 to 8, or 2 to 6, or 2 to 4, or 2 to 3 carboxylic acid groups. In one embodiment the hydroxy-carboxylic acid may have at least two carboxylic acid groups. The hydroxy-carboxylic acid may be tartaric acid, citric acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, or mixtures thereof. The hydroxy-carboxylic acid may be, for instance, tartaric acid (n and m both equal 2), citric acid (n=3, m=1), malic acid (n=2, m=1), glycolic acid (n and m both equal 1), or mixtures thereof.

Synthetic oils may also be produced by Fischer-Tropsch reactions and typically may be hydroisomerised Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbons or waxes. In one embodiment oils may be prepared by a Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquid synthetic procedure as well as other gas-to-liquid oils. Oils of lubricating viscosity may also be defined as specified in April 2008 version of “Appendix E—API Base Oil Interchangeability Guidelines for Passenger Car Motor Oils and Diesel Engine Oils”, section 1.3 Sub-heading 1.3. “Base Stock Categories”.

Overbased materials, otherwise referred to as overbased or superbased salts, are generally single phase, homogeneous Newtonian systems characterized by a metal content in of that which would be present for neutralization according to the stoichiometry of the metal and the particular acidic organic compound reacted with the metal. The overbased materials are prepared by reacting an acidic material (typically an inorganic acid or lower carboxylic acid, preferably carbon dioxide) with a mixture comprising an acidic organic compound, a reaction medium comprising at least one inert, organic solvent (mineral oil, naphtha, toluene, xylene, etc.) for said acidic organic material, a stoichiometric excess of a metal base, and a promoter such as a calcium chloride, acetic acid, phenol or alcohol. The acidic organic material will normally have a sufficient number of carbon atoms to provide a degree of solubility in oil. The amount of “excess” metal (stoichiometrically) is commonly expressed in terms of metal ratio. The term “metal ratio” is the ratio of the total equivalents of the metal to the equivalents of the acidic organic compound. A neutral metal salt has a metal ratio of one. A salt having 3.5 times as much metal as present in a normal salt will have metal excess of 3.5 equivalents, or a ratio of 4.5. The term “metal ratio is also explained in standard textbook entitled “Chemistry and Technology of Lubricants”, Third Edition, Edited by R. M. Mortier and S. T.

In one embodiment a useful mixture of amines is “Primene® 81R” and “Primene® JMT.” Primene® 81R and Primene® JMT (both produced and sold by Rohm & Haas, or Dow Chemicals) are mixtures of C11 to C14 tertiary alkyl primary amines and C18 to C22 tertiary alkyl primary amines respectively. In one embodiment oil soluble amine salts of phosphorus compounds include a sulphur-free amine salt of a phosphorus-containing compound may be obtained/obtainable by a process comprising: reacting an amine with either (i) a hydroxy-substituted di-ester of phosphoric acid, or (ii) a phosphorylated hydroxy-substituted di- or tri-ester of phosphoric acid. A more detailed description of compounds of this type is disclosed in International Application PCT/US08/051,126 (or equivalent to U.S. application Ser. No. 11/627,405). In one embodiment the hydrocarbyl amine salt of an alkylphosphoric acid ester is the reaction product of a C14 to C18 alkyl phosphoric acid with Primene 81R™ (produced and sold by Rohm & Haas, or Dow Chemicals) which is a mixture of C11 to C14 tertiary alkyl primary amines.

The mixture may be heated at 75° C. for 2.5 hours, mixed with a diatomaceous earth and filtered at 70° C. The filtrate contains 11.8% by weight phosphorus, 15.2% by weight sulphur, and an acid number of 87 (bromophenol blue). The dithiocarbamate-containing compounds may be prepared by reacting a dithiocarbamate acid or salt with an unsaturated compound. The dithiocarbamate containing compounds may also be prepared by simultaneously reacting an amine, carbon disulphide and an unsaturated compound. Generally, the reaction occurs at a temperature from 25° C. to 125° C.

The amounts quoted in the examples below include conventional amounts of diluent oil. Typically diluent oil is present in dispersants and detergents and may vary from 30 wt % to 60 wt % diluent oil. Internal Combustion Lubricant Evaluation Comparative Example 1 (CE1) is a 5W-30 engine oil lubricant containing 7.5 wt % of dispersant, 0.57 wt % of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate, 3.6 wt % of antioxidants (a mixture of phenolic, aminic antioxidants, and sulphurised olefin), 0.15 wt % of corrosion inhibitors, 0.29 wt % of a 80 TBN sulphonate detergent, and 1.80 wt % of 400 TBN sulphonate detergent. The balance is an API Group III base oil derived from a mixture of 4 mm2s−1 and 6 mm2s−1 oils. The lubricating composition has a sulphated ash content of 1 wt %, and a detergent soap content of 0.5 wt %. Example 1 (EX1) is similar to CE1, except it replaces the 400 TBN sulphonate detergent with 1.8 wt % of the product of Prep1. Comparative Example 2 (CE2) is similar to CE1, except it contains 1.53 wt % of 400 TBN sulphonate detergent and 1.19 wt % of a 80 TBN sulphonate detergent. The lubricating composition has a sulphated ash content of 1 wt %, and a detergent soap content of 1 wt %.

Example 3 (EX3) is similar to CE3, except it replaces the 400 TBN sulphonate detergent with 1.8 wt % of the product of Prep1. CE1 to CE3 and EX1 to EX3 are evaluated for antiwear performance using a programmed temperature high frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR) available from PCS Instruments. HFRR conditions for the evaluations are 500 g load, 75 minute duration, 1000 micrometer stroke, 20 Hertz frequency, and temperature profile of 15 minutes at 40° C. followed by an increase in temperature to 160° C. at a rate of 2° C. per minute. The wear scar data obtained is measured and presented in the following table: Example wt % Ash wt % Soap Wear Scar (μm) CE1 1 0.5 178 EX1 1 0.5 165 CE2 1 1 178 EX2 1 1 175 CE3 1 0.5 198 EX3 1 0.5 174 Driveline Lubricant Evaluation Comparative Example 4 (CE4) contains 0.25 wt % of 400 TBN calcium sulphonate detergent, 0.2 wt % of dibutyl phosphite, 0.5 wt % of aminic antioxidant, 2 wt % of a post-treated dispersant that has been reacted with terephthalic acid and boric acid, and base oil. The gear oil has a viscosity of 5.6 mm2/s. Comparative Example 5 (CE5) is similar to CE4, containing 1 wt % of 400 TBN calcium sulphonate detergent. Example 4 (EX4) is similar to CE5, except it replaces 1 wt % of 400 TBN calcium sulphonate detergent with 1 wt % of the product of Prep1. Example 5 (EX5) is similar to CE5, except it replaces 1 wt % of 400 TBN calcium sulphonate detergent with 1 wt % of the product of Prep2. CE4, CE5, EX4 and EX5 are evaluated for gear oil performance by FZG and VSFT test procedures. The FZG test measures the antiscuffing properties of oil for reduction gears, hypoid gears, automatic transmission gears and the like. A description of the FZG test and the meaning of the results is found in the article “Scuffing Tests on Gear Oils in the FZG Apparatus” by G. Niemann, H. Rettig and G. Lechner in ASLE Transactions, 4 71-86 (1961). Test procedure DIN 51354 is utilized which is discussed in Prufung von Schmierstoffen: Mechanische Prufung von Gebriebeolen in der FZG-Zahnrad—Verspannungs—Prufmaschine, January 1970. The FZG test ratings below are based on FZG A10/16.6R/90 test. The results reported include load stage failure. Typically better results are obtained for lubricants reporting a higher load stage failure. The VSFT test procedure consists of a disc that can be metal or another friction material which is rotated against a metal surface. The friction materials employed in the particular tests are various commercial friction materials commonly used in automatic transmission clutches, as indicated in the Tables. The test is run over three temperatures and two load levels. The coefficient of friction measured by the VSFT is plotted against the sliding speed (50 and 200 r.p.m.) over a number speed sweeps at a constant pressure. The results are initially presented as slope of the μ-v curve as a function of time, reported for 40, 80, and 120° C. and 24 kg and 40 kg (235 and 392 N) force, determined at 4 hour intervals from 0 to 52 hours. Typically, the slope will initially be positive, with a certain amount of variability, and may gradually decrease, possibly becoming negative after a certain period of time. Overall, the present invention may provide at least one of antiwear performance, friction modification (particularly for enhancing fuel economy), or detergent performance. It is known that some of the materials described above may interact in the final formulation, so that the components of the final formulation may be different from those that are initially added.

Each of the documents referred to above is incorporated herein by reference. Except in the Examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numerical quantities in this description specifying amounts of materials, reaction conditions, molecular weights, number of carbon atoms, and the like, are to be understood as modified by the word “about.” Unless otherwise indicated, each chemical or composition referred to herein should be interpreted as being a commercial grade material which may contain the isomers, by-products, derivatives, and other such materials which are normally understood to be present in the commercial grade. However, the amount of each chemical component is presented exclusive of any solvent or diluent oil, which may be customarily present in the commercial material, unless otherwise indicated. It is to be understood that the upper and lower amount, range, and ratio limits set forth herein may be independently combined. Similarly, the ranges and amounts for each element of the invention may be used together with ranges or amounts for any of the other elements. As used herein, the term “hydrocarbyl substituent” or “hydrocarbyl group” is used in its ordinary sense, which is well-known to those skilled in the art. Specifically, it refers to a group having a carbon atom directly attached to the remainder of the molecule and having predominantly hydrocarbon character. Examples of hydrocarbyl groups include: hydrocarbon substituents, including aliphatic, alicyclic, and aromatic substituents; substituted hydrocarbon substituents, that is, substituents containing non-hydrocarbon groups which, in the context of this invention, do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon nature of the substituent; and hetero substituents, that is, substituents which similarly have a predominantly hydrocarbon character but contain other than carbon in a ring or chain. A more detailed definition of the term “hydrocarbyl substituent” or “hydrocarbyl group” is described in paragraphs [0118] to [0119] of International Publication WO2008147704, or a similar definition in paragraphs to [0141] of published application US 2010-0197536.
