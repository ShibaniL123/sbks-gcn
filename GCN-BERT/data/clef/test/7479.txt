Example 16. Preparation of DPAG-1
A 50 mL flask was charged with 2-hydroxy-2-trifluoromethylacetophenone (SM-9, 0.60 g, 2.93 mmol, 2.0 eq.) and THF (7.5 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −30° C. n-BuLi (1.6 M, 1.8 mL, 2.93 mmol, 2.0 eq.) drop-wise to the mixture over 10 minutes and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at −30° C. This solution was added drop-wise to a cold (−30° C.) solution of 2,2'-(hexane-1,6-diylbis(azanediyl)bis(1,1-difluoro-2-oxoethane-1-sulfonyl fluoride) (SM-7, 0.64 g, 1.47 mmol, 1.0 eq.) in THF (7.5 mL) over 5 minutes and the mixture was stirred for 4 hours while warming from −30° C. to 10° C. 1N HCl (15 mL) was added to the final reaction mixture and then Et2O (45 mL) was added. The upper layer was separated and washed with 1N HCl (15 mL) and the lower layer was extracted with Et2O (30 mL). The organic layers were combined and washed with brine (15 mL) twice and was subsequently dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. Solvents were removed in an evaporator and CHCl3 (100 mL) was added to the crude material. An insoluble solid was filtrated off and the filtrate was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (5×15 mL). The lower layer was separated and concentrated in an evaporator. The target PAG was obtained as a colorless oil (0.09 g, 4.9% yield).
