Pentaerythritol (13.6 g, 100 mmol) was reacted with 4-toluenesulfonyl chloride (72.0 g, 0.4 mol) in dry pyridine (100 mL) for 16 h at room temperature. After the reaction was accomplished, 500 mL of ice-cold water was added while the mixture was stirred vigorously. The white precipitate that formed was filtered off and rinsed five times with water to remove pyridine. Drying of the product in a vacuum oven gave pure pentaerythrityl tosylate (PETS, 67.0 g, 89%) as a white solid.
