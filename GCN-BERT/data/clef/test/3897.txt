CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/526,096, filed Aug. 6, 2009, which is a U.S. national counterpart application of international application serial no. PCT/US2008/053293 filed Feb. 7, 2008, under 35 USC ยง371, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/899,921, filed Feb. 7, 2007, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/896,018, filed Mar. 21, 2007, under 35 USC ยง119(e), all of which are incorporated herein by this reference in their entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to compositions and methods to diagnose and/or monitor pathogenic disease states using positron emission tomography. In particular, this invention relates to pathogenic cells that uniquely express, preferentially express, or overexpress vitamin receptors. Vitamin receptor binding compounds conjugated to a radiophore useful in positron emission tomography are described for diagnosing and/or monitoring disease states using an extra-corporeal device. BACKGROUND Vitamin receptors are overexpressed on cancer cells. For example, the folate receptor, a 38 KD GPI-anchored protein that binds the vitamin folic acid with high affinity (<1 nM), is overexpressed on many malignant tissues, including ovarian, breast, bronchial, and brain cancers. In particular, it is estimated that 95% of all ovarian carcinomas overexpress the folate receptor. In contrast, with the exception of kidney, choroid plexus, and placenta, normal tissues express low or nondetectable levels of the folate receptor. Most cells also use an unrelated reduced folate carrier to acquire the necessary folic acid. Following receptor binding of vitamins such as folate to vitamin receptors, rapid endocytosis delivers the vitamin into the cell, where it is unloaded in an endosomal compartment at lower pH. Importantly, covalent conjugation of small molecules, proteins, and even liposomes to vitamins and other vitamin receptor binding ligands does not block the ability of the ligand to bind to its receptor, and therefore, such ligand conjugates can readily be delivered to and can enter cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. It has also been shown that activated monocytes overexpress the folate receptor. The overexpression of folate receptors on activated macrophages, and on activated monocytes, is described in U.S. Patent Application Nos. 60/696,740 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2002/0192157, each entirely incorporated herein by reference. Further, it has also been reported that the folate receptor ฮฒ, the nonepithelial isoform of the folate receptor, is expressed on activated, but not resting, synovial macrophages. Activated macrophages can participate in the immune response by nonspecifically engulfing and killing foreign pathogens within the macrophage, by displaying degraded peptides from foreign proteins on the macrophage cell surface where they can be recognized by other immune cells, and by secreting cytokines and other factors that modulate the function of T and B lymphocytes, resulting in further stimulation of immune responses. However, activated macrophages can also contribute to the pathophysiology of disease in some instances. For example, activated macrophages can contribute to atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disease states, and graft versus host disease, among other disease states. An example of the contribution of activated macrophages to disease states is the involvement of activated macrophages in the progression of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a disease state initiated when a fatty streak forms within a blood vessel wall. Formation of fatty streaks is believed to result from accumulation of lipoprotein particles in the intima layer of the blood vessel wall, the layer of the vessel wall underlying the luminal endothelial cell layer. Lipoprotein particles can associate with extracellular matrix components in the intima layer and can become inaccessible to plasma antioxidants, resulting in oxidative modification of the lipoprotein particles. Such oxidative modification may trigger a local inflammatory response resulting in adhesion of activated macrophages and T lymphocytes to the luminal endothelium followed by migration into the intima layer. The oxidized lipoprotein particles themselves can act as chemo-attractants for cells of the immune system, such as macrophages and T cells, or can induce cells in the vascular wall to produce chemo-attractants. The atherosclerotic lesion may then form a fibrous cap with a lipid-rich core filled with activated macrophages. Atherosclerotic lesions that are unstable are characterized by local inflammation, and lesions that have ruptured and have caused fatal myocardial infarction are characterized by an infiltration of activated macrophages and T lymphocytes. U.S. Pat. No. 6,782,289, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2005/0244336, and PCT International Publication No. WO 2004/110250, each entirely incorporated herein by reference, provide discussions of possible origins of blood vessel disease.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to compositions and methods to diagnose and/or monitor pathogenic disease states using positron emission tomography (PET), wherein the pathogenic cells uniquely express, preferentially express, or overexpress vitamin receptors or other receptors. The invention is applicable to populations of pathogenic cells that cause a variety of pathologies such as cancer, disease states that involve activated macrophages or activated monocytes, disease states that involve activated plaques, and the like. In the case of cancer, the population of pathogenic cells may be a cancer cell population that is tumorigenic, including benign tumors and malignant tumors, or it can be non-tumorigenic. The cancer cell population may arise spontaneously or by such processes as mutations present in the germline of the patient or somatic mutations, or it may be chemically, virally, or radiation induced. The invention can be utilized to diagnose and/or monitor such cancers as carcinomas, sarcomas, lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease, melanomas, mesotheliomas, Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinomas, leukemias, myelomas, and the like. The cancer cell population can include, but is not limited to, oral, thyroid, endocrine, skin, gastric, esophageal, laryngeal, pancreatic, colon, bladder, bone, ovarian, cervical, uterine, breast, testicular, prostate, rectal, kidney, liver, lung, and other cancers. The pathogenic cells can also be activated monocytes or macrophages associated with disease states such as fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, osteomyelitis, multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, systemic sclerosis, organ transplant rejection (GVHD), lupus erythematosus, Sjรถgren's syndrome, glomerulonephritis, inflammations of the skin, such as psoriasis, and the like, chronic inflammations, and inflammations due to injury, such as head or spinal cord injury, embolisms, and the like. In one embodiment, a method is described for diagnosing and/or monitoring a disease state mediated by activated macrophages or activated monocytes having accessible binding sites for a vitamin. The method comprises the steps of administering to a patient being evaluated for the disease state an effective amount of a conjugate of the general formula B-L-X, wherein B comprises a vitamin, or an analog or derivative thereof capable of binding to a vitamin receptor, the group X comprises a radiophore, and L is an optional linker. The method includes allowing sufficient time for the conjugate to bind to activated monocytes or the activated macrophages, and diagnosing and/or monitoring the disease state extra-corporeally using positron emission tomography. In one aspect, the radiophore has a half-life of about 80 minutes to about 8 hours. In another embodiment, a method is described for diagnosing and/or monitoring a cancer wherein the cancer cells uniquely express, preferentially express, or overexpress vitamin receptors. The method comprises the steps of administering to a patient being evaluated for the cancer an effective amount of a conjugate of the general formula B-L-X, wherein B comprises a vitamin, or an analog or derivative thereof capable of binding to a vitamin receptor, the group X comprises a radiophore, and L is an optional linker. In one aspect, the radiophore has a half-life of about 80 minutes to about 8 hours, and the method includes allowing sufficient time for the conjugate to bind to the cancer cells, and diagnosing and/or monitoring the cancer extra-corporeally using positron emission tomography. In another embodiment, a method is described for diagnosing/monitoring active atherosclerotic plaques associated with blood vessels wherein the plaques comprise activated macrophages having accessible binding sites for a vitamin. The method comprises the steps of administering to a patient being evaluated for atherosclerosis an effective amount of a conjugate of the general formula B-L-X, wherein B comprises a vitamin, or an analog or derivative thereof capable of binding to a vitamin receptor, the group X comprises a radiophore, and L is an optional linker. In one aspect, the radiophore is capable of decaying by emission of positrons, and the method includes allowing sufficient time for the vitamin conjugate to bind to the activated macrophages associated with active plaques, and diagnosing and/or monitoring the active plaques extra-corporeally using positron emission tomography. In another aspect, the radiophore has a half-life of about 80 minutes to about 8 hours. In this embodiment, the method relates to diagnosing and/or monitoring active atherosclerotic plaques in blood vessel walls. In one aspect, the ligand, such as a vitamin, or an analog or derivative thereof, binds to a receptor which is preferentially expressed, uniquely expressed, or overexpressed on the surface of activated macrophages relative to resting macrophages, is conjugated to a radiophore. The conjugates are administered to a patient being evaluated for atherosclerosis. The conjugates bind to activated macrophages associated with active atherosclerotic plaques. The radiation emitted by the radiophore is detected extra-corporeally using positron emission tomography. Accordingly, the conjugates can be used to distinguish active atherosclerotic plaques, containing activated macrophages, from inactive plaques wherein the plaques are present in the arteries or veins of a patient being evaluated for atherosclerosis. It is understood that many unstable, i.e., active, atherosclerotic plaques are capable of rupturing and causing acute atherosclerotic syndromes. Even so, such atherosclerotic plaques may not in all cases produce luminal narrowing of blood vessels, particularly in the coronary circulation. Thus, the method of the present invention represents a significant advance in diagnosing and/or monitoring the risk of myocardial infarction, and in evaluating the need for clinical intervention, in patients suffering from atherosclerosis. As described herein referring to compounds, the term โuseful in positron emission tomographyโ means a compound that emits positron radiation capable of producing a pair of annihilation photons moving in opposite directions, the annihilation photons being produced as a result of positron annihilation with an electron. Those photons are capable of being detected by positron emission tomography (PET) using a suitable extra-corporeal device. In one embodiment of the compounds described herein, the conjugate B-L-X is of the formula wherein V is a vitamin receptor binding moiety, or an analog or derivative thereof; L is an optional bivalent linker; n is an integer selected from 1 to about 100; Ar is an aryl group, including a heteroaryl group, that includes one or more substituents (Rf)m comprising a radiophore or a precursor to a radiophore, such as a nitro group and the like. In one variation, the integer n is in the range from 1 to about 20, or in the range from 3 to about 8. In one aspect, Rf includes one or more substituents, where at least one of said substituents is a nitro or a fluoro; and m is an integer selected from 1 to about 3. In another aspect, Ar is a precursor for preparing an 18F fluoroaryl radiophore, and accordingly Rf comprises one or more nitro groups. In another aspect, Ar is an 18F fluoroaryl radiophore where Rf comprises one or more fluoro groups. It is therefore to be understood that in aspects where the integer m is greater than 1, Rf may include more then one nitro group, or Rf may include both fluoro and nitro, or Rf may include more than one fluoro group. It is also to be understood that the fluorine isotopes found in the various embodiments and aspects, and variations described herein may be selected from 18F and 19F, or isotopic combinations thereof. The vitamins, or analogs or derivatives thereof, or other ligands conjugated to a radiophore useful in PET, are used to diagnose and/or monitor disease states using an extra-corporeal device. PET detection using an extra-corporeal device is also referred to as a โPET scan,โ and devices for extra-corporeal detection using PET are well known in the art. In accordance with embodiments where the conjugates bind to activated monocytes or macrophages, the conjugates can be formed from a wide variety of ligands and radiophores, including any ligand that binds to a receptor overexpressed, uniquely expressed, or preferentially expressed on the surface of activated monocytes or activated macrophages that is not expressed or presented or is not present in significant amounts on the surface of resting monocytes or macrophages. For activated macrophages, such ligands include N-formyl peptides, such as formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, high mobility group factor 1 protein (HMGB1), hyaluronan (also referred to as hyaluronic acid and/or hyaluronate), and fragments thereof, heat shock proteins, including HSP-70, toll-like receptor ligands, scavenger receptor ligands, co-receptors for antigen presentation, ligands that bind to the CD68, BER-MAG3, RFD7, CD4, CD14, and HLA-D markers on activated macrophages, ligands that bind to urokinase plasminogen activator receptors, such as the WX-360 peptide, antibodies, or fragments thereof, that bind preferentially to activated macrophages, and vitamins or receptor-binding vitamin analogs and derivatives. For monocytes, the monocyte-binding ligand can be any ligand that binds to a receptor expressed or overexpressed on activated monocytes including CD40, CD16, CD14, CD11b, and CD62 binding ligands, 5-hydroxytryptamine, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-ฮฑ, MIP-2, receptor activator of nuclear factor KB ligand antagonists, monocyte chemotactic protein 1-binding ligands, chemokine receptor 5 binding ligands, RANTES binding ligands, chemokine receptor-binding ligands, and vitamins or receptor-binding vitamin analogs and derivatives, and the like. The conjugates are capable of preferentially binding to activated monocytes or activated macrophages compared to resting monocytes or macrophages due to preferential expression of the receptor for the ligand on activated monocytes or macrophages. In the above-described embodiments, the ligand, such as the vitamin or analog or derivative thereof, can be any ligand that binds to a receptor which is preferentially expressed, uniquely expressed, or overexpressed the surface of cancer cells, or activated monocytes or activated macrophages relative to resting monocytes or macrophages. Exemplary of such ligands are vitamins selected from the group consisting of folate receptor-binding ligands, biotin receptor-binding ligands, vitamin B12 receptor-binding ligands, riboflavin receptor-binding ligands, thiamine receptor-binding ligands, and other vitamin receptor-binding ligands, or analogs or derivatives thereof. Acceptable vitamin moieties that can be used in accordance with the invention include niacin, pantothenic acid, folic acid, riboflavin, thiamine, biotin, vitamin B12, and the lipid soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. In one aspect, these vitamins, and their receptor-binding analogs and derivatives, constitute the targeting entity that can be coupled with a radiophore, capable of emitting radiation, to form the conjugates for use in accordance with the invention. One illustrative group of vitamin moieties includes folic acid, biotin, riboflavin, thiamine, vitamin B12, and receptor-binding analogs and derivatives of these vitamin molecules, and other related vitamin receptor-binding molecules. Further illustrative vitamins and analogs and derivatives thereof are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,488, entirely incorporated herein by reference. In another embodiment, the vitamin receptor-binding ligand can be folic acid, a folic acid analog, or another folate receptor-binding molecule. Exemplary of a vitamin analog is a folate analog containing a glutamic acid residue in the D configuration, where it is understood that folic acid normally contains one glutamic acid in the L configuration linked to pteroic acid. Other analogs of folate that can be used include folinic acid, pteropolyglutamic acid, and folate receptor-binding pteridines such as tetrahydropterins, dihydrofolates, tetrahydrofolates, and their deaza and dideaza analogs. The terms โdeazaโ and โdideazaโ analogs refers to the art recognized analogs having a carbon atom substituted for one or two nitrogen atoms in the naturally occurring folic acid structure. For example, the deaza analogs include the 1-deaza, 3-deaza, 5-deaza, 8-deaza, and 10-deaza analogs. The dideaza analogs include, for example, 1,5 dideaza, 5,10-dideaza, 8,10-dideaza, and 5,8-dideaza analogs. The foregoing folic acid analogs are conventionally termed โfolates,โ reflecting their capacity to bind to folate receptors. Other folate receptor-binding analogs include aminopterin, amethopterin (methotrexate), N10-methylfolate, 2-deamino-hydroxyfolate, deaza analogs such as 1-deazamethopterin or 3-deazamethopterin, and 3โฒ,5โฒ-dichloro-4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroylglutamic acid (dichloromethotrexate). In another aspect, compounds described herein are radiophores and emit radiation that is useful in diagnostic and/or monitoring methods employing positron emission tomography. The compounds emit positron radiation capable of producing a pair of annihilation photons moving in opposite directions, the annihilation photons are produced as a result of positron annihilation with an electron. In one aspect, the radiophore is generally a radioisotope linked to another chemical structure, such as aryl rings, including heteroaryl rings. In another aspect, the radiophore can comprise the radioisotope alone. In any or all of the above-described embodiments, the radiophore may include a positron-emitting isotope having a suitable half-life and toxicity profile. In various embodiments, the radioisotope has a half-life of more than 30 minutes, more than 70 minutes, more than 80 minutes, more than 90 minutes, more than 100 minutes, less than 8 hours, less than 6 hours, less than 4 hours, or less than 3 hours. In other embodiments, the radioisotope has a half-life of about 30 minutes to about 4 hours, about 70 minutes to about 4 hours, about 80 minutes to about 4 hours, about 90 minutes to about 4 hours, about 100 minutes to about 4 hours, about 30 minutes to about 6 hours, about 70 minutes to about 6 hours, about 80 minutes to about 6 hours, about 90 minutes to about 6 hours, about 100 minutes to about 6 hours, about 30 minutes to about 8 hours, about 70 minutes to about 8 hours, about 80 minutes to about 8 hours, about 90 minutes to about 8 hours, or about 100 minutes to about 8 hours. The compounds includes a useful positron emitting isotope. A suitable radiophore may be prepared using the fluorine isotope 18F. Other useful positron-emitting isotopes may also be employed, such as 34Cl, 45Ti, 51Mn, 61Cu, 63Zn, 82Rb, 68Ga, 66Ga, 11C, 13N, 15O, and 18F. In one illustrative embodiment, the radioisotope is selected from 64Cu, 68Ga, 66Ga, and 18F. Factors that may be included during selection of a suitable isotope include sufficient half-life of the positron-emitting isotope to permit preparation of a diagnostic composition in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier prior to administration to the patient, and sufficient remaining half-life to yield sufficient activity to permit extra-corporeal measurement by a PET scan. Further, a suitable isotope should have a sufficiently short half-life to limit patient exposure to unnecessary radiation. In an illustrative embodiment, 18F, having a half-life of 110 minutes, provides adequate time for preparation of the diagnostic composition, as well as an acceptable deterioration rate. Further, on decay 18F is converted to 18O. In one illustrative embodiment, the isotope should have sufficient chemical activity to permit the isotope to become bound to a chemical compound and in turn to the ligand, whether or not a linker is used. Isotopes of elements having toxic properties can be avoided. Positron-decaying isotopes having suitable half-lives include: 34Cl, half-life about 32 minutes; 45Ti, half-life about 3 hours; 51Mn, half-life about 45 minutes; 61Cu, half-life about 3.4 hours; 63Zn, half-life about 38 minutes; 82Rb, half-life about 2 minutes; 68Ga, half-life about 68 minutes, 66Ga, half-life about 9.5 hours, 11C, half-life about 20 minutes, 15O, half-life about 2 minutes, 13N, half-life about 10 minutes, or 18F, half-life about 110 minutes. In illustrative embodiments, the radioisotope is covalently attached to an aromatic group, such as an aryl or heteroaryl group. Illustrative aryl and heteroaryl groups include benzamidyl, benzylic, phenyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, and like groups, other aromatic groups, including polycyclic aryl groups such as, naphthyl, benzothiazolyl, benzimizolyl, benzoxazolyl, and like groups. In one illustrative embodiment, the radioisotope is 18F and the radiophore includes an aryl group to which the radioisotope is covalently attached. The conjugates can bind with high affinity to receptors on cancer cells or activated monocytes or activated macrophages. It is understood that the high affinity binding can be inherent to the ligand or the binding affinity can be enhanced by the use of a chemically modified ligand (i.e., an analog or a derivative) or by the particular chemical linkage, in the conjugate, between the ligand and the radiophore. The chemical linkage in the conjugate between the ligand and the radiophore can be a direct linkage or can be through an intermediary linker. If present, an intermediary linker can be any biocompatible linker known in the art. Illustratively, the linker comprises a chain of about 1 to about 50 atoms selected from carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms. In one variation, the linker comprises a chain of about 5 to about 25 atoms. In alternate embodiments, the linkers described herein may also include phosphorus atoms. In another illustrative variation, the linker is a lower molecular weight linker, such as a linker having an approximate molecular weight less than about 1000, or illustratively in the range of about 30 to about 500. Additional illustrative linkers and linking methods useful in the compounds and methods described herein, including the synthetic preparation thereof, are described in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 10/765,336 and 60/590,580, each entirely incorporated herein by reference. Any other linkers or linking methods known in the art can also be used. Generally, any manner of forming a conjugate between the ligand and the radiophore, or alternatively between an optional linker and the ligand, or between an optional linker and the radiophore can be utilized in the compounds and methods described herein. Alternatively, with or without a linker, the conjugate can be formed by conjugation of the components of the conjugate, for example, through hydrogen, ionic, or covalent bonds. Illustratively, covalent bonding of the components of the conjugate is used, for example, through the formation of ether, amino, amide, ester, disulfide, thiol, hydrazino, hydrazono, imino, and/or hydroxylimino bonds carbon fragments bearing the appropriate functionalities, such as between acid, aldehyde, hydroxy, amino, sulfhydryl, hydroxylamine, and/or hydrazine groups. Also, the linker can comprise an indirect means for associating the ligand with the radiophore, such as by connection through spacer arms or bridging molecules, or through the use of complexing agents that are incorporated into the conjugate. It is understood that neither direct nor indirect means for association of the radiophore with the receptor binding ligand in formation of the conjugates described herein should prevent the binding of the ligand to the receptor on the cancer cells or activated monocytes or activated macrophages for the desirable operation of the method of the present invention. In another illustrative aspect, the linker contributes to water solubility of the conjugate, or at least does not materially detract from water solubility. Advantageous linkers for water solubility include water soluble polymers such as dextran, cellulose ethers, amino acid, oligopeptide and polypeptide linkers of varying lengths, and polyalkylene glycols, including polyethylene glycols of varying lengths. In another embodiment, such polymers have a molecular weight of less than about 1000, or have a molecular weight in the range of about 30 to about 500. In addition, linkers including carboxylic acid bearing amino acids, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid, and linkers including amino groups, such as ornithine, lysine, and arginine are also described herein. In addition, highly water soluble linkers such as carbohydrate linkers, and linkers of carbohydrate analogs and derivatives, such as those described in U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 60/946,092, entirely incorporated herein by reference, may also be included in the optional linker L. In another embodiment, the hydrophilic spacer linkers described herein include a polyether, such as the linkers of the following formulae: where m is an integer independently selected in each instance from 1 to about 8; p is an integer selected 1 to about 10; and n is an integer independently selected in each instance from 1 to about 3. In one aspect, m is independently in each instance 1 to about 3. In another aspect, n is 1 in each instance. In another aspect, p is independently in each instance about 4 to about 6. Illustratively, the corresponding polypropylene polyethers corresponding to the foregoing are contemplated herein and may be included in the conjugates as hydrophilic spacer linkers. In addition, it is appreciated that mixed polyethylene and polypropylene polyethers may be included in the conjugates as hydrophilic spacer linkers. Further, cyclic variations of the foregoing polyether compounds, such as those that include tetrahydrofuranyl, 1,3-dioxanes, 1,4-dioxanes, and the like are contemplated herein. In another illustrative embodiment, the hydrophilic spacer linkers described herein include a plurality of hydroxyl functional groups, such as linkers that incorporate monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides, and the like. It is to be understood that the polyhydroxyl containing spacer linkers comprises a plurality of โ(CROH)โ groups, where R is hydrogen or alkyl. In another illustrative embodiment, linkers are described that may also limit the rate of excretion of the conjugate from the patient by permitting the ligand to associate with the site of interest, such as cancer cells or activated monocytes or activated macrophages before being excreted in the bile from the liver, or in the urine. A linker may facilitate, or may delay metabolic consumption of the conjugate such as by retarding reticuloendothelial system uptake, particularly by the liver. A linker may also help avoid association of the conjugate with non-target organs, cells, fluids, or proteins. If, for example, the conjugate associated with a serum protein, the PET scan would provide a scan of the patient's blood vessels generally, in contrast to the specific location of cancer cells or activated monocytes or activated macrophages sought. Also, the linker may facilitate or accelerate a preferred route of excretion of the conjugate, such as through urine, for example, by encouraging the patient to drink significant fluids after the administration of the conjugate. In addition, it is understood that including a hydrophilic or plurality of hydrophilic groups on the linker may direct the conjugate to preferential clearance by the kidney rather than the liver. In another embodiment of the compounds described herein, the conjugate B-L-X is of the formula wherein V is a vitamin receptor binding moiety, or an analog or derivative thereof; L is an optional bivalent linker; n is an integer selected from 1 to about 100; Rf is as defined in the various embodiments herein; and m is an integer selected from 1 to about 3. In one variation, the integer n is in the range from 1 to about 20, or in the range from 3 to about 8. In another embodiment of the compounds described herein, the conjugate B-L-X is of the formula wherein L is an optional bivalent linker; n is an integer selected from 1 to about 100; Rf is as defined in the various embodiments herein; and m is an integer selected from 1 to about 3. In one variation, the integer n is in the range from 1 to about 20, or in the range from 3 to about 8. In the embodiment where the ligand is folic acid, an analog/derivative of folic acid, or any other folate receptor-binding molecule, the folate, or analog/derivative thereof, can be conjugated to the linker by an art-recognized procedure that utilizes trifluoroacetic anhydride to prepare ฮณ-esters of folic acid via a pteroyl azide intermediate. This procedure results in the synthesis of folate, conjugated to the linker selectively through the ฮณ-carboxy group of the glutamic acid groups of folate. Alternatively, folic acid analogs can be coupled by art-recognized procedures through the ฮฑ-carboxy moiety of the glutamic acid group or both the ฮฑ and ฮณ carboxylic acid entities. In embodiments where the linker includes one or more amino acids, including either or both naturally and non-naturally occurring amino acids, folic acid may be coupled to such amino acids, or peptide intermediates, to prepare folate linkers, and analogs and derivatives of folic acid, that may be coupled to the radiophore. Such amino acid coupling reactions may also be performed on resins, such as Merrifield resins, Wang resins, Universal resins, and the like. Additional details for processes of preparing peptide linker intermediates of pteroic acid and folic acid, and analogs and derivatives of each, are described in PCT international application publication WO 2006/071754, entirely incorporated herein by reference. Illustratively, pteroic acid, or an analog or derivative thereof, is prepared by amidase or protease degradation of folic acid, or the corresponding analog or derivative thereof. For example, carboxypeptidase G, and like proteases, may be used. The resulting pteroic acid may be protected to allow for the selective functionalization of the alpha or gamma carboxylates, such as by protection of the N(10) amine. An illustrative synthesis is shown in the following scheme: (a) Carboxypeptidase G, 0.1M Tris base/ZnCl2; (b) (i) (F3CCO)2O, (ii) 3% TFA.

In another illustrative embodiment of the compounds described herein, where the optional linker is a polyalkylene glycol, the solid supported intermediate is connected to a radiophore precursor, such as a nitroaryl group Ar1, where Ar1 includes phenyl, naphthyl, and the like, and heteroaryl, such as pyridinyl, piperidinyl, benzoxazole, benzothiazole, and the like, each of which is substituted with at least one nitro group, as shown in the following scheme, where n is an integer from 1 to about 100, from 1 to about 20, or is illustratively in the range from about 3 to about 8: (a) (i) 20% piperidine in DMF, (ii) HOBt, HBTU, DIPEA, DMF, 4-nitrobenzoic acid OR 2,5-dinitrobenzoic acid; (b) (i) 2% NH2NH2 in DMF, (ii) TFA/TIPS/H2O (95:2.5:2.5). The foregoing scheme is illustrated for nitroaryl containing carboxylic acids; however, it is to be understood that additional nitroaryl containing compounds, including nitroheteroaryl containing compounds, may be used by the appropriate selection of an attachment atom. For example, reverse amides are described herein, where in the above scheme, the PEG intermediate terminates in a carboxylic acid and the nitroaryl containing group is an aniline, or the corresponding aryl or heteroaryl variation thereof, such as 3-nitro-5-aminopyridine, and the like. Further, thioamides, ureas, ethers, esters, and other chemical links are described herein for attaching the nitroaryl group.

The foregoing scheme is illustrated for fluoroaryl containing carboxylic acids; however, it is to be understood that additional fluoroaryl containing compounds, including fluoroheteroaryl containing compounds, may be used by the appropriate selection of an attachment atom. For example, reverse amides are described herein, where in the above scheme, the PEG intermediate terminates in a carboxylic acid and the fluoroaryl containing group is an aniline, or the corresponding aryl or heteroaryl variation thereof, such as 3-fluoro-5-aminopyridine, and the like. Further, thioamides, ureas, ethers, esters, and other chemical links are described herein for attaching the fluoroaryl group. It is to be understood that the compounds described herein may include more than one nitro group that may be converted into the corresponding fluoro group. It is also to be understood that the above illustrative syntheses are applicable for preparing both the 19F and 18F fluoroaryl compounds, though it is appreciated that the 18F fluororaryl compounds are adapted for use in the imaging methods described herein using PET. In another illustrative embodiment, the nitroaryl and the fluoroaryl group is the corresponding phenyl group, as shown in the following scheme where Rf is selected from nitro and fluoro, providing that at least one of Rf is fluoro; m is 1, 2, or 3; and n is an integer from 1 to about 20, and is illustratively 3 or 5: (a) TBA19F, DMSO; RT, 5-30 min; OR OF, 18-Crown-6, DMSO, higher temperature; OR (c) TBAF, NaHCO3, DMSO, low temperature; OR KF, Kryptofix-222, NaHCO3, DMSO, higher temperature.

It is appreciated that PEG linkers of varying lengths, such as 3, 4, 5, or 6 repeating units may be prepared according to this synthetic procedure. It is also to be understood that the fluorination agent is either an 18F or a 19F fluorination reagent, or an isotopic mixture thereof. Additional fluorodenitrofication processes using radioactive conditions such as TBA18F/DMSO or K18F/DMSO are described herein, as shown in the following scheme. It is appreciated that these processes may also be adapted to include non-radioisotopes of fluorine, including 19F, or isotopic mixtures thereof. (a) 1.3 eq. anhydrous TBA18F, anhydrous DMSO, 30 min; yield >95%; (b) 1.3 eq. anhydrous TBA18F, anhydrous DMSO, <5 min; yield >95%.

Ed. 2006, 45, 2720-2725, each entirely incorporated herein by reference. In an alternate process, the radioisotope may be introduced into an intermediate compound rather than the final compound. Illustratively, compounds described herein may be prepared as follows, where LG is a leaving group: where n is an integer selected from 1 to about 100; in the range from 1 to about 20, or in the range from 3 to about 8. It is understood that either or both of 18F and 19F isotopes, and mixtures thereof, may be prepared according to the above process. In an alternate process, the compounds described herein may be prepared as follows: where n is an integer selected from 1 to about 100; in the range from 1 to about 20, or in the range from 3 to about 8. It is understood that either or both of 18F and 19F isotopes, and mixtures thereof, may be prepared according to the above process. In an alternate process, the compounds described herein may be prepared as follows: (a) HATU/DIPEA, 3 min., >95%; (b) TFA/phenol/H2O/TIPS 90:4:5:1, 37ยฐ C., 10 min.>95% or ambient temperature, 20 min, 65%. where n is an integer selected from 1 to about 100; in the range from 1 to about 20, or in the range from 3 to about 8. It is understood that either or both of 18F and 19F isotopes, and mixtures thereof, may be prepared according to the above process. Additional synthetic details are described in Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 10:1501-1503 (2000), entirely incorporated herein by reference. In an alternate process, the compounds described herein may be prepared as follows: where n is an integer selected from 1 to about 100; in the range from 1 to about 20, or in the range from 3 to about 8. It is understood that either or both of 18F and 19F isotopes, and mixtures thereof, may be prepared according to the above process. It is to be understood that the fluorodenitrification step described in the various process embodiments may take place at various steps in the process. However, it is appreciated that conversion late in the synthesis carries the advantage of minimizing the decay time of the radioisotope during imaging agent preparation. However, even when the fluorodenitrification step is performed on an intermediate, the elapsed time complete conversion is as follows: about 3 min for radiolabeling, about 7 min for cleave from the resin, overall time including purification about 25-30 min., radiochemical labeling yield about 70-80%. The amount of the conjugate effective for use in accordance with the methods described herein depends on many parameters, including the molecular weight of the conjugate, its route of administration, and its tissue distribution. Illustratively, an โeffective amountโ of the conjugate is an amount sufficient to bind to cancer cells or activated monocytes or activated macrophages and to be useful in the diagnosis and/or monitoring of cancer or disease states involving activated monocytes or activated macrophages. The effective amount of the conjugate to be administered to a patient being evaluated for cancer or disease states involving activated monocytes or activated macrophages can range from about 1 pg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, 1 ng/kg to about 10 mg/kg, or from about 10 ฮผg/kg to about 1 mg/kg, or from about 100 ฮผg/kg to about 500 ฮผg/kg. The conjugate can be administered in one or more doses, such as from about 1 to about 3 doses, prior to detection with the extra-corporeal PET imaging device. The number of doses depends on the molecular weight of the conjugate, its route of administration, and its tissue distribution, among other factors. When used for diagnosis and/or monitoring of cancer or disease states involving activated monocytes or activated macrophages, the extra-corporeal detection procedure is typically performed about 1 minute to about 6 hours post-administration of the conjugate, but the extra-corporeal detection procedure can be performed at any time post-administration of the conjugate as long as binding of the conjugate to cancer cells or activated monocytes or activated macrophages is detectable and sufficient time is allowed for elimination of a substantial fraction of the unbound conjugate from the body. The conjugates administered in accordance with the methods described herein are preferably administered parenterally to the patient, for example, intravenously, intradermally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intraperitoneally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Alternatively, the conjugates can be administered to the patient by other medically useful procedures such as in an orally available formulation. It is appreciated that any patient suspected of having cancer or a disease state involving activated monocytes or activated macrophages, whether symptomatic or not, who would benefit from an evaluation using the method of the present invention can be evaluated. The conjugates used in accordance with the methods are used in one aspect of this invention to formulate diagnostic compositions comprising effective amounts of the conjugate and an acceptable carrier therefor. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include aqueous solutions of the conjugate, for example, a solution in isotonic saline, 5% glucose or other well-known pharmaceutically acceptable liquid carriers such as alcohols, glycols, esters and amides. Any orally available dosage forms known in the art can also be used. The conjugates use in the methods described herein are formed to target and, thus, to concentrate the conjugate at the site of a tumor or at the site of accumulation of activated monocytes or activated macrophages, such as activated macrophages adhering to the luminal endothelial layer of the plaque or activated macrophages present in the lipid-rich core of the plaque in the patient. Several aspects of the methods described herein may be advantageous in the detection of cancer cells or activated monocytes or activated macrophages. In one embodiment, the radiophore comprises an elemental isotope which is a positron emitter. Positron emitters emit in three dimensions from the source atom, but the emission proceeds in two parts in exactly opposite directions. As the anti-particle of the electron, when the positron from a decaying isotope comes in contact with electrons in nearby matter, it annihilates emitting energy from the annihilation as gamma rays. To conserve momentum, the gamma ray photons travel in opposite directions. Because the positron has two radiation rays available for detection, the location in the patient where the conjugate has accumulated is more readily and therefore more accurately, detected within a time frame reasonable for patient diagnosis. The signal-to-noise ratio of positron annihilation is markedly improved over unidirectional gamma rays. Further, by back-projecting coincident rays, the location of the source emission is located. PET is presently used in medical centers as a diagnostic tool for the detection of cancer. In cancer diagnosis, a patient may be administered glucose that has been tagged with a positron emitter, such as 18F fluorodeoxyglucose, because glucose concentrates in fast-growing cancer cells. The presence of a cancer may be detected by the concentration of the PET imaging agent. Also, the location of the cancer in the body is determined by back-projecting the coincident gamma radiation by means of the PET scanner. Thus, the methods described herein may be used in combination with 18F fluorodeoxyglucose to detect cancer cells. The methods may also be used in combination with any other methods of cancer diagnosis already developed and known in the art, including methods using other already developed diagnostic agents and utilizing x-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), ultrasound, and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). In other embodiments, the methods described herein can be used alone or in combination with any other method(s) known in the art for the detection, analysis, and/or ablation of atherosclerotic plaques. For example, the methods can be used in combination with methods to ablate atherosclerotic plaques in cases where active plaques cause narrowing of blood vessels. In such cases, the conjugates described herein can be used not only to identify active atherosclerotic plaques as compared to inactive plaques, but also to distinguish between atherosclerotic and normal tissue to aid in ablation procedures. Thus, the methods and compositions can be used to analyze both the physiological and the morphological state of atherosclerotic plaques. For example, angioplasty involves the non-surgical widening of a vessel narrowed by plaque deposition, and laser energy, for example, directed through optical fibers in a catheter-based device, can be used to ablate or partially remove the plaque deposits. Catheter-based devices for ablating plaques using laser energy are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,817,601, 4,850,351, and 4,950,266, each entirely incorporated herein by reference. It is understood that in certain applications of the methods described herein, each of the processes and synthetic methods described herein either substantially complete fluorination, or alternatively only partial fluorination may be desired. Accordingly, the processes and synthetic methods described herein may be performed in various alternative embodiments. It is therefore understood that in those aspects where only partial fluorination is desired, the processes and syntheses described herein may be performed with less than stoichiometric amounts of fluorinating agent. Similarly, it is understood that in certain applications of the methods described herein, each of the processes and synthetic methods described herein either substantially complete radiofluorination, or alternatively only partial radiofluorination may be desired. Accordingly, the processes and synthetic methods described herein may be performed in various alternative embodiments. It is therefore understood that in those aspects where only partial radiofluorination is desired, the processes and syntheses described herein may be performed with less than stoichiometric amounts of radiofluorination agent, where the balance is optionally 19F. It is further understood that in certain applications of the methods described herein, each of the processes and synthetic methods described herein wherein there is present more than one nitro group, reactions may selected in various alternative embodiments. In one alternative, stoichiometric amounts of the fluorination agent are included to substantially convert each nitro group into the corresponding fluoro group. In another alternative, the amount of fluorination agent is selected to substantially convert only a subset of nitro groups, such as one or two nitro groups out of three that may be present; or in one variation, one nitro group out of two that may be present. In another variation, less than one equivalent of fluorinating agent is included in the process to only partially convert at least one nitro group to the corresponding fluoro group. It is appreciated that the various embodiments are selected to suit the intensity of labeling needs for the methods described herein. It is appreciated that in those aspects where substantial conversion of all nitro groups present will not take place, the presence of additional nitro groups may act as activating groups to decrease the reaction time or to increase the overall conversion to the desired partial level of fluorination. Accordingly, also contemplated herein are compounds that may include additional electron withdrawing groups, or alternative electron withdrawing groups other than nitro that we either decrease the reaction time or to increase the overall conversion to the desired partial level of fluorination. The following examples are described and intended to further illustrate selected embodiments of the invention described herein. The following examples should not be construed as limiting the invention in any way. EXAMPLES 18F N-Hydroxysuccinimde 4-Fluorobenzoate (a) methyl triflate; (b) 18F/K2CO3/Kryptofix (K2.2.2, Aldrich Catalog number 29, 111-0), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 90ยฐ C., 10 min.; (c) NaOH, 90ยฐ C., 5 min.; (d) N-Hydroxysuccinimide tetramethylurea (TSTU), CH3CN, 120ยฐ C., 5 min. The p-fluorobenzoic acid may be purified and concentrated by the addition of sufficient HCl to fully protonate the p-fluorobenzoic acid, which are isolated on a reverse phase C18 column such as a C18 SepPak Plus sold by Waters Corp. Milford Mass. The column may be washed with HCl acidified water to remove any water soluble contaminants. The p-fluorobenzoic acid may be eluted from the column with methanol followed by further contaminant removal on a cationic ion-exchange column (e.g., a Dowex column), and concentration by evaporation of the methanol. It is to be understood that the foregoing synthesis is also used to make isotopic mixtures that include 18F and 19F. The N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of p-fluorobenzoic acid may be concentrated and purified after isolation by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography in a mixture of water/acetonitrile/and sufficient trifluoroacetic acid to preserve an acidic pH. A water diluted solution of the ester may be concentrated on a C18 SepPak column followed by elution with diethyl ether. Residual water may be removed using a column of anhydrous Mg2SO4. After evaporation of the ether to dryness, the ester may be re-dissolved in CH3CN. An alternate synthesis of 18F-SFB was performed using a procedure modified from that described in Eur. J. Med. Mol. Imaging, vol. 31: 469-474 (2004), entirely incorporated herein by reference. Starting from 18F-fluorobenzoic acid, prepared as described in processes described herein, an oil bath was set up at 90ยฐ C. A solution was made of 45% tetramethlyammonium hydroxide (TMAH) in water. In a separate vial, 10.0 mg of 4-fluorobenzoic acid was added (solution 1). In a separate vial, 40 ฮผl of 45% TMAH was added (solution 2). Then 0.2 ml of water and 1.0 ml of acetonitrile was added and solution 2 was added to solution 1 (solution 3). The solution was evaporated to dryness. In another vial, 14 mg of TSTU was added to 1.2 ml acetonitrile (solution 4). Solution 4 was added to solution 3. The mixture was heated to 90 degrees Celsius in an oil bath for 2 minutes. Radioactive 18F will be synthesized in a cyclotron by procedures well-known in the art and used to prepare (18F)-para-fluorobenzoic acid, as shown in Example 1, which will then be converted to 18F-SFB as described above. It is appreciated that the foregoing processes may be used with other aromatic carboxylic acids having a dimethylamine group to prepare the corresponding 18F labeled radiophore for conjugation as described herein. In addition, it is to be understood that in the foregoing illustrative process, the intermediate (18F)SFB may be coupled to any other folic acid, or analog or derivative thereof, through an optional linker as described herein to form a conjugate. It is further appreciated that the aryl ring may be optionally substituted. N(10)-TFA Pteroic Acid. The synthesis was performed as described in WO 2006/009153. Briefly, zinc chloride was added to a solution of folic acid dissolved in 0.1M tris base. Carboxypeptidase G was added to the reaction while stirring. The pH was adjusted to about 7.3 using 1N HCl and temperature was raised to 30ยฐ C. The reaction vessel was covered with aluminum foil and stirred for 7 days. The pH was adjusted as needed to about 7.3. The pH was lowered to about pH 3.0 using 6N HCl. The resulting precipitate was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was decanted and lyophilized for 48 h. Pteroic acid was purified using ion exchange column, and the fractions lyophilized for 48 h. The pteroic acid was dried under vacuum for 24 h and then kept under argon for 30 min. Trifluoroacetic anhydride was added and stirred at room temperature under argon for 4 days (the reaction vessel was wrapped with aluminum foil). Progression of the reaction was monitored by analytical HPLC (Waters, X-Bridge C18; 3.0ร50 mm, 1% B to 50% B in 30 min, 80% B wash 35 min run) until a single peak was observed (A=280 nm, 320 nm). The solvent was evaporated and 3% TFA in water was added followed by stirring for two days. After centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 20 min, the solvent was decanted and solid was washed with water, and centrifuged three times. The TFA protected pteroic acid was lyophilized for 48 h. Universal Folate Resin. Universal Folate resin was synthesized using Universal NovaTagโข resin (Novabiochem; Catalog #04-12-3910), as described in Novabiochem Letters 1-4 (2004); Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 15:5442-5445 (2005), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. After swelling the resin with dichloromethane (DCM), and then with DMF, the Fmoc was removed with 20% piperidine in DMF. The resulting Fmoc-Glu-OtBu was coupled using HATU [2-(1H-7-Azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl uronium hexafluorophosphate] and DIPEA (N,N-Diisopropylethylamine) in DMF. Similarly, N10-TFA Pteroic was coupled using standard Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). The pendant Mmt (4-Methoxytrityl) was removed with 1M HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole) in DCM/trifluoroethanol. The resin may be washed with DMF and immediately used again, or it may be washed with DCM/DMF and then with MeOH and dried for later use. Folate PEG Conjugates of Radiophore Precursors. Fmoc-(PEG)6-CO2H was coupled to Universal folate resin using HOBt/HBTU (O-Benzotriazole-N,N,Nโฒ,Nโฒ-tetramethyl-uronium-hexafluoro-phosphate)/DIPEA in DMF. The Fmoc group was removed using 20% piperidine and then either 4-nitrobenzoic acid or 2,5-dinitrobenzoic acid was introduced using HOBt/HBTU/DIPEA in DMF. A hydrazine solutions (2%) was used to deprotect the N10-TFA group, followed by treatment with TFA/triisopropylsilane/water to cleave the compound from the resin and deprotect the tertiary butyl groups. The solvent was concentrated under vacuum and the compounds were precipitated using diethyl ether. Both folate-nitro-phenyl conjugates were purified using reverse phase preparative HPLC (Waters, NovaPak C18; 19ร300 mm) A=10 mM NH4OAc (pH=7.0), B=Acetonitrile; ฮป=320 nm; solvent gradient: 1% B to 50% B in 25 min, 80% B wash 40 min run.

The reverse phase HPLC was performed using a C18 column and the following gradient water/0.1% TFA in CH3CN at 77:23 for 10 min, 60:40 for 10 min, 50:50 for 10 min, 40:60 for 10 min, and using a flow rate of 1.0 ml/minute. Analysis by ESI-MS. Impure and purified samples of folate conjugates of SFB, and other radiophores may be analyzed by ESI-mass spectrometry. Competitive binding assay using KB cells. Relative binding affinity of the folate-fluoro-phenyl conjugate was evaluated according to the standard literature protocol by Westerhof et. al. (Mol Pharmacol, 1995, 48, 459-471) and C. P. Leamon et. al. (Bioconjugate Chem., 2006, 17 (5), 1226-1232) with minor modification. Relative affinity is defined as the inverse molar ratio of compound required to displace 50% of 3H-folic acid bound to folate receptor (FR) on cells, relative affinity of folic acid=1. Therefore, a relative affinity of the comparative ligand=1 suggests a ligand with equal affinity for FR when compared to folic acid; Relative affinity <1 suggests weaker affinity, and a relative affinity >1 suggest a stronger affinity with respect to folic acid. KB cells (human cervical cancer cell line that shows over expressed FR) were seeded in 48 well falcon plate and allowed to grow adherent monolayer overnight in folate deficient RPMI (Gibco RPMI medium 1640, catalog #27016) that has 10% FBS (Fatal Bovine serum) and 1% PS (penicillin streptomycine). Then cells were incubated with 10 nM 3H-folic acid in the presence of increasing concentration (0.1 nM-1 ฮผM) of cold folic acid (non-radioactive) or folate-fluoro-phenyl conjugate at 37ยฐ C. for 1 h. Then cells were rinsed three times with 250 ฮผL of PBS (phosphate saline buffer) and one time with trichloro-acetic acid. 1% sodium dodecylsulfate (250 ฮผL) in PBS were added to each well and after 10 min cell lysates were transferred to individual vials containing 3 mL of scintillation cocktail and radioactivity was counted. From the plot of bound radio activity verses concentration of unlabeled folate-nitro-phenyl conjugate was used to calculate the IC50 value (concentration of ligand required to block 50% of 3H-folic acid binding). Results shows folate-4-F-phenyl conjugate has equal or higher affinity for FR when compared to folic acid. Having six polyethylene glycol units makes folate-4-F-phenyl conjugates more water soluble when compare to folic acid, so this may be pne of the reason to higher affinity for FR. Serum binding assay was carried out according to the stranded protocol that followed by Endocyte. Briefly, 1 mM folate-fluoro-phenyl conjugate in PBS (pH=7.4) was prepared. Then 190 ฮผL of human serum was added to three separate micro-centrifuge tubes (microcon YM-30 NMWL centrifuge filters 0.5 mL) and 190 ฮผL of PBS (pH=7.4) was added another micro-centrifuge tube. Then 10 ฮผL of 1 mM folate-fluoro-phenyl conjugate was added to each tube to give final volume of 200 ฮผL. Also, 190 ฮผL of human serum plus 10 ฮผL of PBS was added to separate micro-centrifuge tubes as blank test. Al samples were transferred into separate micron 30 spin filters and centrifuged at 10,000รg for 30 min at room temperature. Recovered filtrates were analyzed by analytical HPLC (Waters, X-Bridge C18; 3.0ร50 mm, and they gave a single peak at ฮป=280 nm, 320 nm; 1% B to 50% B in 10 min, 80% B wash 15 min run) and % serum binding was calculated. Since folate-4-F-phenyl conjugate has lower percent serum biding (12.2%), this compound may have lower liver and kidney uptake. 1.
