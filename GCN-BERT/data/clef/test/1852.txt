Synthesis of (S)-3-(5-chloro-1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)pi-peridin-1-yl)propan-1-one Hydrochloride
A solution of hydrogen chloride in diethyl ether (2.0 N, 0.348 mL, 0.696 mmol) was added to a solution of (S)-3-(5-chloro-1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)propan-1-one (0.0800 g, 0.268 mmol) in diethyl ether (1.0 mL) at 0Â° C. The reaction liquid was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour and then stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The white solid precipitated was filtered and collected, washed with diethyl ether (3.0 mL) and dried at room temperature for 36 hours to obtain (S)-3-(5-chloro-1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)propan-1-one hydrochloride (0.0512 g, 0.138 mmol, 51%)(hereinafter referred to as the compound of Example 23) as a white solid.
