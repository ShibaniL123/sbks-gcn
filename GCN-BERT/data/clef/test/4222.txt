FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the prevention and/or treatment of flu infections. More specifically, the present invention is concerned with a combination of ginger and goldenrod for use in methods for preventing and/or treating influenza (flu) infections or their symptoms. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Flu Flu is a contagious illness caused by the influenza virus. Common flu is characterized by an acute infection associated with respiratory problems, intense muscle pain (myalgia), headaches, chills, nasal obstruction, fever, cough, sneezing and sore throat. The majority of the population will generally recover from flu without any complication. Older people, young children and people with deficient immune systems, may have serious complications or may even die from the flu. Current literature describes human common influenza as a serious disease causing each year an estimated 36,000 deaths in the United States only (Roxas, 2007). Yearly common influenza (flu) epidemics result in lost workdays and schooldays as well as a significant number of hospitalization days and even deaths among the elderly, seniors being particularly vulnerable to respiratory infections. Flu is caused by the influenza virus strain A or B, but strain A is usually the one responsible for a pandemic flu (Klenk, 2008). There are several strain A subtypes, labeled according to an H number (for the type of hemagglutinin) and an N number (for the type of neuraminidase). There are 16 different H antigens (H1 to H16) and nine different N antigens (N1 to N9). Influenza A (H1N1) virus is a subtype of influenza A virus and the most common cause of influenza (flu) in humans. Some strains of H1N1 are endemic in humans and cause a fraction of all influenza-like illness and a fraction of all seasonal influenza. The Pandemic H1N1/09 virus is a swine origin Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 virus strain responsible for the 2009 flu pandemic. Flu treatment is possible with drugs such as Oseltamivir (Tamiflu®, Roche) or Zanamivir; which are both inhibitors of neuraminidase, an important enzyme on the surface of the influenza virus (Gubareva LV, 2004). Viruses from the influenza family are known to present a high mutation rate and modifications to their genome may occur every single year, resulting in drug resistance. For example, cases have been observed where the influenza virus strain presented a high resistance to Tamiflu™ treatment (US Centers for Disease Control (CDC)). New influenza strains infecting humans therefore appear from time to time. These strains frequently originate from other species and have adapted to human through mutations. The swine influenza A H1N1 flu virus, also named Swine Flu, has been reported around the world and was declared a pandemic influenza virus. Swine flu H1N1 originally only affected pigs but started infecting humans in North America in 2009. Humans having little to no natural immunity to this virus, it can lead to a serious and widespread illness. Vaccines can prevent flu in 70 to 90% of the cases observed in healthy adults (Bridges CB, 2000; Herrera GA, 2007). However, the flu vaccine has to be redesigned each year because the previous years vaccines are likely to be ineffective against the newly mutated strains . The yearly vaccine is therefore designed before the season begins based on that from the previous year. Since scientists usually cannot predict with accuracy which strain will be dominant, the vaccine may not fully correspond to the new strain. In addition, the flu vaccine is specifically designed against influenza virus strains A and B and does not therefore protect against cold viruses such as rhinovirus and corona types. Flu symptoms can be alleviated with either the previously mentioned treatment or with, for example, 1) over-the-counter analgesics to relieve pain and reduce fever; 2) cough suppressants for dry cough with no mucus; 3) expectorants to help clear mucus so it can be coughed up; and/or 4) decongestants to reduce nasal congestion. Weed Susun "Glorious Goldenrod", 21 June 2009, pages 1-4 discloses tea made from goldenrod crushed leaves and flowers, which when taken hot with honey may be used in the treatment of inter alia colds and flu. CN1931208 discloses the use of common goldenrod herb in the treatment of H5N1 bird flu and influenza. CN1451434 discloses a treatment for SARS based on a medicament containing common goldenrod herb. US2008102140 discloses the use of extracts of Solidago virgaurea (goldenrod) in the treatment of influenza. WO2007056811 discloses the use of ginger in the treatment of cold and flu viruses. There remains a need for alternative compositions for the prevention and/or treatment of flu infections. The present description refers to a number of documents. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Applicants have identified and characterized new properties for a combination of two plants or parts thereof (e.g., their extracts). The combination of the present invention possesses activities which include antiviral in vitro and in vivo capabilities. The two main active components of the combination of the present invention are: 1) ginger; and 2) goldenrod. As used herein, and unless the context in which they occur implicitly or explicitly suggest another meaning for these terms, the terms "ginger" and "goldenrod" refer the whole plants, parts thereof or extracts thereof. These plants and their extracts are recognized as safe substances for humans (German Commission E, Blumenthal M, 1998). Applicants have demonstrated that these plants alone or in combination are effective in preventing and/or treating flu infections. In addition, Applicants discovered that goldenrod and ginger act together and demonstrate a strong (more than additive) antiviral activity, including the inhibition of the influenza virus (Strain A/WS/33, H1 N1) infective activity. Furthermore, Applicants demonstrate herein that an alcoholic extract of goldenrod is more efficient at inhibiting viral infection than other types of extracts such as water extracts. A combination of these two plants (or specific parts or extracts thereof) provides an alternative way of attenuating/alleviating flu symptoms and/or decreasing the duration of the infection period. In addition to its capability to inhibit the influenza virus (e.g., common H1N1 strain as well as H1N1 Swine flu strain) in vitro infective activity, the combination of the present invention has been shown to be active in an in vivo animal model reproducing the influenza virus infection (Strain A/WS/33, H1N1).

DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS The present Applicants have surprisingly discovered that a combination of ginger and goldenrod acts synergistically to reduce the infective activity of flu virus, thereby reducing the progression of the infection, viral titer and associated symptoms. Thus, the present invention is concerned with a combination of ginger and goldenrod acting together to prevent or treat a flu infection. As used herein, the terms "treat/treating/treatment" and "prevent/preventing/prevention", refer to eliciting the desired biological response, i.e., a therapeutic and prophylactic effect, respectively. In accordance with the subject invention, the therapeutic effect comprises a decrease/reduction in the progress of the infection or in the severity or number of associated symptoms or a complete cure of the infection and/or associated symptoms. In accordance with the invention, a prophylactic effect may comprise a delay or decrease/reduction in the onset of, progression of infection, or the severity or number of associated symptoms (e.g., viral titer in the subject's blood or cells, runny nose, plugged nose, sneezing, sore throat, scratchy throat, cough, hoarseness, head congestion, chest congestion, feeling tired, fever, muscle pain, loss of appetite, headache and chills) following administration of a combination/composition of the present invention. In an embodiment, the composition of the present invention, comprising a combination of goldenrod and ginger, completely prevents the subject from contracting a flu infection. The methods, compositions, formulations and uses described herein are suitable for both humans and animals (including birds), preferably mammals. Animals can benefit from the present invention. For example, swine flu and avian flu are major problems in the swine, poultry and cattle industries. Recently, two pandemic strains of influenza, H1N1 (swine flu) and H5N1avian flu affected this industry resulting in significant losses for producers. Available preventive therapies such as vaccine are too costly for extensive use. A natural and antibiotic free treatment such as a phytoremedy, would likely enable a better control of rhinovirus and influenza infection and increase gains of the livestock industry. Other animals (e.g., herd animals including horse, sheep, goats, etc.; and pets such as dogs, cats, etc.) are also prone to flues and would benefit from a preventive treatment or early treatment. Thus, as used herein, the term "subject" in the context of veterinary application of the present invention relates to any mammal including swine, lamb, goat, cow (e.g., beef, veal), bird (e.g., chicken, duck, goose), mouse, rat, monkey, cat, dog, and a horse. In another specific embodiment, it refers to a human. A "subject in need thereof' or a "patient" in the context of the present invention is intended to include any subject that will benefit or that is likely to benefit from the combination of ginger and goldenrod of the present invention. In an embodiment, a subject in need thereof is a subject diagnosed with flu. In another embodiment, a subject in need thereof is a subject that is likely to catch the flu or in which a flu infection is likely to have important health consequences (e.g., young children, elderly or immune deficient subjects, members of herds where at least one animal shows symptoms of infections, etc.). The likelihood of contracting flu can be determined for instance with the prevalence of the disease in the subject's environment including close members of the family (sisters, brothers, parents, grand-parents, uncles and aunts, spouse, colleagues, friends, etc.), members of herds. In an embodiment, a subject in need thereof is a subject suffering from the flu or any associated symptom. As used herein, the term "synergistically" means that two or more substances work together in a cooperative manner so the total effect of the combination is greater than the sum of each of the substances taken individually. Accordingly, the expression "synergistically prevents or treat" a flu infection or associated symptoms means that the combination of the present invention is more effective in reducing the infective activity of the flu, or in relieving an associated symptom, than the sum of the effects of each of goldenrod and ginger acting individually. This includes decreasing the time for recovery or increasing the speed at which symptoms are alleviated or reduced. A synergistic effect is present if, for example, the inhibition of the virus infective activity/capacity (e.g., reduction in the number of plaque forming units (PFU) in infected cell culture) following treatment with a combination of goldenrod and ginger is 80%, while the inhibition of the virus infective activity/capacity following treatment with goldenrod alone is 25% and that of ginger alone is 30% (80% being greater than 25%+30%). As used herein, the term "cold" refers to a contagious viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory system mostly caused by picornaviruses (including rhinoviruses) or coronaviruses. It also includes infections by parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses and enteroviruses. Common symptoms of cold include sore throat, runny nose, nasal congestion, cough and sneezing. As used herein, the term "flu" refers to an infectious disease caused by a RNA virus from the Orthomyxoviridae (influenza virus) family. It affects birds and mammals. Common symptoms of flu include chills, fever, sore throat, scratchy throat, muscle pains, headache, chest congestion, head congestion, coughing, weakness, exhaustion, loss of appetite and general discomfort. The articles "a," "an" and "the" are used herein to refer to one or to more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical objects of the article. The terms "including" and "comprising" are used herein to mean, and are used interchangeably with, the phrases "including but not limited to" and "comprising but not limited to". The terms "such as" is used herein to mean, and is used interchangeably herein with "such as but not limited to". Extracts The two main active/medicinal components of the combination of the present invention are ginger and goldenrod, parts thereof or extracts thereof. In accordance with the present invention, whole ginger root (rhizome) or whole goldenrod reduced to powder (e.g., grinded and dried or lyophilized) can be used in the combination of the present invention. Alternatively, ginger root extract or goldenrod extract can be used. The extract may be from the whole plant or from a part thereof (e.g., the aerial part of goldenrod). In an embodiment, the ginger extract and/or the goldenrod extract is a crude extract (e.g., crude 100% water extract). As used herein, the term "crude" in the expression "crude extract" refers to an unfractionated water extract (e.g., from ginger or goldenrod). A crude extract may be a water concoction or brew of any type wherein ginger root or goldenrod is cut into pieces and/or grinded, optionally lyophilized and mixed with water to obtain a water extract which can be optionally filtered prior to use. Alternatively, an alcoholic extract or CO2 supercritical extract can be used in accordance with the present invention. The goldenrod and ginger extracts used in accordance with the present invention may be home made or laboratory made or may be extracts which are commercially available such as ginger and goldenrod extracts available from Martin Bauer (Italy), Flavex (Germany) or Finzelberg (Germany). In a preferred embodiment, the ginger extract is a CO2 extract obtained from Zingiber officinale root, and the goldenrod extract is a hydroalcoholic extract obtained from the aerial part of Solidago virgaurea. A number of standard extraction techniques known in the art can be used to prepare the plant extracts of the present invention. In general, the extraction process entails contacting solid plant material with a solvent with adequate mixing and for a period of time sufficient to ensure adequate exposure of the solid plant material to the solvent such that desired therapeutic activity (bioactive components) present in the plant material can be taken up by the solvent. As indicated above, the plant material is derived from one or a combination of the species of ginger and goldenrod. Non-limiting examples of goldenrod species that may be used in accordance with the present invention include Solidago albopilosa, Solidago altiplanities, Solidago arguta, Solidago auticulata, Solidago bicolor, Solidago brachyphylla, Solidago buckleyi, Solidago caesia, Solidago calcicola, Solidago califomica, Solidago canadensis, Solidago cutleri, Solidago deamii, Solidago decurrense, Solidago discoidea, Solidago fistulosa, Solidago flaccidifolia, Solidago flexicaulis, Solidago gattingeri, Solidago gigantea, Solidago glomerata, Solidago gracillima, Solidago guiradonis, Solidago hispida, Solidago juliae, Solidago juncea, Solidago laussimifolia, Solidago leavenworthii, Solidago ludoviciana, Solidago macrophylla, Solidago missouriensis, Solidago mollis, Solidago multiradiata, Solidago nana, Solidago nemoralis, Solidago odora, Solidago ouachitensis, Solidago patula, Solidago petiolaris, Solidago pinetorum, Solidago plumosa, Solidago porteri, Solidago puberula, Solidago pulchra, Solidago radula, Solidago roanensis, Solidago rugosa, Solidago rupestris, Solidago sciaphila, Solidago sempervirens, Solidago shortii, Solidago simplex, Solidago simulans, Solidago speciosa, Solidago spectabilis, Solidago spathulata, Solidago sphacelata, Solidago spithamaea, Solidago squarrosa, Solidago stricta, Solidago tortifolia, Solidago tenuifolia, Solidago uliginosa, Solidago ulmifolia, Solidago velutina, Solidago verna, Solidago virgaurea and Solidago wrightii. Preferably, the species of goldenrod is Solidago decurense, Solidago canadensis, Solidago virgaurea or a mixture thereof. In a particular embodiment, the goldenrod species is Solidago virgaurea. The plant material employed in the extraction process can be the entire plant or it can be one or more distinct tissues from the plant or plants, for example, leaves, roots, the aerial part such as flowers and stems, etc. If desired, the plant material can be treated in order to facilitate the extraction process. Typically such treatment results in the plant material being fragmented by some means such that a greater surface area is presented to the solvent. For example, the plant material can be crushed or sliced mechanically, using a grinder or other device to fragment the plant parts into small pieces or particles, or the plant material can be frozen in liquid nitrogen and then crushed or fragmented into smaller pieces. The solvent extraction process employed in the preparation related to the invention typically employs as solvent an aqueous solvent (such as water or a buffer), a liquid organic compound, or a combination thereof. Of course, all of the reagents used for the extraction process must be acceptable for use in humans and other animals or if not, the purification process must ensure that the purified extract is free of any toxic impurities prior to human consumption. Exemplary liquid organic compounds that can be used as solvents in the extraction process to prepare extracts include, but are not limited to, alcoholic solvents, which include primary alcohols such as methyl alcohol (methanol), ethyl alcohol (ethanol), 1-propanol and 1-butanol; secondary alcohols such as 2-propanol and 2-butanol; tertiary alcohols such as 2-methyl-2-propanol, and liquid polyhydric alcohols such as glycerin and glycols. Suitable glycols include, for example, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol and 1,3-butylene glycol. Other known organic solvents for plant extraction include acetone, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, 1,4-dioxane, pyridine, dimethylsulfoxide, N,N-dimethyl formamide, acetic acid, diethyl ether and ethyl acetate. Supercritical extraction can also be used in the preparation of an extract of the present invention. It uses CO2 as a solvent. Under pressure at a temperature below 40° C, CO2 is in its supercritical state, i.e., liquid. It gains the quality of a solvent with the fluidity of a gas. Generally, the CO2 extraction equipment is composed of a CO2 working tank filled with liquid CO2 at ambient temperature, a pump for increasing pressure and driving the circulation, an extractor which contains the powdered raw material, an expansion valve and a separator for collecting the extract. In addition, there are different heat exchangers for adjusting the temperature conditions of the circulating gas. Under supercritical conditions established in the extractor, CO2 has solvent properties for lipophilic ingredients (e.g., gingerols and shogaols in ginger) whereas CO2 is in the gas phase without solvent power under the conditions in the separator (e.g., 60 bar, 30° C). Thus, the extract is precipitated and the gas is regenerated. The CO2 is then liquefied by cooling and given back into the working tank which completes the CO2 cycle. A variety of conditions can be employed for the extraction process. Typically, the extraction procedures are conducted over a period of time between about 10 minutes and about 72 hours at a temperature between about 4° C and about 50° C. However, temperatures between about 4° C and about 90-100° C, for example between about 4° C and about 70° C, can be employed. Similarly, the extraction time may be varied depending on other extraction conditions, such as the solvent and temperature employed; for example, the extraction time can range from several minutes to several days. Determination of appropriate extraction temperatures and times is within the ordinary skills of a worker in the art. Adequate contact between the solvent and the plant material can be encouraged by shaking the suspension. Alternatively, an extraction device equipped with, for instance, a stirring machine, can be employed, which may improve the extraction efficiency. The extraction can be carried out at under atmospheric pressure, under pressure (i.e., above atmospheric pressure) or at reduced pressure (below atmospheric pressure) established by, for example, aspiration (vacuum). Appropriate extraction conditions can readily be determined or selected by one skilled in the art taking into consideration the production conditions such as production facilities and yields. The present invention contemplates that the extraction process may be carried out on various scales including known large, medium and small-scale methods of preparing extracts. Following the extraction process, the liquid fraction (the extract) can be separated from the solid (insoluble) matter. Separation of the liquid and solid fractions can be achieved by one or more standard separation processes known to those skilled in the art, such as various centrifugation or filtration processes. In one embodiment of the invention, the extract is separated from solid matter after the extraction by one or more filtration steps. In another embodiment, the extract is separated from solid matter after the extraction by a series of filtration steps. In an embodiment, the ginger CO2 extract is an essential oil obtained by CO2 extraction (also known as supercritical extraction or supercritical fluid CO2 extraction) using organic ginger (rhizome or underground part of Zingiber offcinale Roscoe). In a specific embodiment, the ginger CO2 extract comprised in the combination of the present invention is obtained from very well documented plant material and is standardized for its general chemical fingerprint including the identification of specific marker compounds (gingerols and shogaols). In an embodiment, the type of ginger extract comprised in the combination of the present invention is 20-25 times concentrated in pungent compounds (Shogaols and gingerols) compared to the original plant material. An example of such an extract is from Flavex (Germany). In an embodiment, the goldenrod extract is a dried concentrated extract obtained by extraction with a mix of water and alcohol of between about 20% and about 85% (e.g., 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85%) alcohol:water. In an embodiment, the goldenrod extract is a dried 5-7:1 concentrated extract obtained by extraction with a mix of 70% water and 30% alcohol. In a particular embodiment, the alcohol is ethanol. In an embodiment, it contains 90% of the native extract and 10% of precipitated silica DAB (Deutsche Arzneibuch). In a specific embodiment, the goldenrod extract comprised in the combination of the present invention is a commercial extract obtained from very well documented plant material standardized for its general chemical fingerprint including the identification of specific marker compounds (flavonoids, available for example from Finzelberg (Germany)).

Without being so limited, they include benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, benzyl alcohol, butylparaben, chlorobutanol, chlorocresol, cresol, ethylparaben, methylparaben, myristyl gamma-picolinium chloride, phenol, phenoxyethanol, phenylmercuric acetate, phenylmercuric nitrate, propylparaben and thimerosal (see Nema, 1997). The term "solvent" as used herein is meant to refer to ingredients capable of facilitating the solubilization of an active ingredient within the formulation. Without being so limited, it includes water, water-alcohol solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered medical parenteral vehicles including sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose solution, dextrose plus sodium chloride solution, Ringer's solution containing lactose, or fixed oils. Intravenous vehicles may include fluid and nutrient replenishers, electrolyte replenishers, such as those based upon Ringer's dextrose, and the like. The oral formulation can be administered in the form of granules, powder, capsules, pills, tablets, film-coated tablets, sugar-coated tablets, syrups, emulsions, suspensions, dispersions, aerosols, solutions, lozenges and/or liquids. In an embodiment, the composition of the present invention is formulated in the form of a capsule. It can also be administered as suppositories, vaginal suppositories, and/or parenterally, e.g., in the form of solutions, emulsions, creams or suspensions. It can be administered in preparation for time delayed release, or protected from gastric acid by coating in order to be released in the intestinal part of the gut. Capsules can contain the composition as a single constituent or mixed with a solid diluent such as calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin. The composition according to the invention can be formulated as liquid, pasty or solid preparations, for example as aqueous or alcoholic solutions, aqueous suspensions or emulsions. Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use are prepared by dissolving the active compound(s)/composition(s) in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other well-known suspending agents. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are alcohol, benzyl benzoate, butyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, N,N dimethylacetamide, ethyl oleate, oleyl oleate, glyceryl trioleate, glyceryl dioleate, glyceryl monooleate, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, capric acid, undecenoic acid, undecanoic acid, lauric acid, oleic acid, synthetic glycerides of saturated fatty acids with 8 to 12 carbon atoms, polyoxyethylene derivatives of glycerol, beeswax, glycerine, mineral oil, vegetable oil such as but not limited to corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, canola oil, sesame oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, arachis oil, castor oil, linseed oil, soya bean oil, sunflower seed oil, olive oil, fish liver oil, and any combination thereof (see Nema, 1997).

Lozenge forms can comprise the active ingredient in a flavor, e.g., sucrose, as well as pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia emulsions, gels, and the like containing, in addition to the active ingredient, carriers known in the art. Enteric coatings can further be used on capsules of the present invention to resist prolonged contact with the strongly acidic gastric fluid, but dissolve in the mildly acidic or neutral intestinal environment. Without being so limited, cellulose acetate phthalate, Eudragit™ and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (HPMCP) can be used in enteric coatings of compositions of the present invention. Cellulose acetate phthalate concentrations generally used are 0.5-9.0% of the core weight. The addition of plasticizers improves the water resistance of this coating material, and formulations using such plasticizers are more effective than when cellulose acetate phthalate is used alone. Cellulose acetate phthalate is compatible with many plasticizers, including acetylated monoglyceride; butyl phthalybutyl glycolate; dibutyl tartrate; diethyl phthalate; dimethyl phthalate; ethyl phthalylethyl glycolate; glycerin; propylene glycol; triacetin; triacetin citrate; and tripropionin. It is also used in combination with other coating agents such as ethyl cellulose, in drug controlled-release /time-release preparations. In an embodiment, the compositions comprising the combination of ginger and goldenrod of the present invention can be formulated for administration as foods or dietary supplements using one or more consumable carriers. A "consumable carrier" is herein defined as any food, food ingredient, or food additive or any excipient utilized for tabletting, encapsulation, or other formulation of an active agent for oral administration, whether for human or animal/veterinary use. For dietary supplements, the combination of the present invention can be mixed according to routine methods in the art. Dietary supplements can be prepared in a variety of forms including, but not limited to, liquid, powder or solid pill form. The extract or composition of the present invention can be administered either alone or in combination with other compounds or extracts including where combining compounds or extracts would lead to additive or synergistic effects. The extract and/or composition of the present invention can also be added directly to foods and ingested as part of a normal meal. Various methods are known to those skilled in the art for addition or incorporation of such agents into foods. Dosage Compositions and formulations for use of the present invention are administered in amounts and at a frequency sufficient to prevent and/or treat flu infections and/or ameliorate any symptoms associated with flu. Any amount of a composition of the present invention can be administered to a subject, provided it is not associated with important adverse effects and it is in a non-toxic dose. The dosages may depend on many factors including the mode of administration, the age and sex of the subject. Other factors, such as the general health and condition of the subject as well as medications currently taken by the subject may modify the dosage of the compositions of the present invention. Typically, the amount of goldenrod and ginger (or their extracts) contained within a single dose will be an amount that effectively prevents or treats a flu infection and one or more associated symptoms, without inducing significant toxicity, i.e., the composition improves or reduces one or more of : viral titers in the subject's blood or cells, runny nose, plugged nose/nasal congestion, sneezing, sore throat, scratchy throat, cough, hoarseness, head congestion, chest congestion, general weakness, fever, muscle pain, loss of appetite, headache and chills. Generally, the effective dose will not exceed CA, US and EP pharmacopeia for each product individually. Thus, in one aspect of the present invention, the composition (food supplement or food stuff) comprising ginger and goldenrod or extracts thereof is administered prior to the onset of flu symptoms as a preventive measure. In another aspect of the present invention, the pharmaceutical or nutraceutical or dietary composition of the present invention is administered in combination with a drug or drugs used to treat flu symptoms. In a further aspect, the composition of the present invention is administered once the subject has been diagnosed with a flu infection or after the onset of flu symptoms. In another embodiment, the composition of the present invention is administered in combination with one or more other drugs used for the prevention and/or treatment of flu infections such as Cold Fx™, Tamiflu™, Echinacea, ginseng, amantadine, rimantadine, Vitamin C, etc. As used herein the expression "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" is meant to refer to an amount effective to achieve the desired therapeutic effect such as an improvement of the condition of the patient, while avoiding adverse side effects,. An effective amount can be administered in one or more doses. For the purposes of this invention, an effective amount of the composition of the present invention is an amount that induces a therapeutic or prophylactic response against flu infections. Such amount may vary according to the nature of the infection (specific type of viral infection), the severity of the infection, the mode of administration, the age, weight and sex of the affected subject, etc. One skilled in the art can easily and without difficulty determine such an effective amount. Generally, the effective amount will be between about 40 mg and about 4500 mg of ginger of ginger (e.g., CO2 extract) and about 200 mg and about 800 mg of goldenrod (e.g., hydroalcoholic extract). In an embodiment, the effective amount is between about 43.5 mg and about 174 mg of ginger CO2 extract and between about 200 mg and about 400 mg of goldenrod hydroalcoholic extract. In another embodiment, the above-mentioned composition comprises between about 1000 mg and about 4500 mg of ginger powder and between about 200 mg and about 800 mg of goldenrod alcoholic extract. In an embodiment, the above-mentioned composition comprises between about 2000 mg and about 4000 mg of ginger powder and between about 400 mg and about 800 mg of goldenrod alcoholic extract. In a related aspect of the present invention, the ratio between the amount of ginger and goldenrod is adjusted so as to obtain an antiviral synergistic effect (i.e., an effect on the inhibition of viral infection that is greater than the sum of the effects observed with ginger and goldenrod when administered alone). The ratio will be adapted depending on the type of extract that is used. In an embodiment, the ratio between ginger powder and goldenrod alcoholic extract is between about 10:1 and about 5:3 (e.g., 8:1, 7:1, 6:1, 5:1, 5:2, etc.) of ginger powder:goldenrod alcoholic extract. Preferably, the ratio is about 5:1 of ginger powder:goldenrod alcoholic extract. In another embodiment, the ratio between ginger CO2 extract and goldenrod alcoholic extract is between about 1:15 and about 3:5 (e.g., 1:10, 1:8, 1:7, 1:6, 1:5:, 2:5, etc.) of ginger CO2 extract:goldenrod alcoholic extract. Preferably, the ratio is about 1:5 of ginger CO2 extract:goldenrod alcoholic extract. The effective amount may be given daily in a single or several doses (e.g., single daily dose, twice daily, three times per day or 4 times per day). It may also be given every 2 days, every 3 days or once a week, as prescribed. Preferably, the effective amount is given twice daily. The effective amount to be administered to a human subject may be calculated from studies in animals. The dose may be scaled up to a human equivalent dose (HED) for starting clinical trials using published conversion tables which provide a conversion factor from mice to human. These are simply guidelines since the actual dose must be carefully selected and titrated by the attending physician based upon clinical factors unique to each patient. The optimal daily dose will be determined by methods known in the art and will be influenced by factors such as the age of the patient as indicated above and other clinically relevant factors. The present invention is illustrated in further details by the following non-limiting examples. Example 1 In vitro synergistic antiviral activity of a combination comprising ginger and goldenrod extracts against influenza virus infection Applicants have demonstrated that ginger and goldenrod extracts alone, as well as their combination, show antiviral activity in a cellular model recognized as a standard way to analyze antiviral activity of therapeutic products (Hayden F, 1980). This model uses a monolayer MDCK (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney) cell line that is infected with an influenza virus (Influenza A/WS/33, H1N1), resulting in lysis plaques (infected cells area) that are then counted. In this analytical model, in presence of antiviral agents, the number of lysis plaques is decreased proportionally to the antiviral power of the tested agents. Monolayers of MDCK cells (ATCC# CCL-34) were grown in 6-well culture plates until confluency. Before the infection or inoculation, the media was removed and cells were washed delicately twice with pre-warmed DMEM without any additives. 200 µl of product (goldenrod (Solidago virgaurea) ETOH Hydroalcoholic extract from Finzelberg, product No. 0193305 and/or ginger (Zingiber officinale) CO2 extract from Flavex product code 0.14.013) were added at proper dilution in DMEM with TPCK (Trypsin treated with L-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone to reduce chymotrypsin activity without affecting trypsin activity) 2 µg/ml. Cells were infected with the human influenza virus A/WS/33 (ATCC #VR-1520), H1N1, diluted in serum-free DMEM with TPCK in 200 µl. The plates were incubated for an hour at room temperature. After adsorption, the cells were overlaid with 3 ml of a 0.6% agarose in pre-defined media containing the product and TPCK 2 µg/ml. Vehicle was used as control. All assays were done in duplicate. Once overlaid the plates were incubated at 37° C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere for 48-72 hours. After the incubation, the plates were stained with Neutral Red. All wells were digitally photographed and plaques were counted and the plaque inhibition for each dilution of product was calculated. The inhibition is reported as percentage (%) of inhibition of infection as compared with infection in the absence of a product. Percentage inhibition was calculated according to the formula: Percentage%⁢inhibition=CA-CB/CAx100 wherein CA is the number of plaques in the absence of a product or plant extract and CB is the count of plaques in the presence of the extract. The goldenrod extract was shown to inhibit the influenza viral infection by 50% at a concentration of 0.04 mg/ml according to the curve obtained with data (not shown) . The ginger CO2 extract was shown to inhibit the viral infection at concentrations higher than 0.05 mg/ml according to the curve obtained with data (not shown) , and the mix 5/1 (golden rod/g inger CO2) was shown to inhibit the viral infection by 68% at a concentration of 0.013/0.003 mg/ml. These results clearly reflect the synergic effect of the goldenrod and ginger CO2 extracts when mixed together in a ratio of 5/1 (goldenrod:ginger, see also Figure 1). Similar results were obtained using ginger powder (dried and grinded whole ginger root) instead of ginger CO2 extract (Figure 2). The ratio of goldenrod:ginger powder was 1:5 for the experiments presented in Figure 2. The results were compared with Tamiflu™ and Cold-Fx™ (data not shown). At a concentration of 1 mg/ml of Cold FX™ no inhibition was observed while 0.05 mg/ml of Tamiflu™ inhibited the formation of lysis plaques by 52%. Both products were therefore less efficient at reducing viral infection than the combination of goldenrod and ginger extracts of the present invention. Example 2 In vivo antiviral activity of goldenrod extract and ginger powder against influenza virus infection An animal model has allowed the Applicants to demonstrate that, when combined, the ginger powder and goldenrod extract also have the in vivo potential to interfere with the infection capability of influenza. In the animal model used, the ginger plant extract (whole ginger root powder) and the goldenrod dry hydroalcoholic extract (from Finzelberg, Germany) were combined in order to show a more significant activity. Animal non-toxic doses of ginger powder, goldenrod extract and a combination thereof have been previously confirmed by the Applicants through in vivo toxicity assays (data not shown). Ginger, goldenrod and a combination thereof were assayed in a recognized animal model related to the prevention and treatment of the influenza virus (Cottey R, 2001). In this study, the ginger was assayed as a dry plant (rhizome) of a CO2 extract. However, the relative quantity of the ginger dry plant used was equivalent to the ginger CO2 extract used in Example 1 (equivalent to the dry starting material). The ginger/goldenrod combination that was used also comprised blueberry dry powder. This formulation is named the Nutracan™ formulation and is described in Table II below. TABLE II: Formulation of Nutracan™Medicinal ingredientRelative Quantity (%) w/wGinger powder (from Martin Bauer, Italy, product No. 3-992)41Goldenrod extract (from Finzelberg, product No. 0193305)8Blueberry powder (from Fruit d'or)20Non-medicinal ingredientAlcolec FF-100 powdered lecithin (from AMERICAN LECITHIN COMPANY)31 In this model, CD-1 mice (10 females per group) were inoculated intranasally with the influenza strain A/WS/33 (H1N1) at 1X103 PFU as determined in a preliminary study (data not shown). Groups were treated either 5 days prior to the infection (preventive arm) or the day of the infection (therapeutic/curative arm) with ginger powder (125 mg/kg), goldenrod extract (25 mg/kg) or a combination thereof (350 mg/kg of Nutracan™). Ginger powder, goldenrod extract and a combination thereof were compared to Tamiflu™ (Oseltamivir phosphate, from Roche, at 10 mg/kg, for therapeutic/curative arm) and to Cold-Fx® (CVT-E002, a ginseng-derived enriched fraction sold in Canada as a NHP for the prevention/attenuation of cold and flu symptoms, from CV Technologies, at 20 mg/kg, for the preventive arm). All these products were administered orally. 1) Seven groups of CD1 mice were randomized based on their weight (n=10). See Table III below for the description of each group, dosage regimen and duration of treatment for each, 2) Mice in the preventive arm groups were force-fed orally with a single daily dose of 100 µl of product for 5 days prior to infection, 3) On the day of infection (day 0), all mice were force-fed 4 hours prior to infection. All mice were then inoculated intranasally with the influenza virus strain A/WS/33, 103 PFU contained in 30 µl of PBS. This was done under light anaesthesia of isofuran, 4) A single daily dose was given for all seven groups (4 preventive, 2 treatments and one control) till the end of the study, e.g., for 8 days, and 5) Apparent symptoms and weight were noted each day. Mice were sacrificed when their general state (including abnormal behaviour, determined by a veterinarian) had deteriorated or they had lost more than 20% of their weight.

All groups presented an increase in MDD when compared to the control group (MDD = 5.7). In the preventive arm of the study, the combination of goldenrod and ginger (Nutracan™ formulation) was the group with the highest increase in MDD. Cold-Fx®, an NHP for the prevention and relief of cold and flu symptoms, was the lowest, although with a significant difference. In the curative arm, Tamiflu® was the most effective, but the difference between the vehicle group and the combination, (Nutracan™ formulation), was still statistically significant. It must be noted that there was a statistical difference between each group (preventive or curative) and the control group (p<0.002 or less). No mice of the control group survived after 6 days of the experiment, whereas the groups with treatment had different survival rates. Table IV below summarizes the MDD value and provides statistical value for each group in the study. All groups had a significant value when compared to the control group without treatment.

The percentage of weight loss is represented in Figure 4. The first 5 days prior to infection are not in the graph since there was no significant weight difference between groups. It is important to note that the difference is lower in the end since the mice remaining are those that survived the experiment. Example 3 (Reference Example) Antiviral activity of goldenrod and ginger extracts against cold infections The antiviral activity of ginger (CO2 extract, from Flavex, product no. 0.14.013) and goldenrod (Solidago virgaurea, Hydroalcoholic extract, Finzelberg product no. 0193305) was assessed against human cold infections As shown in Table V below and Figure 5, both goldenrod and ginger extracts (alone or in combination) inhibit rhinovirus infection, although goldenrod appears to be more efficient than ginger at the concentrations tested. The antiviral activity was determined using a cellular model recognized as a standard way to analyze plaque formation by rhinovirus (Fiala M, 1968). This model uses a monolayer of HeLa cell line that is infected with a human rhinovirus, resulting in lysis plaques (infected cells area) that are then counted. In this analytical model, in presence of antiviral agents, the numbers of lysis plaques is decreased proportionally to the antiviral power of the tested agents. Monolayers of HeLa cells (ATCC# CCL-2) were grown in 6-well culture plates until confluency. Before the infection or inoculation, the media was removed and cells were washed delicately once with pre-warmed DMEM supplemented with 30 mM of MgCl2 and 2% fetal bovine serum. 200 µl of the tested product (goldenrod and/or ginger extract) were added at proper dilution in DMEM with 30 mM of MgCl2 and 2% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then infected with the human rhinovirus 1A (ATCC #VR-1559), diluted in 200 µl of the same medium as the tested extracts. The plates were incubated for an hour at 33°C, 5% CO2. After adsorption, the product and virus solution were removed and the cells were overlaid with 3 ml of a solution containing 1% agarose in pre-defined media containing the product. Vehicle was used as control. All assays were done in duplicate. Once overlaid, the plates were incubated at 33°C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere for 2 days. After the incubation, the plates were stained with Crystal Violet 0.1%. All wells were digitally photographed, plaques were counted and the inhibition of plaque formation for each dilution of product was calculated. The inhibition is reported as percentage (%) of inhibition of infection as compared with infection in the absence of product. Percentage inhibition was calculated according to the formula: Percentage%inhibition=CA-CB/CAx100 wherein CA is the number of plaque in the absence of a product or plant extract and CB is the count of plaque in the presence of the extract or their combination.

The extraction with water was done as follows: 7.5 g of grinded goldenrod was extracted with agitation in 50 ml of water for 24 hours at room temperature, left with no agitation for another 24 hours and then centrifuged for 7 minutes at 1500 rpm. The supernatant was submitted to multiple filtrations, 40 µm, 1.2 µm, 0.45 µm and finally 0.2 µm. Alcoholic extraction was as follows: 15 g of grinded goldenrod were macerated in 100 ml of methanol with a 10-minute reflux. The generated extract was submitted to multiple filtrations, 40 µm, 1.2 µm, and finally 0.2 µm The results presented in Table VI below and Figure 6 show that for Solidago decurense, and Solidago canadensis, the alcoholic extract is much more efficient at inhibiting viral infection than the water extract. Similar results can be observed for Solidago virgaurea, although to a lesser extent. This difference is probably due to the concentrations tested (which are probably too high to clearly show a difference for this particular species). In addition, as observed for the aqueous extraction, among the species tested, Solidago virgaurea appears to be the most efficient at inhibiting viral infection, followed closely by Solidago canadensis and finally Solidago decurense.TABLE VI: Antiviral activity of water and alcoholic extracts from various species of goldenrodPlantConcentration (mg/ml)Inhibition of PFU (%) Aqueous extractionInhibition of PFU (%) Alcoholic extractionSolidago decurense0.1391000.052695Solidago virgaurea0.11001000.0588100Solidago canadensis0.1811000.0572100 Example 5 Antiviral activity of goldenrod and ginger extracts on the human Pandemic H1N1/09 influenza virus (Swine flu virus) The antiviral activity of goldenrod (Solidago virgaurea) and ginger extracts (alone and/or in combination) against Swine flu was tested and compared to that of Ribavarin and Oseltamivir. The Antiviral and Toxicity Assays have been validated (Noah et Al., Antiviral Res. 2007 Jan; 73(1):50-9). MATERIALS AND METHODS CellTiter-Glo® Detection Assay for Cell viability Measurement of influenza-induced CPE is based on quantitation of ATP, an indicator of metabolically active cells. The CPE assay employs a commercially available CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and is a reliable method for determining cytotoxicity and cell proliferation in culture. The procedure involves adding the single reagent (CellTiter-Glo® Reagent) directly to previously cultured, subconfluent cells in media. This induces cell lysis and the production of a bioluminescent signal (half-life greater than 5 hours, depending on the cell type) that is proportional to the amount of ATP present (which is a biomarker for viability).

Afterward, the cells were diluted in BSA-containing DMEM, aliquoted into 96-well plates, and allowed to attach to the plate for 18 hours at 37° C. On day 2, a visual observation confirmed cell viability. Test compounds (ginger CO2, alcoholic goldenrod extract, and 5:1 goldenrod/ginger CO2) were diluted to the appropriate test concentrations in BSA-containing media and were added to virus 2 hours before inoculation in 3 replicates. After the 2 hours, the compound with virus solutions were added to each CPE and the compounds with no virus was added to toxicity test wells. Plates were prepared as follows: 1) Untreated (media, negative control); 2) Treated with final concentrations of 0.01, 0.04, 0.12, 0.37, 1.1, 3.3, 10, 30 µg of ginger CO2 (1:3 serial dilution, 3.3 log range, 8 doses); or 3) Treated with final concentrations of 0.07, 0.214, 0.62, 1.85, 5.56, 16.67, 50, 150 µg of goldenrod extract; or 4) Treated with final concentrations of 0.014/0.07, 0.04/0.214, 0.12/0.62, 0.37/1.85, 1.1/5.56, 3.3/16.67, 10/50, 30/150 µg of ginger CO2/goldenrod extract 1/5; 5) Treated with final concentrations of 0.016, 0.033, 0.10, 0.33, 1.04, 3.3, 10.4, 33 µM of Oseltamivir ; or 6) Treated with final concentrations of 0.046, 0.14, 0.4, 1.2, 3.7, 11.1, 33.3, 100 µM ribavirin in <1% DMSO. Final well volume was 100 µl (50 µl cells + 25 µl drug 4X (or media) + 25 µl virus 4X (or media)). The control virus was also incubated for 2 hours in media prior to inoculation. Each conditions were added to the wells 1) virus (triplicates) - for antiviral efficacy (CPE) analysis; and 2) No virus (duplicates) - for toxicity analysis. Virus was added at 100 TCID50 (100 times the tissue culture infectious dose that causes 50% lethality in 72h, final concentration in the well is 1X)). On Day 5 (72 h post virus addition), cell viability was measured by luminescence analysis using Promega CellTiter-Glo® kit. Data reporting The raw data was then analyzed and compiled to provide: 1) Raw data and dose response curves for each treatment and virus strain; 2) Inhibitory concentration; IC50, IC90; 3) Raw data and toxicity profile for each treatment and virus strain; 4) Toxic concentration; TC50 and TC90; and 5) Therapeutic indices for each treatment and virus strain (see Table VIII below).

The ginger CO2 extract was shown to inhibit the same viral infection at a concentration of 0.02 µg/ml, and the mix (goldenrod/ginger CO2) was shown to inhibit the viral infection by 50% at a concentration of 0.04:0.07 µg/ml. These results demonstrate a strong effect of goldenrod extract and ginger CO2 extracts taken individually or mixed in a ratio of 5/1 (goldenrod:ginger, Figure 7A-C). The results were compared with Tamiflu™ and Ribavarin™. Both products were less efficient at reducing Swine flu infection than the combination of goldenrod and ginger extracts and individual extracts of the present invention. The highest cell viability observed when the compounds were tested individually is 99% at 0.21 µg/ml for PL208 and 101% at 0.37 µg/ml for PL202. The combination of the two compounds at these concentrations resulted in a cell viability of 120%, suggesting that the compounds have no cytotoxicity at these concentrations and are able to promote cell growth and prevent virus-induced cell death. It is clear from the data that this is the optimal concentration combination for the drugs. While synergy cannot be accurately determined because the cell viability values for the drugs used individually at these concentrations are at or above 100%, it does suggest some synergistic effect. Example 6 Administration of ginger and goldenrod extracts within 48 hours of the onset on symptoms improves treatment of cold and flu infections Applicants have observed in anecdotic cases of human subjects who received ginger and goldenrod extracts, that administration of the Nutracan™ formulation (comprising ginger (powder) and Solidago virgaurea (Hydroalcoholic) extract -see Table 2 above) within 48 hours of the onset of cold and flu symptoms greatly increased the success of treatment. The composition of the present invention may thus advantageously be administered within 48 hours of the onset of the symptoms or as a preventive treatment (i.e., before the onset of the symptoms). This Example is not part of the invention insofar as it concerns the treatment of cold infections. Example 7 Exemplary oral formulation comprising a goldenrod hydroalcoholic extract and a ginger CO2 extract The following oral caplet formulation was prepared for the clinical assessment of the efficacy of the combination of the present invention. The formulation was a 450 mg capsule for oral administration.

In a more specific embodiment, 60ml of flavored juice contains a ratio of 0.5g of ginger powder with 0.3g of goldenrod extract. Example 9 (Reference Example) Clinical study The purpose of the clinical Study (No. BDI-URS-09-002): a double blind study using Echinacea capsules as the reference product) is to evaluate the safety and the preliminary clinical efficacy of the combination of the present invention (named BDI-630 in the clinical study protocol) in reducing the severity and duration of the symptoms associated with colds. The general approach to be followed during the double-blinded study is to compare the effect of a well-recognized NHP for the attenuation of cold symptoms, Echinacea ( Echinamide™ - echinacae purpurea extract plant: extract ratio of 2.4:1), to the combination of the present invention in Community-dwelling Adults (between 21 and 60 years old). Following is a summary of the clinical protocol that will be used. Trial Objectives The objective of this pilot/exploratory clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of a specific formulation comprising a CO2 supercritical extract obtained from ginger (Zingiber officinale) and a hydro-alcoholic extract obtained from goldenrod (Solidago virgaurea L.) as described in Example 7 (Table IX) versus Echinamide® (Echinacea purpurea) on the management (attenuation) of cold symptoms in community-dwelling adults (between 18 and 60 years old). Study Design and Duration Study BDI-URS-09-002 will be an exploratory, double-blinded, randomized, and controlled study, performed at centers in Quebec, Canada during the winter season. Patients who have developed cold symptoms (within the last 36 hours) and have signed an Informed Consent Form (ICF) will be screened to assess their eligibility according to the inclusion & exclusion criteria. Approximately 80 patients with clinically confirmed cold symptoms (defined below) as evaluated by a physician, will be randomized in order to obtain a minimum of 72 evaluable patients following the 10 day-treatment period (i.e., an approximate dropout rate of 10% is expected). Patients will be randomly allocated BDI-630 or Echinamide®. Randomized patients will start taking the Investigational Product on Day 1 (Screening and Randomization Visit) and will continue for a total of 10 days. Evaluation Visits will take place on Day 7 and Day 14. Patients will be monitored for safety assessments and for cold symptoms evaluations for up to 14 days. During the 14-day study, patients will be asked to complete the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey - 21 (WURSS-21) and a diary (to register daily adverse events, concomitant medications, daily doses of the Investigational Product). Patients will contact the Investigator if they experience Serious Adverse Events and an unscheduled (urgent) visit will be arranged for appropriate diagnosis and treatment, as determined by the Physician. A clinically confirmed cold in this study is defined as follows: the patient reports at least 2 of the following symptoms (within the last 36 hours): runny nose, stuffy/plugged nose, sneezing, sore throat, scratchy throat, cough, hoarseness, head congestion, chest congestion and feeling tired/exhausted. The duration of treatment with BDI-630 or Echinamide® for each patient is 10 days. The total duration of the study for each patient is 14 Days. Patient visits are as follows: Day 1 (Screening and Randomization), Day 7 (Treatment Evaluation) and Day 14 (Post-Treatment Follow-up). Sample Size It is expected that at least 120 patients will be screened to randomize 80 eligible patients (40 patients on BDI-630 and 40 patients on Echinamide®) and that approximately 72 will complete this 14 day study, as an estimated 10% may drop-out during the study.

Drug Formulation BDI-630 is a combination of two medicinal ingredients: Ginger (Zingiberofficinale) root CO2 extract and Goldenrod (Solidago virgaurea) aerial part hydroalcoholic extract. Each BDI-630 capsule contains 450 mg of the mixture + excipients (see Example 7 for detailed formulation). Echinamide®: commercial product containing 250 mg of Echinacea purpurea per capsule. Capsules of Echinamide® will be inserted in identical white opaque capsules and packaged in the same plastic bottle used for BDI-630 to ensure blindness. Dosage Regimen From Day 1 to Day 7: A) BDI-630: 4 capsules / day (2 capsules, twice a day); 1,800 mg total daily dose; or B) Echinamide®: 4 capsules / day (2 capsules, twice a day); 1,000 mg total daily dose. Supplies will be shipped to the Investigational site in equal proportions and the labels will have a number (associated with a blinded randomization code) but the site personnel will not know the code. The treatment products (BDI-630 or Echinamide®) will be supplied in bottles, each containing a 10-day supply. The bottles will be dispensed to the patient on Day 1 and the empty container will be returned on Day 14 to determine compliance and perform supply reconciliation. After symptoms confirmation and randomization, BDI-630 or Echinamide® must be taken daily for 10 days. Evaluation visits will be as described in Table XIV below: TABLE XIV: Treatment / Assessment VisitsProceduresDay 1 Screening1Day 1 Start of TreatmentDay 7 Treatment EvaluationDay 14 Follow-up EvaluationUnscheduled visit2Randomization×Clinical laboratory (Haematology3, Clinical Chemistry3 , Urinalysis3 , Coagulation test3, blood serum4)××××Dispensing prevention dose (10-day-product supply)7×Patient diary completion5××××Concomitant medications (post-randomization)××××AEs or SAEs××××Physical examinations (post-randomization)×××WURSS-21 Questionnaire for assessing severity of respiratory symptoms and QOL6×××Return of bottles /blisters, assessment of compliance× Screening and Day 1 will be combined in one visit.

They will be kept frozen (at -70 degrees Celsius) until tests are performed; 5 Patient will keep a diary as of Day 1 and will record data daily for 14 days. They will bring the diary at visits Day 7 and Day 14; 6 The first WURSS-21 Questionnaire will be completed by the patients during the Day 1 visit, before the Physical exam and Investigator interview. The WURSS-21 Questionnaire must then be completed daily by the patients and could be completed prior to or during the Day 7 and Day 14 visits;7 The first dose should be administered at the Investigational site and patients should be kept under observation for 30 minutes (in case of an allergic reaction, to ensure appropriate treatment). Concomitant Medication Prohibited medication/therapies: (1)Treatment with any other investigational drugs; or (2) the use of the following drugs throughout the entire study: immunomodulators (i.e., Interleukins, Interferon); systemic corticosteroids (i.e., systemic Cortisone, Dexamethasone and/or other immunosuppressive medications, i.e., Imuran); anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, heparin, Aspirin®, Clopidogrel®); anti-inflammatory, antiviral, nasal decongestants containing corticosteroids or antihistamines; expectorants, lozenges, zinc, oral antihistamines, antibiotics, cough syrup; sleep medication (e.g., sleeping pills, caffeine pills); herbal supplements intended for the treatment of colds (including herbal tea), Cold Fx®, Airborn®, Echinilin®, ginseng; vitamin C (multivitamins containing <100mg vitamin C are allowed). Allowed concomitant medications: Antipyretics (for patients with fever), i.e., acetaminophen (Tylenol®) and ibuprofen (Motrin® or Advil®); and nasal saline spray. Premature Withdrawal / Discontinuation Criteria At any time, a patient may be withdrawn from the study at his/her own request or on the basis of the Investigator's clinical judgment. However, patients who request to be withdrawn will be strongly encouraged to complete appropriate examinations for a valid evaluation of their case for its incorporation into the analysis. A patient who has not been randomized will be considered as "screening failure". A patient who experiences an immediate hypersensitivity reaction (attributed to the treatment product) will be withdrawn from the study. Such reaction is defined as a systemic allergic reaction of immediate onset (within 1 hour post-dose) i) associated with hypotension or syncope; or ii) involving two or more organ systems. The Investigator should also provide in the Case Report Form (CRF) and source documentation a brief comment regarding the reason(s) and circumstances for withdrawal especially if a stop of treatment was not related to "lack of efficacy" or to "lack of tolerability". A patient, who has been withdrawn with or due to an adverse effect and which has not been resolved at the time of withdrawal, should be followed up as clinically indicated. Efficacy Variables and Analysis The following efficacy endpoints will be evaluated: (a) The change in severity of common cold symptoms in total severity score (i.e., runny nose, plugged nose, sneezing, sore throat, scratchy throat, cough, hoarseness, head congestion, chest congestion, feeling tired) as compiled in the WURSS-21 questionnaires between Days 1 and 14; (b) The area under the curve (AUC) of the total severity score (i.e., runny nose, plugged nose, sneezing, sore throat, scratchy throat, cough, hoarseness, head congestion, chest congestion, feeling tired) based on the data compiled in the WURSS-21 questionnaires between Days1 and 14; (c) The number of days with at least one WURSS-21 symptom with a score of 5 (moderate) or more (i.e., runny nose, plugged nose, sneezing, sore throat, scratchy throat, cough, hoarseness, head congestion, chest congestion, feeling tired) between Days 1 and 14; (d) Health-related quality of life measured by the quality of life (QOL) questions (i.e., think clearly; sleep well; breathe easily; walk, climb stairs, exercise; accomplish daily activities; work outside the home; work inside the home; interact with others; live your personal life) in the WURSS-21 Questionnaires compiled between Days 1 and 14; (e) Frequency, type and intensity of therapies and medication used against common cold from Days 1 to 14; and (f) the level of cytokines in blood serum. Safety Variables and Analysis Safety will be evaluated on the basis of treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory measurements (clinical chemistry, cytokine levels, haematology, and urinalysis), and concomitant medications. The number and percentage of patients experiencing AEs and SAEs by type, frequency and intensity will be evaluated. Statistical Analysis The following populations will be analyzed in this study: (A) Safety population: Patients eligible for analysis will have received a minimum of one dose of the Investigational Product; and (B) Intent-to-treat population: Patients eligible for analysis are patients who have received a minimum of one dose of the Investigational Product and that were randomized, as classified by the arm to which the patient is randomized. In order to evaluate hypotheses of variables in contingency tables, the Fisher exact test for proportions will be used. Multiple comparisons of time repeated data will be performed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). In addition, descriptive statistics and graphical methods will be used to characterize the data. REFERENCES 1. Altman, Lawrence K. (2006-01-15).
