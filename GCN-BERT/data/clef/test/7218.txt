N-(1-methyl-3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-5'-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-[2,3'-bipyridine]-6-carboxamide (1-38)
An NMP (1 mL) solution of 5'-fluoro-N-(1-methyl-3-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-[2,3'-bipyridine]-6-carboxamide (22.5 mg, 0.06 mmol) and 1-methylpiperazine (0.1 mL) was heated at 120-150Â° C. for 11 days until 50% desired product formed, as monitored by LC-MS. Solvent was removed in vacuo, after silica gel chromatography and further trituration from Hexanes-EtOAc, title compound was obtained as a light tan color solid: 12.4 mg (45% yield);
