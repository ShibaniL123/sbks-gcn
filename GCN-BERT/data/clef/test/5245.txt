TITLE OPTIMAL DOSING OF A CD 19- ANTIBODY DRUG CONJUGATE CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority to, and benefit of, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/976,790, filed April 8, 2014. SEQUENCE LISTING [0002] A sequence listing designated 0019-0041 IPC ST25.txt of 3KB created April 1, 2015, is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0003] This invention relates to optimal dose regimens for treatment of B-linage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL or ALL) using a CD19-antibody drug conjugate. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0004] CD19 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. See, e.g., Tedder & Isaacs, / Immunol, 143:712-717 (1989) and Del Nagro et al., Immunol Res, 31: 119-131 (2005). It is a B cell-specific marker not known to be expressed by any cell outside of the B lineage. CD 19 expression is maintained upon malignant transformation, thus, CD19 is found on malignant cells in the majority of patients with B-cell leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. See, e.g., Nadler et al, J Immunol, 131:244-250 (1983); Anderson et al, Blood, 63: 1424-1433 (1984); and Scheuermann & Racila, Leuk Lymphoma, 18:385-397 (1995). [0005] SGN-CD19A is a CD19-directed antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of three components: 1) the humanized antibody hBU12, specific for human CD 19, 2) the microtubule disrupting agent, monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), and 3) a stable linker, maleimidocaproyl, that covalently attaches MMAF to hBU12. The proposed mechanism of action (MOA) is initiated by SGN-CD19A binding to CD 19 on the cell surface followed by internalization of the ADC. Upon trafficking to lysosomes, the delivered drug (cysmcMMAF) is released through proteolytic degradation of the antibody carrier. Binding of the released drug to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. [0006] SGN-CD19A activity has recently been assessed in a phase 1 clinical trial for treatment of patients with B-linage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The trial is intended to provide information on the safety of the SGN-CD19A molecule in a human patient population. Clinical trials also provide data on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of the SGN-CD19A molecule in treating B-ALL. For best usage of the drug, an optimum dosing regimen would be useful for prescribing physicians. The present invention solves this and other problems.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0033] This invention provides optimized dosage schedules for administration of the SGN- CD19A drug to patients suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Results from an early stage clinical trial indicate that SGN-CD19A exhibits a complex relationship between pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). A model was generated to describe the relationship of SGN-CD19A clearance and its effect on ALL tumor cells. Using the model, SGN-CD19A dosing schedules can be devised to maximize tumor cell cytotoxicity and minimize off target toxicity in the patient. [0034] SGN-CD19A is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) produced by the conjugation of the drug-linker intermediate maleimidocaproyl monomethyl auristatin F (mcMMAF) to the humanized antibody hBU12 (Figure 1). The points of attachment are cysteines produced by reduction of inter-chain disulfides. SGN CD19A has an average of four drugs per antibody molecule. [0035] Methods of making the hBU12 antibody are disclosed, e.g., at US Patent No. 7,968,687. The amino acid sequence of the light chain variable region of hBU12 is provided herein as SEQ ID NO: l. The amino acid sequence of the heavy chain variable region of hBU12 is provided herein as SEQ ID NO:2. hBU12 is an IgGl antibody and the variable regions are joined to human heavy and light constant regions. US Patent No. 7,968,687 also provides methods for the synthesis of mcMMAF and its conjugation to hBU12. [0036] SGN-CD19A, therefore, is an ADC that delivers mcMMAF to CD19-positive cells. mcMMAF is a tubulin-binding molecule. SGN-CD19A has a proposed multi-step mechanism of action initiated by binding to their target on the cell surface and subsequent internalization. After cell surface binding, internalization, and trafficking of SGN-CD19A through the endocytic pathway, proteolytic degradation of hBU12 in the lysosomes releases the cysteine adduct of the drug linker in the form of cys-mcMMAF, which then becomes available for tubulin binding. See, e.g., Doronina et ah, Nat Biotechnol 21:778-84 (2003) and Doronina et al., Bioconjug Chem 17: 114-24 (2006). cys-mcMMAF and mcMMAF are used interchangeably herein. Binding of the released drug to tubulin disrupts the cellular microtubule network, leading to G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and subsequent onset of apoptosis in the targeted cell. [0037] The model described herein is used to optimize dosing of SGN-CD19A for treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ALL is also known as B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and both names are used interchangeably. ALL is a cancer of the white blood cells that is characterized by uncontrolled growth of lymphoblasts or immature white blood cells. Lymphoblasts are also referred to as "blasts", herein. Blasts typically grow in the bone marrow and crowd out normal blood cells. Blasts cells may be seen in blood, but diagnoses is typically done be review of bone marrow biopsy. [0038] Based on the PK and PD values from patients after administration of SGN-CD19A, a model was generated to describe the observed PK and PD data, and subsequently to determine optimal dosage of SGN-CD19A based on CD19 occupancy. See, e.g., Figure 12. According to the model, SGN-CD19A is first administered via intravenous infusion to the central compartment. The central compartment includes plasma, bone marrow, and rapidly perfused tissues. SGN-CD19A is then cleared from the central compartment at the rate of "CL" and may also diffuse to and from the more slowly perfused tissues, peripheral compartment, both through linear kinetics. SGN-CD19A in the central compartment binds to CD19 expressed on cancer cells, e.g., leukemia or lymphoma cells, to form a CD19-SGN-CD19A complex. The complex is internalized into the cancer cells, where the cytotoxin, cys-mcMMAF, is released after catabolism of SGN-CD19A. The intracellular cys-mcMMAF causes cancer cell growth arrest and death in a concentration-dependent manner. It is assumed that the majority of leukemia blast cells resides in bone marrow and replicate at a rate governed by the Gompertz growth law, which is faster at low disease burden and becomes slower with increasing disease burden. It is also assumed that all leukemia blast cells in a given patient have the same CD 19 expression level and the total CD 19 in a patient is determined by the cellular expression level and disease burden at any given time. [0039] Some assumptions underlie the model. First, the distribution kinetics of unbound SGN- CD19A (drug) to tissues is linear and may be described by inter-compartment rate constants. Second, SGN-CD19A is highly specific and does not bind to targets other than CD 19. Third, the drug-CD 19 binding occurs only in the central compartment and not in the peripheral (tissue) compartments. Fourth, the drug-CD 19 binding is a rapid process and results in simple one-to- one drug-target complex. Fifth, the binding of SGN-CD19A to the CD 19 protein results in internalization and degradation of the drug-CD 19 complex, which results in the released of the small molecule cytotoxin (cys-mcMMAF). Sixth, CD 19 synthesis and degradation rates are constant in all blast cells in a given patient and are not affected by the treatment. Seventh, the majority of blast cells reside in bone marrow space. [0040] The model structure is shown in Figure 12. [0041] SGN-CD19A is formulated for patients in a sterile pharmaceutically acceptable excipient and then administered to patients. Typically, administration is by intravenous methods. A preferred pharmaceutically acceptable formulation for SGN-CD19A is 15 mg/ml in 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 0.02% w/v polysorbate 80, and 60 mg/ml sucrose. [0042] The methods of the present invention provide optimized dosing schedules of SGN- CD19A for treatment of ALL. The optimal doses and schedules were determined based on a number of patient disease characteristics, for example, disease burden and CD 19 expression levels. High disease burden in this model was defined as a packed (100% replaced), hypercellular bone marrow as assessed on bone marrow biopsy or aspirate. Low disease burden was defined as 10% of the bone marrow replaced by blasts as assessed on bone marrow biopsy or aspirate. High CD19 expression was defined as a CD19 MFI value of 45 at baseline and low expression was 4.5 at baseline. Another relevant characteristic is the sensitivity (coefficient of 0.00019 on drug effect) or lack of sensitivity (coefficient of 0.00006) of the cancer to an anti- CD^ treatment, such as SGN-CD19A. [0043] SGN-CD19A can be administered to ALL patients on a fixed dose schedule. A fixed dose schedule is a schedule that is unvaried over time. For SGN-CD19A administration on a fixed dose schedule, it is important to maintain the dose intensity, i.e., the amount of SGN- CD19A per unit of patient weight per unit of time, at about 1 mg/kg/week. This dose intensity will be beneficial to patients regardless of their disease burden or sensitivity to treatment. Thus, acceptable fixed dose schedules of SGN-CD19A include 1.6 mg/kg given on days one and eight of a three week cycle, 2.2 mg/kg every two weeks, or 3.0 mg/kg every three weeks. [0044] SGN-CD19A can also be administered to ALL patients using a higher loading dose and/or more frequent loading doses followed by lower and/or less frequent maintenance doses. Typically, the loading dose is greater than the maintenance dose. For patients who have high disease burden and are sensitive to treatment, 2 mg/kg given every three weeks is an acceptable maintenance dose following one cycle of 2 mg/kg given on days one and eight of a three week cycle. Typically a single cycle of loading dose of more frequent dosing is given, but more can be administered, as needed, to decrease disease burden and induce remission before switching to maintenance dose schedule. Thus, one, two three or four loading doses can be given before starting maintenance doses. Maintenance doses are given, e.g., for two-20 three week cycles, at the 2 mg/kg dose level. [0045] For patients who have high disease burden and are less sensitive to treatment, 3 mg/kg given every three weeks is an acceptable maintenance dose following a loading dose of 5 mg/kg given every three weeks. Typically a single loading dose is given, but more can be administered, as needed, to decrease disease burden and induce remission. For some patients, multiple loading doses, e.g., one, two three or four loading doses loading doses can be given before starting maintenance doses. Maintenance doses are given, e.g., for two-20 three week cycles, at the 3 mg/kg dose level. EXAMPLES [0046] The following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to limit the claimed invention. Example 1: Model of SGN-CD19A dosing for treatment of ALL based on a semi-mechanistic PK/PD model. Methods Clinical trial [0047] SGN-CD19A was administered intravenously (IV) on a weekly schedule (first 2 weeks of a 21 -day cycle on Days 1 and 8. Dose levels were escalated. Adult patients were initially enrolled in cohorts of 2, starting with dose level 1. For the first 6 patients, complete dose limiting toxicity information was available before the next patient cohort was enrolled. After the first 6 patients, 3 patients at a time could be enrolled and in the DLT period. Once one patient finished the DLT period, another patient could be enrolled. Estimates of safety were determined by a continuous reassessment model, and an algorithm allocated patients to dose levels. Dose levels are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Dose escalation schedule PK and PD measurements [0048] Plasma SGN-CD19A levels - SGN-CD19A was administered on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle at the indicated dose levels. Blood was drawn from patients at the schedule time for PK and PD measurements (Table 2). The concentrations of plasma SGN-CD19A were determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Briefly, a monoclonal antibody specific to the MMAF portion of the antibody-drug conjugate was used to capture the SGN-CD19A antibody from plasma. Bound SGN-CD19A was detected by a biotin conjugated anti-ID 19A detection antibody followed by addition of a polymer horseradish peroxidase conjugated to streptavidin (poly HRP-SA). For detection TMB (3,3', 5, 5' tetramethylbenzidine) was used which was converted from colorless TMB to a colored TMB derivative. [0049] Unbound CD 19 receptor protein on blasts - Blasts were isolated from cryopreserved patient blood and incubated labeled hBU12 antibody (hBU12-AF488). After incubation the cells were assayed by flow cytometry for its fluorescence intensity expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). [0050] SGN-CD19A bound to blast cells - Blast cells were isolated from patient blood and incubated with a labeled antibody specific for MMAF (SG15.22-AF647). After washing to remove unbound labeled antibody, cells were assayed by flow cytometry for its fluorescence intensity expressed as MFI. Table 2 PK/PD sample collection timepoints a Sample obtained only for patients not continuing on treatment or not starting the next cycle on Day 22. b Cycle 2 only. c This schedule should be followed for retreatment cycle 1 Measurement of disease burden [0051] Patient disease was monitored by bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy at indicated times. A pathologist reviewed bone marrow slides from patients and assessed for percentage of bone marrow cells that were malignant blasts, as well as the total amount of space in the bone marrow that was taken up by cells (cellularity). Disease burden was a product of the cellularity and the percentage of the bone marrow that was replaced by malignant blasts. Results PK in ALL and lymphoma [0052] SGN-CD19A was administered to ALL patients at levels up to 2.0 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle. Plasma levels of SGN-CD19A were measured per protocol-defined schedule (Table 2). Results are shown in Figure 2A. Following iv infusion administration, the levels of plasma SGN-CD19A generally reached Cmax at the end of infusion and decreased in a multiexponential manner. The PK profiles showed a more rapid decline of the SGN-CD19A plasma concentration at lower dose levels, indicating non-linear PK. In contrast, when SGN- CD19A was administered to lymphoma patients the PK profiles are similar among different dose levels, as shown in Figure 2B Semi-mechanistic integrated PK-PD model [0053] A semi-mechanistic integrated PK-PD model was developed based on the mechanism of action of SGN-CD19A and the clinical PK and PD data from the ongoing first- in-human dose- escalation study in adult and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory B cell leukemia or highly aggressive B-cell lymphoma (CT.gov NCT01786096). Plasma SGN-CD19A ADC concentration-time profiles were described by a two-compartment PK model with both linear and nonlinear clearance pathways. The nonlinear clearance was modeled as target- mediated disposition through binding to cell membrane CD19 and internalization of the complex. Antitumor effects in the form of reduced bone marrow disease burden were modeled using a cell-kill PK-PD model driven by the internalized cys-mcMMAF concentrations. Both PK and PD data were fitted simultaneously using NONMEM® version 7.1.2. At low levels of administration, SGN-CD19A exhibited a biphasic PK curve, indicating rapid clearance of the drug. As the dose of SGN-CD19A increased the PK curve became monophasic indicating slower clearance of the drug. SGN-CD19A clearance occurred through two mechanisms: clearance through whole body catabolism and clearance through uptake by tumor cells. Over time SGN-CD19A was taken up by ALL tumor cells, killing the tumor cells and reducing the tumor burden. Thus, over time, the rate of clearance through tumor uptake decreased and less SGN-CD19A was needed to kill tumor cells. Model diagnostics [0054] To determine the goodness of model fit, model-predicted values were compared to values observed from patient samples. Results are shown in figures 3A-3D. In Figure 3A observed plasma SGN-CD19A concentrations were plotted against the predicted values from the model. Linear regression analysis was performed and compared to a unity line. In Figure 3B levels of observed unbound CD 19 MFI on blast cells were plotted against the predicted values from the model. Linear regression analysis was performed and compared to a unity line. In Figure 3C levels of observed MAFI for SGN-CD19A bound to blast cells were plotted against the predicted values from the model. Linear regression analysis was performed and compared to a unity line. In Figure 3D levels of observed percent blast cells in bone marrow were plotted against the predicted values from the model. Linear regression analysis was performed and compared to a unity line. For all of the comparisons, the linear regression and unity lines were nearly identical, indicating that the observed and predicted values were similar and the model described the observed data well . [0055] Figures 4A-4D show observed and predicted values for a single ALL patient over a period of time. In all graphs, 0.3 mg/kg SGN-CD19A was administered on days 1 and 8 of cycles 1-4; 1.0 mg/kg SGN-CD19A was administered on days 1 and 8 of cycles 5-8; and 1.3 mg/kg was administered on days 1 and 8 of cycle 9. In Figure 4A observed plasma SGN- CD19A (ADC) concentrations were plotted against time and then overlaid with the predicted values from the model. In Figure 4B levels of observed unbound CD 19 MFI on blast cells were plotted against time and then overlaid with the predicted values from the model. In Figure 4C levels of observed MFI for SGN-CD19A bound to blast cells were plotted against time and then overlaid with the predicted values from the model. In Figure 4D levels of observed percent blast cells in bone marrow were plotted against time and then overlaid with the predicted values from the model. For all of these comparisons, the pattern predicted by the model matched the observed values in patient samples well. Simulation of CO 19 occupancy based on model [0056] Model simulations were conducted for alternative doses and schedules, including more frequent dose or loading dose regimens followed by maintenance dose regimens, and for ALL patients with different baseline disease characteristics. [0057] The first simulation was for an ALL patient with high baseline CD19 expression and 100% bone marrow blasts and hypercellularity in bone marrow. SGN-CD19A was administered on a fixed dosage schedules: 1.6 mg/kg on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle; 2.2 mg/kg every two weeks; or 3 mg/kg every three weeks. The model was used to predict the percentage of CD 19 on blast cells that were bound to SGN-CD19A (CD19 occupancy). High target saturation was assumed to occur if 90% of the CD 19 proteins on blasts were occupied. Figure 5 A provides the results for cancer that is sensitive to treatment, while Figure 5B provides the results for a cancer that is insensitive to treatment. Simulation results suggest that at dose intensity of ~1 mg/kg/week, all dosing schedules appear to achieve high and comparable target occupancy by SGN-CD19A after Cycle 1; however, target saturation could drop to lower level in Cycle 1. [0058] A simulation was run for an ALL patient with high baseline CD19 expression and 10% bone marrow blasts and hypercellularity. SGN-CD19A was administered on a fixed dosage schedules: 1.6 mg/kg on days 1 and 7 of a 21 day cycle; 2.2 mg/kg every two weeks; or 3 mg/kg every three weeks. The model was used to predict the percentage of CD 19 on blast cells that were bound to SGN-CD19A (CD19 occupancy). High target saturation was assumed to occur if 90% of the CD 19 proteins on blasts were occupied. Figure 6A provides the results for cancer that is sensitive to treatment, while Figure 6B provides the results for a cancer that is insensitive to treatment. Simulation results suggest that at dose intensity of ~1 mg/kg/week, all dosing schedules appear to achieve high and comparable target occupancy by SGN-CD19A. [0059] A simulation was run for an ALL patient with low baseline CD19 expression and 100% bone marrow blasts with blast hypercellularity. As above, SGN-CD19A was administered on a fixed dosage schedules: 1.6 mg/kg on days 1 and 7 of a 21 day cycle; 2.2 mg/kg every two weeks; or 3 mg/kg every three weeks. The model was used to predict the percentage of CD 19 on blast cells that were bound to SGN-CD19A (CD19 occupancy). High target saturation was assumed to occur if 90% of the CD 19 proteins on blasts were occupied. Figure 7 A provides the results for cancer that is sensitive to treatment, while Figure 7B provides the results for a cancer that is insensitive to treatment. Simulation results suggest that at dose intensity of ~1 mg/kg/week, all dosing schedules appear to achieve high and comparable target occupancy by SGN-CD19A. [0060] The remaining simulations tested more frequent doses or loading doses of SGN- CD19A followed by less frequent and/or lower maintenance doses. A simulation was run for an ALL patient with high baseline CD19 expression and 100% bone marrow blasts and hypercellularity. The dose scenario used 2 mg/kg dose given on days 1 and 8 of a twenty-one day cycle for the entire test period. The other doses started with 2 mg/kg given on days 1 and 8 of a twenty-one day cycle, followed by 2, 1 or 0.5 mg/kg given every three weeks. Figure 8A provides the results for cancer that is sensitive to treatment, while Figure 8B provides the results for a cancer that is less sensitive to treatment. Simulation results suggest that when given every three weeks a dose of 2 mg/kg is needed to achieve high CD 19 occupancy by SGN-CD19A during maintenance for sensitive disease while more than 2 mg/kg is needed for less sensitive disease. [0061] A loading dose simulation was run for an ALL patient with high baseline CD 19 expression and 100% bone marrow blasts and hypercellularity. This loading dose scenario used 5 mg/kg given on days 1 of a twenty-one day cycle for the entire test period. The other doses started with 5 mg/kg given on days 1 of a twenty-one day cycle, followed by 3, 2, or 1 mg/kg given every three weeks. Figure 9 A provides the results for cancer that is sensitive to treatment, while Figure 9B provides the results for a cancer that is less sensitive to treatment. Simulation results suggest that when given every three weeks a dose of 2 mg/kg is needed to achieve high CD19 occupancy by SGN-CD19A during maintenance for sensitive disease while 3 mg/kg is needed for less sensitive disease. [0062] A loading dose simulation was run for an ALL patient with low baseline CD 19 expression and 100% bone marrow blasts with blast hypercellularity. This dose scenario used 2 mg/kg given on days 1 and 8 of a twenty-one day cycle for the entire test period. The other doses started with 2 mg/kg given on days 1 and 8 of a twenty-one day cycle, followed by 2, 1 or 0.5 mg/kg given every three weeks. Figure 10A provides the results for cancer that is sensitive to treatment, while Figure 10B provides the results for a cancer that is less sensitive to treatment. Simulation results suggest that when given every three weeks a dose of 2 mg/kg is needed to achieve high CD 19 occupancy by SGN-CD19A during maintenance for sensitive and less sensitive diseases. [0063] A loading dose simulation was run for an ALL patient with low baseline CD 19 expression and 100% bone marrow blasts with blast hypercellularity. This loading dose scenario used 5 mg/kg given on days 1 of a twenty-one day cycle for the entire test period. The other doses started with 5 mg/kg given on days 1 of a twenty-one day cycle, followed by 3, 2, or 1 mg/kg given every three weeks. Figure 11 A provides the results for cancer that is sensitive to treatment, while Figure 1 IB provides the results for a cancer that is less sensitive to treatment. Simulation results suggest that when given every three weeks a dose of 2 mg/kg is needed to achieve high CD 19 occupancy by SGN-CD19A during maintenance for sensitive and less sensitive diseases.
