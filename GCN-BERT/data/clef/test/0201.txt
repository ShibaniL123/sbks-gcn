Preparation of Olaparib from 5-[(3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1-phthalazinyl)methyl]-2-fluorobenzoic acid (compound D)
5-[(3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1-phthalazinyl)methyl]-2-fluorobenzoic acid (compound D) (1.012 g, 3.393 mmol, 1.0 equiv.) and acetone (10.0 mL, 10 vol.) were charged to a 3-neck 50 mL flask equipped with a 2 cm stir bar, thermal couple and N2 inlet. The resulting suspension was cooled to 0° C. N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (0.67 mL, 4.1 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) was added dropwise to the above resulting suspension at 0° C., followed by addition of pivaloyl chloride (0.50 mL, 4.1 mmol, 1.2 equiv.) at 0° C. After the addition, the resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 3 hours. Upon completion, the mixture was cooled to 0° C. N-cyclopropanoyl piperazinium p-toluenesulfonate (compound A) (1.21 g, 4.00 mmol, 1.1 equiv.) was added in portions at 0° C., and then acetone (0.5 mL) was added to rinse. Subsequently, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (0.83 mL, 5.0 mmol, 1.5 equiv.) was added dropwise to the above flask at 0° C. After the addition, the resulting mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 3 hours. Upon completion, the suspension was diluted with NaHCO3(aq) (20 mL) and EtOAc (20 mL), and then stirred for 1 hour at 0° C. in an ice bath. After stirring, the mixture was filtered through a Buchner funnel to afford off-white solids. The filtrate was extracted with EtOAc (20 mL) three times. The combined organic part was washed with NaHCO3(aq) (20 mL), water (20 mL), and NaCl(aq) (20 mL) to give a clear EtOAc solution. The above resulting off-white solids were combined with the EtOAc solution and concentrated. The resulting solids were dissolved in methanol (MeOH) (25 mL) and stirred at 65° C., followed by slow addition of water (50 mL). The resulting clear solution was cooled to room temperature and stirred overnight. The slurry was filtered through a Buchner funnel. The obtained wet cake was washed with water (25 mL) twice and dried at not more than 60° C. under vacuum overnight to afford olaparib as off-white solid (1.32 g, 3.04 mmol, 89.5% Yield).
