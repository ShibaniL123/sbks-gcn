Example 101A
Ethyl 4-{[(6-bromo-3-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}-2-hydroxybicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate (racemate)
At RT, 1.49 g (4.37 mmol) of the compound from Example 3A, 2.49 g (6.55 mmol) of HATU and 3.0 ml (17.46 mmol) of DIPEA were added in succession to a solution of 1.09 g (4.37 mmol) of ethyl 4-amino-2-hydroxybicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate (preparation described in WO2014/18891 A1, p. 148) in 15 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at 60Â° C. for 17 h. After cooling to RT, the mixture was added to 250 ml of a 10% strength aqueous citric acid solution. The resulting precipitate was filtered off, washed three times with 25 ml of water in each case and dried under reduced pressure. The solid was then taken up in dichloromethane and purified by column chromatography (100 g of silica gel, Biotage, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 7:3). 1.10 g (45% of theory, 97% purity) of the title compound was obtained.
