The surfactant may present in a level from about 0.01% to about 10%, or from about 0.05% to about 5% or from about 0.1% to about 2% or from about 0.5% to about 2% or from about 1.0% to about 2.0%. In one embodiment, the surface charge on the matrix is altered to optimize attachment of the targeting moiety by attaching charged moieties or adjusting the type of surfactant and/or matrix used in the production of the targeted drug delivery complex. Particle size is preferably less than 1 μm with the particles ranging in size between about 10 nm to 1000 nm or between about 20 nm to about 900 nm or from about 30 nm to abut 800 nm or from about 40 nm to about 700 nm or from about 50 nm to about 650 nm or from about 100 nm to about 750 nm or from about 200 nm to about 750 nm or from about 300 nm to about 750 nm or from about 300 nm to about 650 nm or from about 400 nm to about 750 nm or from about 400 nm to about 660 nm or from about 500 nm to about 750 nm or from about 500 nm to about 650 nm. Particle shape may be, but is not limited to spheres, prolate and oblate spheroids, cylindrical, and irregular shapes. The particles may be neutral or may be positively or negatively charged and may have a combination of surface charges resulting in a net neutral, positive or negative charge. The targeted drug delivery complexes of the present invention further comprise an API. The API may be incorporated into the drug delivery particles of the present invention by one or several of the following ways. In one embodiment, the API can be solubilized in the particle resulting in a solid or liquid solution of the API in the particle material or matrix. In an alternative embodiment, the API can be dispersed within the particle material or matrix such that discrete multi-atom units of the API exist. In yet another embodiment, the API can be attached to the outside of the particle in molecular or particulate form. Examples of APIs useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, analgesics, anti-anginal agents, anti-asthmatics, anti-arrhythmic agents, anti-angiogenic agents, antibacterial agents, anti-benign prostate hypertrophy agents, anti-cystic fibrosis agents, anti-coagulants, anti-depressants, anti-diabetic agents, anti-epileptic agents, anti-fungal agents, anti-gout agents, anti-hypertensive agents, anti-inflammatory agents, anti-malarial agents, anti-migraine agents, anti-muscarinic agents, anti-neoplastic agents, anti-obesity agents, anti-osteoporosis agents, anti-parkinsonian agents, anti-protozoal agents, anti-thyroid agents, anti-urinary incontinence agents, anti-viral agents, anxiolytics, beta-blockers, cardiac inotropic agents, cognition enhancers, corticosteroids, COX-2 inhibitors, diuretics, erectile dysfunction improvement agents, essential fatty acids, gastrointestinal agents, histamine receptor antagonists, hormones, immunosuppressants, keratolyptics, leukotriene antagonists, lipid regulating agents, macrolides, muscle relaxants, non-essential fatty acids, nutritional agents, nutritional oils, protease inhibitors and stimulants.
