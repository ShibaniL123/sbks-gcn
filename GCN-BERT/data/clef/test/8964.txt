Patent and Trade Mark Attorneys ΡΟ Box 833, Blackwood, SA 5051 Invention Title: Bendable and Shape-Retaining Hair Cutting Apparatus The following statement is a full description of this invention, including the best method of performing it known to me/us:- BENDABLE AND SHAPE-RETAINING HAIR CUTTING APPARATUS FIELD OF THE TECHNOLOGY The present application relates to a bendable and shape-retaining hair cutting apparatus. BACKGROUND Cutting of hair usually involves the use of a comb and a pair of scissors. A user needs to use both hands to cut hair. One hand is used to hold the comb and run it down a section of the hair. When a desired length is reached, the user anchors the hair between the index and middle fingers and snips the ends sticking out of the fingers. This snipping action has to be repeated many times until the ends are uniform. This haircutting process is time consuming. The ends of the hair may not be uniformly cut, and the fingers may be injured by the sharp blades of the scissors. Also, stylish haircuts are difficult to create because the comb and the blades of the scissors are straight and not bendable. There is a need to produce a bendable and shape-retaining hair cutting apparatus for creating stylish haircuts of various shapes and cutting hair quickly in one push of a button. The above description of the background is provided to aid in understanding a hair cutting apparatus, but is not admitted to describe or constitute pertinent prior art to the hair cutting apparatus, or consider the cited documents as material to the patentability of the claims of the present application.

Further, the terms “first”, “second”, etc. are merely used to differentiate features to be described, and are not meant to indicate or imply the relative importance of the features. FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 show an embodiment of a bendable and shape-retaining hair cutting apparatus. As used herein, the term “bendable” means (a long object) capable of being turned or bent by force from a straight form into a curved or angular form, as well as from a curved or angular form into some other form or back into the straight form. Similarly, as used herein, the term “bend” means turning (a long object) by force from a straight form into a curved or angular form, as well as from a curved or angular form into some other form or back into the straight form. As used herein, the term “shape-retaining” means (a long object) being able to hold its shape when bent and does not bounce back to its original position. And, as used herein, the term “bendable and shape-retaining metal or alloy” means a metal or alloy having bendable and shape-retaining characteristics so that when a long object is made of such metal or alloy, the long object can be bent and held in the bent shape without bouncing back to its original position. The bendable and shape-retaining hair cutting apparatus may include first and second resilient clip members 10, 12 disposed side-by-side and provided with oppositely facing first and second grooves 14, 16 formed on opposite inner sides 18, 20 of the first and second resilient clip members 10, 12 respectively. The first and second resilient clip members 10, 12 may be made of shape-retaining plastic that can retain their shapes when bent. The shape-retaining plastic may be polyethylene, polyurethane, polystyrene, or combinations thereof, or any other appropriate material. A hinged end of the first clip member 10 may be hingedly connected with a hinged end of the second clip member 12 by a hinge 40, and an opposite free end of the first clip member 10 can be fastened to an opposite free end of the second clip member 12 by a fastener 50. The bendable and shape-retaining hair cutting apparatus may include a first blade 22 and a second blade 24. The first blade 22 can be fixedly mounted in the first groove 14 by adhesive material, fasteners or any other suitable means. The second blade 24 can be moveably mounted in the second groove 16, and adapted to be inserted into the first groove 14 and driven into a slidable and shearing engagement with the first blade 22. The first and second blades 22, 24 may be made of bendable and shape-retaining metal or alloy such as copper, copper alloy, aluminum, aluminum alloy, or combinations thereof, or any other suitable metal or alloy. When the first and second blades 22, 24 are made of bendable and shape-retaining metal such as copper, the first and second blades 22, 24 can be bent in an upward or downward direction from a plane on which the first and second blades 22, 24 lie into a desired shape, and retained into the desired shape. Both or one of the first and second blades 22, 24 may have a sharpened cutting edge. At least one push plate 26 may extend transversely from an inner lateral side 28 of the second blade 24 and through a transverse bore 30 formed on an outer side 32 of the second clip member 12. A free end 34 of the push plate 26 may protrude outwardly from the outer side 32 of the second clip member 12. A push button 36 may be fixed at the free end 34 of the push plate 26. A spring 38 may be mounted on the push plate 26 between the second blade 24 and the push button 36 for biasing the second blade 24 in a retracted position inside the second groove 16. The first and second clip members 10, 12 together with the first and second blades 22, 24 provided therein can be bent into a plurality of desired shapes. When the push button 36 is pushed against the spring 38, the second blade 24 moves laterally towards the first blade 22 and enters into slidable and shearing engagement with the first blade 22, thereby cutting hair clipped between the first and second clip members 10, 12 to create a plurality of haircuts of the desired shapes. The push button 36 can return to its original retracted position inside the second groove 16 under the influence of the biasing force of the spring 38 when the push button 36 is released after cutting. FIGS. 4 and 5 show another embodiment of the two blades of the bendable and shape-retaining hair cutting apparatus. In the illustrated embodiment, the second blade 24 may be in the form of a toothed blade formed with a plurality of teeth 60 adapted to be inserted into the first groove 14 and slidably engaged with the first blade 24 when the first and second clip members 10, 12 are clipped together. The method for creating stylish haircuts of various shapes and cutting hair in one push of a button using the bendable and shape-retaining hair cutting apparatus of the present application is shown in FIGS. 6(a) to 6(f). To cut hair, a user first holds or fastens the first and second clip members 10, 12 side-by-side together, as shown in FIG. 6(a). The user then bends the first and second clip members 10, 12 together with the first and second blades 22, 24 provided therein into a desired shape, as shown in FIG. 6(b). In this example, the desired shape is an upwardly curved shape. The user then flips out the second clip member 12 and positions hair to be cut between the first and second clip members 10, 12, as shown in FIG. 6(c). The second clip member 12 is then flipped back to the side-by-side closed position thereby clipping the hair to be cut between the first and second clip members 10, 12, as shown in FIG. 6(d). Finally, the user pushes the push button 36 once so that the second blade 24 is moved laterally towards the first blade 22 and entered into slidable and shearing engagement therewith, thereby cutting hair clipped between the first and second clip members, as shown in FIG. 6(e). An upwardly curved haircut is then created, as shown in FIG. 6(f). FIG. 7(a) - 7(j) show the creation of haircuts of various shapes using the bendable and shape-retaining hair cutting apparatus of the present application. FIG. 7(a) shows a “straight cut” of the hair at the back a head. FIG. 7(b) shows a “straight bangs cut” of the hair above the forehead. FIG. 7(c) shows an “upwardly curved cut” of the hair at the back of a head. FIG. 7(d) shows a “downwardly curved bangs cut” of the hair above the forehead. FIG. 7(e) shows a “U-shaped cut” of the hair at the nape area at the back of a head. FIG. 7(f) shows a “V-shaped cut” of the hair at the back of a head. FIG. 7(g) shows a “wavy cut” of the hair at the back of a head. Two or more bendable and shape-retaining hair cutter apparatuses can be used at the same time to create two or more layers of hair of different lengths and/or different shapes, as shown in FIGS. 7(h) and (i). As shown in FIG. 7(h), a user can cut hair at two different lengths of the hair using two bendable and shape-retaining hair cutting apparatuses bent into two different shapes respectively, thereby creating two layers of hair having two different shapes. As shown in FIG. 7(i), a user can cut hair at three different lengths of the hair using three bendable and shape-retaining hair cutting apparatuses respectively, thereby creating three layers of hair having different lengths. The bendable and shape-retaining hair cutting apparatus may also be used to produce some popular haircuts, such as “long bob cut” shown in FIG. 7(j), “pageboy cut” shown in FIG. 7(k), and “blunt cut” shown in FIG. 7(1). FIG. 8 is a fragmentary view of the first and second clip members 10, 12 showing a corrugated surface 70 formed on the inner side 20 of the second clip member 12. The corrugated surface 70 can be used to provide a space between the first and second clip members 10, 12 for receiving and holding thereinbetween hair to be cut. FIGS. 9 and 10 show an embodiment of the hinge 40 of the bendable and shape-retaining hair cutting apparatus. The hinge 40 may include first and second pins 401, 402 inserted into first and second pin holes 403, 404 formed on the hinged ends of the first and second clip members 10, 12 respectively.
