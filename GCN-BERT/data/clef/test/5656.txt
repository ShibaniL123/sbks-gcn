CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This is a National Stage application claiming the benefit of International Application Number PCT/IB2013/059522 filed on 22 Oct. 2013 (22 Oct. 2013), which claims the benefit of United Stated Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/795,661, filed on 22 Oct. 2012 (22 Oct. 2012), both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to a novel closed system photobioreactor comprising plastic sheeting, sealed to form a container or tubular flat sleeve, coated with a thin layer of a highly dense culture of photoautotrophic single celled organism. Carbon dioxide is exchanged from the sealed, enclosed gas space above the horizontal culture through attendant mixing by subtending wave motion. The invention provides a substantial improvement in processing costs, in growth media sterilization, as well as reduced expenses related to energy and raw materials, especially carbon dioxide. Capital expenses are reduced by eliminating the need for sparging and compressors used for suspending cells and mixing carbon dioxide. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Microalgae (broadly defined herein to include photosynthetic single celled eukaryotic algae and cyanobacteria) have a very high growth potential; more than ten times the productivity per unit area compared to terrestrial crops. Microalgae are potentially appropriate raw materials for producing low cost biofuels, animal feeds, and other products. Various impediments have prevented achieving this potential; the biological impediments of using undomesticated organisms are being overcome by genetic engineering of the microalgae (Gressel 2013). The impediment of the high cost of algal harvesting (dewatering) by high-speed (energy intensive) centrifugation has been overcome by a novel flocculation technology that is dependent on cultivating dense cultures of the microalgae (US2011/081706). The major remaining impediments are in cultivation; both in the expense of the structures used, and the high costs of running them. Open raceway ponds and their derivatives are inexpensive to construct, but must have a depth of at least 40 cm to allow adequate mixing and dissolution of bubbled (sparged) carbon dioxide. Even then, a considerable amount of carbon dioxide is lost to the atmosphere. The algae must be kept relatively dilute to allow light penetration, and even then all photons are typically absorbed in the upper 5-10 cm, and the material below respires photosynthate, decreasing yield from the potential. There is a high cost in sterilizing the large volumes of water used, in the compressors needed for bubbling, in the paddle wheels for mixing, and for the unused carbon dioxide lost. Cooling of open raceways is inexpensive in dry climates, i.e. is evaporative, requiring replacement with fresh water, even with marine algae to prevent over salinization. Open systems are easily contaminated by other unwanted species, including other algae, microbes, and algae-eating protozoan and metazoan herbivores, and thus various closed systems have been designed, but cooling is especially expensive for closed systems, because the deep water adsorbs infrared radiation that causes heating, which cannot be dissipated by evaporative cooling. A generic diagram of such a closed bioreactor is shown in FIG. 1, and how it fits in a general cultivation system is outlined in FIG. 2 A, B, C. This design differs substantially from the many designs proposed for photobioreactors (see Table 1 below), as the algae herein are cultivated in a concentrated thin layer, which together with the use of shear-wave motion, renders sparging as unnecessary.

At a depth of 5 cm ca. 90% of the near-infra-red (most of the infrared from the sun, and the part with the greatest energy) is adsorbed, resulting in heating the algae above their optimum growth temperature in many environments, and at 50 cm 99% would be adsorbed resulting in considerable heating. At 5 mm only 9% would be adsorbed in a floating bioreactor, and the rest would penetrate to the water below, easing the cooling and heat exchange. The bubbling in many photobioreactor (PBR) designs is for two reasons—to mix algae and keep them suspended, and to introduce C02. The C02 in previous systems must often be diluted with air because at higher concentrations C02, the bubbling rate required for mixing would overly acidify the medium. This is especially a problem with larger celled algae, as they settle more quickly than small-celled algae, and more mixing energy is required. Large volumes of C02-enriched air are thus pumped at high energy costs, losing much of the C02. The present invention precludes the need for using bubbles for mixing and reduces the cost of C02, sterile medium, harvesting, and produces less effluent if medium after harvest is not recycled. Methods other than sparge bubbling have also been proposed; e.g. mixing the carbon dioxide with the medium being introduced by co-flowing over a solid substrate, and (un-economically) adding NaOH to the medium to capture atmospheric C02 and thereby generate bicarbonate (EP 2 371 940). Many closed vertical systems constructed above ground are made rigid or flexible sheets, tubes, plastic bags/sleeves, or glass walls are described in Table 1. Such structures allow more concentrated growth, and use efficient (but high compression cost) bubbling of carbon dioxide mixed air. The capital costs of the rigid materials are high, as are superstructure costs to assure that they will not be destroyed in high winds. Evaporative cooling from the culture media is impossible in closed systems, and as the water in the structures absorbs infrared light, and cooling can be expensive. Short optical paths can be designed in such systems, allowing increased density of algae (Table 1). Horizontal or near horizontal systems (Table 1) allow for less superstructure. One system (US2007/0048848) uses recumbent flexible plastic sleeves with mixing affected by a track support of peristaltic rollers, with no explanation of how temperature is to be controlled. In another (dimensionless) system, a gas plug is moved through channels by somehow tilting the system to move a gas plug along through the system as a standing wave (US2011/0281339). The density of algal cells and method of cooling is not disclosed therein, and there are superstructures required to perform the tilting. Totally horizontal systems (Table 1) using plastic film are far less expensive, and are used floating on the sea, where wave motion provides some mixing and the seawater provides the cooling. Both are appropriate only for fresh water algae as they achieve their buoyancy by floating the bioreactors on seawater, using the specific gravity differences to keep them afloat. Carbon dioxide mixed with air is pressure bubbled through the system using spargers, and significant amounts are wasted, as in the other systems. An optical path of 10-15 cm is needed to optimally use the carbon dioxide. There is no horizontal system reported where the depth of algae is less than 5 cm or where carbon dioxide is provided other than by sparging, and where excess oxygen is removed by any process other than venting (Table 1). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A thin layer horizontal system is disclosed herein where cooling is provided by floatation on water, where part of the solar infrared irradiation passes through the bioreactor into the water, and the rest is dissipated through the bottom thin layer of floating plastic sheeting acting as a heat exchanger (FIGS. 1 and 2A, B and C). Buoyancy is achieved by having a gas space above the algae, and thus marine algae in seawater can be cultivated above any type of water. Optimal light utilization is achieved by situating the algae in a thin, highly concentrated layer. Carbon dioxide is transferred from the gas space by wave motion eliminating the need for compressed carbon dioxide bubbles. Rapid diffusion of the carbon dioxide into the thin layer of algae (less than 1 cm in depth) is effected by various types of wave motion, including wave machine imposed waves, which can be augmented by fins attached to the bottom of the bioreactor, or mini-waves generated by vibrators or piezo-electric devices attached to the bottom sheet (FIGS. 3-9), or by using a bottom sheet that is rocked by low amplitude vibrations (FIG. 10). The types of waves that the agitation/excitation devices produce are crucial to the gas-algae mixing process. The frequency component of these waves must not inhibit algal growth processes; thus such ultrasonic frequencies within the mechanical excitation pulses produced by the piezoelectric or magneto-strictive devices must be avoided. Inducing Love (shear) waves forms larger inner layer gas algae interface areas and thus accelerate the mixing and micro organic processes. The device activation must be timed to produce the shear waves and turbulent vortices that promote gas-algae mixing. The thin-layer photobioreactor (TLPBR) is constructed from inexpensive plastic sheeting fabricated into wide sleeves, flexibly held flat floating over the cooling water. The excess oxygen emitted by photosynthesis can either purified and used in industrial processes or released to the atmosphere by through plastic sheeting that has an extensive permeability to oxygen but is less or impermeable to carbon dioxide (low beta value). The high density of algae requires less sterilized culture medium and facilitates the use of highly inexpensive flocculation technologies for harvesting the algae. No above ground superstructure or high pressure pumping are required. One embodiment of the present invention provides a photobioreactor for cultivating and growing microalgae comprising flexible plastic sheeting having a first and second face wherein said first (lower) face is coated with a layer of microalgae less than 1 cm in thickness and floats on the surface of a heat dissipating body of water with inlet and outlet opening for inserting algal inoculum and medium, and for harvesting excess algae (FIGS. 1 and 2A, B and C). The said second (upper) face of flexible sheeting contains a gas space. The gas space above contains a predetermined span of ratios of carbon dioxide to oxygen and a means for increasing the pressure of the gas space with inlet and outlet openings. A source of light is above the second (upper face), which may preferably be sunlight, or sunlight augmented with artificial illumination or artificial illumination alone. Below or attached to the lower face is a means for agitating the body of water and the algae in the bioreactor, facilitating gas exchange with the airspace, and heat exchange between the algal layer and the subtending water. Preferably the thickness of the microalgae coating is in the range of 2.5 to 5.0 mm. Another embodiment of the present invention provides a process for cultivating and growing microalgae comprising the steps of: (a) providing a photobioreactor comprising flexible plastic sheeting sealed as a container or tubular flat sleeve having a first and second face as described above said flexible sheeting comprising a predetermined amount of carbon dioxide and a body of heat exchanging water beneath and in contact with the sheeting; (b) coating the sheeting on said first face with a layer of microalgae less than 1 cm in thickness; (c) floating the first face of the sheeting on the surface of a body of heat dissipating water by virtue of having a gas space between the two faces providing buoyancy; (d) mechanically agitating the body of water causing vibrations and a wave-like motion using low amplitude wave generators (FIG. 3) where the spacing and timing of the transducers that generate the wave pulses can be set such that they generate shear waves that facilitate mixing and gas exchange in the algae layer. (e) these waves allow the carbon dioxide in the air space to dissolve in the aqueous mineral medium containing the algae and release the oxygen formed during photosynthesis to the airspace above; (f) exposing the microalgae to light; and (g) harvesting microalgae by exerting pressure between the sheeting and forcing the microalgae out of the photobioreactor through a suitable opening. In another embodiment the photobioreactor is comprised of algae and/or cyanobacteria selected from Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Amphiprora hyaline, Amphora spp., Chaetocerosmuelleri, Naviculasaprophila, Nitzschia sp., Nitzschiacommunis, Scenedesmusdimorphus, Scenedesmusobliquus, Tetraselmis suecica, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella vulgaris, Haematococcuspluvialis, Neochloris oleo abundans, Synechococcus elongates PCC6301, Botryococcusbraunii, Gloeobacter violaceusPCC742, SynechococcusPCC7002, SynechococcusPCC7942, SynechocystisPCC6803, Thermosynechococcus elongates BP-1, Nannochloropsis oculata, Nannochloropsis salina, Nannochloropsis spp., Nannochloropsis gaditana, Isochrysis aff. galbana, Aphanocapsa sp., Botryococcussudeticus, Euglena gracilis, Nitzschiapalea, Pleurochrysiscarterae, Tetraselmis chuii, Pavlova spp. and Nannochloris spp. as representatives of all algae and cyanobacteria species; preferably, the algae is freshwater Chlorella sp. or Chlamydomonas reinhardtii or Synechococcus PCC7002 (marine) or Synechococcus7942 (freshwater) or Nannochloris sp. or Nannochloropsis spp. or Isochrysis sp. CS-177 or Pavlovalutheri or Phaeodactylum tricornutum or Tetraselmis chuiior any combination thereof. In another embodiment the photobioreactor is comprised of fins attached beneath the lower plastic sheeting amplifying the movements caused by the mechanical wave generator or natural waves when floating on open water (FIG. 4), or causing reciprocal movement due to continuous or pulsed unidirectional water flow when tethered or rivers of artificial channels (FIG. 5). The fins can be set at specified distances such that they generate shear waves that intensify and mix the algae layer. These shear waves that form increase the gas-algae interface, facilitating efficient gas exchange between the air space and the algae growth medium. In all embodiments of the present invention provides a photobioreactor as described hereinabove wherein the pH of the water is maintained at the daytime optimum for photosynthesis for the particular algal species being cultivated (typically pH 6.5) through control of the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide, by controlling the production of waves through a feedback, where are artificially generated, and controlling the tautness of the tethers to limit or increase flexibility and mixing in bioreactors floating on natural wave generating bodies of water. In another embodiment the present invention provides a photobioreactor as described hereinabove wherein the temperature of the body of water is maintained at the optimum temperature for each species of algae through the use of heat exchange through the lower layer, through the use of river, sea or artificially cooled water in warm climates, or warm water from industrial effluent cooling water or other sources in winter in temperate climates. In another embodiment the present invention provides a photobioreactor as described hereinabove wherein the water agitation is generated by piezoelectric wires in a mesh formation (FIG. 6A) or as spread out single transducers inside the algal suspension (FIG. 6B). In another embodiment the present invention provides a photobioreactor as described hereinabove wherein the exposure to light is comprised of a light intensity from about 200μEiηβiβiηβ m“2 s”1 to full sunlight and a light to dark ratio of about 16 to 8 hr, or ambient natural light dark ratios. In another embodiment the present invention provides a photobioreactor as described hereinabove wherein the water agitation is generated by a series of mini-vibrators (FIGS. 7 and 8A, B, C and D). In the basic configuration put forth and detailed in FIGS. 8A and 8B the control of timing of excitation of individual mini-vibrators is pre-programmed to generate shear waves. The mini—vibrators can be mounted glued to the underside of the photobioreactor (FIG. 8A) or mounted inside rigid profiles that contribute to a near sag-free surface inside the photobioreactor (FIG. 8B). A localized control method of controlling the creation of shear waves is described in FIGS. 8C and 8D. A hydrophone senses the arrival of a wave from an adjacent mini-vibrator or transducer (piezoelectric or magnetostrictive) and activates the mini-vibrator and enhances the amplitude of the traversing shear wave. In another embodiment strips of plastic bubble material are affixed to the bottom of the bioreactor to prevent sag caused by the positive pressure in the airspace, and the weight of the mixing devices (FIG. 9). In another embodiment the bottom of the photobioreactor is reinforced with rigid plastic and trussed beams, and the waves are generated by vibrational rocking of the structure (FIG. 10). In the preferred embodiments where waves are artificially generated, the timing of the wave pulses can be set such that they generate shear waves that mix the algae layer. The shear waves that are so formed increase the gas-algae interface area, thus facilitating efficient gas exchange between the air space and the algae growth medium. In preferred embodiments the preferred plastics will have a low beta value, i.e. will pass oxygen and retain carbon dioxide, thus venting excess oxygen when the airspace exceeds the 20% oxygen in the outside atmosphere; preferred plastics are based upon one or more of the following polymers and copolymers and/or laminates thereof optionally blended with plasticizers and anti oxidants: polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylene, polycarbonate, polyester, polyamide, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, polystyrene copolymers of butadiene and styrene, polyurethane, polyacrylonitrile and polyacrylate in single or mixed multilayer sheets. In a preferred embodiment the top plastic is suitably treated to prevent degradation by ultraviolet light, reflects the maximum amount of infrared light possible (to reduce cooling cost) without overly reducing transmission of photosynthetically active irradiation, and does not support having light-reflecting condensate on the inner side. The top plastic in a preferred embodiment is specially treated to transmit (and not reflect) low angle light in early morning and late afternoon. In the embodiments where 100% carbon dioxide is the starting gas, molecular sieve filtration system may be used to remove the oxygen emitted during photosynthesis (as a valuable co-product) and then the plastic used will be chosen to have the least possible permeability to all gases. In other embodiments the upper plastic layer will be a low beta value plastic that transmits oxygen and retains carbon dioxide, preventing inhibition of photosynthesis by excess oxygen and precluding the need to periodically vent the bioreactors to remove excess oxygen (and lose some carbon dioxide) or necessitate the more expensive molecular sieve filtration. In preferred embodiments harvesting will be performed at intervals based on photometric density determination of the algae removing 25-50% of the algae containing fluid, and immediately replacing the fluid with essential mineral (fertilizer) augmented sea or fresh water based medium (depending on the algal species used). The preferred algal species used are those that rapidly remove and internally store essential elements from the medium for future use, as they compete best with unwanted species. The amount of fertilizer added is just enough not to limit growth, and have all essential elements removed and utilized by the algae prior to the next harvesting cycle, such that there is minuscule fertilizer wastage, and less problem of fertilizer in effluents. The bottom plastic in preferred embodiments will be of a plastic having the maximum cost-effective rate of heat exchange. When transgenic herbicide resistant algae are used, the inner surface layer of the bottom plastic may be impregnated with the appropriate herbicide to facilitate slow release to control alien species. The inner layers of the top and bottom plastic sheets may be impregnated with non-phytotoxic fungicides and anti-microbials to allow slow release and prevention of contamination and biofilm formation. In one embodiment semi-rigid flexible fins are attached to the bottom plastic perpendicular to the direction of water flow. By having the water flow in waves or controlled surges, the fins will wiggle the bottom plastic facilitating the continuous suspension of the algae and the introduction and dissolution of the carbon dioxide into the media (FIGS. 4, 5). The intensity and the frequencies of the pulsed surges are feedback controlled by the pH and temperature sensors to control C02 and temperature in the photobioreactor. The intensity of mixing can be further dampened or increased by servo-mechanically adjusting the tension on the tethering ropes. In a sea situation, the tidal movement can be used to flutter the fins as the tide comes in/goes out. In unidirectional flow systems (floating on rivers, on land, on flood plains) the water movement can be used to flutter the system. In all the embodiments harvesting is accelerated by the positive pressure of the gas space above the algae in the photobioreactor, that expels the algae into the opened harvest outlet. The fresh, brackish, or marine algae and cyanobacteria can be (non-exclusively) selected from the following list: In the various embodiments, algae and cyanobacteria were chosen from the following organisms: Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Amphiprora hyaline, Amphora spp., Chaetocerosmuelleri, Naviculasaprophila, Nitzschia sp., Nitzschiacommunis, Scenedesmusdimorphus, Scenedesmusobliquus, Tetraselmis suecica, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella vulgaris, Haematococcuspluvialis, Neochloris oleo abundans, Synechococcus elongates PCC6301, Botryococcus braunii, Gloeobacter violaceusPCC742̂, SynechococcusPCC7002, SynechococcusPCC7942, SynechocystisPCC6803, Thermosynechococcus elongates BP-1, Nannochloropsis oculata, Nannochloropsis salina, Nannochloropsis spp., Nannochloropsis gaditana, Isochrysis aff. galbana, Aphanocapsa sp., Botryococcus sudeticus, Euglena gracilis, Nitzschiapalea, Pleurochrysiscarterae, Tetraselmis chuii, Pavlova spp. and Nannochloris spp. as representatives of all algae and cyanobacteria species. The algae come from a large taxonomical cross section of species (see Table 2 below).

The smaller unicellular species are typically/usually preferred, as they can be kept suspended in solution with the minimum amount of energy. With minor modification in the harvesting system, the growth structures can be used for cultivation of small water plants such as duckweeds (Lemnaceae). Instead of pressuring material to be harvested through a port in the bottom sheet, a skimming device is used to harvest the duckweeds. In all embodiments the algae used can be wild type isolates or mixed species, or they can be genetically engineered to have traits that increase reliability in culture (see Table 3 below), or that provide value added to the algae (see Table 4 below).

(2013) It is however, clear for one skilled in the art that the examples of possible transgenes listed in Tables 3 and 4 are not exclusive, but that various other genera and species can be used as well. In all embodiments, the density of the algae should be sufficient that the inexpensive flocculation system described by Schlesinger et al. (2012) can be used, and the effluent water recycled back into the culture system after adding concentrated fertilizer. The ideal places for the cultivation of algae in the photobioreactors are: (1) On river flood plains where crops cannot be reliably cultivated. Cooling water can be supplied by gravity from weirs begun upstream; (2) Structures akin to rice paddies or such as abandoned shrimp farms near the sea with added pumping systems; (3) Floating in rivers; (4) In protected bays or estuaries; (5) In temperate climates: near power plants, near hot springs or other sources of hot water that can be a source of warm water in winter, as well as carbon dioxide (6) In open seas with system to lower bioreactors deep into the sea in stormy weather (U.S. 2011/0124087). In this case the airspace will have to mostly emptied prior to sinking, and re-floating can be facilitated by pumping in gas. Since the algae in the photobioreactors adsorb virtually all photons, the best locations are where there is maximal irradiation, deserts (preferably near the sea) +30° N/S from the equator. (7) These photobioreactors allow covering of water reservoirs, whether for drinking or for irrigation or industrial use, where they have certain advantages: 1. By covering the surface they prevent evaporative water loss, and do so without cost to the reservoir owner, as the algae are being commercially cultivated, and; 2. By having the algae form a layer that is not penetrated by light, photosynthetic algae and cyanobacteria cannot grow in the reservoir water, precluding the production of toxins and other undesirable compounds by algae and cyanobacteria.

The low amplitude (mini)waves are formed by mechanical eccentric piston driven wave generators at the side(s) of the bioreactors, actuated electronically when the pH rises above a fixed value for each species to generate shear)waves to optimally dissolve carbon dioxide from the airspace and lower the pH. FIG. 4 is a modified version of the photobioreactor shown in FIG. 3 whereby flexible fins are attached to the bottom of the bioreactor to augment and optimize the wave action of waves generated by the wave machine, to amplify the vibration of the bioreactor and thus cause greater wave motion. It consists of: 2-3 mm thick, 2-4 cm wide plastic strips pre-embedded by folding and welding or adhesive sealing to the lower plastic sheets across the width of the sleeve when waves are to be generated over the length of the bioreactor (and then will also prevent sagging in the middle of the bio-reactor), or across the length of the bioreactor if the waves are generated from the sides. The fins are spaced in parallel 20-90 cm apart, preferably 25-50 cm apart. FIG. 5 is a modified version of the photobioreactor shown in FIG. 3 whereby flexible fins are attached to the bottom of the bioreactor to augment and optimize the wave action of waves generated by unidirectional flowing water to amplify the vibration of the bioreactor and thus cause greater wave motion. It consists of: 2-3 mm thick, 2-4 cm wide plastic strips pre-embedded by folding and welding or adhesive sealing to the lower plastic sheets across the width of the sleeve when waves are to be generated over the length of the bioreactor (and then will also prevent sagging in the middle of the bio-reactor), or across the length of the bioreactor if the waves are generated from the sides. The fins are spaced in parallel 20-90 cm apart, preferably 25-50 cm apart, with unequal spacing calculated to form shear waves. FIGS. 6A and B are a modified version of the photobioreactor shown in FIG. 3 whereby there is no wave generating machine. Instead wires are embedded in, or welded to the bottom of the TLPBR and mini-waves are generated by vibrating the wires by piezoelectric action. The wires can be stretched the width of the bioreactors (6B) or can be criss-crossed (6A) and actuated electronically in a manner calculated to form shear waves. FIG. 7. is a modified version of the photobioreactor shown in FIG. 6 whereby there is no wave generating machine. Instead wires are attached to the bottom of the TLPBR and mini-waves are generated by low energy requiring, low DC voltage vibrators (see FIGS. 8A, B, C and D for details). The electrical wires providing the energy to the vibrators can be stretched the width of the bioreactors and be held taut to prevent sag and keep the bioreactor level. FIGS. 8A, B, C and Dare different versions of the photobioreactor shown in FIG. 7 whereby waves are generated by mini-vibrator arrays, were the separate low energy requiring, low DC voltage vibrators are glued to the bottom (A) or embedded in U shaped plastic profiles where the space not occupied by the vibrators are filled with a hydrophobic plastic foam (e.g. polystyrene, or polyurethane) that confer buoyancy to the rigid structure (B). The vibrators can be pre-programmed to be excited at intervals that generate shear waves (A and B) or hydrophones can be mounted nearby to detect wave motion and activate the vibrators to generate the shear waves (C and D). FIG. 9 is a modified version of the photobioreactor shown in FIGS. 3-5 whereby rows of plastic bubbles (similar to bubble wrap used in packing) are attached by adhesive or are welded to the bottom facing the cooling water) to further prevent sag in the middle of the bioreactors. FIG. 10 is an illustration of a solid, bottom floating photobioreactor where waves are generated by low amplitude vibratory motion. Because it is floating, there is very little weight bearing, allowing need for lighter supports and minimal energy to perform the vibratory, wave-generating rocking. FIG. 11 is an illustration of a laboratory scale exemplary and non-limiting thin layer floating on water photobioreactor. FIG. 12. Diagram demonstrating how vibrating pulses on the plastic sheet generate near shear waves at the point where waves from each pulse meet. FIG. 13. Configuration of medium introduction into a photobioreactor. Medium is introduced at places where a doubled concentration of algae is reached by controlling flow rate of introduced algae and medium. The medium minerals are introduced at a rate where they are depleted by the time of algae doubling. This generates a slowly moving plug of algae towards the harvesting aperture. The length of the last phase before algae are forced out of the harvesting aperture can be varied based on whether a phase of stationary growth is desired to force metabolism of specialty products, e.g. increased secondary metabolites or neutral lipids.

EXAMPLES The algae used in the following examples, their growth media, and the mode of culture before seeding in the photobioreactors are described below: Algal species used in the following examples Freshwater Chlorella sp. and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and Synechococcus PCC 7002 (marine), Synechococcus7942 (freshwater), Nannochloris sp., Nannochloropsis spp. sochrysis sp. CS-177, Pavlovalutheri, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Tetraselmis chuiiare used in the examples below. Algal Cultivation for Seeding Algae were cultured indoors in 2 L polyethylene sleeves. A constant temperature regime was maintained at 23° C., light:dark was set at 16:8 h, light intensity of 200μEiηβiβiηβm″2 s′ Cultures were mixed by aeration using 4% C02 mixed into air during the day and delivered to the cultures at a controlled rate via the aeration system to maintain pH7. During the dark period air alone was bubbled. Culture Media Marine algal species and Synechococcus PCC 7002 were cultured in the laboratory in 0.45μηη ultra-filtered seawater enriched with F/2 nutrient enrichment (Guillard and Ryther, 1962), and out of doors a commercial fertilizer mix diluted 1000 fold with UV-sterilized seawater. The concentrated commercial fertilizer contained (in meq.) 703 N03″, 268 NH4″, 213 P205, 771 K20, 604 Ca+2, 229 Mg+2, 13 Fe+2, 6.6 Mn+2, 2.8 Zn+2, 0.4 Cu+2, 0.2 Mo (calculated from brochure of supplier). Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was cultured in 0.45μηη ultra-filtered TAP culture medium (Gorman and Levine, 1965). Synechococcus7942 was cultured in 0.45μηη ultra-filtered BG1 1 culture medium (http://www.crbip.pasteur.fr/fiches/fichemedium.jsp?id=539, accessed 1 Jun. 2012). Example 1 Laboratory Proof of Concept As shown in FIG. 11, a Large Plastic Basin Filled 2/3 with Water was Fitted with a 4×4 cm wooden board the width of the basin with a rod mounted perpendicular to the center of a long side of the board. The rod was mounted through a plastic pipe just larger than the rod, acting as a bearing to ensure up and down motion. The rod was attached to eccentric cam via a short rod with bearings at either end, on a slow, adjustable motor, such that when the motor is activated, the up and down movement on the board generated waves. Grommets are welded ca. 1 cm below the seams on sealed ends food-grade polyethylene sleeve (typically but not exclusively) 0.5 mm thickness) such that it could be loosely or spring-tethered flat on the water with thick rubber bands. Various sealable ports are inserted in the upper sheet of the sleeve: an inlet for medium, an inlet for C02, an outlet with pressure valve that keeps the airspace inflated and releases excess gas, an inlet through which a mini-pH electrode is inserted with its tip near the bottom of the flat sleeve. In various experiments algae at a density of ca. 108 cells/ml and an absorbancy at 695 nm of ca. 3.0 (based on 1 cm light path) are introduced (the actual values depend on the species used). In various runs fresh water Chlamydomonas and Chlorella, marine Nannochloropsis and Nannochloris algae and fresh water Synechococcus7942 (cyanobacterium) are used. In various experiments a 3-7 mm layer of algae were introduced. The sleeve's air space above the algae was flushed with 100% C02 and then using a flow valve, a slow rate of 10 liters per hour. The pH electrode inserted into the algal suspension was attached to an aquarium pH controller, which is used to actuate the motor creating the waves when photosynthetic use of carbon dioxide rises above pH to 7.5 and the wave generator remains on until the pH is lowered to 6.5. The container underneath the algae has heat exchanging cooling coils attached to a commercial water cooler and pump, allowing temperature control of the water below the suspended sleeve to culture each species at its optimum temperature. Experiments are run for four days, with daily removal of samples, and measurements of cell density. The volume of algae to remove with the subsequent addition of an equal volume of fresh medium is calculated to return to the starting cell density. The algae and cyanobacteria that were wave mixed grew at near maximal rate with nearly the best yields achievable with bubbling C02. Static, control cultivated algae, cultured without wave motion failed to grow. Example 2 Larger Scale Pilot Experimental Proof of Concept, Choice of Best Plastics The same design with somewhat more sophisticated apparatus is tested on a large scale with parallel modules. Each module is a partially sunken 40 cm ca. 1×2 meter tub (inflatable childrens' pools). The photobioreactors are tethered to the sides of the tubs at water level with flexible cords, to allow waves to mix the algae. Wave generators having adjustable wave amplitude, wave frequency, and period are used, similar to FIG. 3. The wave generators are mounted in one module at short end, in one module along one side of the long side, in one module on both short sides, and in one module on both long ends. This allows generating all wave forms and measuring their damping over distance, with various types of synchrony and asynchrony to determine the most energy efficient ways of transferring carbon dioxide from the airspace to the algae containing medium. Algal photosynthesis is tested at various temperatures of the subtending water, knowing that the solubility of carbon dioxide decreases at higher temperatures. More sensitive pH measuring and wave actuating equipment is installed in these photobioreactors than that in Example 1 to decrease the periods between wave actuation, while keeping the number of waves approximately the same. This narrowing of pH span to (in most cases) pH 6.8-6.5 for on/off also facilitates better continuous suspension of the algae. To the standard 0.5 mm slightly narrower plastic bottom are welded various plastic sheeting as top: 1. Standard non-toxic sheetings of various laminated plastics, with an anti-ultraviolet coating to protect the top plastic. 2. Similar plastics but specially designed to have a low beta value; i.e. pass oxygen preferentially over passing carbon dioxide. 3. Similar plastics but with an infrared reflective coating. 4. Similar plastics with diffusive (non-reflective) outer coatings that transmit low and early morning/late afternoon light to the algae. 5. Similar plastics with anti-droplet inner coatings, to prevent droplet formation that reflects incoming light. 6. Dust repellent plastics. 7. Combinations of the above. In addition to the pH electrode in the medium (which basically measures carbon dioxide in the medium), oxygen and carbon dioxide measuring electrodes are inserted in the air space, allowing direct measure of photosynthesis. In this configuration, there was no continuous C02 input and gas phase bleeding as in Example 1, the supply is discontinuous based on the measurements. An automatic sampling system removes samples at timed intervals and reads absorbancy at 650 and 735 nm, which measures algal growth, and an increase in the ratio 735/650 nm indicates microbial contamination and/or cell breakage. Information from all the sensors/samples as well as on/off timing of the wave generators, together with incident light, temperature and algal density measures all go into a multichannel data logger for further analysis, optimization during experimental runs, and future design considerations. Ultimately the results assist in deciding optimal harvest timing; daily or more than once during the day to best harvest solar energy. The sensor signals when the cultures have increased by the pre-programmed density increase, the oxygen vent is briefly closed and the harvest valve opened and a portion of the algae removed under the increased air-pressure, the vent reopened and an equal volume of fresh medium is introduced. The same harvesting technology is used in the further experiments. While higher plants stop photosynthesis when air contains >30% oxygen, this is not so with algae cultivated at a high pC02. It is necessary to ascertain the level of oxygen each species can withstand at high C02 before it is necessary to vent the airspace, and whether low beta plastics presently available will rapidly enough pass oxygen. This system allows optimizing parameters for when pure carbon dioxide is used (as from separation from natural gas before liquification to liquefied natural gas). Inputs of 4% C02 in air (similar to flue gas from natural gas burning plants) and a mixture of 14% C02, (6% oxygen, 80% nitrogen) representing purified flue gas from coal fired power plants are also tested, as this what is available at some locales. No single plastic is optimal in all culture and economic situations. UV coatings lengthen the use life and increase the cost of the plastic. In cases where short half-life plastics are more economical or desirable for other reasons, then the added cost for UV protection is unwarranted. Where cooling is cheap and/or high temperature optimum algae or cyanobacteria are used, the partial concomitant loss of some photosynthetically active light and added cost with infrared reflecting plastics may be contra-indicated. Dust repellent plastics are unnecessary in areas of high rainfall but near imperative in dusty deserts. Thus, the results from the plastic study are applied for different locales. Similarly, the results from different types of wave motion allow optimization for different species and growing systems. Larger size species require more mixing energy to remain suspended; high amplitude waves can cause light to hit open areas if the algal layer is too shallow; but the more shallow the layer the better the C02 diffusion and more dense the algal suspension that can be cultivated. The timing between the wave pulses and wave amplitude are experimentally determined to ascertain the optimal time and amplitude to set the wave generators such that shear waves are generated that mix the algae layer. These shear waves increase the gas-algae interface, facilitating efficient gas exchange between the air space and the algae growth medium, decreasing the amount of energy that needs to be expended to dissolve carbon dioxide from the air space to the media, and remove excess dissolved oxygen from the media. Likewise, there is no single preferred depth of heat exchanging water beneath the photobioreactors for all uses. In areas with cool nights a greater depth is useful as sufficient heat from the day can be stored to keep the algae warm at night and require less cooling water during the day; algae that are warm at dawn begin active photosynthesis earlier during the day and can buffer the need for adding cooler water due to the cool nights. Also, the difference between the temperature of the water available for cooling and optimum temperature for algal growth (which is species specific and can be genetically modified) must be compared for deciding water depth. The results indicate a considerable saving in capital costs (compressors, aerators, superstructure) over other closed systems, with the present bioreactor invention. There are even more projected savings in running costs; less sterilized medium, better cooling, less carbon dioxide wasted. Example 3 Finned Bottom Photobioreactors The photobioreactors in this example are identical to those in Example 2, except that flexible plastic fins are attached to the bottom plastic as described in FIGS. 4 and 5. The fins are wiggled by the waves such that they amplify the effect of the waves by wiggling or fluttering the bottom plastic of the photobioreactor. Different photobioreactor fin heights, lengths and distances between fins are checked, and the results costed as fabrication costs vs. energy saving, which will be different for different locations and different for different algal. The distance between the fins is experimentally determined to ascertain the optimal distances such that shear waves are generated that mix the algae layer. These shear waves that form increase the gas-algae interface, facilitating efficient gas exchange between the air space and the algae growth medium, lessening the amount of energy that needs to be expended to dissolve carbon dioxide from the air space to the media, and remove excess dissolved oxygen from the media. The fins can be solid or hollow, and will have the added advantage of overcoming sag at the middle of the TLPBR due to the weight of the plastic, the algae, and the slight pressure inflicted by the minor pressure in the air-space. Using hollow fins adds to the buoyancy and to their strength. Example 4 Wave Generation by Piezoelectric Activated Wires Piezoelectric devices are amongst the most energy efficient manner of generating vibrations. Miniature vibrations in a thin layer of medium can be sufficient to execute the gas exchange of C02 from the air space to the medium. In this case wave motion is not needed and the subtending water will just serve as a temperature stabilizer and not a mechanical mixer as well. Piezoelectric wires are embedded into the laminated bottom plastic at various distances during plastic sheet fabrication (FIG. 6A) or single transducers are embedded inside (FIG. 6B) or attached beneath the photobioreactor (not shown). Otherwise, the photobioreactor construction is the same as in Example 2. The algae are introduced into the photobioreactors as a dense suspension in a thin layer of 2.5-5 mm, except for a slightly sunken chamber made for the tip of the pH electrode. Experiments in these photobioreactors must be undergone for a long duration to ascertain the effect of the vibrations on the various plastics. A similar long-term experiment is set up with the photobioreactor resting on piezoelectric wires and not embedded in the plastic. The wires are activated with different energies to vary the amplitude of the mini waves formed in the algal layer. The wires can be stretched the width of the bioreactors and be held taut to prevent sag and keep the bioreactor level. Not all the vibrational energy will be expended in the thin layer of algae. Some of the vibrational energy will be expended in the subtending cooling water, and by doing so, facilitates heat exchange. The results vary from alga to alga, with different layer thicknesses and energies optimal in different cases. The value of this system will depend on the cost of large scale production of wire embedded plastic sheeting or the alternative external wires vs. the energy savings compared to waves, as well as the value of the cultivated algae. The timing of the pulses applied to the piezo-electric actuated wires or separate transducers is set such that they generate shear waves that mix the algae layer. These shear waves that form increase the gas-algae interface, facilitating efficient gas exchange between the air space and the algae growth medium. Example 5 Wave Generation by Mini-Vibrators Attached to the Bottom Plastic Mini-vibrators devices are highly energy efficient in generating vibrations. Miniature vibrations in a thin layer of medium can be sufficient to execute the gas exchange of C02 from the air space to the medium. In this case wave motion is not needed and the subtending water will just serve as a temperature stabilizer and not a mechanical mixer as well. The mini-vibrators mini-vibrators and their electrical feedwires are embedded into the laminated bottom plastic at various distances during plastic sheet fabrication (FIG. 7), glued to the underside of the photobioreactors (FIG. 8A). Otherwise, the photobioreactor construction is the same as in Example 4. The algae are introduced into the photobioreactors at 2-4 times the density but to a thin layer of 2.5-5 mm, except that a slightly sunken chamber is made for the tip of the pH electrode. Experiments in these photobioreactors must be undergone for a long duration to ascertain the effect of the vibrations on the plastic. Not all the vibrational energy will be expended in the thin layer of algae. Some of the vibrational energy will be expended in the subtending cooling water, and by doing so, facilitates heat exchange. The results vary from algae to algae, with different layer thicknesses and energies optimal in different cases. The value of this system will depend on the cost of large scale production of the vibrators and their wires embedded in the plastic sheeting vs. the energy savings compared to waves, as well as the value of the cultivated algae. The timing of a single mini-vibrator operation is set such that the traversing of a wave over it results in the intensification and rarefication of the algae layer by causing shear waves. These shear waves that form increase the gas-algae interface, facilitating efficient gas exchange between the air space and the algae growth medium. The process is detailed in FIG. 7 in which the device activation is timed when it is traversed by a sonic pulse wave and so does produce the shear waves and turbulent vortices that promote gas-algae mixing. Example 6 Wave Generation by Mini-Vibrators Attached in U-Shaped Plastic Profile Support Rods Mini-vibrators devices are highly energy efficient in generating vibrations. Miniature vibrations in a thin layer of medium can be sufficient to execute the gas exchange of C02 from the air space to the medium. In this case wave motion is not needed and the subtending water will just serve as a temperature stabilizer and not a mechanical mixer as well. The mini-vibrators and their electrical feed wires are embedded into U shaped plastic profiles (similar to those used for external electrical conduits mounted on walls) with polystyrene filling the rest of the space in the profiles, such that the profiles are lighter than water. The profiles are mounted under the laminated bottom plastic at various distances, providing a leveling effect, preventing sag (FIG. 8B). Otherwise, the photobioreactor construction is the same as in Example 4. The algae are introduced into the photobioreactors at 2-4 times the density but to a thin layer of 2.5-5 mm, except that a slightly sunken chamber is made for the tip of the pH electrode. Experiments in these photobioreactors must be undergone for a long duration to ascertain the effect of the vibrations on the plastic. The timing and spacing of operation of adjacent mini-vibrators is either pre-set such that the traversing of a wave over them results in the intensification and rarefication of the algae layer by causing shear waves (FIG. 8B), or hydrophones are mounted that provide the localized feedback to provide the same effect (FIGS. 8C and 8D). These shear waves that form increase the gas-algae interface, and thus facilitate efficient gas exchange between the air space and the algae growth medium. Not all the vibrational energy will be expended in the thin layer of algae. Some of the vibrational energy will be expended in the subtending cooling water, and by doing so, facilitates heat exchange. The results vary from algae to algae, with different layer thicknesses and energies optimal in different cases. The value of this system will depend on the cost of large scale production of the vibrators and their wires embedded in the plastic sheeting vs. the energy savings compared to waves, as well as the value of the cultivated algae. An estimation of the relative cost advantage over other photobioreactor configurations for a one hectare (see Table 5 below) and 100 hectare (see Table 6 below) facilities clearly show the economic superiority of the system.

Biotechnology Advances 29 (2011) 24-27 Example 7 Preventing Photobioreactor Sag with Buoyant Subtending Enclosed Bubbles An additional method of preventing the sag caused by the slight positive air pressure used to create the air space as well as by the weight of mini-vibrators or piezo electrically activated wires, as an alternative to the rigid fins (Example 3) or rigid profiles (Example 6) is to attach strips of bubbled plastic sheeting at appropriate intervals on the underside of the lower sheet. These are attached such that the distances are sufficient to maintain a near level surface for algal cultivation in the photobioreactor, but sufficiently apart so as not to overly impede heat exchange with the subtending water (FIG. 9). Wave generation by vibratory rocking of a rigid-bottom An alternative to the very efficient transducer or mini-vibrator induced waves to promote algae-gas mixing, which is less dependent upon complex electronic controls is by vibratory rocking of a rigid bottom photobioreactor. Such rocking chemical solutions is a known process in photographic plate processing and development. Its application to large scale algae gas mixing in a thin film bioreactor is novel. The increase area in the between the C02 gas and the alga slurry caused by the traversing wave should allow more gas to be absorbed by the algae. This configuration is realizable by making the—photobioreactor structure more rigid with a truss like structure, supporting the truss structure at its center to form a fulcrum and installing counter moving actuators at the ends of the truss. Enhancement of the gas-algae interface within the photobioreactor is achieved by vertical flexible pegs resembling a fakir's bed in the photobioreactor sump. The amplitude range of the rocking at the photobioreactor ends is about twice the thickness of the algae slurry layer. The rocking frequency is set to promote a wave that dampens considerably when it reaches the opposite side so as not to form a standing wave or waves in the slurry. The truss that traverses the ventral side of the photobioreactor basin is made of rigid plastic tubing enclosed in U shaped channels which are then fashioned into the truss beam, or by using 1-3 mm thick sheets plastic (e.g. recycled polycarbonate) with molded ridges to enhance rigidity. The rocking configuration is described schematically in FIG. 10. Although the above examples and following descriptions may be directed to one or more certain configurations of thin layer photobioreactor, it should be understood that the present subject matter is not limited to any specific configuration and may be used in various reactors having various geometric shapes that can support or create a thin layer of microalgae floating on a cooling solution, with carbon dioxide mixed into the medium by wave motion, without the need for bubbling of carbon dioxide. Floatation is maintained by having an air space above the algae, and leveling on the cooling water by taut horizontal wires across the bioreactors and/or attached plastic bubbles in rows the length of the photobioreactor. Production scale photobioreactors can be 3-20 meters but preferably 4-5 meters in width and 5-500 meters or longer (but preferably 15-250) meters in length, constructed from welded plastic sheets with bottom and top sheets having different properties, with spaced grommets welded at fixed intervals for flexible tethering to the sides, and ports inserted for control instrumentation and for introducing media and harvesting. In most embodiments the feed of carbon dioxide to the “air space” is either pure carbon dioxide (e.g. separated from natural gas prior to liquification of the natural gas), which is the preferred source, or detoxified flue gas from coal or gas-fired power generation or other industrial sources containing ca. 4-14% carbon dioxide. Purification is routinely required to remove sulfur compounds, phytotoxic heavy metals, and in some cases hydrocarbons or organic molecules. In the preferred embodiments, the carbon dioxide is mixed by using subtending wave motion generated by a wave machine similar in concept to those used to generate waves in swimming pools (but that generate waves of much lower amplitude) or by piezoelectric operated vibrating wires embedded at fixed distances in or on the lower layer of plastic, by small vibrators attached on the underside of the lower plastic, or by natural wave motion. The wave motion can be augmented by fluttering fins mounted on the underside of the plastic at right angles to the wave motion. The nano piezoelectric wire configuration is used as a power transducer to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. The hard wiring of piezoelectric elements as nano size strands are attached or embedded as an array of orthogonally placed wires forming a grid. By sequentially applying voltages to each submerged piezoelectric wire wave motions are produced whereby the nodes and antinodes (crest and troughs) of the resulting waves have different wavelengths and positions. The dimensions and frequency of the surface waves are varied by varying the sequence of the electrical power signals applied to each piezoelectric wire strand to ascertain the most energy efficient introduction of carbon dioxide from the airspace into the culture medium without damage to the algae. Since strands are orthogonally oriented (i.e. grid like), varying the electric power application sequence to the strands ripples, peaked columns resembling a histogram, eddies, whirlpools, etc, are created. The waves are generated for durations and frequencies such that CO2 brings the pH of the growth medium to pH 6.5-7.5 the optimum range of most algae or cyanobacteria (or to other pH ranges for organisms with other pH optima) by C02 dissolution in the medium from the airspace, as it was demonstrated that the potential rate of photosynthesis is too fast for simple diffusion from the airspace to be sufficient, even at layers of 3-5 mm thickness. In one embodiment the electrical power to supply the mixing can come directly from photovoltaic panels with minimum battery storage needed, as the both the rate of photosynthetically utilized CO2 (and thus need for wave facilitated mixing) and the rate photovoltaic power generation are both dependent solar intensity and thus there will be the greatest power available at peak need time, to supply energy to the DC operating wave generators and medium metering pumps. In the embodiments where waves are artificially generated, the timing and amplitude of the wave pulses can be set such that they generate shear waves that mix the algae layer. These shear waves that form increase the gas-algae interface, facilitating efficient gas exchange between the air space and the algae growth medium. Where natural wave motion is used, the tether lines are tightened or loosened to achieve the same mixing effect. Because there is minimal gas flow out of the system (unlike in photobioreactors with continuous gap bubbling, or “plugs” of waves for movement and venting), there is little loss of water due to evaporation and far less need for adding fresh water to offset salinization. In the on-land embodiments of the technology, the rate of flow of the subtending water is controlled to maintain an optimal (cost-effective) temperature for the algae. The depth of water will vary from climate to climate; with deeper water being used where day/night temperature fluctuations are the greatest; to store heat to keep the algae warmer at night and at optimal photosynthetic temperature from early morning, moving and replacing the least amount of water necessary. When the body of water is a reservoir for drinking water or irrigation, the presence of bioreactors lowers evaporative loss of water, and the lack of light prevents algae and cyanobacteria from proliferating and producing toxins and other undesirable metabolites. 1.
