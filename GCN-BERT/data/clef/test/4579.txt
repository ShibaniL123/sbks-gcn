Step E: 3-(2,4-Difluorophenyl)-1H-thieno[2,3-c]pyrazole-5-carboxylic acid
Ethyl 3-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1H-thieno[2,3-c]pyrazole-5-carboxylate (714.9 mg, 2.319 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (35 mL)/methanol (12 mL) at 25 °C. Sodium hydroxide (9.28 mL, 9.28 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was heated to 50 °C and allowed to stir for 18 h. The reaction was stopped, cooled to room temperature, quenched with concentrated hydrochloric acid (0.767 mL), and concentrated under reduced pressure. The title compound with 4 equivalents of sodium chloride, (1.1613 g, 2.259 mmol, 97 % yield) was recovered as a light yellow/white solid. LC-MS [M+1] = 281.2.
