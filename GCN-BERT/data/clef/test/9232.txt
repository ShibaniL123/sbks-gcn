Embodiment 21A (260.00 mg, 489.09 µmol), (Boc)2O (260.00 mg, 489.09 µmol) and potassium carbonate (101.40 mg, 733.63 µmol) were dissolved in THF (5 mL) and water (1 mL). The mixture was stirred at 25 °C for 12 hours. LCMS showed the reaction was complete and the reaction mixture was diluted with water (10 mL), extracted with EtOAc (30 mL × 2) and the organic layer was concentrated. The crude product was purified by preparative plate (DCM / MeOH = 20: 1) to deliver the title compound 230 mg, yield 71.98%).
