JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT The Salk Institute for Biological Studies and Mitokyne (Boston, ΜΑ) are parties to a joint research agreement for the purposes of performing experimental, developmental, or research work in the field of the claimed invention. BACKGROUND Skeletal muscle is a mechanically and energetically active organ, supporting vital processes such as respiration and locomotion, and is a major site of glucose and lipid metabolism. Therefore, maintaining proper muscle mass and function is critical. Muscle incurs damage due to a variety of insults such as use, disuse, aging and pathology. While skeletal muscle does not undergo rapid turn-over under normal conditions, upon being damaged, it is capable of executing a robust regenerative response through mobilization of its resident progenitor cells, the satellite cells (Moss FP, Leblond CP, AnatRec 170:421-436 (1970); Schultz Ε, Gibson MC, Champion Τ, J Exp Ζοοℓ 206(3):451 -6 (1978); Snow ΜΗ, Cell Tissue Res 186(3):535-40 (1978)). The self-renewal and differentiation capacity of the satellite cells have alluded to the archetypic “sternness,” but their fate seems largely committed (Sinanan ACM, Buxton PG, Lewis ΜΡ, Bio Cell 98:203-214 (2006); Beauchamp JR et al., J Cell Biol 151:1221-1234 (2000); Starkey JD et al., J Histochem Cytochem 59(1):33-46 (2011)). In an adult, satellite cells comprise less than 5% of total nuclei on a myofiber; nevertheless, based on their proliferation kinetics and capacity, this is sufficient to regenerate an entire muscle (Schmalbruch Η, Hellhammer U, AnatRec 189:169-176 (1977); Kelly AM, Dev Bio 65(1): 1-10 (1978); Gibson MC, Schultz Ε , AnatRec 202(3):329-337 (1982); Bischoff R in Myology, Vol 1, eds Engel AG, Franzini-Armstrong C (McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York), (1994); Zammit PS et al., Exp Cell Res 281:39-49 (2002)). Upon injury, skeletal muscle responds to damage in three distinct but overlapping phases: degeneration, regeneration and finally remodeling (Charge SBP, Rudnicki ΜΑ, Physiol Rev 84:209-238 (2004)). Immediately following the injury, inflammatory cells are recruited to the injury site to promote degeneration of the damaged tissue through necrosis and phagocytosis (Tidball JG, Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physio 288:R345-353 (2005); McLennan IS, J Anat 188:17-28 (1996); Pimorady-Esfahani A, Grounds MD, McMenamin PG, Muscle Nerve 20:158-166 (1997); Vierck J et al., Cell Bio Int 24:263-272 (2000); Arnold L et al., J Exp Med 204(5):1057-1069 (2007)). The subsequent regenerative phase is characterized by mobilization of satellite cells, whereby the progenitor cells proliferate, differentiate and fuse to each other or to the existing fibers to regenerate the muscle (Zammit PS in Skeletal muscle repair and regeneration, eds Schiaffino S, Partridge Τ (Springer, Dordrecht (2008)). Finally, the contractile proteins are reassembled and function is restored during the remodeling phase.

Method of Making the Compounds Disclosed compounds can be prepared to the carboxylic acid or hydroxamic acid at L1 respectively, as exemplified below and as will be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art of organic synthesis. For the preparation of the corresponding salts, an additional step would be performed. An exemplary synthesis may include the following 1st reaction step: An alkylation reaction, specifically an etherification reaction, is performed where a hydroxyaryl or hydroxyheteroaryl moiety is reacted with an alkylating agent. For the hydroxyaryl or hydroxyheteroaryl moiety, the ring atoms are CRA or Ν; and RA is selected from Η, D, F, Cl, lower aliphatic or alkyl, -CD3, CF3, -OH, -OCH3, -OCD3 or -OCF3. A suitable exemplary alkylating agent is an alkyl bromide Ri-O- F1(CO)F2-Br. The reactants are combined in the presence of a molar excess of a carbonate base (e.g. Μ = Na, Κ or Cs). The reaction is carried out in a polar aprotic solvent with a boiling point >100 °C such as DMF, DMA or DME. Typical reaction concentrations are 0.1 to 1.0Μ. Reactants are heated to >100 °C, under ambient or elevated pressure, such as with microwave assisted organic synthesis (MAOS), for a period of time ranging from minutes to hours until both reactants are consumed.

Generally the distance between the bromide and the carbonyl carbon is 4-8 carbon-carbon bond lengths. Isolation, purification and characterization of the product aldehyde would be consistent with that typically practiced by one of ordinary skill in the art.

L3 can be -Η, -D, -CEE, aliphatic, typically alkyl, and more typically lower alkyl. The reaction conditions are performed so that monoalkylation is the major product and over alkylation to the tertiary amine is suppressed. Reducing agents and co-solvent reaction additives are numerous, but readily known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

The 3rd reaction step is generally characterized as a secondary amine acylation reaction. Exemplary acylating reagents include 4-bromobenzoyl or 4-bromoheteroaryoyl compounds. X typically is a leaving group, such as F, Cl, OTf, or similar favorable leaving group. 0 Λ ..10 R* ''-r 0 °yl,> l2s Of 3ν „L‘ ,R, Υ 0 V 0 if 0 Ν Η5 Q τ Ν Η 1 j Η ν W... ...2 base, xs soJvent, a, t Ο „0 ,ai * Υ Α¾ A3 . , Α0 Ai Bf Ο Ο 0 χ Ν A Q 0 Χ,α,, Q γ Ν A i [j I I ’ S j L* '1 Af W„ „Z ℓΛ.

Solvents typically are chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as CH2CI2, CHCI3, or 1,2-dichloroethane. Reaction temperature and reaction time vary depending on the reaction temperature selected. As described above, MAOS versions of secondary amine acylation exist. The 4* reaction step is generally characterized as a biaryl, aryl-heteroaryl or heteroaryl-heteroaryl coupling reaction mediated catalytically by a transition metal or transition metal complex.

Β. Excipients and Dosage Forms The present disclosure provides pharmaceutical compositions that include a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of one or more disclosed compounds (such as 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 disclosed compounds) in admixture with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable material, such as an excipient. Disclosed pharmaceutical compositions include a detectable amount of the PPAR agonist, such as greater than 0% to less than 100%, such as from 5% to 99%, or from about 50% to about 99%, or from 25% to about 99% by weight of the PPAR agonist of the present disclosure. Disclosed compositions can be administered in any suitable dosage form, such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, auto-injector devices or suppositories. The compositions are intended for any suitable administration route, including oral, parenteral, intranasal, sublingual, rectal, transdermal, inhalation or insufflation. The compositions may be formulated by methods known by those of ordinary skill in the art, such as described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (15th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania, 1980). The compositions can be administered for therapeutic or prophylactic treatments. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a subject suffering from a disease (e.g., a PPAR8 related disease) in a "therapeutically effective dose." Amounts effective for this use can depend upon the severity of the disease and the general state of the subject's health. Single or multiple administrations of the compositions can be administered depending on the dosage and frequency as required and tolerated by the subject. Also, the composition, shape, and type of dosage forms may vary depending on their use. For example, a dosage form used for acute treatment of a disease or disorder may contain larger amounts of the active ingredient than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment of the same disease or disorder. Similarly, a parenteral dosage form may contain smaller amounts of the active ingredient than an oral dosage form. Oral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, tablets (including without limitation scored or coated tablets), pills, granules, lozenges, caplets, capsules, chewable tablets, powder packets, cachets, troches, wafers, aerosol sprays, mucosal patches, or liquids, such as syrups, elixirs, solutions or suspensions in an aqueous liquid, for example water or saline, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil emulsion. Typical oral dosage forms may be prepared by combining the pharmaceutically acceptable PPAR agonist, potentially in a a liquid, solid, granule or gelatin for and/or in a salt form, in admixture with at least one excipient including, but are not limited to, surface stabilizers, dispersion aids, binders, filling agents, lubricating agents, glidants, suspending agents, sweeteners, flavoring agents, preservatives, buffers, wetting agents, disintegrants, effervescent agents, humectants, controlled release agents, absorption accelerators, absorbents, plasticizers, lactose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, calcium phosphates, com starch, potato starch, cellulose, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, tragacanth, guar gum, gelatin, colloidal silicon dioxide, talc, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, colorants, diluents, talc, calcium carbonate, kaslin, maltodextrin, polymethacrylates, moistening agents, preservatives, dyes, and any combination thereof. Disintegrants facilitate producing tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. The amount of disintegrant used varies based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration, and is readily determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art. Typical pharmaceutical compositions comprise from about 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, such as from about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant. Disintegrants include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, guar gum, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, carboxymethylcellulose calcium, methylcellulose, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums, and mixtures thereof. Exemplary lubricants include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, com oil, and soybean oil), sodium benzoate, sodium stearylfumarate, zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl laureate, agar, syloid silica gel, synthetic silica, and mixtures thereof. Lubricants typically are used in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical compositions. Disclosed PPAR agonists, and related forms, such as salts, can be administered as controlled- or delayed-release formulations. Controlled-release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled release counterparts. These dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, alginic acid, aliphatic polyesters, bentonite, cellulose acetate, phthalate, camuba wax, chitosan, ethylcellulose, guar gum, microcrystalline wax, paraffin, polymethacrylates, povidone, xanthan gum, yellow wax, carbomers, hydroxypropylcellulose, and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. Pharmaceutical compositions can also include large, slowly metabolized macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, such as chitosan, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids and copolymers (such as latex functionalized sepharose(TM), agarose, cellulose, and the like), polymeric amino acids, amino acid copolymers, and lipid aggregates (such as oil droplets or liposomes). Additionally, these carriers can function as immunostimulating agents (i.e., adjuvants). The compositions provided herein, alone or in combination with other suitable components, can be made into aerosol formulations (e.g., they can be "nebulized") to be administered via inhalation. Aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen, and the like. Suitable formulations for rectal administration include, for example, suppositories. Exemplary suppositories include a suppository base, such as natural or synthetic triglycerides or paraffin hydrocarbons. Gelatin rectal capsules include a combination of the compound of choice with a base, including, for example, liquid triglycerides, polyethylene glycols, and paraffin hydrocarbons. Topical dosage forms include, but are not limited to, creams, lotions, ointments, gels, shampoos, sprays, aerosols, solutions, emulsions, and other forms know to a person of ordinary skill in the art. Suitable formulations include, without limitation, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, creams, ointments, powders, liniments, and salves. Transdermal and mucosal dosage forms can include, but are not limited to, ophthalmic solutions, patches, sprays, aerosols, creams, lotions, suppositories, ointments, gels, solutions, emulsions, or suspensions. Dosage forms suitable for treating mucosal tissues within the oral cavity can be formulated as mouthwashes, as oral gels, or as buccal patches. The disclosed PPAR agonists can be formulated for parenteral administration, such as, for example, by intraarticular (in the joints), intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intratumoral, intradermal, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous routes. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, solutions ready for injection, dry products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection, suspensions ready for injection, and emulsions. In addition, controlled-release parenteral dosage forms can be prepared. Suitable materials for such administration include sterile water; saline solution; glucose solution; aqueous vehicles, such as sodium chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose, Sodium Chloride Injection, Lactated Ringer's Injection; ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and propylene glycol; non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, com oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate; aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which can contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. In the practice of this disclosure, compositions can be administered, for example, by intravenous infusion, orally, topically, intraperitoneally, intravesically or intrathecally. In an independent embodiment, parenteral administration, oral administration, and/or intravenous administration are the methods of administration. The formulations of compounds can be presented in unit-dose or multidose sealed containers, such as ampules and vials. The pharmaceutical preparation can be in unit dosage form. In such form the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packaged tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. The combined administrations contemplate coadministration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order, wherein, in some embodiments, there is a time period while both (or all) active agents simultaneously exert their biological activities. The particular mode of administration and the dosage regimen will be selected by the attending clinician, taking into account the particulars of the case (e.g. the subject, the disease, the disease state involved, the particular treatment, and whether the treatment is prophylactic). Treatment can involve daily or multi-daily or less than daily (such as weekly or monthly etc.) doses over a period of a few days to months, or even years. For example, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds disclosed herein can be administered in a single dose, twice daily, weekly, or in several doses, for example daily such as two, three or four times daily, or during a course of treatment. The disclosed PPAR agonists may be administered substantially continuously too, such as by using a transdermal delivery system. In a particular non-limiting example, treatment involves once daily dose or twice daily dose. However, a person of ordinary skill in the art would immediately recognize appropriate and/or equivalent doses looking at dosages of approved compositions for treating a PPAR8 related disease using the disclosed PPAR agonists for guidance. The pharmaceutical compositions that include one or more compounds disclosed herein can be formulated in unit dosage form, suitable for individual administration of precise dosages. In one ηοηlimiting example, a unit dosage contains from about 1 mg to about 50 g of one or more compounds disclosed herein, such as about 10 mg to about 10 g, about 100 mg to about 10 g, about 100 mg to about 7 g, about 200 mg to about 10 g, or about 200 mg to about 5 g. In other examples, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds disclosed herein is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg, for example, about 0.5 mg/kg to about 500 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, or about 1 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg. In other examples, a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds disclosed herein is from about 1 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg, such as about 2 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg. In some embodiments, about 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg can be used. V. Methods Provided herein are methods of activating PPAR5. Such methods can include contacting a PPAR5 protein with an effective amount of a compound or composition provided herein, thereby activating PPAR5. In some embodiments, the contacting is performed in vitro. In other embodiments, the contacting is performed within a subject, such as a human subject, for example by administering a PPAR agonist disclosed herein to the subject. In some embodiments, the compound or composition is administered ton a healthy subject. In some embodiments, the subject is a sedentary or immobilized subject. In other embodiments, the subject is an exercising subject, such as one who exercises for at least 20 minutes, at least 30 mintues, at least 45 mintures, or at least 60 minutes, at least 2, at least 3, or at least 4 days per week. In some embodiments, a healthy subject is also an exercising subject. In some examples, contacting a PPAR5 protein in vitro or in vivo with an effective amount of one or more compounds or compositions provided herein, increases PPAR8 activity by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 100%, at least 200%, at least 300%, at least 400%, or even at least 500%, for example as compared to an amount of PPAR5 activity in the absence of the compound/composition. Methods of measuring PPAR8 activity are known, and specific examples are provided herein (e.g., measuring expression of PPAR8 at the protein or nucleic acid level, measuring Beta oxidation levels, creatine kinase levels, pentose phosphate shunt in liver, blood glucose levels and methods provided in Wang et αℓ., PLos Biol. 2(10):℮294, 2004 and Lee et αℓ., PNAS 103:3444-9,2006). In some embodiments, the subject recovers from acute injury following administration of the PPAR agonist. In some embodiments, activating PPAR5 within the subject by administration of a PPAR agonist disclosed herein (or composition containing the PPAR agonist) increases or maintains muscle mass or muscle tone (such as a skeletal or cardiac muscle) in the subject (such as in a healthy subject or a sedentary subject). For example, activating PPAR5 within the subject can increase muscle mass, muscle tone, or both, in the subject. In some examples, administering an effective amount of one or more PPAR agonist compounds or compositions provided herein increases muscle mass, muscle tone, or both, by at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 100%, at least 200%, at least 300%, at least 400%, or even at least 500%, for example as compared to an amount of PPAR5 activity in the absence of the compound/composition. Methods of measuring muscle mass and muscle tone are known, and specific examples are provided herein (e.g., see methods provided in WO 2009/086526). In other embodiments, activating PPAR5 within the subject (such as a healthy subject or a sedentary subject) maintains muscle mass, muscle tone, or both, in the subject. In some examples, administering an effective amount of one or more PPAR agonist compounds or compositions provided herein maintains muscle mass, muscle tone, or both, such that the amount of muscle mass, muscle tone or both, does not change by more than 1%, for example no more than 2%, no more than 3%, no more than 4%, no more than 5%, no more than 6%, no more than 7%, no more than 8%, no more than 9%, no more than 10%, or no more than 15%, for example as compared to an amount of muscle mass, muscle tone, or both in the absence of the compound/composition. Methods of measuring muscle mass and muscle tone are known, and specific examples are provided herein (e.g., see methods provided in WO 2009/086526). Thus, the disclosed PPAR agonists and compositions containing such can be used to increase or maintain muscle mass or muscle tone (or both) in a subject. For example, the disclosed PPAR agonists and compositions containing such can be used to increase or maintain muscle mass or muscle tone (or both) in a subject following an injury, following a period of immobilization (for example confinement to a bed or wheelchair) or immobilization of a body part (for example immobilization of an appendage or joint due to a broken bone, joint replacement, tendon tear, surgery, and the like), which events can result in a loss of muscle mass and/or muscle tone. The method includes administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds provided herein. In some embodiments, the subject is a sedentary or immobilized subject. In other embodiments, the subject is an exercising subject. Methods of treating or preventing a PPAR5-related disease or condition in a subject in need thereof are provided. The methods can include administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds or compositions provided herein. In some embodiments, the PPAR5-related disease is a vascular disease (such as a cardiovascular disease or any disease that would benefir from increasing vascularization in tissues exhibiting impaired or inadequate blood flow). In other embodiments, the PPAR5-related disease is a muscular disease, such as a muscular dystrophy. Examples of muscular dystrophy include but are not limited to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, myotonic muscular dystrophy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, distal muscular dystrophy, and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. In some embodiments, the PPAR5-related disease or condition is a demyelinating disease, such as multiple sclerosis, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, encephalomyelitis, neuromyelitis optica, adrenoleukodystrophy, or Guillian-Barre syndrome. In some embodiments, the PPARb-related disease is a metabolic disease. Examples of metabolic diseases include but are not limited to obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperlipidemia, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, Syndrome X, and Type II diabetes mellitus. Other PPARb-related diseases that can be treated or prevented with the disclosed PPAR agonists (or compositions containing such compound), include but are not limited to one or more of the following diseases: (1) a muscle structure disorder, such as Bethlem myopathy, central core disease, congenital fiber type disproportion, distal muscular dystrophy (MD), Duchenne & Becker MD, Emery-Dreifuss MD, facioscapulohumeral MD, hyaline body myopathy, limb-girdle MD, a muscle sodium channel disorders, myotonic chondrodystrophy, myotonic dystrophy, myotubular myopathy, nemaline body disease, oculopharyngeal MD, and stress urinary incontinence; (2) a neuronal activation disorder, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Lambert-Eaton syndrome, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, nerve lesion, peripheral neuropathy, spinal muscular atrophy, tardy ulnar nerve palsy, toxic myoneural disorder, (3) a muscle fatigue disorder such as chronic fatigue syndrome, diabetes (type I or II), glycogen storage disease, fibromyalgia, Friedreich’s ataxia, intermittent claudication, lipid storage myopathy, MELAS, mucopolysaccharidosis, Pompe disease, thyrotoxic myopathy, (4) a muscle mass disorder such as, cachexia, cartilage degeneration, cerebral palsy, compartment syndrome, critical illness myopathy, inclusion body myositis, muscular atrophy (disuse), sarcopenia, steroid myopathy, and systemic lupus erythematosus, (5) a mitochondrial disease such as, Alpers's Disease, CPEO-Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia , Keams-Sayra Syndrome (KSS), Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON), MELAS-Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes, MERRF-Myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fiber disease, NARP-neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa, and Pearson Syndrome, (6) a beta oxidation disease such as, systemic carnitine transporter, carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) II deficiency, very long-chain acyl- CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD or VLCAD) deficiency, trifunctional enzyme deficiency, medium - chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, short - chain acyl- CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency, riboflavin - responsive disorders of [1-oxidation (RR -MADD), (7) a metabolic disease such as, hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, hyperchlolesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, HDL hypocholesterolemia, LDL hypercholesterolemia and/or HLD non-cholesterolemia, VLDL hyperproteinemia, dyslipoproteinemia, apolipoprotein A-I hypoproteinemia, atherosclerosis, disease of arterial sclerosis, disease of cardiovascular systems, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral circulatory disease, metabolic syndrome, syndrome X, obesity, diabetes (type I or II), hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinism, diabetic complication, cardiac insufficiency, cardiac infarction, cardiomyopathy, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), thrombus, Alzheimer disease, neurodegenerative disease, demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis, adrenal leukodystrophy, dermatitis, psoriasis, acne, skin aging, trichosis, inflammation, arthritis, asthma, hypersensitive intestine syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and pancreatitis, (8) a cancer such as, cancer of the colon, large intestine, skin, breast, prostate, ovary, or lung; (9) a vascular disease such as peripheral vascular insufficiency, peripheral vascular disease, intermittent claudication, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD), and peripheral obliterative arteriopathy; (10) an ocular vascular disease such as, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), stargardt disease, hypertensive retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy , macular degeneration, retinal haemorrhage, or glaucoma; or (11) a muscular eye disease such as, strabismus (crossed eye/wandering eye/walleye ophthalmoparesis), progressive external ophthalmoplegia, esotropia, exotropia, a disorder of refraction and accommodation, hypermetropia, myopia, astigmatism, anisometropia, presbyopia, a disorders of accommodation, or internal ophthalmoplegia. Thus, in some examples, the subject treated has or is at risk for developing one or more of these dieases. VI. Working Examples Skeletal muscle relies on the resident progenitor cells, the satellite cells, for postnatal growth and regeneration. Therefore, maintaining an adequate number and proper function of satellite cells is critical for muscle to appropriately response to damage. While endurance exercise promotes adaptive responses in the muscle, including an increase in the satellite cell number, it is not known whether transcriptionally directed “endurance exercise training” has similar effects. Here it is shown that mice harboring constitutively active PPAR5 in skeletal muscle displayed an accelerated regenerative process in muscle after an acute injury. Gene expression analyses showed earlier resolution of the inflammatory response and induction of myogenic markers, indicating that PPAR5 activation induces a temporal shift in the regenerative process. Notably, a significant increase in the number of satellite cells was found in mice with constitutively active PPAR5 expressed in skeletal muscle, consistent with the observed increase in proliferating cell number after the injury. PPAR8 activation induced the expression of FGF1, which is known to be involved in muscle development and regeneration. In particular, PPAR8 up-regulates FGFla isoform, which may be responsible for supporting cell proliferation and reestablishment of vasculature to augment the regenerative process. Furthermore, the restoration of fiber integrity was improved in wild-type mice after acute treatment with the PPAR8 synthetic ligand, GW501516. Collectively, these findings allude to the therapeutic potential of PPAR5, to accelerate the recovery from acute muscle injury. Activation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor δ (PPAR8) induces a fiber type switch toward a more oxidative phenotype, altering both metabolic and functional output of the muscle (Wang et al., PLoS Biol 2(10):℮294. Erratum in: PLoS Biol. 2005 Jan;3(l):e61 (2004); Luquet et αℓ., FASEB J 17(15):2299-2301 (2003)). Specifically, PPAR6-mediated muscle remodeling translates into supernatural physical endurance, and protection against diet-induced obesity and symptoms of metabolic disorders that ensue (Wang et al., PLoS Biol 2(10):℮294. Erratum in: PLoS Biol. 2005 Jan;3(l):e61 (2004); Wang et αℓ., Cell 113:159-170 (2003)). Furthermore, pharmacological activation of PPAR6 and exercise training synergistically enhance oxidative fibers and running endurance (Narkar VA etal., Cell 134(3):405-415 (2008)). Exercise confers a myriad of healthful benefits to the body, including improvement of atrophic and disease conditions (Nicastro et αℓ., BrazJ Med Biol Res 44(11): 1070-9 (2011); Markert et αℓ., Muscle Nerve 43(4):464-78 (2011)). Recently, endurance exercise alone has been shown to improve ageing induced decrease in satellite cell number and their myogenic capacity (Shefer et αℓ., PLoS One 5(10):℮13307 (2010)). It is demonstrated herein that both genetic and pharmacological activation of PPAR8 promote muscle regeneration in an acute thermal injury mouse model. PPAR8 activation during regeneration expedites resolution of inflammatory response and restoration of contractile proteins. Interestingly, acute pharmacological activation of PPAR8 by oral administration of a synthetic ligand, GW501516, is sufficient to confer similar benefits during muscle regeneration after an acute injury. Based on these observations, a novel role of PPAR8 during adult muscle regeneration and its use as a therapeutic target to enhance regenerative efficiency of skeletal muscle is provided. EXAMPLE 1 Experimental Procedures A. Animals VP16-PPAR8 mice (Wang et αℓ., Cell 113:159-170 (2003)) were bred to CB6F1 strain (Jackson Laboratories) and used as heterozygotes in experiments. The non-transgenic littermates served as controls. All experiments were performed when animals were 8 weeks of age. Nestin-GFP mice (Mignone et αℓ., J Comp Neurol 469(3):311-324 (2004)) were kindly provided by Dr. Fred Gage at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. Β. Freeze burn injury ΤΑ muscles were injured according to previously published methods with a few modifications (Brack etal., Science 317(5839):807-810 (2007)). A stainless steel lg weight (Mettler-Toledo) equilibrated to the temperature of dry ice was placed directly on the exposed ΤΑ for 10 seconds. Following the thermal injury, incision was closed using VetBond (3Μ). All injury procedures were performed on the left leg, and the right leg was used as control. C. Histology Animals were perfused with 15 mL of ice-cold PBS followed immediately by 20 mL of 10% saline buffered formalin. ΤΑ muscles were excised and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde for at least 48 hours at 4 °C. Tissues were dehydrated in series of solutions with increasing percentage of ethanol. Dehydrated tissues were cleared in xylene and allowed for paraffin to permeate over night at 60 °C. Tissues were then embedded in plastic molds. Paraffin embedded tissue blocks were sectioned at 7 pm thick on Leica Jung 2500 Microtome. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and counter stained with 1 % eosin. Slides were dried and mounted with Entellan mounting media (EMS). Three random non-overlapping fields were photographed for analysis. Regenerating fiber number was measured by counting the number of discernible muscle fibers with centralized myonuclei (Ge et αℓ., Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 297(6):C1434-1444 (2009)). Regenerating fiber cross sectional area (CSA) was measured using Image J software. D. Evans Blue dye staining Injured animals were injected with Evans Blue dye according published protocol (Hamer et αℓ., J Anat 200(Pt 1):69-79 (2002)). Sterile 1% w/v Evans Blue dye in PBS was intraperitoneally injected at 1% volume relative to the body mass of an animal. 7 hours after the injection, injured ΤΑ muscles were harvested and snap-frozen by isopentane quenching in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections were cut in 1 ()μηΐ thickness, fixed in ice-cold acetone, dipped in xylene and mounted with DPX. Proportion of the stained area over the total area was measured using ImageJ software. Ε. BrdU Labeling 50 mg/kg body weight of BrdU (Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally as solution of 10 mg/mL BrdU in saline. ΤΑ muscles were harvested at 7 days after injury and processed for paraffin sections as described above. BrdU incorporation was visualized using the BrdU Labeling and Detection Kit I (Roche) and BrdU-r nuclei were counted and represented as a proportion of total nuclei in a field. F. RT-QPCR Whole or partial tissues were homogenized by Polytron probe homogenizer in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was extracted from the homogenates according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 1 pg of DNase-treated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNAs were diluted 1/40 with ddHiO and used as templates in RT-QPCR reactions with SYBRGreenER qPCR SuperMix detection system (Invitrogen). Samples were prepared in technical triplicates and relative mRNA levels were calculated by using the standard curve methodology and normalized against GAPDH mRNA levels in the same samples. G. Myofiber Isolation Either whole or partial gastrocnemius muscle was digested in 2% collagenase I (Sigma) in DMEM with 10% FBS for 60 minutes at 37 °C. Muscle tissue was further mechanically digested by triturating with fire polished wide bore Pasteur pipet. Liberated fibers were washed in two changes of PBS with 10%FBS and finally mounted on glass slides with Vectashield mounting media (Vector Labs). Η. Isolation of satellite cells Satellite cells were harvested from ΤΑ of 8 weeks old animals according to published protocols with some modifications (Day et αℓ. (2007) Nestin-GFP reporter expression defines the quiescent state of skeletal muscle satellite cells. Dev Biol 304(1):246-259). Muscles were removed and washed briefly in DMEM on ice. They were then minced to fine slurry with razor blade on 60mm culture dish over ice. Minced muscles were transferred to one well of a 6-well plate containing 5 ml of 450KPU/ml pronase in DMEM. The tissues were digested at 37°C/5% CO2 for 60 minutes. After digestion, tissues were vigorously triturated 20 times through 10ml serological pipet. Digested tissues were filtered through 40 micron cell strainer and washed with equal volume of DMEM with 20% horse serum. Cells were spun down at lOOOg for 10 minutes and resuspended in sorting buffer (DMEM with 10% FBS). Cells were separated from larger debris by 20%/60% Percoll gradient (Yablonka-Reuveni Ζ et αℓ. (1987) Isolation and clonal analysis of satellite cells from chicken pectoralis muscle. Dev Bio 119: 252-259). GFP positive cells were sorted on BD FACSAria Π sorter. EXAMPLE 2 Muscle specific activation of ΡΡΑΚδ confers regenerative advantage While it has been shown that the majority of the metabolic genes are down regulated in this model, PPAR8 expression was induced over 2 fold at 2 days after the injury (Warren et αℓ. (2007) Mechanisms of skeletal muscle injury and repair revealed by gene expression studies in mouse models. J Physiol. 582.2: 825-841, FIG. 1 A). This injury dependent up-regulation of PPAR8 strongly suggested a possible role for PPAR8 during the early part of the regenerative process. Freeze bum injury was used to elicit the regenerative program, which has been shown to model the standard course of regenerative response, including satellite cell activation (Karpati and Molnar. “Muscle fibre regeneration in human skeletal muscle diseases.” In: Schiaffino S, Partridge Τ (eds). Skeletal muscle repair and regeneration. Springer, Dordrecht, 2008). Additionally, since the injury is directly applied to the surface of the muscle, it is highly localized and reproducible. Using Evans Blue dye uptake as a marker of myofiber damage, fiber integrity was histologically assessed. The freeze burn injury does not incapacitate the animals and the damaged fibers restore original cross sectional area by 21 days after the injury (FIG. IB). By comparing the proportion of stained fibers within the cross sectional area (CSA) of the injured muscle 5 days after the injury, the degree of existing damage was quantified. At 5 days after the injury, VP16-PPAR8 (TG) animals show significantly less dye uptake, thus increased fiber intactness, over the wildtype (WT) animals (FIG> 1C). While 14% of the total CSA shows dye uptake, only 5% of the total CSA of TG muscle show dye uptake (η=8 WT; η=5 TG; ρ=0.001) (FIG. ID). At 12 and 36 hours after the injury, however, both WT and TG animals showed similar proportions of stained area (50.6% and 47.4% (ρ=0.67), and 38.5% and 43.3% (ρ=0.23), respectively) (FIGS. IE and IF). Similar level of dye uptake shortly after the injury shows that both WT and TG animals initially sustain similar degree of damage from the injury and suggests that PPAR8 activation does not confer protection from damage. Instead, the reduction in Evans Blue dye uptake observed 5 days after the injury suggests that the muscle specific PPAR8 activation promotes restoration of fiber integrity after the injury. The morphological hallmarks of regenerating fibers was determined for a detailed analysis of the process. H&E stained transverse sections through the injured area were examined at 3, 5 and 7 days post injury. At 3 days after the injury, both WT and TG animals showed similar degrees of degeneration defined as necrosing fibers surrounded by infiltrating monocytes (FIG. 1G). No regenerating fibers, characterized by small, round shape and centralized nuclei, were discernible at this time point in WT animals, but a notable few were seen in TG animals (arrows, FIG. 1G). By day 5 after the injury, obvious differences begin to emerge. In WT animals, small regenerating fibers were visible but necrosing fibers and monocytes were still prevalent at the site of the injury (arrowheads, FIG. 1G). While in the TG animals, the injury site harbors orderly arrangement of small regenerating fibers. Quantification of regenerating fiber number and CSA reveals that by 5 days post injury, TG animals show significant regenerative advantage over their WT counterparts. Both CSA of the regenerating fibers and the number of regenerating fibers were significantly greater for TG animals at 43.5% (η=5 or 6; p<0.03) and 33.0% (η=11 or 12; p<0.001), respectively (FIGS. IB and 1C). By day 7 post injury, the damage site appears architecturally similar between WT and TG animals, where both show a field of immature regenerating fibers without the infiltrating immune cells . However, quantification of the regenerating fibers revealed a regenerative advantage of the TG animals in the number of nascent regenerating fibers (FIG. 1Η). At 21 days after the injury, both WT and TG animals have restored their fiber size and number to that of the uninjured level (FIG. 1J). These data demonstrate that the muscle specific activation of PPAR8 sufficiently bestows regenerative advantage, most prominently observed in the early stages of the regenerative process. EXAMPLE 3 ΡΡΑΚδ activation leads to temporal shift, thus increased efficiency, of the regenerative process Skeletal muscle regeneration is an intricately orchestrated process involving a variety of cell types. For example, immune cells, both neutrophils and macrophages, are necessary for the proper progression of regenerative process (Zacks etal., Muscle Nerve 5:152-161 (1982); Grounds etal., Cell Tissue Res 250:563-569 (1987); Teixeira etal., Muscle Nerve 28(4):449-459 (2003); Summan etal., Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 290:R1488-R1495 (2006); Contreras-Shannon et al.,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 292:C953-967 (2007); Segawa et αℓ., Exp Cell Res 314( 17):3232-3244 (2008)). Additionally, various cytokines are necessary to promote chemotaxis of monocytes and also to directly regulate the activities of myogenic cells (Warren et αℓ., Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 286(5):C1031 -1036 (2004); Yahiaoui et αℓ., J Physiol 586:3991-4004 (2008); Chazaud etal., JCB 163(5): 1133-1143 (2003)). Therefore, the temporal expression profiles of genes associated with various aspects of the regenerative process was determined. Global, injury specific gene expression changes, were identified in VP16-PPAR8 animals by microarray. Comparing the gene expression profiles of injured TG to WT 3 days post-injury, 3257 genes that changed expression pattern, of those, 1375 of them were down regulated and 1882 were up regulated. Interestingly, genes involved in myogenesis and remodeling were robustly up-regulated by PPAR8 activation while those involved in inflammatory response were down regulated in injured TG muscles (FIG. 2A). Additionally, genes involved in developmental processes, angiogenesis and anti-apoptotic processes emerged from the analysis (FIG. 2A). Relative expressions of regeneration markers reveal down-regulation of early makers (inflammatory genes) and up-regulation of regenerative/remodeling genes (myogenic, vascularization, ECM genes) in TG animals 3 days post injury (FIG. 2Β). Collectively, PPAR8 activation appears to control a network of genes involved directly in myogenesis and also in remodeling and repair processes after the injury. Underlying phasic progression of the regenerative program is a temporally coordinated gene expression of a variety of contributing processes (30). In order to validate and temporally expand the microarray data, expression of CD68 (inflammation) and MyoD (myogenesis) were measured by Q-PCR at several time points over 7 days after injury (FIGS. 2C and 2D). A temporal shift in the expression patterns of regenerative markers for TG animals compared to their WT littermates was observed. TG animals showed rapid induction of CD68 whose expressions peaked sooner and were subsequently down regulated earlier than in the WT animals. Interestingly, inflammatory markers studied here peaked at similar levels between the two genotypes, which indicates that TG animals do not completely suppress their inflammatory responses. Instead, it appears that the TG animals respond and resolve their inflammatory responses more efficiently, which is consistent with the accelerated restoration of muscle morphology observed. TG animals also show higher expression of perinatal myosin heavy chain gene, Myh8, at 7 days post injury, indicating more efficient reassembly of the contractile properties (FIG. 2Ε). PPAR8 activation leads to a temporal shift in the expression patterns of regenerative markers, which together with the histology data, shows a role of PPAR8 in increasing regenerative efficiency. EXAMPLE 4 PPAR5 directs neo-vascularization via regulation of FGF1 This example describes adaptive responses bestowed by PPAR8 activation in the muscle which may contribute to the observed beneficial effects on regeneration. Increased vasculature is one of the hallmarks of oxidative myofibers, which facilitates introduction of immune cells and also supports increased number of satellite cells. TG animals show increased expression of FGF1 in ΤΑ muscle (FIG. 3D). Upon injury, TG animals maintain high expression of FGF1 expression (FIG. 3D). Immunostaining transverse sections of uninjured ΤΑ from WT and TG animals revealed 36% increase in the number of CD31+ capillaries per field by PPAR8 activation (FIGS. 3A-C). Furthermore, after the injury, TG animals show increased expression of CD31, which is indicative of increased vascularity (FIG. 3E-F). The induction of FGFla upon activation of PPAR delta with the GW 1516 ligand was confirmed using a luciferase reporter assay (FIG. 3G). FGF1 has been shown to be expressed in regenerating fibers in chronic disease models and has been implicated in myogenesis and regeneration (Oliver, Growth Factors. 1992;7(2):97-106, 1992; Saito, 2000, Muscle Nerve. 23(4):490-7) and to increase microvasculature in adipocytes and PPAR8 directly regulates expression of FGF1 a iso form (Jonker, et al., Nature. 485(7398):391-4, 2012). Therefore, increased vascularity may contribute to the accelerated regenerative process observed in VP16-PPAR8 animals. EXAMPLE 5 ΡΡΑΚδ activation positively regulates quiescent satellite cell number One of the first events following the injury is the proliferation of muscle resident progenitors, the satellite cells. This example describes results showing that the regenerative advantage observed in TG animals could be due to altered satellite cell homeostasis. Nestin expression was used as a marker of satellite cells, and nestin-GI 'P;VP16-PPAR6 double transgenic animals were used to genetically label quiescent satellite cells(SCs) in vivo (Mignone et αℓ., J Comp Neurol 469(3):311-324 (2004); Day et αℓ., Dev Biol 304(1):246-259 (2007)). Gastrocnemius muscles were enzymatically digested to liberate individual fibers, then mounted for quantification (FIG. 4Α). While double transgenic animals averaged 1.01 SCs per mm of fiber length, GFP+ animals only had 0.15 SCs per mm, a 6.48 fold higher SC content on VP16- PPAR8 muscle fiber (FIG.4B). Satellite cell activity was measured as myoblast proliferation elicited by the freeze bum injury in vivo. After the freeze bum injury, BrdU was intraperitoneally injected at 12 hrs, 24 hrs and 2 days after the injury and the muscles were harvested 7 days after the injury to calculate the ratio of BrdU+ to total nuclei. TG animals showed 40-60% increase in the number of BrdU-r proliferating cells at all three injection times (FIG. 4C). Therefore, PPAR8 induced increase in the number of quiescent satellite cells yields higher number of fusion competent myoblasts, leading to the enhancement of regenerative capacity of the muscle. EXAMPLE 6 Acute pharmacological activation of ΡΡΑΚδ confers regenerative advantage Pharmacological activation of PPAR8 has been shown to induce PPAR8 target genes in fast-twitch hind limb muscles (Narkar et al., Cell 134(3):405-415 (2008)). To demonstrate that an acute pharmacological activation of PPAR8 can modulate regenerative process after injury, C57BL6J mice were treated with GW501516 (Sundai Chemicals, China) orally at 5 mg/kg for 4 days prior to and 5 days after the thermal injury to the ΤΑ. Up-regulation of known PPAR8 target genes (PDK4, CPTlb, and catalase) was confirmed by QPCR, attesting to the successful delivery and activity of the PPAR8 ligand in the muscle (FIG. 5Α). While vehicle treated animals showed dye uptake in 7.6% of the cross sectional area (CSA), merely 4.9% of the muscle CSA was stained in the ligand treated animals (FIGS. 5Β and 5C). Therefore, the drug treated animals showed 34.7% reduction in the proportion of stained area 5 days after the injury, demonstrating that pharmacological activation of PPAR8 enables accelerated restoration of myofiber integrity after the injury. Moreover, BrdU injection at 48 hours after the injury revealed that PPAR8 activation promotes myoblast proliferation after the injury (FIG. 5D). However, an increase in the number of quiescent satellite cells was not observed after 9 days or 4 weeks of ligand treatment. Since satellite cells do not undergo rapid turnover, length of ligand treatment may have been too short. Nonetheless, GW501516 treatment promoted myoblast proliferation in vivo after the injury, which may contribute to the accelerated regeneration after the injury. The expression of inflammatory marker genes at 3 days after the injury was measured by QPCR. While the initial inflammatory responses are similarly generated with or without the PPAR8 ligand treatment at 12 hours after the injury, by 3 days after the injury, the expressions of inflammatory marker genes were significantly reduced by the PPAR8 agonist treatment (FIG. 5Ε). This result is consistent with the known role of PPAR8 as an anti-inflammatory, and also corroborates the data discussed earlier with the genetic over-expression of activated PPAR8 during muscle regeneration. In summary, PPAR8 activation expedites skeletal muscle regeneration following an acute thermal injury. VP16- PPAR8 transgenic animals showed increased satellite cell proliferation at the early phase of the regenerative process, which subsequently translated into increased CSA and the number of nascent regenerating fibers. Most interestingly, muscle specific over expression of PPAR8 seems to increase the resident satellite cell pool. Increased satellite cell population on a muscle fiber seems to contribute to the accelerated resolution of the injury. These findings unveil a novel role for PPAR8 in the maintenance of skeletal muscle; as a potential therapeutic target for accelerated restoration of muscle mass after an acute injury and other atrophic conditions. Notably, PPAR8 activation seems to promote rapid emergence of nascent fibers after the injury. There being no evidence of hyperplasia at 21 days after the injury when the regenerative process is essentially complete, it is concluded that the additional nascent fibers efficiently fuse with each other to restore mature fibers (Karpati G, Molnar MJ in Skeletal muscle repair and regeneration, eds Schiaffino S, Partridge Τ (Springer, Dordrecht), (2008)). While IGF-1 and myostatin seem to rely on fiber hypertrophy to augment regenerative progress, PPAR8 seems to employ a unique way to promote regeneration (Menetrey et αℓ., J Bone Joiny Surg Br 82(1): 131-7 (2000); Wagner etal., Ann Neurol 52(6): 832-6 (2002); Bogdanovich et αℓ., Nature 420(6914):418-21 (2002)). Underlying this difference may be the increased number of quiescent satellite cells. Higher number of progenitor cells leads to the increase in post injury proliferating cells and consequent increase in the number of nascent fibers. While various growth factors and chemokines, including IGF-1 and myostatin, have been shown to enhance proliferation of satellite cells and promote regeneration, it is unclear whether any of them positively regulate the number of quiescent satellite cells (Husmann I etal., Cytokine Growth Factor Rev 7(3):249-258 (1996); McCroskery S etal., J Cell Biol 162(6):1135-1147 (2003); Musaro A et αℓ., Nat Genet 27:195-200 (2001); Amthor Η et αℓ., PNAS 106(18):7479-84 (2009)). The findings shown herein indicate a novel role of PPAR8 as a positive regulator of satellite cell pool. Interestingly, since rapid cell proliferation was not observed under normal conditions, PPAR8 mediated satellite cell expansion is transient and tightly regulated, most likely elicited by external stimuli, such as signals for postnatal growth and injury. In an adult muscle, satellite cell number is finite, diminishing detrimentally in disease state and aging. It is of great therapeutic benefit if PPAR8 activation can bestow infinite abundance of satellite cell population throughout the life of an organism. While enhancement in regenerative capacity was observed in both genetic and pharmacological models, the inherent differences in the experimental parameters is acknowledged. Orally administered GW501516 was delivered systemically, presumably activating PPAR8 in a variety of organs and cell types in the animal. However, in VP16- PPAR8 animals, activation of the PPAR8 receptors is limited to the mature muscle fibers. Additionally, genetic background of the animals may affect the efficiency of regeneration after an injury (Grounds and McGeachie, Cell Tissue Res 255(2):385-391 (1989); Roberts et αℓ., J Anat 191:585-594 (1997)). Extramuscular effects of PPAR8 agonist administration may require further investigation when considering clinical use of GW501516 to augment muscle injury treatment. Recently, pharmacological activation of PPAR8 has been shown to improve sarcolemmal integrity in mdx mice (Miura et αℓ., Hum mol Genet 18(23):4640-4649 (2009)). The results herein expand previous understandings of the role of PPAR8 in muscle physiology. It is shown herein that PPAR8 not only controls running endurance and metabolic parameters in the muscle, but also its regenerative program. PPAR8 activation affects multiple facets of the regenerative program, exerting comprehensive but transient effects to expedite the progress. In view of these findings, PPAR8 may be pharmacologically targeted to enhance the regenerative capacity of the muscle after injury and possibly other degenerative conditions where satellite cell function is compromised. For example, PPAR8 activation can be used to treat other degenerative conditions such as aging induced satellite cell dysfunction and ensuing sarcopenia. EXAMPLE 7 PPAR6 activity screen Cell Culture and Transfection: CV-1 cells were grown in DMEM+10% charcoal stripped FCS. Cells were seeded into 384-well plates the day before transfection to give a confluency of 50-80% at transfection. A total of 0.8 g DNA containing 0.64 micrograms pCMX-PPARDelta LBD, 0.1 micrograms pCMX.beta.Gal, 0.08 micrograms pGLMH2004 reporter and 0.02 micrograms pCMX empty vector was transfected per well using FuGene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche). Cells were allowed to express protein for 48 h followed by addition of compound. Plasmids: Human PPAR8 was used to PCR amplify the PPAR8 LBD. The amplified cDNA ligand binding domain (LBD) of PPAR8 isoform was (PPAR8 amino acid 128 to C-terminus) and fused to the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 by subcloning fragments in frame into the vector pCMX GAL (Sadowski et αℓ. (1992), Gene 118, 137) generating the plasmids pCMX-PPARDelta LBD. Ensuing fusions were verified by sequencing. The pCMXMH2004 luciferase reporter contains multiple copies of the GAL4 DNA response element under a minimal eukaryotic promoter (Hollenberg and Evans, 1988). pCMXpGal was generated. Compounds: All compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted 1:1000 upon addition to the cells. Compounds were tested in quadruple in concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 100 μΜ. Cells were treated with compound for 24 h followed by luciferase assay. Each compound was tested in at least two separate experiments. Luciferase assay: Medium including test compound was aspirated and washed with PBS. 50μ1 PBS including 1 mM Mg++ and Ca++ were then added to each well. The luciferase assay was performed using the LucLite kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Packard Instruments). Light emission was quantified by counting on a Perkin Elmer Envision reader. To measure 3-galactosidase activity 25 μ1 supernatant from each transfection lysate was transferred to a new 384 microplate. Beta-galactosidase assays were performed in the microwell plates using a kit from Promega and read in a Perkin Elmer Envision reader. The beta-galactosidase data were used to normalize (transfection efficiency, cell growth etc.) the luciferase data. Statistical Methods: The activity of a compound is calculated as fold induction compared to an untreated sample. For each compound the efficacy (maximal activity) is given as a relative activity compared to GW501516, a PPAR8 agonist. The ECso is the concentration giving 50% of maximal observed activity. EC50 values were calculated via non-linear regression using GraphPad PRISM (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.).

Eleven (11) identical reactions at the 4.09 mmol scale were setup in parallel and processed in serial, as follows: All four (4) reagents and reaction co-solvents were added to the MW vial in the following sequence; (1) Ethyl 6-(2-((4-bromo-N-cyclopropylbenzamido)methyl)phenoxy) hexanoate (about 2 g), (2) Furan-2-boronic acid (572 mg), (3) Pd(PPh3)4 (141.8 mg), (4) 2.0 Μ sodium carbonate solution (6.135 mL), followed by the co-solvents 95% EtOH and DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane). Care was taken to dispense the DME solvent in such a manner so as to wash down the vial walls of solid catalyst. To each vial was added a magnetic stir bar and fitted with a crimp seal cap and adapter collar. The reactions were than process in the MW Reactor for 10 minutes (at temperature) at 140 °C with mixing. Following standard ramp up, fixed hold time at temperature and cool down, samples were kept sealed at ambient temperature until the entire lot was processed. Note, depending on the age of the tetrakis Pd catalyst (fresh when red, darkens to brown with age) the microwave reaction temperature may need to be increased and the reaction time lengthened. It has been observed that a trace side product increases with reaction temp/time and corresponds to the saponified ester, which is the next and final synthetic step. This ester hydrolysis should be expected given the excess base in the presence of water and ethanol as co-solvents. Therefore the ethyl ester is not isolate. The crude reaction mixtures were individually opens and poured out onto a 800 mL sintered filtration funnel (medium porosity) fitted with a 2L side arm Erlenmeyer flask attached to house vacuum. The funnel was charged with a 2-3” bed of flash grade silica gel (Silicycle, 60A, 40-63 pm, F60 silica gel). A second layer (about 1-2”) of diatomaceous earth filter aid (Celite 545) was packed on top of the silica gel, to produce a binary dry column vacuum chromatography (DCVC) system. A typical CV was about 100 mL, and each reaction mixture was eluted with 1CV of chromatography grade THF. The column was washed with 4CV of THF until no reaction product(s) were visible by TLC. The THF mixture was concentrated to produce about 25 g of viscous oil isolated, that was then taken directly onto the next step. Theoretical yield = 11 χ 1.95 g or 21.45 g (45.0 mmol).

Twenty-two (22) identical reactions at the 2.045 mmol scale were setup in parallel and processed in serial, as follows: All two (2) reagents and reaction co-solvents were added to the MW vial in the following sequence; (1) crude ethyl 6-(2-((N-cyclopropyl-4-(furan-2-yl)benzamido) methyl)phenoxy) hexanoate was dissolved to a volume of 33 mL, 15 mL per reaction vial, and (2) LiOH (hydrate) as a 2 Μ solution in water, 5 mL per reaction vial. To each vial was added a magnetic stir bar and fitted with a crimp seal cap and adapter collar. The reactions were than process in the MW Reactor for 10 minutes (at temperature) at 150 °C with mixing. Following standard ramp up, fixed hold time at temperature and cool down, samples were kept sealed at ambient temperature until the entire lot was processed. The crude reaction mixtures were individually opens and poured out onto a 800 mL sintered filtration funnel (medium porosity) fitted with a 2L side arm Erlenmeyer flask attached to house vacuum. The funnel was charged with a 2-3” bed of flash grade silica gel (Silicycle, 60A, 40-63 pm, F60 silica gel). A second layer (about 1-2”) of diatomaceous earth filter aid (Celite 545) was packed on top of the silica gel, to produce a binary dry column vacuum chromatography system. The dry column was acid washed (acidified with either 1Μ citric acid or IN HC1) with 2 χ 1L of acid solution. A typical CV was about 100 mL, and each reaction mixture was eluted with 1 CV of 1:1 DCM-THF. The column was washed with 4 CV of 1:1 DCM-THF until no reaction product(s) were visible by TLC. The DCM-THF mixture was concentrated to produce about 21 g of viscous oil. This crude product exhibited impurities with Rf values close to that of the desired material. Flash chromatography used four (4) Biotage 65i columns on Biotage SP4, loading about 5 g crude. Theoretical yield = 22 χ 915.2 mg or 20.13 g (45.0 mmol). Isolation and Observed yield = 11.54 g, (11.54 g/20.13 g χ 100) = 57.3%. NMR (¾ 13C, COSY) and LCMS (ESI+/-) conform to structure. Reaction Step 6 - Salt formation Material Source Mol. Wt.

NaOH (1.135 g) was dissolved in 25 mL water, and added dropwise to the stirring THF solution. After the addition was complete the reaction color was very dark (grayish-balck), the ice bath was removed and the reaction as allowed to warm to room temperature and continue to stir an additional 2 hours. The crude reaction mixture was then concentrated and the water was azeotroped away by charging the flask with about 100 mL portions of MeCN (20 times). The solution salt still was not crashing out or precipitating, so the crude salt was places on high vacuum overnight. A white crystalline solid appeared, and was triturated with fresh portions of MeCN, filtered and dried overnight once again to yield a 10.0 g portion (excluding additional material for secondary crystallization from the mother liquor). Theoretical yield = 12.1 g (25.78 mmol). Observed yield = 10.0 g, (10.0 g/12.1 g χ 100) = 82.6%. NMR ('ll, 13C, COSY) and LCMS (ESI+/-) conform to structure. TABLE 1 ID Formula MW Calc. MW Obser.

Nuclear Hormone Receptor (NHR) Assays Cell Handling: PathHunter NHR cell lines were expanded from freezer stocks according to standard procedures. Cells were seeded in a total volume of 20 pL into white walled, 384-well microplates and incubated at 37 °C for the appropriate time prior to testing. Assay media contained charcoal-dextran filtered serum to reduce the level of hormones present. Agonist Format: For agonist determination, cells were incubated with sample to induce response. Intermediate dilution of sample stocks was performed to generate 5Χ sample in assay buffer. 5 pL of 5Χ sample was added to cells and incubated at 37 °C or room temperature for 3-16 hours. Final assay vehicle concentration was 1%. Antagonist Format: For antagonist determination, cells were pre-incubated with antagonist followed by agonist challenge at the ECso concentration. Intermediate dilution of sample stocks was performed to generate 5Χ sample in assay buffer. 5 pL of 5Χ sample was added to cells and incubated at 37 °C or room temperature for 60 minutes. Vehicle concentration was 1%. 5 pL of 6Χ ECso agonist in assay buffer was added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C or room temperature for 3-16 hours. Signal Detection: Assay signal was generated through a single addition of 12.5 or 15 pL (50% ν/ν) of PathHunter Detection reagent cocktail, followed by a one hour incubation at room temperature. Microplates were read following signal generation with a PerkinElmer EnvisionTM instrument for chemiluminescent signal detection. Data Analysis: Compound activity was analyzed using CBIS data analysis suite (Chemlnnovation, CA). For agonist mode assays, percentage activity was calculated using the following formula: % Activity =100% χ (mean RLU of test sample - mean RLU of vehicle control) / (mean MAX control ligand - mean RLU of vehicle control). For antagonist mode assays, percentage inhibition was calculated using the following formula: % Inhibition =100% χ (1 - (mean RLU of test sample - mean RLU of vehicle control) / (mean RLU of ECso control - mean RLU of vehicle control)). Note that for select assays, the ligand response produces a decrease in receptor activity (inverse agonist with a constitutively active target). For those assays inverse agonist activity was calculated using the following formula: % Inverse Agonist Activity =100% χ ((mean RLU of vehicle control - mean RLU of test sample) / (mean RLU of vehicle control - mean RLU of MAX control)).
