,i ,i J ,i :'4 This invention relates to electron sources utilizing the principles of field emission with added features and advantages which result in stabilizing the electrical performance through appropriately controlled heating Of the cathode and to methods of operating. A principal object of the invention is to provide an electron source which offers the unique advantages characteristic of field emission, and at the same time exhibits stability and reproducibility of electrical performance to an extent not realized by previous methods and constructions. Another object of the invention is to provide a field emission cathode of very small size and correspondingly minimized electrical capacity to other electrodes; the electron emission current density of which is both very large and subJect to straightforward and direct electronic control, dependent on and sensitive to the value of the electric field at the cathode surface; the operation of which requires small or negligible energy supply to the cathode from outside sources; and in which emission arises virtually from a point source so that it may be refocussed by electron optical systems into a small spot or beam. A further object is to provide a cathode having a current-voltage relationship which is stable and reproducible during continuous or intermittent operation for useful periods of time, and to maintain such performance in commercially available vacuum conditions, for example, at pressures less than i0-3 mm. of Hg. Other objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following discussion and the accompanying drawings. •i L k There are many references in the literature and in the patent art to attempts to apply a cold cathode field emitter to practical electronic devices. The field emission devices heretofore described have not received widespread use in practice, because their electrical stability and useful operating life have been severely limited. On the other hand, the method and constructions of the present invention have resulted in stable and reproducible performance of field emission cathodes for long periods of operation at useful levels of power and duty cycle. Its application will make possible the development of electronic devices heretofore thought impractical. The objects and advantages outlined above are attained by subjecting a field emission cathode to a pulsed electric field while maintaining the cathode at a temperature high enough to provide differential evaporation of contaminants and smoothing of the cathode surface by surface migration and low enough to avoid undue changes in cathode geometry. Constructions and energizing circuits illustrating the principles of the invention are shown in the accompanying drawings, in which: Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic sectional elevation with portions broken away of a typical electron source construction of the invention with associated energizing circuits, Figs. 2, 3 and 4 are partial diagrammatic views of electron source devices of the invention having various forms of electrodes, and Fig. 5 is a diagrammatic representation of an electron source device embodying a modified form o£ cathode heating circuit. Iv. k : • ii :•¸¸ ¸ ¸- i '¸ • .... .... • 'ï i.-,¸. 'i ü T !iI In all of the figures, the electrode structures are greatly enlarged in relative size for greater clarity of representation. 4 A typical embodiment of the invention is shown in Fig. l. In an evacuated envelope 10, a metallic cathode ll, of smooth surface and small radius of curvature, is mounted on a support filament 12. The filament 12 is raised to an 8 intermediate temperature, for example, about 2000°K by the passage through it of an electric current from external source, for example, transformer 13. A large value of electric field at the cathode surface is established by applying suitable 12 electric potentials to nearby electrodes, which may, for example, have the form of a ring 14 which permits electrons to pass through for further control or utilization in the space beyond. The cathode is maintained by heat conduction from 16 support 12 at a suitable temperature, the range, purposes and sources of which are discussed below. Electrons are emitted under the influence of the large electric field only at the highly curved cathode surface (cathode tip) where the field is high. Electron emission from support structures and filament J is negligible. The potential is applied as a pulse of duration, preferably less than a second at the higher fields used (say 24 7 x107 v/cm) or less than a few minutes at the lower fields (say 3 x107 v/cm); electron currents are drawn from the cathode only during the voltage pulse which is supplied by the pulser circuit 15. The potential is then reduced to a 28 low, or zero, value for an interval, for example, four times as long as the voltage pulse, after which the potential may be applied again and the process repeated. Under such conditions, tungsten cathodes, for example, have been found to have stable and reproducible electrical behavior at useful levels of power and for long operating periods. The heated 4 cathode, however, is not stable under continuous application of high electric field, for the reasons indicated in the following discussion. Field emission current is sensitively dependent on 8 the surface electric field, which varies in part as a function of cathode geometry, and on surface work function. Application of heat maintains constant surface geometry by removing submicroscopic irregularities through surface or volume diffusion 12 which are preferential at surfaces of small radius of curvature. It maintains constant work function by continuously evaporating surface impurities without appreciable evaporation of the base metal, most such impurities being of substantially 16 lower evaporation energy than the usual cathode metals. The range of temperature useful for such purpose varies with the cathode metal, which may be tungsten, tantalum, rhenium, or other material. The temperature must be high enough to evaporate impurities characteristic of the metal used and of the environment, but low enough to avoid substantial thermionic emission and to prevent excessive dulling of the cathode through surface migration. A useful but not re2 strictive temperature range for tungsten has been found to be from 1500°K to 2200°K. While a high cathode temperature usefully maintains a smooth, clean and hence electrical stable cathode surface, during pulsed electrical operation, the 28 accompanying thermal agitation has two undesired effects which must be avoided: first, the sharpened cathode may be gradually dulled by surface migration, and second, impurities may be il 'i 'ii supplied to the emitting surface by volume or surface diffusion, i.e., from sources in the cathode. In particular, impurity centers in the cathode may become exposed, to the cathode surface, during the dulling process. Fortunately, the rate of dulling decreases as the inverse third power of the increasing radius of curvature of a surface, with the practical result that dulling is negligible for radii above a certain size. For tungsten, dulling is negligible for radii greater than r = 6.5 x I0"5 cm, at the preferred temperatures given above. Furthermore, most 'I i!I "i i applications of the invention will involve the use of cathodes 12 having radii larger than that value, and will therefore not suffer from dulling. Cathodes of small radius are useful in some applications and are subject to more rapid dulling; however, a modi16 fixation of the method of the invention will prevent such dulling while conserving the often desirable operating characteristics of small emitters. A continuous electric field of a fraction (say, for example, one-half) the mag itude required for appreciable field emission is maintained at the cathode surface, while a superimposed intermittent pulsed field of higher value permits useful emission to be drawn. The continuous field establishes an equilibrium be24 tween accompanying electrostatic forces and the curvature- .s "ï related forces involved in dulling, effectually preventing the latter. In the form of the invention shown diagrammatically iB Fig. 2 a metallic plate anode 24 intercepts the electrons from cathode ll forming a simple diode structure useful for such purposes as the generation of X-rays. Energization of "i çz i'•i ......................................................... !i ••" • • v ì !i the device and heating of the cathode may be effected by the means described in connection with Fig. 1 or by any of the means hereinafter described. Continuous application of high field to a heated emitter is not practicable, because it results in deformation of the curved surface into a more or less polyhedral shape known in the literature as "build-up", which leads te instability and electrical breakdown. In pulsed operation, however, any tendency to such distortion during the fleld-on period is counteracted and the smooth, curved surface restored during the period between pulses. The total current expected from field cathodes is the product of emitting area and current density. For example, if the latter is 107 amps/cm2, a level expected to be useful in practice, then the total current I yielded by a needleshaped cathode with tip radius r at applied voltage V is approximately as follows: r (cm) V (kv) I (amps) 2 x10-5 5 .05 x1O-5 15 .2° 3 x 10-4 i00 6.5 Here a needle of 15° cone angle and an anode-cathode spacing of 1 cm are assumed. Gloser spacing will increase the field 24 and hence the current at a given voltage. Simultaneously operated parallel emitters as shown at 41 in Fig. 4 have been successfully used for the purpose of increasing the total outrent to levels considerably greater than those tabulated 28 above. Higher potentials permit the use of other cathode geometries, such as the "razor edge" emitter shown at 31 in Fig. 3, with larger area and hence larger ,total current. ï il ..... i ï ï .... : ï:il ...... .... i: ¸ I The source of the heat used for stabilization may be the supporting filament heated by an electric current from external source as shown in Fig. l. Alternate heating methods include bombardment by particles from other sources, radiation from nearby auxiliary surfaces, induction heating, and resistive heating generated in the cathode itself by the passage of the emission current. The principles of the invert8 tion, however, are not dependent on any particular source of heat. A suitable arrangement for use with bombardment or radiation heating is illustrated in Fig. In the device of Fig. 5, the cathode ll is heated I by electron bombardment from filament coil 56 which is heated by current from transformer 53. A suitable potential is maintained between coil 56 and cathode support 12 by a voltage from voltage source 57. 16 Advantage has been taken of the principles of operation of the present invention to miniaturize the structure to such an extent that the overall dimension of the cathodesupport assembly II, 12 as shown, for example, in Figs. I and 2 is of the order of 10-2 cm. Advantages of such a structure include its low power requirement, negligible thermal expansion, and the short time required for heating and cooling (10-3 sec.), as well as mechanical strength due to very small inertia. 2 The combination of high cathode field, intermediate temperature, and intermittent pulsed application of the electric field are characteristic and novel features of this invention. Under such conditions, the cathode is electrically 28 stable in spite of bombardment of the cathode by positive ions, and in spite of contamination by incident foreign material.
