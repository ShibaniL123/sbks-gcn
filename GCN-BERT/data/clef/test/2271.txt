[Step 3] Synthesis of methyl 3-fluoro-4-((N-(3-fluorophenyl)acetamido)methyl)benzoate
Methyl 3-fluoro-4-(((3-fluorophenyl)amino)methyl)benzoate (0.200 g, 0.721 mmol), synthesized in step 2, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.251 mL, 1.443 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) at room temperature, and acetyl chloride (0.061 mL, 0.866 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 12 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 80%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.210 g, 91.2%) as yellow oil.
