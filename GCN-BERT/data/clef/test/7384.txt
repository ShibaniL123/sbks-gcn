Example 5: Synthesis of 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4H-thiochromen-4-one, 1-S-PQS (Compound 5)
Synthesis of 2-heptylthiochroman-4-one (5a)
Under nitrogen atmosphere octanal (0.842 g, 6.57 mmol) was dissolved in 33.33 mL dry toluene and pyrrolidine (0.234 g, 3.285 mmol) was added. The solution becomes murky and after 10 minutes 1.00 g (6.57 mmol) of 2-thioacetophenone were added carefully. After it was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature the solution became clear and yellow and the temperature was raised to 110Â°C. The reaction was refluxed for 3 h and when it was cooled to room temperature the mixture was diluted with diethyl ether, washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution, water and brine. The organic solution was dried over MgSO4, evaporated and the pure product was obtained over silica gel chromatography in n-hexane/ethyl acetate 9:1 as a yellow oil (0.702 g, 41 %). Rf = 0.51 (n-hexane/ethyl acetate 12:1).
