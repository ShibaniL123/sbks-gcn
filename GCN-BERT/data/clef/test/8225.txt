4-[(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)amino]-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylic acid
At RT, 5.9 ml (11.75 mmol) of 2-methyl-2-butene and a solution of 1.06 g (11.75 mmol) of sodium chlorite and 1.83 g (11.75 mmol) of sodium dihydrogen phosphate in 15 ml of water were added to a solution of 1.0 g (3.92 mmol) of tert-butyl (1-formyl-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-4-yl)carbamate (preparation described in ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters 2014, 5, 609-614 and WO2013/3383 A1, p. 76) in 30 ml of THF, and the mixture was stirred at RT. The course of the reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography. After 4 h of stirring at RT, the mixture was diluted with water and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. This gave 1.06 g (99% of theory, purity not determined) of the title compound
