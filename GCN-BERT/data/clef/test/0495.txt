Step 4
30 g (0.11 mol) of (1-c) is added to a 500 ml three-necked flask, 200 ml of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is added under the protection of nitrogen and stirred uniformly, and 8.8 g (0.22 mol) of 60% sodium hydride mineral oil is added, heated to 120° C. and stirred for 4 hours; and the reaction is stopped, the reaction liquid is cooled to room temperature, poured to 300 g of ice water and stirred, a large amount of solid is precipitated, the solid is subjected to suction filtration with a filter cloth and aired to obtain a solid, 200 ml of petroleum ether is added and heated to complete dissolution, followed by passing through a 30 g hot silica gel column, the column is rinsed with 200 ml of hot petroleum ether, and after the rotary drying of the solution, 1 fold of toluene and 2 folds of petroleum ether are added and heated to complete dissolution, followed by recrystallization at 0° C. twice, to obtain 12 g of a white solid (I1-1) with a GC of 99.90% and a yield of 42%.
