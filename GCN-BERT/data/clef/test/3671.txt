Step 2: Synthesis of 7-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)hepta-4,6-diyn-1-ol hydrochloride
To a solution of tert-butyl 4-(7-hydroxyhepta-1,3-diyn-1-yl)-3,6-dihydropyridine-1(2H)-carboxylate (1.8 g, 1 eq) in MeOH (30 ml) was added with acetyl chloride (4.42 ml, 10 eq). The mixture was stirred for 4 hr at 60Â° C., cooled down to room temperature and diluted in diethyl ether. The precipitated solid was filtered off to prepare the title compound (1 g, 71%).
