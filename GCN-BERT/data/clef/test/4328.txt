Example 4
Preparation of 4-(3-(3-fluoro-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)-4-nitro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)cyclohexan-1-one 108
3-fluoro-2-(4-nitro-1-(1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]decan-8-yl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine 106 (18.0 g, 43.2 mM) was dissolved in acetone (400 ml), then water (100 ml) and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (20.6 g, 108 mM) were added. The mixture was heated at 80° C. for 6 hours. The acetone was removed under reduced pressure and a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3 (200 ml) was added. The aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc (2×300 ml) and the combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4. The crude product was further purified by flash chromatography eluting with Hexane/EtOAc (gradient 0 to 50%). The title compound 108 was obtained as an off-white solid (12.5 g, 78% yield).
