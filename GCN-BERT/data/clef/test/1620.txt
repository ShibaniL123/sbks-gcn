TECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to compositions and methods for the manipulation of cellular lipid production and/or cellular lipid profile. BACKGROUND Plant oil is an economically important product not only due to its broad utilization in the food industry and as a component of feed ingredients but it also has a wide range of applications as biofuels or in the manufacture of various nutraceutical and industrial products. Within the plant itself, oil is essential to carry out a number of metabolic processes which are vital to growth and development particularly during seed germination and early plant growth stages. Considering its value, there is a growing research interest within the biotechnology field to improve plant oil production and make the supply more sustainable. The major component of plant oil is triacylglyceride (TAG). It is the main form of storage lipid in oil seeds and the primary source of energy for seed germination and seedling development. TAG biosynthesis via the Kennedy pathway involves sequential acylation steps starting from the precursor sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P). Firstly, G3P is esterified by an acyl-CoA to form lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in a reaction catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT, EC 2.3.1.15). This is followed by a second acylation step catalyzed by lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (LPAT; EC 2.3.1.51) forming phosphatidic acid (PA), a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of glycerolipids. The PA is then dephosphorylated by the enzyme phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP; EC3.1.3.4) to release the immediate precursor for TAG, the sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG). Finally, DAG is acylated in the sn-3 position by the enzyme diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT; EC 2.3.1.20) to form TAG. Since this last catalytic action is the only unique step in TAG biosynthesis, DGAT is termed as the committed triacylglycerol-forming enzyme. As DAG is located at the branch point between TAG and membrane phospholipid biosyntheses, DGAT potentially plays a decisive role in regulating the formation of TAG in the glycerolipid synthesis pathway (Lung and Weselake, 2006, Lipids. December 2006; 41(12):1073-88). There are two different families of DGAT proteins. The first family of DGAT proteins (“DGAT1”) is related to the acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (“ACAT”) and has been described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,100,077 and 6,344,548. A second family of DGAT proteins (“DGAT2”) is unrelated to the DGAT1 family and is described in PCT Patention Publication WO 2004/011671 published Feb. 5, 2004. Other references to DGAT genes and their use in plants include PCT Publication Nos. WO2004/011,671, WO1998/055,631, and WO2000/001,713, and US Patent Publication No. 20030115632. DGAT1 is typically the major TAG synthesising enzyme in both the seed and senescing leaf (Kaup et al., 2002, Plant Physiol. 129(4):1616-26; for reviews see Lung and Weselake 2006, Lipids. 41(12):1073-88; Cahoon et al., 2007, Current Opinion in Plant Biology. 10:236-244; and Li et al., 2010, Lipids. 45:145-157). Raising the yield of oilseed crops (canola, sunflower, safflower, soybean, corn, cotton, linseed, flax etc) has been a major target for the agricultural industry for decades. Many approaches (including traditional and mutational breeding as well as genetic engineering) have been tried, typically with modest success (Xu et al., 2008, Plant Biotechnol J., 6:799-818 and references therein). Although liquid biofuels offer considerable promise the reality of utilising biological material is tempered by competing uses and the quantities available. Consequently, engineering plants and microorganisms to address this is the focus of multiple research groups; in particular the accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) in vegetative tissues and oleaginous yeasts and bacteria (Fortman et al., 2008, Trends Biotechnol 26, 375-381; Ohlrogge et al., 2009, Science 324, 1019-1020). TAG is a neutral lipid with twice the energy density of cellulose and can be used to generate biodiesel a high energy density desirable biofuel with one of the simplest and most efficient manufacturing processes. Engineering TAG accumulation in leaves has so far resulted in a 5-20 fold increase over WT utilising a variety of strategies which includes: the over-expression of seed development transcription factors (LEC1, LEC2 and WRI1); silencing of APS (a key gene involved in starch biosynthesis); mutation of CGI-58 (a regulator of neutral lipid accumulation); and upregulation of the TAG synthesising enzyme DGAT (diacylglycerol O acyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.20) in plants and also in yeast (Andrianov et al., 2009, Plant Biotech J 8, 1-11; Mu et al., 2008, Plant Physiol 148, 1042-1054; Sanjaya et al., 2011, Plant Biotech J 9, 874-883; Santos-Mendoza, et al., 2008, Plant J 54, 608-620; James et al., 2010, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 107, 17833-17838; Beopoulos et al., 2011, Appl Microbiol Biotechnol 90, 1193-1206; Bouvier-Nave et al., 2000, Eur J Biochem 267, 85-96; Durrett et al., 2008, Plant J 54, 593-607). However, it has been acknowledged that to achieve further increases in TAG, preventing its catabolism may be crucial within non oleaginous tissues and over a range of developmental stages (Yang and Ohlrogge, 2009, Plant Physiol 150, 1981-1989). Positively manipulating the yield and quality of triacylglycerides (TAG) in eukaryotes is difficult to achieve. The enzyme diacylglycerol-O-acyltransferase (DGAT) has the lowest specific activity of the Kennedy pathway enzymes and is regarded as a ‘bottleneck’ in TAG synthesis. Attempts have been made previously to improve DGAT1 by biotechnological methods, with limited success. For example Nykiforuk et al., (2002, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1580:95-109) reported N-terminal truncation of the Brassica napus DGAT1 but reported approximately 50% lower activity. McFie et al., (2010, JBC., 285:37377-37387) reported that N-terminal truncation of the mouse DGAT1 resulted in increased specific activity of the enzyme, but also reported a large decline in the level of protein that accumulated. Xu et al., (2008, Plant Biotechnology Journal, 6:799-818) recently identified a consensus sequence (X-Leu-X-Lys-X-X-Ser-X-X-X-Val) within Tropaeolum majus (garden nasturtium) DGAT1 (TmDGAT1) sequences as a targeting motif typical of members of the SNF1-related protein kinase-1 (SnRK1) with Ser being the residue for phosphorylation. The SnRK1 proteins are a class of Ser/Thr protein kinases that have been increasingly implicated in the global regulation of carbon metabolism in plants, e.g. the inactivation of sucrose phosphate synthase by phosphorylation (Halford & Hardie 1998, Plant Mol Biol. 37:735-48. Review). Xu et al., (2008, Plant Biotechnology Journal, 6:799-818) performed site-directed mutagenesis on six putative functional regions/motifs of the TmDGAT1 enzyme. Mutagenesis of a serine residue (S197) in a putative SnRK1 target site resulted in a 38%-80% increase in DGAT1 activity, and over-expression of the mutated TmDGAT1 in Arabidopsis resulted in a 20%-50% increase in oil content on a per seed basis. It would be beneficial to provide improved forms of DGAT1, which overcome one or more of the deficiencies in the prior art, and which can be used to increase cellular oil production. It is an object of the invention to provide enhanced DGAT1 proteins and methods for their use to alter at least one of cellular lipid production and cellular lipid profile, and/or at least to provide the public with a useful choice.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In this specification where reference has been made to patent specifications, other external documents, or other sources of information, this is generally for the purpose of providing a context for discussing the features of the invention. Unless specifically stated otherwise, reference to such external documents is not to be construed as an admission that such documents, or such sources of information, in any jurisdiction, are prior art, or form part of the common general knowledge in the art. The term “comprising” as used in this specification means “consisting at least in part of”. When interpreting each statement in this specification that includes the term “comprising”, features other than that or those prefaced by the term may also be present. Related terms such as “comprise” and “comprises” are to be interpreted in the same manner. In some embodiments, the term “comprising” (and related terms such as “comprise and “comprises”) can be replaced by “consisting of” (and related terms “consist” and “consists”). DEFINITIONS The term “DGAT1” as used herein means acyl CoA: diacylglycerol acyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.20) DGAT1 is typically the major TAG synthesising enzyme in both the seed and senescing leaf (Kaup et al., 2002, Plant Physiol. 129(4):1616-26; for reviews see Lung and Weselake 2006, Lipids. 41(12):1073-88; Cahoon et al., 2007, Current Opinion in Plant Biology. 10:236-244; and Li et al., 2010, Lipids. 45:145-157). DGAT1 contains approximately 500 amino acids and has 10 predicted transmembrane domains whereas DGAT2 has only 320 amino acids and is predicted to contain only two transmembrane domains; both proteins were also predicted to have their N- and C-termini located in the cytoplasm (Shockey et al., 2006, Plant Cell 18:2294-2313). Both DGAT1 and DGAT2 have orthologues in animals and fungi and are transmembrane proteins located in the ER. In most dicotyledonous plants DGAT1 & DGAT2 appear to be single copy genes whereas there are typically two versions of each in the grasses which presumably arose during the duplication of the grass genome (Salse et al., 2008, Plant Cell, 20:11-24). The term “first DGAT1 protein” or “second DGAT1 protein” as used herein typically means a naturally occurring or native DGAT1. In some cases the DGAT1 sequence may have been assembled from sequences in the genome, but may not be expressed in plants. In one embodiment the first or second DGAT1 protein may therefore not be a DGAT1 that is isolated from nature. In one embodiment the “first DGAT1 protein” or “second DGAT1 protein” has the sequence of any one of SEQ ID NO: 1 to 29 or a variant thereof. Preferably the variant has at least 70% identity to any one of SEQ ID NO: 1 to 29. In a further embodiment the “first DGAT1 protein” or “second DGAT1 protein” has the sequence of any one of SEQ ID NO: 1 to 29. In one embodiment “first DGAT1 protein” or “second DGAT1 protein” is encoded by a polynucleotide comprising the sequence of any one of SEQ ID NO: 30 to 58 or a variant thereof. Preferably the variant has at least 70% identity to any one of SEQ ID NO: 30 to 58. In a further embodiment the “first DGAT1 protein” or “second DGAT1 protein” is encoded by a polynucleotide comprising the sequence of any one of SEQ ID NO: 30 to 58. In one embodiment the chimeric DGAT1 sequences comprises the sequence of any SEQ ID NO: 59 to 94 or a variant thereof. Preferably the variant has at least 70% identity to any one of SEQ ID NO: 59 to 94. In a further embodiment the chimeric DGAT1 sequences the sequence of any one of SEQ ID NO: 59 to 94. In a further embodiment the chimeric DGAT1 polypeptide sequences have the sequence of any SEQ ID NO: 59, 61, 66, 68, 70-72, 74-76, 78, 79, 82, 84-86, 88-90, 92 and 93 or a variant thereof. Preferably the variant has at least 70% identity to any one of SEQ ID NO: 59, 61, 66, 68, 70-72, 74-76, 78, 79, 82, 84-86, 88-90, 92 and 93. In a further embodiment the chimeric DGAT1 sequences have the sequence of any one of SEQ ID NO: 59, 61, 66, 68, 70-72, 74-76, 78, 79, 82, 84-86, 88-90, 92 and 93. Although not preferred, the chimeric DGAT1 of the invention may include further modifications in at least one of: a) the N-terminal portion of a first DGAT1 protein, andb) the C-terminal portion of a second DGAT1 protein. Preferably the chimeric DGAT1 of the invention includes a functional acyl-CoA binding site. The terms upstream and downstream are according to normal convention to mean towards the N-terminus of a polypeptide, and towards the C-terminus of a polypeptide, respectively. Acyl-CoA Binding Site The position of the acyl-CoA binding site in a number of DGAT1 sequences is shown if FIG. 3. Conserved Motif ESPLSS In a preferred embodiment the acyl-CoA binding site comprises the conserved motif ESPLSS Acyl-CoA Binding Site General Formulae In a preferred embodiment the acyl-CoA binding site in the chimeric DGAT1 has the formula: [in-line-formulae]XXXESPLSSXXIFXXXHA,[/in-line-formulae] where X is any amino acid. In a preferred embodiment the acyl-CoA binding site in the chimeric DGAT1 has the formula: [in-line-formulae]XXXESPLSSXXIFXXSHA,[/in-line-formulae] where X is any amino acid. In a preferred embodiment the acyl-CoA binding site in the chimeric DGAT1 has the formula: [in-line-formulae]X1X2X3ESPLSSX4X5IFX6X7X8HA,[/in-line-formulae] where X1=R, K, V, T, A, S or G; X2=A, T, V, I, N, R, S or L; X3=R or K; X4=D or G; X5=A, T, N, or L; X6=K or R; X7=Q or H; and X8=S or is absent. In a preferred embodiment the acyl-CoA binding site in the chimeric DGAT1 has the formula: [in-line-formulae]X1X2X3ESPLSSX4X5IFX6X7SHA,[/in-line-formulae] where X1=R, K, V, T, A, S or G; X2=A, T, V, I, N, R, S or L; X3=R or K; X4=D or G; X5=A, T, N, or L; X6=K or R; and X7=Q or H. Methods for Producing Chimeric DGAT1 Proteins Methods for producing chimeric proteins, or the polynucleotide sequences encoding them, are well known to those skilled in the art. A chimeric DGAT1 protein may be conveniently be produced by combining, using standard molecular biological techniques such as restriction digestion and ligation, sequences encoding DGAT1 proteins, and then expressing the chimeric DGAT1 protein. Alternatively polynucleotide sequences encoding the chimeric DGAT1 proteins may be conveniently synthesised, and the chimeric proteins expressed from the synthesised sequences. For making multiple chimeric DGAT1 proteins the encoding sequences can be synthesised to include restriction sites that do not alter the amino acid sequence of the expressed proteins. These restrictions sites can be utilised to combine sequences for production and expression of the chimeric proteins. These and similar methods for producing chimeric proteins are known to those skilled in the art. The first and second DGAT1 protein sequences, and encoding polynucleotides, used to produce the chimeric DGAT1 proteins of the invention, may be selected from those disclosed herein. Alternatively further DGAT1 sequences can be identified by methods well known to those skilled in the art, including bioinformatic database searching, as well as physical cloning methods. The first and second DGAT1 protein sequences may be from any species, including plants, animals and microorganisms. The phrase “increased DGAT1 activity” means increased specific activity relative to that of the first and/or DGAT1 protein. An art skilled worker would know how to test the “specific activity” of the chimeric DGAT1. This may typically be done by isolating, enriching and quantifying the recombinant DGAT1 then using this material to determine either the rate of triacylglyceride formation and/or the disappearance of precursor substrates (including various forms of acyl-CoA and DAG) as per Xu et al., (2008), Plant Biotechnology Journal. 6:799-818. The phrase “increased stability” means that the chimeric DGAT1 protein is more stable, when expressed in a cell, than the first and/or second DGAT1. This may lead to increased accumulation of active chimeric DGAT1 when it is expressed in cells, relative to when the first and/or second DGAT1 is expressed in cells. Those skilled in the art know how to test the “stability” of the chimeric DGAT1. This would typically involve expressing the chimeric DGAT1 in a cell, or cells, and expressing the first or second DGAT1 in a separate cell, or cells of the same type. Accumulation of chimeric and the first or second DGAT1 protein in the respective cells can then be measured, for example by immunoblot and/or ELISA. A higher level of accumulation of the chimeric DGAT1 relative to the first or second DGAT1, at the same time point, indicates that the chimeric DGAT1 has increased stability. Alternatively, stability may also be determined by the formation of quaternary structure which can also be determined by immunoblot analysis. The phrase “altered oligomerisation properties” means that the way in which, or the extent to which chimeric DGAT1 forms oligomers is altered relative to the first and/or second DGAT1. Those skilled in the art know how to test the “oligomerisation properties” of the chimeric DGAT1. This may typically be done by immunoblot analysis or size exclusion chromatography. The phrase “substantially normal cellular protein accumulation properties” means that the chimeric DGAT1 of the invention retains substantially the same protein accumulation when expressed in a cell, as does the first and/or second DGAT1. That is there is no less accumulation of chimeric DGAT1 than there is accumulation of first and/or second DGAT1, when either are separately expressed in the same cell type. An art skilled worker would know how to test the “cellular protein accumulation properties” of the chimeric DGAT1. This would typically involve expressing the chimeric DGAT1 in a cell, or cells, and expressing the first or second DGAT1 in a separate cell, or cells of the same type. Accumulation of chimeric and the first or second DGAT1 protein in the respective cells can then be measured, for example by ELISA or immunoblot. A substantially similar level of accumulation of the chimeric DGAT1 relative to the first or second DGAT1, at the same time point, indicates that the chimeric DGAT1 has increased “substantially normal cellular protein accumulation properties”. The phrase “substantially normal subcellular targetting properties” means that the chimeric DGAT1 of the invention retains substantially the same subcellular targetting when expressed in a cell, as does the first and/or second DGAT1. That is the chimeric DGAT1 is targeted to the same subcellular compartment/s as the first and/or second DGAT1, when either are separately expressed in the same cell type. An art skilled worker would know how to test the “subcellular targetting properties” of the chimeric DGAT1. This would typically involve expressing the chimeric DGAT1 in a cell, or cells, and expressing the first or second DGAT1 in a separate cell, or cells of the same type. Subcellular targetting of chimeric and the first or second DGAT1 protein in the respective cells can then be assessed, for example by using ultracentrifugation to separate and isolating individual subcellular fractions then determining the level of DGAT1 in each fraction. Substantially similar “subcellular targeting” of the chimeric DGAT1 relative to the first or second DGAT1, at the same time point, indicates that the chimeric DGAT1 has increased “substantially normal cellular protein has “substantially normal subcellular targetting properties”. Lipid In one embodiment the lipid is an oil. In a further embodiment the oil is triacylglycerol (TAG) Lipid Production In certain embodiments the cell, cells, tissues, plants and plant parts of the invention produces more lipid than control cells, tissues, plants and plant parts. Those skilled in the art are well aware of methods for measuring lipid production. This may typically be done by quantitative fatty acid methyl ester gas chromatography mass spectral analysis (FAMES GC-MS). Suitable methods are also described in the examples section of this specification. Substrate Specificity In certain embodiments, the polypeptides of the invention have altered substrate specificity relative to parent DGAT1 proteins. Plant DGAT1 proteins are relatively promiscuous in terms of the fatty acid substrates and DAG species they are capable of utilisting to generate TAG. As such they can be considered to have relatively low substrate specificity. However, this can be modified such that certain fatty acids become a preferred substrate over others. This leads to an increase in the proportions of the preferred fatty acids in the TAG and decreases in the proportions of the non preferred fatty acid species. Substrate specificity can be determined by in vitro quantitative analysis of TAG production following the addition of specific and known quantities of purified substrates to known quantities of recombinant DGAT, as per Xu et al., (2008), Plant Biotechnology Journal. 6:799-818. Lipid Profile In a further embodiment the cell, cells, tissues, plants and plant parts of the invention have an altered lipid profile relative to the control cells, tissues, plants and plant parts. Those skilled in the art are well aware of methods for assessing lipid profile. This may involve assessing the proportion or percentage of at least one of the 16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 18:1c9 fatty acid species present in the lipid. This may typically be done by fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis (Browse et al., 1986, Anal. Biochem. 152, 141-145). Suitable methods are also described in the examples section of this specification.

Plant Parts, Propagues and Progeny The term “plant” is intended to include a whole plant, any part of a plant, a seed, a fruit, propagules and progeny of a plant. The term ‘propagule’ means any part of a plant that may be used in reproduction or propagation, either sexual or asexual, including seeds and cuttings. The plants of the invention may be grown and either self-ed or crossed with a different plant strain and the resulting progeny, comprising the polynucleotides or constructs of the invention, and/or expressing the chimeric DGAT1 sequences of the invention, also form an part of the present invention. Preferably the plants, plant parts, propagules and progeny comprise a polynucleotide or construct of the invention, and/or express a chimeric DGAT1 sequence of the invention. Polynucleotides and Fragments The term “polynucleotide(s),” as used herein, means a single or double-stranded deoxyribonucleotide or ribonucleotide polymer of any length but preferably at least 15 nucleotides, and include as non-limiting examples, coding and non-coding sequences of a gene, sense and antisense sequences complements, exons, introns, genomic DNA, cDNA, pre-mRNA, mRNA, rRNA, siRNA, miRNA, tRNA, ribozymes, recombinant polypeptides, isolated and purified naturally occurring DNA or RNA sequences, synthetic RNA and DNA sequences, nucleic acid probes, primers and fragments. A “fragment” of a polynucleotide sequence provided herein is a subsequence of contiguous nucleotides. The term “primer” refers to a short polynucleotide, usually having a free 3′OH group, that is hybridized to a template and used for priming polymerization of a polynucleotide complementary to the target. The term “probe” refers to a short polynucleotide that is used to detect a polynucleotide sequence that is complementary to the probe, in a hybridization-based assay. The probe may consist of a “fragment” of a polynucleotide as defined herein. Polypeptides and Fragments The term “polypeptide”, as used herein, encompasses amino acid chains of any length but preferably at least 5 amino acids, including full-length proteins, in which amino acid residues are linked by covalent peptide bonds. Polypeptides of the present invention, or used in the methods of the invention, may be purified natural products, or may be produced partially or wholly using recombinant or synthetic techniques. A “fragment” of a polypeptide is a subsequence of the polypeptide that preferably performs a function of and/or provides three dimensional structure of the polypeptide. The term may refer to a polypeptide, an aggregate of a polypeptide such as a dimer or other multimer, a fusion polypeptide, a polypeptide fragment, a polypeptide variant, or derivative thereof capable of performing the above enzymatic activity. The term “isolated” as applied to the polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences disclosed herein is used to refer to sequences that are removed from their natural cellular environment. An isolated molecule may be obtained by any method or combination of methods including biochemical, recombinant, and synthetic techniques. The term “recombinant” refers to a polynucleotide sequence that is removed from sequences that surround it in its natural context and/or is recombined with sequences that are not present in its natural context. A “recombinant” polypeptide sequence is produced by translation from a “recombinant” polynucleotide sequence. The term “derived from” with respect to polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention being derived from a particular genera or species, means that the polynucleotide or polypeptide has the same sequence as a polynucleotide or polypeptide found naturally in that genera or species. The polynucleotide or polypeptide, derived from a particular genera or species, may therefore be produced synthetically or recombinantly. Variants As used herein, the term “variant” refers to polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences different from the specifically identified sequences, wherein one or more nucleotides or amino acid residues is deleted, substituted, or added. Variants may be naturally occurring allelic variants, or non-naturally occurring variants. Variants may be from the same or from other species and may encompass homologues, paralogues and orthologues. In certain embodiments, variants of the inventive polypeptides and polypeptides possess biological activities that are the same or similar to those of the inventive polypeptides or polypeptides. The term “variant” with reference to polypeptides and polypeptides encompasses all forms of polypeptides and polypeptides as defined herein. Polynucleotide Variants Variant polynucleotide sequences preferably exhibit at least 50%, more preferably at least 51%, more preferably at least 52%, more preferably at least 53%, more preferably at least 54%, more preferably at least 55%, more preferably at least 56%, more preferably at least 57%, more preferably at least 58%, more preferably at least 59%, more preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 61%, more preferably at least 62%, more preferably at least 63%, more preferably at least 64%, more preferably at least 65%, more preferably at least 66%, more preferably at least 67%, more preferably at least 68%, more preferably at least 69%, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 71%, more preferably at least 72%, more preferably at least 73%, more preferably at least 74%, more preferably at least 75%, more preferably at least 76%, more preferably at least 77%, more preferably at least 78%, more preferably at least 79%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 81%, more preferably at least 82%, more preferably at least 83%, more preferably at least 84%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 86%, more preferably at least 87%, more preferably at least 88%, more preferably at least 89%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 91%, more preferably at least 92%, more preferably at least 93%, more preferably at least 94%, more preferably at least 95%, more preferably at least 96%, more preferably at least 97%, more preferably at least 98%, and most preferably at least 99% identity to a sequence of the present invention. Identity is found over a comparison window of at least 20 nucleotide positions, preferably at least 50 nucleotide positions, more preferably at least 100 nucleotide positions, and most preferably over the entire length of a polynucleotide of the invention. Polynucleotide sequence identity can be determined in the following manner. The subject polynucleotide sequence is compared to a candidate polynucleotide sequence using BLASTN (from the BLAST suite of programs, version 2.2.5 [November 2002]) in bl2seq (Tatiana A. Tatusova, Thomas L. Madden (1999), “Blast 2 sequences—a new tool for comparing protein and nucleotide sequences”, FEMS Microbiol Lett. 174:247-250), which is publicly available from the NCBI website on the World Wide Web at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/. The default parameters of bl2seq are utilized except that filtering of low complexity parts should be turned off. The identity of polynucleotide sequences may be examined using the following unix command line parameters: bl2seq -i nucleotideseq1 -j nucleotideseq2 -F F -p blastn The parameter -F F turns off filtering of low complexity sections. The parameter -p selects the appropriate algorithm for the pair of sequences. The bl2seq program reports sequence identity as both the number and percentage of identical nucleotides in a line “Identities=”. Polynucleotide sequence identity may also be calculated over the entire length of the overlap between a candidate and subject polynucleotide sequences using global sequence alignment programs (e.g. Needleman, S. B. and Wunsch, C. D. (1970) J. Mol. Biol. 48, 443-453). A full implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm is found in the needle program in the EMBOSS package (Rice, P. Longden, I. and Bleasby, A. EMBOSS: The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite, Trends in Genetics June 2000, vol 16, No 6. pp. 276-277) which can be obtained from the World Wide Web at http://www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/. The European Bioinformatics Institute server also provides the facility to perform EMBOSS-needle global alignments between two sequences on line at http:/www.ebi.ac.uk/emboss/align/. Alternatively the GAP program may be used which computes an optimal global alignment of two sequences without penalizing terminal gaps. GAP is described in the following paper: Huang, X. (1994) On Global Sequence Alignment. Computer Applications in the Biosciences 10, 227-235. A preferred method for calculating polynucleotide % sequence identity is based on aligning sequences to be compared using Clustal X (Jeanmougin et al., 1998, Trends Biochem. Sci. 23, 403-5.) Polynucleotide variants of the present invention also encompass those which exhibit a similarity to one or more of the specifically identified sequences that is likely to preserve the functional equivalence of those sequences and which could not reasonably be expected to have occurred by random chance. Such sequence similarity with respect to polypeptides may be determined using the publicly available bl2seq program from the BLAST suite of programs (version 2.2.5 [November 2002]) from the NCBI website on the World Wide Web at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/. The similarity of polynucleotide sequences may be examined using the following unix command line parameters: [in-line-formulae]bl2seq nucleotideseq1 -j nucleotideseq2 -F F -p tblastx[/in-line-formulae] The parameter -F F turns off filtering of low complexity sections. The parameter -p selects the appropriate algorithm for the pair of sequences. This program finds regions of similarity between the sequences and for each such region reports an “E value” which is the expected number of times one could expect to see such a match by chance in a database of a fixed reference size containing random sequences. The size of this database is set by default in the bl2seq program. For small E values, much less than one, the E value is approximately the probability of such a random match. Variant polynucleotide sequences preferably exhibit an E value of less than 1×10-6 more preferably less than 1×10-9, more preferably less than 1×10-12, more preferably less than 1×10-15, more preferably less than 1×10-18, more preferably less than 1×10-21, more preferably less than 1×10-30, more preferably less than 1×10-40, more preferably less than 1×10-50, more preferably less than 1×10-60, more preferably less than 1×10-70, more preferably less than 1×10-80, more preferably less than 1×10-90 and most preferably less than 1×10-100 when compared with any one of the specifically identified sequences. Alternatively, variant polynucleotides of the present invention, or used in the methods of the invention, hybridize to the specified polynucleotide sequences, or complements thereof under stringent conditions. The term “hybridize under stringent conditions”, and grammatical equivalents thereof, refers to the ability of a polynucleotide molecule to hybridize to a target polynucleotide molecule (such as a target polynucleotide molecule immobilized on a DNA or RNA blot, such as a Southern blot or Northern blot) under defined conditions of temperature and salt concentration. The ability to hybridize under stringent hybridization conditions can be determined by initially hybridizing under less stringent conditions then increasing the stringency to the desired stringency. With respect to polynucleotide molecules greater than about 100 bases in length, typical stringent hybridization conditions are no more than 25 to 30° C. (for example, 10° C.) below the melting temperature (Tm) of the native duplex (see generally, Sambrook et al., Eds, 1987, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press; Ausubel et al., 1987, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing,). Tm for polynucleotide molecules greater than about 100 bases can be calculated by the formula Tm=81.5+0.41% (G+C-log (Na+). (Sambrook et al., Eds, 1987, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press; Bolton and McCarthy, 1962, PNAS 84:1390). Typical stringent conditions for polynucleotide of greater than 100 bases in length would be hybridization conditions such as prewashing in a solution of 6×SSC, 0.2% SDS; hybridizing at 65° C., 6×SSC, 0.2% SDS overnight; followed by two washes of 30 minutes each in 1×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65° C. and two washes of 30 minutes each in 0.2×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65° C. With respect to polynucleotide molecules having a length less than 100 bases, exemplary stringent hybridization conditions are 5 to 10° C. below Tm. On average, the Tm of a polynucleotide molecule of length less than 100 by is reduced by approximately (500/oligonucleotide length)° C. With respect to the DNA mimics known as peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) (Nielsen et al., Science. 1991 Dec. 6; 254(5037):1497-500) Tm values are higher than those for DNA-DNA or DNA-RNA hybrids, and can be calculated using the formula described in Giesen et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 1998 Nov. 1; 26(21):5004-6. Exemplary stringent hybridization conditions for a DNA-PNA hybrid having a length less than 100 bases are 5 to 10° C. below the Tm. Variant polynucleotides of the present invention, or used in the methods of the invention, also encompasses polynucleotides that differ from the sequences of the invention but that, as a consequence of the degeneracy of the genetic code, encode a polypeptide having similar activity to a polypeptide encoded by a polynucleotide of the present invention. A sequence alteration that does not change the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide is a “silent variation”. Except for ATG (methionine) and TGG (tryptophan), other codons for the same amino acid may be changed by art recognized techniques, e.g., to optimize codon expression in a particular host organism. Polynucleotide sequence alterations resulting in conservative substitutions of one or several amino acids in the encoded polypeptide sequence without significantly altering its biological activity are also included in the invention. A skilled artisan will be aware of methods for making phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions (see, e.g., Bowie et al., 1990, Science 247, 1306). Variant polynucleotides due to silent variations and conservative substitutions in the encoded polypeptide sequence may be determined using the publicly available bl2seq program from the BLAST suite of programs (version 2.2.5 [November 2002]) from the NCBI website on the World Wide Web at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/ via the tblastx algorithm as previously described. Polypeptide Variants The term “variant” with reference to polypeptides encompasses naturally occurring, recombinantly and synthetically produced polypeptides. Variant polypeptide sequences preferably exhibit at least 50%, more preferably at least 51%, more preferably at least 52%, more preferably at least 53%, more preferably at least 54%, more preferably at least 55%, more preferably at least 56%, more preferably at least 57%, more preferably at least 58%, more preferably at least 59%, more preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 61%, more preferably at least 62%, more preferably at least 63%, more preferably at least 64%, more preferably at least 65%, more preferably at least 66%, more preferably at least 67%, more preferably at least 68%, more preferably at least 69%, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 71%, more preferably at least 72%, more preferably at least 73%, more preferably at least 74%, more preferably at least 75%, more preferably at least 76%, more preferably at least 77%, more preferably at least 78%, more preferably at least 79%, more preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 81%, more preferably at least 82%, more preferably at least 83%, more preferably at least 84%, more preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 86%, more preferably at least 87%, more preferably at least 88%, more preferably at least 89%, more preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 91%, more preferably at least 92%, more preferably at least 93%, more preferably at least 94%, more preferably at least 95%, more preferably at least 96%, more preferably at least 97%, more preferably at least 98%, and most preferably at least 99% identity to a sequences of the present invention. Identity is found over a comparison window of at least 20 amino acid positions, preferably at least 50 amino acid positions, more preferably at least 100 amino acid positions, and most preferably over the entire length of a polypeptide of the invention. Polypeptide sequence identity can be determined in the following manner. The subject polypeptide sequence is compared to a candidate polypeptide sequence using BLASTP (from the BLAST suite of programs, version 2.2.5 [November 2002]) in bl2seq, which is publicly available from the NCBI website on the World Wide Web at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/. The default parameters of bl2seq are utilized except that filtering of low complexity regions should be turned off. Polypeptide sequence identity may also be calculated over the entire length of the overlap between a candidate and subject polynucleotide sequences using global sequence alignment programs. EMBOSS-needle (available at http:/www.ebi.ac.uk/emboss/align/) and GAP (Huang, X. (1994) On Global Sequence Alignment. Computer Applications in the Biosciences 10, 227-235.) as discussed above are also suitable global sequence alignment programs for calculating polypeptide sequence identity. A preferred method for calculating polypeptide % sequence identity is based on aligning sequences to be compared using Clustal X (Jeanmougin et al., 1998, Trends Biochem. Sci. 23, 403-5.) Polypeptide variants of the present invention, or used in the methods of the invention, also encompass those which exhibit a similarity to one or more of the specifically identified sequences that is likely to preserve the functional equivalence of those sequences and which could not reasonably be expected to have occurred by random chance. Such sequence similarity with respect to polypeptides may be determined using the publicly available bl2seq program from the BLAST suite of programs (version 2.2.5 [November 2002]) from the NCBI website on the World Wide Web at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/. The similarity of polypeptide sequences may be examined using the following unix command line parameters: bl2seq peptideseq1 -j peptideseq2 -F F -p blastp Variant polypeptide sequences preferably exhibit an E value of less than 1×10-6 more preferably less than 1×10-9, more preferably less than 1×10-12, more preferably less than 1×10-15, more preferably less than 1×10-18, more preferably less than 1×10-21, more preferably less than 1×10-30, more preferably less than 1×10-40, more preferably less than 1×10-50, more preferably less than 1×10-60, more preferably less than 1×10-70, more preferably less than 1×10-80, more preferably less than 1×10-90 and most preferably 1×10-100 when compared with any one of the specifically identified sequences. The parameter -F F turns off filtering of low complexity sections. The parameter -p selects the appropriate algorithm for the pair of sequences. This program finds regions of similarity between the sequences and for each such region reports an “E value” which is the expected number of times one could expect to see such a match by chance in a database of a fixed reference size containing random sequences. For small E values, much less than one, this is approximately the probability of such a random match. Conservative substitutions of one or several amino acids of a described polypeptide sequence without significantly altering its biological activity are also included in the invention. A skilled artisan will be aware of methods for making phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions (see, e.g., Bowie et al., 1990, Science 247, 1306). Constructs, Vectors and Components Thereof The term “genetic construct” refers to a polynucleotide molecule, usually double-stranded DNA, which may have inserted into it another polynucleotide molecule (the insert polynucleotide molecule) such as, but not limited to, a cDNA molecule. A genetic construct may contain the necessary elements that permit transcribing the insert polynucleotide molecule, and, optionally, translating the transcript into a polypeptide. The insert polynucleotide molecule may be derived from the host cell, or may be derived from a different cell or organism and/or may be a recombinant polynucleotide. Once inside the host cell the genetic construct may become integrated in the host chromosomal DNA. The genetic construct may be linked to a vector. The term “vector” refers to a polynucleotide molecule, usually double stranded DNA, which is used to transport the genetic construct into a host cell. The vector may be capable of replication in at least one additional host system, such as E. co/i. The term “expression construct” refers to a genetic construct that includes the necessary elements that permit transcribing the insert polynucleotide molecule, and, optionally, translating the transcript into a polypeptide. An expression construct typically comprises in a 5′ to 3′ direction: a) a promoter functional in the host cell into which the construct will be transformed,b) the polynucleotide to be expressed, andc) a terminator functional in the host cell into which the construct will be transformed. The term “coding region” or “open reading frame” (ORF) refers to the sense strand of a genomic DNA sequence or a cDNA sequence that is capable of producing a transcription product and/or a polypeptide under the control of appropriate regulatory sequences. The coding sequence may, in some cases, identified by the presence of a 5′ translation start codon and a 3′ translation stop codon. When inserted into a genetic construct, a “coding sequence” is capable of being expressed when it is operably linked to promoter and terminator sequences. “Operably-linked” means that the sequenced to be expressed is placed under the control of regulatory elements that include promoters, tissue-specific regulatory elements, temporal regulatory elements, enhancers, repressors and terminators. The term “noncoding region” refers to untranslated sequences that are upstream of the translational start site and downstream of the translational stop site. These sequences are also referred to respectively as the 5′ UTR and the 3′ UTR. These regions include elements required for transcription initiation and termination, mRNA stability, and for regulation of translation efficiency. Terminators are sequences, which terminate transcription, and are found in the 3′ untranslated ends of genes downstream of the translated sequence. Terminators are important determinants of mRNA stability and in some cases have been found to have spatial regulatory functions. The term “promoter” refers to nontranscribed cis-regulatory elements upstream of the coding region that regulate gene transcription. Promoters comprise cis-initiator elements which specify the transcription initiation site and conserved boxes such as the TATA box, and motifs that are bound by transcription factors. Introns within coding sequences can also regulate transcription and influence post-transcriptional processing (including splicing, capping and polyadenylation). A promoter may be homologous with respect to the polynucleotide to be expressed. This means that the promoter and polynucleotide are found operably linked in nature. Alternatively the promoter may be heterologous with respect to the polynucleotide to be expressed. This means that the promoter and the polynucleotide are not found operably linked in nature. In certain embodiments the chimeric DGAT1 polynucleotides/polypeptides of the invention may be advantageously expressed under the control of selected promoter sequences as described below.

Photosynthetic tissues of the plant include leaves, stems, shoots and above ground parts of the plant. Photosynthetic tissue preferred promoters include light regulated promoters. Light Regulated Promoters Numerous light regulated promoters are known to those skilled in the art and include for example chlorophyll a/b (Cab) binding protein promoters and Rubisco Small Subunit (SSU) promoters. An example of a light regulated promoter is found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,750,385. Light regulated in this context means light inducible or light induced. A “transgene” is a polynucleotide that is taken from one organism and introduced into a different organism by transformation. The transgene may be derived from the same species or from a different species as the species of the organism into which the transgene is introduced. Host Cells Host cells may be derived from, for example, bacterial, fungal, yeast, insect, mammalian, algal or plant organisms. Host cells may also be synthetic cells. Preferred host cells are eukaryotic cells. A particularly preferred host cell is a plant cell, particularly a plant cell in a vegetative tissue of a plant. A “transgenic plant” refers to a plant which contains new genetic material as a result of genetic manipulation or transformation. The new genetic material may be derived from a plant of the same species as the resulting transgenic plant or from a different species. Methods for Isolating or Producing Polynucleotides The polynucleotide molecules of the invention can be isolated by using a variety of techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. By way of example, such polypeptides can be isolated through use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) described in Mullis et al., Eds. 1994 The Polymerase Chain Reaction, Birkhauser, incorporated herein by reference. The polypeptides of the invention can be amplified using primers, as defined herein, derived from the polynucleotide sequences of the invention. Further methods for isolating polynucleotides of the invention include use of all, or portions of the polypeptides having the sequence set forth herein as hybridization probes. The technique of hybridizing labelled polynucleotide probes to polynucleotides immobilized on solid supports such as nitrocellulose filters or nylon membranes, can be used to screen the genomic or cDNA libraries. Exemplary hybridization and wash conditions are: hybridization for 20 hours at 65° C. in 5.0×SSC, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1×Denhardt's solution; washing (three washes of twenty minutes each at 55° C.) in 1.0×SSC, 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, and optionally one wash (for twenty minutes) in 0.5×SSC, 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, at 60° C. An optional further wash (for twenty minutes) can be conducted under conditions of 0.1×SSC, 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, at 60° C. The polynucleotide fragments of the invention may be produced by techniques well-known in the art such as restriction endonuclease digestion, oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR amplification. A partial polynucleotide sequence may be used, in methods well-known in the art to identify the corresponding full length polynucleotide sequence. Such methods include PCR-based methods, 5′RACE (Frohman M A, 1993, Methods Enzymol. 218: 340-56) and hybridization-based method, computer/database-based methods. Further, by way of example, inverse PCR permits acquisition of unknown sequences, flanking the polynucleotide sequences disclosed herein, starting with primers based on a known region (Triglia et al., 1998, Nucleic Acids Res 16, 8186, incorporated herein by reference). The method uses several restriction enzymes to generate a suitable fragment in the known region of a gene. The fragment is then circularized by intramolecular ligation and used as a PCR template. Divergent primers are designed from the known region. In order to physically assemble full-length clones, standard molecular biology approaches can be utilized (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1987). It may be beneficial, when producing a transgenic plant from a particular species, to transform such a plant with a sequence or sequences derived from that species. The benefit may be to alleviate public concerns regarding cross-species transformation in generating transgenic organisms. For these reasons among others, it is desirable to be able to identify and isolate orthologues of a particular gene in several different plant species. Variants (including orthologues) may be identified by the methods described. Methods for Identifying Variants Physical Methods Variant polypeptides may be identified using PCR-based methods (Mullis et al., Eds. 1994 The Polymerase Chain Reaction, Birkhauser). Typically, the polynucleotide sequence of a primer, useful to amplify variants of polynucleotide molecules of the invention by PCR, may be based on a sequence encoding a conserved region of the corresponding amino acid sequence. Alternatively library screening methods, well known to those skilled in the art, may be employed (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1987). When identifying variants of the probe sequence, hybridization and/or wash stringency will typically be reduced relatively to when exact sequence matches are sought. Polypeptide variants may also be identified by physical methods, for example by screening expression libraries using antibodies raised against polypeptides of the invention (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1987) or by identifying polypeptides from natural sources with the aid of such antibodies. Computer Based Methods The variant sequences of the invention, including both polynucleotide and polypeptide variants, may also be identified by computer-based methods well-known to those skilled in the art, using public domain sequence alignment algorithms and sequence similarity search tools to search sequence databases (public domain databases include Genbank, EMBL, Swiss-Prot, PIR and others). See, e.g., Nucleic Acids Res. 29: 1-10 and 11-16, 2001 for examples of online resources. Similarity searches retrieve and align target sequences for comparison with a sequence to be analyzed (i.e., a query sequence). Sequence comparison algorithms use scoring matrices to assign an overall score to each of the alignments. An exemplary family of programs useful for identifying variants in sequence databases is the BLAST suite of programs (version 2.2.5 [November 2002]) including BLASTN, BLASTP, BLASTX, tBLASTN and tBLASTX, which are publicly available from (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/) or from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), National Library of Medicine, Building 38A, Room 8N805, Bethesda, Md. 20894 USA. The NCBI server also provides the facility to use the programs to screen a number of publicly available sequence databases. BLASTN compares a nucleotide query sequence against a nucleotide sequence database. BLASTP compares an amino acid query sequence against a protein sequence database. BLASTX compares a nucleotide query sequence translated in all reading frames against a protein sequence database. tBLASTN compares a protein query sequence against a nucleotide sequence database dynamically translated in all reading frames. tBLASTX compares the six-frame translations of a nucleotide query sequence against the six-frame translations of a nucleotide sequence database. The BLAST programs may be used with default parameters or the parameters may be altered as required to refine the screen. The use of the BLAST family of algorithms, including BLASTN, BLASTP, and BLASTX, is described in the publication of Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 25: 3389-3402, 1997. The “hits” to one or more database sequences by a queried sequence produced by BLASTN, BLASTP, BLASTX, tBLASTN, tBLASTX, or a similar algorithm, align and identify similar portions of sequences. The hits are arranged in order of the degree of similarity and the length of sequence overlap. Hits to a database sequence generally represent an overlap over only a fraction of the sequence length of the queried sequence. The BLASTN, BLASTP, BLASTX, tBLASTN and tBLASTX algorithms also produce “Expect” values for alignments. The Expect value (E) indicates the number of hits one can “expect” to see by chance when searching a database of the same size containing random contiguous sequences. The Expect value is used as a significance threshold for determining whether the hit to a database indicates true similarity. For example, an E value of 0.1 assigned to a polynucleotide hit is interpreted as meaning that in a database of the size of the database screened, one might expect to see 0.1 matches over the aligned portion of the sequence with a similar score simply by chance. For sequences having an E value of 0.01 or less over aligned and matched portions, the probability of finding a match by chance in that database is 1% or less using the BLASTN, BLASTP, BLASTX, tBLASTN or tBLASTX algorithm. Multiple sequence alignments of a group of related sequences can be carried out with CLUSTALW (Thompson, J. D., Higgins, D. G. and Gibson, T. J. (1994) CLUSTALW: improving the sensitivity of progressive multiple sequence alignment through sequence weighting, positions-specific gap penalties and weight matrix choice. Nucleic Acids Research, 22:4673-4680, http://www-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/BioInfo/ClustalW/Top.html) or T-COFFEE (Cedric Notredame, Desmond G. Higgins, Jaap Heringa, T-Coffee: A novel method for fast and accurate multiple sequence alignment, J. Mol. Biol. (2000) 302: 205-217)) or PILEUP, which uses progressive, pairwise alignments. (Feng and Doolittle, 1987, J. Mol. Evol. 25, 351). Pattern recognition software applications are available for finding motifs or signature sequences. For example, MEME (Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation) finds motifs and signature sequences in a set of sequences, and MAST (Motif Alignment and Search Tool) uses these motifs to identify similar or the same motifs in query sequences. The MAST results are provided as a series of alignments with appropriate statistical data and a visual overview of the motifs found. MEME and MAST were developed at the University of California, San Diego. PROSITE (Bairoch and Bucher, 1994, Nucleic Acids Res. 22, 3583; Hofmann et al., 1999, Nucleic Acids Res. 27, 215) is a method of identifying the functions of uncharacterized proteins translated from genomic or cDNA sequences. The PROSITE database (www.expasy.org/prosite) contains biologically significant patterns and profiles and is designed so that it can be used with appropriate computational tools to assign a new sequence to a known family of proteins or to determine which known domain(s) are present in the sequence (Falquet et al., 2002, Nucleic Acids Res. 30, 235). Prosearch is a tool that can search SWISS-PROT and EMBL databases with a given sequence pattern or signature. Methods for Isolating Polypeptides The polypeptides of the invention, or used in the methods of the invention, including variant polypeptides, may be prepared using peptide synthesis methods well known in the art such as direct peptide synthesis using solid phase techniques (e.g. Stewart et al., 1969, in Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis, WH Freeman Co, San Francisco Calif., or automated synthesis, for example using an Applied Biosystems 431A Peptide Synthesizer (Foster City, Calif.). Mutated forms of the polypeptides may also be produced during such syntheses. The polypeptides and variant polypeptides of the invention, or used in the methods of the invention, may also be purified from natural sources using a variety of techniques that are well known in the art (e.g. Deutscher, 1990, Ed, Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 182, Guide to Protein Purification,). Alternatively the polypeptides and variant polypeptides of the invention, or used in the methods of the invention, may be expressed recombinantly in suitable host cells and separated from the cells as discussed below. Methods for Producing Constructs and Vectors The genetic constructs of the present invention comprise one or more polynucleotide sequences of the invention and/or polynucleotides encoding polypeptides of the invention, and may be useful for transforming, for example, bacterial, fungal, insect, mammalian or plant organisms. The genetic constructs of the invention are intended to include expression constructs as herein defined. Methods for producing and using genetic constructs and vectors are well known in the art and are described generally in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1987; Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing, 1987). Methods for Producing Host Cells Comprising Polynucleotides, Constructs or Vectors The invention provides a host cell which comprises a genetic construct or vector of the invention. Host cells comprising genetic constructs, such as expression constructs, of the invention are useful in methods well known in the art (e.g. Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1987; Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing, 1987) for recombinant production of polypeptides of the invention. Such methods may involve the culture of host cells in an appropriate medium in conditions suitable for or conducive to expression of a polypeptide of the invention. The expressed recombinant polypeptide, which may optionally be secreted into the culture, may then be separated from the medium, host cells or culture medium by methods well known in the art (e.g. Deutscher, Ed, 1990, Methods in Enzymology, Vol 182, Guide to Protein Purification). Methods for Producing Plant Cells and Plants Comprising Constructs and Vectors The invention further provides plant cells which comprise a genetic construct of the invention, and plant cells modified to alter expression of a polynucleotide or polypeptide of the invention, or used in the methods of the invention. Plants comprising such cells also form an aspect of the invention. Methods for transforming plant cells, plants and portions thereof with polypeptides are described in Draper et al., 1988, Plant Genetic Transformation and Gene Expression. A Laboratory Manual, Blackwell Sci. Pub. Oxford, p. 365; Potrykus and Spangenburg, 1995, Gene Transfer to Plants. Springer-Verlag, Berlin; and Gelvin et al., 1993, Plant Molecular Biol. Manual. Kluwer Acad. Pub. Dordrecht. A review of transgenic plants, including transformation techniques, is provided in Galun and Breiman, 1997, Transgenic Plants. Imperial College Press, London. Methods for Genetic Manipulation of Plants A number of plant transformation strategies are available (e.g. Birch, 1997, Ann Rev Plant Phys Plant Mol Biol, 48, 297, Helens R P, et al., (2000) Plant Mol Biol 42: 819-32, Helens R et al., Plant Meth 1: 13). For example, strategies may be designed to increase expression of a polynucleotide/polypeptide in a plant cell, organ and/or at a particular developmental stage where/when it is normally expressed or to ectopically express a polynucleotide/polypeptide in a cell, tissue, organ and/or at a particular developmental stage which/when it is not normally expressed. The expressed polynucleotide/polypeptide may be derived from the plant species to be transformed or may be derived from a different plant species. Transformation strategies may be designed to reduce expression of a polynucleotide/polypeptide in a plant cell, tissue, organ or at a particular developmental stage which/when it is normally expressed. Such strategies are known as gene silencing strategies. Genetic constructs for expression of genes in transgenic plants typically include promoters for driving the expression of one or more cloned polynucleotide, terminators and selectable marker sequences to detect presence of the genetic construct in the transformed plant. The promoters suitable for use in the constructs of this invention are functional in a cell, tissue or organ of a monocot or dicot plant and include cell-, tissue- and organ-specific promoters, cell cycle specific promoters, temporal promoters, inducible promoters, constitutive promoters that are active in most plant tissues, and recombinant promoters. Choice of promoter will depend upon the temporal and spatial expression of the cloned polynucleotide, so desired. The promoters may be those normally associated with a transgene of interest, or promoters which are derived from genes of other plants, viruses, and plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Those skilled in the art will, without undue experimentation, be able to select promoters that are suitable for use in modifying and modulating plant traits using genetic constructs comprising the polynucleotide sequences of the invention. Examples of constitutive plant promoters include the CaMV 35S promoter, the nopaline synthase promoter and the octopine synthase promoter, and the Ubi 1 promoter from maize. Plant promoters which are active in specific tissues respond to internal developmental signals or external abiotic or biotic stresses are described in the scientific literature. Exemplary promoters are described, e.g., in WO 02/00894 and WO2011/053169, which is herein incorporated by reference. Exemplary terminators that are commonly used in plant transformation genetic construct include, e.g., the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S terminator, the Agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase or octopine synthase terminators, the Zea mays zein gene terminator, the Oryza sativa ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase terminator and the Solanum tuberosum PI-II terminator. Selectable markers commonly used in plant transformation include the neomycin phophotransferase II gene (NPT II) which confers kanamycin resistance, the aadA gene, which confers spectinomycin and streptomycin resistance, the phosphinothricin acetyl transferase (bar gene) for Ignite (AgrEvo) and Basta (Hoechst) resistance, and the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (hpt) for hygromycin resistance. Use of genetic constructs comprising reporter genes (coding sequences which express an activity that is foreign to the host, usually an enzymatic activity and/or a visible signal (e.g., luciferase, GUS, GFP) which may be used for promoter expression analysis in plants and plant tissues are also contemplated. The reporter gene literature is reviewed in Herrera-Estrella et al., 1993, Nature 303, 209, and Schrott, 1995, In: Gene Transfer to Plants (Potrykus, T., Spangenberg. Eds) Springer Verlag.

EXAMPLES Example 1 Plant DGAT1 Sequence Selection and Splice Site Prediction The majority of nucleic acid sequences and peptide sequences for the plant type 1 DGATs can be found by accession number in public domain libraries (Table 1). For creating initial alignments we used ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994, Nucleic Acids Res., 22, 4673-4680); these were manually edited and used to create the models to search the DGAT sequences, using the HMMER2 package (HMMER 2.3.2 (October 2003) Copyright © 1992-2003 HHMI/Washington University School of Medicine, available from the World Wide Web at http://hmmer.org). Initial matching of protein sequences against genomic DNA with splice prediction was performed with the GeneWise package (Birney et al., 2004, Genome Res. 14: 988-995). Some of the sequences retrieved appeared to have errors; in particular incorrectly predicted splice sites which would result in internal deletions that would likely result in non-functional proteins. While both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous type 1 DGATs have 16 exons there are some differences in the position of the splicing. Exon 8 in the dicotyledonous DGAT1 gene corresponds to exons 8 and 9 in the monocotyledonous DGAT1 gene, while exon 14 in the monocotyledonous gene corresponds to exons 13 and 14 in the dicotyledonous gene. We have found that the most accurate method for determining the likely genuine coding sequence from genomic data has been to use Vector NTI Advance™ 11.0 (© 2008 Invitrogen Corporation) to translate the genome in the three forward reading frames and align these with demonstrated functional DGAT1s from dicotyledonous or monocotyledous species as appropriate (for example A. thaliana cDNA NM—127503, protein NP—179535 and Z. mays cDNA EU039830, protein ABV91586). The genomic sequence and corresponding exon/intron boundary positions for Arabidopsis thaliana encoding NP—179535 and Zea mays encoding ABV91586 that can be used as a template for determining other plant DGAT coding regions are shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, respectively. An example of this template use is shown for the determination of Z. mays DGAT1 SEQ ID NO: 10 and SEQ ID NO: 39.

These were engineered to have an internal XhoI site within exon 1 encoding the conserved N-terminal acyl-Co binding region (identified by Weselake 2006) without altering the amino acid sequence leucine-serine-serine (LSS). FIG. 3 shows alignment of a number of DGAT1 sequences from plants. The left box shows the position of the Acyl-CoA binding site. An EcoRI site was engineered upstream of the 5′ coding sequence while an XbaI site was placed downstream of the 3′ stop codon. The internal XhoI and flanking EcoRI and XbaI sites were used to generate chimeras between each of the original DGAT1 clones; essentially this fused the N-terminal reputed cytoplasmic region (based on Weselake et al 2006 and McFie et al, 2010) from one DGAT1 with the C-terminal ER luminal region of a different DGAT1. In some combinations this resulted in one amino acid change in the remaining cytoplasmic region downstream of the engineered XhoI site. The putative acyl-Co binding region the A. thaliana DGAT1, T. majus DGAT1, Z. mays-L DGAT1 and O. sativa-L DGAT1 have an identical amino acid sequence down stream of the XhoI site (LSSDAIFKQSHA). While in the Z. mays-S DGAT1and O. sativa-S DGAT1 the lysine (K) residue is replaced by an arginine (R) residue (LSSDAIFRQSHA). Since the position of this residue is located 3′ to the Xho I site encoded by LLS then chimeras deriving from one parent containing the lysine and one parent containing the arginine residue will effectively result in a substitution of this residue. This was considered to be a minimal disruption since both lysine and arginine are large, positively charged, hydrophilic, basic amino acids containing a free amine or guanidinium group, respectively at the end of an aliphatic side chain (FIG. 4). The complete list of N-terminal region/C-terminal region domain swapping constructs are found in Table 2, with the corresponding SEQ ID NO: 59-94.

Sequences were optimised for expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and flanked with appropriate incorporated appropriate restriction sites to facilitate the cloning into the pYES2.1 vector (Invitrogen). Example 3 Expression of Chimeric DGAT1 Sequences in Cells Expression of Constructs in S. cerevisiae The parent DGAT1 constructs and chimeric DGAT1 constructs were placed into the galactose-inducible yeast expression vector pYES2.1/V5-His TOPO® (Invitrogen). This resulted in the addition of an inframe C-terminal V5 epitope and 6× histidine tag. The name of the chimeric constructs and the number of their corresponding peptide sequences are shown in Table 2. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae quadruple mutant (H1246) in which all four neutral lipid biosynthesis genes have been disrupted (Sandager et al., 2002, The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 277:6478-6482) was transformed as per Elble (1992, BioTechniques 13, 18-20) and selected by the ability to grow in the absence of uracil. Routinely, yeast cells were grown aerobically overnight in a synthetic medium with 0.67% YNB, without uracil (SC-U) and containing 2% glucose. Cells from overnight culture were used to inoculate 200 mL of induction medium (SC-U containing 2% galactose and 1% raffinose) to an initial OD600 of 0.4. Cells were allowed to further grow at 30° C., with shaking at 200 rpm until late stationary phase, normally 48 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1500×g for 5 min, then cell pellets were washed with distilled water and either used immediately for subsequent analysis or kept in −80° C. until required. Cell pellets for neutral lipid extraction were freeze-dried for 48 h and stored in −20° C. freezer until required. Lipid Analysis of S. cerevisiae Approximately 10 mg of freeze-dried yeast cell material was accurately weighed then disrupted using glass beads by vortexing for 1 minute. This lysate was extracted in hot methanolic HCL for fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis (Browse et al., 1986, Anal. Biochem. 152, 141-145). For FA profile analysis approximately 50 mg freeze dried yeast was placed in a 13-mm screw cap tube, and an equal volume of glass beads added before vortexing at high speed in 3×1 min bursts. Following addition of 50 μg of 19:0 TAG internal standard, 2.4 mL of 0.17 M NaCl in MeOH was added and the mixture vortexed for 15 sec followed by the addition of then 4.8 mL of heptane and the entire contents mixed. The solution was then incubated in 80° C. water bath for 2 h without shaking. After incubation, the solution was cooled to room temperature. After cooling, the upper phase (lipidic phase) was transferred to fresh screw-cap tube and evaporated to dryness under stream of nitrogen gas. The dried residue was then dissolved in 1 mL heptane and mixed thoroughly for TAG SPE separation using Strata Si-1 Silica column (Phenomenwx, 8B-S012-EAK). After preconditioning with methanol and equilibrating the Silica column with heptanes the 1 mL TAG extract (including 50 μg 17:0 TAG Internal Standard was passed through the pre-equilibrated column, followed by 1.2 mL of heptane and then 2 mL of chloroform:heptane (1:9 v/v/) and the eluate collected. The total eluate collected was evaporated to dryness under the stream of N gas and the residue used for FAMEs extraction. FAMEs of Extracted TAG To the TAG residue above 10 μL of internal standard 15:0 FA (4 mg/mL dissolved in heptane) and 1 mL of methanolic HCl (1N) reagent containing 5% of 2,2-dimeethoxypropane (as water scavenger) were added. The tube was then flushed with N gas, then sealed immediately with Teflon-lined cap, and heated at 80° C. in a water bath for 1 h. After cooling down, 0.6 mL heptane and 1.0 mL of 0.9% (w/v) NaCl was added, the mixture vortexed then spun at 500 rpm for 1 min. From the top heptane layer, 100 μL was collected and transferred to a flat-bottom glass insert fitted into a vial for FAMES GC/MS analysis. Protein Extraction and Trypsin Digestion Yeast cell pellets were washed with lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF) then resuspended in 500 μL lysis buffer, glass beads were added and cells disrupted by vortexing 2× at medium speed for 30 seconds. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 1000×g for 5 min, the supernatant transferred to fresh tubes and total cellular membranes pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000×g for 1 h. Membrane proteins were resuspended in lysis buffer with or without detergent (1% Dodecyl maltoside) and quantified in a Qubit Fluorometer using the Qubit IT Quantitation Kit. Trypsin was added to give a final concentration of 25 μg/mL to 50 μL of protein extract and the mixture incubated at 30° C. for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of Trypsin inhibitor from Glycine max (Sigma-Aldrich catalogue # T6414) to a final concentration of 0.4 μ/μL. After addition of trypsin inhibitor, 4×SDS loading dye and 10× reducing agent (Invitrogen) were added, and the protein incubated at 70° C. for 10 min prior to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. The blot was probed with either Anti V5-HRP antibody (Cat #R96125, Invitrogen) at 1:2500 dilution, or anti Kar2 (y-115) antibody produced in rabbit (SC-33630, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:200 dilution. Anti Kar2 was used to detect the yeast protein Kar2, an ER luminaly-located protein (Rose et al., 1989, Cell 57, 1211-1221) which serves as a control to demonstrate the presence of intact microsomes. Example 4 Expression of Chimeric DGAT1 in Brassica napus The same strategy, as described in Example 2, was used to generate a variety of chimeric DGAT1 constructs for expression in the seeds of Brassica napus. This included the parent DGAT1s of T. majus DGAT1, Z. mays-L DGAT1 and Z. mays-S DGAT1 (amino acid SEQ ID NO: 34, 39 and 44 respectively, Table 1) optimised for expression in Brassica napus by GeneArt AG. The T. majus construct was engineered to contain a single point mutation S197A (Xu et al., 2008, Plant Biotechnology Journal, 6:799-818). All constructs were engineered to have an optimised Kozak, Arabidopsis thaliana UBQ10 intron, and tetranucleotide stop codon as per Scott et al., (2010, Plant Biotechnology Journal, 8:912-917) as indicated in Table 3 below. TABLE 3 DGAT1 Kozak, Parent intron, stop Residue SEQ Species codon modification ID NO: T. majus yes S197A 95 Z. mays-S yes none 96 Z. mays-L yes none 97 The same digestion pattern used to generate the chimeras for expression in S. cerevisiae (Example 2) were used on the B. Napus-optimised constructs to generate the chimeras Tm-ZmS; Tm-ZmL; ZmS-Tm(S170A); ZmL-Tm(S189A); resulting in the peptide sequences listed in Table 4 (Region 1 DGAT1 chimeras for expression in Brassica napus).

Plant Transformation B. napus (cv. DH12075) was transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens (GV3101) using the cotyledon co-cultivation method (adapted from that of Maloney et al., 1989, Plant Cell Rep. 8, 238-242). Control lines contained an empty-vector, and when identified, null sibling lines were subsequently used as true controls. Approximately 200 T0 transformed lines were produced and their corresponding T1 selfed seeds were analysed for oil content by GC. Approximately 50 individual transgenic lines (including control lines) were selected for the next generation (10 plants/line) based on their oil content, or seed weight (8 lines). A total of approximately T1 plants were grown and screened by PCR for copy number and identification of null sibing lines. T2 seeds were analysed in triplicate for oil content by NMR. Example 5 Expression of Chimeric DGAT1 in Camelina sativa The strategy above can also be used to generate a variety of chimeric DGAT1 constructs for expression in the seeds of Camelina sativa and other plants. Sequences with modifications were synthesised either by GENEART AG (Germany) or GeneScript (USA). Sequences were optimised for expression in Brassica species and included an intron (SEQ ID NO:105) from Arabidopsis thaliana DGAT1-intron 3. Each sequence was flanked with appropriate attL recombination sites to enable the cloning Gateway® adapted vectors.

Appl. Biochem. 53, 111-122) modified by replacement of the CaMV35S promoter replaced with the Brassica napes Napin promoter (SEQ ID NO:127). Camelina sativa Transformation C. sativa (cf. Calena) were transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens (GV3101) using the floral dip method (adapted from that of Clough and Bent, 1998, Plant J. 16(6):735-745). Essentially seeds were sown in potting mix in 10 cm pots in a controlled environment, approximately 6 weeks after planting the flowers were dipped for 5-14 minutes under vacuum (70-80 inch Hg) in an overnight culture of appropriated Agrobacterium GV3101 cells re-suspended in a floral dip buffer. After vacuum-transformation, plants were kept for 24 h under low light conditions by partly covering with a black plastic sheet. Vacuum transformations can be repeated three times at approximately 10-12 days intervals, corresponding to the flowering duration. Plants were grown in potting mix in a controlled environment (16-h day length, 21-24° C., 65-70% relative humidity). The T1 seeds produced can be collected and screened for transformants by germinating and growing seedlings at 22° C. with continuous light on a half-strength MS medium (pH 5.6) selection plate containing 1%(w/v) sucrose, 300 mg/L Timentin, and 25 mg/L DL-phosphinothricin to select for herbicide resistance. T2 selfed seed populations can also be screened by immuno blot for the presence of the V5 eptiope. T2 selfed seeds may be analysed for oil content by GC. Approximately 50 individual transgenic lines (including control lines) may be selected for the next generation (10 plants/line) based on their oil content, or seed weight. T2 plants may be grown and screened by PCR for copy number and identification of null sibing lines. T2 seeds may be analysed in triplicate for oil content by NMR or GC/MS. Results Swapping the N-Terminal Region of Plant DGAT1 s Enhances Lipid Production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae The N-terminal cytoplasmic region can be swapped between different plant DGAT1s to raise the lipid yield. Tables 5-11 show the lipid yields of a variety of chimeric DGAT1s in which the N-terminal cytoplasmic region has been derived from one plant DGAT1 while the remainder of the protein has been derived from another plant DGAT1. The lipid yields are presented either as grams of lipid produced per litre (which therefore compensates for any differences in growth rate) or have been normalised as a percentage of the lipid yield of the corresponding unmodified parent DGAT1. A comparison of parent DGAT1s and chimeric DGAT1s made using one donor parent for the N-terminal region, and a different donor parent for the N-terminal region are shown in Table 5. The lipid yields at 32 hr have been normalised against the highest lipid-producing parent (Z. mays-L) and are presented in ascending order. A comparison of T. majus parent DGAT1s and chimeric DGAT1s made using either T. majus as the donor parent for the N-terminal region or using T. majus as the donor parent for the C-terminal region are shown in Table 6. The lipid yields at 32 hr have been normalised against the lipid yield from the parent DGAT1 of the C-terminal region. A comparison of O. Sativa-L parent DGAT1s and chimeric DGAT1s made using either O. Sativa-L as the donor parent for the N-terminal region or using O.

In the examples given this is specifically seen as a relatively high level of 16:0 and 18:0 but low level of 18:1c9 in the TAG extracted from cells expressing DGAT1s in which the N-terminal region was derived from Arabidopsis thaliana. In contrast the TAG from cells expressing DGAT1s in which the N-terminal region was derived from O. sativa-L have relatively low levels of 16:0 and 18:0 but high levels of 18:1c9. While the TAG from cells expressing DGAT1s in which the N-terminal regions was derived from T. majus have intermediate levels of 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1c9.

More specifically they can be used to achieve higher levels of lipid accumulation in eukaryotic cells than can be achieved using unaltered DGAT1 proteins. They have also shown that by selecting to express specific chimeric DGAT1 proteins they can not only increase the lipid content of the eukaryotic cell but also alter the lipid profile within the accumulating TAG. There is discussion of producing chimeric plant DGAT1s in US 2012/0156360 A1. In Example 11, the authors describe two chimeras using the N-terminus from a maize DGAT1 and the C-terminus from a hazelnut DGAT1. However, the junction of the chimeras is in the putative transmembrane domain which is further downstream from the junction of the chimeras described by the present applicants. Furthermore, there is no data presented with respect to the activity of the chimeric plant DGAT1s in US 2012/0156360 A1. Thus there is no disclosure in US 2012/0156360 A1 of the chimeric DGAT1 molecules presented herein, or the altered activities specified, or use of the chimeras of the invention to produce the effects described herein. 1-48.
