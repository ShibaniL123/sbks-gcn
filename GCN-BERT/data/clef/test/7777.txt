In other embodiments of the invention, the salt is of the form Yx−Zn+x/n, wherein Yx− is as defined above, and Zn+ is a cation other than a cation of the form [NH2R3R4]+ as defined above, and n is a whole number greater than zero. In other embodiments of the invention, the hypochlorite is mixed with a nitrogen containing compound which is not a salt but is a compound Y per se as defined above, provided that the compound Y is not sulfamic acid, melamine, cyanuric acid, hydantoin, dialkyl hydantoin such as dimethyl hydantoin, biuret, succinamide, succinimide, creatine, or creatinine. As will be explained hereinbelow, in some embodiments of the invention, in forming the biocide the hypochlorite and nitrogen-containing compound or salt thereof are also mixed with a bromide. In FIG. 1, reservoir 4 contains a solution of hypochlorite, and reservoir 6 contains a solution of the nitrogen-containing compound or salt thereof. In some embodiments of the invention, the solution contained in reservoir 6 also comprises bromide. As shown in FIG. 1, water is fed from a source 8, shown in FIG. 1 as a reservoir 8 from which water is pumped by pump 70, via a water pipe 10 through parallel flow meters 72 and into a corresponding pair of branch lines 12, 14, which connect to a mixer 21 which feeds common outlet pipe 16 leading to medium 3 at the locations 2. A low-water flow switch 71 is operably connected to the flow indicator 72 of line 12. Outlet pipe 16 is equipped with a siphon breaker 86, and may also be equipped with a pH meter 47 to monitor the pH of the biocide. Pumps P1 and P2, which may be for example pusaltile pumps, peristaltic pumps, other types of pumps or the equivalents of pumps (such as venturis) as are known in the art, pump the hypochlorite and nitrogen-containing compound or salt thereof from reservoirs 4 and 6 respectively through lines 75 and 73 respectively into lines 14 and 12 at junction pieces 82 and 80, respectively. These junction pieces may be, for example, simple T-connectors, or they may be designed to facilitate mixing of the solutions from reservoirs 4 and 6 with the water flowing through lines 14 and 12. Between reservoirs 6 and 4 are calibration tubes 76 and 84 and valves 74. Thus, depending on the concentration of the components in reservoirs 4 and 6, the rate at which these components are pumped into lines 14 and 12 respectively, and the rate of flow of water through lines 12 and 14, the hypochlorite oxidant and nitrogen-containing compound or salt thereof may be diluted and mixed in desired proportions. The reaction product, namely the biocide produced by the reaction of the hypochlorite and nitrogen-containing compound or salt thereof, may thus be applied directly from outlet pipe 16 into the medium 3, within a brief time after the formation of the biocide. In alternative embodiments of the invention (not shown), mixer 21 is replaced by a ingress chamber or a junction piece, in which case the dilutions mix and react as they flow through outlet pipe 16, so that by the time the fluid flowing through outlet pipe 16 is introduced into the liquid 3, the biocide has been produced. In these alternative embodiments of the invention, outlet pipe 16 rather than mixer 21 functions as a mixing chamber. It will also be appreciated that although as depicted in FIG. 1, the solution of nitrogen-containing compound or salt thereof is diluted prior to mixing with the hypochlorite oxidant dilution, in those embodiments of the invention in which bromide is not employed, this solution need not be diluted prior to mixing with the hypochlorite dilution. Irrespective of whether the nitrogen-containing compound or salt thereof is diluted or not before mixing with the hypochlorite, the nitrogen-containing compound or salt thereof should be mixed with the hypochlorite oxidant in equimolar amounts or in a molar excess relative to the hypochlorite oxidant. It will also be appreciated that in some embodiments, the concentration of hypochlorite immediately prior to mixing with the nitrogen-containing compound or salt thereof does not exceed 24,000 ppm expressed as total chlorine, and that in some embodiments, the concentration of biocide prior to application to the medium does not exceed 12,000 ppm expressed as total chlorine. Irrespective whether or not a mixer 21 is utilized, the flow through outlet pipe 16 should be sufficiently fast that the biocide does not have time to decompose prior to introduction into the medium 3. In many embodiments of the invention, the time from which the diluted oxidant, nitrogen-containing compound or salt thereof, and if present, diluted bromide are mixed with each other to form the biocide until the biocide is injected from pipe 16 into medium 3 is three minutes or less. In some embodiments, the time is two-and-a-half minutes or less, in some embodiments the time is two minutes or less, in some embodiments the time is one-and-a-half minutes or less, in some embodiments the time is one minute or less, and in some embodiments the time is 30 seconds or less. In other embodiments of the invention in which the biocide is stable for more than a few minutes, the biocide may be stored (e.g. in a reservoir, not shown) prior to application to the medium. The two branch lines 12, 14 include control valves 22, 24, which enable the flow rate of the water through lines 12 and 14 to be controlled. The control of the foregoing valves and pumps may be done by a control system (not shown). Outlet line 16, therefore, may also include a pH sensor 47 for sensing the pH of the biocide, which may give feedback to the control system to enable control of biocide production in response thereto. The control system may control the supply of the water from source 8 via an electrical valve 48. The apparatus may also be configured with alarms or other signalling devices, such as flow switch 71, which may give feedback to the control system. The illustrated system may further include a timer (not shown) which is pre-settable to fix both the lengths of time for which the biocide is to be fed via the outlet line 16 to the medium to be treated, as well as the time intervals between such feedings of the biocide. The control system may also be operative to control the operation of mixer 21. The water supply line 10 from the water source 8 to the two branch lines 12, 14, may include additional control devices, such as a flow meter 58 for indicating the flow rate or flow volume. As indicated earlier, the solution in reservoir 4 comprises a hypochlorite oxidant, and the solution within reservoir 6 comprises at least one nitrogen-containing compound or salt thereof and, in some embodiments of the invention, bromide. When present, the bromide may be provided in any suitable form. In some embodiments of the invention, the bromide is provided as an alkali or alkaline earth metal bromide salt, such as lithium bromide, sodium bromide, potassium bromide, calcium bromide, magnesium bromide or hydrobromic acid. The oxidant may be chosen from alkali and alkaline earth metal hypochlorites, e.g. lithium hypochlorite, sodium hypochlorite, potassium hypochlorite, calcium hypchlorite or magnesium hypochlorite. In some embodiments of the invention, the biocide has a pH of at least 8.0 immediately prior to its application to medium 3. In some embodiments of the invention, the biocide has a pH of at least 9.5 immediately prior to its application to medium 3. In some embodiments of the invention, the biocide has a pH of at least 10.0 immediately prior to its injection into medium 3. In some embodiments of the invention, the biocide has a pH of at least 10.5 immediately prior to its application to medium 3. In some embodiments of the invention, the biocide has a pH of at least 11.0 immediately prior to its application to medium 3. In some embodiments of the invention, the biocide has a pH of not more than 11.5 immediately prior to its application to medium 3. In an embodiment of the invention, the biocide is applied at a rate to maintain in the biocide a stable pH of at least 8.0 as it is produced. FIG. 2 is similar to FIG. 1, with like numbers denoting elements of the system of FIG. 2 which are the same as in the system of FIG. 1 and which operate in the same way. In FIG. 2, only a single flow line 12 is used, and no mixer 21 is present. The solution from reservoir 4 is introduced into line 12 upstream of where the solution from reservoir 6 is introduced into the flow line. In this arrangement, the dilution of the nitrogen-containing compound or salt thereof, with or without bromide, may form in the presence of the oxidant dilution, as long as the molar ratio of nitrogen-containing compound or salt thereof to hypochlorite oxidant is at least 1:1. The dilutions mix as they flow through line 12 and out through pipe 16, which as shown in FIG. 2 constitutes a continuation of line 12. In variations of what is depicted in FIG. 1, bromide may be diluted and introduced into mixer 21 separately from the nitrogen-containing compound. In variations of what is depicted in FIG. 2, bromide may be introduced to line 12 separately from the nitrogen-containing compound, provided that the bromide not introduced into line 12 upstream of where the nitrogen-containing is introduced into line 12. It will be appreciated that in embodiments of the invention shown herein, the hypochlorite oxidant is diluted prior to mixing with the nitrogen-containing compound or salt thereof. In the context of this patent application, the term “effective”, when used in reference to a biocide, means that the biocide is capable of controlling microbial growth, as evidenced by the ability to kill at least 50% of the microorganism in a liquid test sample within 3 hours after administration, with a residual of biocide, expressed as total chlorine, of at least 0.5 ppm. In the present application, the term “duty cycle” will be understood to mean the ratio between (a) the amount of time a biocide is administered to the water to be treated and (b) the amount of time the biocide is not administered to the water to be treated. It will also be appreciated that in the context of biofilm control, in embodiments of the invention it may not be necessary to kill microorganisms within the biofilm in order to control the biofilm, and that biofilm control in such cases can be adduced from direct observation of reduction of the presence of biofilm, or from observation of, for example, reduced production of ATP, reduced production of catalase, or other measurable variables which can be correlated with biofilm control or improved operational efficiency of the system being treated. The present invention will be better understood through the following illustrative and non-limitative examples of embodiments thereof.

A suspension of microorganisms was prepared from a sample of pink slime removed from the surface of a paper machine. Microorganisms (MOs) were grown at 37° C. As controls, in each test (a) biocide was added to DI water only, and (b) a sample of medium was left untreated by biocide. In the following examples, biocides in accordance with embodiments of the present invention were prepared by simulating production of the biocides as described above. An appropriate volume of the solution containing the biocide was added to each test container, taking into account the final desired concentration of the biocide after addition to the test container. The decomposition rate of the biocidal active ingredient was monitored in the examples below by measuring the residue of total chlorine in the concentrate. Example 1 Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP) Using an ORP electrode (WTW), oxidation-reduction potentials were measured in accordance with G. Degramont, “Water Treatment Handbook”, Springer-Verlag, 1991, pp. 249-250, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In this example, four tests were conducted: Test 1: In accordance with U.S. Pat. No. 6,478,972 (“Shim”), sodium sulfamate (14.62 g sulfamic acid dissolved in 100 ml DI water containing 7.2 g NaOH) and sodium hypochlorite (10.5% w/v expressed as Cl2, commercial solution) were mixed (molar ratio of sulfamate to Cl2 1.007:1) to produce what Shim terms a “stabilized hypochlorite solution”. The resulting mixture was immediately added to each of the aqueous test systems, in defined volumes to maintain feed levels of 4.2, 8.4 and 12.6 ppm (expressed as total chlorine) respectively. Test 2: In accordance with Shim, sodium sulfamate (14.62 g sulfamic acid dissolved in 100 ml DI water containing 7.2 g NaOH) and sodium hypochlorite (10.5% w/v expressed as Cl2, commercial solution) were mixed (molar ratio of sulfamate to Cl2 1.007:1) to produce what Shim terms a “stabilized hypochlorite solution”. Sodium bromide (15.5% w/v) (molar ratio of Br− to Cl2 1.014:1) was mixed into the “stabilized hypochlorite solution”. A slight color change was noted as soon as NaBr was added to the “stabilized hypochlorite concentrate”. An appropriate volume of the resulting mixture was immediately added to each of the aqueous test systems, in defined volumes to maintain feed levels of 4.2, 8.4 and 12.6 ppm (expressed as total chlorine) respectively. Test 3: In accordance with Shim, sodium sulfamate (14.62 g sulfamic acid dissolved in 100 ml DI water) and sodium hypochlorite (10.5% w/v expressed as Cl2, commercial solution) were mixed (molar ratio of sulfamic acid to Cl2 1.007:1) to produce what Shim terms a “stabilized hypochlorite solution”. Sodium bromide (15.5% w/v) was mixed into the “stabilized hypochlorite solution” (molar ratio of Br− to Cl2 1.014:1) A significant color change was noted as soon as NaBr was added to the “stabilized hypochlorite solution”. The resulting mixture was immediately added to each of the aqueous test systems, in defined volumes to maintain feed levels of 4.2, 8.4, and 12.6 ppm (expressed as total chlorine) respectively. Test 4: In accordance with Shim, sulfamic acid (14.62 g in 100 ml DI water) and sodium hypochlorite (10.5% w/v expressed as Cl2, commercial solution) were mixed. The mixture was immediately added to each of the aqueous test systems, in defined volumes to maintain feed levels of 4.2, 8.4 and 12.6 ppm (expressed as total chlorine) respectively. NaBr (15.5% w/v, molar ratio of Br− to Cl2 1.014:1) was simultaneously added separately to the aqueous system. In tests 2, 3 and 4, ORP was measured two hours after the biocide was added to the aqueous system. The results are presented in Table 1, where ppm refers to the biocide feed level, expressed as Cl2: TABLE 1 ORP (millivolts) Treatment test 4 test 2 test 3 8.4 ppm, DI only 340 405 420 4.2 ppm 238 310 348 8.4 ppm 231 294 330 12.6 ppm 250 284 295 0 ppm 200 200 200 The results in Table 1 show that the order and mode of addition of the chemicals in the method of Shim is significant, as is the identity of the chemicals. Example 2 Residual Total Chlorine Residual total chlorine in the aqueous system was measured 10 minutes and 24 hours after addition of biocide, using the DPD colorimetric method (see “Standard Methods for Examination of Waste and Waste Water”, 17th Edition (1989), pp. 4-62 to 4-64, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). As is known in the art, the rate of degradation of an oxidizer in an aqueous system is system-specific, i.e. the degradation rate of a given oxidizer is reproducible in a given aqueous system. Test 4 is the same Test 4 conducted in Example 1. Test 5: In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, sodium sulfamate (14.62 g sulfamic acid dissolved in 100 ml DI water containing 7.2 g NaOH) was mixed with NaBr (15.5 g in 100 ml DI water) (sodium sulfamate and NaBr both equimolar to sodium hypochlorite) and diluted in DI water. Sodium hypochlorite (10.5% w/v, expressed as Cl2) was diluted in DI water (to a concentration of 4200 ppm, 0.42% w/v expressed as Cl2, equimolar to sulfamate and to bromide ion). The two diluted solutions were mixed according to the procedure described above. The biocide was immediately added to the aqueous system at a feed level of 2.1, 4.2 and 6.3 ppm expressed as total chlorine. The results are presented in Table 2 (presented as total chlorine as percent of feed). TABLE 2 Total Cl2 (as % of feed) test 4 - test 4 - test 5 - test 5 - treatment 10 min 24 hours 10 min 24 hours 8.4 ppm, DI 48.8 53.6 4.2 ppm, DI 119.05 107.1 2.1 ppm 42.86 2.4 4.2 ppm 31 19.05 57.14 50 6.3 ppm 71.4 57.1 8.4 ppm 29.8 27.4 12.6 ppm 39.7 34.1 *In the control samples in which biocide treatment was 0 ppm, the total Cl2 was 0 ppm after both 10 minutes and 24 hours. These results show that biocide formed according to Shim et al. is different than biocide formed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Example 3 Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) Concentration ATP levels serve as a measure for the biochemical activity of microorganisms, and as such serve as a good model for the viability of a microbial culture after it has been exposed to a biocide. Thus, in the aqueous system of Tests 4 and 5 described above, the concentration of ATP was measured 20 minutes after the addition of the biocide. The results are presented in Table 3. TABLE 3 test 4 test 5 treatment ATP (ng/ml) ATP (ng/ml) 2.1 ppm 0.58 4.2 ppm 0.75 0.53 6.3 ppm 0.44 8.4 ppm 0.7 12.6 ppm 0.56 0 ppm 0.61 0.61 The results presented in Table 3 show that after a contact time of 20 minutes, the biocide produced according to the procedure of Shim et al. (sodium hypochlorite stabilized with sulfamic acid added to water to be treated, then NaBr added thereafter to the water to be treated) is less effective in controlling microbial activity than the biocide produced in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention from sodium sulfamate, sodium bromide and sodium hypochlorite. This result is in accordance with the data presented by Shim, who states that antimicrobial efficacy of his product occurs only 24 hours or more after administration to the water to be treated. Example 4 Total Aerobic Counts General procedure for conducting viable count tests in this and other examples, unless noted otherwise: 10-fold serial dilutions of each of the following aqueous system test samples in sterile saline containing sodium thiosulfate were prepared 30 minutes after the biocide was added to the aqueous systems; the resulting serially ten-fold diluted solutions were mixed in the appropriate agar; colonies in the agar were counted after 48 hours incubation at 30° C., and are presented as cfu/ml. Test 5 is the same test 5 conducted in Examples 2 and 3 above. Test 6: A biocide was prepared by diluting a solution of sodium sulfamate (prepared from 14.62 g sodium sulfamate in 100 ml DI water containing 7.2 g NaOH, 5850 ppm) in DI water to produce a dilution equimolar to 4200 ppm chlorine, diluting sodium hypochlorite in DI water (to a concentration of 4200 ppm, 0.42% w/v), mixing the two dilutions and immediately adding an appropriate volume of the mixture to the aqueous system to be treated, as described above. Samples for viable counts of aerobic MOs were taken after a contact time of 30 minutes. Results of Tests 5 and 6 are presented in Tables 4 and 4A. TABLE 4 treatment Test 6 test 5 dosage, Cl2 Aerobic cfu/ml aerobic cfu/ml 2.1 ppm 1.30 × 105 5.86 × 104 0 ppm 1.30 × 105 1.30 × 105 cfu = colony forming units TABLE 4A treatment Test 6 test 5 dosage, Cl2 aerobic cfu/ml (% kill) Aerobic cfu/ml (% kill) 2.1 ppm 0% 55% The results in Tables 4 and 4A demonstrate that producing a biocide by first producing a dilute mixture of bromide and sulfamate, then mixing this mixture with dilute hypochlorite and injecting the product into the liquid to be treated, while ensuring that there is no excess oxidant (hypochlorite) during the production of the biocide, yields a more efficacious biocide than does mixing a dilute sulfamate with dilute hypochlorite and injecting the product into the liquid to be treated. Example 5 Viable Counts in Media Containing High Sugars Test 7: A biocide was prepared by dissolving guanidinium sulfate in DI water (0.647 g guanidinium sulfate (MW 216.22) in 100 ml DI water), diluting sodium hypochlorite in DI water (to a concentration of 4200 ppm, 0.42% w/v expressed as Cl2), mixing the two dilutions and immediately adding an appropriate volume of the mixture to the aqueous system to be treated, as described above. Test 8: A biocide was prepared by mixing guanidinium sulfate (0.647 g) with NaBr (0.62 g, NaBr equimolar to sodium hypochlorite) in 100 ml DI water, diluting sodium hypochlorite in DI water (to a concentration of 4200 ppm, 0.42% w/v expressed as Cl2), mixing the two dilutions and immediately adding an appropriate volume of the mixture to the aqueous system to be treated. The results are shown in Table 5, which shows the number of sugar-consuming colony forming units (cfu), and Table 5A, which present the same data as % survival relative to the non-biocide treated control. TABLE 5 Test 7 test 8 treatment Sugar cfu/ml sugar cfu/ml 4.2 ppm, DI only 0 0 2.1 ppm 9.20 × 102 3.30 × 102 4.2 ppm 9.80 × 102 4.00 × 10 6.3 ppm 8.00 × 10 5.00 × 10 0 ppm 1.06 × 104 1.06 × 104 TABLE 5A Test 7 test 8 treatment sugar cfu/ml % survival sugar cfu/ml % survival 2.1 ppm 8.68 3.11 4.2 ppm 9.25 0.38 6.3 ppm 0.75 0.42 0 ppm 100.00 100.00 The results in Tables 5 and 5A demonstrate that under the conditions described, biocide produced by mixing guanidinium sulfate with dilute hypochlorite is less efficacious than biocide produced by first mixing guanidium sulfate and sodium bromide, and then mixing this mixture with dilute hypochlorite. Example 6 Efficiency of Production of the Biocide Residual total chlorine was measured in all of the control tests (biocide in DI water) of Tests 1-6 described above. The results are presented in Table 6. TABLE 6 % Cl2 - 10 min % Cl2 - 20 Hours test 1 (Shim et al.) 59.5 54.8 test 2 (Shim et al.) 40.5 26.2 test 3 (Shim et al.) 48.8 38.1 test 4 (Shim et al.) 48.8 54.9 test 5 119 107.1 test 6 88.1 78.6 The results in Table 6 show that the “stabilized hypochlorite” and biocides produced in accordance with Shim et al. have a low initial residue compared to biocides formed in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. This demonstrates degradation of the biocide of Shim et al. during its production. In several instances the biocides produced by the method of Shim et al. also degrade faster during the first 20 hours after addition to the water to be treated. Series 2 Reaction media were similar to the media described in Series 1. Example 7 Comparison of Treatment of Aerobic and Anaerobic Bacteria Using Ammonium Carbamate and Ammonium Carbonate Biocides were prepared from sodium hypochlorite and either ammonium carbamate or ammonium carbonate in the presence and absence of sodium bromide, as described hereinbelow, and immediately added to the samples to be treated. The test containers were inoculated with MOs 48 hours prior to addition of biocide. Ammonium carbonate solution was prepared in DI water (11.71 g ammonium carbonate in 100 ml DI water) and further diluted in DI water to a final concentration of 4680 ppm. Sodium hypochlorite was diluted in DI water (to a concentration of 4200 ppm, 0.42% w/v expressed as total chlorine). As described above, the dilutions were mixed to provide equimolar amounts of hypochlorite and ammonium carbonate to form a biocide (2100 ppm as total chlorine), appropriate volumes of which were immediately added to the test containers. In an analogous manner, ammonium carbamate was prepared in DI water (11.71 g ammonium carbamate in 100 ml DI water) and further diluted in DI water to a concentration of 4680 ppm, and mixed with a dilute solution of sodium hypochlorite (4200 ppm, 0.46% w/v expressed as total chlorine), and appropriate volumes of the resulting biocide (2100 ppm as total chlorine) were immediately added to the test containers. ATP was measured 25 minutes and 120 minutes after feeding the biocide. Residual total chlorine was measured 5 minutes after feeding the biocide, and samples for viable counts were taken after 30 minutes contact time. The tests were repeated, this time with mixing of sodium bromide (6200 ppm) with the ammonium carbonate or ammonium carbamate prior to mixing with the sodium hypochlorite. Counts of ATP, total aerobic bacteria, growth on a high sugar growth medium, and killing of anaerobic bacteria were measured. The results are presented in Tables 7A-7E.

The pH was adjusted with HCl to 8.23. As described in earlier examples, biocides were prepared as follows: Test 9: Sulfamic acid solution (14.62 g sulfamic acid in 100 ml DI water) was diluted (4 ml of solution in 100 ml DI water) and NH3 (0.5 ml, 25% w/v in water) was added. Diluted NaOCl (4 ml of a solution containing 14% w/v NaOCl as Cl2 were diluted in 100 ml DI water) was mixed with the diluted sulfamic acid. Test 10: Ammonium sulfate solution (19.8 g/100 ml DI water) was diluted (2 ml of solution/100 ml DI water). NaOCl solution (14% w/v as Cl2 in water) was diluted in DI water (4 ml of solution/100 ml), and mixed with the diluted ammonium sulfate solution. Test 11: Sulfamic acid solution (14.62 g/100 ml DI water) was diluted (4 ml solution/100 ml DI water) and mixed with diluted NaOCl (4 ml of 14% w/v as Cl2 NaOCl solution/100 ml DI water). Test 12: Ammonium carbamate solution (11.55 g/100 ml DI water) was diluted (4 ml solution/100 ml DI water) and mixed with diluted NaOCl (4 ml of 14% w/v as Cl2 NaOCl solution/100 ml DI water). In tests 9-12, an appropriate volume of the resulting biocide was immediately added to water containing MOs from pink slime, as described above, and the total residual chlorine in the treated water/medium was measured after 5 minutes and 12 hours. Results are presented in Tables 8A and 8B.

The biocide derived from sulfamic acid remained stable and exhibited high residual total chlorine after 12 hours. ATP values for MOs growing on growth medium treated with the biocides produced in Tests 9-12 were obtained 30 minutes and 12 hours after addition of biocide to the growth medium. The results are shown in Tables 8C and 8D.

A feed level of 2.8 ppm as total chlorine was ineffective for biocide formed from sulfamic acid, despite the higher residual left in the process water. At 2.8 ppm, better control was achieved with ammonium sulfate compared to sodium sulfamate, and still better control with ammonium carbamate after 30 minutes as well as after 12 hours. The test samples of Tests 9-12 were checked for viable counts of aerobic, anaerobic and high-sugar MOs (cfu/ml) after a contact time of 30 minutes. The results are presented in Tables 8E-8G.

The biocide produced from ammonium carbamate was superior to the other biocides tested in controlling aerobic MOs. Series 4 Example 9 Comparison of Biocidal Properties of Biocides Prepared from Different Nitrogen-Containing Compounds or Salts Test medium A: 500 ml of contaminated clay suspension and 200 ml of cooked starch was mixed with 5 liters of tap water and inoculated with biofilm removed from a paper mill surface area. Test medium B: 0.46 g sodium sulfide was added to 2 liters of the clay slurry of Test medium A. Due to the high turbidity of the samples, reliable measurement of residual total chlorine was not possible. Qualitative measure of total chlorine confirmed that most of the biocide was consumed by this test medium. Samples for viable counts were removed after a contact time of 1 hour.
