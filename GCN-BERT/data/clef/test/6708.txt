BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE Field of the Disclosure The disclosure relates to bedding devices and more particularly pertains to a new bedding device for facilitating putting sheets onto a mattress. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE An embodiment of the disclosure meets the needs presented above by generally comprising a fitted sheet having a gathered perimeter edge wherein the fitted sheet is configured for coupling to a mattress such that the fitted sheet extends over a top surface of the mattress. A top sheet has a foot section and a head section. The foot section has a peripheral edge coupled to the fitted sheet in spaced relationship to the perimeter edge of the fitted sheet such that the foot section of the top sheet and the fitted sheet define a pocket configured for receiving legs of a person lying on the mattress. There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the disclosure in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional features of the disclosure that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto. The objects of the disclosure, along with the various features of novelty which characterize the disclosure, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The disclosure will be better understood and objects other than those set forth above will become apparent when consideration is given to the following detailed description thereof. Such description makes reference to the annexed drawings wherein: FIG. 1 is a top front side perspective view of a combination fitted and top sheet bedding device according to an embodiment of the disclosure. FIG. 2 is a top view of an embodiment of the disclosure. FIG. 3 is a top front side perspective view of an embodiment of the disclosure in use. FIG. 4 is a top front side perspective view of an embodiment of the disclosure. FIG. 5 is a bottom view of an embodiment of the disclosure. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIGS. 1 through 5 thereof, a new bedding device embodying the principles and concepts of an embodiment of the disclosure and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described. As best illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 5, the combination fitted and top sheet bedding device 10 generally comprises a fitted sheet 12 having a perimeter edge 14 which is gathered wherein the fitted sheet 12 is configured for coupling to a mattress 16 such that the fitted sheet 12 extends over a top surface 18 of the mattress 16 in a conventional manner. The perimeter edge 14 may be gathered in a conventional manner including an elastic band or the like coupled to the fitted sheet 12 within a hem. A top sheet 20 has a foot section 22 and a head section 24. The foot section 22 has a peripheral edge 26 coupled to the fitted sheet 12 in spaced relationship to the perimeter edge 14 of the fitted sheet 12 such that the foot section 22 of the top sheet 20 and the fitted sheet 12 define a pocket 28 configured for receiving legs 30 of a person 32 lying on the mattress 16 on top of the fitted sheet 12. The head section 24 of the top sheet 20 has a free outer edge 34 relative to the fitted sheet 12. The head section 24 has a medial portion 36 aligned with the foot section 22. The head section 24 further has a pair of outer portions 38. Each of the outer portions 38 extends laterally outward from a respective side of the medial portion 36 of the head section 24 wherein the outer portions 38 extend laterally outward relative to the foot section 22 and may overlap and hang down sides 40 of the mattress 16. A blanket 42 may be coupled to the fitted sheet 12 and the top sheet 20 such that the top sheet 20 is positioned between the fitted sheet 12 and the blanket 42. The blanket 42 has a coupled edge 44 coextensive with the peripheral edge 26 of the foot section 22. The coupled edge 44 may also extend partially along the peripheral edge 26 as opposed to a full length of the peripheral edge 26. The blanket 42 is similarly structured and sized with respect to the top sheet 20 wherein the blanket 42 is coextensive with and covers the top sheet 20. As shown in FIG. 4, the top sheet 20 and blanket 42 may each have a length greater than the mattress 16 wherein each may be folded over onto the mattress 16 as shown in FIG. 3. In use, coupling of the fitted sheet 12 on the mattress 16 simultaneously couples the top sheet 20 and blanket 42 on the mattress 16. Thus, attachment of the fitted sheet 12 facilitates placement of a complete bedding set on the mattress 16. With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure. Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the disclosure to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the disclosure. 1.
