GOVERNMENT SUPPORT This invention was made with government support under grant number R01 AI 51351 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The development of multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus infections is an increasing concern for the global health community. Infection caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is becoming increasingly difficult to treat with conventional antibiotics, leading to a sharp rise in clinical complications. The gram-positive microbe, Bacillus anthracis, is the etiologic agent of anthrax, a disease common to livestock but also considered to be a primary biological warfare and bioterrorism threat to humans worldwide. Humans can be infected by exposure to spores or to infected animals or their waste products. Prompt medical attention of anthrax infections is required, and typically effective, by treatment with penicillin G, doxycycline, or the quinolone ciprofloxacin. If untreated, death usually results within several days to a week. There is growing concern that B. anthracis is developing resistance to the common drugs that are used to treat the disease, and new antibiotics possessing a different mode of action are urgently needed. The discovery of N-alkylthio β-lactams in the Turos group has opened a new pathway in the development of potent anti-infectives (Turos, E. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2005, 13:6289-6308; Long, T. E. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2003, 11:1859-1863; Turos, E. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2002, 12:2229-2231). While the initial results have been exciting, much of their mode of action remains to be completely understood. Long (“N-thiolated β-lactams: Chemistry and biology of a novel class of antimicrobial agents for MRSA” University of South Florida Dissertation, 2003) and Heldreth (“N-thiolated beta-lactams: Chemistry, SAR and intracellular target of a novel class of antimicrobial and anticancer agents” University of South Florida Dissertation, 2004) were able to show that a disulfide-forming thiol transfer to intracellular thiols such as coenzyme A or glutathione was a key metabolic pathway for this class of compounds. Further, it was demonstrated that these drugs are most effective in those strains of bacteria where coenzyme A is present in high concentrations relative to other cytosolic thiols (Long, T. “N-thiolated β-lactams: Chemistry and biology of a novel class of antimicrobial agents for MRSA” University of South Florida Dissertation, 2003; Newton, G. L. et al. J. Bacteriology, 1996, 178(7):1990-1995), and, thus, where mixed CoA disulfides are produced within the cells (see scheme of thiol transfer from β-lactam to CoA in FIG. 1A). Although the abundance of CoA in Staphylococcus and Bacillus stems from its role within the thiol-redox buffer of these strains (Kaleidagraph, version 3.5.1.0, available from Synergy Software), the thiol-redox buffer is not directly affected by reaction of the N-alkylthio β-lactams with CoA. Although CoA disulfide reductase was ruled out as an enzymatic target, at least one of the two key mechanistic postulates is likely still valid: 1.) The CoA mixed disulfide produced by reaction of CoA with the N-alkylthio β-lactams acts as an inhibitor of a CoA-selective enzyme. 2.) The N-alkylthio β-lactams are actually the active molecules, and the thiol-transfer reaction of CoA functions as a natural defense mechanism. If postulate (1) is correct, it stands to reason that a large number of enzymatic pathways may be affected, since CoA is reported to be involved with approximately four percent of all known enzymatic reactions (Lee, C-H. and Chen, A. F. “Immobilized coenzymes and derivatives” in The Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes, Everse, J. et al. Eds, New York: Academic Press, 1982). Nonetheless, the elucidation of individual pathways is important to the further development of these valuable compounds. N-Alkylthio β-Lactams and Fatty Acid Synthesis Recent experiments conducted by Dr. Seyoung Jang of the Turos group demonstrated that treatment of S. aureus with lactam 8 (FIG. 2) greatly reduced uptake of radiolabeled acetate (as shown by the graph in FIG. 3) (Leonardi, R. et al. J. Biol. Chem., 2005, 280:3314-3322; Slater-Radosti, C. et al. Antimicrobial Chemother., 2001, 48:1-6; Higgins, D. L. et al. Antimicro. Agents Chemother., 2005, 49(3):1127-1134; Bligh, E. G. and Dyer, W. J. Can. J. Biochem. Phys., 1959, 37:911-197). This reduction in uptake suggests that a key mechanistic pathway of the N-alkylthio β-lactams is the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis. Bacterial fatty acid synthesis, often called Type II FAS, has been a target for antibiotics development for nearly a decade (Marrakchi, H. et al. Biochem. Sco. Trans., 2002, 30(6):1050-1055; Campbell, J. W. and Cronan, J. E. Ann. Rev. Microbiol., 2001, 55:305-352; Cronan, J. E., Jr. and Rock, C. O. in E. Coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology (Neidhardt, F. C. et al. Eds.), Washington, D.C.: American Society for Microbiology, 1996; Rock, C. O. and Cronan, J. E., Jr. Biochim. Biophys. Acta., 1996, 1302:1-16; Heath, R. J. and Rock, C. O. J. Biol. Chem., 1996, 271(18):10996-11000; Daines, R. A. et al. J. Med. Chem., 2003, 46:5-8; Jones, P. B. et al. J. Med. Chem., 2000, 43:3304-3314; He, X. and Reynolds, K. A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 2002, 46(5):1310-1318; Jones, P. B. et al. J. Med. Chem., 2000, 43:3304-3314; Nie, Z. et al. J. Med. Chem., 2005, 48:1596-1609; He, X. et al. Antimicro. Agents Chemother., 2004, 48:3093-3102; Choi, K-H. et al. J. Bacteriology, 2000, 182(2):365-370). Unlike mammalian (Type I) FAS, which operates through a multienzyme complex (Voet, D. and Voet, G. Biochemistry, 3rd Ed., John Wiley and Sons: Hoboken, N.J., 2004), bacterial FAS utilizes a series of discreet enzymes. This key difference opens opportunities for the development of inhibitors which are selective for Type II FAS (Marrakchi, H. et al. Biochem. Sco. Trans., 2002, 30(6):1050-1055). Type II FAS is depicted in the scheme of FIG. 4 (Marrakchi, H. et al. Biochem. Sco. Trans., 2002, 30(6):1050-1055; Voet, D. and Voet, G. Biochemistry, 3rd Ed., John Wiley and Sons: Hoboken, N.J., 2004). The synthetic cycle represents a recurring sequence of condensation (two-carbon elongation), reduction, dehydration, and reduction. Throughout the fatty acid cycle, the acyl substrates are carried from enzyme to enzyme by the acyl carrier protein (FIG. 5). This small protein contains a pantethine/thiol arm identical to that of CoA. Within this cycle, only two enzymes, malonyl/acetyl-CoA-ACP transacylase (MAT) and β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III (FabH) utilize a CoA derivative. Of the two possible enzymes, FabH seemed the logical first choice for exploration: first because of its role as the initial condensing enzyme in the FAS cascade, and secondly because FabH has already been purified from several species and its mode of action extensively studied (Marrakchi, H. et al. Biochem. Sco. Trans., 2002, 30(6):1050-1055; He, X. and Reynolds, K. A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 2002, 46(5):1310-1318; Qui, X. et al. Protein Sci., 2005, 14:2087-2094; Davies, C. et al. Structure, 2000, 8:185-195; Scarsdale, J. N. et al. J. Biol. Chem., 2001, 276(23):20516-20522; Li, Y. et al. J. Bacteriol., 2004, 187:3795-3799). The FabH active site contains a single cysteine residue located within a lipophilic pocket. Following binding of acetyl CoA, acetyl transfer from CoA to the active-site cysteine produces an S-acetyl cysteine and free CoA. Malonyl ACP then binds to the enzyme and undergoes a condensation reaction with the S-acetyl cysteine, with concurrent loss of CO2. Elimination of the cysteine produces β-ketobutanoyl-ACP, which is carried into the rest of the fatty acid cycle (FIG. 6). Based on this mechanism, the inhibition of FabH by a CoA mixed disulfide was visualized. It was hypothesized by the present inventors that this inhibition involves not only a noncovalent inhibition by occupation of the binding pocket, but also a potentially irreversible inhibition via transfer of the alkylthio moiety to the active site cysteine of the FabH enzyme (FIGS. 1A-1B). In order to explore these possibilities, it was proposed that a set of CoA mixed disulfides be tested for inhibitory activity against FabH. And, since it was possible that the N-alkylthio β-lactams might interact directly with this enzyme, compounds 2a and 2g (FIGS. 7A and 7B, respectively) were also tested against FabH. For the past decade, there has been considerable interest in the development of FabH inhibitors (Marrakchi, H. et al. Biochem. Sco. Trans., 2002, 30(6):1050-1055; Campbell, J. W. and Cronan, J. E. Ann. Rev. Microbiol., 2001, 55:305-352; Daines, R. A. et al. J. Med. Chem., 2003, 46:5-8; Qui, X. et al., Protein Science, 2005, 14:2087-2094; Jones, P. B. et al. J. Med. Chem., 2000, 43:3304-3314; He, X. and Reynolds, K. A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 2002, 46(5):1310-1318). The key role of this enzyme in Type II fatty acid synthesis, as well as the differences between bacterial and mammalian FAS, make FabH a desirable target for the inhibition of bacterial growth (Marrakchi, H. et al. Biochem. Sco. Trans., 2002, 30(6):1050-1055; Campbell, J. W. and Cronan, J. E. Ann. Rev. Microbiol., 2001, 55:305-352). It has recently reported that compounds such as the N-alkylthio β-lactams (FIG. 78A) (Turos, E. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2002, 12:2229-2231; Turos, E. et al. Tetrahedron, 2000, 56:5571-5578; Turos, E. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2005, 13:6289-6308; Coates, C. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2003, 11:193-196; Long, T. E. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2003, 11:1859-1863; Turos, E. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2002, 12:2229-2231; Heldreth, B. et al. Bioorg. and Med. Chem., 2006, 14:3775-3784) and N-alkylthio-2-oxazolidinones (FIG. 78B) (Mishra, R. K. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2006, 16(8):2081-2083) are able to inhibit the proliferation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Bacillus anthracis. A major pathway for this inhibition involves thiol-transfer to Coenzyme A to produce an alkyl-CoA mixed disulfide (5 in the scheme of FIG. 79). Experimental evidence suggests that the resulting aryl-alkyl disulfide may inhibit FabH (6 in the scheme of FIG. 79) by reversibly “capping” the active site cysteine through a thiol-disulfide exchange (FIG. 79) (Revell, K. D. et al. Bioorg. and Med. Chem, 2007, 15(6):2453-2467). In light of this, the semi-irreversible inhibition of FabH by CoA/alkyl mixed disulfides opens a new strategy for the blocking of this important enzyme. Although alkyl-CoA disulfides have been shown to bind tightly to purified FabH, treatment of S. aureus cultures with these disulfides does not inhibit bacterial growth, likely because the multicharged CoA cannot easily traverse the cell membrane (Clarke, K. M. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2005, 237:11234-11235). However, it was postulated that smaller, non-ionic disulfides might be able to function as CoA disulfide mimics: they could block the FabH active site via thiol transfer in the same manner as the CoA mixed disulfides, but their smaller size and greater lipophilicity make it easier for them to enter the cell and inhibit FabH. To evaluate this hypothesis, a set of simple disulfides was prepared, and their activities against several bacteria were tested. The design of CoA mixed-disulfide mimics was aided by previous research into FabH inhibitors. Jones et al. (Johns Hopkins University) reported that compound 30 (FIG. 8B) showed good activity against M. tuberculosis, presumably through inhibition of FabH (He, X. and Reynolds, K. A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 2002, 46(5):1310-1318). Kevin Reynolds (Portland State) reported compound 31 (FIG. 8C) inhibits E. coli FabH. Researchers at GlaxoSmithKline recently published data on a class of FabH inhibitors, including the crystal structure of S. aureus FabH (Daines, R. A. et al. J. Med. Chem., 2003, 46:5-8), and the co-crystal structure of compound 29 (FIG. 8A, where R═(CH2)4CO2H) in E. coli FabH (Qui, X. et al. Protein Science, 2005, 14:2087-2094). The crystal structures reported for compound 29 (Qui, X. et al. Protein Sci., 2005, 14:2087-2094) indicate that the active site is located within a fairly deep, lipophilic “pocket” into which acyl-CoA or acyl-ACP are able to stretch their lipophilic arm. Further, the co-crystal data reveals that, in the binding mode of compound 29, the 2,6-dichlorophenyl moiety reaches into the active site, such that the 4-position of the phenyl ring is proximal to the active site cysteine. Based on this, it was postulated that a molecule such as 32 (FIG. 9) might be able to effectively undergo thiol-disulfide exchange with the active site cysteine of FabH. The present inventors postulated that, unlike noncovalent inhibitors, CoA disulfide mimics would not require long residence times in the active site. Rather, they need only to be able to enter the site and transfer the thiol. With this goal in mind, and in light of the efficacy of the nonpolar compounds 30 and 31, it was postulated that small, somewhat lipophilic disulfides of the general type (FIG. 80) would be best suited to access the pocket. However, a deeper analysis suggests that compound 32 may be more specific than necessary. The effectiveness of benchmark compound 29 stems from its residence time in FabH. That is, its rate of binding to FabH is very fast, while its rate of dissociation is relatively slow. In the case of a CoA mixed disulfide mimic, however, such long residence times may not be needed. Rather, it is critical that the disulfides be small enough to fit easily into the active-site pocket to transfer the thiol to the cysteine. To test this hypothesis, a set of very simple aryl-alkyl disulfides (FIGS. 10 and 11) were prepared by semicombinatorial methods and analyzed for activity against S. aureus, B. anthracis, and Escherichia coli. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention concerns N-alkylthio β-lactams and disulfide compounds (e.g., aryl-alkyl disulfides), and methods for their use as anti-bacterial compounds. The N-alkylthio β-lactams do not function like the classical β-lactams nor show similar structure-activity relationships (SAR). An investigation of their mode-of-action is described herein. As shown in FIGS. 1A-B, N-alkylthio β-lactams (FIG. 1A) function as prodrugs to produce mixed CoA disulfides in the cell (FIG. 1B), which inhibit FabH by “capping” the active site cysteine (see Table 1). A crystal structure of E. coli FabH after treatment with CoASSMe shows that the SMe is covalently bound to the active site cysteine. Covalent FabH inhibition is not reversed by dialysis but is reversed by addition of dithiothreitol (DTT). These results suggest that N-alkylthio β-lactams can be used as anti-bacterial agents, such as anti-Staphylococcus aureus (e.g., methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)) agents and anti-Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) agents. The present invention also concerns the use of asymmetric disulfides comprising or consisting of coenzyme A on one side of the disulfide, and an alkyl chain on the other side of the disulfide, as treatments and preventatives for bacterial infection. It has been found that these molecules, which may be synthesized in the laboratory or produced within the bacterial cell through the action of a thiol-transfer agent such as the N-alkylthio β-lactam antibodies, act as potent antibacterial compounds effective against several genera, most notably Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., including MRSA, if produced or delivered intracellularly. These compounds function as potent inhibitors of type II fatty acid synthesis through the inhibition of a key condensing enzyme, FabH. This inhibition takes place through a mechanism involving a thiol-disulfide exchange to cap the active-site cysteine of FabH through formation of a disulfide. The present invention further includes the use of small aryl-alkyl disulfides, which act as molecular mimics of the asymmetric coenzyme A disulfides described above, and which also cap FabH through a thiol-disulfide exchange. Unlike the coenzyme A disulfides, these disulfides do not need to be produced inside the cell, or delivered to the interior of the cell, to be effective against Bacillus and Staphylococcus. A series of small aryl-alkyl disulfides was prepared and tested against methicillin-resistant Stapholococcus aureus (MRSA) and Bacillus anthracis. Several of these compounds inhibited MRSA at micromolar and B. anthracis at nanomolar concentrations. In one aspect, the present invention includes the N-alkylthio β-lactams and disulfide compounds (e.g., alkyl-coenzyme A asymmetric disulfides or aryl-alkyl disulfides) described herein, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which are useful as anti-bacterial agents. In another aspect, the present invention includes compositions comprising one or more N-alkylthio β-lactams and/or disulfide compounds (e.g., alkyl-coenzyme A asymmetric disulfides or aryl-alkyl disulfides), and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another aspect, the present invention includes methods for treating or preventing (e.g., delaying onset of) bacterial infection by administering an effective amount of an N-alkylthio β-lactam or disulfide compound (e.g., alkyl-coenzyme A asymmetric disulfides or aryl-alkyl disulfides) to a human or non-human patient in need thereof. Numbers in bold and/or in parenthesis refer to specific compounds described herein. The anti-bacterial compounds of the present invention act against several infective agents, and most notably Bacillus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., including MRSA.

FIG. 74 demonstrates that high levels of the free thiol CoA in the two species most vulnerable to N-alkylthio β-lactams (Staphylococcus, Bacillus) correlate with CoA's role within the thiol-redox buffer.

Mixed CoA disulfides (25a-f; FIG. 12) were prepared in good yields and high purity by treatment of free CoA (27) with stoichiometric amounts of the corresponding alkyl methanethiolsulfonates (Swerdlow, R. D. and Setlow, P. J. Bact., 1983, 153(1): 475-484). In order to obtain FabH, Professor Kevin Reynolds (Portland State University), who reported the purification of FabH from S. aureus was contacted (He, X. and Reynolds, K. A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 2002, 46(5):1310-1318). Serendipitously, Professor Reynolds had been developing FabH inhibitors for M. tuberculosis (Scarsdale, J. N. et al. J. Biol. Chem., 2001, 276(23):20516-20522; Li, Y. et al. J. Bacteriol., 2004, 187:3795-3799). The Reynolds group prepared and tested 25c against FabH isolated from E. coli and M. tuberculosis. Results from these tests are shown in Table 1. TABLE 1 IC50(μM) for Alkyl-CoA disulfides 25a, and 25c-f against FabH derived from E. coli (ecFabH) and M. tuberculosis (mtFabH) CoASSR R ecFabH mtFabH 25a methyl 57.07 ± 4.48 >300 25c s-butyl >300 >300 25d n-butyl >300 >300 25e n-octyl >300 23.2 ± 4.6 25f n-decyl >300 2.6 ± 1.6 The IC50 (concentration of inhibitor at which 50% inhibition of ecFabH is achieved) was determined by duplicate assays with a minimum of six concentrations of inhibitor. The IC50 values were calculated with Grafit 4.012 (Middlesex, United Kingdom). This data indicates that CoA disulfides can, in fact, inhibit FabH. However, it also suggests that the optimal size of the alkylthio piece for FabH inhibition is dependent on the strain of bacteria from which it comes. The FabH from E. coli is most susceptible to a small alkylthio fragment, while the M. tuberculosis FabH is more effectively inhibited by a long-chain variant. Based on the propensity of S. aureus to produce branched-chain fatty acids (Qui, X. et al. Protein Sci., 2005, 14:2087-2094), it is postulated that the branched alkyl chains may be optimal for inhibiting S. aureus FabH. This postulate is consistent with the observation that N-sec-butylthio β-lactams such as 2g are the most potent N-alkylthio analogs against both MSSA and MRSA (Turos, E. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 2002, 12:2229-2231). Reynolds also reported that the X-ray crystal structure of E. coli FabH which had been pretreated with 25a shows a methylthio group covalently bound to the active site cysteine (112Cys). These results provide convincing evidence that the mechanism of action proposed in the scheme of FIGS. 1A-B is correct, and suggests that this may be the key pathway through which the N-alkylthio β-lactams operate. The CoA disulfides (25a-c) were then tested for antibacterial activity against S. aureus. The alkyl methanethiolsulfonates (MTSs) (26a-c) used to produce the disulfides were also tested for anti-Staphylococcus activity. These tests (Table 2) show that, in every case, the CoA mixed disulfides were not active against S. aureus, but the corresponding MT Ss were. The efficacy of the MTSs supports the hypothesis that the intracellular production of mixed CoA disulfides is the source of biological activity. The apparent inactivity of the CoA mixed disulfides against bacteria does not detract from this hypothesis, since CoA analogs have been reported to have difficulty crossing the cell membrane (Clarke, K. M. et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2005, 237:11234-11235). These findings further suggest that the role of the N-alkylthio β-lactams may be to function as prodrugs to produce CoA mixed disulfides within the cytoplasm of susceptible bacteria. TABLE 2 Zones of growth inhibition (mm) for CoA-alkyl disulfides 25a-c and alkyl methanethiolsulfonates 26a-c against a methicillin-susceptible strain of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus ATCC 25923) and 10 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): Zones given represent partial growth inhibition. Compound S. aureus MRSA 25a 0 0 25b 0 0 25c 0 0 26a 22 23 26b 19 20 26c 23 23 In each case, 20 μg of the test compound in CH2Cl2 was applied to 6 mm cellulose disks prior to inoculation and incubation. The value corresponds to average diameter in mm (triplicate experiments) for the zone of growth inhibitions observed after 24 h of incubation at 37° C. S. aureus (ATCC 25923) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (labeled MRSA USF652-659 and USF919-920) were obtained from Lakeland Regional Medical Center, Lakeland, Fla. Errors values are within ±1 mm. In order to further explore the role of pathway (2), N-alkylthio β-lactams 2a and 2g were also tested against FabH. Surprisingly, both compounds exhibited inhibitory activity against purified E. coli FabH and M. tuberculosis FabH. Interestingly, the effect was much more pronounced for the FabH from E. coli (Table 3). It was also observed that the N-methylthio β-lactam was much more active than the sec-butylthio analog in both enzymes studied. TABLE 3 Percent inhibition of FabH derived from E. coli (ecFabH) and M. tuberculosis (mtFabH) by N-alkylthio β-lactams 2a and 2g.a Compound ecFabHb mtFabHc 2a 89 75 2g 30 4 aMeasured as the percent decrease in activity of FabH in the presence of test compounds, as compared to the same enzyme in the absence of test compounds. bMeasured using 1 μM of test compound. cMeasured using 10 μM of test compound. After measuring the inhibition of FabH by compounds 2a and 2g, the Reynolds group found that the activity of FabH was not regenerated by dialysis. However, activity of the FabH could be fully restored by treatment with dithiothreitol (DTT). This suggests that formation of the cysteine-alkyl disulfide is irreversible under buffered aqueous conditions, but that addition of a thiol, such as CoA or DTT, can reverse the effect through a thiol-disulfide exchange. Despite this positive evidence, preliminary microbiological studies conducted by the Reynolds group have suggested that the FabH pathway may not be the primary pathway through which N-alkylthio β-lactams inhibit bacterial growth. Among their findings: No significant formation of CoA mixed disulfides has been observed in cell extracts of Streptomyces coelicolor which have been treated with β-lactam.The inhibitory effects of the β-lactams on FabH are greatly diminished when S. coelicolor extracts are used instead of merely buffer. While these findings are noteworthy, it should be pointed out that S. coelicolor is reported to have mycothiol levels which are five times higher than the CoA levels.10a If the thiol-transfer hypothesis is correct, this high thiol level will greatly reduce the efficacy of the N-alkylthio β-lactams against S. coelicolor, and thus these results may not correlate with what will ultimately be observed in Bacillus or Staphylococcus. The activity of CoA mixed disulfides against purified FabH provides strong evidence that the N-alkylthio β-lactams function as prodrugs to produce mixed CoA disulfides within certain prokaryotic cells, and that these mixed disulfides inhibit the fatty acid cycle through inhibition of FabH. This mechanism is unique in that it involves a thiol-disulfide exchange from the mixed CoA disulfide to the active-site cysteine (FIGS. 1A-B). The capping may be considered to be semi-irreversible: because of the covalent nature of the cap, it cannot simply dissociate like a non-covalent inhibitor, but the cap can be removed and activity renewed through a thiol-disulfide exchange with an appropriate thiol. The mechanism proposed is supported by X-ray crystallographic studies. Understanding the ability of CoA mixed disulfides to covalently deactivate bacterial fatty acid synthesis represents a major advance in the quest for novel antibacterials. Due to the demonstrated inability of CoA mixed disulfides to traverse the cell membrane, these CoA disulfides are not directly useful as therapeutics. However, in accordance with the present invention, these compounds can be produced in vivo through the use of any thiol transfer agent, including but not limited to, beta-lactams, alkyl methanethiolsulfonates (which are commercially available), or aryl alkyl disulfides (wherein the aryl contains a withdrawing group). For example, this research shows that prodrugs such as the N-alkylthio β-lactams can be used to produce the CoA mixed disulfides within the bacterial target. Preliminary work done in the Reynolds laboratories has suggested that inhibition of FabH may not be the primary process by which the N-alkylthio β-lactams operate. However, if other mechanistic pathways exist, it is very possible that different CoA-dependent enzymes may also be inhibited. If this is the case, the profound new mode of action discovered in this study may be the first of many related strategies for the development of novel anti-infectives.

General Biological Methods. Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) and MRSA (ATCC 43300 and 33591) were purchased from ATCC sources. Eight additional strains of MRSA were obtained from Lakeland Regional Medical Center (Lakeland, Fla.). Bacillus bacteria (USF 848) from Sterne spore vaccine was purchased from Colorado Serum Co., Denver. Colo. Culture Preparation. From a freezer stock in tryptic soy broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) and 20% glycerol, a culture of each microorganism was transferred with a sterile Dacron swab to TRYPTICASE Soy Agar (TSA) plates (Becton-Dickinson Laboratories, Cockeysville, Md.), streaked for isolation, and incubated at 37° C. for 24 h. A 108 standardized cell count suspension was then made in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) and swabbed across fresh TSA plates. Antimicrobial Testing: Kirby-Bauer Method. Sterile saline (5 mL) was inoculated with a swab of bacteria, and then the concentration was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard. Bacterial solution was then streaked across a TSA plate to give an even lawn of bacteria. 1-30 μL sterile pipet tips were used to drill 6 mm wells into the agar plate, then 20 μL of 1 mg/mL drug in DMSO was added to the well. Plates were inoculated overnight at 37° C. Agar Dilution Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Assay. The antimicrobial and nanoparticle emulsion concentrations analyzed were determined by the standard NCCLS protocol M7-A2 (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Methods for Dilution of Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow Aerobically; NCCLS Document M7-A4, 1997, Vol. 17(2)), and these concentrations were pipeted into a pre-determined well of a 24 well plate. Muller Hinton agar was added to each well in liquid form to produce total well volumes of 1.5 mL. The contents of each well were thoroughly stirred to evenly distribute the antimicrobial solution within the agar. Once the agar solidified, 10 μL of sterile saline containing 0.5 McFarland Standard of the desired bacteria was pipeted on top of each agar and the plates were then incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. Bacterial growth was assessed by visual observation of growth. Measurement of 3H Acetate Uptake. The following experiments were carried out by Dr. Seyoung Jang. A culture of S. aureus (strain RN4220 in 1% Luria Broth) was used as 1% inoculum into fresh medium (20 mL) and cells were grown at 37° C. until the A600 reached 0.11 (1.3×107 cfu/mL). To a sample of culture was then added sufficient drug in DMSO such that the final concentration of DMSO in each sample was 2% by volume, and each sample contained one of the following: a.) Penicillin G, (2 ug/mL, 2×MIC); b.) Lactam 8 (10 μg/mL, 1×MIC); c.) Lactam 8 (20 μg/mL, 2×MIC); d.) no drug added. Each tube was incubated 5 min. at 37° C., and then 2 μl of 3H-acetate (10 μCi/uL in ethanol solution, sodium salt) were added to each tube (4 μCi/mL radioactivity per tube). At intervals of 15, 30, 45, and 60 min, 0.8 mL aliquots were taken from each tube, homogenized, and diluted with chloroform (1 mL) and methanol (2 mL). An additional 1 mL of chloroform was added, and the solution mixed. The organic solution was then washed with distilled water (1 mL), then 2M aq. KCl (3×1 mL), then 0.1 M aq. sodium acetate (3×1 mL). The radioactivity in the organic phase was then analyzed by scintillation counting. Enzyme Expression and Purification. The ecFabH and sgFabD protein was overexpressed in E. coli with N-terminal polyhistidine tag and subsequently purified by metal chelation chromatography as described previously (He, X. and Reynolds, K. A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 2002, 46(5):1310-1318; He, X. et al. Anal. Biochem., 2000, 282:107-114). FabH Enzyme Assay. FabH assays were carried out using a standard coupled trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay which determines the rate of formation of radiolabeled 3-ketoacyl ACP from malonyl ACP and radiolabeled acetyl CoA. In this coupled assay Streptomyces glauscescens FabD is used to generate the malonyl ACP substrate from malonyl CoA and Streptomyces glauscescens ACP (Lobo, S. et al. Biochemistry, 2001, 40:11955-11964). For inhibition studies, the test compounds were incubated with ecFabH for 15 min at room temperature (23° C.) prior to addition to a solution of [1-14C]acetyl-CoA and MACP. The IC50 (concentration of inhibitor at which 50% inhibition of ecFabH is achieved) was determined by duplicate assays with a minimum of six concentrations of inhibitor. The IC50 values were calculated with Grafit 4.012 (Middlesex, United Kingdom). Example 1 Synthesis of Aryl-Alkyl Disulfides In order to quickly synthesize a large number of aryl alkyl disulfides for screening, it was desirable to develop a preparation that was simple, easy to perform repeatedly, and which required minimal purification of the product disulfides. After testing a variety of conditions, it was found that this could be accomplished by combining a methanolic solution of thiol (100 μL of 1.0 M) with a slight excess of the alkyl methanethiolsulfonate (MTS) (105 μL of 1.0 M methanolic solution). After stirring under an inert atmosphere for 1 hr, the solutions were treated with a small amount (about 0.3 eq.) of cysteine hydrochloride, in order to consume the excess MTS. The solution was then concentrated in vacuo, taken up in dichloromethane (1 mL), filtered to remove any cysteine products, treated with Amberlyst-21 resin (weakly basic), then flushed through a small silica plug to remove impurities. In most instances, this yielded products >90% pure by 1H NMR. Following this general procedure (FIG. 10), disulfides were prepared by combining an array of thiols with various thiolating agents (FIGS. 11A-J).

Example 2 Activity Against Methicillin-Susceptible Staphylococcus aureus Antibacterial assays of disulfides 33-45 were performed on methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; ATCC 25923) by Kirby-Bauer well diffusion on agar plates according to NCCLS guidelines (National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards, Methods for Dilution of Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria that Grow Aerobically; NCCLS Document M7-A4, 1997, Vol. 17(2)). The zones of growth inhibition produced by the compounds against this microbe after 24 h of incubation at 37° C. are presented in Table 5. These results show that while the more lipophilic (33-35) disulfides are inactive, the p-nitrophenyl disulfides (38a-f) show extraordinary activity. Within the 2-pyridinyl disulfide series (42), the methyl (42a) and ethyl (42b) disulfides showed some activity.

Errors values are within ±1 mm. anumbers in parentheses represent areas of partial inhibition. Example 3 Synthesis of Second-Round Disulfides and Activity Against Methicillin-Susceptible S. aureus and Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus Based on the profound efficacy of disulfide set 38a-f, it seemed worthwhile to focus attention on the preparation of compounds which (a) contained the nitro group in other positions on the aryl ring, or (b) contained aryl substituents which mimicked the electron-withdrawing and/or hydrogen bond accepting nature of the para-nitrophenyl compounds. To this end, the meta-nitrophenyl disulfides (43a-f) and ortho-nitrophenyl disulfides (44a-f) were prepared by the general procedure described above (FIG. 14A). Additionally, disulfide 46a was prepared by the acetylation of 39a (FIG. 14B). The Kirby-Bauer data for these compounds are shown in Table 6.

Errors values are within ±1 mm. a. numbers in parentheses represent areas of partial inhibition. For compounds which showed activity in the Kirby-Bauer assays, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) were also determined, as shown in Table 7. The compounds were further tested by Kirby-Bauer assay against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). These results are shown in Table 8.

Compounds in the nitrophenyl disulfide series are, by far, the most potent antibacterial agents prepared to date in this laboratory, especially the meta and para series. The zones of inhibition of the isopropyl and sec-butyl compounds are substantially larger than the zones of the best N-alkylthio β-lactams developed previously in the Turos laboratories. Further, the zones of inhibition are considerably larger than many commercial antibiotics, including penicillin G and Ciprofloxacin (Table 9).

Analysis of the Kirby-Bauer and MIC data for the nitrophenyl disulfides shows that for both the para and meta substituted series, the isopropyl and sec-butyl disulfides perform the best against both MRSA and MSSA. With the ortho series, the methyl disulfide exhibits the greatest activity. It is not clear what causes this remarkable potency in the nitrophenyl disulfides. However, several postulates can be made: (1) The nitro group serves to enhance water solubility of the disulfides, allowing the molecules to move more freely into the cytosol. (2) The more lipophilic molecules (lacking the nitro moiety) are not able to stay in aqueous solution, or may remain sequestered in the cell membrane, thus reducing their availability to FabH. (3) The electron-withdrawing nitro groups make the disulfides more susceptible to attach by the cysteine thiolate. (4) The nitro substituent may be essential for the molecule to bind to the enzyme active site. In order to evaluate these possibilities, co-crystalization studies and in vitro studies with FabH are underway in the Reynolds laboratory. Additionally, several geometrically and electronically similar compounds, such as the sulfonates, phosphates, and carboxylates (47-54, FIGS. 16A-B) are being explored. Example 4 Activity Against Bacillus The activity of these disulfide compounds against Bacillus anthracis was also evaluated. Results of Kirby-Bauer and MIC studies are shown in Table 10 and Table 11, respectively. TABLE 10 Zones of growth inhibition (mm) of B. anthracis (USF 848) for aryl-alkyl disulfides. 38 42 43 44 46 a 47(54)a — 43 31 (23) b 56(67) (27) 32(40) 35 — c 71 (16) 30(54) 16(27) — d 56(62) (17) 27(41) 23 — e 49(57) — — — — f 44(52) — — — — In each case, 20 μg of the test compound in DMSO was added to wells prior to incubation.

The activity of these compounds against B. anthracis mimics that observed against S. aureus: the para and meta compounds outperform the ortho isomers, and the isopropyl and sec-butyl disulfides exhibit the greatest activity. The potency observed for these compounds is remarkable. The MIC values observed for 38c, 38d, 43c, and 43d are comparable to the reported value for Ciprofloxacin (0.094 for 50% growth inhibition) (Coker, P. R. et al. Antimicro. Agents Chemother., 2002, 46(12):3843-3845). Example 5 Activity Against E. coli None of the N-alkylthio β-lactams or N-alkylthio-2-oxazolidinones produced in the Turos group have ever shown any activity against E. coli. This has been postulated to be a result of the high glutathione levels relative to CoA in this species, so that the easily-reduced glutathione disulfides are formed in favor of CoA disulfides. However, since 33-46 were designed to act directly on FabH without interacting with CoA or glutathione, it was proposed that these compounds might exhibit activity against E. coli. Indeed, these compounds, particularly the p-nitrobenzene series (38a-f), do exhibit activity against E. coli (K12 strain, ATCC23590). This data is summarized in Table 12. The meta and ortho-nitrobenzene disulfides were also tested against E. coli, but showed less activity than the para isomers: compounds 43a and 44a showed a zone of inhibition of 10 mm and 9 mm, respectively. Compounds with alkyl groups larger than methyl showed no activity. TABLE 12 Kirby-Bauer zones of inhibition (mm) and minimum inhibitory concentration values (μg/mL) (MICs) for compounds 38a-f against E. coli (K12; ATCC 23590).

Numbers in parentheses represent zones of partial inhibition. It is interesting to note that the trends in activity observed for the nitrophenyl disulfides exactly parallel previous observations on the relative size of the active site in each of the strains studied. The active site of the E. coli FabH has been reported to react preferentially to acetyl CoA over larger or branched acyl CoA analogs (Heath, R. J. and Rock, C. O. J. Biol. Chem., 1996, 271(18):10996-11000). By contrast, the FabH from both Staphylococcus (He, X. and Reynolds, K. A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 2002, 46(5):1310-1318) and Bacillus (Choi, K-H. et al. J. Bacteriology, 2000, 182(2):365-370) have been reported to have larger active-site pockets, which favor reactions with branched acyl-CoA species such as isobutyryl-CoA (He, X. and Reynolds, K. A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 2002, 46(5):1310-1318). These trends are followed precisely in the bioactivities of the disulfide series, providing strong indirect evidence that these compounds do, in fact, inhibit FabH. This data is summarized in Table 13. TABLE 13 Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values (μg/mL) of the p-nitrophenyl disulfide series (38a-f) against S. aureus, B. anthracis, and E. coli. S. aureus B. anthracis E. coli Compound (ATCC 25923) (USF 848) (ATCC 23590) 38a 16 0.25 16 38b 32 0.25 16 38c 0.4 <0.125 96 38d 0.8 <0.125 128 38e 24 1 64 38f 32 1 96 MIC indicates the lowest concentration of drug (in μg/mL) where bacterial growth is visibly inhibited. The fact that the aryl-alkyl disulfides are less active against E. coli than against S. aureus or B. anthracis may be due to differences in the thiol-redox buffers (Argyrou, A. and Blanchard, J. S. Prog. Nucl. Acid Res. Mol. Biol., 2004, 78:89-142; Poole, L. B. et al. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxic., 2004, 44:325-347). Staphylococcus and Bacillus utilize a coenzyme-A based thiol-redox buffer, while E. coli uses a glutathione buffer. Coenzyme A disulfide reductase (CoADR) has been reported to be much more selective than glutathione disulfide reductase (GDR) (delCardayre, S. B. et al. J. Biol. Chem., 1998, 273(10):5744-5751). Thus, the active disulfides may be more easily reduced in E. coli. If so, this suggests that the aryl-alkyl disulfides will be less cytotoxic to eukaryotic cells, which also utilize a glutathione buffer. Example 6 Inhibition of Purified FabH Inhibition experiments on E. coli FabH verify that disulfides 38a-f are extremely active against this enzyme. Each compound in this series showed >90% inhibition of E. coli FabH at a disulfide concentration of 5 μM (Table 14). TABLE 14 Percent inhibitiona of FabH derived from E. coli by disulfides 38a-f. Compound ecFabH (%) 38a 94 38b 98 38c 98.5 38d 96 38e 91 38f 93 Measured as the percent decrease in activity of FabH in the presence of 5 μM of test compounds, as compared to the same enzyme in the absence of test compounds. The design of FabH inhibitors using the model of the CoA disulfides has been stunningly successful. From a relatively small set of very simple disulfides, several compounds with nanomolar activities against S. aureus and B. anthracis have been produced. These compounds exhibit potency which is comparable to that of several drugs currently on the market. The p- and m-nitrophenyl alkyl disulfides are the most potent disulfides synthesized thus far. Preliminary biological results suggest that these compounds may be “tuned” for optimal efficacy against a particular strain: For E. coli, the methyl disulfides are optimal. For Staphylococcus and Bacillus, the isopropyl- and s-butyl disulfides appear to be best. Based on the results described above, it is suspected that longer-chain disulfides may be optimal against M. tuberculosis. In light of the pressing need for new antibacterial compounds, particularly those effective against MRSA and B. anthracis (Garrett, L. The Coming Plague, Penguin Books: New York, 1994; Lowry, F. New Eng. J Med., 1998, 339:520-532), these simple disulfide compounds may represent a critical advance in the battle against infectious disease. It is therefore very important to continue the development of these compounds, and to more fully evaluate their potential as a new generation of commercial anti-infectives. The compounds of the present invention (also referred to herein as N-alkylthio β-lactams, alkyl-coenzyme A asymmetric disulfides, and aryl-alkyl disulfides) exhibit antibacterial activity against bacteria such as MRSA and anthrax. Because of their powerful antibacterial properties, the present compounds may also be used to supplement feed for animals. In addition, the compounds of the present invention that exhibit antibacterial activity may also be used as medicaments, and also as substances for preserving inorganic and organic materials, especially organic materials of all kinds, for example, polymers, lubricants, paints, fibers, leather, paper, timber, foodstuffs, and water. For example, these compounds can be covalently bonded to the polymer. The compounds of the present invention may also be used to prevent, alleviate, or cure diseases caused by pathogens whose growth is inhibited by these compounds. The instant compounds are particularly active against bacteria and bacteria-like microorganisms. They are therefore suitable for use in human and veterinary medicine, for the prophylaxis and chemotherapy of local and systemic infections caused by these pathogens. As used herein, the terms “treat”, “treating”, and “treatment” include therapy that alleviates one or more symptoms caused by the infection, or that cures the underlying infection. As used herein, the terms “prevent”, “preventing”, and “prevention” include prophylaxis, complete prevention, or delaying onset of the infection or delaying onset of one or more symptoms caused by the infection. Optionally, the method further comprises identifying the human or non-human subject as one suffering from a specific or non-specific bacterial infection. The presence of bacterial infection can be determined using methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art of clinical diagnosis of disease (e.g., infectious disease). The invention further encompasses methods for inhibiting the growth of bacteria by contacting the bacteria with an effective amount of the compounds of the invention in vitro or in vivo, or by applying the compound to a substrate (surface) likely to come in contact with the bacteria, such as a work surface, table, surgical instrument, implant or other device to be placed in or on the body (i.e., foreign object to be inserted into a subject, such as a stent, catheter, access port, intravenous delivery tube (Hickman), heart valve, dental implant, electro-mechanical device, prosthetic device, glucose sensor, or stabilizing device such as orthopedic nails and pins), eating or cooking utensil, etc. The compounds of the present invention include all hydrates and salts of the N-alkylthio β-lactams and disulfide compounds (e.g., alkyl-coenzyme A asymmetric disulfides or aryl-alkyl disulfides) that can be prepared by those of skill in the art. Under conditions where the compounds of the present invention are sufficiently basic or acidic to form stable nontoxic acid or base salts, administration of the compounds as salts may be appropriate. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids which form a physiological acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartarate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and alpha-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for example calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be made. The compounds of the present invention can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a patient, such as a human patient, in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, e.g., orally or parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical, or subcutaneous routes. Thus, the present compounds may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained. The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices. The active compound may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or its salts can be prepared in water or other suitable solvent, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form must be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with several of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient presenting the previously sterile-filtered solutions. For topical administration, the present compounds may be applied in pure-form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid. Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, alcohols or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the present compounds can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from adsorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers. Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user. Examples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the compounds of the invention to the skin are disclosed in Jacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478), Smith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508). Useful dosages of the compounds of the present invention can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art (U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949 (Borch et al.)). Accordingly, the invention includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention as described above; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Pharmaceutical compositions adapted for oral, topical or parenteral administration, comprising an amount of one or more compounds effective to treat a bacterial infection, are a preferred embodiment of the invention. The following definitions are used, unless otherwise described. Halo is fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo. “Alkyl,” “alkoxy,” etc. denote both straight and branched groups; but reference to an individual radical such as “propyl” embraces only the straight chain radical, a branched chain isomer such as “isopropyl” being specifically referred to. “Aryl” denotes a phenyl radical or an ortho-fused bicyclic carbocyclic radical having about nine to ten ring atoms in which at least one ring is aromatic. “Heteroaryl” encompasses a radical attached via a ring carbon of a monocyclic aromatic ring containing five or six ring atoms consisting of carbon and one to four heteroatoms each selected from the group consisting of non-peroxide oxygen, sulfur, and N(Rx) wherein Rx is absent or is hydrogen, oxo, alkyl, phenyl or benzyl, as well as a radical of an ortho-fused bicyclic heterocycle of about eight to ten ring atoms derived therefrom, particularly a benz-derivative or one derived by fusing a propylene, trimethylene, or tetramethylene diradical thereto. “Heteroalkyl” encompasses the replacement of a carbon atom within an alkyl chain with a heteroatom; e.g., replacement with an element other than carbon such as N, S, or O, including both an alkyl interrupted by a heteroatom as well as an alkyl substituted by a heteroatom. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that compounds of the invention having one or more chiral center(s) may exist in and be isolated in optically active and racemic forms. Some compounds may exhibit polymorphism.
