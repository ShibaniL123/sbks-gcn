Step 2
To Compound 156 (190 mg, 0.314 mmol) in ethanol (1.9 mL) and water (0.38 mL) solution were added iron powder (88.0 mg, 1.57 mmol) and sodium chloride (168 mg, 3.14 mmol), the mixture was stirred at 90Â°C for 2.5 hours. Water (30 mL) and ethyl acetate (50 mL) were added thereto, and the insoluble material was removed by filtration. The organic layer was washed with water (30 mL) and saturated brine (30 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration, the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 157 (108 mg, 60% yield) as brown foam.
