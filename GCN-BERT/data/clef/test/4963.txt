Baçk round of the Invention (I) Fìeld of the invention: The inventìon relates to musical instruments and, more particularly, to means for muting the sound of a drum. (2) Description of the Prior Art: While drum practice pads and practice drums have been well known they have not been entirely satisfactory because they adversely affect the drum sound as well as the bounce of the drum stick. Accordingly, while they have helped the practicing drummer in lowering the volume of the drum sound while enabling the drummer to practice drumming motions, nevertheless, all this was accomplished with a concomitant distortion and muffling of the drum soundçand a false or non-representative bounce of the drum stick. Moreover, while some practice drumsr, as for example, the one shown in U.S. Patent No. 3,105 406, have enabled the drummer to practice a rim shot, still the sound provided by such a practice drum was not satisfactory nor was the drum stick ilI bounce satisfactory. In addition, the practìce drum could only be used with particular sized drums. It could not be used with drums which had diameters smaller than its own. Summary The present invention eliminates the problems just referred to. The drum mute of the present invention can be used with any sized drum, does no% distort the drum sound but only lowers its volume, and the drum mute provides the same bounce of the drum stick as does the drum. More particularly, the drum mute is constructed with legs that rest on the surface of the drum whereby the bottom of the drum mute is above the surface of the drum to form an open space. This open space presents obstruction of the drum sound while at the same time reducing its volume without distorting it. Moreover, the drum mute includes a rim which has mounted in its bottom a drum pad | ì Comprised of a pair of Stacked disks which are so constructed i, to ç k • i< /. il • i?!i. ï• .... i i•i i' i•ii !ii) • ..'i'/¸'. . ? ii i ,,ï . il " í cause the drum stick no bounce to the same extent as it does when similarly struck against the drum surface. The drummer in every respect during practice duplicates the exact motion and sound as during regular playing, except that the volume of the sound is reduced to a point where it is not disturbing to those in the immediate vicinity of the drummer. Moreover the loudness of the sound is easily adjusted. Brief Description of the Drawig@s FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the drum mute of the present invention in operative position on the surface of a drum; FIG. 2 is a top plan view of the drum mute. FIG. 3 is a'bottom plan view of the drum mute. FIG. 4 is a vertical section, with portions cut away, taken on line 4-4 of FIG. 2, but on a larger scale; and FIG. 5 is a vertical partial section, taken on line 5-5 of FIG. 4. Description of the Preferred Embodiment' Referring now to the drawings in detail, the drum mute i0 of the present invention comprises a metal cylindrical rim 12 which resembles the rim of a drum. The upper hall 14 of the rim is channel-shaped and the lower hall 16 extends straight downwardly therefrom and is of slightly larger diameter, as best seen in FIG. 4, to provide a seat 18 for a circular drum pad 20 which forms the bottom of the drum mu'te. Pad 20 comprises an upper resilient disk 22 of sponge rubber secured along its bottom surface by a suitable adhesive to the top surface of a lower substantially rigid disk 24 of compressed cardboard. Preferably, the thickness of the spong rubber is about 1/8" and the thickness of the compressed cardboard about 3/8". It should be noted that disk 22 is not foam rubber which was discovered to have insufficient body. A suitable compressed cardboard was discovered to be one available under the trademark "Homosote". The sponge rubber may be white or black and is covered with a thin circular sheet 26 of clear or cloduy plastic material, such as the material known under the trademark "Mylar", which is suitably secured by adhesive to the upper surface of disk 22. The bottom surface of disk 24 may be covered by a circular sheet 28 of paper secured by adhesive fo it. Spaced around the circumference of rim 12 are struckout I l0 portions 30 which provide means for securing a series of channelshaped tracks 32 to the rim. A pair of tracks are shown in FIG. 3 but it will be understood that additional tracks can be provided. l I The tracks extend across the bottom of pad 20. A fastening bolt 34 exteñds through each end of the track and through struck-out portion of the rim. Nuts•36 secure each'bolt to the rim. A pair of legs'38 is slidably mounted in each channel of a track. Each leg comprises a bolt 40 covered by a resìlient material 42. The bolt is screwed in a shòe 44 that is movable along the track. The leg is locked into position by rotating the screw up against the track. This locks the shoe An the channel of the ç track. In this manner, the position of the legs can be easily adJusted to accommodate various sizes of drums. It is to be noted that the legs extend downwardly from the pad and rest on the drum surface so that the bottom of the pad is lb ...? " " i ::; x. ï .?i.,. ; « "" x spaced above the drum surface to form an open space 46 (FIGS. 1 and 4) i: This Öpen space does not hinder the flow of sound so that there are • ï no obstructions which would distort the sound. The sound is exactly • the same as would be produced by the drum stick directly striking the surface of the drum but it is lower in volume. The structure of the pad has been found to reproduce the bounce of the drum stick as if the stick had actually struck the drum surface instead of the pad. For different sized drums, the legs are adjustable for proper posii itioning of the drum müte on the drum surface. Accordingly, the drum diameter can be larger or smaller than the diameter of the drum mute and the drum mute can still be used with such a drum. The volume of the sound can be raised or lowered by shortening or lent gthening the legs. The upper portion 14 of the rim enables the drummer to i -i practice rim shots and the overall appearance of the drum mute closely resembles the appearance of the top of a drum thereby further providing the drummer with a close resemblance to actual drumming ,on a snare drum or tom tom while only practicing. While the invention has been described and illustrated in connection with a snare drum or tom tom, it will be understood that the inventìon is also applicable to base drums to which the drum mute can be readily attached as, for example by suction cups an the ends of legs 38. • •" ,. ,i ' ç ï , • ç The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: I.
