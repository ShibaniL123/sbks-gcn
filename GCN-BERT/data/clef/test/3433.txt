Example 54A
Methyl 4-{[(6-bromo-3-fluoro-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}-3-fluorobenzoate
At RT, 159 mg (0.87 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate, 247 mg (0.65 mmol) of HATU and 112 mg (0.87 mmol) of DIPEA were added to a solution of 150 mg (0.43 mmol) of the compound from Example 12A in 4 ml of DMF, and the mixture was then stirred at 60Â° C. for 1 h. After cooling to RT, the mixture was added to 20 ml of a 10% strength citric acid solution. The resulting precipitate was then filtered off, washed with water and dried under reduced pressure. This gave 222 mg (97% of theory, purity 97%) of the title compound
