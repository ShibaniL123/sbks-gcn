Step 3
The compound 30 (150 mg, 0.416 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (1 mL). Tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride (1 mol/L tetrahydrofuran solution, 831 ÂµL, 0.831 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 day. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica-gel column chromatography (chloroform-methanol) to give the compound 31 (92 mg, yield 84.9%).
