Example 6
Preparation of 2-chloro-5-((1R,3R)-2,2-dichloro-3-(4-fluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)-N-(2,4-difluoro-3-(4-fluorobenzamido)phenyl)benzamide (F1204)
2,4,6-Tripropyl-1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxatriphosphinane 2,4,6-trioxide (T3P®, 50% solution in ethyl acetate; 0.213 g, 0.335 mmol) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of N-(3-amino-2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-chloro-5-((1R,3R)-2,2-dichloro-3-(4-fluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamide (DP9) (0.100 g, 0.168 mmol), 4-fluorobenzoic acid (0.028 g, 0.201 mmol), and pyridine (0.040 g, 0.503 mmol) in anhydrous ethyl acetate (3 mL). The solution was stirred for 12 hours at 50° C. and concentrated. Purification by silica gel flash chromatography gave the title compound as a white foam (0.029 g, 23%).
