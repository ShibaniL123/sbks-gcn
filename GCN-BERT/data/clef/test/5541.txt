BACKGROUND Mitochondria are intracellular organelles responsible for a number of metabolic transformations and regulatory functions. They produce much of the ATP employed by eukaryotic cells. They are also the major source of free radicals and reactive oxygen species that cause oxidative stress. Consequently, mitochondrial defects are damaging, particularly to neural and muscle tissues which have high energy level demands. Thus, energetic defects have been implicated in forms of movement disorders, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, blindness, and deafness (DiMauro et al. (2001) Am. J. Med. Genet. 106, 18-26; Leonard et al. (2000) Lancet. 355, 299-304). There are a number of mitochondrial diseases resulting from both nuclear and mitochondrial genetic defects, and the underlying biochemistries of these diseases tend to be rather similar. They include increased lactate production, diminished respiration and ATP production, and reflect the consequences of oxidative stress.

In addition, the compounds of the invention can be used for prophylaxis of redox stress and enhancement of cellular function. Friedreich's Ataxia Friedreich's ataxia is a severe neurodegenerative and cardiodegenerative condition. It is characterized by progressive ataxia of the limbs, muscle weakness, dysarthria, skeletal deformities and cardiomyopathy. While the biochemical basis of the disease is still under investigation, it is strongly associated with insufficient frataxin (Wilson et al. (1997) Nat. Genet. 16, 352-357; Wilson et al. (2003) J. Neurol. Sci. 207, 103-105). In the majority of patients the insufficiency of frataxin is a consequence of an intronic GAA triplet repeat expansion in the gene for frataxin, which results in a significant decrease in its mRNA levels, and ultimately in protein levels as well (Campuzano et al. (1996) Science 271, 1423-1427; Campuzano et al. (1997) Hum. Mol. Genet. 6, 1771-1780). Frataxin acts as an iron chaperone during heme biosynthesis (Bencze et al. (2007) J. C. S. Chem. Commun. 1798-1800) and has been shown to be capable of stimulating the in vitro assembly of heme and Fe—S clusters (Park et al. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 31340-31351; Yoon et al. (2003) J. Am Chem. Soc. 125, 6078-6084; Yoon et al. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 25943-25946). Frataxin can interact physically with mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins, as well as with mitochondrial aconitase (which contains an Fe—S cluster) (Bulteau et al. (2004) Science 305, 242-245; Gonzalez-Cabo et al. (2005) Hum. Mol. Genet. 14, 2091-2098). Therefore, frataxin deficiency results in disruption of cellular iron homeostasis, with a progressive iron accumulation in the mitochondrion, and a deficiency in heme and Fe—S clusters. It is believed that a deficiency in frataxin leads to compromised mitochondrial respiratory chain function through a failure to assemble one or more Fe-utilizing proteins; one or more Fe—S clusters in the mitochondrial respiratory complexes are likely to represent a critical locus. In fact, diminished function of these complexes has been noted in Friedreich's ataxia patients (Bradley et al. (2000) Hum. Mol. Genet. 9, 275-282). The loss of mitochondrial respiratory chain function can lead to diminished ATP production, while the accumulation of Fe in the mitochondria makes the organelle highly susceptible to oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species, whose concentration increases concomitant with the decrease in respiratory chain function. There is compelling evidence that while oxidative damage is not the primary lesion in Friedreich's ataxia, oxidative stress helps to drive disease progression. Therefore, strategies to overcome oxidative stress should blunt disease progression and provide effective therapy. Other Exemplary Mitochondrial Diseases Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is associated with degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and causes progressive loss of vision resulting in various degrees of blindness. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy primarily affects men over the age of 20 and is maternally transmitted due to mutations in the mitochondrial (not nuclear) genome. Kearns-Sayre syndrome is a rare neuromuscular disorder typically with onset usually before the age of 20. It is characterized by progressive external ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of the eye muscles) and mild skeletal muscle weakness, hearing loss, loss of coordination, heart problems, and cognitive delays. There are many other names for the Kearns-Sayre syndrome including: Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia CPEO with myopathy; CPEO with ragged-red fibers; KSS; Mitochondrial cytopathy, Kearns-Sayre type; Oculocraniosomatic syndrome; Ophthalmoplegia-plus syndrome; Ophthalmoplegia with myopathy; and Ophthalmoplegia with ragged-red fibers. Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy with Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-Like Episodes is a progressive mitochondrial disease that involves multiple organ systems including the central nervous system, cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle, and gastrointestinal system. Symptoms include muscle weakness, stroke-like events, eye muscle paralysis, and cognitive impairment. Leigh syndrome is a degenerative brain disorder is usually diagnosed at a young age (e.g. before age two). Deterioration is often rapid with symptoms such as seizures, dementia, feeding and speech difficulties, respiratory dysfunction, heart problems, and muscle weakness. Prognosis is poor with death typically occurring within a few years of diagnosis. Mitochondrial Energy Production Energy released from the citric acid (Krebs) cycle in the mitochondrial matrix enters the mitochondrial electron transport chain as NADH (complex I) and FADH2 (complex II). These are the first two of five protein complexes involved in ATP production, all of which are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Electrons derived from NADH (by oxidation with a NADH-specific dehydrogenase) and FADH2 (by oxidation with succinate dehydrogenase) travel down the respiratory chain, releasing their energy in discrete steps by driving the active transport of protons from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space (i.e., through the inner mitochondrial membrane). The electron carriers in the respiratory chain include flavins, protein-bound iron-sulfur centers, quinones, cytochromes and copper. There are two molecules that transfer electrons between complexes: coenzyme Q (complex I→III, and complex II→III) and cytochrome c (complex III→IV). The final electron acceptor in the respiratory chain is O2, which is converted to H2O in complex IV. In a functional mitochondrion, transport of two electrons through complex I results in the transport of 4 H+ into the intermembrane space. Two more H+ transfers to the intermembrane space result from electron transport through complex III, and four more H+ transfers from electron transport through complex IV. The 10 electrons transported to the intermembrane space create a proton electrochemical gradient; they can return to the mitochondrial matrix via complex V (ATP synthase), with the concomitant conversion of ADP to ATP. It is interesting that no H+ is transferred to the intermembrane space as a consequence of electron transport through complex II. Therefore, 2e− transfer from FADH2 (complex II→complex III→complex IV) results in the transport of only 6 protons, compared with 10 protons resulting from 2e− transfer from NADH (complex I→complex III→complex IV), with correspondingly less ATP produced. Each glucose molecule metabolized by glycolysis produces 12 electrons; these are converted to 5 NADH molecules and 1 FADH2 via the Krebs cycle in the mitochondrial matrix. The 5 NADH molecules employed in mitochondrial electron transport produce about 25 ATPs, while the single FADH2 affords only about 3 ATP molecules. (There are another 4 molecules of ATP derived from glucose metabolism—2 during glycolysis and 2 in the Krebs cycle). While this analysis underscores the importance of complex I involvement in normal ATP production, it also tends to obscure certain metabolic realities/uncertainties that may offer important opportunities for therapeutic intervention. One metabolic reality is that complex I, while important quantitatively for ATP production in normal mitochondria, is not essential for all mitochondrial ATP production. Electrons can enter the electron transport chain at the level of coenzyme Q (either from complex II or from fatty acid oxidation), producing about 60% as much ATP as would have resulted had they entered the electron transport chain at complex I). While the flux of electrons that normally enter the individual mitochondrial complexes, ultimately passing through coenzyme Q, is probably dictated largely by the availability of electrons derived from NADH, FADH2 and fatty acid oxidation, the actual intrinsic capacity of the individual pathways does not appear to have been studied carefully. In functional mitochondria, a few experimental parameters can be measured readily, reflecting mitochondrial respiration. These include NADH and O2 consumption, and ATP production. Less readily measured are the electrons that flow through the electron transport chain, thereby consuming oxygen, and producing H2O and ATP. The electrons within the mitochondria can really only be measured when they are associated with one of the mitochondrial electron carriers such as coenzyme Q. In humans, this mitochondrial coenzyme is present as coenzyme Q10, which has a 50-carbon C-substituent that renders the molecule virtually insoluble in water (calculated octanol-water partition coefficient >1020) (James et al. (2005) J Biol. Chem. 280, 21295-21312). In dysfunctional mitochondria, one can still carry out the same types of measurements as noted above for functioning mitochondria. If the flow of electrons through complex I is interrupted, several measured parameters should change. These include diminished consumption of NADH (measured as increased lactate through pyruvate reduction) and diminished ATP production. Since electrons will not flow as efficiently from complex I to coenzyme Q, the concentration of this reduced coenzyme will diminish. Interestingly, a new pathway for oxygen consumption is created. While oxygen is not converted as efficiently to water in complex IV (an overall four electron reduction of each oxygen molecule), much of the flow of electrons into a defective complex I is redirected to oxygen, with the production of superoxide (a one electron reduction of each oxygen). Thus, the stoichiometry of oxygen utilization is altered. The production of superoxide by mitochondria actually occurs to some extent even in normal mitochondria, but is a much more frequent event in mitochondria containing defects in the respiratory chain. Superoxide is one form of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Superoxide itself is not believed to react readily with biological molecules such lipid membranes, proteins and DNA, and actually functions as a signaling molecule for the regulation of certain cellular processes. Biologically, the main fate of superoxide (O−.2) is a disproportionation reaction with itself to produce peroxide (H2O2) and oxygen, i.e. [in-line-formulae]2O−.2+2H+→H2O2+O2 [/in-line-formulae] This reaction occurs spontaneously, and can also be catalyzed by superoxide dismutase. Superoxide can also be reduced to peroxide in a monovalent process. Like superoxide, hydrogen peroxide is also not intrinsically deleterious to cellular macromolecules, and is actually essential to the function of a number of enzymes. However, in the presence of metal ions such as iron and copper, hydrogen peroxide is converted to hydroxyl radical (HO.) and hydroxide ion (OFF) according to the Fenton reaction, i.e. [in-line-formulae]HOOH+Fe2+→Fe3++HO.+OH−[/in-line-formulae] Hydroxyl radicals are very highly reactive, capable of reacting with virtually any biological molecule, including DNA, proteins and lipids. Hydroxyl radicals can also diffuse through cells readily, and their ability to damage cells is limited only by the distance that they travel before they react. Hydroxyl radicals can also react with superoxide, producing singlet oxygen ((1O2)+OH−), another highly reactive form of ROS that damages cellular macromolecules and assemblies. One particularly deleterious and well-studied reaction mediated by hydroxyl radicals is the abstraction of hydrogen atoms (H.) from membrane lipids, forming a carbon-centered radical (R.). This radical [in-line-formulae]HO.+RH(lipid)→R.+H2O[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]R.+O2→ROO.[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]ROO.+RH→ROOH+R.[/in-line-formulae] can readily react with oxygen, forming a hydroperoxy radical (ROO.). The hydroperoxy radical is also highly reactive, and can abstract another hydrogen atom from the membrane lipid, producing another carbon-centered radical (which can undergo precisely the same chemistry), ultimately producing a chain reaction affording many oxidative lesions in the membrane lipids from a single hydroxyl radical (lipid peroxidation). It is for this reason that lipid peroxidation likely represents a major process by which cellular and mitochondrial membranes are degraded in cells containing (partially) dysfunctional mitochondria. The observed accumulation of lipofuscin in Friedreich's ataxia patients is fully consistent with the thesis that lipid peroxidation is a central process that drives disease progression (La Marche et al. (1980) Can. J. Neurosci. 7, 389-396; Yin, D. (1996) Free Rad. Biol. Med. 21, 871-888; Yamada et al. (2001) J. Lipid Res. 42, 1187-1196). It may be noted that while all lesions in the mitochondrial electron transport chain that affect mitochondrial dysfunction will result in elevated levels of superoxide, some types of lesions may be expected to produce more functional damage. The latter would certainly include Friedreich's ataxia, in which suboptimal levels of the protein frataxin (which is responsible for cellular iron homeostasis; Park et al. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 31340-31351; Yoon et al. (2003) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 125, 6078-6084; Yoon et al. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 25943-25946; Bencze et al. (2007) J. C. S. Chem. Commun. 1798-1800) and assembly of FeS clusters in proteins results in an accumulation of Fe2+/3+ within the mitochondria, and contributes instead to the Fenton chemistry noted above. Likewise, disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are associated with a deficiency in the detoxifying enzyme superoxide dismutase, and will have greatly enhanced concentrations of the ROS discussed above. One poorly studied parameter of mitochondrial electron transport is whether the process is best characterized as involving one or two electron transfers. The is important because NADH is an obligatory two-electron donor, and coenzyme Q and cytochrome c participate in two-electron redox cycles, as does FADH2. Virtually all publications represent the processes in which these species participate as involving a net two electron change. However, FADH2 may (and generally does) transfer its reducing equivalents as single electrons. Further, the Q cycle in complex III clearly involves single-electron transfers. Reduced cytochrome c is known to transfer electrons one at a time to cytochrome c oxidase, the enzyme responsible for the final step in respiration. Finally, the accumulation of electrons within dysfunctional mitochondria (producing reductive stress) is relieved substantially by (one-electron) reduction of oxygen to superoxide (vide supra). Thus, while the electron transport chain has the capacity to transfer two electrons by virtue of the redox cycles of most of its participants, it is not clear that it necessarily must do so to function. Given that the reductive stress (build-up of electrons) encountered initially in mitochondrial dysfunction is a one electron process, as is lipid peroxidation, carriers of single electrons could find utility in dealing with reductive stress, e.g. molecules in which the one-electron reduced intermediate is stabilized by dipole interactions, substituent effects, resonance effects or captodative effects. Molecules designed to traffic single electrons, and which can (i) accept electrons from superoxide (ii) donate electrons to complex III and (iii) quench carbon-centered lipid radicals are especially useful. Multifunctional Radical Quenchers (MRQs) of the invention can effectively protect mitochondria, cells and organisms from oxidative stress.

By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated and/or eradication or amelioration of one or more of the symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that the patient reports an improvement in feeling or condition, notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. Therapeutic benefit also generally includes halting or slowing the progression of the disease, regardless of whether improvement is realized. The amount of compound(s) administered will depend upon a variety of factors, including, for example, the particular indication being treated, the mode of administration, whether the desired benefit is prophylactic or therapeutic, the severity of the indication being treated and the age and weight of the patient, the bioavailability of the particular compound(s) the conversation rate and efficiency into active drug compound under the selected route of administration, etc. Determination of an effective dosage of compound(s) for a particular use and mode of administration is well within the capabilities of those skilled in the art. Effective dosages may be estimated initially from in vitro activity and metabolism assays. For example, an initial dosage of compound for use in animals may be formulated to achieve a circulating blood or serum concentration of the metabolite active compound that is at or above an IC50 of the particular compound as measured in as in vitro assay. Calculating dosages to achieve such circulating blood or serum concentrations taking into account the bioavailability of the particular compound via the desired route of administration is well within the capabilities of skilled artisans. Initial dosages of compound can also be estimated from in vivo data, such as animal models. Animal models useful for testing the efficacy of the active metabolites to treat or prevent the various diseases described above are well-known in the art Animal models suitable for testing the bioavailability and/or metabolism of compounds into active metabolites are also well-known. Ordinarily skilled artisans can routinely adapt such information to determine dosages of particular compounds suitable for human administration. Dosage amounts will typically be in the range of from about 0.0001 mg/kg/day, 0.001 mg/kg/day or 0.01 mg/kg/day to about 100 mg/kg/day, but may be higher or lower, depending upon, among other factors, the activity of the active metabolite compound, the bioavailability of the compound, its metabolism kinetics and other pharmacokinetic properties, the mode of administration and various other factors, discussed above. Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the compound(s) and/or active metabolite compound(s) which are sufficient to maintain therapeutic or prophylactic effect. For example, the compounds may be administered once per week, several times per week (e.g., every other day), once per day or multiple times per day, depending upon, among other things, the mode of administration, the specific indication being treated and the judgment of the prescribing physician. In cases of local administration or selective uptake, such as local topical administration, the effective local concentration of compound(s) and/or active metabolite compound(s) may not be related to plasma concentration. Skilled artisans will be able to optimize effective local dosages without undue experimentation. DEFINITIONS The following terms and expressions used herein have the indicated meanings.

Lipid Peroxidation Assay Cis-Parinaric Acid Oxidation to Measure Lipid Peroxidation Several methods for assaying lipid peroxidation in vitro have been developed (Kuypers et al. (1987) Biochim Biophys Acta. 25, 266-274; Pap et al. (1999) FEBS Lett 453, 278-282; Drummen et al. (2002) Free Radic Biol Med. 33, 473-490). Almost all of these methods are based on inhibition of free radical-induced oxidation reactions. A widely used fluorescence assay for lipid peroxidation uses lipid soluble cis-parinaric acid as a probe. cis-parinaric acid loses its fluorescence (λexc/em: 320/432 nm) upon interaction with peroxyl radicals and retains its fluorescence in the presence of radical quenchers. cis-parinaric acid is, however, air sensitive, photolabile and absorbs light in the UV region of the spectrum (at ˜320 nm). However, this region of the spectrum is where most compounds have also been found to absorb and emit light. In practical terms, the results obtained using cis-parinaric as a probe for lipid peroxidationare confounded due to the overlapping of the compounds emission spectra with the cis-parinaric emission spectrum. C11-BODIPY581/591 Oxidation to Measure Lipid Peroxidation To overcome the problem of spectral overlap using cis-parinaric acid, a fluorescence assay for lipid peroxidation using a lipophilic probe belonging to the BODIPY class of fluorescent dyes was used. C11-BODIPY581/591 (4,4-difluoro-5(4-phenyl-1,3-butadienyl)-4-bora-3a, 4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-propionic acid) fluorescence shifts from red to green upon oxidation. C11-BODIPY581/591 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg., USA) stock solution concentrations were determined by measuring the absorption of C11-BODIPY581/591 at 582 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 140,000 mol−1 cm−1 (R. P. Haugland, (1999) Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals, Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, Oreg.). The lipid peroxidation inducer 2,2′-Azobis (2-amidino-propane dihydrochloride) (AAPH) and the antioxidant compound α-tocopherol were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo., USA). Phospholipid bilayers were prepared from 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (SOPC) and 1,2-dilinoleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC) and were purchased from Avanti® polar lipids, INC (Alabaster, Ala., USA). Preparation of Liposomes Phosphotidylcholine (PC) liposomes were prepared as described before (Guey-Shuang et al. (1982) Lipids. 17, 403-413). Briefly, DLPC (25 mg) and SOPC (25 mg) were dissolved in chloroform and the solvent was removed by nitrogen evaporation (˜2 hours to give a thin film of PC in a round bottom flask. The lipid film was hydrated with 50 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM KCl, shaken and sonicated for 15 seconds. The liposomes obtained were filtered several times through 0.2 μM membrane filter. Measurement of C11-BODIPY581/591 Oxidation C11 BODIPY581/591 was incorporated into liposomes and oxidized by peroxyl radicals derived from the decomposition of AAPH in presence and absence of the compounds. Liposomes (1 mg/mL), suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM KCl, were transferred to a quartz 1 mL cuvette and placed in a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorometer (Varian, Cary, N.C.) equipped with a thermostatted cuvette holder at 40 C.°. Liposomes were pre-incubated for 10 min with 200 nM C11 BODIPY581/591 to allow their incorporation into the lipid phase of the liposomes. After the addition of AAPH (10 mM) the decay of red fluorescence was followed at λexc=570 nm, λem=600 nm. Relative fluorescence units were normalized to 100% intensity. Results obtained were verified by repeating experiments N=3 independent experiments. Measurement of C11-BODIPY581/591 Oxidation in Cell Culture Lipid peroxidation in cells was detected by utilizing the oxidant-sensitive lipophilic probe C11 BODIPY581/591. Briefly, cells (5×105 cell/mL) were treated with the test compounds at final concentrations of 1 and 2.5 μM, and incubated at 37° C. for 4 or 24 h in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air. Cells were treated with 500 nM C11 BODIPY581/591 in phenol red-free RPMI-1640 media and incubated at 37° C. in the dark for 30 minutes. The cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline and oxidative stress was induced with 5 mM DEM in phenol red-free RPMI-1640 media for 90 minutes. Treated cells were collected by centrifugation at 300×g for 3 minutes and then washed twice with phosphate buffered saline. Cells were re-suspended in 250 μL of phosphate buffered saline and were analyzed by FACS (FACS Calibur flow cytometer, Becton Dickinson) to monitor the change in intensity of the C11 BODIPY581/591 green (oxidized) fluorescence signal. Assay for Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Species (TBARS) Lipid peroxidation by hydrogen peroxide in bovine heart mitochondrial membranes was determined by measuring the amount of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances released. Bovine heart mitochondria (1 mg protein) prepared as described by Smith (38) were added to 800 μL of 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and subjected to oxidative stress by the addition of 25 mM glucose and 1 U/mL glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger. Samples were incubated with or without test compounds at 37° C. for 30 minutes. Two hundred μL each of 1% (w/v) thiobarbituric acid and 35% (v/v) perchloric acid, as well as 0.1% (w/v) butylated hydroxytoluene (from a 2% stock solution in DMSO) were added. Samples were heated at 100° C. for 15 minutes. One-mL aliquots of each sample were taken and diluted in 2 mL of water, then extracted once with 2 mL of n-butanol. Triplicate 500-μL aliquots were taken from the butanol phase and transferred to a quartz cuvette. TBARS were determined fluorometrically from the emission spectrum (λex 515 nm; λem 550 nm) using a Varian fluorimeter. The malondialdehyde concentration was determined based on a standard curve created using serial dilutions of 10 mM 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane hydrolyzed in 1% (v/v) H2SO4 at 4° C. overnight. The malondialdehyde concentration was expressed as nmoles manoldialdehyde per mg protein. Protein in aliquots of the homogenates was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method. II. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Assay Cellular ROS production can be monitored using 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) (LeBel et al. (1992) Chem. Res. Toxicol. 5, 227-231) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg., USA), a membrane permeable and oxidant-sensitive fluorescent dye. DCFH-DA is a non-fluorescent derivative of fluorescein that emits fluorescence after being oxidized by hydrogen peroxide and other ROS. The emitted fluorescence is directly proportional to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide. DCFH-DA is nonionic and nonpolar and is easily taken up by cells. Once inside the cell, DCFH-DA is hydrolyzed by cellular esterases to non-fluorescent DCFH which traps the dye in the cell. In the presence of ROS including hydrogen peroxide, DCFH is oxidized to the highly fluorescent compound dichlorofluorescein (DCF). The intracellular DCF fluorescence is used as an index of cellular ROS production. Cellular oxidative stress was induced by pharmacological depletion of glutathione (GSH) using the chemical diethylmaleate (DEM). Cells (1×106 cell/mL) were plated (1 mL) in twelve well plate and treated with the invention compounds (final concentration 1, 2.5, 5 or 10 μM), and incubated for fifteen hours at 37° C., 5% CO2. The compounds tested were prepared by first making stock solutions (1 mM) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Cells were treated with 5 mM DEM for 30 minutes and collected by centrifugation at 300×g for 3 min and then washed twice with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) (Invitrogen, N.Y., USA). Cells were re-suspended in PBS buffer+10 mM glucose and incubated at 37° C. in the dark for 20 min with 10 μM DCFH-DA. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 300×g for 3 min and then washed twice with PBS buffer. The samples were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry (Becton-Dickinson FACS Caliber), (Cell Quest software, BD Biosciences) using 488 nm excitation laser and FL1-H channel 538 nm emission filter. In each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded after cell debris were electronically gated out. Results obtained were verified by running duplicates and repeating experiments N=3 independent experiments. Authentic hydrogen peroxide was used as a positive control. III. Superoxide (O2−.) Assay Cellular Superoxide production can be monitored using Dihydroethidium (DHE), a fluorogenic probe that is highly selective for Superoxide among ROS (Bindokas V P, J Neurosci 16: 1324-1336, 1996) (Invitrogen, USA). The emitted fluorescence is directly proportional to the concentration of superoxide radical. It is cell-permeable and reacts with superoxide anion to form ethidium, which in turn intercalates in the deoxyribonucleic acid, thereby exhibiting a red fluorescence (Hwan H Y, Oncology Reports 21: 253-261, 2009). Cellular Superoxide generation was induced by pharmacological inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport between cytochrome b and c, using Antimycin A (Alexander A. Biochim Biophys Acta 767:120-129, 1984) (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells (1×106 cell/mL) were plated (1 mL) in twenty four well plate and treated with the invention compounds (final concentration 1, 2.5, 5 or 10 μM), and incubated for fifteen hours at 37° C., 5% CO2. The compounds tested were prepared by first making stock solutions (1 mM) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Cells were treated with 50 μM Antimycin A for two hours and then, with 60 μM DHE. The samples were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry (Becton-Dickinson FACS Caliber), (Cell Quest software, BD Biosciences) using 488 nm excitation laser and FL2-H channel 585 nm emission filter. In each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded after cell debris were electronically gated out. Results obtained were verified by running duplicates and repeating experiments N=3 independent experiments. Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin Chloride (MnTBAP) (Sigma-Aldrich, Mo., USA) was used as a positive control. IV. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψm) Assay Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψm)(FACS). For the determination of Δψm, cells were pre-treated with or without the test compounds. The cells were treated with 5 mM DEM for 120 minutes, collected by centrifugation at 300×g for 3 minutes and then washed twice with phosphate buffered saline. The cells were re-suspended in PBS buffer and incubated at 37° C. in the dark for 15 minutes with 250 nM TMRM (a cationic dye which accumulates within mitochondria in accordance with the ΔψmNernst potential). Cells were collected by centrifugation at 300×g for 3 minutes and then washed twice with phosphate buffered saline. The samples were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry using 488 nm excitation laser and the FL2-H channel. The results obtained were verified in three independent experiments. The protonophore FCCP (30 μM) was used to dissipate the chemiosmotic proton gradient (ΔμH+) and served as a control for loss of Δψm. In each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded. V. Trypan Blue Cell Viability Assay Cell viability determined by trypan blue exclusion assay: This technique was used to assess the cytoprotective effects of the invention compounds in cultured cells pharmacologically treated to induce cell death by GSH depletion. DEM was used to deplete cellular GSH and induce oxidative stress. The viability of DEM-treated cells was determined by their ability to exclude the dye trypan blue. Viable cells exclude trypan blue; whereas, non-viable cells take up the dye and stain blue. Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 1×106 cells/mL and treated with different concentrations of the invention compounds. Cells were incubated at 37° C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air for three hours with 5 mM DEM. Cell viability was determined by staining cells with 0.4% trypan blue using a hemocytometer. At least 500 cells were counted for each experimental group. At the time of assay, >95% of DEM-treated cells were trypan blue positive; whereas, in non-DEM treated control cell cultures >95% cells were viable. Cell viability was expressed as the percentage of control. Data are expressed as means±S.E.M (n=3). VI. Cell Viability Assays (FACS) Cell viability and cytotoxicity were determined by simultaneous staining live and dead cells using a two-color fluorescence assay, the Live/Dead® Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (Molecular Probes). This assay is used to measure two recognized parameters of cell viability, intracellular esterase activity and plasma integrity. The membrane-impermeant DNA dye ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) was used to identify dead cells whose plasma membrane integrity was disrupted. The membrane-permeant dye calcein-AM was used to label live cells. It penetrates into the cells where it is metabolized by cytoplasmic esterases and becomes a fluorescent but membrane-impermeant probe which is retained in viable cells. Cells were incubated overnight in RPMI medium (control) and in the presence of test compound and then treated with DEM for 3 to 6 hours. Cells were stained with 0.2 μM calcein-AM and 0.4 μM EthD-1. After 15 minutes, flow cytometry analysis was carried out using excitation at 488 nm. The green-fluorescent (539 nm) FL1-H channel, live-cell population appears in the lower right quadrant and the red-fluorescent (585 nm) FL2-H channel dead-cell population appears in the upper left quadrant. In each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded. Results obtained were verified in three independent experiments. VII. Calcein-AM Cell Viability Assay A cell viability assay using the dye calcein acetoxymethyl (AM) was used to determine the effects of invention compounds on GSH-mediated cell death in primary FRDA patient derived fibroblasts (Jauslin et al. (2002) Human Molecular Genetics. 11, 3055-3063) FRDA fibroblasts were treated with L-buthionine (S, R)-sulfoximine (BSO) to inhibit de novo synthesis of GSH (Griffith et al. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 7558-7560) causing oxidative stress, plasma membrane damage and cell death. Fibroblasts from Friedreich Ataxia patients, but not control cells, die after GSH depletion on incubation with BSO (Jauslin et al. (2002) Human Molecular Genetics. 11, 3055-3063). Cell viability was determined using calcein-AM (Molecular Probe, Eugene, Oreg.). In live cells, non-fluorescent calcein AM is hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases to produce the strongly green fluorescent anion calcein. BSO (L-buthionine (S, R)-sulfoximine) and (+)-alpha-tocopherol were purchased from Sigma Chemicals and calcein AM was purchased from Molecular Probes. Cell were grown in 75 cm2 culture flasks (T75) and incubated at 37° C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Cells were fed twice a week and split every third day at a ratio of 1:3 upon reaching confluency. The invention compounds and reduced and oxidized forms of idebenone and alpha-tocopherol were reconstituted in DMSO or ethanol to provide 2.5 mM stock solutions. The compounds were screened according to the previous protocol (Jauslin et al. (2002) Human Molecular Genetics. 11, 3055-3063): Fibroblasts were seeded in 96 well microtiter black-walled cell culture plates (Costar, Corning, N.Y., USA) at a density of 3000 cells per well (100 μL). The plates were incubated overnight at 37° C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air to allow attachment of the cells to the culture plate. Serial dilutions of intervention and references compounds were made from their respective stock solutions to give a total volume of 150 μL in each well. Plates were incubated overnight in cell culture. The following day, 50 μL of a 4 mM BSO solution (in culture media) was added to each well to provide a final BSO concentration of 1 mM. Cell viability was assessed after first signs of toxicity appeared in BSO-treated cells (typically after 24-30 hours) by examining cultures under phase-contrast microscopy. The cell culture medium was discarded by aspiration and each well of the cell culture plate washed with pre-warmed HSSB to remove serum esterase activity. Cells were then treated in with 200 μL of 1.2 μM calcein-AM in HSSB for 60 min at 37° C. in the dark to allow the dye to enter the cell and be cleaved by esterases. The negative control/background was 200 μL of HSSB buffer. Fluorescence intensities were measured with a Spectramax M5 spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA) using excitation and emission of 485 nm and 525 nm respectively. The intervention compounds were assayed in triplicate. The solvent vehicles used either DMSO or ethanol did not affect cell viability at the concentrations (0.5-1%) used in the assay. The viability of non-BSO treated fibroblasts was set as 100%, and the viability of the BSO-treated and sample-treated cells was calculated relative to this value. Cell viability was expressed as the percentage of control. Data are expressed as means±S.E.M (n=3). VIII. Cytochrome c Reduction Assay The rate of cytochrome c (10 μM) reduction was measured by monitoring the change in absorbance at 550 nm. Briefly the reaction was initiated by addition of 100 μM of the invention compounds to a mixture containing 50 mM phosphate buffer, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.8, and 10 μM cytochrome c (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo. USA). For cytochrome c reduction by superoxide, xanthine oxidase (0.01 IU/mL) (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo. USA) was used in presence of xanthine (50 μM). IX. Total Intercellular ATP Concentration Assay The reductions of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity in CoQ10 deficient patients have been reported (Quinzii G M, Lopez L C, Von-Moltke J, Naini A, Krishna S, Schuelke M, Salviati L, Navas P, DiMauro S, and Hirano, M. Respiratory chain dysfunction and oxidative stress correlate with severity of primary CoQ10 deficiency. FASEB J. 2008; 22:1874-1885). The use of CoQ10 analogues to normalize and restore the respiratory chain activities could provide valuable therapeutic approach. We have evaluated the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation in CoQ10 deficient lymphocyte (GM17932) in presence of tested CoQ10 analogues by measuring total cellular ATP content using (ViaLight® Plus ATP monitoring reagent kit, Lonza). Briefly, lymphocytes (2×105 cell/mL), were plated (1 mL in 12-well plates) and treated with the test compounds at final concentrations of 5, 10 μM, and 25 μM and incubated at 37° C. for 48 h in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air. The test compounds were prepared by first making 20 mM stock solutions in DMSO. Cells were transferred (100 μL) to 96-well microtiter black-walled cell culture plates (Costar, Corning, N.Y.). The total intracellular ATP level was measured in a luminator (Clarity™ luminescence microplate reader) with the ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit (ViaLight® Plus ATP monitoring reagent kit, Lonza) following the manufacturer's instructions. The standard curve of ATP was obtained by serial dilution of 1 mM ATP solution. After calibration against the ATP standard, the ATP content of the cell extract was determined and normalized for protein content in the cell. FIG. 1 shows that the cellular content of ATP are significantly lower in CoQ10 deficient than normal lymphocyte. X. NADH Oxidase Inhibition Assay Beef heart mitochondria were obtained by a large-scale procedure. Inverted submitochondrial particles (SMP) were prepared by the method of Matsuno-Yagi and Hatefi (J. Biol. Chem. 260 (1985), p. 14424), and stored in a buffer containing 0.25 M sucrose and 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) at −80° C. Inhibitory effects of compounds on bovine heart mitochondrial complex (I, III, IV) were evaluated. Maximal dimethyl sulfoxide concentration never exceeded 2% and had no influence on the control enzymatic activity. Beef heart SMP were diluted to 0.5 mg/mL. The enzymatic activities were assayed at 30° C. and monitored spectrophotometrically with a Beckman Coulter DU-530 (340 nm, ε=6.22 mM−1cm−1). NADH oxidase activity was determined in a reaction medium (2.5 mL) containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 5 mM MgCl2. The final mitochondrial protein concentration was 30 μg/mL. After the pre-equilibration of SMP with inhibitor for 5 min, the initial rates were calculated from the linear portion of the traces. XI. Mitochondrial Bioenergetics Assessment The use of CoQ10 analogues and methylene blue analogues to normalize and restore the respiratory chain activities provides valuable therapeutic approach for mitochondrial diseases. The reductions of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity in Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) patients have been reported. The efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation was evaluated in FRDA lymphocyte (GM15850) in presence of tested CoQ10 analogues and methylene blue analogues by measuring total cellular ATP content using (ViaLight®-Plus ATP monitoring reagent kit, Lonza). FRDA lymphocyte cell lines were obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories. FRDA lymphocytes were cultured under glucose-free media supplemented with galactose for two weeks to force energy production predominantly through oxidative phosphorylation rather than glycolysis. Lymphocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium glucose-free supplemented with 25 mM galactose, 2 mM glutamine and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 10%, dialyzed fetal bovine serum FBS (<0.5 μg/mL). Briefly, lymphocytes (2×105 cell/mL), were plated (1 mL in 12-well plates) and treated with the test compounds at final concentrations of 50,125.250,1000, and 5000 nM, and incubated at 37° C. for 48 h in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in air. Cells were transferred (100 μL) to 96-well microtiter black-walled cell culture plates. The total intracellular ATP level was measured in a luminator (Clarity™ luminescence microplate reader) with the ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit (ViaLight®-Plus ATP monitoring reagent kit, Lonza) following the manufacturer's instructions. Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluormethoxy-phenylhydrazone (FCCP) and oligomycin were used as control for inhibition of ATP synthesis.
