Step 5: [5-(d3)methylpyrimidin-2-yl]methanol
To a solution of (d3)methyl 5-(d3)methylpyrimidine-2-carboxylate [Example 10, Step 4] (700 mg, 4.43 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in methanol (25 mL) was added NaBH4 (505.1 mg, 13.3 mmol, 3.00 equiv) at 0° C. The resulting solution was stirred for 3 h at 25° C. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of H2O (10 mL). The resulting mixture was concentrated under vacuum to remove MeOH. The resulting solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (3×10 mL). The organic layers were dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum to afford 500 mg (88.9%) of [5-(d3)methylpyrimidin-2-yl]methanol as a yellow solid.
