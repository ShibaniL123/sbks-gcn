BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates generally to sport/utility caps or hats, also generally known as skull caps, for covering the head of the wearer during outdoor sports, work, or other outdoor activities. 2. Related Art Skull caps are small, close-fitting caps or hats without a brim, which cover part of the head including at least the crown and part of the side of the head, rear of the head, and forehead, and are often used by indoor and outdoor activity enthusiasts such as runners, hikers, swimmers, triathletes, cyclists, kayakers, surfers, and the like. One problem with such caps is that they sometimes do not fit well and may become loose or uncomfortable, or even fall off during activity. Such caps often do not sufficiently protect the head from harmful effects of the sun when outdoors. FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate a prior art skull or sport/utility cap 10 made of Lycra®, which is an elastic polyurethane fabric. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the cap 10 has an upper head covering part 12 which is generally dome shaped, and a lower peripheral rim or band 14 which is of uniform height around the entire periphery of the cap. As illustrated in FIG. 2, the cap when worn covers an upper part of the wearer's ears 19. SUMMARY In one aspect, a sport/utility or skull cap or hat is made of an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) rated elasticated fabric which is both wickable and breathable, so that it has the ability to wick moisture or sweat from the head of the wearer in addition to protecting the wearer's head covered by the cap from the sun. The cap is designed to provide cool, wickable and breathable headwear which fits closely and comfortably on the wearer's head. This reduces sweat and increases radiative cooling. The cap is designed to provide sun protection to the head area when a wearer is outdoors, and has an edge trim or band around the lower periphery which is of varying height, having wider or taller side portions to provide full or substantially full coverage for the ears, and may have more coverage at the nape of the neck. The fabric may be partially or completely made of recycled materials In one embodiment, the elasticated fabric is made at least partially from recycled material, and is UPF rated to 50+ for both A and B type UV rays. In one embodiment, the fabric material is formed from a composition of polyamide and elastane, fabricated or treated to provide UVA and UVA blocking properties. The polyamide may be a recycled material, and in one embodiment the cap material includes around 65% recycled material. Other features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art after reviewing the following detailed description and accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Certain embodiments as disclosed herein provide for a sport/utility cap or brimless hat designed to provide outdoor protection to the head, and made of an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) rated elasticated fabric which is both wickable and breathable, and which is designed to fit closely over the wearer's head. In one embodiment, the cap has predetermined dimensions designed to provide more coverage for the ears and the nape of the neck of a wearer than the prior art sport/utility caps or skull caps. After reading this description it will become apparent to one skilled in the art how to implement the invention in various alternative embodiments and alternative applications. However, although various embodiments of the present invention will be described herein, it is understood that these embodiments are presented by way of example only, and not limitation. As noted above, the prior art skull cap or brimless, head fitting hat 10 of FIGS. 1 and 2 has a lower peripheral rim or band 14 of uniform height. The cap is formed by sewn pieces of Lycra® fabric, with the upper part 12 formed by four generally triangular fabric pieces 15 sewn together along seams 16 which meet at the apex 17 or crown of the cap. The lower rim or band 14 is sewn to the lower edge of upper part 12 along seam 18. The band 14 is of uniform height around the entire periphery of the cap. The dimensions of prior art cap 10 are as follows: Total height of hat (A)=20 cm. (7.9 inches).Height of lower rim or band (B)=5 cm. (2 inches).Diameter at lower edge (C)=24 cm. (9.4 inches).Width at lower end of triangle formed by seams (D)=12 cm. (4.7 inches).Height from seam 18 to apex 17 (E)=15 cm. (5.9 inches). As illustrated in FIG. 2, edge trim 14 of cap 10 when worn covers the upper part of the wearer's ears 19, but leaves the majority of the ears exposed. FIGS. 3 to 7 illustrate one embodiment of an improved sport/utility cap or brimless hat 20 which has a generally dome-shaped upper portion 22 and a lower rim or band 24 of varying height. Sport/utility or skull cap 20 is made of an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) rated elasticated fabric which is both wickable and breathable, so that it has the ability to wick moisture from the head of the wearer in addition to protecting the wearer's head covered by the cap from the sun, while the breathability keeps the head cool. Lower band 24 around the lower periphery of cap 20 is of varying height, having wider or taller side portions 25 to provide full coverage for the ears, and narrower front and rear portions 26, as can be seen in FIG. 7 and as described in more detail below. The band may also be designed to provide more coverage at the nape of the neck than prior art cap 10. In one embodiment, the elasticated fabric is UPF rated to 50+ for both A and B type UV rays, and may be a composition of polyamide and elastane. In one example, the composition was 65% polyamide and 35% elastane, where the elastane provides compression characteristics to help the cap to stay tight on the wearer's head. In one embodiment, the fabric is made from woven fibers of polyamide/elastane composition, with the fiber structure, density of weave, or other characteristics designed such that the material is wickable and breathable, and has an ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) of 50 or more. The polyamide may be made of recycled material, so that the cap is at least 65% recycled material. In one embodiment, the fabric had a weight of 285 g/m2 and was elastic or stretchable in both directions. Stretch to dynamometer was 70% width and 75% length. Resistance to pilling was 4%. This fabric has been certified and tested by Standards Australia (AS/NZS) to the standard AS/NZS 43399:1996 and has also been tested to the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 for textile products, and adheres to international guidelines for ultraviolet protection factors (UPF) with a rating of 50+. In one embodiment, the fabric used to make the cap was J1 RENEW PRIME, manufactured by Jersey Lomellina SpA of Carvico, Italy. In one embodiment, the upper portion 22 of the cap 10 is made from four generally triangular pieces 27 of the elasticated fabric, sewn together along adjacent seams 28 meeting at the crown or apex 30 of the cap. The lower band may be formed from a double layer of the elasticated fabric material, i.e. an elongated strip folded in half lengthwise or two superimposed strips of the material secured together along a lower seam located inside the cap and not visible in the drawings. Opposite ends of the lower band 24 are sewn together at seam 33 (see rear view of cap in FIG. 5) to form a circle of predetermined circumference to fit closely around the head when positioned as in FIG. 7, and the band is then sewn to the lower edge of the upper, dome-shaped portion along seam 32. In one embodiment, flat lock and overstitch sewing methods were used on a flatlock, cover stitch and bar tack machine to form all seams, so as to provide comfort and enhanced compression in the cap. In one embodiment, all joining seams 28, 32, 33 are of flat-seam construction so as to minimize chafing and increase comfort. All logos and user instructions are applied using heat transfer rather than embroidery which could cause chafing, which also helps to make the cap more comfortable to wear. In one embodiment, the logo is applied using heat transfer on the outer layer of band 24 to ensure that the inside layer of the band contacting the head is completely smooth. In one embodiment, the dimensions of various parts of a one-size adult cap or hat 20 as marked on FIG. 4 in the non-stretched state may be in the following ranges: A=Total height at widest part of band=Around 7.5 inches to around 8.0 inches.B=Height of lower band at widest part 25=Around 2.25 inches to around 2.50 inches.C=Height of lower band at narrowest part 26=Around 1.75 inches to around 2.00 inches.D=Width of triangle=Around 4.75 inches to around 5.00 inches.E=Height of triangle or seam 16=Around 5.25 inches to around 5.50 inches.F=Total height at center front (narrowest part of band)=Around 6.75 inches to around 7.25 inches.G=Total circumference of cap at band seam 32=Around 19 inches to around 20 inches. In one specific example, the non-stretched cap dimensions were as follows: A (total height)=Around 7.5 inches.B (widest part of band)=Around 2.25 inches.C (narrowest part of band)=Around 1.75 inches.D (width of triangle)=Around 4.75 inches.E (height of triangle)=Around 5.25 inches.F (total height at center front)=Around 7 inches.G (total cap circumference at band seam 32)=Around 19 inches. The above dimensions are for a one size, adult cap or hat. Dimensions D and E are selected so that the dome shaped part 22 of the cap above the band is slightly smaller than dome shaped part 12 of the prior art cap of FIGS. 1 and 2, and fits more closely to the average adult head then part 12 of the prior cap, without being too tight. This reduces or minimizes rucking up of the cap to produce a more streamlined appearance than the slightly larger dome part of the prior art cap. The band is positioned around the head as indicated in FIG. 7 to cover most or all of the wearer's ears. However, the cap or hat may also be provided in different sizes, for example scaled down for a child and in different adult sizes such as a scaled up adult large size for wearers with larger heads. The following dimension ranges are suitable for a child size cap: A (total height)=Around 7.0 to 7.5 inches.B (widest part of band)=Around 2.25 inches.C (narrowest part of band)=Around 1.75 inches.D (width of triangle)=Around 4.5 inches.E (height of triangle)=Around 4.75 to 5.25 inches.F (total height at center front)=Around 6.5 to 7.0 inches.G (total cap circumference at band seam 32)=Around 18 inches. The main difference in dimensions for a child size hat is circumference at the band. The band itself has around the same height at the widest and narrowest part as the adult cap or hat, and covers the ears in exactly the same way as the adult hat when worn. A large or extra-large size adult hat or cap may have the following dimensions: A (total height)=Around 8.0 to 8.5 inches.B (widest part of band)=Around 2.25 inches.C (narrowest part of band)=Around 1.75 inches.D (width of triangle)=Around 5 inches.E (height of triangle)=Around 5.75 to 6.25 inches.F (total height at center front)=Around 7.5 to 8.0 inches.G (total cap circumference at band seam 32)=Around 20 inches. FIG. 7 illustrates cap or hat 20 worn on the head 34 of a user. As illustrated, the widest or tallest portions 25 of the lower band 24 are located on opposite sides of the hat and are designed to cover most or all of the wearer's ears, unlike the prior art cap 10 shown worn in FIG. 2 with most of the ear 19 exposed. Thus, the ears are protected from the sun in this embodiment by double layer of certified UVF 50+ protection provided by the fabric from which the cap is made. This is an advantage, since it is difficult to adequately protect the ears from the damaging UVA and UVB radiation of the sun using sunscreen alone. The fabric area may also be stretched or increased in dimensions to cover more of the upper neck area than the prior art cap, which is another region typically susceptible to sun damage. The cap or hat described above in connection with FIGS. 3 to 7 is designed for anyone to wear when outdoors to protect the head and ears from sun damage. Regardless of the amount of hair, the scalp is still susceptible to sun damage when exposed to the sun over significant periods of time. The cap may be worn during any outdoor activities including running, walking, cycling, swimming, surfing, working, and the like. The cap may be particularly helpful in providing outdoor protection for sun sensitive skin on the heads of individuals who are bald as a result of hair loss due to aging, shaving the head, or illness. The material and construction is designed both to provide certified UVF 50+ protection and also to create a cool, comfortable, wickable, and breathable product. The material allows the heat produced by the head to be wicked away, reducing sweat and increasing radiation cooling to the head and body, creating a much more comfortable and sustainable workout. The shape and dimensions of the band are arranged so that the wearer's ears are substantially or completely covered by the larger height band portions, further increasing comfort and sun protection. The above description of the disclosed embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the invention. Various modifications to these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles described herein can be applied to other embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention.
