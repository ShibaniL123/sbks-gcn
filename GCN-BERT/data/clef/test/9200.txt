Synthesis Example 5
Synthesis of Compound 139
1.91 g (1.59 mmol, yield=45%) of Compound 139 was synthesized in the same manner as in Synthesis Example 1, except that 3.52 g (7.08 mmol) of 12-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)chrysene-6-carbaldehyde was used instead of 1.64 g (7.08 mmol) of 4-phenyl-1-naphthaldehyde, and Intermediate 4-hydroxy-3-(12-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)chrysen-6-yl)pent-3-en-2-one was used instead of Intermediate 4-hydroxy-3-(4-phenylnaphthalen-1-yl)pent-3-en-2-one.
