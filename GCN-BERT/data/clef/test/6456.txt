-25 73 97 My invention relates to an improvement in lubricating means for shafts, and has particular relation to the lubrication of gyratory crushers in which an actuating eccentric sleeve surrounds the gyrated shaft of the crusher. One purpose is to provide a lubricating systern effective under heavy duty, as with crushers which are required to crush highly refractory materials. Other purposes »rill appear from time to time in the course of the specification and claims. I illustrate the invention more or less diagrammatically in the accompanying drawings, wherein: Figure ! is a vertical axial section and Figure 2 is a section on an enlarged scale on the line 2--2 of Figure I. Like parts are indicated by like symbols ............... ç " ....... . ° , "!/ throughout the specification and draftings. Referring to the drawings, i generally indicates any suitable base or support which is provided with a cavity 2 into which part of the crusher may extend. 3 generally indicates a circt aferential outer frame element of a gyratory cone crusher, it is shown as having a top circumferential flange 4 out»rardly extending and having a bottom spring abutment 5. A bow! supporting ring 6 is normally held fixed in relation to the frame 3, for example, by a plurality of tension members 7» a circumferentia! abutment ring 8 and a plurality of springs 9. The ,f. i!:!:i :: -351 7 97 ring 6 is shown as being inwardly screw threaded as at I0 to receive an outwardly threaded bowl II. Suitably mounted on a plate support is a bowl liner 12. 13 is a fixed, a d generally cylindrical sleeve which may be secured to or formed integrally with the circumferential frame member 3. For exszapie, the two parts may be secured together by a plurality of generally radially extending ribs or spider arms 14. The sleeve 13 is outwardly enlarged as at 15 and supports a y suitable upwardly concave, generally spherical bearing element or elements 16. 17 is a head having a do»mqwardly convex bearing portion 18 resting upon the support or bearing 16. The head 17 is mounted on a crusher shaft generally indicated as 20, the shaft having a downwardly tapered lower portion or extension 21. 22 is an eccentrically apertured sleeve rotatable within the fixed bearing sleeve 13. 23 is any suitable bearing liner. 24 is a gear secured to the sleeve 22 for uaitary movement therewith. It may be rotated by the pinion 25 on the driving shaft 26 which is driven from any suitable power source, not herein shown. It »Till be understood that in response to tlhe rotation of the shaft 26, the sleeve 22 is rotated. This inner, eccentric bearing aperture receives the shaft portion 21, 22a being any suitable bearing liner. The result of the rotation of the eccentric sleeve 22 is to impart a gyratory wobble to the head 17 «about Ai!¸ ii ii ¸ i0 1 73 97 the center X. The head carries any suitable crushing mantle 28 opposed to the crushing liner 12. The space between the numbers 28 and 12 constitutes the crushing space into which the material to be crushed is admitted from above. It may, for exampled be directed to and into the top of the crushing cavity by any suitable hopper or deflector 29 It OEII be understood that the details of the crusher do not of themselves form part of the present invention. In gyratory crushers in which an eccentrically apertured sleeve is used to gyrate a crushing shaft» the lubricating problem is difficult of solution. The present invention is directed to a lubricating system which provides highly efficient lubrication even though opposed crushing members are subjected to great crushing stress» as in the crushing of unusually hard materials. indicates a lubricant supply pipe extending from any suitable pump» not herein shown. In communication with it is a broach pipe 31 which extends to the fixed bearing sleeve 13» as at 32, at a point generally midway between the top and the bottom of the sleeve 13. In line wíth the area of delivery at 32 is an aperture or hole 33 in the bearing liner 23. This in turn is in line with a circumferential duct depression 34 formed about the exterior surface of the eccentrically apertured sleeve 22. Corm unicating with this circumferential duct or channel 34 is ii i: i¸ Y:Y iii!- Y w 1 73 the generally radial duct or passage 35 extending inwardly through the thin side of the eccentric sleeve 22. It is in interior communication with the longitudinally extending channel 34a formed in the inner wall of the eccentric sleeve 22. This in turn extends upwardly to the irmer circumferential channel 3L b formed in the inner surface of the bearing liner or sleeve 22a. Extending radially inwardly through the shaft 21 is the passage 36 which is in communication with the circumferential channel 34b at its outer end a d th the axial oil passage 37 of the shaft portion 21» at its inner end. Passage 37 serves as an oil delivery duct for lubricating he head bearing. The oil return passage 38 and its branch 39 return oil to the oil return pipe 40 and» ultimately to the main oil return pipe 41. It will be realized that whereas I have described and claimed a practical and operative device» nevertheless» many changes may be made in size» shape» number and disposition of parts wíthout departing from the spirit of my invention. I therefore wish my description and draçrings to be taken as in a broad sense illustrative and diagrammatic rather than as limiting me to my specific showing herein. 71::!;: i: i i !iiii!i i0 51 73 The use and operation of my invention are as follows: In a gyratory cone crusher of the type above described, I deliver lubricating oil to the eccentrically apertured sleeve 22 intermediate its upper and lower ends and, therefore, intermediate the upper and loç er ends of the gyrated shaft which gyrates the head to deliver the crushing compression against the material in the crushing cavity. The eccentric sleeve 22 has an exterior annular groove 34 which connects with the hole 35 and the vertical groove 34a° A relatively small-sized hole 36 conveys oil from the circumferential groove 34b for lubrication of the inner socket liner 16 upon which the head 17 rests. As will be clear from Figure i» the duct 37 is closed at its lower end as at 37a. With the above described arrangement, the oil enters at the center of the outer and inner bushings or liners and flows both upwardly and downwardly with increased volume and pressuT'e. I find it advantageous to circulate oil at a substantially increased volume and pressure. In my structure, I may double or more than double the rate of flow» stated iu gallons per minute, in any particular size of crusher» without increasing the bearing clearance. The increased oil pressure tends to maintain the oil film despite high loadings on the bearings. Z í i::::,..:: E frill ii A « It » ii be understood that the actual piping or duct projections, exterior to the shaft and eccentric» may be varied and do not of themselves form part of the present invention. It will be understood, however, that the extension A of Figure i may be employed to provide oil for the countershaft 26, the details of the connection not being shown, since they do not form part o£ the present invention. i!:!::y • i: i: i :i 1 73 The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: i.
