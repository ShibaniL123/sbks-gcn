Preparation of (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2-ethoxyphenyl)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
Sodium nitrite (0.039 g, 0.56 mmol) as a solution in water (0.750 mL) was added dropwise to a cooled solution of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2-ethoxyphenyl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (0.240 g, 0.54 mmol) in propionic acid (3.0 mL) at −15° C., and the reaction was maintained under these conditions for 1 hour. Then ice-cold EtOAc (10 mL) was added, followed by saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (15 mL) in portions. Once addition was complete and gas evolution ceased, the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (×2), and the combined aqueous layers were extracted with EtOAc (×2). The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash chromatography, elution gradient 20 to 60% ethyl acetate in hexanes, to afford (6S,8R)-6-(4-bromo-2-ethoxyphenyl)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (0.145 g, 59%) as a gum.
