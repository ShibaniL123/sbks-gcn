Technical Field The present invention relates, generally, to orthodontic treatment, and in particular to a system and method for modeling and application of interproximal reduction of teeth to facilitate orthodontic treatment. Background of the Invention One problem experienced during orthodontic treatment is the residual crowding of adjacent teeth due to insufficient interproximal reduction (IPR). The ability to resolve the crowding of teeth to create sufficient space and IPR during treatment is an important issue in the growing field of computational orthodontics. To create such spacing, stripping and/or other trimming processes are most often utilized, but the determination of such stripping and trimming can be very difficult. Document US 2006/0068355 A1 for instance discloses a computerized system and method for IPR teeth modelling of a patient to facilitate orthodontic treatment. For example, clinicians generally do not know in what particular region or area to strip a particular tooth if the stripping is needed. Clinicians generally do not know where the stripping region is located as current quantifying collision functions only output a collision amount. Such processes for determining a stripping region are reactive in nature, rather predicative. Such limitations often mislead the clinician to strip or trim more from a tooth than is necessary, thus resulting in gaps occurring between two neighboring teeth after treatment. Moreover, such limitations may mislead the clinician to strip or trim less from a tooth than is necessary, and/or strip or trim in the wrong region, thus resulting in insufficient space is generated, which hinders tooth to be moved to its target position. In addition, after stripping of the tooth, the stripped IPR tooth geometry cannot be readily visualized in the virtual treatment. Moreover, after such stripping, a clinician cannot be adequately assured whether a stripped or trimmed tooth has sufficient spacing or is still in collision with adjacent teeth, making further adjustment difficult. Since the stripped geometry for the teeth is not adequately represented, the incorrect computation of the collision between teeth during treatment results. Summary of the Invention In accordance with various aspects of the present invention, a system and methods for modeling and application of interproximal reduction (IPR) of teeth to facilitate orthodontic treatment is provided. Such methods for modeling of IPR tooth geometry can comprise generation and construction of the IPR tooth geometry by a modifying the tooth geometry, such as by stripping/trimming or deforming processes, .or any other local or applied modification processes of the IPR tooth geometry, such as by extrusion, intrusion, rounding, smoothing and the like. Moreover, such processes can be used alone or suitably combined to generate and construct the modified IPR tooth geometry.

Detailed Description The present invention may be described herein in terms of various components and processing steps. It should be appreciated that such components and steps may be realized by any number of hardware and software components configured to perform the specified functions. For example, the present invention may employ various electronic control devices, visual display devices, input terminals and the like, which may carry out a variety of functions under the control of one or more control systems, microprocessors or other control devices. In addition, the present invention may be practiced in any number of orthodontic contexts and the exemplary embodiments relating to a system and method for modeling and application of interproximal tooth reduction to facilitate orthodontic treatment as described herein are merely a few of the exemplary applications for the invention. For example, the principles, features and methods discussed may be applied to any orthodontic treatment application. In accordance with various aspects of the present invention, a system and method for modeling and application of interproximal tooth reduction to facilitate orthodontic treatment are provided. For example, with reference to Figure 1A, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a method for modeling of IPR tooth geometry (104) is configured within a treatment methodology (100) that initially determines in a process whether stripping is needed for two neighboring teeth (102), e.g., at a final stage or position or other interim stages. If stripping is needed as determined within process (102), method for modeling of IPR (104) comprising the construction and/or calculation of the IPR tooth model or geometry is then conducted. The methods for modeling of (IPR) tooth geometry can comprise generation and construction of a modified IPR tooth geometry by stripping/trimming or deforming processes, or any other local or applied modification processes of the IPR tooth geometry, such as by extrusion, intrusion, rounding, smoothing and the like. Moreover, such processes can be used alone or suitably combined to generate and construct the modified IPR tooth geometry. In accordance with exemplary embodiment a stripping plane is constructed to determine the amount of stripping or trimming for two neighboring teeth, in other words, the volume to be removed between two neighboring teeth. In addition, such a determination can suitably include the specifying of how to conduct the stripping or trimming process, such as the region and amount of stripping for each of the neighboring teeth. It should be noted that the terms "stripping" or "trimming" are used interchangeably when referring to the removal of tooth volume of the IPR tooth geometry. After stripping of the tooth, the modified tooth geometry can be reconstructed to enable the clinician to visualize the stripped or trimmed geometry, as well as calculate collision/gap at each treatment stage. As a result, the application of the IPR tooth model by the clinician can occur to facilitate teeth movement planning (106). While the IPR modeling and stripping within treatment methodology (100) may be described and/or illustrated as being based on the final stage or position of teeth, it should be noted that the stripping can be distributed to multiple stages, anywhere from initial stage to final stage. Thus, multiple IPR tooth geometry models can also be generated, wherein such multiple IPR tooth models correspond to any one or all stripping or trimming stages, i.e., multiple, changeable or stage-dependent geometry models can be realized for any or all stripping or trimming stages. Similarly, while the stripping amount calculations described are based on the final stage, wherein the stripping amount comprises the total stripping amount, in other embodiments, the stripping amount can be suitably distributed to one or more stages from initial stage to final stage, with the sum of the multiple stripping amounts comprising the total stripping amount. Treatment methodology (100) and/or the processes within can be suitably provided from one or more control systems configured for providing the disclosed functions. Such control systems can comprise one or more microprocessors, memory systems and/or input/output devices for processing and/or modeling data and information, and can comprise one or more software algorithms configured for generating complete tooth modeling and/or performing other functions set forth herein. The determining of whether stripping is needed for two neighboring teeth (102) can be conducted in various manners through use of an exemplary control system. For example, with additional reference to Figure 1B, a control system can initiate determining of whether stripping is needed (102) by loading of one or more segmented teeth files (108) into a host computer or other processing system of the control system. Next, the transformation for each tooth at its final stage can be obtained (110) to then apply the transformation to vertices of each tooth (112). The control system can suitably select a particular tooth as the first tooth on the patient's jaw (114) to be checked for stripping requirements, and then determine the neighboring teeth (116) for the first tooth. The control system can then check to see whether overlap with its neighboring teeth exists (118/120), and then proceed to construct the IPR model (104) if overlap for the tooth with its neighboring teeth exists. Although method for determining if stripping is needed for two neighboring teeth (102) can suitably comprise loading of teeth files (108) and getting and applying the transformation to vertices of each tooth to potentially be stripped (110/112), any other methodology, steps or processes for preparing teeth to determine whether overlap exists can be utilized. After proceeding to construct the IPR model (104), method 100 can then determine whether to proceed to the next tooth and again determine whether stripping is needed (102), or whether to proceed to teeth movement planning (106) if all teeth have been checked. To determine whether to proceed to the next tooth, treatment method 100 can comprise the steps of determining whether a tooth that has been checked or had an IPR model constructed is the last tooth on the patient's jaw (122), and then if so, proceed to planning (106). If not the last tooth, method 100 can then proceed to the next tooth on the jaw (124) and finding the neighboring teeth (118) for such next tooth. Thereafter, checking of the overlap 118, constructing of IPR tooth model (104) and/or proceeding to determine whether the next tooth is the last one on the patient's jaw (122) can again be conducted before proceeding to teeth movement planning (106). Constructing of the IPR tooth model (104) is suitably configured to specify how to conduct the stripping process, such as the region and amount of stripping or trimming for each of the neighboring teeth. With reference to Figures 2, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a method for constructing of the IPR tooth model 200 comprises the constructing of a stripping plane (202), such as the stripping plane 302 for two neighboring teeth A and B illustrated in Figure 3A. Using the stripping plane to model the IPR of the tooth (204), method 200 for constructing of the IPR tooth model can then determine the stripping amount (206), such as for example stripping amounts 304 (d1) and 306 (d2) illustrated in Figure 3B. In accordance with an example not relating to the invention, rather than the constructing of a stripping surface comprising a stripping plane (202), an exemplary method for constructing of the IPR tooth model 200 can comprise the constructing of another stripping surface configuration, such as a spline surface suitably defined by control points. For example, such a spline surface can be generated by any conventional methodology for providing spline surfaces, such as B-Spline, Bezier, Hermite, Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) or any other appropriate surface, through control points associated with a spline surface. Similarly, rather than a stripping surface, such as spline surfaces or stripping planes, a method for constructing of the IPR tooth model can comprise the constructing of any other IPR reference for defining an IPR tooth model. Upon generation and constructing of the stripping surface or other IPR references to model the IPR geometry of the tooth (204), method 200 for constructing of the IPR tooth model can then determine the stripping amount (206). With reference to Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6, an exemplary method 400 for constructing the stripping plane is illustrated. Such a method is conducted when two neighboring teeth are determined to have overlap, such as neighboring teeth A and B and overlap 308 in Figure 3A. Method 400 suitably initiates with the constructing a first plane in a first tooth, e.g., tooth A, and a second plane in a second tooth, e.g., tooth B (402). To construct such planes, local coordinate systems or other appropriate references for neighboring teeth A and B are utilized, such as that illustrated in Figure 5. For example, a plane A is constructed through the origin of the tooth A local coordinate system and whose normal is in the Y-axis direction of the tooth A local coordinate system, while a plane B is constructed through the origin of the tooth B local coordinate system and whose normal is in the Y-axis direction of the tooth B local coordinate system. For example, representative plane A (602) and plane B (604) are illustrated with additional reference to Figure 6. Instead of local coordinate systems being utilized, other appropriate references such as a facial axis of the clinical crown (FACC) line, an facial-axis (FA) point, a tooth center or any other clinical or geometry feature capable of providing references to facilitate construction of the planes contemplated herein. Next, method 400 finds the intersection of plane A (602) and plane B (604) that comprises a straight line (404), in other words, finds an intersection line. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a projection plane that is perpendicular to the intersection line is then constructed, and then an intersection point between the intersection line and projection plane is determined. For example, with reference to Figure 6 that comprises a view of the projection plane, intersection line (606) appears as a single point when viewed on the projection plane, with the intersection of line (606) and the projection plane defining the intersection point. While the projection plane can be suitably constructed by constructing planes A and B (402), finding the intersection line (404) and constructing the projection plane perpendicular to the intersection line, the projection plane can be suitably constructed in various other manners in accordance with other exemplary embodiments. For example, in accordance with another exemplary embodiment, the normal of the projection plane can be determined through the equation: Normal vector of Projection Plane=WA*NZA+WB*NZB where NZA is the unit vector of the Z-axis of the local coordinate system for tooth A and NZB is the unit vector of the Z-axis of the local coordinate system for tooth B, allowing construction of the projection plane, and WA and WB are the weight coefficients of NZA and NZA with WA≥0, WB≥0 and WA+WB=1. For example, weight coefficients WA and WB can each comprise ½, e.g., for equal weighting and thus impact of weight coefficients WA and WB, or any other suitable ratio (WA:WB). For example, when NZA direction is more preferred by a clinician, the ratio is greater-than 1, i.e. WA> WB. When NZB direction is more preferred by a clinician, the ratio is less than 1, i.e. WA<WB. If neither of them is preferred, the ratio can simply selected as 1, i.e. WA=WB=0.5. In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, the normal of the projection plane can also be determined through the equation: Normal vector of Projection Plane=ΣWi*NZi where NZi is the unit vector of the Z-axis of the local coordinate system for tooth i and n is the total tooth number on the patient's jaw and Wi is the weight coefficient of NZi with Wi≥0, and Σ Wi=1. If no preference of NZi's direction exists, each Wi can simply selected equally as i/n. When the direction of NZi is more preferred, its corresponding Wi is greater than i/n. When certain NZi's direction is less preferred, its corresponding Wi is less than i/n. In accordance with yet another exemplary embodiment, the arch form curve can be used to construct the projection plane. An arch form curve is a smooth curve that is an approximation of all facial axis (FA) points on a patient's jaw. Ideally, an arch form curve comprises the optimal position of FA points after treatment. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, the arch form curve is created by the FA points at final stage. On the arch form curve, an intermediate point between an FA point on Tooth A and an FA point on Tooth B is found to construct an osculating plane, which is used as the projection plane. In accordance with yet another exemplary embodiment, the occlusal plane can be used as the projection plane. The occlusal plane is constructed for the lower arch. For well aligned teeth, the occlusal plane is the plane which passes through the tips of the front incisors and highest points of the first molars in such a way that all teeth points (except the points of canines) are below the plane. In an exemplary embodiment, the occlusal plane is the plane which best approximates the mentioned four points. After finding the intersection point (406), contours associated with the first tooth A and the second tooth B are determined (408). In this process, all the vertices of the crown surface of Tooth A are projected on the projection plane, with the contour of the projection points comprising contour A, e.g., a contour 608 illustrated in Figure 6, and all the vertices of the crown surface of tooth B are projected on the projection plane, with the contour of the projection points comprising contour B, e.g., a contour 610 illustrated in Figure 6. Next, a tangent line for contour A (608) and a tangent line for contour B (610) that go through the intersection point are found (410). For example, a tangent line A (612) and a tangent line B (614) that pass through intersection point 606 in Figure 6 can be determined. Next, a normal line is constructed, whose direction determines the normal direction for the stripping plane (412). In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, with additional reference to Figure 6, a bisector 616 is calculated from the intersection angle formed by tangent line A (612) and tangent line B (614). A normal line 618 is constructed that lies in the projection plane and is perpendicular to bisector 616. Normal line 618 can also be constructed in other manners. For example, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the direction vector of normal line 618 can be determined through the equation: Direction Vector of Normal Line=WA*NYA+WB*NYB where NYA is the unit vector of the Y-axis of the local coordinate system for tooth A and NYB is the unit vector of the Y-axis of the local coordinate system for tooth B, and WA and WB are the weight coefficients of NYA and NYB with WA≥0, WB≥0 and WA+WB=1. For example, weight coefficients WA and WB can each comprise ½, e.g., for equal weighting and thus impact of weight coefficients WA and WB, or any other suitable ratio (WA:WB). When NYA's direction is more preferred, the ratio is greater than 1, i.e. WA> WB. When NYB's direction is more preferred, the ratio is less than 1, i.e. WA<WB. If neither of them is preferred, the ratio can simply selected as 1, i.e. WA=WB=0.5. In accordance with yet another exemplary embodiment, the arch form curve can be used to construct the normal line 618 and direction. On the arch form curve, an intermediate point between an FA point of Tooth A and an FA point on Tooth B is found and the tangent vector at this intermediate point is used as the direction vector of normal line 618. Regardless of the methodology used to construct normal line 618, the direction of normal line 618 comprises the normal direction of the stripping plane. In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, an intermediate point that comprises a midpoint between the endpoints of contours of tooth A (608) and tooth B (610) is then determined (414). For example, the rightmost point of contour A (608) in the normal direction is determined as a first endpoint A (620), and the leftmost point of contour B (610) in the normal direction is determined as a second endpoint B (622). A midpoint 624 of the line segment between endpoints A (620) and B (622) can then be found. Having identified midpoint 624, a stripping plane 626 can be suitably constructed (416) that goes through midpoint 624 and whose normal direction comprises the direction of normal line 618. Such use of midpoint 624 is suited when two neighboring teeth A and B are to be stripped equally, i.e., wherein the ratio of stripping for teeth A and B is a 1:1 ratio. However, in accordance with other exemplary embodiments, when different amounts of stripping are to be conducted for two neighboring teeth A and B, another intermediate point between endpoint A (620) and endpoint B (622) can be suitably utilized. For example, when different amounts of stripping are needed, the normal of stripping plane 626 can first be determined. Next, different amounts of stripping for two neighboring teeth A and B can then be determined automatically, such as by calculating the ratio based on the size or volume for two neighboring teeth A and B, or interactively, such as by allowing a clinician to access a user interface and manually specify the ratio of the two stripping amounts. Then the stripping plane can be determined by normal line 618 and the intermediate point as determined by the selected ratio of the two stripping amounts of Tooth A and Tooth B. With reference again to Figure 2, having constructed a stripping plane (202), the stripping plane can then be used to model the IPR (204). For example, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, with additional reference to Figure 7, a left stripping plane 702 and a right stripping plane 704 can be used to trim the tooth three-dimensional model, with the trimmed tooth model being used as the IPR tooth model for further treatment planning. In accordance with other examples not relating to the invention, rather than using the stripping plane to facilitate trimming of the three-dimensional IPR tooth geometry, another type of stripping surface can be utilized, such as spline surface. In accordance with another exemplary embodiment, rather than using a trimmed tooth model to obtain the modified IPR tooth geometry, an exemplary method can use a deformed tooth model to provide the IPR tooth model. For example, the geometry of the vertices that are located on the left of left stripping plane 702 or the right of right stripping plane 704 can be adjusted by projecting all of the points on the left of the left stripping plane onto left stripping plane 702, and all of the points on the right of the right stripping plane onto right stripping plane 704, with such a change in coordinates of the vertices resulting in a deformed tooth model that can then be used as the IPR tooth model. In accordance with other exemplary embodiments, rather than projecting all such points onto the left or right stripping planes 702 and 704, such projecting of points can be provided onto other stripping surfaces, such as spline surfaces and the like. Such a deformed tooth model can provide another optional implementation of IPR tooth modeling that may be simpler or easier as compared with the various other exemplary methods. Moreover, other local or applied modification processes of the IPR tooth geometry, such as by extrusion, intrusion, rounding, smoothing and the like can also be suitably utilized, alone or in combination with the stripping/trimming and/or deformed tooth modeling processes based on the potential for collision between any neighboring teeth. Based on the developed IPR tooth models, the amount of stripping can then be determined (206) as the amount of stripping can be both quantified and visualized. For example, the amount of stripping can be represented by the distance from the leftmost/rightmost point of a stripped tooth model to the stripping plane or stripping surface. Also the amount of stripping can be represented by the trimmed volume. Thus, for example, the trimmed or deformed IPR tooth model can comprise the 3D digital model which can be visualized in the computer system. After a tooth has been stripped to avoid collision, the geometry of the tooth will be changed, as well as the approximate relationship between that tooth and any neighboring teeth. When such stripping occurs, there are various possible outcomes for the teeth resulting from stripping based on the IPR model, such as the development of a gap between the neighboring teeth, a reduction in the collision, and/or the teeth still contacting each other. Such post-stripping approximation information gathered from the IPR tooth model can be provided in a collision/gap report to the treatment provider to facilitate further stage planning, rescheduling and/or adjustments to treatment plans. For example, with reference to Figures 8A (post-stripping) and 8B (pre-stripping), exemplary collision/gap reports can suitably identify the amount of collision and/or gap between teeth at various stages of treatment. Thus, for example, while the amount of collision between teeth 1(25) and 1(24) slowly increases through stage 7 and can comprise 0.50mm in a pre-stripping model at stage 7, after stripping through the IPR tooth model, the collision is eliminated between those neighboring teeth 1(25) and 1(24) throughout the staging process. Meanwhile, the amount of collision between teeth 1(24) and 2(23) increases through stage 7 to approximately 0.39mm in a pre-stripping model, after stripping with the IPR tooth model, the collision between those neighboring teeth 1(24) and 2(23) is substantially reduced in stages 1 through 5 with some minimal collision amounts, and eliminated in stages 6 and 7. Through such a collision/gap report, further stage planning, rescheduling and/or adjustments can be set forth by the treatment provider to facilitate improved treatment, using the collision/gap reports as a useful reference.
