TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device. BACKGROUND ART Liquid crystal display devices have been applied to, for example, watches, calculators, a variety of household electrical appliances, measuring equipment, panels used in automobiles, word processors, electronic notebooks, printers, computers, and television sets. Representative examples of types of liquid crystal display devices include a TN (twisted nematic) type, an STN (super twisted nematic) type, a DS (dynamic scattering) type, a GH (guest-host) type, an IPS (in-plane switching) type, an OCB (optically compensated birefringence) type, an ECB (electrically controlled birefringence) type, a VA (vertical alignment) type, a CSH (color super homeotropic) type, and an FLC (ferroelectric liquid crystal) type. Regarding a drive system, multiplex driving has become popular instead of typical static driving; and an active matrix (AM) in which, for example, a TFT (thin film transistor) or a TFD (thin film diode) is used for driving has become standard rather than a passive matrix in recent years. As illustrated in FIG. 1, in a general color liquid crystal display device, a transparent electrode layer (3a) as a common electrode and a color filter layer (2) are disposed between one of two substrates (1) and one of alignment films (4) provided so as to correspond thereto, a pixel electrode layer (3b) is disposed between the other substrate and the other alignment film, the substrates are disposed such that the alignment films face each other, and a liquid crystal layer (5) is disposed therebetween. The color filter layer is a color filter consisting of a black matrix, a red layer (R), a green layer (G), a blue layer (B), and optionally a yellow layer (Y). Impurities remaining in liquid crystal materials used in a liquid crystal layer have a large effect on the electrical properties of a display device, and the impurities have been therefore highly controlled. In terms of materials used in alignment films, it has been known that impurities remaining in the alignment films directly contacting a liquid crystal layer shift to the liquid crystal layer with the result that the impurities affect the electrical properties of the liquid crystal layer; hence, the relationship between the properties of liquid crystal display devices and impurities contained in the materials of alignment films have been being studied. Also in terms of materials used in a color filter layer, such as organic pigments, it is believed that impurities contained therein have an effect on a liquid crystal layer as in the materials of alignment films. However, since an alignment film and a transparent electrode are disposed between the color filter layer and the liquid crystal layer, it has been believed that direct effect thereof on the liquid crystal layer is significantly smaller than that of the materials of the alignment film. In general, however, the thickness of the alignment film is only not more than 0.1 μm, and the thickness of the transparent electrode that is a common electrode disposed on the color filter layer side is not more than 0.5 μm even in the case where the thickness is increased to enhance the electric conductivity. Hence, the color filter layer and the liquid crystal layer are not in a state in which they are completely isolated from each other, and the color filter layer may therefore cause problems owing to impurities which are contained in the color filter layer and which pass through the alignment film and the transparent electrode, such as a decrease in the voltage holding ratio (VHR) of the liquid crystal layer and defective display including voids due to increased ion density (ID), uneven alignment, and screen burn-in. Techniques for overcoming defective display caused by impurities present in a pigment contained in the color filter layer have been studied, such as a technique in which dissolution of impurities in liquid crystal is controlled by use of a pigment in which the amount of an extract from the pigment by ethyl formate is at a predetermined level or lower (Patent Literature 1) and a technique in which dissolution of impurities in liquid crystal is controlled by use of a specific pigment for a blue layer (Patent Literature 2). These techniques, however, are substantially not different from merely reducing the impurity content in a pigment and are insufficient in improvements to overcome defective display even in a current situation in which a technique for purifying pigments has been advanced. In another disclosed technique, attention is paid to the relationship between organic impurities contained in a color filter layer and a liquid crystal composition, the degree in which the organic impurities are less likely to be dissolved in a liquid crystal layer is represented by the hydrophobic parameter of liquid crystal molecules contained in the liquid crystal layer, and the hydrophobic parameter is adjusted to be at a predetermined level or more; furthermore, since such a hydrophobic parameter has a correlation with a —OCF3 group present at an end of a liquid crystal molecule, a liquid crystal composition is prepared so as to contain a predetermined amount or more of a liquid crystal compound having a —OCF3 group at an end of each liquid crystal molecule thereof (Patent Literature 3). Also in such disclosure, however, the technique is substantially for reducing effects of impurities present in a pigment on the liquid crystal layer, and a direct relationship between the properties of a colorant itself used in the color filter layer, such as a dye or a pigment, and the structure of a liquid crystal material is not considered; thus, problems of defective display in highly-developed liquid crystal display devices have not been overcome.

The liquid crystal layer of the liquid crystal display device of the present invention can be used in a wide range of nematic phase-isotropic liquid phase transition temperature (Tni); this temperature range is preferably from 60 to 120° C., more preferably from 70 to 100° C., and especially preferably from 70 to 85° C. The dielectric anisotropy is preferably in the range of −2.0 to −6.0, more preferably −2.5 to −5.0, and especially preferably −2.5 to −4.0 at 25° C. The refractive index anisotropy is preferably from 0.08 to 0.13, and more preferably from 0.09 to 0.12 at 25° C. In particular, the refractive index anisotropy is preferably from 0.10 to 0.12 for a thin cell gap or is preferably from 0.08 to 0.10 for a thick cell gap. The rotational viscosity (γ1) is preferably not more than 150, more preferably not more than 130, and especially preferably not more than 120. In the liquid crystal layer of the liquid crystal display device of the present invention, it is preferred that the function Z of the rotational viscosity and the refractive index anisotropy have a specific value. [ Math .  1 ]  Z = γ 1 / Δ   n 2 (where γ1 represents rotational viscosity, and Δn represents refractive index anisotropy) Z is preferably not more than 13000, more preferably not more than 12000, and especially preferably not more than 11000. In the case where the liquid crystal layer of the liquid crystal display device of the present invention is used in an active-matrix display device, the liquid crystal layer needs to have a specific resistance of not less than 1012 (Ω·m), preferably 1013 (Ω·m), and more preferably not less than 1014 (Ω·m). In addition to the above-mentioned compounds, the liquid crystal layer of the liquid crystal display device of the present invention may contain, for example, general nematic liquid crystal, smectic liquid crystal, cholesteric liquid crystal, antioxidants, ultraviolet absorbers, and polymerizable monomers, depending on the application thereof. The polymerizable monomer is preferably a difunctional monomer represented by General Formula (V). (where X1 and X2 each independently represent a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; Sp1 and Sp2 each independently represent a single bond, an alkylene group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or —O—(CH2)s— (where s represents an integer from 2 to 7, and the oxygen atom is bonded to an aromatic ring); Z1 represents —OCH2—, —CH2O—, —COO—, —OCO—, —CF2O—, —OCF2—, —CH2CH2—, —CF2CF2—, —CH═CH—OCO—, —CH═CH—OCO—, —COO—CH═CH—, —OCO—CH═CH—, —COO—CH2CH2—, —OCO—CH2CH2—, —CH2CH2—COO—, —CH2CH2—OCO—, —COO—CH2—, —OCO—CH2—, —CH2—COO—, —CH2—OCO—, —CY1═CY2— (where Y1 and Y2 each independently represent a fluorine atom or a hydrogen atom), —C≡C—, or a single bond; and C represents a 1,4-phenylene group, a trans-1,4-cyclohexylene group, or a single bond, and in each 1,4-phenylene group in the formula, any hydrogen atom is optionally substituted with a fluorine atom) Diacrylate derivatives in which X1 and X2 each represent a hydrogen atom and dimethacrylate derivatives in which X1 and X2 are each a methyl group are preferred, and compounds in which one of X1 and X2 represents a hydrogen atom and in which the other one thereof represents a methyl group are also preferred. Among these compounds, the rate of polymerization is the highest in diacrylate derivatives and the lowest in dimethacrylate derivatives, and the rate of polymerization of unsymmetrical compounds is intermediate therebetween. Hence, an appropriate compound can be employed on the basis of the intended application. In PSA display devices, dimethacrylate derivatives are especially preferred. Sp1 and Sp2 each independently represent a single bond, an alkylene group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or —O—(CH2)s—; in an application to PSA display devices, at least one of Sp1 and Sp2 is preferably a single bond, and compounds in which Sp1 and Sp2 each represent a single bond and compounds in which one of Sp1 and Sp2 is a single bond and in which the other one thereof represents an alkylene group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms or —O—(CH2)s— are preferred. In this case, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 is preferably employed, and s preferably ranges from 1 to 4. Z1 is preferably —OCH2—, —CH2O—, —COO—, —OCO—, —CF2O—, —OCF2—, —CH2CH2—, —CF2CF2—, or a single bond; more preferably —COO—, —OCO—, or a single bond; and especially preferably a single bond. C represents a 1,4-phenylene group of which any hydrogen atom is optionally substituted with a fluorine atom, a trans-1,4-cyclohexylene group, or a single bond; and a 1,4-phenylene group and a single bond are preferred. In the case where C does not represent a single bond but represents a ring structure, Z1 preferably represents a linking group as well as a single bond; in the case where C represents a single bond, Z1 is preferably a single bond. From these viewpoints, a preferred ring structure between Sp1 and Sp2 in General Formula (V) is particularly as follows. In General Formula (V), in the case where C represents a single bond and where the ring structure consists of two rings, the ring structure is preferably represented by any of Formulae (Va-1) to (Va-5), more preferably Formulae (Va-1) to (Va-3), and especially preferably Formula (Va-1). (in the formulae, the two ends of each structure are bonded to Sp1 and Sp2, respectively) Polymerizable compounds having such skeletons enable uneven display to be reduced or eliminated in PSA liquid crystal display devices because such polymerizable compounds have optimum alignment regulating force after being polymerized and thus produce a good alignment state. Accordingly, the polymerizable monomer is especially preferably any of compounds represented by General Formulae (V-1) to (V-4), and most preferably the compound represented by General Formula (V-2). (in the formulae, Sp2 represents an alkylene group having 2 to 5 carbon atoms) In the case where the polymerizable monomer is added, polymerization is carried out even without a polymerization initiator; however, a polymerization initiator may be used to promote the polymerization. Examples of the polymerization initiator include benzoin ethers, benzophenones, acetophenones, benzyl ketals, and acyl phosphine oxides. In order to enhance storage stability, a stabilizer may be added. Examples of usable stabilizers include hydroquinones, hydroquinone monoalkylethers, tertiary butylcatechol, pyrogallols, thiophenols, nitro compounds, β-naphthylamines, β-naphthols, and nitroso compounds. The polymerizable-monomer-containing liquid crystal layer is useful in liquid crystal display devices, and especially useful in liquid crystal display devices driven by an active matrix; hence, such a liquid crystal layer can be used in liquid crystal display devices of a PSA mode, PSVA mode, VA mode, IPS mode, and ECB mode. The polymerizable monomer contained in the polymerizable-monomer-containing liquid crystal layer is polymerized by being irradiated with ultraviolet with the result that liquid crystal molecules can be aligned, and such a liquid crystal layer is used in liquid crystal display devices in which the birefringence of the liquid crystal composition is utilized to control the amount of light that is to be transmitted. Such a liquid crystal layer is useful in liquid crystal display devices, such as an AM-LCD (active matrix liquid crystal display device), a TN (nematic liquid crystal display device), an STN-LCD (super twisted nematic liquid crystal display device), an OCB-LCD, and an IPS-LCD (in-plane switching liquid crystal display device), particularly useful in an AM-LCD, and can be used in transmissive or reflective liquid crystal display devices. (Color Filter) The color filter used in the present invention contains an organic pigment, so that light having a specific wavelength can be absorbed and that light having another specific wavelength can be transmitted. Any substrate can be used provided that light can pass through it, and a proper substrate may be selected on the basis of application. Examples thereof include substrates made of resins or inorganic materials, and a glass substrate is particularly preferred. The color filter includes the substrate and the organic pigment, and the organic pigment may be dispersed in the substrate or present only on the surface of the substrate. The organic pigment may be dispersed in resin, and the resin may be formed into a shape; alternatively, the organic pigment may be dispersed in the form of a coating on the surface of the substrate. A color filter in which a dispersion liquid of the pigment has been applied to the surface of a glass substrate, for example, can be suitably used in luminous display devices such as liquid crystal display devices and organic EL display devices. The color filter can have any shape; arbitrary shapes including a plate, a film, a lens, a sphere, a shape partially having a three-dimensional roughness, and a shape having a fine uneven surface profile can be employed. [Organic Pigment] Examples of the organic pigment used in the present invention include phthalocyanine pigments, insoluble azo pigments, azo lake pigments, anthraquinone pigments, quinacridone pigments, dioxazine pigments, diketopyrrolopyrrole pigments, anthrapyrimidine pigments, anthanthrone pigments, indanthrone pigments, flavanthrone pigments, perinone pigments, perylene pigments, thioindigo pigments, triarylmethane pigments, isoindolinone pigments, isoindolin pigments, metal complex pigments, quinophthalone pigments, and dye lake pigments. A proper pigment can be determined on the basis of the wavelength of light to be transmitted. In the case of a red color filter, a red pigment can be used; specifically, pigments having a high light transmittance for light with a wavelength ranging from 600 nm to 700 nm can be employed. Such pigments can be used alone or in combination. Specific examples of a preferred pigment include C.I. Pigment Red 81, 122, 177, 209, 242, and 254 and Pigment Violet 19. Among these, C.I. Pigment Red 254 is particularly preferred and has a maximum light transmittance for light having a wavelength from 660 nm to 700 nm. The red color filter can further contain at least one organic pigment selected from the group consisting of C.I. Pigment Orange 38 and 71 and C.I. Pigment Yellow 150, 215, 185, 138, and 139 for toning. In the case of a green color filter, a green pigment can be used; in particular, pigments having a maximum light transmittance for light having a wavelength from 500 nm to 600 nm can be employed. Such pigments can be used alone or in combination. Specific examples of a preferred pigment include C.I. Pigment Green 7, 36, and 58. Among these, C.I. Pigment Green 58 is particularly preferred and has a maximum light transmittance for light having a wavelength from 510 nm to 550 nm. The green color filter can further contain at least one organic pigment selected from the group consisting of C.I. Pigment Yellow 150, 215, 185, and 138 for toning. In the case of a blue color filter, a blue pigment can be used; in particular, pigments having a maximum light transmittance for light having a wavelength from 400 nm to 500 nm can be employed. Such pigments can be used alone or in combination. Specific examples of a preferred pigment include C.I. Pigment Blue 15:3 and 15:6 and triarylmethane pigments such as C.I. Pigment Blue 1 and/or a triarylmethane pigment represented by General Formula (1) (in the formula, R1 to R6 each independently represent a hydrogen atom, an optionally substituted alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, or an optionally substituted aryl group; in the case where R1 to R6 are each an optionally substituted alkyl group, R1, R3, and R5 may be combined to adjoining R2, R4, and R6 to form ring structures, respectively; X1 and X2 each independently represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, or an optionally substituted alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms; Z— is at least one anion selected from heteropolyoxometalate anion represented by (P2MoyW18-yO62)6-/6 in which y is an integer of 0, 1, 2, or 3, heteropolyoxometalate anion represented by (SiMoW11O40)4-/4, and lacunary Dawson-type phosphotungstic acid heteropolyoxometalate anion; and in the case where one molecule has multiple structures represented by General Formula (1), these structures may be the same as or different from each other). In General Formula (1), R1 to R6 may be the same as or different from each other. Hence, —NRR moieties (RR represents any of combinations of R1 and R2, R3 and R4, and R5 and R6) may be symmetric or asymmetric. C.I. Pigment Blue 15:3 has a maximum light transmittance for light having a wavelength from 440 nm to 480 nm, C.I. Pigment Blue 15:6 has a maximum light transmittance for light having a wavelength from 430 nm to 470 nm, and the triarylmethane pigment has a maximum light transmittance for light having a wavelength from 410 nm to 450 nm. The blue color filter can further contain at least one organic pigment selected from the group consisting of C.I. Pigment Violet 23 and 37 and C.I. Pigment Blue 15, 15:1, 15:2, and 15:4 for toning. In the case where the color filter can be produced by a technique in which pigment dispersions prepared from the above-mentioned organic pigments are applied onto substrates, such pigment dispersions may contain known pigment dispersants and solvents in addition to the organic pigments. Dispersion liquids in which the organic pigments have been preliminarily dispersed in solvents or pigment dispersants are prepared, and the prepared dispersion liquids can be applied to a substrate; examples of a technique for the application include spin coating, roller coating, an ink jet technique, spray coating, and printing. The organic pigments applied to the substrate are dried, and production of the color filter may be completed in this state. In the case where the pigment dispersions contain curable resins, curing by exposure to heat or an active energy ray may be carried out to complete the production of the color filter. Furthermore, an additional step may be carried out, in which a volatile component in the coating is removed by heating with a heater, such as a hot plate or an oven, at 100 to 280° C. for a predetermined time (post-baking). [State of Pigment Particles in Color Filter] In the color filter used in the present invention, an organic pigment of which the particles have a particle size greater than 1000 nm has a volume fraction of not more than 1%, and an organic pigment of which the particles have a particle size ranging from 40 nm to 1000 nm has a volume fraction of not more than 25%. In the color filter, the state of the organic pigments which are present in the completed color filter has the largest effect on a reduction in defective display such as voids, uneven alignment, and screen burn-in. Defining the particles of the organic pigments which are present in the completed color filter enables the color filter to eliminate the above-mentioned defective display. The particles having a particle size ranging from 40 nm to 1000 nm are higher-order particles made by the agglomeration of primary particles, such as secondary particles, tertiary particles, or quaternary particles; and the volume fraction thereof is preferably not more than 15%. If particles having a particle size ranging from 100 nm to 1000 nm are excess, the particles affect a display state. The volume fraction of the particles having a particle size ranging from 100 nm to 1000 nm is preferably not more than 7%, and more preferably not more than 3%. In the organic pigments, coarse particles having a particle size greater than 1000 nm have an adverse effect on a display state and are therefore not preferred; hence, its content needs to be not more than 1%. The content may be measured by observing the surface of the color filter with, for instance, an appropriate optical microscope. [Ultra-Small Angle X-Ray Scattering Profile] The volume fraction of particles having a particle size of not more than 1000 nm can be determined by analysis of an ultra-small angle X-ray scattering profile obtained by ultra-small angle X-ray scattering. In particular, the determination of the volume fraction includes the following steps: the ultra-small angle X-ray scattering profile of an organic pigment (measured scattering profile) is obtained by ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (step (A)); assuming that the organic pigment consists of spherical particles each having a radius R and has dispersion in particle size distribution, its theoretical scattering profile is obtained from a hypothetical radius R1 and hypothetical normalized variance by simulation (step (B)); curve fitting of the theoretical scattering profile with the measured scattering profile is performed to obtain the residual sum of squares Z of the theoretical scattering profile and the measured scattering profile (step (C)); and other radii Rn+1 (n is an integer, Rn<Rn+1) and corresponding hypothetical normalized variance are added to form multiple particle size distribution models, the steps (B) and (C) are repeated n times until the residual sum of squares Z, which is obtained in the step (C), reaches 2% or lower, and at least one of the primary particle size of the organic pigment, the average particle size of higher-order particles thereof, the normalized variance, and the volume fraction is determined from the result of the curve fitting of the theoretical scattering profile with the measured scattering profile (step (D)). In the ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS), diffuse scattering and diffraction caused not only in a small angle region at a scattering angle of 0.1<(2θ)<10? but also in an ultra-small angle region at a scattering angle of 0°<(2θ)≦0.1° are simultaneously observed. In small angle X-ray scattering, in the case where a substance has regions each having a size approximately from 1 to 100 nm and a different electron density, the diffuse scattering of an X-ray can be observed from such a difference in the electron density; in the ultra-small angle X-ray scattering, in the case where a substance has regions each having a size approximately from 1 to 1000 nm and a different electron density, the diffuse scattering of an X-ray can be observed from such a difference in the electron density. The particle size of a measuring object is determined on the basis of the scattering angle and scattering intensity thereof. The main techniques which enable the ultra-small angle X-ray scattering are two techniques: use of an advanced technology for controlling an optical system, in which the width of the wavelength of an incident X-ray and a beam diameter are narrowed to reduce the background scattering intensity in an ultra-small angle region; and accurate measurement of part having a small scattering angle with a distance between the sample and a detector, so-called camera length, being elongated as much as possible. The former is mainly employed for ultra-small angle X-ray scattering with small equipment used in a laboratory. A program used to obtain particle size distribution from a small-angle X-ray scattering curve can be preferably a program such as NANO-solver (manufactured by Rigaku Corporation) or GIFT (manufactured by PANalytical B.V.). In measurement of the particle size properties of the organic pigment, sufficient scattering intensity can be measured when the brightness of an incident X-ray in an X-ray scattering apparatus is not less than 106 Brilliance (photons/sec/mm2/mrad2/0.1% bandwidth), and preferably not less than 107 Brilliance. In the case where the substrate of a coating is, for example, glass, an X-ray is easily absorbed, and thus the brightness of the incident X-ray is significantly insufficient; hence, in order to accurately measure the primary particle size of the organic pigment, the average particle size of higher-order particles thereof, the normalized variance, and the volume fraction, the brightness of the incident X-ray is preferably not less than 1016 Brilliance, and more preferably not less than 1018 Brilliance. In order to use a high-brightness X-ray source with not less than 1016 Brilliance, for instance, the light sources of the above-mentioned large-scale synchrotron radiation facilities, such as SPring-8 in Hyogo Prefecture and Photon Factory in Ibaraki Prefecture, can be used. In such facilities, an appropriate camera length can be determined to select the intended scattering region. Moreover, several types of metal absorber plates called attenuator can be used on the incident light side in order to produce sufficient scattering intensity, to prevent a sample from being damaged, and to protect a detector; and the exposure time can be properly adjusted to be approximately between 0.5 and 60 seconds to select measurement conditions suitable for a wide range of purposes. Examples of the attenuator include thin films made of Au, Ag, or molybdenum. In a specific process of the measurement, in the step (A), a color filter is attached to, for example, the sample holder or sample stage of a commercially available X-ray diffractometer, and then scattering intensity I is measured at each of scattering angles (2θ) less than 10° to obtain a small angle X-ray scattering profile (measured scattering profile). In an ultra-small angle scattering apparatus which is used for analyzing a coating on a glass substrate by synchrotron radiation, white light taken from a circular accelerator called a storage ring is monochromatized with a double crystal monochromator in order to employ a beam having a wavelength in an X-ray region (e.g., 1 Å) as a source, the beam is radiated to the coating attached to a sample stage, a two-dimensional detector is exposed to a scattered light for a predetermined time, the obtained scattering profile that is concentric circular is averaged to be one dimensional, the resulting profile is converted to scattering intensities I corresponding to scattering angles (2θ) less than 10°, thereby obtaining a small angle X-ray scattering profile (measured scattering profile). This procedure is defined as the step (A). Then, in the step (B), assuming that the organic pigment consists of spherical particles each having a radius R and has dispersion in particle size distribution, a theoretical scattering profile is obtained from a hypothetical radius R1 and hypothetical normalized variance by simulation with commercially available analytical software on the basis of the measured scattering profile. In general, in the case where a substance has regions with a difference in electron density Δρ(r), the scattering intensity I can be approximated as represented by Equation (1). [ Math .  2 ]  I  ( q ) = ( ∫ V  Δ   ρ  ( r )      q · r   r ) *  ∫ V  Δ   ρ  ( r )      q · r   r =  F  ( q )  2  S  ( q ) ( 1 ) In Equation (1), q represents a scattering vector, and V represents the domain of a volume integral and means that the whole substance is subjected to the integral. F(q) is a form factor, and S(q) is a structure factor; in the case where particles exist in a substance at random, S(q) is equal to 1. The scattering vector q is represented by Equation (2). [ Math .  3 ]  q = 4   π λ  sin  2   θ 2 ( 2 ) In Equation (2), λ is the wavelength of an X-ray, and 2θ is a scattering angle. If the particles are spheres each having a radius R, the form factor F(q) in Equation (1) is represented by Equation (3). [ Math .  4 ]  F  ( q ) = Δ   ρ  ∫ 0 2   π   ϕ  ∫ 0 π   θ  ∫ 0 R      qr   cos   θ  r 2  sin   θ   r = Δ   ρ  4   π q 3  ( sin  ( qR ) - qR   cos  ( qR ) ) ( 3 ) Accordingly, when the form factor F(q) is calculated on the basis of the assumption of the value of the hypothetical radius R, the scattering intensity I can be described from Equations (1), (2), and (3). Such scattering intensity I is, however, based merely on the assumption that particles in a substance each have a constant size (the radius R is constant). In an actual substance, to the contrary, particles rarely have a constant size but generally have a variation in size to some extent (dispersion in particle size distribution). In the present invention, since such an organic pigment having dispersion in particle size distribution needs to be subjected to correct and accurate measurement of particle size distribution, it is unavoidably necessary to assume dispersion in particle size distribution. In view of such dispersion in particle size distribution, the scattering intensity I can be obtained by gathering scattering derived from each of particles having various sizes. A distribution function used for assuming dispersion in particle size distribution can be a known distribution function employed in statistics; taking dispersion in particle size distribution in an actual substance into consideration, a gamma distribution function is preferred. The gamma distribution function is represented by Equation (4). [ Math .  5 ]  P R 0 M  ( R ) = 1 Γ  ( M )  ( M R 0 ) M   M · R R 0  R - 1 + M ( 4 ) In the equation, R0 is the average radius of spherical particles, and M is a parameter of the spread of particle size distribution. When it can be assumed that the particle size distribution in a substance can be obtained from such a gamma distribution function and that the scattering intensity I can be obtained by gathering scattering derived from each of particles having various radii R1 (the average radius is R0), the scattering intensity I in the case where dispersion in particle size distribution exists is represented by Equation (5) from Equations (3) and (4). [ Math .  6 ]  I  ( q , R 0 , M ) = ∫ 0 ∞   F  ( q , R )  2  P R 0 M  ( R )  1 R 3   R ( 5 ) M in Equation (5), which is a parameter of the spread of particle size distribution, is output as normalized variance σ(%) for an analytical result by conversion with Equation (6). [ Math .  7 ]  σ   ( % ) = 1 M × 100 ( 6 ) From Equation (5), the scattering intensity I at a scattering angle (20) is calculated from a hypothetical radius R1 and hypothetical normalized variance by simulation to obtain a theoretical scattering profile in the step (B). Then, in the step (C), the curve fitting of the theoretical scattering profile calculated from the scattering intensity I with the measured scattering profile is carried out by a least squares method. In the profile fitting, variables to be refined are an average particle size (nm) and normalized variance (%). The profile fitting is carried out such that the residual sum of squares Z of the measured profile and the theoretical scattering profile becomes minimum by a least squares method; and the smaller the residual sum of squares Z is, the higher the accuracy of the particle size analysis is. In general, at the residual sum of squares Z of lower than 2%, both of the profiles are visually substantially fitted to each other, which may be regarded as the convergence. The residual sum of squares Z is preferably lower than 1%, and more preferably lower than 0.5%. The average primary particle size and normalized variance which are variables at the convergence can be obtained as analytical results. In the case where X-ray scattering is observed also in an ultra-small angle scattering region in the step (A), the analytical range covers even a relatively large particle size. Hence, if one particle size distribution, namely one average primary particle size, and normalized variance are assumed in the step (B), the fitting analysis in the step C may result in insufficient lowering of the residual sum of squares Z and thus show unsatisfactory fitting of the measured profile to the theoretical scattering profile. The reason for it is presumed as follows: it is not that the only one particle size distribution exists but that several particle size distributions exist because of the presence of pigment particles having a larger particle size and higher-order agglomerates. A new particle size distribution model is therefore introduced on the basis of this presumption. In the step (D), other radii Rn+1 (n is an integer, Rn<Rn+1) and corresponding hypothetical normalized variance are added to form multiple particle size distribution models, and the steps (B) and (C) are repeated n times until the residual sum of squares Z, which is obtained in the step (C), reaches 2% or lower. Specifically, a new particle size distribution model for a larger average particle size is assumed, and the radius is determined as R2 (R2>R1). When the corresponding scattering intensities I are defined as I(1) and I(2), the left side of Equation (5) for scattering intensity is modified into Equations (7) and (8), respectively. [ Math .  8 ]  I  ( 1 ) = I  ( q , R 1 , M 1 ) = ∫ 0 ∞   F  ( q , R )  2  P R 1 M 1  ( R )  1 R 3   R ( 7 ) M1 is a parameter of the spread of the first particle size distribution. [ Math .  9 ]  I  ( 2 ) = I  ( q , R 2 , M 2 ) = ∫ 0 ∞   F  ( q , R )  2  P R 2 M 2  ( R )  1 R 3   R ( 8 ) M2 is a parameter of the spread of the second particle size distribution. Likewise, in the case where distributions at a third radius R3 or more are assumed, the scattering intensities can be I(3), I(4) . . . , and I(n). Total scattering intensity ITotal in a particle size distribution model having two average particle sizes is represented by Equation (9). [in-line-formulae]ITotal=k(1)I(1)+k(2)I(2) (9)[/in-line-formulae] k(1) and k(2) are scale factors which represent the composition ratios of corresponding distributions. Similarly, a particle size distribution model having three or more average particle sizes is assumed, and the total scattering intensity of n particle size distribution models in total can be represented by Equation (10). [in-line-formulae]ITotal=k(1)I(1)+k(2)I(2)+ . . . +k(n)I(n) (10)[/in-line-formulae] In the above-mentioned multiple particle size distributions, for example, the volume fractions w(1), w(2), . . . , and w(n) in n particle size distributions are in a ratio represented by Equation (11). [in-line-formulae]w(1):w(2): . . . :w(n)=k(1):k(2): . . . :k(n) (11)[/in-line-formulae] Variables refined in the profile fitting are the average particle size (nm) in each particle size distribution, normalized variance which shows the width of a corresponding particle size distribution (%), and the volume fraction in each particle size distribution (%). The profile fitting is carried out such that the value of Z which is the residual sum of squares of the measured profile and the total theoretical scattering profile becomes minimum, and then each variable is determined. If the profile fitting in the step (D) does not well converge, in other words, if the minimum value of the residual sum of squares Z cannot be determined, the cause of this circumstance may be that the types of variables to be determined are in excess. In this case, the normalized valiance of each particle size distribution may be fixed with reference to normalized valiance obtained in the step (C). Owing to this procedure, the profile fitting by a least squares method with fewer variables can easily converge. Thus, the average particle size (nm) in each particle size distribution, the normalized variance (%) thereof, and the volume fraction in each particle size distribution (%) can be obtained as analytical results. (Alignment Film) In the liquid crystal display device of the present invention, in the case where alignment films need to be provided on the liquid crystal composition sides of the first and second substrates to align the molecules of the liquid crystal composition, the alignment films are disposed between a color filter and the liquid crystal layer in the liquid crystal display device. Each alignment film, however, has a thickness of not more than 100 nm even when the thickness is large; hence, the alignment films do not completely block the interaction between a colorant used in the color filter, such as a pigment, and a liquid crystal compound used in the liquid crystal layer. In a liquid crystal display device in which an alignment film is not used, the interaction between a colorant used in the color filter, such as a pigment, and a liquid crystal compound used in the liquid crystal layer is larger. The material of the alignment films can be a transparent organic material such as polyimide, polyamide, BCB (benzocyclobutene polymer), or polyvinyl alcohol; in particular, polyimide alignment films formed though imidizing of a polyamic acid synthesized from diamine such as an aliphatic or alicyclic diamine (e.g., p-phenylenediamine and 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl methane), an aliphatic or alicyclic tetracarboxylic acid anhydride such as butanetetracarboxylic acid anhydride or 2,3,5-tricarboxycyclopentyl acetic acid anhydride, and an aromatic tetracarboxylic acid anhydride such as pyromellitic acid dianhydride are preferred. In this case, rubbing is generally carried out to give an alignment function; however, in the case where each alignment film is used as, for instance, a vertical alignment film, the alignment film can be used without the alignment function being developed. Materials usable for the alignment films may be materials in which compounds contain, for instance, chalcone, cinnamate, cinnamoyl, or an azo group. Such materials may be used in combination with another material such as polyimide or polyamide; in this case, the alignment films may be rubbed or treated by a photo-alignment technique. In general formation of alignment films, the above-mentioned material of the alignment films is applied onto substrates by, for example, spin coating to form resin films; besides, uniaxial stretching or a Langmuir-Blodgett technique can be employed. (Transparent Electrode) In the liquid crystal display device of the present invention, the material of a transparent electrode can be a conductive metal oxide. Usable metal oxides are indium oxide (In2O3), tin oxide (SnO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), indium tin oxide (In2O3—SnO2), indium zinc oxide (In2O3—ZnO), niobium-doped titanium dioxide (Ti1-xbxO2), fluorine-doped tin oxide, graphene nanoribbon, and metal nanowires; among these, zinc oxide (ZnO), indium tin oxide (In2O3—SnO2), and indium zinc oxide (In2O3—ZnO) are preferred. A transparent conductive film formed of any of such materials can be patterned by photo-etching or a technique involving use of a mask. The liquid crystal display device is combined with a backlight for various applications such as liquid crystal television sets, computer monitors, mobile phones, smartphone displays, laptops, portable information terminals, and digital signage. Examples of the back light include cold-cathode tube backlights and virtually white backlights with two peak wavelengths or backlights with three peak wavelengths; in the backlight with two or three peak wavelengths, light-emitting diodes using inorganic materials or organic EL devices are used.

(Analysis of Color Filters 1 to 11 by USAXS) Each of the color filters 1 to 11 was attached to a sample holder made of Al with an adhesive tape and then fixed to a light-transmissive sample stage. The sample was subjected to analysis by ultra-small angle X-ray scattering under the following conditions, and the analysis showed three particle size distributions; of these, particles having a distribution with an average particle size ranging from 1 to 40 nm were defined as primary particles, particles having a distribution with an average particle size ranging from 40 to 100 nm were defined as secondary particles, and particles having a distribution with an average particle size ranging from 100 to 1000 nm were defined as tertiary particles. Table 1 shows the results of the analysis. The total of the secondary particles and the tertiary particles were defined as higher-order particles and shown in Table 1. Analytical equipment and the analytical technique were as follows. Analytical Equipment: Large-scale synchrotron radiation facility: a beam line owned by Frontier Soft Matter Beamline Consortium in SPring-8: BL03XU, second hatch Analytical Mode: Ultra-small angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) Analytical conditions: wavelength of 0.1 nm, camera length of 6 m, beam spot size of 140 μm×80 μm, no attenuator, exposure time of 30 seconds, and 2θ=0.01 to 1.5° Analytical Software: Fit2D for imaging of two-dimensional data and for conversion into one-dimensional data (software obtained from the website of European Synchrotron Radiation Facility [http://www.esrf.eu/computing/scientific/FIT2D/]) The particle size distribution was analyzed with software NANO-Solver (Ver 3.6) commercially available from Rigaku Corporation.
