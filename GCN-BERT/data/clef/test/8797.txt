PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING ANTIBACTERIAL AGENTS RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to Indian Patent Application No. 1407/MUM/2014 filed on April 18, 2014 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety as if fully rewritten herein. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to antibacterial compositions and methods for treating or preventing bacterial infections. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Bacterial infections continue to remain one of the major causes contributing towards human diseases. One of the key challenges in treatment of bacterial infections is the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to one or more antibacterial agents over time. Examples of such bacteria that have developed resistance to typical antibacterial agents include: Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The problem of emerging drug-resistance in bacteria is often tackled by switching to newer antibacterial agents, which can be more expensive and sometimes more toxic. Additionally, this may not be a permanent solution as the bacteria often develop resistance to the newer antibacterial agents as well in due course. In general, bacteria are particularly efficient in developing resistance, because of their ability to multiply very rapidly and pass on the resistance genes as they replicate. The persistent exposure of bacterial strains to a multitude of beta-lactam antibacterial agents has led to overproduction and mutation of beta-lactamases. These new extended spectrum beta- lactamases (ESBL) are capable of hydrolyzing penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams and even carbapenems. Such a wide spread resistance to many of the existing beta-lactam antibacterial agents, either used alone or in combination with other agents, is posing challenges in treating serious bacterial infections. Therefore, there is a need for development of newer ways to treat infections that are becoming resistant to known therapies and methods. Surprisingly, it has been found that a compositions comprising aztreonam and certain nitrogen containing bicyclic compounds exhibit unexpectedly synergistic antibacterial activity, even against highly resistant bacterial strains. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, there are provided pharmaceutical compositions comprising: (a) aztreonam or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, and (b) a compound of Formula (I) or a stereoisomer or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof: NN ,S03M O Formula (I) wherein Q is: (a) cyano, five to fourteen membered heteroaryl, optionally substituted with one or more of the following: (i) -CO-NH2, (ii) five to fourteen membered heteroaryl, (iii) three to seven membered heterocycloalkyl, (iv) three to seven membered cycloalkyl, (v) five to fourteen membered aryl, or (vi) Ci-C6 alkyl, optionally substituted with -NH2 or three to seven membered heterocycloalkyl, CO-NH-O-R, ; Ri is (a) three to seven membered heterocycloalkyl, or (b) Ci-C6 alkyl, optionally substituted with three to seven membered heterocycloalkyl; M is a cation.

EXAMPLES The following examples illustrate the embodiments of the invention that are presently best known. However, it is to be understood that the following are only exemplary or illustrative of the application of the principles of the present invention. Numerous modifications and alternative compositions, methods, and systems may be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The appended claims are intended to cover such modifications and arrangements. Thus, while the present invention has been described above with particularity, the following examples provide further detail in connection with what are presently deemed to be the most practical and preferred embodiments of the invention. The synergistic killing effect of the combinations according to invention was studied by performing time kill studies. In a typical time kill study, the freshly grown cultures were diluted to the required cell density (initial starting inoculum) in Cation adjusted Muller Hinton broth medium (BD, USA). The antibacterial agents (either alone or in combination) at the required concentrations were added into the culture-containing medium. The samples were incubated under shaking condition (120 rpm) at 37 °C. Enumeration of viable bacterial count was done every 2 hour by diluting in normal saline and plating on to the Tryptic Soya Agar plates (BD, USA). The plates were incubated for 24 hours to arrive at the viable bacterial count. The results of these studies are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, wherein the antibacterial activity is expressed in terms of Log CFU (Colony Forming Units) per ml. In general, the decrease of 1 Log CFU/ml, corresponds to 90% killing of bacteria. Similarly, 2 Log CFU/ml reductions indicates to 99% killing of bacteria and 3 Log CFU/ml reductions is equal to 99.9% killing of bacteria. Ten compounds generally represented by a general Formula (I) were used and are as follows: (a) Sodium salt of ir ns-7-oxo-6-sulphooxy-l ,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]-octane-2-carbonitrile (Compound A); (b) trans-sulphuric acid mono-[2-(5-carboxamido)-[l ,3,4]-oxadiazol-2-yl)-7-oxo-l,6- diazabicyclo[3.2.1]-octan-6-yl] ester (Compound B); (c) trans-sulphuric acid mono-[2-(5-(piperidin-4-yl)-[l ,3,4]-oxadiazol-2-yl)-7-oxo-l,6- diazabicyclo[3.2.1]-octan-6-yl] ester (Compound C); (d) trans-sulphuric acid mono-[2-(5-azetidin-3-ylmethyl-[l ,3,4]-oxadiazol-2-yl)-7-oxo-l,6- diazabicyclo[3.2.1]-octan-6-yl] ester (Compound D); (e) (25,5i?)-7-Oxo-6-sulphooxy-2-[N'-((i?)-piperidine-3-carbonyl)-hydrazinocarbonyl] -1,6- diaza-bicyclo[3.2.1]octane (Compound E); (f) (25, 5i?)-7-Oxo-N-[(25)-pyrrolidin-2-ylmethoxy]-6-(sulfooxy)-l,6-diaza bicyclo [3.2.1] octane-2-carboxamide (Compound F); (g) (25,5i?)-7-Oxo-6-sulphooxy-2-[N'-((i?)-pyrrolidine-3-carbonyl)-hydrazinocarbonyl]-l ,6-diaza -bicyclo[3.2.1]octane (Compound G); (h) (25,5i?)-7-Oxo-N-[(25)-piperidine-2-ylmethyloxy]-6-(sulfooxy)-l ,6-diazabicyclo octane-2-carboxamide (Compound H); (i) trans-sulphuric acid mono-[2-(5-((5)-l-amino-ethyl)-[l ,3,4]-oxadiazol-2-yl)-7-oxo-l,6- diazabicyclo[3.2.1]-octan-6-yl] ester (Compound I); and j) trans-sulphuric acid mono-[2-(5-((5)-pyrrolidin-2-yl)-[l,3,4]-oxadiazol-2-yl)-7-oxo-l,6- diazabicyclo[3.2.1]-octan-6-yl] ester (Compound J). Table 1 details the antibacterial activity of the combination according to invention against highly resistant K. pneumoniae NCTC 13443 strain producing multiple beta-lactamases such as SHV, TEM and carbapenem hydrolyzing metallo beta-lactamases (NDM-1). The assay without any antibacterial agent was taken as control. As can be seen from the Table 1 ; aztreonam, compound A, compound B, compound C, compound D, compound E, compound F, compound G, compound H, compound I, compound J and imipenem when used alone at 4 μg/ml, were not effective to decrease the bacterial count of K. pneumoniae throughout the duration of the study. However, surprisingly it has been observed that the combination of aztreonam and a compound selected from compound A, compound B, compound C, compound D, compound E, compound F, compound G, compound H, compound I or compound J, exhibited synergistic killing against a resistant strain of K. pneumoniae. The data reveals that combination of aztreonam (at 4 mcg/ml), and a compound selected from compound A, compound B, compound C, compound D, compound E, compound F, compound G, compound H, compound I or compound J (at 4 mcg/ml) significantly reduced bacterial count throughout the duration of the study considering 8 hours killing. Table 2 details the antibacterial activity of the combination according to invention against highly resistant K. pneumoniae B 88 strain producing multiple beta-lactamases such as SHV, TEM, CTXM and carbapenem hydrolyzing metallo beta-lactamases (NDM-1). The assay without any antibacterial agent was taken as control. As can be seen from the Table 2; aztreonam, compound A, compound B, compound C, compound D, compound E, compound F, compound G, compound H, compound I, compound J and imipenem when used alone at 4 /η 1, were not effective to decrease the bacterial count of K. pneumoniae throughout the duration of the study. However, surprisingly it has been observed that the combination of aztreonam and a compound selected from compound A, compound B, compound C, compound D, compound E, compound F, compound G, compound H, compound I or compound J exhibited synergistic killing resistant strain of K. pneumoniae. The data reveals that for combination of aztreonam (at 4 mcg/ml) and a compound selected from compound A, compound B, compound C, compound D, compound E, compound F, compound G, compound H, compound I or compound J (at 4 mcg/ml) significantly reduced bacterial count throughout the duration of the study considering 8 hours killing. The results given in the Tables 1 and 2, clearly and surprisingly demonstrate the potent antibacterial activity for the combination of aztreonam and representative compounds of Formula (I) against highly resistant strains of K. pneumoniae. Aztreonam and all the representative compounds of Formula (I) compounds, when used alone, were found to be ineffective against these resistant bacterial strains. However, the combination of aztreonam and compound of Formula (I) exhibited unusual and unexpected synergistic antibacterial effect against highly resistant bacterial strains. Thus combination of aztreonam and the compound of Formula (I) have tremendous beneficial effect in inhibiting highly resistant bacterial strains demonstrating the noteworthy therapeutic advance in the treatment of infections caused by such pathogens.
