FIG. 2 is a sectional view of the cleaning element 300 shown in FIG. 1 through line 2— 2. FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the cleaning element 300 of FIG. 1 with a support 310. FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a cleaning tool 100 comprising the cleaning element 300 of FIG. 1. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, the cleaning tool 100 comprises a handle 200 with a holding end 205 and a working end 210. The working end 210 includes a first attachment 230 for connection with a second attachment 31 1 (discussed below) on the cleaning element 300. In one embodiment the handle 200 includes a receptacle 215 for holding a liquid, such as liquid dish soap. To aid in dispensing the dish soap from the receptacle 215 to the cleaning element 300, the handle includes a passage 217. In one embodiment, to prevent continuous leaking of the liquid contained within the receptacle, the handle may include a valve (not shown) at the passage 217 to hold the liquid in the handle until sufficient pressure is placed against the valve. The pressure may come from deformation of an actuator 220. In this embodiment, the actuator 220 is deformable and is located on the underside of the handle 200. Therefore, when the handle 200 is being held, a user's index finger is able to easily deform the actuator 220, which in turn, forces liquid from the valve out the passage 217. From the passage 217, the liquid will enter into the cleaning element 300. The cleaning element 300 may itself include through passages to further aid in the fast release of the dispensed liquid from the handle 200 to the surface being cleaned. The cleaning element 300 includes a cleaning material 305 with a working surface 330, a back surface 340, defining a perimeter 302, width 301, thickness 303, and volume. The cleaning element 300 includes a first portion 314 and a second portion 317 separated from one another by a pivot zone 320. The second portion 317 is able to rotate relative to the first portion 314 at the pivot zone 320. In one embodiment, the pivot zone 320 includes a pivot axis 322, which passes through the cleaning element 300 so that the second portion 317 is able to rotate relative to the first portion 314 about the pivot axis 322. The pivoting or rotation of the second portion 317 relative to the first portion 314 creates the continuously curving working surface 330. By continuously curving, it is meant that the cleaning material 305 at the working surface 330 does not have breaks or disconnects, other than those features naturally part of the underlying substrate. When the cleaning element 300 is of a completely uniform, solid material, pivoting a second portion relative to the first portion can apply large amounts of pressure and stress on the cleaning element 300 due to the compressed cleaning material at the pivot. Removing or reducing a portion of the cleaning material at the pivot, while keeping the working surface continuous, allows for reduced stress on the cleaning element. Therefore, the pivoted cleaning material remains in a pivoted position. In one embodiment, cleaning material 305 at the pivot zone 320 is removed. In one embodiment, the pivot zone 320 is a portion of the cleaning element 300 having a thickness less than the thickness of either the first or second portions 314, 317. In one embodiment, the pivot zone 320 is a portion of the cleaning element 300 having a volume less than the volume of either the first or second portions 314, 317. In one embodiment, the pivot zone 320 is a portion of the cleaning element 300 having a density that is less than the density of either the first or second portions 314, 317. In either embodiment, the cleaning material 305 at the working surface 330 remains continuous. The pivot zone 320 is created by removing a portion of the cleaning material 305. Creating the pivot zone 320 on the cleaning material 305 can be accomplished from a variety of known techniques to remove material depending on the type of cleaning material 305 and the desired configuration of the shape or arrangement of the removed material at the pivot zone 320. To remove cleaning material 305 to create the pivot zone 320, cleaning material 305 can be melted, compressed, dissolved, or mechanically cut. For example, techniques such as water jet cutting, notching, variable cross sectioning, laser cutting, routing, knife cutting, flame melting, chemical melting or fusing, band heating, or hot wire melting or cutting from application of heat could be used to form the pivot zone 320. One skilled in the art would be able to identify suitable techniques for the particular cleaning material 305. For example, melting is a suitable technique for forming the pivot zone for thermoplastic cleaning material, such as thermoplastic foams or nonwovens. There can be any number of arrangements for the specific arrangement of the pivot zone 320, i.e., the material removed from the cleaning material 305 to form the pivot zone 320. Generally, the material removed from the cleaning material 305 to create the pivot zone 320 is shaped to guide curving and pivoting of the second portion 317 relative to the first portion 314. To maintain the continuity and integrity of the working surface 330, the pivot zone 320 does not extend entirely through the thickness 303 of the cleaning material 305. There may be one or more defined portions removed from the cleaning material 305 to form the pivot zone 320. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3, the pivot zone 320 extends across the width 301 of the cleaning material 305, but near the perimeter 302 some cleaning material 305 remains. The thickness of the material removed at the perimeter 302 of the pivot zone 320 is less than the thickness of the material removed within the remaining portion of the pivot zone 320, which is less than the overall thickness 303 of the cleaning material 305. In other words, material removed at the pivot zone 320 is not uniform across the width 301 of the cleaning material 305. In this embodiment, when the second portion 317 is curved relative to the first portion 314, the cleaning material 305 at the perimeter 302 remains to provide a nearly continuous surface without substantial gaps or openings. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, the pivot zone 320 extends uniformly and entirely across the width 301 of the cleaning material 305. In one embodiment, not shown, the cleaning material removed to form the pivot zone 320 is entirely within the perimeter 302 of the cleaning material 305, such that at the perimeter 302 the full thickness 303 of the cleaning material 305 remains. In the specific embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-4, the cleaning material 305 is a thermoplastic, specifically a thermoplastic foam, and the pivot zone 320 is formed by melting the thermoplastic material to create a generally inward sloping surface at the pivot zone 320. The inward sloping surface at the pivot zone 320 creates a pull or pucker so that the second portion 317 naturally pivots relative to the first portion 314. The pivot zone 320 may include one or more linear, circular, or other shaped sections removed. In one embodiment, more than 10% of the thickness at the pivot zone is removed, in one embodiment, more than 25% of the thickness at the pivot zone is removed, and in one embodiment more than 50% of the thickness at the pivot zone is removed. In one embodiment, more than 5% of the thickness remains at the working surface, in one embodiment, more than 15% of the thickness remains at the working surface, in one embodiment, more than 25% of the thickness remains at the working surface. In one embodiment, the working surface 330 of cleaning material 305 continuously curves at least 45 degrees, as measured by an inside angle formed through the cleaning material 305 between the relative positions of the working surface 330. In one embodiment, the working surface 330 of cleaning material 305 continuously curves at least 90 degrees, as measured by an inside angle formed through the cleaning material 305 between the relative positions of the working surface 330. In one embodiment, the working surface 330 of cleaning material 305 continuously curves less than 180 degrees, as measured by an inside angle formed through the cleaning material 305 between the relative positions of the working surface 330.1n one embodiment, relative portions of the working surface 330 are parallel to one another, but spaced apart from one another by the cleaning material 305. It is understood that to create the disclosed continuously curving working surface 330, the second portion 317 of the cleaning material 305 rotates relative to the first portion 314 such that at the back surface 340 of the cleaning material 305 is at least partially under compression while the cleaning material 305 at the working surface 330 is at least partially under tension. The cleaning material 305 may have varying width 301 along its length. In one embodiment, as can best be seen in FIGS. 1 and 3, the cleaning material at the first portion 314 has a first width wider than the width at the second portion 317. Therefore, the width of the working surface 330 narrows at the pivot zone 320. Therefore, the working surface 330 at the pivot zone 320 is better able to fit into small, curving areas of items being clean, like the bottom of a glass or bowl. In one embodiment, the cleaning element 300, such as shown in FIG. 1, can be used alone as shown. The second portion 317 can flex and pivot at the pivot zone 320 relative to the first portion 314 to allow for cleaning of contoured surfaces. In one embodiment, the cleaning element 300 may be secured to a support 310. The support 310 maybe secured to one or both of the first and second portions 314, 317. The support 310 may be secured to a back surface 340 of the first portion 314, the second portion 317 pivoted and then secured either to the support 310 or to a portion of the back surface 340 of the first portion, such as shown in FIG. 3. The support maybe secured to both the first and second portions and would include a flexible portion at the pivot zone 320, such as a living hinge, or such as shown in US Patent Application Publication 2014-0013527, incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, the support 310 may be of a size or shape to allow a user to easily hold the cleaning element 300. In one embodiment, the support includes the second attachment 31 1 with a slot 312 for receiving the first attachment 230 of the handle 200. The second attachment 31 1 also includes a guard 313. The guard 313 is deformable so that is can be pressed down to allow for the first attachment 230 to slide in and out of the second attachment 31 1. When the guard 313 is in place, it securely wraps around the backside of the working end 210 of the handle 200 to provide a secure connection between the cleaning element 300 and handle 200. Depending on the materials of the support 310 or the cleaning material 305, one skilled in the art could use any number of materials or techniques for either securing the cleaning element 300 to the support or for securing the second portion 317 of the cleaning material 305 to either the support 310 or the first portion 314 to create the continuously curving working surface 330. For example, chemical or flame treatment of a meltable material, adhesives, or mechanical fasteners could be used. In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 3 a support 310 is secured to the back surface 340 of the first portion 314 of the cleaning material 305, while the second portion 317 is rotated about the pivot zone 320 and secured to a portion of the support 310. In another embodiment, a portion of a support is secured to the first portion 314 of the cleaning material 305 while a second portion of a support is secured to the second portion 317 of the cleaning material 305. The two parts of the support interact and may interlock such as described in US Patent Application Publication 2014-0013527. The cleaning material 305 can comprise foam, sponge, nonwoven fabric, knitted fabric, woven fabric, scouring material, such as scouring nonwoven webs or fabric coated or printed with abrasive or resin, or combinations of one or more thereof. In one embodiment, the cleaning material 305 is a foam or sponge, with a scouring layer secured to the foam or sponge at the outermost working surfaces. The cleaning material 305 can be secured to the support 310 by a variety of mechanisms such as adhesive or melt bonding. It is understood that the curved cleaning element 300 may be secured to a separate cleaning tool 100, which includes a handle, or may be independently used for cleaning. Further if used with a cleaning tool 100, any variety of sizes and shapes of cleaning tools could be used and any specific types of attachment mechanisms could be used for securing the cleaning element 300 to the cleaning tool 100. FIGS. 5 and 6 show an alternative embodiment, where similar reference numbers for similar features are used. As distinguished from the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-4, in this embodiment the pivot zone 320 includes a shaped section from edge-to-edge of the cleaning material 305. In the pivoted cleaning element 300 shown in FIG. 6, the second portion 317 is secured to the back surface 340 of the first portion 314. A support is not shown, but it is understood that a support such as described above could be included. In this embodiment, the working surface 330 is continuously curving. The cleaning element 300 can be made in a variety of methods disclosed. In one embodiment, the cleaning element 300 is made by providing a cleaning material 305 with back surface 340 and a working surface 330 that together define a volume and thickness 303. A portion of the cleaning material 305 is removed at a pivot zone 320. The pivot zone 320 separates the cleaning material 305 into a first portion 314 and second portion 317. At the pivot zone 320, the cleaning material 305 has less thickness and/or less volume as compared to either the first or second portions 314, 317. In one embodiment, the back surface 340 of the first portion 314 of the cleaning material 305 is attached to a support 310 and the second portion 317 of the cleaning material 305 is pivoted at the pivot zone. The second portion 317 of the cleaning material 305 is secured to the support 310 and/or the first portion 314 of the cleaning material 305 to form a continuously curving working surface 330 of the cleaning material 305. The disclosed curved cleaning element and method of making the cleaning element provide for a continuously curving working surface that is useful for cleaning flat and curved surfaces such as bowls or cups.
