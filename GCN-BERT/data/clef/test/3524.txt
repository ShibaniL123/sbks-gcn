6-(3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl)-4-methyl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-5,7-dione
Step 1
6-(3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl)-4-methyl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-5,7-dione
3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl methanesulfonate (30.0 mg, 0.118 mmol), 4-methyl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-5,7-dione (29.4 mg, 0.118 mmol), potassium carbonate (32.7 mg, 0.236 mmol) and potassium iodide (3.9 mg, 0.024 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (5 mL). The reaction was heated to 120Â°C and stirred for 3 hours. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, poured into water (20 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL x 3). The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated and purified by preparative HPLC to give 6-(3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl)-4-methyl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-5,7-dione (15.0 mg) with a yield of 31%.
