Field of the Invention The invention relates to novel fungal endoglucanases, their production and means for their production. The invention further relates to enzyme preparations comprising at least one novel endoglucanase as well as to processes for treating cellulosic material therewith. Still further the invention relates to detergent compositions and animal feed comprising the endoglucanases. Background of the Invention Cellulases are amongst the most widely used enzymes in industry. They are generally applied in textile industry, detergent industry, pulp and paper industry, feed and food industry, including baking and in hydrolysis of lignocellulosic material for, e.g., bioethanol production etc. The practical use of cellulases is hampered by the nature of the cellulase compositions, which often are enzyme mixtures having a variety of activities and substrate specificities. For this reason, efforts have been made to obtain cellulases having only the desired activities. The unique properties of each cellulase make some more suitable for certain purposes than others. In fabric treatment cellulases attack the chains of cellulose molecules that form the cotton fibers, thereby affecting the characteristics of the fabric. In textile industry a "stone washed" or abraded look has been denim producers' interest in recent years. Traditional stone washing with pumice stones reduces the strength of fabric and burdens the laundering apparatuses. The trend has been towards enzymatic denim finishing processes and cellulases have replaced or are being used together with pumice stones to give the fabric its desired "worn" look. Controlled enzyme treatments result in less damage to the garments and machines and eliminate the need for disposal of stones. Additionally, textile industry uses cellulases in biofinishing, i.e. to create permanent improvement of depilling, and to improve pilling resistance, clear surface structure by reduced fuzz, improve textile handle, such as softness, smoothness and a silkier feel, improve drapability and brighter colors of the textile and improve moisture absorbability. Cellulases comprise a catalytic domain/core (CD) expressing cellulase activity. In addition to the catalytic domain the cellulase molecule may comprise one or more cellulose binding domains (CBDs), also named as carbohydrate binding domains/modules (CBD/CBM), which can be located either at the N- or C-terminus of the catalytic domain. CBDs have carbohydrate-binding activity and they facilitate the enzymatic action on solid substrates. The catalytic core and the CBD are typically connected via a flexible and highly glycosylated linker region. Cellulases that attack primarily on the surface of the fiber are especially useful in stone washing of denim dyed with Indigo dye, as the dye is located on the surface of the fiber. Cellulases applied in denim treatment are usually divided into two main groups: acid and neutral cellulases. Acid cellulases typically operate at pH 4.0-5.5 and the neutral cellulases in the range of pH 6-8. Acid cellulases are especially used in biofinishing (depilling) and also in denim treatment (biostoning) while neutral celluases are typically used in denim applications. Endoglucanases (EGs) are one of the three types of cellulases generally needed for the biological conversion of cellulose to glucose. Some naturally occurring endoglucanases have a cellulose-binding domain (CBD), while others do not. Endoglucanases are widely used in textile, detergent, bioethanol and pulp and paper industry. Cellulases including endoglucanases may be classified into various glycosyl hydrolase families according their primary sequence, supported by analysis of the three dimensional structure of some members of the family (Henrissat 1991, Henrissat and Bairoch 1993, 1996). For example glycosyl hydrolase families 5, 7, 12 and 45 contain endoglucanases. Most of the acid textile cellulases belong to family 5, whereas most of the neutral textile cellulases are of family 12 or 45. The wide spectrum of industrial uses for endoglucanases has established a need for commercial endoglucanase products showing desired performance at desired conditions such as pH and temperature ranges. The majority of the industrially used enzymes work better at elevated temperatures, usually about >50°C, but for energy saving reasons, better color fastness and reduction of shrinkage of garments there is a need for enzymes with good performance at lower temperature levels i.e. <50°C, for example about 30 to 40°C, or even 20 to 40°C. Such cold active enzymes have been described e.g. in bacteria, especially in Bacillus. However, production of bacterial enzymes for industrial applications is complicated and laborious compared to the production of fungal enzymes. Still there is very little knowledge about possible cold active fungal endoglucanases. To our knowledge no cold acting endoglucanase of family 45 has been described so far. An endoglucanase of the Cel45 family is disclosed in US 5,610,129, which describes dye transfer inhibiting compositions containing a Humicola insolens kd43 cellulase. Its thermal properties are not disclosed. Gibberella zeae Cel45 enzymes have not been proposed to be used in textile finishing. US 7,256,032 describes Cel45 cellulases having good performance in textile finishing. Performance in denim finishing is optimal at 60°C, and the lowest temperature measured is 40°C with less than 50% of the optimal activity. US2005/070003 describes cellulase preparations performing well e.g. in laundry compositions, biopolishing newly manufactured textiles and providing an abraded look for cellulosic fabric. None of the enzymes described shows an advantageous performance at low temperatures. Thus there is a continuous need for new and advantageous cellulases having desired properties and thermal profiles. The present invention meets this need. Shimonaka et al. (BIOSCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY, vol. 70, no. 4, April 2006 (2006-04), p. 1013-1016), discloses several family 45 endoglucanases (i.a. MCE1 and MCE2) having lower optimum temperatures than those of other family 45 endoglucanases. The utility in laundry processes is also disclosed. Brief Description of the Invention The present invention now provides novel endoglucanases of the cel45 family, with a unique thermal profile shown by having good performance also at low temperatures. The unique thermal properties mean that no remarkable decrease in performance can be seen when the temperature is below 50°C e.g. about 40°C, about 30°C or even about 20°C. The endoglucanases are useful in different cellulase applications such as fabric treatment, especially denim treatment and depilling. Contrary to previously described depilling enzymes, which generally are acid cellulases, the novel endoglucanases perform well also at relatively neutral pH. This enables biofinishing treatment simultaneously with dyeing, leading to considerable savings. Also the color fastness is often better at neutral conditions. The present invention provides a fungal endoglucanase polypeptide, which belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 45, and which shows substantial performance at low temperatures. The invention further provides an en-zyme preparation comprising said endoglucanase, and detergent compositions and animal feed comprising said enzyme or enzyme preparation. In particular the invention is directed to endoglucanases that comprise an amino acid sequence having at least 65% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 13, at least 90% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 17 or at least 90% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 19. The invention is further directed to an isolated polynucleotide selected from the group consisting of: a) a nucleotide sequence having SEQ ID NO: 12, 16, or 18, or a sequence encoding the endoglucanase polypeptide described above,b) a complementary strand of a) orc) a sequence that is degenerate as a result of the genetic code to anyone of the sequences of a) or b). The invention is still further directed to an expression vector comprising said polynucleotide, a host cell comprising said expression vector, and an E. coli strain having accession number DSM 18916, DSM 19173 or DSM 18915. Still further the invention provides a method for the production of the endoglucanase polypeptide, comprising the steps of transforming a host cell with an expression vector encoding said polypeptide, and culturing said host cell under conditions enabling expression of said polypeptide, and optionally recovering and purifying said polypeptide. Finally the invention provides a process for treating cellulosic material, wherein said process comprises contacting the cellulosic material with the endoglucanase polypeptide or enzyme preparation of the invention. Specific embodiments of the invention are set forth in the dependent claims. Other objects, details and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following drawings, detailed description and examples. It should be understood, however, that the embodiments given in the description, drawings and in the examples are for illustrative purposes only, and that various changes and modifications are possible within the scope of the claims.

Figure 5 shows the performance of Gp_RF6293_Cel45 in biofinishing (defuzzing) treatment at 40°C compared to control sample without enzyme. Detailed Description of the Invention The invention is based on studies, where a fungal culture collection was screened for low-temperature cellulolytic activity. Fungal strains were cultivated at 20°C for 3-7 days using various production media. Supernatants were recovered and cellulolytic activity against carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and hydroxyethylcellulase (HEC) at temperatures 30°C and 50°C was tested to screen low temperature profiles. The most favorable strains were further tested in small-scale biostoning applications after cultivation at 20°C for 4-7 days. After preliminary screening four strains were selected for construction of genomic libraries, and the libraries were further screened for cel45 genes with probes amplified using degenerate primers. Positive phage clones were subcloned to bacterial vectors and confirmed by sequencing before deposition at DSMZ. For production of the Cel45 enzymes the genes encoding desired activities were fused to Trichoderma reesei cbh1/cel7A promoter. Transcription termination was ensured by a T. reesei cbh1/cel7A terminator, and an amdS marker was used for screening positive clones. Linear expression cassettes were isolated from the vector backbone and transformed into T. reesei protoplasts having major cellulases deleted. Purified transformants were cultured for 7 days in cellulase inducing media and endoglucanase activity was tested from the culture supernatant. Thermal and pH properties were also tested. Material for large-scale application was obtained by laboratory bioreactor cultivations at 28°C lasting for 3-4 days followed by filtration and concentration when needed. Culture supernatants were tested in denim treatment in different temperatures using two commercial cel45 preparations as references in a washing machine. The resulting biostoning effect was evaluated using color reflectance measurement. Surprisingly it was found that temperature profiles measured in application were different from those received in primary characterization in test tubes. In addition pH properties of the samples were tested in denim application. Further, the depilling/defuzzing effect on yarn cotton fleece was tested in a washing machine with different dosages of enzyme and compared to a prior art sample. Surprisingly at low temperature fuzz-free surface was obtained using a lower dosage than what could be expected based on tests in denim treatment. The present invention provides novel fungal endoglucanase polypeptides of glycosyl hydrolase family 45 with substantial performance at low temperatures. Polypeptide and protein as used herein are synonyms. "Fungal" in this context means that the endoglucanase or the polynucleotide encoding it may be derived from a fungus, and especially from a filamentous fungus, such as Geomyces or Fusarium. According to a specific embodiment of the invention the endoglucanase is derived from G. pannorum or F. cf equiseti, most preferably from G. pannorum RF 6293 (CBS 119567), F. cf. equiseti RF6318 (CBS 119568), G. pannorum RF6546 (CBS 119958), or G. pannorum RF6608 (CBS 119962). The term "derived from" in connection with a microorganism source means that the polypeptide may naturally be produced by said specific microorganism source, or the polynucleotide encoding the polypeptide may be isolated from said microorganism source, and optionally expressed in a host cell into which the polynucleotide or a synthetized version thereof, possibly using alternative codons, from said microorganism source encoding the polypeptide has been introduced. However, it does not exclude minor modifications of the sequence e.g. by substitution, deletion, and/or insertion of one or a few amino acids/nucleotides as long as the enzymatic activity of the encoded and secreted protein is retained. "Endoglucanase" ("EG") in connection with the present invention refers to enzymes classified as E.C. 3.2.1.4. They are 1,4-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolases and catalyze endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-glycosidic linkages in polymers of glucose such as cellulose. Some endoglucanases may also hydrolyse e.g. 1,4-linkages in beta-D-glucans also containing 1,3-linkages. They may therefore also be classified as endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanases (E.C. 3.2.1.6). Thus, an enzyme may catalyze reactions on several substrates and can belong to multiple classes. The endoglucanases of the invention may optionally contain a signal sequence, and one or more cellulose binding domains (CBDs) linked to the catalytic domain/core (CD). "Glycosyl hydrolase family 45" refers to the glycosyl hydrolase family as defined by Henrissat 1991, and Henrissat and Bairoch 1993, 1996, which are incorporated herein by reference. The gene encoding family 45 cellulase is called cel45 and the encoded protein is called Cel45. The endoglucanases of the invention show substantial performance at low temperature. "Substantial performance" in this context means that the enzymes show excellent performance when applied in at least one type of cellulase application process such as e.g. biostoning and/or biofinishing of textiles, or in washing. The unique temperature profiles of the novel endoglucanases may be illustrated by their "30:50 ratio" in denim application, which indicates relative performance (%) at 30°C compared to 50°C. Preferably the 30:50 ratio is at least 72%, more preferably at least 80%, and most preferably at least 90% or 95%. Alternatively the temperature profile may be illustrated by a "40:OT" ratio, which means relative performance (%) at 40°C compared to optimal temperature. Preferably the 40:OT ratio is at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, and most preferably at least 95%. "Cold active" or "low temperature" as used herein refers to a temperature of ≤50°C, especially ≤45°C, preferably ≤40°C, including ≤30°C. According to one embodiment of the invention, the endoglucanase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 65% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 13, at least 48% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 15, at least 87% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 17, at least 62% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 19, at least 59% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 21 or at least 49% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 23, or an enzymatically active fragment thereof. Preferably the endoglucanase comprises an amino acid sequence having at least 90%, preferably at least 95% and most preferably at least 98% or 99% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 or 23, or an enzymatically active fragment thereof. As used in the present context the term "identity" refers to the global identity between two amino acid sequences compared to each other from the first amino acid encoded by the corresponding gene to the last amino acid. For the purposes of the present invention identity is preferably determined by means of known computer programmes using standard algorithms. An example of such a programme is Clone Manager Suite, a programme that includes the programme part Align Part and is sold by Scientific & Educational Software, Durham, NC, USA. According to present invention, the programme version "Clone Manager 7 Align Plus 5" including the functions "Compare Two Sequences/Global/Compare DNA sequences" was especially used for determining the degree of identity. In this case algorithms available from the following sources were used: Hirschberg, D.S. (1975) A linear space algorithm for computing longest common subsequences, Commun. Assoc. Comput. Mach. 18: 341-343; Myers, E.W. and W. Miller. (1988) Optimal alignments in linear space, CABIOS 4:1, 11-17; Chao, K-M, W.R. Pearson and W. Miller. (1992) Aligning two sequences within a specified diagonal band, CA-BIOS 8:5, 481-487.The man skilled in the art is aware of the fact that results are comparative only when aligning corresponding domains of the sequence. Consequently comparison of e.g. cellulase sequences including CBD or signal sequences with sequences lacking those elements are excluded as not being meaningful. "Enzymatically active fragment" refers to part of a specific amino acid sequence that is long enough to have the desired enzymatic activity. In other words a fragment may be e.g. only the mature part of the polypeptide or even a subsequence of the mature part. It may or may not contain a linker and CBD domain. More specifically enzymatic activity refers to cellulase activity that has catalytic ability to hydrolyse cellulose or derivatives thereof, such as endoglucanase or beta-glucanase activity. In addition to endoglucanase and/or beta-glucanase activity, some of the cellulases may further have hemicellulase and/or xylanase activity. The enzymatic activity may be determined as described in Example 1. The polynucleotides of the invention may be either DNA or RNA. According to one embodiment of the invention the endoglucanases are encoded by a polynucleotide having SEQ ID NO: 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 or 22, or a fragment thereof long enough to encode an enzymatically active endoglucanase. Preferably the endoglucanases are encoded by a polynucleotide similar to that carried by E. coli DSM 18916, DSM 19171, DSM 19173, DSM 18915, DSM 18917, or DSM 19170. The endoglucanases of the invention are preferably recombinant proteins. They are conveniently prepared by generally known recombinant DNA technology in a heterologous or homologous host. Preferably the endoglucanase is overexpressed in a fungal host. Briefly the polynucleotide encoding the endoglucanase is cloned and inserted into an expression vector, transformed into a host cell and expressed. An "expression vector" is a cloning plasmid or vector capable of expressing DNA encoding the endoglucanase proteins after transformation into a desired host. When a fungal host is used, the gene of interest is preferably provided to a fungal host as part of a cloning or expression vehicle that integrates into the fungal chromosome, or allows the gene of interest to integrate into the host chromosome. Other sequences that are part of the cloning vehicle or expression vehicle may also be integrated with said DNA during the integration process. In addition, in fungi the expression vector or parts thereof can be targeted into predetermined loci. Alternatively, the desired gene can be provided as an autonomously replicating plasmid. The DNA encoding the endoglucanase proteins is preferably placed under the control of (i.e., operably linked to) certain control sequences such as promoter sequences provided by the vector. Upon transformation these control sequences integrate into the host genome with the gene of interest. Alternatively, the control sequences can be those at the integration site. The expression control sequences of an expression vector will vary depending on whether the vector is designed to express a certain gene in a prokaryotic or in a eukaryotic host. Expression control sequences can contain transcriptional regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancer elements, and transcriptional termination sequences, and/or translational regulatory elements, such as translational initiation and termination sites. A polynucleotide molecule, such as DNA, is said to be capable of expressing a polypeptide, if it contains expression control sequences, which contain transcriptional regulatory information and such sequences are operably linked to the nucleotide sequence, which encodes the polypeptide. An operable linkage is a linkage in which a sequence is connected to a regulatory sequence (or sequences) in such a way as to place expression of the sequence under the influence or control of the regulatory sequence. Two DNA sequences (such as a promoter region sequence linked to the 5' end of the protein encoding sequence) are said to be operably linked if function of the promoter results in transcription. The vectors of the invention may further comprise other operably linked regulatory elements, such as enhancer sequences. In a preferred embodiment, genetically stable transformants are constructed, whereby the DNA encoding the proteins is integrated into the host chromosome by transformation with a vector, which may harbor sequences promoting integration of said vector into the chromosome. Cells that have stably integrated DNA encoding the endoglucanase proteins into their chromosomes may be selected e.g. by introduced marker(s), homologous or heterologous, which allow for selection of host cells which contain the expression vector in the chromosome, for example the marker may provide biocide resistance, e.g., resistance to antibiotics, or heavy metals, such as copper, or markers complementing an auxotrophic mutation in the host chromosome, and the like. The selectable marker can for example be a selection gene directly linked to the DNA gene sequences to be expressed, or introduced into the same cell by co-transformation. Also other selection systems can be used. Once the expression vector containing the DNA encoding the endoglucanase is prepared, it is introduced into an appropriate host cell by any of a variety of suitable means, including transformation as known in the art. After transformation, recipient cells are usually grown in an appropriate selective medium, which selects for the growth of transformed cells. Suitable expression and production host systems are for example the production system developed for fungal hosts Trichoderma (EP 244 234), or Aspergillus, such as A. oryzae or A. niger (WO 97/08325 and WO 95/33386, U.S. Patent No. 5,843,745, U.S. Patent No. 5,770,418), or the production system developed for Fusarium, such as F. oxysporum (Malardier et al., 1989) or Chrysosporium lucknowense. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention partially cellulase and/or hemicellulase and/or protease deficient host strains can be used. Suitable production systems developed for bacteria include a production system developed for Bacillus, for example B. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. amyloliquefaciens or for E. coli, or for an actinomycete Streptomyces. Suitable production systems developed for yeasts are systems developed for Saccharomyces, Shizosaccharomyces, Pichia pastoris or Hansenula. Production systems in other microbes including consolidated fermentative microbes for bioethanol production or in mammalian cells or in plants are also possible. Expression of the cloned gene sequence(s) results in the production of the desired protein, or in the production of a fragment of this protein. This expression can take place in a continuous manner in the transformed cells, or in a controlled manner. To obtain the enzyme preparations of the invention, the hosts having the desired properties (that is, hosts capable of expressing economically feasible quantities of the endoglucanase proteins) are cultivated under suitable conditions, and the desired enzymes are preferably secreted from the hosts into the culture medium, and optionally recovered from said culture medium by methods known in the art. Preferably the host for such production is a filamentous fungus, such as Trichoderma orAspergillus, and especially T. reesei. As used in the present context the "enzyme preparation" refers to any enzyme product, which contains at least one of the novel endoglucanases described herein. Thus, such an enzyme preparation may be a spent culture medium or filtrate. Spent culture medium means the culture medium of the host comprising the produced enzymes. Preferably the host cells are separated from said medium after the production. If desired, such preparations may be lyophilized or the enzymatic activity otherwise concentrated and/or stabilized for storage. If required, a desired enzyme may be isolated and further purified in accordance with conventional methods, such as filtration, extraction, precipitation, chromatography, affinity chromatography, electrophoresis, or the like. However, it is an advantage of the invention that the culture medium with or without host cells may be utilized as an enzyme preparation as such without further purification, because the endoglucanase proteins can be secreted into the culture medium, and they display activity in the ambient conditions of the spent culture medium. The enzyme preparations are very economical to provide and use, because isolation of a specific enzyme from the culture medium is unnecessary. In addition to one or more endoglucanase proteins, the enzyme preparations may comprise one or more other enzymes, which may be for example other cellulases, amylases, lipases, proteases, hemicellulases, xylanases, pectinases and/or oxidases such as laccases, peroxidases and catalases. Alternatively, before, during or after the treatment with the endoglucanase protein another enzyme treatment may be carried out. The enzyme treatment may comprise, for example, one or more amylase treatments (e.g. for desizing of denim), one or more cellulase treatments and/or one or more peroxidase and/or laccase treatments. It depends on the application what other enzymes are included in the enzyme preparation or used in the enzyme treatment. In addition to the endoglucanase protein, the enzyme preparation may contain additives, such as stabilizers, buffers, preservatives, surfactants and/or culture medium components. Preferred additives are such, which are commonly used in enzyme preparations intended for the application, where the enzyme preparation is used. The enzyme preparations may be provided as a liquid or as a solid, for example, as a dried powder or granular, especially non-dusting granules, or a stabilized liquid. It is envisioned that the enzyme preparations can be further enriched to satisfy the requirements of a specific utility in various applications e.g. in the textile industry. A mixture of enzyme activities secreted by a host can be advantageous in a particular industrial application, for example in biofinishing and biostoning. The endoglucanase proteins and the preparations thereof are useful e.g. in textile, feed and food, e.g. baking applications, in biomass hydrolysis, e.g. in bioethanol production, and in plant oil, detergent, and pulp and paper industry. They may be used for treating any cellulosic material, such as textile material, plants or material of plant origin used in food or animal feed, plant material for oil extraction, or wood-derived mechanical or chemical pulp or secondary fiber. They may also be added into detergents e.g. to improve fabric care properties by antipilling, antigreying, color clarification and softening, ant to improve the textile cleaning effect, for instance soil removal. The detergent compositions further normally contain auxiliaries, such as surface active agents (anionic, non-ionic, cationic and ampholytic surfactants), builders and other optional ingredients such as anti-redeposition and soil suspension agents, optical brighteners, bleaching agents, dyes and pigments and hydrolases. In the present context "cellulosic material" refers to any material comprising cellulose or derivatives thereof as a significant component. The cellulosic material is contacted with an effective amount of the protein under suitable conditions, such as appropriate pH, and temperature, and the reaction is allowed to continue for a time sufficient for the enzymatic reaction to take place. The described endoglucanases are preferably used at a temperature range of about 20-50°C, and more preferably about 30-50°C. Useful temperatures are ≤50°C, for example ≤45°C, or in some cases ≤40°C, or even ≤30°C. A suitable pH range is about 3-9, preferably about 4-8, and especially about 5-6.5. The endoglucanases are especially useful in the treatment of textile materials, such as fabrics and garments or yarn. The textile material may be manufactured of natural cellulose containing fibers or man-made cellulose containing fibers or mixtures thereof, or a blend of synthetic fibers and cellulose containing fibers. Preferably the cellulose containing material is cotton, especially denim. By "denim" is meant, in connection of this invention, denim fabric, usually denim garments, particularly jeans. Advantageously the denim is Indigo dyed denim. Denim can also be treated with derivatives of Indigo or with Indigo together with some other dye, for example Indigo-dyed denim with sulphur bottom. The described endoglucanases are especially useful in textile industry preferably in biostoning and biofinishing. Stone washing has three steps: desizing, abrasion and after-treatment. The first step, the desizing process is normally the first wet treatment of jeans and means removal of starch or other sizing agents usually applied to the warp yarns to prevent damage during the weaving process. Alpha-amylases are used to remove starch-based sizing agents for improved and uniform wet processing. After desizing the jeans are normally rinsed with water or passed directly to the abrasion step. The second step, abrasion, can be performed with enzymes or pumice stones or both. In all cases mechanical action is needed to remove the dye, and the treatment is usually carried out in washing machines, like drum washers. The term "abraded" means the appearance of denim fabric, when it has been treated by cellulase enzymes or stones, or both. Synonymous expressions are "stone washed look" or "worn look". As a result of uneven dye removal there are contrasts between dyed areas and areas from which dye has been removed. Abrasion is generally followed by the third step, after-treatment that includes washing and rinsing steps during which detergents, optical brighteners, bleaching agents or softeners may be used. After the enzymatic treatment the reaction should be stopped in order to prevent damage of the treated materials, for example by temperature and/or pH inactivation, the latter comprising a thorough rinsing and/or detergent wash-off. This ensures that the mechanical strength of the fiber is not further compromised by the continued presence of the enzyme. As used in the present context the expression "biostoning" of fabric or garment means the use of enzymes in place of, or in addition to, pumice stones for the treatment of fabric or garment, especially denim. As stated above, treatment with cellulase can completely replace treatment with pumice stones. However, cellulase treatment can also be combined with pumice stone treatment, when it is desired to produce a heavily abraded finish. Further, the endoglucanases are useful in biofinishing of fabrics and garments. "Biofinishing" (also called depilling, defuzzing, dehairing or biopolishing) refers to the use of enzymes in a controlled hydrolysis of cellulosic fibers in order to modify the fabric or yarn surface in a manner that permanently prevents tendency for pilling, improves fabric handle like softness and smoothness, clears the surface structure by reducing fuzzing, which results in clarification of colors and may also improve the drapability, moisture absorbency and the dyeability of the fabric. Additional uses include the use in detergent compositions to improve fabric care properties by antipilling, antigraying, color clarification and softening, and to improve textile-cleaning effect, for instance soil removal. Enzymatic depilling can be carried out at any stage during textile wet processing, preferably after optional desizing and/or bleaching, and similar conditions as in biostoning can be used. Also textiles in garment form can be treated. The liquor ratio (the ratio of the volume of liquid per weight of fabric) in both biostoning and biofinishing may range from about 3:1 to 20:1, preferably 5:1 to 10:1. The treatment time can range between 15 min to 90 min and preferably 30 min to 60 min. It should be emphasized that the enzyme dosage greatly depends on the type of the fabrics, machinery, process conditions (pH, temperature, liquor ratio, treatment time, denim load, process scale) and type of enzyme preparation and like. A person skilled in art is capable in defining suitable dosages and conditions. The process of the invention for treating cellulosic material also encompasses hydrolysis of lignocellulosic material for e.g. bioethanol production. One example of use of consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) in hydrolysis of lignocellulosic material is described e.g. by van Zyl et al. in Adv Biochem Eng Biotechnol. 2007;108:205-35. The invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples. Example 1. Screening for strains expressing low-temperature cellulolytic activity About 180 fungal strains in the Roal Oy culture collection were tested for their ability to produce low-temperature cellulolytic activity. The fungal strains were cultivated in 100 ml volume on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at temperature of 20°C for 3-7 d. Several production media were tested containing Solka Floc cellulose as a carbon source. After the cultivation the cells and other solids were collected by centrifugation and the supernatant was recovered. If not used immediately, the preparation was stored in aliquots at -20°C. For the estimation of the enzyme activity at lower temperatures, assays were performed of the shake flask cultivation preparation at 30°C and 50°C for 1 h. All shake flask supernatants were assayed for the following activities: The endoglucanase (CMCase) activity: This was assayed with 3% (w/v) carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) as the substrate in 50 mM citrate buffer essentially as described by Bailey and Nevalainen 1981; Haakana et al., 2004. Reducing sugars were measured with the DNS reagent. The assay was performed both at pH 5.0 and 7.0. The endoglucanase (HEC) activity: This was assayed with 1% (w/v) hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) as the substrate in 50 mM citrate buffer essentially as described by Bailey and Nevalainen 1981. Reducing sugars were measured with the DNS reagent. The assay was performed both at pH 5.0 and 7.0. Culture supernatant preparations of the strains were tested in small scale biostoning application in an LP-2 Launder Ometer as follows. About 7.2 g of desized denim swatches (12x12 cm) were loaded with steel balls into 1.2 liter containers containing 100 ml Mc Ilvaine's buffer and 100 ml culture supernatant, and the Launder Ometer was run at 30°C for 120 min. After alkaline and detergent wash, the fabric samples were rinsed carefully with warm water and air dried. The results were evaluated both visually and by measuring the colour as reflectance values (data not shown). After preliminary screening, four strains (Geomyces pannorum RF6293, RF6546 and RF6608, and Fusarium cf. equiseti RF6318) were chosen for additional application studies. For that purpose the strains RF6546 and RF6608 were cultivated in 200 ml volume on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at a temperature of 20°C for 4-7 d in a medium, which contains g/litre: Solka Floc cellulose 10.0, corn steep powder 1.5, soybean meal 0.5, CaCO3 0.5, (NH4)2HPO4 1.5, KH2PO4 2.0, MgSO4·H2O 0.5, NaCl 0.5, NH4NO3 0.5, Tween-80 0.5, trace element solution #1 0.5, trace element solution #2 0.5, paraffin oil 0.5; the pH was adjusted to 6.4. Trace element solution #1 (mg/litre): MnSO4 1.6, ZnSO4·H2O 3.45, CoCl2·H2O 2.0; Trace element solution #2 (mg/litre): FeSO4·H2O 5.0. The strains RF6293 and RF6318 were cultivated in 200 ml volume on a rotary shaker (200 rpm) at a temperature of 20°C for 4-6 d in a medium, which contains g/litre: Solka Floc cellulose 30.0, corn steep powder 9.0, soybean meal 1.5, CaCO3 1.5, (NH4)2HPO4 4.5, KH2PO4 6.0, MgSO4·H2O 1.5, NaCl 0.5, NH4NO3 1.5, Tween-80 0.5, trace element solution #1 0.5, trace element solution #2 0.5, paraffin oil 0.5; the pH was adjusted to 6.4.

Cloning of the endoglucanase genes from Geomyces pannorum RF6293, RF6546, RF6608, and Fusarium cf. equiseti RF6318 Standard molecular biology methods were used in the isolation and enzyme treatments of DNA (plasmids, DNA fragments), in E. coli transformations, etc. The basic methods used are described in the standard molecular biology handbooks, e.g. Sambrook et al. (1989) and Sambrook and Russell (2001). Lambda DASH®II/BamHI vector (Stratagene, USA) was used in the construction of the genomic libraries for Geomyces pannorum RF6293, RF6546, Ref6608, and Fusarium cf. equiseti RF6318 according to the instructions from the supplier. The chromosomal DNAs, isolated by the method of Raeder and Broda (1985), were partially digested with Sau3A. The digested DNAs were size-fractionated and the fragments of the chosen size (5-20 kb) were ligated to the BamHI digested lambda vector arms. The ligation mixtures were packaged using Gigapack III Gold packaging extracts according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, USA). The titers of the constructed genomic libraries are presented in Table 1. Table 1.

The sequences of the heterologous primers were based on the conserved endoglucanase sequences (Table 2, SEQ ID NO: 1-5). The conserved sequences were identified by aligning the previously published amino acid sequences of Humicola grisea var. thermoidea AB003107, Fusarium oxysporum L29381, Melanocarpus albomyces AJ515703 and Gibberella zeae AY342397. The PCR reaction mixtures contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mM KCI, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM dNTPs, 1 µM each primer and 1-2 units of Dynazyme II DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland) and 0.5-1 µg of the genomic DNA. The conditions for the PCR reactions were the following: 5 min initial denaturation at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 30 s annealing at 52.5°C (±7.5°C gradient), 1 min extension at 72°C and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The genomic DNA templates used in the PCR reactions are listed in Table 3. Table 2.

DNA products having the expected sizes (estimated from the published endoglucanase sequences) were obtained from several reactions. The DNA fragments of the expected sizes were isolated from the most specific PCR reactions and they were cloned to pCR® 4-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen, USA). The inserts were characterized by sequencing and by performing Southern blot hybridizations to the genomic DNAs digested with several restriction enzymes. The PCR fragments, which were chosen to be used as probes for screening of the Geomyces pannorum RF6293, RF6546, RF6608, and Fusarium cf. equiseti RF6318 genomic libraries are presented in Table 3.

The inserts from the plasmids listed in Table 3 were labeled with digoxigenin according to the supplier's instructions (Roche, Germany). The amplified genomic libraries (1x105-6x105 plaques) were screened with labeled probe fragments. The hybridization temperature for the filters was 68°C and the filters were washed 2x5 min at RT using 2xSSC-0.1% SDS followed by 2x15 min at 68°C using 0.1xSSC-0.1% SDS. Several positive plaques were obtained from each of the hybridizations. Five strongly hybridizing plaques were purified from each screening. The phage DNAs were isolated and characterized by Southern blot hybridizations. The chosen restriction fragments hybridizing to the probe were subcloned to pBluescript II KS+ vector and the relevant regions of the clones were sequenced. In total, six cel45 genes were cloned; one from Geomyces pannorum RF6546 and Fusarium cf. equiseti RF6318 strains, and two cel45 genes from Geomyces pannorum strains, RF6293 and RF6608. Table 4 summarizes the information on the probes used for screening the genes, the phage clones from which the genes were isolated, the chosen restriction fragments containing the full-length genes with their promoter and terminator regions, the plasmid names, and the the DSM deposit numbers for the E. coli strains carrying these plasmids.

Production of recombinant Cel45 proteins in Trichoderma reesei Expression plasmids were constructed for overexpression of recombinant Cel45 proteins from Geomyces pannorum RF6293 and RF6546, and Fusarium cf. equiseti RF6318 in Trichoderma reesei. The expression plasmids constructed are listed in Table 10. The recombinant cel45 genes, including their own signal sequences, were exactly fused to the T. reesei cbh1/cel7A promoter (p cbh1). The transcription termination was ensured by the T. reesei cbh1/cel7A terminator (t cbh1) and the A. nidulans amdS marker gene was used for selection of the transformants as described in Paloheimo et al. (2003). The linear expression cassettes (Fig. 1) were isolated from the vector backbones after NotI digestion and were transformed into T. reesei A47 and/or A51 protoplasts (both strains has the genes encoding the four major cellulases CBHI/Cel7A, CBHII/Cel6A, EGI/Cel7B and EGII/Cel5A deleted). The transformations were performed as in Penttilä et al. (1987) with the modifications described in Karhunen et al. (1993), selecting acetamide as a sole nitrogen source (amdS marker gene). The transformants were purified on selection plates through single conidia prior to sporulating them on PD. Table 10.

The restriction site at the 3'-end of the genomic gene fragment that was used in the construction of the expression cassette is indicated in parenthesis. The endoglucanase production of the transformants was analysed from the culture supernatants of the shake flask cultivations (50 ml). The transformants were grown for 7 days in a complex lactose-based cellulase-inducing medium (Joutsjoki et al. 1993) buffered with 5% KH2PO4. The endoglucanase activity was assayed with 3% (w/v) carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) as the substrate in 50 mM citrate buffer according to Bailey and Nevalainen 1981 and Haakana et al., 2004. The genotypes of the chosen transformants were confirmed by using Southern blots in which several genomic digests were included and the respective expression cassette was used as a probe. Heterologous production of recombinant endoglunase proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with subsequent Coomassive staining. The recombinant Cel45A enzyme preparations were characterized in terms of pH optimum and thermal stability. The pH optima of the overproduced Cel45A proteins were determined in universal Mcllvaine buffer within a pH range of 4.0-8.0 using 3% (w/v) carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) as substrate (Fig. 2A). Thermal stability of the recombinant endoglucanase proteins was determined by measuring the CMCase activity in universal Mcllvaine buffer at the optimum pH with a reaction time of 1 h (Fig. 2B). The chosen endoglucanase producing transformants were cultivated in lab bioreactors at 28°C in the medium indicated above for 3-4 days with pH control 4.4 ± 0.2 (NH3/H3PO4) to obtain material for the application tests. The supernatants were recovered by centrifugation and filtering through Seitz-K 150 and EK filters (Pall SeitzSchenk Filtersystems GmbH, Bad Kreuznach, Germany). Example 4. Performance of recombinant Cel45 proteins in denim treatment at different temperatures Recombinant Cel45 proteins produced as described in Example 3 using Trichoderma as host were tested for their effect in biostoning of denim at different temperatures to create an abraded look similar to that provided by pumice stones. Commercial Cel45 enzymes Ecostone®N400 (Roal Oy, Finland) and Denimax™ 399S (Novozymes) were used for comparison. One pair of jeans made of Indigo dyed denim twill obtained from an English supplier was used as main test material after desizing with ECOS-TONE® A200 alpha-amylase and 2 pairs of desized Apache jeans (Labels Fashion Limited, U.K.) as filler material. The cellulase treatments were performed with Electrolux's Wascator FOM 71 CLS washer extractor under conditions described in Table 11. Table 11.

The enzyme activity was measured as the release of reducing sugars from carboxymethylcellulose (3% CMC) at 50°C in 50 mM Hepes buffer pH 7.0 (NCU activity Haakana et al. 2004). Recombinant Cel45 proteins were dosed as 1250 NCU/g fabric, Ecostone®N400 1500 NCU/g fabric and Denimax™ 399S 250 NCU/g. Dosing of each enzyme was sufficient to give easily measurable/detectable differences (increase of lightness = delta. L*>2 units) at the whole temperature range. Enzymes were inactivated after draining by raising the pH above 11 by adding 4.2 g of NaOH (10 min, 40°C) and rinsing three times. The jeans were dried in a tumbler. The biostoning effect/abrasion level of the main test material was evaluated by measuring the colour as reflectance values with Minolta CM 2500 spectrophotometer using L*a*b* colour space cooridinates (illuminant D65/ 2°). The colour from the face side and the reverse side of the denim was measured after desizing (i.e. before cellulase treatment) and after the cellulase treatment. Each measurement on the face side of denim was the average of approximate 40 measurements. Temperature profiles in denim application were also illustrated by calculating the relative performance (%) at 30°C compared to 50°C (30:50 ratio) and relative performance (%) at 40°C compared to optimal temperature (40/OT ratio). The results are shown in Tables 12-14 and Fig. 3. Table 12. Temperature profiles of Cel45 preparations in denim treatment.

Gp_RF6293_Cel45A shows optimal performance at a very broad temperature range from 30 to 50°C, which is surprising, because the temperature optimum at analytical conditions was remarkably higher (55-60°C, Fig. 2B). The optimal temperature range for Gp_RF6546_Cel45A and Fe_RF6318_Cel45A is also lower than for the commercial enzymes. Both Gp_RF6293_Cel45A and Fe_RF6318_Cel45A have higher performance at 40°C than at 50°C, which is a unique property compared to other enzymes belonging to the cel45 family, like the commercial preparations used as reference, and which typically work best at 50-60°C. The results in Table 13 show that both 30/50 and 40/OT ratios are more favorable with these novel endoglucanases than with commercial Cel45 preparations. The results in Table 14 show that with the recombinant Gp_RF6293_Cel45A enzyme a higher biostoning/abrasion effect at low temperature (30°C) can be obtained compared to commercial Cel45 enzymes.

Also the effect of the cellulase treatment was evaluated as in Example 4. The results are set forth in Table 15 and Fig. 4, which show that the optimal pH range for Gp_RF6293_Cel45A is 5-6.5 and for Fe_RF6318_Cel45A 6-6.5. Table 15.

Performance of recombinant Cel45 proteins in biofinishing (depilling/dehairing/defuzzing) The ability of recombinant Cel45 proteins produced as described in Example 3 using Trichoderma as host were tested in depilling of cotton knitwear and compared to Cel45 enzyme with excellent depilling properties (WO2006/117432). The cellulase treatments were performed with Electrolux's Wascator FOM 71 CLS washer extractor under conditions described in Table 16. Three yarn fleece made of 100% cotton (Type 9761, Orneule, Finland) was used as test material with filling material. Fabric was first prewashed for 10 min at 50°C and rinsed 3 times. After that the cotton knit fabric was treated with cellulase at 40°C or 50°C for 60 minutes. Enzymes were dosed as neutral cellulase activity units (NCU) per the weight of the fabric. After draining the enzyme was inactivated (for 10 min at 60°C) by raising the pH above 11 with sodium hydroxide. The fabric was then rinsed three times and dried in a tumbler. Table 16. The test conditions/process parameters used in biofinishing treatmentsProcess parameterFabric load1.0 kgWater15 literpH adjustmentWith acetic acid (80%)Time60 minTemperature40°C/50°CCellulase dosage250 NCU/g fabric The knitwear samples were evaluated visually according to how much surface fibrils and fuzz was detected. The result of each evaluation was quantified by indicating the result relative to a scale consisting of standards. These standards were pieces of the same fabric washed with different amounts of cellulase and they had a range of intensity of surface fibrils/fuzz from 1 to 5 with half unit's intervals. Number 0 was a control sample treated without enzyme. The higher the number, the better the depilling/dehairing effect is. Number 5 means that the surface fibrils/fuzz were/was removed. The results are shown in Tables 17 and 18. The results in Tables 17 and 18 show that Gp_RF6293_Cel45A, Gp_RF6546_Cel45A and Fe_RF6318_Cel45A have excellent depilling properties. It was surprising that Gp_RF6293_Cel45A was efficient in much lower activity dosage in depilling/dehairing than in denim treatment in the previous Examples. It was also found that the most optimal pH range for Gp_RF6293_Cel45A in depilling is from 5.5 to ca. 7. A neutral cellulase having excellent depilling properties, like the Gp_RF6293_Cel45A protein, enables biofinishing treatment simultaneously with dyeing. Table 17.
