Peptide analogues with branched amino acid probe(s) Field of invention The present invention relates to branched amino acid probes which are added to native peptides, or variants of said peptides, to produce peptide analogues or conjugates comprising a peptide and one or more branched amino acid probes. Background of invention Proteins and peptides are widely employed for therapeutic purposes whether in their native forms, variant forms or analogues thereof. Protein therapeutics tend to be specific for their targets, leading to potentially fewer side effects, but often with lower bioavailability, poorer membrane permeability, and metabolic instability, as compared to small molecules. Protein-based drugs are generally referred to as 'biologies' and include molecules such as insulin, growth factors, and engineered antibodies. Proteinaceous molecules typically require injection; nevertheless, biologies have been an extremely successful class of therapeutics including antibodies for treatment of arthritis and various cancers, soluble proteins for diabetes, myelosuppression and renal anemia; as well as short injectable peptides for multiple sclerosis, cancers, endometriosis and fibroids and acromegaly. Peptides represent a class of molecules that have the specificity and potency of larger protein biologies, but are smaller in size and more accessible and cheaper to manufacture using chemical methods, thus potentially combining some of the advantages of proteins with those of small molecules. Protein and peptide compounds can be modified in various ways in order to improve one or more features of the compound, or address one or more potential draw-backs of the compound. For example, a stabilizing peptide sequence may be added to the N- and/or C-terminus of pharmacologically active peptides potentially making them less susceptible to degradation (WO 99/46283). Further, a linear amino acid probe of 6 amino acids selected from Lys or Glu added to the N-terminus of α-MSH potentially increases efficacy compared to the native peptide (WO 07/22774). Known peptide-drug conjugates further include addition of polycationic peptides CPP (cell-penetrating peptides) to improve transport across the cell lipid bi-layer. Summary of invention The present invention provides peptide analogues comprising a peptide or protein, native or naturally occurring, or biologically active variants thereof, and one or more branched amino acid probes (abbreviated BAP herein). Modification of peptides by addition of one or more branched amino acid probes has not previously been disclosed. In some embodiments, the peptide analogues provided herein have one or more improved properties compared to the native peptide. For example, in some embodiments, addition of one or more branched amino acid probes to a peptide potentially improves one or more features of the peptide, such as improve or increase an inherent effect of the peptide (including for example increasing the activity, affinity and/or efficacy of a pharmacologically active peptide; improved binding to and/or activation of one or more relevant receptors); - alter an inherent effect of the peptide (including for example an altered receptor binding profile), or - improve or alter an external effect of the peptide (including for example increased stability, reduced degradation, altered configuration and/or altered solubility). Thus, the present invention relates to a peptide analogue comprising a peptide and one or more branched amino acid probes, wherein said branched amino acid probe comprises a first amino-alkyi amino acid residue, said first amino-alkyi amino acid residue optionally being covalently linked to a second amino-alkyi amino acid residue, or to a second and a third amino-alkyi amino acid residue, to form a linear chain of 2 or 3 amino-alkyi amino acid residues, wherein the side chain(s) of one or more of said first, second and/or third amino-alkyi amino acid residues are each modified by attaching to the side chain amino group a molecule independently selected from the group consisting of AAAq-AAA; (aa3)P-AAAq; AAAq-(aa3)P; [(aa3)-AAA]p and [AAA-(aa3)] ; wherein q is a number selected from 0, 1 , 2 and 3; p is a number selected from 1 , 2 and 3; AAA is an amino-alkyl amino acid residue; and (aa3) is an amino acid residue independently selected from Arg, His, Gly and Ala, wherein said amino-alkyl amino acid residues are optionally acetylated, wherein said first amino-alkyl amino acid residue is covalently linked to the N-terminus of said peptide, covalently linked to the C-terminus of said peptide, and/or attached to the side chain amino group of an amino-alkyl amino acid residue within said peptide, with the proviso that said branched amino acid probe consists of 2 to 9 amino acid residues. The present invention also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising the peptide analogues of the present invention, as well as the analogues of the present invention for use as a medicament.

Still further, in another embodiment, the peptide analogues provided herein are more stable, such as less susceptible to proteases. It is an aspect of the present invention to provide a peptide analogue comprising a peptide and one or more branched amino acid probes, wherein said branched amino acid probe comprises a first amino-alkyl amino acid residue, said first amino-alkyl amino acid residue optionally being covalently linked to a second amino-alkyl amino acid residue, or to a second and a third amino-alkyl amino acid residue, to form a linear chain of 2 or 3 amino-alkyl amino acid residues, wherein the side chain(s) of one or more of said first, second and/or third amino-alkyl amino acid residues are each modified by attaching to the side chain amino group a molecule independently selected from the group consisting of AAAq-AAA; (aa3)p-AAAq; AAAq-(aa3) ; [(aa3)-AAA]p and [AAA-(aa3)]P; wherein q is a number selected from 0, 1 , 2 and 3; p is a number selected from 1 , 2 and 3; AAA is an amino-alkyl amino acid residue; and (aa3) is an amino acid residue independently selected from Arg, His, Gly and Ala, wherein said amino-alkyl amino acid residues are optionally acetylated, wherein said first amino-alkyl amino acid residue is covalently linked to the N-terminus of said peptide, covalently linked to the C-terminus of said peptide, and/or attached to the side chain amino group of an amino-alkyl amino acid residue within said peptide, with the proviso that said branched amino acid probe consists of 2 to 9 amino acid residues.

In one embodiment, covalently linked means covalently linked by (a) peptide bond(s). In one embodiment, covalently linked implies that (a) peptide bond(s) is present. A peptide bond (amide bond) is a covalent chemical bond formed between two molecules when the carboxyl group of one molecule reacts with the amino group of the other molecule, causing the release of a molecule of H20. The process usually occurs between amino acids. The amino-alkyl amino acid residues (or AAA) according to the invention may each be the same (identical) or different (non-identical). Branched amino acid probe Amino-alkyl amino acid residue According to the present invention an 'amino-alkyl amino acid residue' (or AAA) is an amino acid having the conventional amine (-NH2) and carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional groups, and a side chain attached to the first (alpha-) carbon atom, wherein the side-chain comprises an alkyl group (-CnH2n+i) and an amino group (NH2); in one embodiment the side chain comprises an amino-alkyl group (-CnH2nNH2). Thus an amino-alkyl amino acid residue (or AAA) is an amino acid with a side chain comprising or consisting of an amino-alkyl group (-CnH2nNH2), in one embodiment denoted a side chain amino-alkyl group. In one embodiment the side chain alkyl group is derived from the group consisting of methyl (CH3-), ethyl (C2H5-), propyl (C3H7-), butyl (C4H9-), pentyl (C5Hn-), hexyl (C6Hi3- ), heptyl (C7H15-), octyl (C8Hi7-), nonyl (C9H19-), decyl (C10H21-), undecyl (C11 H23-) and dodecyl (Ci2H25-)- In one embodiment the side chain amino group (NH2) of said amino-alkyl amino acid residue is the amine of methylamine, the amine of ethylamine, the amine of propylamine, the amine of n-butylamine, the amine of pentylamine, the amine of n- hexylamine, the amine of heptylamine, the amine of octylamine, the amine of nonylamine, the amine of decylamine, the amine of undecylamine or the amine of dodecylamine. In one embodiment the side chain amino-alkyl group according to the invention is selected from the group consisting of methylamine (-CH2NH2), ethylamine (-C2H4NH2), propylamine (-C3H6NH2), n-butylamine (-C4H8NH2), pentylamine (-C5H10NH2), n- hexylamine (-C6H12NH2), heptylamine (.C7H14NH2), octylamine (-C8Hi6NH2), nonylamine (-C9H18NH2), decylamine (-C10H20NH2), undecylamine (-C11 H22NH2) and dodecylamine (. In one embodiment the side chain amino group (NH2) of said first, second and/or third amino-alkyl amino acid residues are each modified by attaching a molecule thereto. In one embodiment the side chain amino group of said amino-alkyl amino acid residue is selected from the group consisting of the β (beta) amino group (1 methylene in the side chain; methylamine); the y (gamma) amino group (2 methylenes in the side chain, ethylamine); the δ (delta) amino group (3 methylenes in the side chain, propylamine); = ornithine the ε (epsilon) amino group (4 methylenes in the side chain; n-butylamine); = lysine the ζ (zeta) amino group (5 methylenes in the side chain; pentylamine); the η (eta) amino group (6 methylenes in the side chain; n-hexylamine); the Θ (theta) amino group (7 methylenes in the side chain; heptylamine); the I (iota) amino group (8 methylenes in the side chain; octylamine); the K (kappa) amino group (9 methylenes in the side chain; nonylamine); the λ (lambda) amino group (10 methylenes in the side chain; decylamine); the μ (mu) amino group (1 1 methylenes in the side chain; undecylamine); and the v (nu) amino group (12 methylenes in the side chain; dodecylamine). For example, the ε-amino group is attached to the fifth carbon beginning from (including) the a-carbon, which a-carbon is attached to the carboxyl (C=OOH) group. An amino-alkyl amino acid residue wherein the side chain is n-butylamine and the side chain amino group is the ε (epsilon) amino group is lysine (Lys, K). Likewise, the δ-amino group is attached to the fourth carbon beginning from the a- carbon.

A peptide is a single linear polymer chain derived from the condensation of amino acids. Peptides may be distinguished from proteins on the basis of size, and as an arbitrary benchmark can be understood to contain approximately 75 (such as 50) or fewer amino acid residues. In one embodiment the peptide part of the peptide analogue of the present invention is a peptide having (comprising or consisting of) 2 to 100 amino acid residues, such as from 2 to 3, for example 3 to 4, such as 4 to 5, for example 5 to 6, such as 6 to 7, for example 7 to 8, such as 8 to 9, for example 9 to 10, such as 10 to 12, for example 12 to 14, such as 14 to 16, for example 16 to 18, such as 18 to 20, for example 20 to 25, such as 25 to 30, for example 30 to 40, such as 40 to 50, for example 50 to 75, such as 75 to 100 amino acid residues. In one embodiment the peptide of the present invention is a peptide having less than 50 amino acid residues, such as less than 40, for example less than 30, amino acid residues. The sequence of amino acid residues in a native peptide is defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code specifies 20 standard amino acids naturally incorporated into polypeptides (proteinogenic): Ala, Arg, Asn, Asp, Cys, Gin, Glu, Gly, His, lie, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Pro, Ser, Tyr, Thr, Trp, Val, and 2 which are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms: Sec (selenocysteine, or U) and Pyl (pyrrolysine, O). These are all L-stereoisomers. Aside from the 22 standard or natural amino acids, there are many other non-naturally occurring amino acids (non-proteinogenic or non-standard . They are either not found in proteins, or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery. Non-standard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids, such as post-translational modifications. Examples of unnatural amino acid residues are Nle (Norleucine), Orn (ornithine, deguanylated Arginine), Nal (beta-2- naphthyl-alanine), D-Nal (beta-2-naphthyl-D-alanine), D-Arg, D-Trp, D-Phe and D-Val. Any amino acids according to the present invention may be in the L- or D-configuration. If nothing is specified, reference to the L-isomeric form is preferably meant. The term peptide also embraces post-translational modifications introduced by chemical or enzyme-catalyzed reactions, as are known in the art. Such post- translational modifications can be introduced prior to partitioning, if desired. Also, functional equivalents may comprise chemical modifications such as ubiquitination, labeling (e.g., with radionuclides, various enzymes, etc.), pegylation (derivatization with polyethylene glycol), or by insertion (or substitution by chemical synthesis) of amino acids such as ornithine, which do not normally occur in human proteins. Peptides with N-terminal alkylations and C-terminal esterifications are also encompassed within the present invention. Functional equivalents also comprise glycosylated and covalent or aggregative conjugates formed with the same molecules, including dimers or unrelated chemical moieties. Such functional equivalents are prepared by linkage of functionalities to groups which are found in a fragment including at any one or both of the N- and C-termini, by means known in the art. In some embodiments, the peptides according to the present invention are modified by acetylation, such as N-terminal acetylation. In some embodiments the peptides according to the present invention are modified by C-terminal amidation. The peptides of the present invention may be any peptide known to the skilled person as having a biological effect. In one embodiment the addition of a branched amino acid probe to the peptide in question will influence said biological effect, such as enhance or improve a biological effect. A variant of a peptide of the invention is in one embodiment a peptide derived from the native peptide by fragmentation (such as N-terminal fragments, C-terminal fragments, or fragments from within a peptide), deletion, insertion, mutation or substitution of one or more amino acid residues (such as conservative amino acid substitution or introduction of non-proteinogenic amino acid residues), and/or modulation of the peptide such as by acetylation, by insertion of an amino acid in the D-configuration, and other modifications known to the skilled person.

Agonist In one embodiment the peptide analogue of the invention comprises an agonist. The term "agonist" in the present context refers to a substance or peptide as defined herein, capable of binding to, or in some embodiments, capable of binding to at least some extent and/or activating a receptor, or in some embodiments, activating a receptor to at least some extent. An agonist may be an agonist of several different types of receptors, and thus capable of binding and/or activating several different types of receptors. Said agonist can also be a selective agonist which only binds and activates one type of receptor. The term "antagonist" in the present context refers to a substance capable of inhibiting the effect of a receptor agonist. Full agonists bind (have affinity for) and activate a receptor, displaying full efficacy at that receptor. "Partial agonists" in the present context are peptides able to bind and activate a given receptor, but having only partial efficacy at the receptor relative to a full agonist. Partial agonists can act as antagonists when competing with a full agonist for receptor occupancy and producing a net decrease in the receptor activation compared to the effects or activation observed with the full agonist alone. "Selective agonists" in the present context are compounds which are selective and therefore predominantly bind and activate one type of receptor. Peptides according to the present invention are in one embodiment an agonist capable of binding and activating to some extent one or several receptors and can have different binding affinities and/or different receptor activation efficacy for different receptors, wherein affinity refers to the number and size of intermolecular forces between a peptide ligand and its receptor, and residence time of the ligand at its receptor binding site; and receptor activation efficacy refers to the ability of the peptide ligand to produce a biological response upon binding to the target receptor and the quantitative magnitude of this response. In some embodiments, such differences in affinity and receptor activation efficacy are determined by receptor binding/activation studies which are conventional in the art, for instance by generating EC50 and Emax values for stimulation of ligand binding in cells expressing one or several types of receptors, or on tissues expressing the different types of receptors. High affinity means that a lower concentration of a compound is needed to obtain a binding of 50% of the receptors compared to peptides which have lower affinity; high receptor activation efficacy means that a lower concentration of the peptide is needed to obtain a 50% receptor activation response (low EC50 value), compared to peptides which have lower affinity and/or receptor activity efficacy (higher EC50 value).

Methods of preparation The peptide analogues according to the present invention may be prepared by any suitable methods known in the art. Thus, in some embodiments the peptide and the branched amino acid probe are each prepared by standard peptide-preparation techniques, such as solution synthesis or solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) such as Merrifield-type solid phase synthesis. The peptide analogues of the invention are in one embodiment prepared by solid phase synthesis by first constructing the pharmacologically active peptide sequence, using well-known standard protection, coupling and de-protection procedures, thereafter sequentially coupling the branched amino acid probe onto the active peptide in a manner similar to the construction of the active peptide, and finally cleaving off the entire peptide analogue from the carrier. This strategy yields a peptide, wherein the branched amino acid probe is covalently bound to the pharmacologically active peptide at the N-terminal nitrogen atom of the peptide. In one embodiment, the alpha nitrogen on the final amino acid in the branched amino acid sequence is capped with acetyl, using standard acylation techniques, prior to or after coupling of the branched amino acid sequence on the active peptide. Reactive moieties at the N- and C-termini, which facilitates amino acid coupling during synthesis, as well as reactive side chain functional groups, can interact with free termini or other side chain groups during synthesis and peptide elongation and negatively influence yield and purity. Chemical groups are thus developed that bind to specific amino acid functional groups and block, or protect, the functional group from nonspecific reactions. Purified, individual amino acids are reacted with these protecting groups prior to synthesis and then selectively removed during specific steps of peptide synthesis. Examples of N-terminal protecting groups are t-Boc and Fmoc, commonly used in solid-phase peptide synthesis. C-terminal protecting groups are mostly used in liquid-phase synthesis. Because N-terminal deprotection occurs continuously during peptide synthesis, protecting schemes have been established in which the different types of side chain protecting groups (benzyl;Bzl or tert-butyl;tBu) are matched to either Boc or Fmoc, respectively, for optimized deprotection. In a particular embodiment of the invention, when preparing the branched amino acid probe, examplified by Ac(Ac-Lys-Lys)Lys-, the protection group for Lys is Mtt, which protected amino acid is commercially available (Fmoc-Lys( tt)-OH; N - a - Fmoc - N - ε - 4 - methyltrityl - L - lysine, CAS# 167393-62-6). Lys(Mtt) allows for capping Lys with acetyl as it is not cleaved under the conditions that cleave Fmoc, and may be removed without cleavage of other side chain protection groups. The method of preparation is in some embodiments optimized by routine methods in the art that may increase the yield and/or quality of the thus prepared synthetic peptide. For instance, use of pseudoproline (oxazolidine) dipeptides in the Fmoc SPPS of serine- and threonine-containing peptides may lead to improvements in quality and yield of crude products and may help avoid unnecessary repeat synthesis of failed sequences. These dipeptides are easy to use: simply substitute a serine or threonine residue together with the preceding amino acid residue in the peptide sequence with the appropriate pseudoproline dipeptide. The native sequence is regenerated on cleavage and deprotection. In one embodiment the sequence of the pharmacologically active peptide and the branched amino acid probe (or parts thereof) are each prepared separately by for example solution synthesis, solid phase synthesis, recombinant techniques, or enzymatic synthesis, followed by coupling of the (at least) two sequences by well- known segment condensation procedures, either in solution or using solid phase techniques, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the peptides are prepared by recombinant DNA methods and the branched amino acid probe is prepared by solid or solution phase synthesis. The conjugation of the peptide and the branched amino acid probe is in one embodiment carried out by using chemical ligation. This technique allows for the assembling of totally unprotected peptide segments in a highly specific manner. In another embodiment, the conjugation is performed by protease-catalysed peptide bond formation, which offers a highly specific technique to combine totally unprotected peptide segments via a peptide bond. In one embodiment, the C-terminal amino acid of the branched amino acid probe or the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide is attached to the solid support material by means of a common linker such as 2,4-dimethoxy-4'-hydroxy-benzophenone, 4-(4-hydroxy- methyl-3-methoxyphenoxy)-butyric acid, 4-hydroxy-methylbenzoic acid, 4- hydroxy methyl- phenoxyacetic acid, 3-(4-hydroxymethylphenoxy)propionic acid, or p - {(R,S) - a - [1 - (9H - Fluoren - 9 - yl) - methoxyformamido] - 2,4 - dimethoxybenzyl} - phenoxyacetic acid (Rink amide linker). Examples of suitable solid support materials (SSM) are e.g., functionalised resins such as polystyrene, polyacrylamide, polydimethylacrylamide, polyethyleneglycol, cellulose, polyethylene, polyethyleneglycol grafted on polystyrene, latex, dynabeads, etc. The produced peptide analogues of the invention are in some embodiment cleaved from the solid support material by means of an acid such as trifluoracetic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride, etc. optionally in combination with one phenol, thioanisole, etc. , or the peptide conjugate of the invention are in other embodiments cleaved from the solid support by means of a base such as ammonia, hydrazine, an alkoxide, such as sodium ethoxide, an hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide, etc. In other embodiments, the peptide analogues of the invention may be prepared or produced by recombinant techniques.Thus, in one aspect of the present invention the peptide is produced by host cells comprising a first nucleic acid sequence encoding the peptide or peptide analogue operably associated with a second nucleic acid capable of directing expression in said host cells. In some embodiments the second nucleic acid sequence comprises or even consists of a promoter that will direct the expression of protein of interest in said cells. A skilled person will be readily capable of identifying useful second nucleic acid sequences (e.g. vectors and plasmids) for use in a given host cell. The process of producing a recombinant peptide in general comprises the steps of: providing a host cell, preparing a gene expression construct comprising a first nucleic acid encoding the peptide operably linked to a second nucleic acid capable of directing expression of said protein of interest in the host cell, transforming the host cell with the construct and cultivating the host cell, thereby obtaining expression of the peptide. In one embodiment of the invention, the recombinantly produced peptide is excreted by the host cells. The host cell include any suitable host cell known in the art, including prokaryotic cells, yeast cells, insect cells and mammalian cells. In one embodiment, the recombinant peptide thus produced is isolated by any conventional method and may be linked via conventional peptide bond forming chemistry to any suitably protected branched amino peptide moiety. The skilled person will be able to identify suitable protein isolation steps for purifying the peptide.

Examples Example 1 - Synthesis of BAP-modified a-MSH peptide analogues. α-MSH analogue 1 : Ac-(Ac-Lys-Lys-)Lys-Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys-Pro-Val-NH2 y-MSH analogue 1 : Ac-(Ac-Lys-Lys-)Lys-Tyr-Val-Met-Gly-His-Phe-Arg-(D-Trp)-Asp- Arg-Phe-Gly-NH2. The peptides are manufactured using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) chemistry. Peptides are made using a polystyrene resin, functionalized with an appropriate linker, and the peptides are then manufactured using an Intavis Peptide Synthesizer. A 4-fold excess of amino acid is added relative to the resin and either HATU (0-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N', N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) or HCTU (2-(6-Chloro-1 H-benzotriazole-1 -yl)-1 , 1 ,3,3-tetramethylaminium hexafluorophosphate) were used at a 3.95-fold excess to create the active ester. Along with an 8-fold excess of DIPEA (Ν,Ν-Diisopropylethylamine) as the base, these reagents catalyze the addition of the next amino acid. Once the amino acid is coupled (each cycle includes a double coupling cycle to insure efficient coupling) the resin is exposed to 20% acetic anhydride to terminate ("cap-off') any peptide chains that have not added the next amino acid. The amino acids are dissolved in NMP (N-Methyl-2- pyrrolidone) or DMF (Dimethylformamide) For washing. Piperidine is used to remove the Fmoc group at the end of each coupling cycle which allows the next amino acid to be added. a-MSH analogue 1 was made with Lys(Mtt) on the end; the peptide was acetylated, the Mtt was removed , added Lys, added Lys and then acetylate again. For γ-MSH analogue 1 the addition of one or more pseudoproline (oxazolidine) dipeptides during the synthesis of serine- and/or threonine-containing peptides resulted in improvements in peptide quality and an increase in the yield of full length crude peptide. In this case the peptide was made up to the MEHF, a pseudoproline dipeptide (Fmoc-YS) was added, the next amino acid "Ser" was coupled 3 times to insure it went to completion, and the peptide finished manually by adding the Lys(Mtt), acetylating, and then finishing as above. In each case the peptides were dried using MeOH (3X), DCM (3X), cleaved using 92% TFA, 2% water, 2% triisopropylsilane, 2% thioanisole and 2% ethanedithiol for 3-4h at room temperature. Peptides were precipitated in cold diethyl ether, centrifuged (2,000 RPM) and the pellets washed 2X with cold ether. After drying the peptides were solubilized in water containing 0.1% TFA (buffer A) and subjected to RP-HPLC using C18 columns (buffer B = 95% acetonitrile/0.1 % TFA). The purity was determined by analytical HPLC and theoretical mono isotopic molecular masses we confirmed by MS. The sequence integrity was verified by CID tandem MS/MS sequencing. Example 2: Pharmacological characterization of BAP-modified a-MSH analogues. Method: Murine B16-F1 cells expressing MCr1 are used for determination of binding affinity to and agonist activity against the MC1r. Human recombinant CHO cells expressing MC3r, MC4r or MC5r are used for determination of affinity to or agonist activity against the MC3r, MC4r and MC5r, respectively. The binding affinity is determined in experiments conducted as described in the procedures for radioligand binding study catalogue no 0644 (MC1 r); no 0447 (MC3r); no 0420 (MC3r) and no 0448 (Mc5r) Cerep, France. In all experiments the Ki values are calculated based on the ability of the test compound to displace 125l-NDP-aMSH. The test items are tested in a concentration range of 10 13 to 105 M. For agonist activity against the MCRs the following procedures are conducted: The cells are incubated with test item at concentrations from 10 13 to 10"5 M. In all assays cAMP accumulation is determined after incubation and the response at a given concentration is expressed as a percent of the maximal control specific agonist response (measured specific response/control specific agonist response) x 100) when NDP-aMSH is used as positive control. The EC50 values (concentration producing a half-maximal specific response) are determined by non-linear regression analysis of the concentration-response curves generated with mean replicate values using Hill equation curve fitting where Y=specific response, D=minimum specific response, A=maximum specific response, C = compound concentration, and C50 = EC50, and nH = slope factor). For further details see the specific protocols for Cerep study protocol no 2147 (MC1 r); no 0959 (MC3r), no 0699 (MC4r) and no 1869 (MC5r).

For the lysine branching as described in more detail below, combination of orthogonally protected lysines were used including Fmoc-Lys(MTT)-OH, Fmoc-Lys(ivDde)-OH , and Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH. Peptides were cleaved with standard cleavage cocktails including trifluoroacetic acid, triisoproproylsilane, and water and precipitated with ice-cold ether. All crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase chromatography on columns with C-18 functionality and using gradients of acetonitrile, deionized water, and trifluoroacetic acid as running buffers.

Dose response curves were performed in parallel with test compounds, and reference compounds. The HTRF technology is a titration assay based on a competition between labeled cAMP (exogenous) and cAMP produced by the cell after activation of the MCr. The dynamic range of the assay was 3-4 fold meaning that the linear range (which enables conversion from raw data to nM of cAMP) is within that range. The window between top and bottom of the curve is higher (around 100) which means that converting into nM of cAMP, the assay window of cAMP goes from 1 nM (basal) to around 30 nM (Emax). All experiments were conducted in the presence of the non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (1 mM in final concentration). The test compounds were tested in a concentration range from 10 4 to 107 M Data is presented as mean values. The EC50 (ie the concentration induced 50% of max response) and the hill slope were determined by best fit analyses after logarithmic transformation using the graph pad software (version 6.0).

The lower Hill Slope indicates that agonist activity can be obtained at lower concentrations than what would be seen with the control peptide. Example 6: Pharmacological characterization of BAP- modified GLP-2 analogues Method: CHO-K1 cells expressing the human GLP-2 receptor grown in media without antibiotic were detached by gentle flushing with PBS-EDTA (5 mM EDTA), recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in assay buffer (KRH: 5 mM KCI, 1.25 mM MgS04, 124 mM NaCI, 25 mM HEPES, 13.3 mM Glucose, 1.25 mM KH2P04, 1.45 mM CaCI2, 0.5 g/l BSA). 12 μΙ of cells were mixed with 12 μΙ of the test compound (solubilized in PBS/0.5% BSA and finally diluted from a stock solution of 1 mM) at increasing concentrations in 96 wells plates and then incubated 30 min at room temperature. cAMP production was determined after addition of a lysis buffer and 1 hour incubation, by use of competitive immunoassay using cryptate-labeled anti-cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP (HTRF kit from CisBio) with Delta F percentage values calculated according to the manufacturer specification.

The EC50 (ie the concentration induced 50% of max response) and the Hill slope were determined by best fit analyses after logarithmic transformation using the graph pad software (version 6.0). Control peptide: GLP-2 (1-34): H-His-Ala-Asp-Gly-Ser-Phe-Ser-Asp-Glu-Met-Asn-Thr-lle-Leu-Asp-Asn-Leu-Ala-Ala- Arg-Asp-Phe-lle-Asn-Trp-Leu-lle-Gln-Thr-Lys-lle-Thr-Asp-Arg-OH Results: All three analogues showed full agonist activity when compared to the control peptide GLP-2 (1-34) with EC50 values in the nM range. Consequently the current examples of BAP modified GLP-2 analogues are full and potent agonists against the human GLP-2 receptor.

The resulting light emission was recorded using the Hamamatsu functional drug Screening system 6000 (FDSS6000). For standardization of emission of recorded light across plates and between experiments 100 μΜ digitonin or 20 μΜ ATP were added to some of the wells. Agonist activity was expressed as % of the maximal activity obtained with the internal control compound Trp-Lys-T r-Met-Val-Met The test compounds were tested in a concentration range from 10 1 to 105 M Data is presented as mean values. When possible the EC50 (ie the concentration induced 50% of max response) was determined by best fit analyses after logarithmic transformation using the graph pad software (version 6.0).

In contrast to this both analogue 6 and analogue 7 showed agonist activity. For Analogue 6 the agonist activity reached 33 % of the max response seen with the internal control compound Trp-Lys- Tyr-Met-Val-Met. The corresponding maximal activity of control compound 1 was less than 1%. For analogue 7, EC50 was determined to 1.56 μΜ. The maximal agonist response obtained at the highest tested dose was 85% of the max response obtained with the Trp-Lys-Tyr-Met-Val-Met hexapeptide, whereas the maximal activity of control peptide was less than 1 %.
