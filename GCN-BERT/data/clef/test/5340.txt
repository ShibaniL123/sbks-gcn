The subject of invention are new functionalized unsaturated double-decker derivatives of divinylsilsesquioxanes. The structure of double-decker divinyl-substituted silsesquioxanes is different from that of the symmetric system of cubic cages described by the formula (RSiO3/2)n=8 (T8) and includes two cyclosiloxane rings in parallel planes with 8 inert R1 groups at the silicon atoms of each ring. The rings are joined by bridges of two types: the first type joins the opposite oxygen atoms, while the second type is via O2SiCH═CH2 groups. In this structure the vinyl groups at the silicon atoms are at the two opposite sides of the molecule and decide about its asymmetry relative to R3 groups at the silicon atoms of siloxane rings (WO2003/024870). Double-decker functionalized unsaturated derivatives of divinylsilsesquioxanes, built of an inorganic siloxane skeleton that can bind a wide range of functional groups, make suitable substrate for the synthesis of hybrid materials and can be used as nanofillers in the new generation composite materials. The presence of unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds additionally improves the photophysical properties of these compounds. Miyashita has described carbazole silsesquioxane derivatives and their interesting optoelectronic properties that permit their use as organic electroluminescence diodes (M. Kohri, J. Matusi, A. Watanabe, T. Miyashita Chem. Lett. 2010, 39, 1162). Lee has presented the use of silsesquioxane derivatives as ligands for the synthesis of titanium coordination compounds that represent the group of metallasilsesquioxane coordination oligomers (M. T. Hay, B. Seurer, D. Holmes, A. Lee Macromolecules 2010, 43, 2108), while Basset has reported their use in the synthesis of zirconium and hafnium complexes used as models of catalysts for polymerisation of olefins immobilised on silica (J. Espinas, J. D. A. Pelletier, E. Abou-Hamad, L. Emsley, J.-M. Basset Organometallics 2012, 31, 7610). The unsaturated amine and norbornene derivatives of silesquioxanes described by Kakimoto have been used for modification of polyimides; when built in the main polymer chain they considerably improved its thermal and optical properties (S. Wu, T. Hayakawa, M. Kakimoto, H. Oikawa Macromolecules 2008, 41). The known method for the synthesis of double-decker divinylsilsesquioxanes has been presented in patent EP.1428795 and involves the condensation of vinyldichloromethylsilane with a silane derivative of silsesquioxane comprising four reactive Si—OH groups. In this method it is necessary to use chlorosilane susceptible to hydrolysis in the presence of trace amounts of moisture, which interferes with the synthesis and isolation of the product desired. Seurer, B.; Vij, V.; Haddad, T.; Mabry, J. M.; Lee, A. Macromolecules 2010, 43, 9337-9347) have revealed the aryl derivatives of silsesquioxanes containing unsaturated bonds, but these bonds are at the external ends of aryl substituents. The subject of the invention are new functionalized unsaturated double-decker derivatives of divinylsilsesquioxanes, of the general formula 1, In which R1 are the same and stand for aryl group containing from 1 to 2 rings,R2 are the same and stand for: Alkyl group from C1 to C2 Unsubstituted aryl group containing from 1 to 2 rings, orMonosubstituted aryl group containing from 1 to 2 rings and substituted at any site of the ring with an alkoxyl group comprising an alkyl group with carbon atoms from C1 to C3,R3 are the same and stand for A group of formula 2 [in-line-formulae]—R4-R5—(2)[/in-line-formulae]Where R4 stands for an alkyl group comprising carbon atoms from C1 to C3, and R5 stands for an aryl group containing from 1 to 2 rings,Unsubstituted aryl group containing from 1 to 2 rings,Aryl group containing from 1 to 2 rings and substituted at any site with: An alkyl group containing carbon atoms from C1 to C2 An alkoxyl group comprising an alkyl group containing carbon atoms from C1 to C2 halogen X=F, Cl, Brfully substituted halogenalkyl containing carbon atoms from C1 to C2 and F or The synthesis of functionalized unsaturated double-decker derivatives of divinylsilsesquioxanes of formula 1, in which R1, R2 and R3 are as defined above, is based on silylative coupling of the double-decker divinylsilsesquioxanes of the general formula 3, in which R1 and R2 are as defined above, with olefins of the general formula 4, in which R3 is as defined above, in the presence of a ruthenium complex as a catalyst. The ruthenium complex used as a catalyst has a general formula 5 [in-line-formulae]RuHCl(CO)[P(R5)3]n (5)[/in-line-formulae] In which n stands for 2 or 3; if n=3, then R5 stands for triphenylphosphine, while if n=2, then R5 stands for tricyclohexylphosphine or triisopropylphosphine. The catalyst is used in the amount from 1×10−3 to 1×10−1 mole Ru per each mole of the unsaturated group taking part in the reaction of divinylsilsesquioxane of the general formula 3 with an olefin of the general formula 4; it is favourable to use the catalyst in the amount from 0.5×10−2 to 2×10−2 and the most favourable to use 1×10−2 mole. A favourable effect on the course of the reaction has an addition of copper(I) or copper(II) salts as co-catalyst, in particular copper(I) salt, and the most favourable effect has the use of copper(I) chloride in the amount of 10−1-10 Cu mole, favourably 5 Cu moles per 1 Ru mole. The reaction is performed in a solvent, under neutral gas atmosphere, in an open or closed system, it is favourable to use gas without oxygen and moisture. In open systems the reaction is performed at a temperature not higher than the boiling point of the reaction mixture. In closed systems the reaction is performed at temperatures not higher than 200° C. It is favourable, but not necessary, to use an excess of olefin with respect to divinylsilsesquioxane to hasten the reaction. It is favourable to use olefin in excess of 1.1 to 2 moles per each mole of CH2═CH groups in divinylsilsesquioxane of formula 3, the most favourable excess of olefin in close to 1.5. The reaction is performed in a solvent chosen from among: aromatic organic compounds, favourably in toluene, benzene, xylenes, the most favourably in toluene; chlorinated aliphatic compounds or their mixtures. It is favourable to perform the reaction in 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, methyl chloride; the most favourable is to use methylene chloride or toluene. It is favourable to perform the reaction in the following way. Proper amounts of divinylsilsesquioxane solvent, alkene and catalyst are placed in a reactor under neutral gas atmosphere. The reaction mixture is stirred upon heating up to 40° C. or higher temperature, and the process is continued at a temperature from 40° C. to the boiling point of the reaction mixture. It is favourable to maintain a constant temperature throughout the process. The reaction takes from 1 to 48 hours. If a co-catalyst is used, it is introduced to the mixture of reagents and a catalyst after having heated it to a temperature above 40° C. The temperature at which the co-catalyst is introduced must be not lower than 40° C. but not higher than the boiling point of the reaction mixture. The presence of the co-catalyst enhances the rate of the reaction and the yield of the product, and reduces the amount of side products formed. It is favourable to have all the reagents dried and deoxygenated prior to the reaction. The reaction in closed systems is performed in the same conditions and in the open systems. The raw product is isolated from the reaction mixture by precipitation initiated by a solvent chosen from the groups of aliphatic hydrocarbons containing carbon atoms from C5 to C10, MeOH, MeCN, the most favourable is hexane, or by solvent removal. If the second procedure is used, after evaporation of the solvent, the catalyst is washed out by a solvent which is an aliphatic hydrocarbon containing carbon atoms from C5 to C10, which selectively dissolves only the catalyst. The raw product can be subjected to further purification on a chromatographic column with the eluent made of a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbon and a chloroderivative of an aliphatic hydrocarbon; it is favourable to use hexane:methylene chloride at a ratio from the range 10-0:0-10, the most favourably at the ratio 5:5. After purification the eluent is evaporated and pure product is obtained. The synthesis of double-decker derivatives of divinylsilsesquioxanes according to the invention is illustrated by the examples given below. The products were analysed by taking the following spectra: 1H and 13C-NMR on a spectrometer VarianGemini 300, at 300 and 75 MHz29Si NMR on a spectrometer VarianAvance 600, at 119 and 203 MHz.Mass spectra on a 4000 Q TRAP instrument made by Applied Biosystems.
