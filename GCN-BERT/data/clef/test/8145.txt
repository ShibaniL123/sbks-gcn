Example 1A
rac-(2R,3S,4R,5R)-tert-butyl 3-(tert-butyl)-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-4-nitro-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylate
A solution of rac-(2R,3S,4R,5R)-tert-butyl 3-(tert-butyl)-4-nitro-5-phenylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (Core 1, 2.0 g, 5.74 mmol) and triethylamine (1.203 mL, 8.61 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (20 mL) at 0° C. was treated with cyclohexanecarbonyl chloride (0.998 mL, 7.46 mmol), stirred at 0° C. for 30 minutes, and stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. CH2Cl2 (20 mL) was added. The mixture was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, concentrated and chromatographed on a 25 g silica gel cartridge eluting with 0-60% ethyl acetate in heptane to provide title compound (1.6 g, 3.49 mmol, 60.8% yield), which was used without further purification. LC/MS (APCI+) m/z 403.3 (M+H)+.
