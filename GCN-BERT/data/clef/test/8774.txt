EDITORIAL NOTE 2015101259 There are 3 pages of Description which are not page numbered A New Cup Technical Field This utility model is a kind of new cup. Background Technology Cup is one of common home appliances. In existing technologies, most cups are placed in a straight way after use, and toothbrush is placed in the cup. As a result, it is easy to cause dirt condensation at the bottom of the cup. After a long period of time, it will cause oral bacteria. If the cup is placed upside down, there is no place for toothbrush. Description on the Invention The technical issue to be solved by this utility model is to provide a kind of new cup. The cover of this device is connected with the washing platform. Under the normal state, the body is placed upside down on the cover. Toothbrush is fixed in the placing groove. This structure can effectively avoid dirt condensation in the body. It is sanitary for use. To solve the said issue, this utility model adopts the following technical scheme: This kind of new cup includes the main body. A cup base is arranged at the bottom of the said body. A placing groove is arranged at the bottom of the said base. Both ends of the said placing groove runs through the said base in the radial direction. A cover is arranged on the top of the said body. A convex for coordination of the said body is arranged at the bottom of the said cover. It is of transitional coordination between the said convex and the said body. An antiskid pad is arranged on the top of the said cover. As an optimized technical scheme, the said body is made of PVC plastics or glass. The wall thickness of the said body is lmm-2mm. As an optimized technical scheme, a limit ring is arranged at the position close to the top of the outer ring of the said body. The said limit ring is made of rubber. It is of glue fixing between the said limit ring and the said body. As an optimized technical scheme, it is of glue fixing between the said antiskid pad and the said cup cover. The thickness of the said antiskid pad is lmm-1.2mm. The said antiskid pad is made of rubber. Antiskid teeth are provided on the surface of the antiskid pad. As an optimized technical scheme, scale is of axial arrangement on the outer surface of the said body. Beneficial effects of this utility model are described as follows: The cover of this device is connected with the washing platform. Under the normal state, the body is placed upside down on the cover. Toothbrush is fixed in the placing groove. This structure can effectively avoid dirt condensation in the body. It is sanitary for use. This device is featured by simple structure and low cost. It is suitable for promotion and wide application.
