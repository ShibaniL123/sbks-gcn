REFERENCE TO PRIOR APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application 60/689,529 filed Jun. 13, 2005, and to French patent application 0551301 filed May 19, 2005, both incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to vectorization of double stranded RNA oligonucleotides by cationic particles chosen from among surfactant micelles, block or non-block polymer micelles, cationic liposomes and niosomes, cationic oleosomes and cationic nanoemulsions, as well as from among cationic organic or inorganic particles and nanocapsules, and topical compositions for the skin, mucous membranes or eyes. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Research is being conducted on the use of substances having specific activity, such as specific biological activity, in the cosmetics field such as skin care or hair care, but also in the dermatological and pharmaceutical fields. Recently, the use of dsRNA and more particularly siRNA (containing 12 to 40 nucleotides) has made it possible to achieve specific activity in inhibition of the synthesis of a target protein. The molecular mechanism taking place involves double stranded RNA fragments composed of 12 to 40 nucleotides. Degradation of the target mRNA is achieved by activation of the complex known as RISC (RNA Induced Silencing Complex), which acts by fixation of the anti-sense strand of the dsRNA onto the mRNA. These double stranded RNA oligonucleotides are also known as dsRNA or else siRNA (for “short interfering” RNA); see Tuschl T., Chem. Biochem. 2001, 2, 239-245; Nykanen A et al., Cell 2001, 107, 309-321, Dorsett Y., Nature, April 2004, Vol. 3, pages 318-329; and Downward, J., BMJ 2004, 328, 1245-1248. However, the topical application of these siRNA, which can have molecular weights of approximately 15 to 17 kD, gives rise to the problem of penetration. In fact, for the specific activity relative to the selected siRNA to be effective, it must penetrate into the target cell (such as the keratinocytes or the melanocytes, etc.) as far as its cytoplasm. As it happens, the stratum corneum, the site of the skin barrier function, is difficult to penetrate. International Application WO 03/101376 describes cosmetic preparations comprising at least one double stranded RNA oligonucleotide. In this publication, the oligonucleotide is necessarily complexed with a cationic polymer such as PEI or chitosan, after which this complex of oligonucleotide and cationic polymer can be encapsulated in liposomes or niosomes and/or adsorbed at the surface of particles such as liposomes, niosomes, oleosomes, nanospheres and nanocapsules. Therefore, the dsRNA is necessarily complexed with a cationic polymer before being associated with a type of particle. In addition, the surfactant micelles are not described as an efficient medicinal solution for vectorization of siRNA. In the article “Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 suppression in skin by topical delivery of anti-sense oligonucleotides,” Mehta et al. (J. Invest. Dermatol. 115, 805-812, 2000), the authors transport single stranded RNA in an emulsion containing 25% of surfactants (10% of glyceryl stearate and 15% of 40 OE stearate). Besides the fact that this article does not describe the siRNA, the proposed medicinal solution is not compatible with good tolerance. In fact, the 25% of surfactants will have the effect of destroying the barrier function of the skin, thus increasing its permeability to external elements and dramatically favoring its dehydration: results that are not sought in the fields of application envisioned by the present invention. In the publication “Lipidic carriers of siRNA: differences in the formulation, cell uptake and delivery with plasmid DNA,” Spagnou et al. (Biochemistry, 43, 13348-56, 2004), the authors use cationic liposomes such as lipofectamine 2000 or DOPE liposomes “cationized” with cholesteryloxycarbonyl-3,7-diazanone-1,9-diamine (CDAN). For safety reasons, lipofectamine cannot be used on human skin. Other publications (Yano Junichi et al., Clinical Cancer Research, 2004, Spagnou et al., Biochemistry, 2004, and Ma Zheng et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 2004) have proposed associating siRNA with cationic vesicles composed of oleyl chain lipids containing unsaturated bonds that make them very sensitive to oxidation, and phospholipids, these vesicles being intended to be used immediately after preparation, because they are not very stable in time. International Patent Application WO 2004/046354 describes the use of siRNA for cutaneous dysfunction, preferably at the dermis level. The compositions described, such as PIT and W/O, O/W and W/O/W emulsions, are all nonionic. In that patent application, no appraisal is made of the major and essential interest of using cationic surfactants in cationic particles in order to favor penetration of the siRNA into cutaneous structures. Moreover, although the PIT can be smaller than μm size, they are necessarily nonionic, as described in International Patent WO96/28132. International Application WO 03/106636 describes the association of a polynucleotide with a cationic surfactant such as cetyltriammonium chloride to form a complex. It is then necessary to stabilize this complex by an incubation step at a temperature of between 35 and 50° C. In a second step, it is possible to dehydrate the mixture to obtain therefrom a powder, which will then be diluted in a chosen solvent before use (injection). Once the complex has been formed, it is also possible to stabilize it by addition of an amphiphilic lipid, which can be a nonionic surfactant. This ternary association is then dehydrated to obtain a powder, which will then be diluted in an appropriate aqueous solution. International Application WO 03/106636 does not specify that the concentration of the cationic surfactant must be above the CMC (critical micellar concentration) in order to form the complex of polynucleotide and cationic surfactant, since the complex can be formed below the CMC. It is only once this complex has been formed that the addition of another amphiphilic compound capable of forming micelles is envisioned. In this way the integration of a complex of polynucleotide and cationic surfactant into amphiphilic micelles is achieved. Thus the question of associating cationic particles with a polynucleotide is not addressed in that document. However, there remains a need to identify a way to permit the penetration of siRNA into the skin models. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide compositions and methods for permitting the penetration of double-stranded and/or siRNA into keratinous and/or ocular substances. The invention provides a topical or ocular composition comprising at least one dsRNA associated with at least one cationic particle of a size less than or equal to 1 μm and having a zeta potential of from 10 to 80 mV, and which is chosen from a surfactant micelle, a block polymer micelle, a liposome of nonionic and/or cationic surfactants, niosomes, oleosomes, particles of nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, organic particles, or inorganic particles. The invention also provides providing a RNA molecule to a keratinous and/or ocular surface for a cosmetic purpose using the composition described herein. The invention also provides methods of inhibiting a protein in a keratinous substance, e.g., skin and hair, and/or eyes by administering the composition as well as generally methods of delivering the dsRNA to an individual in need thereof. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein: FIGS. 1A-1F show the results of cell targeting in Episkin—day 6 where FIG. 1A shows Block-It Fluorescent Oligo (DAPI); FIG. 1B shows Block-It Fluorescent Oligo+Lipofectamine 2000 (DAPI); FIG. 1C shows Block-It Fluorescent Oligo+E2 (×40, DAPI); FIG. 1D: E2 (×40, DAPI); FIG. 1E shows Block-It Fluorescent Oligo+E2 (×100, DAPI); and FIG. 1F shows Block-It Fluorescent Oligo+E2 (×100). FIGS. 2A-2C show the results of Cell targeting in Episkin—day 13 where FIG. 2A shows Block-It Fluorescent Oligo (×40, DAPI); and FIGS. 3A-3H and FIGS. 4A-4D show visualization of the effect of the formulation comprising octyl glucoside and CTAB in different concentrations on the viability of HaCaT cells. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Unexpectedly, the association of siRNA with cationic particles permits a very significant improvement for penetrating into target cells of a tissue such as the skin, especially skin models. After penetration, the siRNA becomes active. The penetration can be evaluated using a fluorescent marker fixed on the siRNA, and its activity can be evaluated by quantification of the targeted messenger by quantitative PCR or by assay of the protein corresponding to the targeted messenger RNA. The cationic particles of the invention can be surfactant micelles, block or non-block polymer micelles, cationic liposomes and niosomes, cationic oleosomes, cationic nanoemulsions, as well as cationic organic or inorganic particles and nanocapsules. Thus, the object of the present invention therefore relates firstly to a topical or ocular composition comprising at least one double stranded RNA oligonucleotide, characterized in that the double stranded RNA oligonucleotide is associated with at least one cationic particle of size smaller than or equal to 1 μm, of zeta potential between 10 and 80 mV, chosen from among surfactant micelles, in particular micelles of nonionic amphiphilic surfactants and cationic surfactants, block polymer micelles, in particular micelles of cationic amphiphilic block polymer, micelles of nonionic amphiphilic block polymer and of cationic amphiphilic block polymer and micelles of nonionic amphiphilic block polymer and of cationic surfactant, liposomes of nonionic and cationic surfactants, niosomes, oleosomes, particles of nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, organic particles or inorganic particles. The present invention relates to the association of cationic particles with at least one dsRNA that will adhere to the surface of the particle, the latter acting as a vehicle to allow it to penetrate into the cutaneous structures and into the target cells of the skin, mucous membranes or even eyes, for cosmetic, dermatological and/or ophthalmic applications. The cationic particles according to the invention are particles having a size less than or equal to 1 μm, preferably less than or equal to 500 nm, even more preferentially less than or equal to 300 nm, which can be measured with, for example, a laser granulometer of the type BI90 plus of the Brookhaven Co., and which have a zeta potential of between 10 and 80 mV, measurable with a zetameter of the type DELSA 440 of the Coultronics Co. Hereinafter there is presented a non-exhaustive list of cationic particles than can be used according to the invention. Surfactant Micelles As known in the art, micelles are aggregates that amphiphilic molecules form spontaneously when they are solubilized in water or oil above a certain critical concentration: the CMC. The micelles that can be used within the scope of the invention are composed of at least one cationic surfactant. This cationic surfactant can be associated with one or more nonionic amphiphilic surfactants. The person skilled in the art will advantageously select the nonionic and cationic surfactants in the 1998 and subsequent editions of McCutcheon's “Emulsifiers and Detergents”. Non-limiting examples of the cationic surfactants that can be used within the scope of the invention are listed hereinafter. Non-limiting examples of nonionic surfactants that can be used are: alkyl and polyalkyl (C6 to C30, saturated or unsaturated, branched or linear) esters or ethers of POE, glycerol and polyglycerol, of sorbitan with or without oxyethylene groups, of sucrose, of glucose with or without oxyethylene groups, of nialtose and of POP-POE. If mixtures of nonionic surfactants and cationic surfactants are included, their respective proportions by weight will be between 99/1 and 1/99. The proportions of surfactants forming the micelles will be dependent on the CMC thereof. Within the scope of the invention, however, the concentration of micellar surfactants will be between 0.1 and 10% and preferably between 0.2 and 5% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. Block Polymer Micelles The micelles of amphiphilic block polymers can be prepared by the method described in International Application WO 04/035013. The block copolymers that are useful for preparation of micelles associated with the dsRNA according to the invention are, in particular, amphiphilic block polymers, preferably of nonionic, di-block or tri-block type that can form micelles upon contact with water. In particular, they are of the di-block type (A-B) or of the tri-block type (A-B-A), where A corresponds to a nonionic hydrophilic polymeric block and B to a hydrophobic polymeric block. The molecular weight of the polymers can be between 1000 and 100,000, and the A/B ratio can be between 1/100 and 50/1. The nonionic hydrophilic polymeric block can be chosen from among ethylene polyoxide (POE), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyacrylic acid (PAA). The hydrophobic polymeric block can be chosen from among polystyrene, poly(tert-butylstyrene), poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(ethyl acrylate), poly(butyl acrylate), poly(butyl methacrylate), poly(vinyl acetate), polycaprolactones, polycaprolactams, polydimethylsiloxanes, polyoxides of C3 to C6 alkylene, poly(aspartic acid), poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), polyleucine, polybutadienes, polyethylenes, polypropylenes and polybutylenes. The block copolymer is preferably chosen from among the following block copolymers: propylene polyoxide/ethylene polyoxidepolystyrene/polyoxyethylenepolymethyl methacrylate/polyoxyethylenepolybutyl methacrylate/polyoxyethylenepolyoxybutylene/polyoxyethylenepolycaprolactone/polyoxyethylenepolyethylene/polyoxyethylenepolyoxyethylene/polyoxybutylene/polyoxyethylene. Within the scope of the invention, the following can be added to add to the micellar composition: a cationic amphiphilic block polymer in which one of the blocks is cationic and can be chosen from among, for example: trimethylethylammonium polymethacrylate;quaternized dimethylaminoethyl polymethacrylate;polymethylvinylimidazolium;polyvinylbenzyltrimethylammonium chloride; the association of a nonionic amphiphilic block polymer with a cationic amphiphilic block polymer is such that the ratio between the two will be between 99/1 and 1/99; and/or at least one cationic surfactant such as listed hereinafter. In this case, the respective ratio between the nonionic amphiphilic block polymer and the cationic surfactant will be between 50/50 and 99/1. Within the scope of the invention, the concentration of micellar block polymers that are or are not associated with a cationic surfactant will be between 0.1 and 10% and preferably between 0.2 and 5% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. In an alternative version of the invention, it is also possible to form micelles composed of cationic amphiphilic block polymers such as described in the foregoing. Liposomes and Niosomes The nonionic amphiphilic lipids capable of forming nonionic liposomes are in particular those described in Patent Application EP 0582503. In particular, the nonionic amphiphilic lipids can be composed of a mixture of esters of at least one polyol chosen in the group formed by polyethylene glycol having 1 to 60 ethylene oxide units, sorbitan, sorbitan with 2 to 60 ethylene oxide units, glycerol with 2 to 30 ethylene oxide units, polyglycerols with 2 to 15 glycerol units, sucroses, glucoses with 2 to 30 ethylene oxide units, and at least one fatty acid having a C5 to C17 saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched alkyl chain, the number of alkyl chains per polyol group being between 1 and 10. The expression “mixture of esters” covers not only mixtures of pure esters of different chemical families but also products that contains a plurality of chemically pure polyol esters of the same family in variable proportions. This is the case in particular of products that have a statistical formula in their hydrophilic part, such as a polyglycerol ester of formula CO—(OCH2—CHOH—CH2)n—OH, where n is a statistical value, and that can contain diverse proportions of esters for which n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4, etc.; this is also the case of esters containing a plurality of alkyl chains in their lipophilic part, such as the cocoates, which contain C5 to C17 alkyl chains, or the isostearates, where the C17 alkyl chains are a complex mixture of isomeric forms; it is also the case of products composed of mixtures of mono-, di-, tri- or polyesters of one and the same polyol. It must be noted that a product that would contain only a single ester capable of forming vesicles together with impurities of another type could not be used according to the invention. Commercial esters that can be used alone according to the invention, because in reality they are mixtures of esters are, for example, the following: the partial esters of sorbitan (or sorbitol anhydride) and fatty acid, sold under the trade names “SPAN 20, 40, 60 and 80” by the ICI Co.;sorbitan isostearate, sold under the trade name “SI 10 R NIKKOL” by the NIKKO Co.;sorbitan stearate with 4 ethylene oxide units, sold under the name “TWEEN 61” by the ICI Co.;polyethylene glycol stearate with 8 ethylene oxide units, sold under the name “MYR J 45” by the ICI Co.;polyethylene glycol monostearate of formula EMI6.1, in which formula n is equal to 4, sold under the name “MYS 4” by the NIKKO Co.;polyethylene glycol stearate of molecular weight 400, chemical grade or grade produced by biotechnology, sold by the UNICHEMA Co.;diglyceryl stearate with 4 ethylene oxide units, sold under the name “HOSTACERINE DGS” by the HOECHST Co.;tetraglycerol stearate, sold under the name “TETRAGLYN 1S” by the NIKKO Co.;diglyceryl isostearate, sold by the SOLVAY Co.;diglyceryl distearate, sold under the name “EMALEX DSG 2” by the NIHON Co.;sucrose mono-, di- and tripalmitostearates, sold under the names “F50, F70, F110 AND F160 CRODESTA” by the CRODA Co.;the mixture of sucrose mono- and dipalmitostearates, sold under the name “GRILLOTEN PSE 141 G” by the GRILLO Co.;the mixture of sucrose stearate and sucrose cocoate, sold under the name “ARLATONE 2121” by the ICI Co.;methylglucose distearate with 20 ethylene oxide units, sold under the name ‘GLUCAM E 20 DISTEARATE” by the AMERCHOL Co. Of course, it is possible to use mixed combinations of these different products that are already mixtures or mixed combinations of these products with pure products. The cationic surfactants are chosen in the list hereinafter, in such a way that they impart a pH of between 5 and 8 to the dispersion, wherein the ratio by weight between the quantity of nonionic amphiphilic lipids and the quantity of cationic surfactants in the lipid phase is between 50/1 and 50/25, and the ratio by weight between the lipid phase and the aqueous dispersion phase is between 1/1,000 and 300/1,000. Oleosomes The oleosomes relating to the invention are described in Patent Application EP They comprise an emulsion of the oil-in-water type formed from oil globules provided with a lamellar liquid crystal coating and dispersed in an aqueous phase, characterized in that each oil globule is individually coated with a monolamellar or oligolamellar layer (1 to 10 lamellas that are visible under the transmission electron microscope after cryofracture) obtained from at least one lipophilic surface-active agent, at least one hydrophilic surface-active agent and at least one cationic surfactant, which imparts a pH ranging from 5 to 8 to the emulsion, the coated oil globules having an average diameter less than 500 nanometers. The lipophilic surface-active agent and the hydrophilic surface-active agent each contain at least one saturated fatty chain having more than approximately 12 carbon atoms. More preferentially, this fatty chain contains 16 to 22 carbon atoms. According to another preferential embodiment of the invention, the lipophilic surface-active agent has an HLB of between approximately 2 and approximately 5. As is well known, there is understood by HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) the equilibrium between the dimension and strength of the hydrophilic group and the dimension and strength of the lipophilic group of the surface-active agent. Examples of such lipophilic surface-active agents are sucrose distearate, diglyceryl distearate, tetraglyceryl tristearate, decaglyceryl decastearate, diglyceryl monostearate, hexaglyceryl tristearate, decaglyceryl pentastearate, sorbitan monostearate, sorbitan tristearate, diethylene glycol monostearate, the glycerol ester of palmitic and stearic acids, 2 OE polyoxyethylene monostearate (containing 2 oxyethylene units), glyceryl mono- and dibehenate, and pentaerythritol tetrastearate. The hydrophilic surface-active agent preferably has an HLB of between approximately 8 and approximately 12. As examples of such hydrophilic surface-active agents there can be cited the following compounds: polyoxyethylene (4 OE) sorbitan monostearate, polyoxyethylene (20 OE) sorbitan tristearate, polyoxyethylene (8 OE) monostearate, hexaglyceryl monostearate, polyoxyethylene (10 OE) monostearate, polyoxyethylene (12 OE) distearate and polyoxyethylene (20 OE) methylglucose distearate. The cationic surfactants can be chosen from among the compounds cited hereinafter. Nanoemulsions The cationic particles can also be chosen from among the oil-in-water nanoemulsions containing an oily phase dispersed in an aqueous phase, wherein the oil globules have a number-average size less than 100 nm, characterized in that they comprise at least one amphiphilic lipid comprising at least one nonionic amphiphilic lipid and one cationic amphiphilic lipid, the oily phase and the amphiphilic lipids being present in a content such that the weight ratio of the oily phase to amphiphilic lipid ranges from 3 to 10. The nanoemulsions generally have a bluish transparent appearance. Their transparency is measured by the coefficient of transmittance at 600 nm—ranging from 10 to 90%- or else by turbidity. The turbidity of the compositions of the invention ranges from 60 to 400 NTU and preferably from 70 to 300 NTU, which turbidity is measured with the portable HACH turbidimeter, model 2100 P, at approximately 25° C. The oil globules of the nanoemulsions of the invention have a number-average size of less than 100 nm, preferably ranging from 20 to 80 nm and more preferentially from 40 to 60 nm. Reduction of the size of the globules makes it possible to favor penetration of the active agents into the superficial layers of the skin (vehicle effect). The nanoemulsions according to the invention are preferably prepared at temperatures ranging from 4 to 45° C., and so they are compatible with heat-sensitive active agents. These dispersions are described in the following Applications in particular: EP 0728460, EP 0879589, EP 1010413, EP 1010414, EP 1010416, EP 1013338, EP 1016453, EP 1018363, EP 1025898 and EP 1120102. In all of these applications, it is specified that an ionic surfactant will be added to the nonionic surfactant (or mixture) in order to improve the stability of the particles. In the case of the present application, exclusively one or more cationic surfactants will be used as the ionic surfactant. The proportions indicated in the foregoing references are to be adopted and, as an example of cationic surfactants, the list common to all of the particles will be used.

The double stranded RNA oligonucleotides (or else dsRNA for double stranded RNA, siRNA for short interfering RNA) that can be used according to the present invention are double stranded nucleic acid fragments capable of totally or partly inhibiting gene expression in a eukaryotic cell, these double stranded RNA oligonucleotides generally containing between 12 and 40 nucleotides, preferentially from 20 to 25 nucleotides. These double stranded oligonucleotides are composed of one sense strand and one anti-sense strand, corresponding to the sequence of the target messenger RNA to be degraded. The double stranded RNA oligonucleotide has free or unpaired ends of 2 to 6 nucleotides. It will be possible for the double stranded RNA oligonucleotides according to the invention to be double stranded RNA oligonucleotides containing one or more nucleotides modified by substitution, deletion or insertion, and these modifications will be such that the oligonucleotide sequence of the double stranded RNA will permit it to recognize specifically a fragment of the target mRNA of the degradation mechanism. It will also be possible for the oligonucleotides of the double stranded RNA to have a modified skeleton that, for example, imparts better stability to it. For example, the phosphodiester bonds of natural RNA strands can be modified to include at least one nitrogen or sulfur atom. In addition, the double stranded RNA oligonucleotides according to the invention can comprise bases other than the 4 classical bases. The double stranded structure of the double stranded RNA oligonucleotide can be obtained by pairing two complementary single RNA strands or by a unique “self-complementary” single RNA strand, or in other words one comprising two fragments of complementary sequences that can be paired by folding the single strand to form a double helix. Examples of double stranded RNA oligonucleotides are described in International Patent Applications WO 00/44895, WO 01/36646, WO 99/32619, WO 01/29058, WO 00/44914 or else WO 03/101376. They may also be oligonucleotides of the double stranded RNA known as “stealth RNA”, such as those sold by the Invitrogen Co. and described in US Patent Applications 2004014956 and 2004054155, which are oligonucleotides of double stranded RNA that can be modified in such a way that, as a non-limitative example, one of its ends contains a 2′-O-methyl group. The double stranded RNA oligonucleotides can be synthesized manually or automatically by numerous in vivo or in vitro synthesis methods as known in the art. The in vitro synthesis methods can be chemical or enzymatic, for example by using a polymerase RNA (such as T3, T7 or SP6, for example), which will achieve transcription of a chosen DNA (or cDNA) sequence model. Numerous methods for in vivo synthesis of double stranded RNA are described in the literature. They can be achieved in various cellular types of bacteria or higher organisms (Sambrook et al.

The person skilled in the art will choose a double stranded RNA oligonucleotide concentration appropriate for the intended use and the activity of the chosen oligonucleotide. It will be possible, without this being limitative, for the double stranded RNA oligonucleotide concentration to be between 1 nM and 100 mM. The compositions can also contain one or more ingredients, such as carriers, active agents, etc suitable for cosmetic and/or ocular applications. Such ingredients are well-known in the art. A second object of the present invention relates to the topical or ocular use of a composition comprising at least one double stranded RNA oligonucleotide associated with at least one cationic particle of size smaller than or equal to 1 μm, preferably smaller than or equal to 500 nm or 300 nm, of zeta potential between 10 and 80 mV, chosen from among surfactant micelles, block polymer micelles, liposomes of nonionic and cationic surfactants, niosomes, oleosomes, particles of nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, organic particles or inorganic particles for cosmetic purposes. Another object of the present invention relates to a cosmetic treatment method comprising the topical or ocular application of a composition comprising at least one double stranded RNA oligonucleotide and at least one cationic particle of size smallerless than or equal to 1 μm, of zeta potential between 10 and 80 mV, chosen from among surfactant micelles, block polymer micelles, liposomes of nonionic and cationic surfactants, niosomes, oleosomes, particles of nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, organic particles or inorganic particles. For purposes of cosmetic, dermatological, ophthalmic or pharmaceutical care, it is sought to avoid invasive methods such as subcutaneous or ocular injections. The cationic particles associated with the siRNA according to the present invention can be applied topically on the skin, the mucous membranes or in the eye, in suspension or incorporated in an acceptable cosmocentric support, such as lotions, serum, emulsified or non-emulsified gels, oil-in-water, water-in-oil and multiple emulsions, microemulsions, etc. Care will be taken that this introduction into a cosmetic support does not jeopardize the stability of the particles associated with the siRNA. As a non-limitative example, it will be possible to design the composition according to the invention, comprising dsRNA vectorized with cationic particles, to prevent and/or to treat actinic or chronological aging, wrinkles, loss of cutaneous firmness of the skin of the face and/or of the body, seborrheic disorders, greasy skin, dry skin and pigment spots. These compositions can also be designed to slow hair loss, to stimulate hair growth, to improve hair quality, to limit or prevent regrowth of unwanted hair, etc. These compositions can also be designed to treat cutaneous or ophthalmologic disorders. To favor penetration of the particles associated with the siRNA it will be possible to modify the permeability of the skin; thus it is possible to control the permeability of the skin by measuring the IWL (insensible water loss) with a Tewameter TM210 or with a Dermalab of Cortex Technology. As an example, it will be possible to use the following methods: stripping (corneodisk, “varnish”), chemical peeling or mechanical dermabrasion;pretreatment by a mixture of one or more solvents having a delipidating effect;cleaning of the skin by a detergent foaming product;occlusive pre- or post-treatment, for example either by covering the surface of the skin to be treated with an impermeable synthetic membrane (such as Blenderm) or by application of a coat of vaseline. This has the effect of blocking the natural IWL of the skin and causing super-hydration of the epidermal lipids, which thus become more permeable. After application of the composition of the present invention, it will also be possible to use methods known to the person skilled in the art for favoring penetration of molecules into the skin, examples being iontophoresis or electroporation. Finally, the present invention has as an object the use of cationic particles of size smaller than or equal to 1 μm, of zeta potential between 10 and 80 mV, chosen from among surfactant micelles, block polymer micelles, liposomes of nonionic and cationic surfactants, niosomes, oleosomes, particles of nanoemulsions, nanocapsules, organic particles or inorganic particles as agents that favor topical or ocular penetration of at least one double stranded RNA oligonucleotide.

Two phases of growth kinetics of the model were chosen for topical application of the micelle/siRNA complex: 1 application on day 6 of growth of the epidermis, corresponding to an epidermis at the beginning of stratification and keratinization. 1 application on day 13 of growth of the epidermis, corresponding to a stratified and keratinized epidermis. The siRNA chosen is Block-It Fluorescent Oligo (20 μM), such as described in the manual “Block-It Transfection Kit” (Catalog ref. No.: 13750-070, Invitrogen). It is a 25-nucleotide double stranded RNA coupled with fluorescein. The coded sequence has no homology with the human genome, and therefore makes it non-functional. This nucleotide was developed specifically for the study of cell targeting. When it is transfected, it is present in the cytoplasm and also penetrates into the cell nucleus. Preparation of the Micelle/siRNA Complex: 3 μl of Block-It Fluorescent Oligo (20 μM), such as described in the manual “Block-It Transfection Kit” (Catalog ref. No.: 13750-070, Invitrogen), is mixed with 9 μl of cationic micelles E2 (octyl β-glucoside/cetyltriammonium bromide in the molar ratio of 5/1, 50 mM in distilled water). Preparation of the Lipofectamine 2000/siRNA Mixture: 3 μl of Block-It Fluorescent Oligo (20 μM) is diluted in 50 μl of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) and mixed with 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) diluted in 12 μl of OptiMEM according to the supplier's protocol. The solution is incubated at ambient temperature for 20 minutes to permit complexing of the liposomes and of the siRNA. Preparation of Control Solutions: 3 μl of Block-It Fluorescent Oligo (20 μM) is diluted in 9 μl of OptiMEM. 9 μl of cationic micelles E2 (octyl β-glucoside/cetyltriammonium bromide in the molar ratio of 5/1, 50 mM in distilled water) is diluted in 3 μl of OptiMEM. The different mixtures and solutions are then deposited on different samples of EPISKIN epidermis and incubated under immersed conditions for 48 hours at 37° C. in the presence of 5% CO2 in the differentiation medium supplied with the EPISKIN kit. The samples are then frozen in a mixture of dry ice and ethanol and cut into 5 μm sections by means of a cryostat (MICROM HM560). The sections are mounted in Vectrashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) containing 1.5 μg of DAPI and viewed under immunofluorescent conditions with filters appropriate for fluorescein and DAPI. Observations: Epidermis transfected on day 6: it is observed that, although the solution of Block-It Fluorescent Oligo (FIG. 1A) or the mixture of Lipofectamine 2000 (FIG. 1B) does not permit penetration of Block-It Fluorescent Oligo beyond the stratum comeum being formed, the mixture of E2 and Block-It Fluorescent Oligo permits penetration of the RNA duplex into the epidermis (FIGS. 1C, 1E and 1F). No non-specific marking is detected when E2 is applied alone (FIG. 1D). The surprising character of this observation is emphasized by the homogeneous presence of the Block-It Fluorescent Oligo in all cells of the epidermis, whereas it is known by the person skilled in the art that traditional transfection is efficient only in proliferating cells. In the reconstructed epidermis, only the basal cells proliferate, while the supra-basal cells become differentiated. Epidermis transfected on day 13: as on day 6, the solution of Block-It Fluorescent Oligo alone does not penetrate the stratum corneum (FIG. 2A). The mixture of E2 and Block-It Fluorescent Oligo permits penetration of the fluorescent duplex into the different layers of the stratum corneum and into the different cells of the epidermis (FIGS. 2B and 2C), albeit with lower efficiency and homogeneity than on day 6. EXAMPLE 3 Effect of a Formulation of Octyl Glucoside and CTAB in Different Concentrations on the Mortality of HaCaT Cells The effect of formula E2: 50 mM micelles of octyl glucoside/CTAB in 5/1 molar ratio is achieved by incubation for 4 days according to the following protocol on HaCaT cells (500 μl of medium seeded with 40,000 cells per well, B-It: Block-It Fluorescent Oligo (Invitrogen). 40,000 HaCaT cells per well are seeded in duplicate in a 24-well plate in 500 μl of complete DMEM+10% fetal calf serum. 1 μl of Block-It Fluorescent Oligo (Invitrogen) is diluted in 1 to 15 μl of micellar solution E2, composed of 50 mM of micelles of octyl glucoside and CTAB in 5/1 molar ratio and added to the culture medium, bringing the final concentration of micellar solution to 0.1 to 1.5 mM. The cells are then incubated for 4 days at 37° C., the medium for one sample of the duplicates being changed on day 1, after which they are photographed. The results obtained are presented in FIGS. 3A-3H and 4A-4D. No difference is observed between the cells subjected to the same treatment with or without change of medium on day 1. High mortality is observed for micellar solution concentrations below the CMC (approximately 1 mM), revealing the toxic effect of the vehicle in its free form, whereas good cell viability is observed above the CMC (1.5 mM).
