The pigment also finds application in colouring plastics and related materials. The present invention leads to a pigment which resistant to crystal transformation and cryst llisatlon. Copper phthalocyanin blue occurs in more than one crysta!line form. Commercially, however:, only two crystalline forms are important namely the alpha and beta forms. Generally, the alpha form is obtained at lower temperatures and the beta at higher temperatures tabove ]80°C) of preparation. Hitherto, the copper pbthaiocyanin pigment prepared by any of the available method (these are irrelevant to the. present invention as the present invention does not involve prep rat{on the pigment but involves its modification for stability and tinting strength), stable when stored in the original form. However, when it come into contact wltb an organic solvent, as is usually the case in several of its applications, the alpha form undergoes crystalllsatlon and t e beta form transforms to alpha form an subsequently undergoes crystalization, thds leading to loss brightness.
