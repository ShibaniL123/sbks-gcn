The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of carboxamides, in particular to the preparation of phenyl-substituted 3-difluoromethyl-1-methyl-1 H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid methoxy-[1-methyl-2-phenyl-ethyl]-amides. Phenyl-substituted 3-difluoromethyl-1-methyl-1 H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid methoxy-[1-methyl-2-phenyl-ethyl]-amides and their microbiocidal properties are described for example inWO 2010/063700. It is known from WO 2010/063700 to prepare phenyl-substituted 3-difluoromethyl-1-methyl-1 H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid methoxy-[1-methyl-2-phenyl-ethyl]-amides (Ia) according to reaction scheme 1 starting from commercially available 2,4,6-trisubstituted benzoic acid of formula IVa. This starting material is very expensive, in particular if R siginfies chloro, and the known process is therefore less suitable for large-scale production of 3-difluoromethyl-1-methyl-1 H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid methoxy-[1-methyl-2-phenyl-ethyl]-amides. A further disadvantage of this prior art process is the significant number of reaction steps which makes this process uneconomical. The synthesis of the compound of formula IIa, which can be reacted with the corresponding pyrazole derivative to 3-difluoromethyl-1-methyl-1 H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid methoxy-[1-methyl-2-phenyl-ethyl]-amide derivatives (Ia), is described in scheme 1. The disclosed reaction steps are as follows: a) (Va), (Via), (Vila), (VIIIa) and (IXa);b) (Va), (Via), (Vila), (VIIIa), (Xa) and (IXa);c) (Va), (XIa), (XIIa), (Xa) and (IXa) ord) (Va), (XIa), (XIIa), (VIIIa) and (IXa). The aim of the present invention is therefore to provide a novel process for the production of phenyl-substituted 3-difluoromethyl-1-methyl-1 H-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid methoxy-[1-methyl-2-phenyl-ethyl]-amides that avoids the disadvantages of the known process and makes it possible to prepare said compounds in high yields and good quality in an economically advantageous way with less reaction steps. Thus, according to the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of the compound of formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen, halogen or C1-C6alkyl;R2 is hydrogen, halogen, C1-C6alkyl, C2-C6alkenyl, C3-C6alkinyl, C3-C6cycloalkyl-C3-C6alkinyl, halophenoxy, halophenyl-C3-C6alkinyl, C(C1-C4alkyl)=NO-C1-C4alkyl, C1-C6haloalkyl, C1-C6haloalkoxy, C2-C6haloalkenyl or C2-C6haloalkenyloxy; andR3 is hydrogen, halogen or C1-C6alkyl; which process comprises a) adding a compound of formula II wherein R1, R2 and R3 have the meanings as described under formula I, in the presence of an inert organic solvent to a mixture comprising an organic nitrite of formula III R4-O-N=O (III), wherein R4 is C1-C8alkyl, a compound of formula IV and an inert organic solvent;b) reacting the resulting compound of formula V wherein R1, R2 and R3 have the meanings as described under formula I with O-methylhydroxylamine of formula VI H2N-O-CH3 (VI), to the compound of formula VII wherein R1, R2 and R3 have the meanings as described under formula I;c) reducing the compound of formula VII to the compound of formula VIII wherein R1, R2 and R3 have the meanings as described under formula Id) and reacting the compound of formula VIII with a compound of formula IX in which R* is halogen, hydroxy or C1-6 alkoxy, to the compound of formula I.a) WO 00/34229 describes a process for the preparation of a ketone of formula V by diazotizing an aniline of formula II and reacting the resulting diazonium salt with isopropenylacetate of formula IV. A disadvantage of this process is the accumulation of the very reactive diazonium salt in the reaction mixture. Diazonium salts in general are sensitive to physical agents such as heat, light, shock, static electricity and dehydration that can lead to rapid, uncontrollable decompositions and explosions. A further disadvantage is that 2 different equipments are needed to perform the reactions. The process according to the invention uses easily accessible starting material, without the need of isolation or accumulation of diazonium salt and is therefore especially suitable for the large-scale preparation of a compound of formula I. The compound of formula V can be prepared preferably by a one pot reaction adding the aniline of formula II to a mixture of isoprenylacetate of formula IV, an organic nitrite of formula III and a solvent. In preferred compounds of formula III, R4 is C4-C7alkyl. A preferred nitrite is tert-butyl nitrite and tert.-amyl nitrite. The mixture of isoprenylacetate of formula IV, an organic nitrite of formula III and a solvent can additionally contain a copper compound which can be advantageous to increase yield and/or quality of the product. Preferred copper compounds are CuO, CuCl2 or CuSO4. The amount of the copper compounds is preferably is 1-20 mol% in the relation to the aniline of formula II. Advantageous for the reaction is a temperature of -10°C to 50°C. No isolation or accumulation of diazonium salt is required for this process step. Advantageously the same solvent is used for the aniline of formula II and the mixture of isoprenylacetate of formula IV and the organic nitrite of formula III. Suitable inert organic solvents are for example ketones, for example acetone, methylethylketone (MEK) or nitriles, for example acetonitrile. Preferred solvents are acetone and acetonitrile. The reaction without the use of copper can be environmentally more advantageous since copper waste can be avoided. Therefore, this process variant represents one of the preferred embodiments of this invention. The compounds of formula II and III are either known or can be prepared according to methods well known in the art. Some compounds of formula II are commercially available, e.g. the compound of formula II, wherein R1, R2 and R3 is chloro. Isoprenylacetate of formula IV is also commercially available. b) The compound of formula VII can be prepared preferably by a one pot reaction adding a salt of O-methyl-hydroxylamine; preferably the hydrochloride salt as aqueous solution to the compound of formula V in an inert solvent such as methanol or ethanol. Advantageous for this reaction is a temperature of 10- 90°C; preferably 40-60°C. The compound of formula VII can be furthermore purified by extraction into a suitable solvent such as hexane, methylcyclohexane or toluene.c) The compound of formula VIII can be obtained by reduction from the compound of formula VII by treatment with a borane reagent such as sodium cyano borohydride, complexes of borane e.g. complexes of borane with organic amines, such as complexes of borane with triethylamine, trimethylamine, pyridine or 5-ethyl-2-methylpyridine in a suitable solvent such as an organic acid like acetic acid, or such as an organic alcohol like methanol, ethanol or isopropanol and optionally in the presence of a strong acid, such as hydrogen chloride or sulphuric acid. The compound of formula VIII can be also prepared by hydrogenation of a compound of formula VII in the presence of a catalyst containing a transition metal such at Pt in a suitable solvent and and in the presence of at least 1 mol equivalent of a strong acid such as hydrogen chloride or sulphuric acid in a solvent such as an organic alcohol like methanol or acetic acid. Suitable temperatures include -10 to 60°C, preferably -10 to 30°C, and a hydrogen pressure of 0-0.1 MPa; preferably 0.3 - 0.5 MPa in particular 0.1 - 3 MPa, preferably 0.2 - 1 MPa. d) The compound of formula I is prepared by reacting a compound of formula VII with a compound of formula (IX) with an excess of the compound of formula IX, advantageously in a ratio of 1:1 to 1:1.2. R* is preferably chloro. The reaction is advantageously performed in an inert solvent in the presence of a base. Such suitable solvents are for example dichloromethane, xylene, toluene or ethylacetate, preferably xylene. Suitable bases are for example sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxyde, triethylamine or pyridine, especially preferred bases are sodium hydroxyde and triethylamine. The process according to the invention is especially suitable for the production of compounds of formula I, wherein at least one of R1, R2 and R3 is different from hydrogen. The process according to the invention is especially suitable for the preparation of compounds of formula I, wherein at least one of R1, R2 and R3 is halogen. Further compounds of formula I can be advantageously prepared, wherein R1, R2 and R3 are halogen, especially R1, R2 and R3 are chloro.
