Certain compounds of the invention may be obtained as different isomers (e.g., stereoisomers, coordination isomers, linkage isomers, hydrate isomers, and the like). The invention includes isomeric forms of the disclosed compounds and both pure isomers and mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures. Isomers can the separated and isolated using any suitable method, such as chromatography. The compounds of the invention may contain one or more chiral centers and/or double bonds and, therefore, exist as stereoisomers, such as double-bond isomers geometric isomers), enantiomers, or diastereomers. According to this invention, the chemical structures depicted herein, including the compounds of this invention, encompass all of the corresponding compounds' enantiomers, diastereomers and geometric isomers, that is, both the stereochemically pure form (e.g., geometrically pure, enantiomerically pure, or diastereomerically pure) and isomeric mixtures (e.g., enantiomeric, diastereomeric and geometric isomeric mixtures). In some cases, one enantiomer, diastereomer or geometric isomer will possess superior activity or an improved toxicity or kinetic profile compared to other isomers. In those cases, such enantiomers, diastereomers and geometric isomers of compounds of this invention are preferred. As used herein, the term “polymorph” means solid crystalline forms or a compound of the present invention described herein. Different polymorphs of the same compound can exhibit different physical, chemical and/or spectroscopic properties. Different physical properties include, but are not limited to stability (e.g., to heat or light), compressibility and density (important in formulation and product manufacturing), and dissolution rates (which can affect bioavailability). Differences in stability can result from changes in chemical reactivity (e.g., differential oxidation, such that a dosage form discolors more rapidly when comprised of one polymorph than when comprised of another polymorph) or mechanical characteristics (e.g., tablets crumble on storage as a kinetically favored polymorph converts to thermodynamically more stable polymorph) or both (e.g., tablets of one polymorph are more susceptible to breakdown at high humidity). Different physical properties of polymorphs can affect their processing. For example, one polymorph might be more likely to form solvates or might be more difficult to filter or wash free of impurities than another due to, for example, the shape or size distribution of particles of it. As used herein, the term “solvate” means a compound of the present invention described herein, that further includes a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of solvent bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces. As used herein, the term “hydrate” means a compound of the present invention described herein, that further includes a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of water bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces. As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term “prodrug” means a derivative of a compound that can hydrolyze, oxidize, or otherwise react under biological conditions (in vitro or in vivo) to provide a compound of this invention. Prodrugs may become active upon such reaction under biological conditions, or they may have activity in their unreacted forms.

An aliphatic group is a straight chained, branched or cyclic non-aromatic hydrocarbon which is completely saturated or which contains one or more units of unsaturation. Typically, a straight chained or branched aliphatic group has from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to about 10, and a cyclic aliphatic group has from 3 to about 10 carbon atoms, preferably from 3 to about 8. An aliphatic group is preferably a straight chained or branched alkyl group, e.g., methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, pentyl or octyl, or a cycloalkyl group with 3 to about 8 carbon atoms.

Preferably, heteroaryl groups comprise from one to four heteroatoms. Aromatic groups also include fused polycyclic aromatic ring systems in which a carbocyclic aromatic ring or heteroaryl ring is fused to one or more other heteroaryl rings. Examples include benzothienyl, benzofuranyl, indolyl, quinolinyl, benzothiazole, benzooxazole, benzimidazole, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl and isoindolyl. The term “arylene” refers to an aryl group which is connected to the remainder of the molecule by two other bonds. By way of example, the structure of a 1,4-phenylene group is shown below: Substituents for an arylene group are as described below aryl group. Non-aromatic heterocyclic rings are non-aromatic rings which include one or more heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur in the ring. The ring can be five, six, seven or eight-membered. Preferably, heterocyclic groups comprise from one to about four heteroatoms. Examples include tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydrothiophenyl, morpholino, thiomorpholino, pyrrolidinyl, piperazinyl, piperidinyl, and thiazolidinyl. The terms “lower alkoxy”, “lower acyl”, “(lower alkoxy)methyl” and “(lower alkyl)thiomethyl” mean to —O-(lower alkyl), —C(O)-(lower alkyl), —CH2—O-(lower alkyl) and —CH2—S-(lower alkyl), respectively.

The compounds of the invention are administered by any suitable route, including, for example, orally in capsules, suspensions or tablets or by parenteral administration. Parenteral administration can include, for example, systemic administration, such as by intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal injection. The compounds of the invention can also be administered orally (e.g., dietary), topically, by inhalation (e.g., intrabronchial, intranasal, oral inhalation or intranasal drops), or rectally, depending on the type of cancer to be treated. Oral and parenteral administrations are preferred modes of administration. One embodiment of the present invention is a method of treating a subject with a proliferative disorder comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical composition thereof. Cancer, including multidrug resistant cancer, is one type of proliferative disorder that can be treated with the compounds of the invention. Non-malignant proliferative disorders are also included in the invention. “Treating a subject with a cancer” includes achieving, partially or substantially, one or more of the following: arresting the growth or spread of a cancer, reducing the extent of a cancer (e.g., reducing size of a tumor or reducing the number of affected sites), inhibiting the growth rate of a cancer, ameliorating or improving a clinical symptom or indicator associated with a cancer (such as tissue or serum components) and/or reducing the likelihood of the cancer recurring once it has been removed or gone into remission. It has been surprisingly found that the transition metal chelates, coordinates or complexes disclosed herein show sufficient anti-cancer activity to make them suitable for monotherapies, as well as in combination or in co-therapies with other anti-proliferative or anticancer therapies. In particular, it has been found that transition metal chelates, coordinates or complexes of compounds of the aforementioned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,800,660; 6,762,204; 7,037,940; 7,001,923; and 6,924,312 can have sufficient anti-cancer activity to make them suitable for monotherapies, as well as in combination or in co-therapies with other anti-proliferative or anticancer therapies such as paclitaxel. Other anti-proliferative or anticancer therapies may be combined with the compounds or the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention to treat proliferative diseases and cancer. Examples include combination therapy with other anti-cancer drugs, surgery, radiotherapy (including, but not limited to, gamma-radiation, neutron beam radiotherapy, electron beam radiotherapy, proton therapy, brachytherapy, and systemic radioactive isotopes), thermal therapy (see, for example, U.S. Publication No. 2008/0119440, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference) and endocrine therapy. Other anticancer agents that may be used in combination with the compounds or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include biologic response modifiers (including, but not limited to, interferons, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)), hyperthermia and cryotherapy, agents to attenuate any adverse effects (e.g., antiemetics), and other approved chemotherapeutic drugs. Specific examples of anticancer agents are described in detail below. Preferably, the co-administered anti-cancer drug is an agent that stabilizes microtubules, such as paclitaxel or an analog of paclitaxel. Cancers that can be treated or prevented by the methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to human sarcomas and carcinomas, e.g., fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma.

Other examples of leukemias include acute and/or chronic leukemias, e.g., lymphocytic leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by the p388 (murine) cell line), large granular lymphocytic leukemia, and lymphoblastic leukemia; T-cell leukemias, e.g., T-cell leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by the CEM, Jurkat, and HSB-2 (acute), YAC-1 (murine) cell lines), T-lymphocytic leukemia, and T-lymphoblastic leukemia; B cell leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by the SB (acute) cell line), and B-lymphocytic leukemia; mixed cell leukemias, e.g., B and T cell leukemia and B and T lymphocytic leukemia; myeloid leukemias, e.g., granulocytic leukemia, myelocytic leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by the HL-60 (promyelocyte) cell line), and myelogenous leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by the K562 (chronic) cell line); neutrophilic leukemia; eosinophilic leukemia; monocytic leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by the THP-1 (acute) cell line); myelomonocytic leukemia; Naegeli-type myeloid leukemia; and nonlymphocytic leukemia. Other examples of leukemias are described in Chapter 60 of The Chemotherapy Sourcebook, Michael C. Perry Ed., Williams & Williams (1992) and Section 36 of Holland Erie Cancer Medicine 5th Ed., Bast et al. Eds., B. C. Decker Inc. (2000). The entire teachings of the preceding references are incorporated herein by reference. Additional cancers that can be treated or prevented by the methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to oral cavity and pharynx cancers, including tongue, mouth, pharynx, and other oral cavity cancers; digestive system cancers, including esophagus, small intestine, rectum, anus, anal canal, anorectum, liver and intrahepatic bile duct, gallbladder and other biliary, pancreas and other digestive organs; respiratory system cancers, including larynx and bronchus; bone and joint cancers; soft tissue (including heart) cancers; genital system cancers, including uterine cervix, uterine corpus, ovary, vulva, vagina and other genital, female, testis, penis and other genital, male; urinary system cancers, including kidney and renal pelvis, and ureter and other urinary organs; eye and orbit cancers; leukemia, including acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia. In one embodiment, the disclosed method is believed to be particularly effective in treating a subject with non-solid tumors such as multiple myeloma. In another embodiment, the disclosed method is believed to be particularly effective against T-leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by Jurkat and CEM cell lines); B-leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by the SB cell line); promyelocytes (e.g., as exemplified by the HL-60 cell line); uterine sarcoma (e.g., as exemplified by the MES-SA cell line), monocytic leukemia (e.g., as exemplified by the THP-1 (acute) cell line); and lymphoma (e.g., as exemplified by the U937 cell line). In another embodiment, the disclosed method is believed to be particularly effective in treating a subject with melanoma. In another embodiment, the disclosed method is believed to be particularly effective in treating a subject with renal cell carcinoma. The disclosed method is particularly effective at treating subjects whose cancer has become “drug resistant”. A cancer which initially responded to an anti-cancer drug becomes resistant to the anti-cancer drug when the anti-cancer drug is no longer effective in treating the subject with the cancer. For example, many tumors will initially respond to treatment with an anti-cancer drug by decreasing in size or even going into remission, only to develop resistance to the drug. Drug resistant tumors are characterized by a resumption of their growth and/or reappearance after having seemingly gone into remission, despite the administration of increased dosages of the anti-cancer drug. Cancers that have developed resistance to two or more anti-cancer drugs are said to be “multi-drug resistant”. For example, it is common for cancers to become resistant to three or more anti-cancer agents, often five or more anti-cancer agents and at times ten or more anti-cancer agents. Numerous non-cancer diseases involve excessive or hyperproliferative cell growth, termed hyperplasia. As used herein, the terms “proliferative disorder”, “hyperproliferative disorder,” and “cell proliferation disorder” are used interchangeably to mean a disease or medical condition involving pathological growth of cells. Such disorders include cancer. Non-cancerous proliferative disorders include smooth muscle cell proliferation, systemic sclerosis, cirrhosis of the liver, adult respiratory distress syndrome, idiopathic cardiomyopathy, lupus erythematosus, retinopathy, e.g., diabetic retinopathy or other retinopathies, cardiac hyperplasia, reproductive system associated disorders such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and ovarian cysts, pulmonary fibrosis, endometriosis, fibromatosis, harmatomas, lymphangiomatosis, sarcoidosis, desmoid tumors and the like. Smooth muscle cell proliferation includes proliferative vascular disorders, for example, intimal smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, restenosis and vascular occlusion, particularly stenosis following biologically- or mechanically-mediated vascular injury, e.g., vascular injury associated with balloon angioplasty or vascular stenosis. Moreover, intimal smooth muscle cell hyperplasia can include hyperplasia in smooth muscle other than the vasculature, e.g., hyperplasia in bile duct blockage, in bronchial airways of the lung in asthma patients, in the kidneys of patients with renal interstitial fibrosis, and the like. Non-cancerous proliferative disorders also include hyperproliferation of cells in the skin such as psoriasis and its varied clinical forms, Reiters syndrome, pityriasis rubra pilaris, and hyperproliferative variants of disorders of keratinization (e.g., actinic keratosis, senile keratosis), sclerodenua, and the like.

In one embodiment, the compounds of the invention can be used in combination with an immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of a proliferative disorder such as cancer, or to reduce the likelihood of the reoccurrence of a proliferative disorder such as cancer. Immunotherapy (also called biological response modifier therapy, biologic therapy, biotherapy, immune therapy, or biological therapy) is treatment that uses parts of the immune system to fight disease. Immunotherapy can help the immune system recognize cancer cells, or enhance a response against cancer cells. Immunotherapies include active and passive immunotherapies. Active immunotherapies stimulate the body's own immune system while passive immunotherapies generally use immune system components created outside of the body. Examples of active immunotherapies include: cancer vaccines, tumor cell vaccines (autologous or allogeneic), dendritic cell vaccines, antigen vaccines, anti-idiotype vaccines, DNA vaccines, Lymphokine-Activated Killer (LAK) Cell Therapy, or Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) Vaccine with Interleukin-2 (IL 2). Active immunotherapies are currently being used to treat or being tested to treat various types of cancers, including melanoma, kidney (renal) cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, malignant brain tumors, and advanced melanoma. Examples of passive immunotherapies include: monoclonal antibodies and targeted therapies containing toxins. Monoclonal antibodies include naked antibodies and conjugated antibodies (also called tagged, labeled, or loaded antibodies). Naked monoclonal antibodies do not have a drug or radioactive material attached whereas conjugated monoclonal antibodies are joined to a chemotherapy drug (chemolabeled), a radioactive particle (radiolabeled), or a toxin (immunotoxin). A number of naked monoclonal antibody drugs have been approved for treating cancer, including: Rituximab (Rituxat™), a antibody against the CD20 antigen used to treat B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma; Trastuzumab (Herceptin), an antibody against the HER2 protein used to treat advanced breast cancer; Alemtuzumab (Campath), an antibody against the CD52 antigen used to treat B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL); Cetuximab (Erbitux), an antibody against the EGFR protein used in combination with irinotecan to treat advanced colorectal cancer and to treat head and neck cancers; and Bevacizumab (Avastin) which is an antiangiogenesis therapy that works against the VEGF protein and is used in combination with chemotherapy to treat metastatic colorectal cancer. A number of conjugated monoclonal antibodies have been approved for treating cancer, including: Radiolabeled antibody Ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) which delivers radioactivity directly to cancerous B lymphocytes and is used to treat B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma; radiolabeled antibody Tositumomab (Bexxar) which is used to treat certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma; and immunotoxin Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) which contains calicheamicin and is used to treat acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). BL22 is a conjugated monoclonal antibody currently in testing for treating hairy cell leukemia and there are several immunotoxin clinical trials in progress for treating leukemias, lymphomas, and brain tumors. There are also approved radiolabeled antibodies used to detect cancer, including OncoScint for detecting colorectal and ovarian cancers and ProstaScint for detecting prostate cancers. Targeted therapies containing toxins are toxins linked to growth factors and do not contain antibodies. An example of an approved targeted therapy containing toxins is denileukin diftitox (Ontak) which is used to treat a type of skin lymphoma (cutaneous T cell lymphoma). Examples of adjuvant immunotherapies include: cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1-alpha, interleukins (including IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, IL-21, and IL-27), tumor necrosis factors (including TNF-alpha), and interferons (including IFN-beta, and IFN-gamma); aluminum hydroxide (alum); Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG); Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH); Incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA); QS-21; DETOX; Levamisole; and Dinitrophenyl (DNP). Clinical studies have shown that combining IL-2 with other cytokines, such as IFN-alpha, can lead to a synergistic response. Several types of immunotherapies are being used to treat melanoma patients. IFN-alpha and IL-2 are approved for treatment of people with metastatic melanoma. BCG is being tested in combination with melanoma vaccines and other immunotherapies. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes have been shown to shrink melanoma tumors in a phase 1 clinical trial. Human monoclonal antibodies to ganglioside antigens have been shown to regress cutaneous recurrent melanoma tumors. Some autologous and allogeneic tumor cell vaccines, antigen vaccines (including polyvalent antigen vaccines), viral vaccines, and dendritic cell vaccines have also been shown to shrink tumors. Clinical trials continue for these and other melanoma immunotherapies. Melanoma patients with a high IgM response often survive better than those who elicit no or low IgM antibodies (Morton et al., 1992). Combined IL-12/TNF-alpha immunotherapy has been shown to significantly retard tumor growth in three tumor models in mice (B16F10 melanoma, Lewis lung (LL/2) carcinoma and L1 sarcoma) as compared with controls and mice treated with either cytokine alone. IFN-alpha is approved for the treatment of malignant melanoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), hairy cell leukemia, and Kaposi's sarcoma. Several types of immunotherapies are being used to treat patients that have renal cancer. IFN-alpha and IL-2 are approved for treatment of people with metastatic renal (kidney) cancer. A combination therapy using IL-2, interferon, and chemotherapy is being tested for treatment of renal cancer. Treatment with a tumor cell vaccine plus the adjuvant BCG has been shown to shrink tumors in some advanced renal cancer patients. DNA vaccines and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are also being tested as treatments for renal cancer. Chimeric bispecific G250/anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies have been shown to mediate cell lysis of renal cell carcinoma cell lines by cloned human CD8+ T cells or by IL-2 stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. As used herein, a “microtubulin stabilizer” means an anti-cancer agent which acts by arresting cells in the G2-M phases due to stabilization of microtubules. Agents which are microtubulin stabilizers can be used in combination with the compounds of the invention to treat patients having a proliferative disorder such as cancer, or to reduce the likelihood of the reoccurrence of a proliferative disorder such as cancer. Examples of microtubulin stabilizers include paclitaxel and paclitaxel analogs. Additional examples of microtubulin stabilizers included without limitation the following marketed drugs and drugs in development: Discodermolide (also known as NVP-XX-A-296); Epothilones (such as Epothilone A, Epothilone B, Epothilone C (also known as desoxyepothilone A or dEpoA); Epothilone D (also referred to as KOS-862, dEpoB, and desoxyepothilone B); Epothilone E; Epothilone F; Epothilone B N-oxide; Epothilone A N-oxide; 16-aza-epothilone B; 21-aminoepothilone B (also known as BMS-310705); 21-hydroxyepothilone D (also known as Desoxyepothilone F and dEpoF), 26-fluoroepothilone); FR-182877 (Fujisawa, also known as WS-9885B), BSF-223651 (BASF, also known as ILX-651 and LU-223651); AC-7739 (Ajinomoto, also known as AVE-8063A and CS-39.HCl); AC-7700 (Ajinomoto, also known as AVE-8062, AVE-8062A, CS-39-L-Ser.HCl, and RPR-258062A); Fijianolide B; Laulimalide; Caribaeoside; Caribaeolin; Taccalonolide; Eleutherobin; Sarcodictyin; Laulimalide; Dictyostatin-1; Jatrophane esters; and analogs and derivatives thereof.

Paclitaxel, also referred to as “Taxol®”, is a well-known anti-cancer drug which acts by enhancing and stabilizing microtubule formation. The structure of paclitaxel is shown in FIG. 1. Many analogs of paclitaxel are known, including Taxotere®, the structure of which is shown in FIG. 2. Docetaxol is also referred to as “Taxotere®”. The structures of other paclitaxel analogs are shown in FIGS. 3-23. These compounds have the basic taxane skeleton as a common structure feature and have also been shown to have the ability to arrest cells in the G2-M phases due to stabilization of microtubules. Thus, it is apparent from FIGS. 3-23 that a wide variety of substituents can decorate the taxane skeleton without adversely affecting biological activity. It is also apparent that zero, one or both of the cyclohexane rings of a paclitaxel analog can have a double bond at the indicated positions. For clarity purposes, the basic taxane skeleton is shown below in Structural Formula (VI): Double bonds have been omitted from the cyclohexane rings in the taxane skeleton represented by Structural Formula (VI). The basic taxane skeleton can include zero or one double bond in one or both cyclohexane rings, as indicated in FIGS. 3-23 and Structural Formulas (VII) and (VIII) below. A number of atoms have also been omitted from Structural Formula (VI) to indicate sites in which structural variation commonly occurs among paclitaxel analogs. For example, substitution on the taxane skeleton with simply an oxygen atom indicates that hydroxyl, acyl, alkoxy or another oxygen-bearing substituent is commonly found at the site. These and other substitutions on the taxane skeleton can be made without losing the ability to enhance and stabilize microtubule formation. Thus, the term “paclitaxel analog” is defined herein to mean a compound which has the basic taxane skeleton and which promotes microtubule formation. Paclitaxel analogs may be formulated as a nanoparticle colloidal composition to improve the infusion time and to eliminate the need to deliver the drug with Cremophor which causes hypersensitivity reactions in some patients. An example of a paclitaxel analog formulated as a nanoparticle colloidal composition is Abraxane which is a nanopartiele colloidal composition of protein-stabilized paclitaxel that is reconstituted in saline. Typically, the paclitaxel analogs used herein are represented by Structural Formula (VII) or (VIII): R10 is a lower alkyl group, a substituted lower alkyl group, a phenyl group, a substituted phenyl group, —SR19, —NHR19 or —OR19. R11 is a lower alkyl group, a substituted lower alkyl group, an aryl group or a substituted aryl group. R12 is —H, —OH, lower alkyl, substituted lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, substituted lower alkoxy, —O—C(O)-(lower alkyl), —O—C(O)-(substituted lower alkyl), —O—CH2—O-(lower alkyl)-S—CH2—O-(lower alkyl). R13 is —H, —CH3, or, taken together with R14, —CH2—. R14 is —H, —OH, lower alkoxy, —O—C(O)-(lower alkyl), substituted lower alkoxy, —O—C(O)-(substituted lower alkyl), —O—CH2—O—P(O)(OH)2, —O—CH2—O-(lower alkyl), —O—CH2—S-(lower alkyl) or, taken together with R20, a double bond. R15—H, lower acyl, lower alkyl, substituted lower alkyl, alkoxymethyl, alkthiomethyl, —OC(O)—O(lower alkyl), —OC(O)—O(substituted lower alkyl), —OC(O)—NH(lower alkyl) or —OC(O)—NH(substituted lower alkyl). R16 is phenyl or substituted phenyl. R17 is —H, lower acyl, substituted lower acyl, lower alkyl, substituted, lower alkyl, (lower alkoxy)methyl or (lower alkyl)thiomethyl. R18—H, —CH3 or, taken together with R17 and the carbon atoms to which R17 and R18 are bonded, a five or six membered a non-aromatic heterocyclic ring. R19 is a lower alkyl group, a substituted lower alkyl group, a phenyl group, a substituted phenyl group. R20 is —H or a halogen. R21 is —H, lower alkyl, substituted lower alkyl, lower acyl or substituted lower acyl. Preferably, the variables in Structural Formulas (VII) and (VIII) are defined as follows: R10 is phenyl, tert-butoxy, —S—CH2—CH—(CH3)2, —S—CH(CH3)3, —S—(CH2)3CH3, —O—CH(CH3)3, —NH—CH(CH3)3, —CH═C(CH3)2 or para-chlorophenyl; R11 is phenyl, (CH3)2CHCH2—, -2-furanyl, cyclopropyl or para-toluoyl; R12 is —H, —OH, CH3CO— or —(CH2)2—N-morpholino; R13 is methyl, or, R13 and R14, taken together, are —CH2—; R14 is —H, —CH2SCH3 or —CH2—O—P(O)(OH)2; R15 is CH3CO—; R16 is phenyl; R17—H, or, R17 and R18, taken together, are —O—CO—O—; R18 is —H; R20 is —H or —F; and R21 is —H, —C(O)—CHBr—(CH2)13—CH3 or —C(O)—(CH2)14—CH3; —C(O)—CH2—CH(OH)—COOH, —C(O)—CH2—O—C(O)—CH2CH(NH2)—CONH2, —C(O)—CH2—O—CH2CH2OCH3 or —C(O)—O—C(O)—CH2CH3. A paclitaxel analog can also be bonded to or be pendent from a pharmaceutically acceptable polymer, such as a polyacrylamide. One example of a polymer of this type is shown in FIG. 24. The term “paclitaxel analog”, as it is used herein, includes such polymers. In some embodiments, paclitaxel analogs have a taxane skeleton represented by Structural Formula IX, wherein W is O, S, or NR. Paclitaxel analogs that have the taxane skeleton shown in Structural Formula IX can have various substituents attached to the taxane skeleton and can have a double bond in zero, one or both of the cyclohexane rings as shown, for example in FIGS. 3-23. Various paclitaxel analogs and paclitaxel formulations are described in Hennenfent et al. (2006)Annals of Oncology 17:735-749; Gradishar (2006)Expert Opin. Pharmaeother. 7(8):1041-53; Attard et. al.

In co-therapy in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents (e.g., paclitaxel or paclitaxel analogs), the compound or the pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein can be administered simultaneously or separately with the other therapeutic agent(s). The exact details of the administration will depend on the pharmacokinetics of the two substances in the presence of each other, and can include administering two substances substantially at the same time, and one substance within a certain time period (e.g., within 24 hours) of administration of the other, if the pharmacokinetics are suitable. Designs of suitable dosing regimens are routine for one skilled in the art. In particular embodiments, two substances will be administered substantially simultaneously, i.e. within minutes of each other, or in a single composition that comprises both substances. In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of treating a subject with a Hsp70-responsive disorder. The method comprises administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical composition describe herein. As used herein, “Hsp70” includes each member of the family of heat shock proteins having a mass of about 70-kiloDaltons, including forms such as constituitive, cognate, cell-specific, glucose-regulated, inducible, etc. Examples of specific Hsp70 proteins include hsp70, hsp70hom; hsc70; (Grp78/BiP; mt-hsp70/Grp75, and the like). Typically, the disclosed methods increase expression of inducible Hsp70. Functionally, the 70-kDa HSP (HSP70) family is a group of chaperones that assist in the folding, transport, and assembly of proteins in the cytoplasm, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum. In humans, the Hsp70 family encompasses at least 11 genes encoding a group of highly related proteins. See, for example, Tavaria, et al., Cell Stress Chaperones, 1996; 1(1):23-28; Todryk, et al., Immunology. 2003, 110(1): 1-9; and Georgopoulos and Welch, Annu Rev Cell Biol. 1993; 9:601-634; the entire teachings of these documents are incorporated herein by reference. As used herein, an “Hsp70-responsive disorder” is a medical condition wherein stressed cells can be treated by increased Hsp70 expression. Such disorders can be caused by a wide variety of cellular stressors, including, but not limited to Alzheimer's disease; Huntington's disease; Parkinson's disease; spinal/bulbar muscular atrophy (e.g., Kennedy's disease), spinocerebellar ataxic disorders, and other neuromuscular atrophies; familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; ischemia; seizure; hypothermia; hyperthermia; burn trauma; atherosclerosis; radiation exposure; glaucoma; toxin exposure; mechanical injury; inflammation; autoimmune disease; infection (bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic); and the like. In some embodiments, the Hsp70-responsive disorder is a neurodegenerative disorder. As used herein, a neurodegenerative disorder involves degradation of neurons such as cerebral, spinal, and peripheral neurons (e.g., at neuromuscular junctions), more typically degradation of cerebral and spinal neurons, or in preferred embodiments, degradation of cerebral neurons. Neurodegenerative disorders can include Alzheimer's disease; Huntington's disease; Parkinson's disease; spinal/bulbar muscular atrophy and other neuromuscular atrophies; and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or other diseases associated with superoxide dismutase (SOD) mutations. Neurodegenerative disorders can also include degradation of neurons caused by ischemia, seizure, thermal stress, radiation, toxin exposure, infection, injury, and the like. In some embodiments, the Hsp70-responsive disorder is a disorder of protein aggregation/misfolding, such as Alzheimer's disease; Huntington's disease; Parkinson's disease; spongiform encephalopathies; and the like. In another embodiment the Hsp70-responsive disorder is a treatment or condition which causes or may cause nerve damage. The compounds for use in the methods of the present invention can be used to reduce or prevent (inhibit the onset of) nerve damage (i.e., provide neuroprotection) in a subject i) suffering from a condition which causes or may cause nerve damage or ii) receiving treatment which causes or may cause nerve damage. In one aspect, the treatment which causes or may cause nerve damage is radiation therapy. In another aspect, the treatment is chemotherapy. In one aspect, the chemotherapy comprises administering an antimitotic agent (e.g. vincristine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, or a paclitaxel analog). In one aspect, the chemotherapy comprises administering paclitaxel. En another aspect, the chemotherapy comprises administering a platinum derivative (e.g. cisplatin, carboplatin, or oxaliplatin). In certain embodiments, the compounds for use in the methods of the present invention can be administered simultaneously as a combination therapy with the treatment which causes or may cause nerve damage. In other embodiments the compounds for use in the methods of the present invention can be administered before or after the treatment which causes may cause nerve damage.

In some embodiments, the HSP70-responsive disorder is ischemia. Ischemia can damage tissue through multiple routes, including oxygen depletion, glucose depletion, oxidative stress upon reperfusion, and/or glutamate toxicity, and the like. Ischemia can result from an endogenous condition (e.g., stroke, heart attack, and the like), from accidental mechanical injury, from surgical injury (e.g., reperfusion stress on transplanted organs), and the like. Alternatively, tissues that can be damaged by ischemia include neurons, cardiac muscle, liver tissue, skeletal muscle, kidney tissue, pulmonary tissue, pancreatic tissue, and the like. In one preferred embodiment, the Hsp70-responsive disorder is cerebral or spinal ischemia. In another preferred embodiment, the Hsp70-responsive disorder is cardiac ischemia. In various embodiments, the Hsp70-responsive disorder is seizure, e.g., epileptic seizure, injury-induced seizure, chemically-induced seizure, and the like. In some embodiments, the Hsp70-responsive disorder is due to thermal stress. Thermal stress includes hyperthermia (e.g., from fever, heat stroke, burns, and the like) and hypothermia. In a preferred embodiment the disorder is hyperthermia. In another preferred embodiment, the Hsp70-responsive disorder is burn trauma.

In various embodiments, the Hsp70-responsive disorder is exposure to a toxin. In preferred embodiments, the Hsp70-responsive disorder is exposure to a neurotoxin selected from methamphetamine; antiretroviral HIV therapeutics (e.g., nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; heavy metals (e.g., mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium, compounds thereof, and the like), amino acid analogs, chemical oxidants, ethanol, glutamate, metabolic inhibitors, antibiotics, and the like. The present invention also provides a method of treating a subject with a natural killer, cell-responsive disorder, wherein the method comprises administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical composition describe herein. Certain compounds of the invention also increase Natural Killer (NK) cell activity. As used herein, a “NK cell-responsive disorder” is a medical condition which is improved by an increased in NK cell activity. For example, a subject with a NK cell-responsive disorder may need immune system augmentation because of infection or the possibility thereof. In some embodiments, such a subject can have an infection (or has been exposed to an infectious environment where pathogens are present, e.g., in a hospital) the symptoms of which may be alleviated by the methods disclosed herein. For example, a subject in need of treatment can have an infection (bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitical (protozoal) for which the disclosed methods of activating NK cells can be a treatment. In some embodiments, a subject having an NK cell-responsive disorder has an immunodeficiency. Such a subject is in need of or can benefit from prophylactic therapy, for example, a subject that has incomplete, damaged or otherwise compromised defenses against infection, or is subject to an infective environment, or the like. For example, a subject can be in an infectious environment where pathogens are present, e.g., in a hospital; can have an open wound or burn injury; can have an inherited or acquired immune deficiency (e.g., severe combined immunodeficiency or “bubble boy” syndrome, variable immunodeficiency syndrome acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or the like); can have a depressed immune system due to physical condition, age, toxin exposure, drug effect (immunosuppressants, e.g., in a transplant recipient) or side effect (e.g., due to an anticancer agent); or the like. In some embodiments, NK cell activity can be increased in subjects that have decreased or deficient NK cell activity, in conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome (chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome) or Epstein-Barr virus infection, post viral fatigue syndrome, post-transplantation syndrome (especially allogeneic transplants) or host-graft disease, exposure to drugs such as anticancer agents or nitric oxide synthase inhibitors, natural aging, and various immunodeficient conditions such as severe combined immunodeficiency, variable immunodeficiency syndrome, and the like. In some embodiments, a subject having an NK cell-responsive disorder is in need of treatment for bacteremia. Bactercmia is the condition of bacterial infection in the bloodstream. Septic shock includes serious localized or bacteremic infection accompanied by systemic inflammation, in other words sepsis with hypoperfusion and hypotension refractory to fluid therapy. Sepsis, or systemic inflammatory response syndrome, includes various severe conditions such as infections, pancreatitis, burns, trauma) that can cause acute inflammation. Septic shock is typically related to infections by gram-negative organisms, staphylococci, or meningoeocci. Septic shock can be characterized by acute circulatory failure, typically with hypotension, and multiorgan failure. Transient bacteremia can be caused by surgical or trauma wounds. Gram-negative bacteremia can be intermittent and opportunistic; although it may have no effect on a healthy person, it may be seriously important in immunocompromised patients with debilitating underlying diseases, after chemotherapy, and in settings of malnutrition. The infection can typically be in the lungs, in the genitouritory (GU) or gastrointestinal (GI) tract, or in soft tissues, e.g., skin in patients with decubitus ulcer, oral ulcers in patients at risk, and patients with valvular heart disease, prosthetic heart valves, or other implanted prostheses. Typically, gram-negative bacteremia can manifest in chronically ill and immunocompromised patients. Also in such patients, bloodstream infections can be caused by aerobic bacilli, anaerobes, and fungi. Bacteroides can lead to abdominal and pelvic infective complications, especially in females. Transient or sustained bactercmia can typically result in metastatic infection of the meninges or serous cavities, such as the pericardium or larger joints. Enterococcus, staphylococcus, or fungus can lead to endocarditis, but is less common with gram-negative bacteremia. Staphylococcal bacteremia can be typical of IV drug users, and can be a typical cause of gram-positive bacterial endocarditis. The incidence of systemic fungal infections has undergone a significant increase, particularly in humans, due in part to increases in the number of subjects with compromised immune systems, for example, the elderly, AIDS patients, patients undergoing chemotherapy, burn patients, patients with diabetic ketoaeidosis, and transplant patients on immunosuppressive drugs. A study found that about 40% of deaths from infections acquired during hospitalization were due to mycoses; see Sternberg et. al, Science, Vol. 266, (1994), pp. 1632-1634, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. In various embodiments, the subject having an NK cell-responsive disorder can be in need of treatment for a fungal infection, such as a pathogenic dermatophyte, a pathogenic filamentous fungus, and/or a pathogenic non-filamentous fungus, e.g., a yeast, or the like. Pathogenic dermatophytes can include, e.g., species of the genera Trichophyton, Tinea, Microsporum, Epidermophyton, or the like. Pathogenic filamentous fungus can include, e.g., species of genera such as Aspergillus, Histoplasma, Cryptococcus, Microsporum, or the like.

Compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be particularly useful for treating a subject with an intracellular infection. It is generally believed in the art that NK cells are particularly effective against intracellular infections. Intracellular infections are those wherein a portion of the infecting pathogen resides within cells of the subject. For example, intracellular infections can be caused by one or more bacteria selected from: Ehrlichia (e.g., obligate, intracellular bacteria that can appear as small cytoplasmic inclusions in lymphocytes and neutrophils such as Ehrlichia sennetsu, Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Ehrlichia phagocytophilia, or the like); Listeria (e.g., Listeria monocytogenes), Legionella (e.g., Legionella pneumophila); Rickettsiae (e.g., Rickettsiae prowazekii, Rickettsiae typhi (Rickettsiae mooseri), Rickettsiae rickettsii,Rickettsiae tsutsugamushi, Rickettsiae sibirica; Rickettsiae australis; Rickettsiae conorii; Rickettsiae akari; Rickettsiae burnetii); Chlamydia (e.g., Chlamydia psittaci; Chlamydia pneumoniae; Chlamydia trachomatis, or the like); Mycobacterium (Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Mycobacterium marinum; Mycobacterium Avium Complex; Mycobacterium bovis; Mycobacterium scrofulaceum; Mycobacterium ulcerans; Mycobacterium leprae (Leprosy, Hansen's Bacillus)); Brucella (e.g., Brucella melitensis; Brucella abortus; Brucella suis; Brucella canis); genus Coxiella (e.g., Coxiella burnetii); or the like.

The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be particularly effective for treating a subject with a viral infection.

It is believed that the methods can be particularly effective for treating a subject with a parasitic infection. Thus, in various embodiments, a subject having an NK cell-responsive disorder can be in need of treatment for an infection from Plasmodia (e.g., Plasmodia falciparum, Plasmodia vivax, Plasmodia ovale, and Plasmodia malariae, typically transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes); Leishmania (transmitted by sandflies and caused by obligate intracellular protozoa, e.g., Leishmania donovani, Leishmania infantum, Leishmania chagasi, Leishmania mexicana, Leishmania amazonensis, Leishmania venezuelensis, Leishmania tropica; Leishmania major; Leishmania aethiopica; and the subgenus Viannia, Leishmania Viannia braziliensis, Leishmania Viannia guyanensis, Leishmania Viannia panamensis, and Leishmania Viannia peruviana); Trypanosoma (e.g., sleeping sickness caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense); amoebas of the genera Naegleria or Acanthamoeba; pathogens such as genus Entamoeba (Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba dispar); Giardia lamblia; Cryptosporidium; Isospora; Cyclospora; Microsporidia; Ascaris lumbricoides; infection with blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma (e.g.; S. haematobium; S. mansoni; S. japonicum; S. mekongi; S. intercalatum); Toxoplasmosis (e.g., Toxoplasma gondii); Treponema pallidum; Trichomonas vaginalis; or the like. In some embodiments, the subject having an NK cell-responsive disorder can have an infection caused by a protozoa selected from Toxoplasma gondii, Trypcinosoma brucei gambiense, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, Leishmania donovani, Leishmania infantum, Leishmania chagasi, Leishmania mexicana, Leishmania amazonensis, Leishmania venezuelensis, Leishmania tropica; Leishmania major; Leishmania aethiopica; and the subgenus Viannia, Leishmania Viannia braziliensis, Leishmania Viannia guyanensis, Leishmania Viannia panamensis, Leishmania Viannia peruviana, Plasmodia falciparum, Plasmodia vivax, Plasmodia ovale, and Plasmodia malariae. In the last century, antibiotics were developed that led to significant reductions in mortality. Unfortunately, widespread use has led to the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria, e.g., methicillin resistant Staphyloccocus aureus(MRSA), vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE), and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP). Some bacteria are resistant to a range of antibiotics, e.g., strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resist isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, streptomycin, ethionamide, kanamycin, and rifabutin. In addition to resistance, global travel has spread relatively unknown bacteria from isolated areas to new populations. Furthermore, there is the threat of bacteria as biological weapons. These bacteria may not be easily treated with existing antibiotics. The compounds or the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be particularly effective for treating a subject for drug-resistant pathogens, for example, drug resistant bacteria, or pathogens for which no drugs are available, e.g., many viruses. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that because the compounds of the invention can act by increasing NK cell activity, and thus the NK cells can kill infective microorganisms or infected cells separately from any direct action of the compounds on the pathogen or infected cells. Thus, it is believed that the compounds of the invention can have at least one mode of action that is separate from typical anti-infective drugs such as antibiotics which can typically act directly on the bacteria themselves. Drug resistant pathogens can be resistant to at least one and typically multiple agents, for example, drug resistant bacteria can be resistant to one antibiotic, or typically at least two antibiotics such as penicillin, Methicillin, second generation cephalosporins cefuroxime, and the like), macrolides, tetracyclines, trimethoprim/methoxazole, vancomycin, or the like. For example, in some embodiments, a subject can be treated for bacteria selected from a strain of multiple drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP, previously known as penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, PRSP), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, penicillin resistant Pneumococcus, antibiotic resistant Salmonella, resistant and multi-resistant Neisseria Gonorrhea (e.g., resistant to one, two or more of tetracycline, penicillin, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, ceftriaxone (Rocephin), Cefixime (Suprax), Azithromycin, or the like), and resistant and multi-resistant Tuberculosis (e.g., resistant to one, two or more of Isoniazid, Rifampin, Ethambutol, Pyrazinamide, Aminoglycoside, Capreomycin, Ciprofloxacin, Ofloxacin, gemifloxacin, Cycloserine, Ethionamide, para-aminosalicylic acid or the like). In some embodiments, NK cell activity can be increased in subjects that have an immunodeficiency. In various embodiments, this can be due to decreased or deficient NK cell activity. In some embodiments, the immunodeficiency can be any known immunodeficiency, even those that do not directly impact NK cells. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that boosting NK cell activity can augment immune function in many immunodeficiency conditions to “make-up” at least in part, for aspects of immunodeficiency separate from those aspects directly concerned with NK cell activity. In various embodiments, immunodeficiency disorders can include disorders with increased susceptibility to infection, for example, one or more disorders selected from: circulatory and systemic disorders (sickle cell disease, diabetes mellitus, nephrosis, varicose veins, congenital cardiac defects); obstructive disorders (ureteral or urethral stenosis, bronchial asthma, bronchiectasis, allergic rhinitis, blocked Eustachian tubes); integumentary defects (eczema, burns, skull fractures, midline sinus tracts, ciliary abnormalities); primary immunodeficiencies (X-linked agammaglobulinemia, DiGeorge anomaly, chronic granulomatous disease, C3 deficiency); secondary immunodeficiencies (malnutrition, prematurity, lymphoma, splenectomy, uremia, immunosuppressive therapy, protein-losing enteropathy, chronic viral diseases); unusual microbiologic factors (antibiotic overgrowth, chronic infections with resistant organism, continuous reinfection (contaminated water supply, infectious contact, contaminated inhalation therapy equipment)); foreign bodies, trauma (ventricular shunts, central venous catheter, artificial heart valves, urinary catheter, aspirated foreign bodies) allogeneic transplant, graft-versus-host disease, uterine dysfunction (e.g., endometriosis), or the like.

Typically, such a wound or burn is a severe injury that places a significant burden on the subject's immune defenses. For example, in some embodiments, the subject is treated for a second or third degree burn covering at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 75%, or more of the surface area of the subject's body. Also, in some embodiments, the subject is treated for a wound or wounds, e.g., an open wound of at least about 1 cm2, 2 cm2, 5 cm2, 10 cm2, 20 cm2, 50 cm2 or larger, or 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 10%, 15%, or more of the surface area of the subject's body; or one or more incisions penetrating the skin totaling at least 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm, 7 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 25 cm, 50 cm in length; an amputation; and the like. In various embodiments, the subject having an NK cell-responsive disorder can have an infection caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. In some embodiments, the subject can have an infection caused by a bacterium selected from multiple drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus Aureus, penicillin resistant Pneumococcus, antibiotic resistant Salmonella, resistant/multi-resistant Neisseria Gonorrhea, and resistant/multi-resistant Tuberculosis.

In some embodiments, immunodeficiency disorders can include uremia, diabetes (infective complications thereof, malnutrition, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, protein-losing enteropathies, nephrotic syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, sickle cell disease; or the like.

A “subject” is a mammal, preferably a human, but can also be an animal in need of veterinary treatment, e.g., companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats, and the like), farm animals (e.g., cows, sheep, pigs, horses, and the like) and laboratory animals (e.g., rats, mice, guinea pigs, and the like). Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents may contain inert ingredients which do not inhibit the biological activity of the compounds described herein. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents should be biocompatible, i.e., non-toxic, non-inflammatory, non-immunogenic and devoid of other undesired reactions upon the administration to a subject. Standard pharmaceutical formulation techniques can be employed, such as those described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. Formulation of the compound to be administered will vary according to the route of administration selected (e.g., solution, emulsion, capsule). Suitable pharmaceutical carriers for parenteral administration include, for example, sterile water, physiological saline, bacteriostatic saline (saline containing about 0.9% mg/ml benzyl alcohol), phosphate-buffered saline, Flank's solution, Ringer's-lactate and the like. Methods for encapsulating compositions (such as in a coating of hard gelatin or cyclodextrins) are known in the art (Baker, et al., “Controlled Release of Biological Active Agents”, John Wiley and Sons, 1986). An “effective amount” is the quantity of compound in which a beneficial clinical outcome is achieved when the compound is administered to a subject. For example, when a compound of the invention is administered to a subject with a cancer, a “beneficial clinical outcome” includes a reduction in tumor mass, a reduction in metastasis, a reduction in the severity of the symptoms associated with the cancer and/or an increase in the longevity of the subject compared with the absence of the treatment. When a compound of the invention is administered to a subject with a an Hsp70-responsive disorder or an NK cell-responsive disorder, a “beneficial clinical outcome” includes reduction in the severity or number of symptoms associated with the disorder, elimination of an infection, or increase in the longevity of the subject compared with the absence of the treatment. The precise amount of compound administered to a subject will depend on the type and severity of the disease or condition and on the characteristics of the subject, such as general health, age, sex, body weight and tolerance to drugs. It may also depend on the degree, severity and type of cancer. The skilled artisan will be able to determine appropriate dosages depending on these and other factors. Effective amounts of the disclosed compounds typically range between about 1 mg/mm2 per day and about 10 grams/mm2 per day, and preferably between 10 mg/mm2 per day and about 5 grams/mm2. In some embodiments, effective amounts of the disclosed compounds include microgram to milligram amounts of the compound per kilogram of subject or sample weight (e.g., about 1 μg/kg to about 500 mg/kg, about 500 μg/kg to about 250 mg/kg, about 1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, about 10 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, and the like). When co-administered with another anti-cancer agent for the treatment of cancer, an “effective amount” of the second anti-cancer agent will depend on the type of drug used. Suitable dosages are known for approved anti-cancer agents and can be adjusted by the skilled artisan according to the condition of the subject, the type of cancer being treated and the compound of the invention being used. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein is administered by any suitable route, including, for example, orally in capsules, suspensions or tablets or by parenteral administration. Parenteral administration can include, for example, systemic administration, such as by intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal injection. The compound and pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein can also be administered orally (e.g., dietary), topically, by inhalation (e.g., intrabronchial, intranasal, oral inhalation or intranasal drops), or rectally, depending on the type of cancer to be treated.

Cells were cultured at 37° C. under 5% CO2-95% air. After 16 hours of incubation, the test compound was added to the cell culture. The compound was first diluted in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 400-fold of final concentrations actually used in the assay. The DMSO solution was next diluted 20 fold with the culture medium, and then finally added to the assay wells at another 20-fold dilution. The assay medium included the test compound with concentrations as indicated with 0.25% DMSO. Cell viability was measured with a CCK8 assay (as described in the Technical Manual for Cell Counting Kit-8, Product #CK04-11, CK04-13 and CK04-20, Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.

Hsps can protect the cell from apoptotic death. Agents that induce the production of Hsp70 can have protective activity against a wide range of insults, and may have particular utility in neurological disorders. The neuroprotectant activity of Hsp70 inducing compounds of the invention can be assessed in a variety of animal neurological disease models. Specifically, animal models of stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease are appropriate settings for testing efficacy. Some example animal models are provided below. Example 3 Cerebral Ischemia (Stroke) The benefit of the disclosed treatment with Hsp70 inducing compounds of the invention can be assessed in rodent models of stroke. For example the stroke model described in Longa, et al. (Longa, E. Z., Weinstein, P. R., Carlson, S., and Cummins, R. (1989) Reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion without craniectomy in rats. Stroke 20:84-91) can be utilized. Rats are anesthetized with ketamine, and then infarction is induced by extracranial vascular occlusion. A 4-0 nylon intraluminal suture is placed into the cervical internal carotid artery and is advanced intracranially to block blood flow into the middle cerebral artery. Collateral blood flow is reduced by interrupting all branches of the external carotid artery and all extracranial branches of the internal carotid artery. A compounds of the invention can be dosed just prior to or just after induction of the infarction. The dose may be, for example, 10 to 100 mg/kg body weight administered once per week, three times per week, or daily by any conventional mode of administration, e.g., orally or intravenously. Neurologic deficit, mortality, gross pathology (infarction size), and histochemical staining can be analyzed to assess efficacy of the compounds. Since this is a very acute model, and death is often observed by three days after infarction, the modeling may consist of only a single administration of drug. Example 4 Familial Amyotrophi Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) The efficacy of compounds of the invention in the treatment of ALS can be modeled using the SOD1 transgenic mouse model (Gurney, M. E., Pu, Chiu, A. Y., Dal Canto, M. C., Polchow, C. Y., Alexander, D. D., Caliendo, J., Hentati, A., Kwon, Y. W., and Deng, H. X. (1994) Motor neuron degeneration in mice that express a human CuZn superoxide dismutase mutation. Science 264:1772-1775). Mutations of human CuZn superoxide dismutase (SOD) are found in patients with familial ALS. Expression of the human SOD gene containing a substitution of glycine-to-alanine at amino acid 93 leads to motor neuron disease in transgenic mice. As a result of motor neuron loss from the spinal cord, the mice became paralyzed and die by 5 to 6 months of age. To test the efficacy of the Hsp70 inducing compounds of the invention, transgenic mice having the SOD1 mutation (SOD1G93A) are treated with the compounds, and the effect on disease is monitored. The symptoms are clinically apparent in these animals at 2.5 to 3 months of age. Compounds can be dosed starting at this time. The dose may be, for example, 10 to 100 mg/kg body weight administered once per week or three times per week by the oral or intravenous route. Endpoints include functional impairment of motor function as well as histological changes. The latter endpoints include histopathology of brain and spinal cord assessing degeneration of motor neurons and the appearance of neurofilament-rich inclusions in spinal motor neurons. If long-term administration is performed, the impact on mouse survival can be assessed. Example 5 Huntington's Disease (HD) A transgenic mouse model of HD exists, allowing the testing of Hsp70 inducing compounds of the invention for efficacy in this disease setting (Mangiarini, L., Sathasivam, K., Seller, M., Cozens, B., Harper, A., Hetherington, C., Lawton, M., Trottier, Y., Lehrach, H., Davies, S. W., and Bates, G. P. (1996) Exon 1 of the HD gene with an expanded CAG repeat is sufficient to cause a progressive neurological phenotype in transgenic mice. Cell 87:493-506; Carter, R. J., Lione, L. A., Humby, Mangiarini, L., Mahal, A., Bates, G. P., Dunnett, S. B., and Morton, A. J. (1999) Characterization of progressive motor deficits in mice transgenic for the human Huntington's disease mutation. J. Neuroscience 19:3248-3257). HD is caused by a CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion. These transgenic mice (R6/2 transgenics) have the 5′ end of the human HD gene with (CAG)115-(CAG)150 repeat expansions. The mice exhibit progressive neurological pathologies similar to HD, including abnormal and involuntary movements, tremors, and epileptic seizures. These transgenic mice show overt behavioral changes at approximately 8 weeks of age. As early as 5 to 6 weeks of age, they display more subtle deficiencies in motor skills. Hsp70-inducing compounds of the invention can be administered by intravenous or oral administration at doses of 10-100 mg per kg of body weight starting at various times (for example, at 5 to 6 weeks of age). Compounds can be given on multiple different dosing schedules (e.g., once per week versus three times per week). Performance on one or more rodent motor tests such as swimming tank, beam walking, rotarod apparatus, and footprint test (see Carter, et al., 1999) can be performed to assess the activity of the compounds in preventing loss of neurological function in HD mice. Example 6 Parkinson's Disease (PD) There are two widely employed models of PD in which disease is induced by chemical treatment. These are the 6-OHDA (Zigmond, M. J. and Stricker, E. M. (1984) Parkinson's disease: studies with an animal model. Life Sci. 35:5-18; Sauer, H. and Oertel, W. H. (1994) Progressive degeneration of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons following intrastriatal terminal lesions with 6-hydroxydopamine: a combined retrograde tracing and in immunocytochemical study in the rat. Neuroscience 59:401-415) and the MPTP (Langston, J. W., Forno, L. S., Rebert, C. S., and Irwin, I. (1984) Selective nigral toxicity after systemic administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyrine (MPTP) in the squirrel monkey. Brain Res. 292:390-4) models. An example of a test of Hsp70 inducing compounds of the invention using the 6-OHDA is described. Young adult male rats are injected with Fluoro-Gold (FG) by stereotactic injection into the striatum in the brain in order to facilitate visualization of the neurons in the substantia nigra, the site of PD. Under anesthesia, 0.2 μl of a 4% solution of FG is administered by stereotactic injection (1 mm anterior from bregma, 3 mm lateral, and 4.5 mm ventral from dura into both striata). One week after FG injection, the rats receive a stereotactic injection of 6-OHDA (20 μg dissolved in 4 μl saline; Sigma) into the striatum on one side of the brain, at the same coordinates as the FG injection. Hsp70 inducing compounds of the invention can be administered by intravenous or oral administration at doses of 10-100 mg per kg of body weight. The compounds can be given at the time of 6-OHDA injection or some time (2-4 weeks, for example) subsequent to 6-OHDA treatment. Rats are sacrificed 8 and 16 weeks after 6-OHDA injection. The endpoints of this model are 1) behavioral changes as monitored in-life at various times by assessment of turning (rotational) behavior using classical neurological read-out, and 2) the brain is removed after sacrifice, thin sections are made using a cryostat, and immunohistochemistry is performed as described in Zigmond and Stricker (1984). Efficacy of the Hsp70 inducing compounds of the invention is demonstrated by a decrease in rotational behavior as well as a reduction in the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Example 7 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) There are several transgenic mouse models of AD. One such model that is widely used to test the efficacy of drugs in AD was described by Holcomb, et al. (Holcomb, L., Gordon, M. N., McGowan, E., Yu, X., Benkovic, S., Jantzen, P., Wright, K., Saad, I., Mueller, R., Morgan, D., Sanders, S., Zehr, O'Campo, Hardy, J., Prada, C. M., Eckman, C., Younkin, S., Hsiao, K., and Duff, K. (1998) Accelerated Alzheimer-type phenotype in transgenic mice carrying both mutant amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 transgenes. Nature Medicine 4:97-100). This model contains two different genes associated with AD. One is a mutation in the amyloid precursor protein (APP), The mutant APP (K670N, M671L) transgenic line, Tg2576, has elevated amyloid beta-protein levels at an early age, and, later, develops extracellular AD-type A beta deposits in the brain. The other gene is a mutated presenilin-1 (PS1) gene. The doubly transgenic progeny from across between Tg2576 and the PS1 mutant PS1M146L, transgenic line develop large numbers of fibrillar A beta deposits in cerebral cortex and hippocampus far earlier than their singly transgenic Tg2576 mice. Hsp70 inducing compounds of the invention can be dosed in mice at various times. The age of mice at the start of drug dosing may be varied. For example, a treatment starting time may be at 3 months of age, a time at which the brain deposits are first detectable. The dose may be, for example, 10 to 100 mg/kg body weight administered once per week or three times per week by the oral or intravenous route. The effect of drug treatment can be assessed by measuring AD-type deposits in the brain as well as by assessing function of the mice in a maze test. Example 8 Measurement of Heat Shock Protein 70 (Hsp70) Plasma Hsp70 can be measured by a sandwich ELISA kit (Stressgen Bioreagents Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA) according to a modified protocol in house. In brief, Hsp70 in plasma specimens and serial concentrations of Hsp70 standard are captured onto 96-well plate on which anti-Hsp70 antibody was coated. Then captured Hsp70 is detected with a biotinylated anti-Hsp70 antibody followed by incubation with europium-conjugated streptavidin. After each incubation unbound materials are removed by washing. Finally, antibody-Hsp70 complex was measured by time resolved fluorometry of europium. Concentration of Hsp70 is calculated from a standard curve. Example 9 Measurement of Natural Killer Cell Cytotoxic Activity The following procedure can be employed to assay NK cell activity in a subject. The procedure is adapted from Kantakamalakul W, Jaroenpool J, Pattanapanyasat K. A novel enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-K562 flow cytometric method for measuring natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxic activity. J Immunol Methods, 2003 Jan. 15; 272:189-197, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. Materials and methods: Human erythroleukaemic cell line, K562, is obtained from American Type Culture Collection (CCL-243, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va.), and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Cat #11875-093 Gibco Invitrogen Corp, Carlsbad, Calif.) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 100 IU/ml penicillin at 37° C. with 5% CO2. K562 cells are transduced with retroviral vector which encode green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Stable cell line is selected with antibiotic, G418. About 99.6% G418 resistant cells are eGFP positive after section. The subject's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are prepared by clinical study sites and received in BD Vacutainer Cell Preparation Tube with sodium heparin (Product Number: 362753, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, N.J.). Two-fold serial dilution of 800 μl effector cells (patient's PBMC) starting at concentration of 1×106 cells/mL are put into four individual polystyrene 12×75-mm tubes. Log phase growing target cells (K562/eGFP) are adjusted with growth medium (RPMI-1640) to a concentration of 1×105 cells/mL and 100 μl targets then added into the tubes to provide effector/target (E/T) ratios of 80:1, 40:1, 20:1, 10:1. Effector cells alone and target cells alone are used as controls. All tubes are incubated at 37° C. with 5% CO2 for about 3.5 hr. Ten microliters of propidium iodide (PI) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL is added to each tube including effector and target control tubes and then incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cytotoxic activity is analyzed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Linear amplification of the forward and side scatter (FSC/SSC) signals, as well as logarithmic amplification of eGFP and PI emission in green and red fluorescence is obtained. Ten thousand events per sample tube with no gating for acquisition are collected for analysis. Data analysis for two-parameter dot plots for eGFP versus PI is performed using CELLQuest (Becton Dickinson Biosciences) software to enumerate live and dead target cells. Debris and dead cells are excluded by setting a threshold of forward light scatter. Example 10 Inhibition of HUVEC cell migration To examine if the compounds of the invention affect endothelial cell function, an in vitro human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration assay is performed in the presence of a compound of the invention. HUVEC cells (passage number 4) are cultured on 12-well plates and time-lapse imaging is performed with the live cell imaging system on an inverted microscope supplied with 6-7% CO2. The temperature is kept at 37° C. Images are taken every 30 minutes using the 2× objective for up to 106 hr or every 60 seconds using the 20× objective for 30 min. Confluent HUVEC cultures are scraped similarly to make a blank area, followed by culturing in HUVEC medium for 15 hr without treatment. The migration areas, which are imaged as time-lapse sequences for each well, are used as a basis to standardize/correct migration rates. Then, migration of cells under different treatments is imaged at the same time to generate time-lapse image sequences for each well. Time-lapse movies are further analyzed by measuring areas that are covered by migrating cells. During experiments, HUVEC cells are activated by the presence of VEGF and basic FGF. Compounds of the invention (e.g. 100 nM and 1 μM) are expected to completely block migration of HUVEC cells to the blank area, indicating that compounds of the invention possesses potent inhibitory effect on the migration of activated HUVEC cell in vitro induced by VEGF and basic FGF. It is also possible to track HUVEC behavior during above treatments. It is expected that HUVEC cells will begin to shrink after 24 hr treatment with compounds of the invention. Example 11 Enhanced VE-cadherin junctions of HUVEC cells An immunofluorescence study is performed by using anti-VE-cadherin antibodies to examine VE-cadherin junctions between HUVEC cells. HUVEC cells are treated with DMSO or a compound of the invention (e.g. 10, 100 and 1000 nM) for 24 hrs and fixed for immunostaining, DMSO concentration is 1:100 for all treatments. To boost the immunofluorescence signal, cells are stained with a mixture of 2 polyclonal anti-human VE-cadherin Abs followed by staining with a mixture of fluorescent secondary antibodies. It is expected that with compounds of the invention, VE-cadherin staining will be extremely strong in cell-cell junction regions, but not the non-contacted regions compared to that in DMSO treated cultures. Compounds of the invention are expected to enhance the assembly of cell-cell junctions of activated human endothelial cells, likely through induction of the accumulation of VE-cadherin molecules at the junctions.
