DIBAL-H (1.2 ml, 1.17 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of compound 2-6 (310 mg, 0.529 mmol) in THF in a dry ice/acetone bath. After completion of addition, the mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 2 h. When the raw material was exhausted, which was monitored by TLC, the reaction was quenched with saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution, and the mixture was warmed to room temperature, filtered by suction, washed with ether, and the filtrate was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated, and directly used to the next step. The crude product was dissolved in dichloromethane and DMP (270 mg, 0.635 mmol) at 0 °C, the mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with saturated sodium thiosulfate solution/saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (v/v) = 1/1, and the resultant was extracted with dichloromethane, washed with brine, concentrated, and purified by column chromatography (n-hexane/ethyl acetate (v/v) = 50/1) to give product 2-7 (185 mg, yield 63%).1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz) δ10.14 (s, 1H), 4.27 (s, 1H), 3.76-3.58 (m, 4H), 2.45 (d, J = 13.2 Hz, 1H), 2.15 (s, 3H), 1.89-1.08 (m, 5H), 0.92 (s, 27H), 0.03 (s, 18H).
