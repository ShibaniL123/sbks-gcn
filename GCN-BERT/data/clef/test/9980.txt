4-{[(6-Bromo-3-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylic acid L-lysine salt
100 ml of ethanol were added to 2.0 g (4.05 mmol) of the compound from Example 1, and the mixture was heated to the boil. A solution of 593 mg (4.06 mmol) of L-lysine in 10 ml of water was added to the hot solution. After cooling to RT, the mixture was left to stand at RT under air until the solvent had evaporated. Decanting gave 2.58 g (quant., purity 100%, contains ethanol) of the title compound
