Synthesis of ethyl 3-(1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecan-1-yl)propanoate
K2CO3 (300 mg, 2.2 mmol) and ethyl 3-bromopropanoate (100 mg, 0.61 mmol) were added to a stirred solution of cyclen (380 mg, 2.2 mmol) in anhydrous CH3CN (10 mL), and the resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours under N2 atmosphere. Complete consumption of the starting materials was confirmed by TLC [stationary phase = Basic alumina TLC, mobile phase = CH2Cl2 : MeOH (10:1)]. The resulting product was separated from K2CO3 by filtration, and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. Column chromatography was used to obtain a pure compound (100 mg, 64%).
