CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/706,681, filed Sep. 27, 2012; the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are responsible for the control of a variety of signal transduction processes within cells (see, e.g., Hardie and Hanks, The Protein Kinase Facts Book, I and II, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 1995). Protein kinases are thought to have evolved from a common ancestral gene due to the conservation of their structure and catalytic function. Almost all kinases contain a similar 250-300 amino acid catalytic domain. The kinases can be categorized into families by the substrates they phosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine, lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these families (see, e.g., Hanks & Hunter, (1995), FASEB J. 9:576-596; Knighton et al., (1991), Science 253:407-414; Hiles et al., (1992), Cell 70:419-429; Kunz et al., (1993), Cell 73:585-596; Garcia-Bustos et al., (1994), EMBO J. 13:2352-2361). Many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated events. These diseases include autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies, asthma, alzheimer's disease and hormone-related diseases. As a consequence, there has been substantial efforts in medicinal chemistry to find inhibitors of protein kinases for use as therapeutic agents. Immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM)-mediated signaling has emerged as a primary event in signaling pathways responsible for human pathologies. ITAM-mediated signaling is responsible for relaying activation signals initiated at classical immune receptors such as T-cell receptors, B-cell receptors, Fc receptors in immune cells and at GPVI and FcγRIIa in platelets to downstream intracellular molecules such as Syk and ZAP-70 (Underhill, D. M and Goodridge, H. S., Trends Immunol., 28:66-73, 2007). The binding of a ligand to an ITAM-containing receptor triggers signaling events which allows for the recruitment of proteins from a family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases called the Src family. These kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues within the ITAM sequence, a region with which the tandem SH2 domains on either Syk or ZAP-70 interact. Syk, along with Zap-70, is a member of the Syk family of protein tyrosine kinases. The interaction of Syk or ZAP-70 with diphosphorylated ITAM sequences induces a conformation change in the kinases that allows for tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase itself. Phosphorylated Syk family members activate a multitude of downstream signaling pathway proteins which include Src homology 2 (SH2) domain containing leukocyte-specific phosphoprotein of 76 kDa (SLP-76), Linker of Activation of T-cells (LAT) and PLC (phospholipase C)γ2. Human pathologies attributed to dysfunctional ITAM-mediated signaling include autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, multiple sclerosis, hemolytic anemia, immune-thrombocytopenia purpura, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and arteriosclerosis. Interestingly, many of the above mentioned diseases are thought to occur through crosslinking of Fc receptors by antibodies which, via Syk, activate a signaling cascade in mast, basophil and other immune cells that result in the release of cell mediators responsible for inflammatory reactions. The release of mediators and the production of cytokines in IgE stimulation-dependent allergic and inflammatory reactions from mast cells and basophiles can be controlled by inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of Syk (Rossi, A. B. et al., J Allergy Clin Immunol., 118:749-755, 2006). In immune-thrombocytopenia, antibody bound platelets are cleared by the spleen by an Fc receptor/ITAM/Syk-mediated process (Crow, A. R. et al., Blood, 106:abstract 2165, 2005). Drug-induced thrombocytopenia, caused by heparin-platelet factor 4 immune complexes that activate platelet FcγRIIa, also involve Syk signaling downstream of receptor engagement (Reilly, M. P., Blood, 98:2442-2447, 2001). Platelet agonists induce inside-out integrin signaling resulting in fibrinogen binding and platelet aggregation. This initiates outside-in signaling which produces further stimulation of platelets. Syk is activated during both phases of integrin signaling, and inhibition of Syk is shown to inhibit platelet adhesion to immobilized proteins (Law, D. A. et al., Blood, 93:2645-2652, 1999). Release of arachidonic acid and serotonin and platelet aggregation induced by collagen are markedly inhibited in platelets derived from Syk deficient mouse (Poole, A. et al., EMBO J., 16:2333-2341, 1997). Thus Syk inhibitors may also possess anticoagulation action. Because of the role Syk plays in Ig-induced platelet activation, it is likely to be important in arteriosclerosis and restenosis. Arteriosclerosis is a class of diseases characterized by the thickening and hardening of the arterial walls of blood vessels. Although all blood vessels are susceptible to this serious degenerative condition, the aorta and the coronary arteries serving the heart are most often affected. Arteriosclerosis is of profound clinical importance since it can increase the risk of heart attacks, myocardial infarctions, strokes, and aneurysms. The traditional treatment for arteriosclerosis includes vascular recanalization procedures for less-serious blockages and coronary bypass surgery for major blockages. A serious shortcoming of intravascular procedures is that, in a significant number of treated individuals, some or all of the treated vessels restenose (i.e., re-narrow). For example, restenosis of an atherosclerotic coronary artery after PTCA (Percutaeous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty) occurs in 10-50% of patients undergoing this procedure and subsequently requires either further angioplasty or a coronary artery bypass graft. Furthermore, restenosis of an atherosclerotic coronary artery after stenting occurs in 10-20% of patients undergoing this procedure and subsequently requires repeat treatments to maintain adequate blood flow through the affected artery. Restenosis generally occurs in a relatively brief time period, e.g., roughly less than six months, after treatment. While the exact hormonal and cellular processes promoting restenosis have not been determined, restenosis is thought to be due in part to mechanical injury to the walls of the blood vessels caused by the balloon catheter or other intravascular device. For example, the process of PTCA, in addition to opening the obstructed artery, also injures resident coronary arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In response to this injury, adhering platelets, infiltrating macrophages, leukocytes, or the smooth muscle cells themselves release cell-derived growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), with subsequent proliferation and migration of medial SMCs through the internal elastic lamina to the area of the vessel intima. Further proliferation and hyperplasia of intimal SMCs and, most significantly, production of large amounts of extracellular matrix over a period of three to six months results in the filling in and narrowing of the vascular space sufficient to significantly obstruct blood flow. In addition to the role Syk plays in Ig-induced platelet activations, Syk plays a very important role in collagen-mediated signaling. The primary adhesive protein responsible for platelet adhesion and activation is collagen. Collagen is a filamentous protein contained within the fibrotic caps of atheromas which becomes exposed to blood during plaque rupture. Collagen functions initially by binding von Willebrand factor which tethers platelets through binding platelet membrane GPIb. Collagen functions secondarily by engaging the two collagen receptors on platelets, GPVI and integrin α2β1. GPVI exists in platelet membranes as a complex with FcRγ, an interaction required for the expression of GPVI. Activation of FcγRIIa on platelets results in platelet shape change, secretion and thrombosis. Signaling by the GPVI/FcRγ complex is initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the ITAM domain of FCRγ followed by the recruitment of Syk. Activation of GPVI leads to induction of multiple platelet functions including: activation of integrins α2β1 to achieve firm platelet adhesion, and GP IIb-IIIa which mediates platelet aggregation and thrombosis growth; platelet secretion, allowing for the delivery of inflammatory proteins such as CD40L, RANTES and TGFβ to the vessel wall; and the expression of P-selectin which allows for the recruitment of leukocytes. Therefore, it is believed that Syk inhibitors can inhibit thrombotic events mediated by platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation. It has been reported that the tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular protein (activation) induced by stimulation of a receptor for IgG antibody, FcγR, and the phagocytosis mediated by FcγR are considerably inhibited in macrophages derived from Syk deficient mouse (Crowley, M. T. et al., J. Exp. Med., 186:1027-1039, 1997). This suggests that Syk has a markedly important role in the FcγR-mediated phagocytosis of macrophages. It has also been reported that an antisense oligonucleotide of Syk suppresses the apoptosis inhibition of eosinophils induced by GM-CSF (Yousefi, S. et al., J. E. Med., 183:1407-1414, 1996), showing that Syk is essential for the life extending signal of eosinophils caused by GM-CSF and the like. Since life extension of eosinophils is closely related to the transition of diseases into a chronic state in allergic disorders, such as asthma, Syk inhibitors can also serve as therapeutic agents for chronic eosinophilic inflammation. Syk is important for the activation of B-cells via a B-cell antigen receptor and is involved in the phosphatidylinositol metabolism and increase in the intracellular calcium concentration caused by the antigen receptor stimulation (Hutchcroft, J E. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 267:8613-8619, 1992; and Takata, M. et al., EMBO J., 13:1341-1349, 1994). Thus, Syk inhibitors may be used to control the function of B-cells and are, therefore, expected to serve as therapeutic agents for antibody-related diseases. Syk binds to a T-cell antigen receptor, quickly undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation through crosslinking of the receptor and synergistically acts upon intracellular signals mediated by Src tyrosine kinases such as Lck (Couture, C. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91:5301-5305, 1994; and Couture, C. et al., Mol. Cell. Biol., 14:5249-5258, 1994). Syk is present in mature T-cell populations, such as intraepithelial γδ T-cells and naïve αβ T-cells, and has been reported to be capable of phosphorylation of multiple components of the TCR signaling cascade (Latour, S. et. al., Mol Cell Biol., 17:4434-4441, 1997). As a consequence, Syk inhibitors may serve as agents for inhibiting cellular immunity mediated by T-cell antigen receptor. Recent comparative genomic hybridization studies have identified Syk as another gene important in the pathogenesis of Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) (Chen, R. et al. Journal of Clinical Oncology, 2007 ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings (Post-Meeting Edition). Vol 25, No 18S (June 20 Supplement), 2007: 8056). MCL represents 5-10% of all non-Hodgkins lymphomas and it is a difficult form of lymphoma to treat. It has the worst prognosis among the B cell lymphomas with median survival of three years. It has been reported that Syk is overexpressed in MCL (Rinaldi, A, et. al, Br. J. Haematol., 2006; 132:303-316) and that Syk mediates mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin) survival signals in follicular, mantel cell, Burkitt's, and diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (Leseux, L., et. al, Blood, 2006; 108:4156-4162). Several lines of evidence suggest that many B-cell lymphomas depend upon B-cell receptor (BCR)-mediated survival signals. BCR signaling induces receptor oligomerization and phosphorylation of Igα and β immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activated motifs by SRC family kinases. ITAM phosphorylation results in the recruitment and activation of Syk that initiates downstream events and amplifies the original BCR signal. Given the role of tonic BCR signaling in normal B cell and Syk-dependent survival of non-Hodgkins lymphoma cell lines in vitro (Chen, L., et. al, Blood, 2006; 108:3428-3433), Syk inhibition is a promising rational treatment target for certain B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (Stefania Gobessi, Luca Laurenti, Pablo Longo, Laura Carsetti, Giuseppe Leone, Dimitar G. Efremov, Constitutive activation of the protein tyrosine kinase Syk in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia B-cells, Blood, 2007, 110, Abstract 1123). Recent data shows that administration of a multikinase inhibitor which inhibits Syk, may have significant clinical activity in CLL patients (Friedberg J W et al, Blood 2010; 115(13),). The oncogenic potential of the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) has been described in a number of different settings. Clinically, Syk over-expression is reported in Mantle Cell Lymphoma (Rinaldi, A, et al, Br. J. Haematol., 2006; 132:303-316) and the TEL-Syk fusion protein (Translocated ETS Leukemia) generated by a chromosomal translocation (t(9;12)(q22;p12)) leads to increased Syk activity and is associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (Kuno, Y., et. al, Blood, 2001; 97:1050-1055). Leukemia is induced in mice by adoptively transferring bone marrow cells that express human TEL-Syk (Wossning, T., JEM, 2006; 203:2829-2840). Further, in mouse primary bone marrow cells, over-expression of Syk results in IL-7 independent growth in culture (Wossning, T., et. al, JEM, 2006; 203:2829-2840). Additional recent studies also suggest that Syk-dependant survival signals may play a role in B-cell malignancies, including DLBCL (Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma), mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma (Gururajan, Jennings et al. 2006; Irish, Czerwinski et al. J Immunol 176(10): 5715-9 (2006). Given the role of tonic BCR signaling in normal B cells and Syk-dependent survival of NHL cell lines in vitro, the specific inhibition of Syk may prove promising for the treatment of certain B-cell lymphomas. Interestingly, Syk signaling appears to be required for B-cell development and survival in humans and mouse. Inducible loss of the B-cell receptor (Lam, K., et. al, Cell, 1997; 90:1073-1083) or Iga (Kraus, M., et. al, Cell, 2004; 117:787-800) results in loss of peripheral B-cells in mice. Over-expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-RO, which is known to negatively regulate Syk activity, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in cell lines derived from non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (Chen, L., et. al, Blood, 2006; 108:3428-3433). Finally, B-cell lymphomas rarely exhibit loss of BCR expression, and anti-idiotype therapy rarely leads to resistance (Kuppers, R. Nat Rev Cancer, 2005; 5:251-262). Engagement of the antigen-specific B cell receptor (BCR) activates multiple signaling pathways that ultimately regulate the cells activation status, promoting survival and clonal expansion. Signaling through the BCR is made possible by its association with two other members of the immunoglobulin super-family; Igα and Igβ, each bearing an immuno-tyrosine based activation motif (ITAM) (Jumaa, Hendriks et al. Annu Rev Immunol 23: 415-45 (2005). The ITAM domain is directly phosphorylated by Src family kinases in response to BCR engagement. The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) docks with and phosphorylates the ITAM, a process that enhances its kinase activity, resulting in Syk autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple downstream substrates (Rolli, Gallwitz et al. Mol Cell 10(5): 1057-69 (2002). This signaling pathway is active in B cells beginning at the transition from pro- to pre-B cell stage of development, when the newly formed pre-BCR is expressed. In fact, B cell development arrests at the pro-B cell stage in Syk knockout mice (Cheng, Rowley et al. 1995; Turner, Mee et al. Nature 378(6554): 303-6 (1995). Inducible loss of the B cell receptor (Lam, Kuhn et al. Cell 90(6): 1073-83 (1997) or Igα (Kraus, Alimzhanov et al. Cell 117(6): 787-800 (2004) results in loss of peripheral B cells in mice. Human B cells also appear to require Syk for proliferation and survival. Over-expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP-RO, a negative regulator of Syk activity, inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in cell lines derived from non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) (Chen, Juszczynski et al. Blood 108(10): 3428-33 (2006). Knock down of Syk by siRNA in the NHL line SUDHL-4 led to a block in the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (Gururajan, Dasu et al. J Immunol 178(1): 111-21 (2007). Together, these data suggest that Syk signaling is required for the development, proliferation, and even survival of human and mouse B cells. Recently, R406 (Rigel Pharmaceuticals) was reported to inhibit ITAM signaling in response to various stimuli, including FccRl and BCR induced Syk activation (Braselmann, Taylor et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 319(3): 998-1008(2006). Interestingly, this ATP-competitive inhibitor of Syk was also active against Flt3, cKit, and JAK kinases, but not against Src kinsase (Braselmann, Taylor et al. 2006). Activating mutations to Flt3 are associated with AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) and inhibition of this kinase is currently under clinical development (Burnett and Knapper Hematology Am Soc Hematol Educ Program 2007: 429-34 (2007). Over-activation of the tyrosine kinase cKit is also associated with hematologic malignancies, and a target for cancer therapy (Heinrich, Griffith et al. Blood 96(3): 925-32 (2000). Similarly, JAK3 signaling is implicated in leukemias and lymphomas, and is currently exploited as a potential therapeutic target (Heinrich, Griffith et al. 2000). Importantly, the multi-kinase inhibitory activity of R406 attenuates BCR signaling in lymphoma cell lines and primary human lymphoma samples, resulting in apoptosis of the former (Chen, Monti et al. Blood 111(4): 2230-7 (2008). Further, a phase II clinical trial reported favorable results by this compound in refractory NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Friedberg J W et al, Blood 2010; 115(13)). Although the precise mechanism of action is unclear for R406, the data suggest that inhibition of kinases that mediate survival signaling in lymphocytes is clinically beneficial. Additional recent studies also suggest that Syk-dependant survival signals may play a role in B-cell malignancies, including DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma (see e.g., S. Linfengshen et al. Blood, February 2008; 111: 2230-2237; J. M. Irish et al. Blood, 2006; 108: 3135-3142; A. Renaldi et al. Brit J. Haematology, 2006; 132: 303-316; M. Guruoajan et al. J. Immunol, 2006; 176: 5715-5719; L. Laseux et al. Blood, 2006; 108: 4156-4162. While progress has been made in this field, there remains a need in the art for compounds that inhibit Syk kinase, as well as for methods for treating conditions in a patient, such as restenosis, and/or inflammation that can benefit from such inhibition. Moreover, the availability of compounds that selectively inhibit one of these kinases as compared to other kinases would also be desirable. The present invention satisfies this and other needs.

The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” is meant to include salts of the active compounds which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of salts derived from pharmaceutically-acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically-acceptable organic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including substituted amines, cyclic amines, naturally-occurring amines and the like, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from relatively nontoxic organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like. Also included are salts of amino acids such as arginate and the like, and salts of organic acids like glucuronic or galactunoric acids and the like (see, e.g., Berge, S. M. et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts,” Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66:1-19, 1977). Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts. The neutral forms of the compounds may be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present invention. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient” means a carrier or excipient that is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition that is generally safe, nontoxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes a carrier or excipient that is acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient” as used in the specification and claims includes both one and more than one such carrier or excipient. The terms “pharmaceutically effective amount”, “therapeutically effective amount” or “therapeutically effective dose” refer to the amount of the subject compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. The term “therapeutically effective amount” includes that amount of a compound that, when administered, is sufficient to prevent development of, or alleviate to some extent, one or more of the symptoms of the condition or disorder being treated. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending on the compound, the disorder or condition and its severity and the age, weight, etc., of the mammal to be treated. “Protecting group” refers to a group of atoms that, when attached to a reactive functional group in a molecule, mask, reduce or prevent the reactivity of the functional group. Typically, a protecting group may be selectively removed as desired during the course of a synthesis. Examples of protecting groups can be found in Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed., 1999, John Wiley & Sons, NY and Harrison et al., Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods, Vols. 1-8, 1971-1996, John Wiley & Sons, NY. Representative amino protecting groups include, but are not limited to, formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl (“CBZ”), tert-butoxycarbonyl (“Boc”), trimethylsilyl (“TMS”), 2-trimethylsilyl-ethanesulfonyl (“TES”), trityl and substituted trityl groups, allyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (“FMOC”), nitro-veratryloxycarbonyl (“NVOC”) and the like. Representative hydroxy protecting groups include, but are not limited to, those where the hydroxy group is either acylated or alkylated such as benzyl and trityl ethers, as well as alkyl ethers, tetrahydropyranyl ethers, trialkylsilyl ethers (e.g., TMS or TIPPS groups) and allyl ethers. “Tautomer” refers to alternate forms of a molecule that differ in the position of a proton, such as enol-keto and imine-enamine tautomers, or the tautomeric forms of heteroaryl groups containing a —N═C(H)—NH— ring atom arrangement, such as pyrazoles, imidazoles, benzimidazoles, triazoles, and tetrazoles. A person of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that other tautomeric ring atom arrangements are possible. The terms “treat”, “treating”, “treatment” and grammatical variations thereof as used herein, includes partially or completely delaying, alleviating, mitigating or reducing the intensity, progression, or worsening of one or more attendant symptoms of a disorder or condition and/or alleviating, mitigating or impeding one or more causes of a disorder or condition. Treatments according to the invention may be applied preventively, prophylactically, pallatively or remedially. The term “wavy line” signifies the point of attachment of the substituent to the remainder of the molecule. When the wavy line is not depicted as being specifically appended to a specific ring atom, the point of attachment can be to any suitable atom of the substituent. For example, the wavy line in the following structure: is intended to include, as the point of attachment, any of the six substitutable carbon atoms. Compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “isomers”. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “stereoisomers”. “Stereoisomer” and “stereoisomers” refer to compounds that exist in different stereoisomeric forms if they possess one or more asymmetric centers or a double bond with asymmetric substitution and, therefore, can be produced as individual stereoisomers or as mixtures. Stereoisomers include enantiomers and diastereomers. Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed “diastereomers” and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed “enantiomers”. When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (−)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a “racemic mixture”. Unless otherwise indicated, the description is intended to include individual stereoisomers as well as mixtures. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art (see discussion in Chapter 4 of ADVANCED ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 4th edition J. March, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1992) differ in the chirality of one or more stereocenters. The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with isotopes, such as for example deuterium (2H), tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Unless indicated otherwise, the nomenclature of substituents that are not explicitly defined herein are arrived at by naming the terminal portion of the functionality followed by the adjacent functionality toward the point of attachment. For example, the substituent “alkoxyalkyl” refers to an akyl group that is substituted with alkoxy, “hydoxyalkyl” refers to an akyl group that is substituted with hydroxyl, and (phenyl)C1-8alkyl refers to an akyl group that is substituted with phenyl. For these substituents, the point of attachment is at the alkyl group. It is understood that the definitions and formulas provided herein are not intended to include impermissible substitution patterns (e.g., methyl substituted with 5 fluoro groups). Such impermissible substitution patterns are well known to the skilled artisan. An “antagonist” or “inhibitor” refers to an agent or molecule that inhibits or binds to, partially or totally blocks stimulation or activity, decreases, closes, prevents, delays activation or enzymatic activity, inactivates, desensitizes, or down regulates the activity of a receptor of the invention. As used herein, “antagonist” also includes a reverse or inverse agonist. As used herein, the term “condition or disorder responsive to modulation of Syk” and related terms and phrases refer to a condition or disorder associated with inappropriate, e.g., less than or greater than normal, activity of Syk and at least partially responsive to or affected by modulation of Syk (e.g., Syk antagonist or agonist results in some improvement in patient well-being in at least some patients). Inappropriate functional activity of Syk might arise as the result of expression of Syk in cells which normally do not express the receptor, greater than normal production of Syk, or slower than normal metabolic inactivation or elimination of Syk or its active metabolites, increased expression of Syk or degree of intracellular activation (leading to, e.g., inflammatory and immune-related disorders and conditions) or decreased expression of Syk. A condition or disorder associated with Syk may include a “Syk-mediated condition or disorder”. As used herein, the phrases “a condition or disorder mediated at least in part by Syk kinase activity”, and related phrases and terms refer to a condition or disorder characterized by inappropriate, e.g., greater than normal, Syk activity. Inappropriate Syk functional activity might arise as the result of Syk expression in cells which normally do not express Syk or increased Syk expression or degree of intracellular activation (leading to, e.g., inflammatory and immune-related disorders and conditions). A condition or disorder mediated at least in part by Syk or JAK kinase activity may be completely or partially mediated by inappropriate Syk functional activity. However, a condition or disorder mediated at least in part by Syk kinase activity is one in which modulation of Syk results in some effect on the underlying condition or disorder (e.g., an Syk antagonist results in some improvement in patient well-being in at least some patients). The term “intervention” refers to an action that produces an effect or that is intended to alter the course of a disease process. For example, “vascular intervention” refers to the use of an intravascular procedure such as angioplasty or a stent to open an obstructed blood vessel. The term “intravascular device” refers to a device useful for a vascular recanalization procedure to restore blood flow through an obstructed blood vessel. Examples of intravascular devices include, without limitation, stents, balloon catheters, autologous venous/arterial grafts, prosthetic venous/arterial grafts, vascular catheters, and vascular shunts. The terms “modulate”, “modulation” and the like refer to the ability of a compound to increase or decrease the function and/or expression of Syk, where such function may include transcription regulatory activity and/or protein-binding. Modulation may occur in vitro or in vivo. Modulation, as described herein, includes the inhibition, antagonism, partial antagonism, activation, agonism or partial agonism of a function or characteristic associated with Syk, either directly or indirectly, and/or the upregulation or downregulation of the expression of Syk, either directly or indirectly. In a preferred embodiment, the modulation is direct. Inhibitors or antagonists are compounds that, e.g., bind to, partially or totally block stimulation, decrease, prevent, inhibit, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or downregulate signal transduction. Activators or agonists are compounds that, e.g., bind to, stimulate, increase, open, activate, facilitate, enhance activation, activate, sensitize or upregulate signal transduction. The ability of a compound to inhibit the function of Syk can be demonstrated in a biochemical assay, e.g., binding assay, or a cell-based assay, e.g., a transient transfection assay. “Modulators” of activity are used to refer to “ligands”, “antagonists” and “agonists” identified using in vitro and in vivo assays for activity and their homologs and mimetics. Modulators include naturally occurring and synthetic ligands, antagonists, agonists, molecules and the like. Assays to identify antagonists and agonists include, e.g., applying putative modulator compounds to cells, in the presence or absence of a receptor of the invention and then determining the functional effects on a receptor of the invention activity. Samples or assays comprising a receptor of the invention that are treated with a potential activator, inhibitor, or modulator are compared to control samples without the inhibitor, activator, or modulator to examine the extent of effect. Control samples (untreated with modulators) are assigned a relative activity value of 100%. Inhibition is achieved when the activity value of a receptor of the invention relative to the control is about 80%, optionally 50% or 25-1%. Activation is achieved when the activity value of a receptor of the invention relative to the control is 110%, optionally 150%, optionally 200-500%, or 1000-3000% higher. “Subject” refers to human and non-human animals, especially mammals. Examples of subjects include, but are not limited to, humans, cows, dogs, cats, goats, sheep, pigs and rabbits.

EXAMPLES The following examples are offered to illustrate, but not to limit, the claimed invention. Preparative Examples The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds generally are either available from commercial suppliers, such as Aldrich Chemical Co., or are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references such as Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis; Wiley & Sons: New York, 1967-2004, Volumes 1-22; Rodd's Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989, Volumes 1-5 and Supplementals; and Organic Reactions, Wiley & Sons: New York, 2005, Volumes 1-65. The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes can be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to, filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. Such materials can be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data. Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature range of from about −78° C. to about 150° C., more preferably from about 0° C. to about 125° C., and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20° C. to about 75° C. Compounds of Formula I can be synthesized by a variety of methods, including the route outlined in FIG. 1. In general, the methods include formation of the fused bicyclic 10-membered core and attachment of substituents to the core. As shown in FIG. 1, for example, enamine 1a can be derived from a suitable starting material (such as an o-toluate derivative) and converted to aldehyde 1b. Reductive amination of aldehyde 1b with a protected amine, followed by amide bond formation, provides the bicycle 1c for further elaboration. Nucleophilic addition of a functionalized amine NH2—Y1 and cross-coupling of an aromatic species Z1-L-A can be conducted in any order to form the protected product 1e. Global deprotection affords the desired product. FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 show the synthesis of heterocycles 2 and 3 from common precursors. In particular, methyl (2-bromo-3-fluoro-5-methyl)benzoate is converted to aldehyde 2b via enamine 2a. The reductive amination/condensation sequence is conducted with p-methoxybenzylamine to provide bicycle 2c, which is subsequently converted to Boc-protected diaminocylcohexane derivative 2d. This common intermediate can be further elaborated via Buchwald-Hartwig coupling, as shown in FIG. 2, or via Suzuki coupling, as shown in FIG. 3, to provide compounds 2 and 3, respectively.

The potent affinities for human JAK/Syk inhibition exhibited by the inventive compounds can be measured by an IC50 value (in nM). The IC50 value is the concentration of the compound required to provide 50% inhibition of human JAK/Syk proteolytic activity. The smaller the IC50 value, the more active (potent) is a compound for inhibiting Syk activity. An in vitro assay for detecting and measuring inhibition activity against Syk is as follows. SYK tyrosine phosphorylation activity is measured using the LANCE™ Technology developed by Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences (Boston, Mass.). LANCE™ refers to homogeneous time resolved fluorometry applications using techniques such as time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay (TR-FRET) (see generally for procedures in Perkin Elmer Application Note—How to Optimize a Tyrosine Kinase Assay Using Time Resolved Fluorescence-Based LANCE Detection, wwww.perkinelmer.com/lifesciences). The assay principle involves detection of a phosphorylated substrate using energy transfer from a phosphospecific europium-labeled antibody to streptavidin-allophycocyanin as an acceptor. Molecules are reconstituted in 30% DMSO and serially diluted 1:3 with the final dilution containing DMSO in the absence of the candidate molecule. The final DMSO concentration in the assay is 3%. Kinase assays are performed as a two part reaction. The first reaction is a kinase reaction which comprises a candidate molecule, full length active recombinant SYK enzyme (Millipore, Calif.), and biotin-DEEDYESP-OH, a biotin-labeled SYK-specific substrate. The second reaction involves termination of the kinase reaction and the simultaneous addition of the detection reagents—europium-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine reagent (Eu-W1024-PY100, Perkin Elmer, Boston, Mass.) and Streptavidin-Allophycocyanin detection reagent (SA-APC, Prozyme, CA). The kinase reaction is performed in a black U-bottom 96-well microtitre plate. The final reaction volume is 50 μL and contains a final concentration of 1 nM active SYK enzyme, 550 nM SYK-substrate, and 100 μM ATP diluted in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 1 hour at room temperature. The quench buffer contains 100 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl2, 20 mM EDTA, 0.02% Brij35, and 0.5% BSA. The detection reagents are added to the reaction mixture at the following dilutions—1:500 for Eu-W1024-PY100 and 1:250 for SA-APC. The kinase reaction is terminated by the addition of 50 μL quench buffer containing the detection reagents. The detection is allowed to proceed for 1 hr at room temperature. Detection of the phosphorylated substrate in the absence and presence of inhibitors is measured in the TR-FRET instrument, Analyst HT (Molecular Probes, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the condition for measurements are set using CriterionHost Release 2.0 (Molecular Probes, Sunnyvale, Calif.). The settings used are as follows: excitation 360 nm, emission 665—7.5 nm, beam splitter 350 nm 50/50, flash 100 pulses, delay 60 us, integration 400 us, z-height 2 mm. Inhibition of SYK-tyrosine kinase activity is calculated as the maximum response observed in the presence of inhibitor, compared to that in the absence of inhibitor. IC50 values are derived by non-linear regression analysis. IC50 data for compounds of the present invention was obtained using the assay described above, as outlined in Table 2. TABLE 2 Kinase Inhibitor IC50 Data EXAMPLE NO. IC50 (nM)a 1 +++ 4 ++ 6 +++ 7 + aMeasured IC50 values: +++ ≦100 nM; ++ ≦250 nM; + >250 nM. Intracellular phospho-flow cytometry can be used to test compound inhibition of Syk activity in the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line Ramos. 1×106 cells in log phase growth were aliqoted; Syk kinase is activated by incubating cells for 10 minutes with 3 μg/ml antibody specific to the B cell receptor. Directly following, cells are fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 5 minutes at room temperature, washed in phosphate buffered saline, and then permeablized by incubation for 2 hours in ice cold methanol. Cells are again washed in phosphate buffered saline, then incubated for 30 minutes with antibody specific for phosphorylated Erk (Y204), which are indicators of Syk kinase activity. All antibodies used are purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, Calif.). After incubation with antibodies, cells are again washed and subjected to flow cytometry. Syk has been implicated experimentally in B cell development, proliferation, and survival. Moreover, Syk is implicated as an oncogene. Expression of constitutively active Syk in adoptively transferred bone marrow cells induces leukemia in mice, and over-activity of Syk is associated with a variety of lymphomas in humans Given the role of Syk in B cell biology, its selective inhibition may be sufficient to provide clinical benefit in B cell proliferative disorders, while reducing toxicities that may arise due to suppression of other off-target kinases. The anti-proliferative effects of compounds on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B cell lines SUDHL-4, SUDHL-6, and Toledo can also assessed. SUDHL-4 and SUDHL-6 require B cell receptor signaling for growth and survival, while the Toledo cell line (serving here as a negative control) does not. Cells are aliquoted into each well of a 96-well plate and incubated with increasing concentrations of compound for 72 hours, after which cell survival and proliferation is determined using the MTT assay (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, Calif.) following protocols supplied by the manufacturer. Induction of apoptosis in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma B cell lines SUDHL-4, SUDHL-6, and Toledo is assessed by measuring the apoptotis marker Caspase 3. Cells were incubated with 1, 3, or 10 μM compound for 24, 48, and 72 hours. At the conclusion of each time point, cells are processed for flow cytometry analysis using the Monoclonal Rabbit Anti-Active Caspase-3 Antibody Kit and related protocols (BD Pharmingen). Syk activity is not only required for B cell signaling, proliferation, and survival, as shown, but is also critical for cellular activation upon cross-linking of the B cell receptor. B cell activation leads to increased cell surface expression of several proteins involved in cell signaling, antigen presentation, and adhesion. Among these, CD80, CD86, and CD69 are commonly measured to determine B cell activation status. Primary mouse B cells isolated from spleen can be aliquoted and incubated with increasing concentrations of compound (0.05 to 20M) in the presence of goat anti-mouse IgD (eBiosciences, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) for 20 hours to cross-link the B cell receptor. Cells are washed and incubated for 30 minutes on ice with antibodies specific for the CD80, CD86, and CD69 B cell activation markers. B cells are identified from the pooled population by staining with the B cell marker CD45RO. All antibodies are purchased from BD Pharmingen.
