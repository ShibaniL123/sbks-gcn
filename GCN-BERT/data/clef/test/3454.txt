CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/566,879, filed Dec. 5, 2011. The foregoing application is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This present disclosure relates to methods and formulations for delivery of sildenafil, and derivatives thereof, to the circulatory system by administration via an oral spray formulation to treat disease, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) induced sexual dysfunction. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved sildenafil citrate tablets for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I) under the brand name REVATIO®. The recommended dose of REVATIO® is 20 mg three times a day. Sildenafil citrate was first approved by the FDA for the treatment of male erectile dysfunction under the brand name VIAGRA®. Sildenafil is reported to be a selective inhibitor of cyclic-GMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Its effects in treating pulmonary arterial hypertension (and erectile dysfunction) occur by enhancing the downstream effects of nitric oxide (NO) mediated vasorelaxation. PDE5 is found in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle and the corpus cavernosum, as well as in tissues such as vascular and visceral smooth muscle and in platelets. Sildenafil increases cyclic-GMP (cGMP) by inhibiting PDE5. PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP. As a result, sildenafil increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells. In patients with pulmonary hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilation in the systemic circulation (see, e.g., REVATIO® product literature). In addition to its therapeutic benefits in diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and erectile dysfunction, sildenafil is reported to be efficacious in the treatment of sexual dysfunctions associated with SSRI administration. See, e.g., Stimmel, G L, “Sexual dysfunction and psychotropic medications” CNS Spectr. (2006) 11:8(Suppl 9):24-30 and Wang, W-F et al. “Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of premature ejaculation” Chin Med J (2007) 120(11):1000-1006. Sexual dysfunctions are a main side effect of SSRIs, and include difficulties with libido, arousal, delayed or absent orgasm (e.g., anorgasmia in women), and delayed ejaculation, anejaculation, or erectile dysfunction in men. Ibid. In patients suffering from sexual dysfunction as a result of SSRI treatment, administration of sildenafil as adjunct therapy may improve and sustain arousal, for example, in the patient by increasing blood flow, and sildenafil is thought to exert an indirect beneficial effect on other aspects of sexual response via the same mechanism. See, e.g., Stimmel, G L. CNS Spectr. (2006) 11:8(Suppl 9):24-30. Sildenafil has been proposed as a possible therapeutic in the treatment of a number of other conditions as well. These include female sexual dysfunction, including sexual dysfunction associated with menopause, such as difficulties with sexual arousal. See, e.g., Mattar, C N et al. “Care of women in menopause: sexual function, dysfunction and therapeutic modalities” Ann Acad Med Singapore (2008) 37:215-223. Other conditions for which sildenafil may provide a therapeutic benefit include high-altitude illness (see, e.g., Luks, A M et al CHEST (2008) 133:744-755), pain, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and irritable bowl syndrome (see, e.g., Sharma, R Indian J Med Sci (2007) 61:667-679 and Uthayathas, S et al. Pharmacological Reports (2007) 59:150-163). Despite its effectiveness in treating diseases such as PAH and erectile dysfunction, the administration of solid oral sildenafil dosage forms may also cause undesirable side effects. At high dosages, the incidence of such side effects increase, for example, abnormal vision problems (ranging from blue or green halo effects to blurring), dyspepsia, nasal congestion, blinding headaches, flushing, redness, diarrhea, dizziness, rash, and urinary tract infection. Other more serious side effects may occur in some cases resulting from a physiological predisposition, adverse drug interaction or potentiation, or by drug abuse. Such side effects include syncope (loss of consciousness), priapism (erection lasting 4 hours or more), and increased cardiac risk (coital coronaries). In particular, hypotension crisis may result from the combination of sildenafil citrate and organic nitrates, causing death in some cases. Hence, its administration to patients who are concurrently using organic nitrates (such as nitroglycerin) in any form is contraindicated. Moreover, the long-term effects of large doses of sildenafil-containing drugs are unknown (Handy B., “The Viagra® Craze,” Time, pp. 50-57 (May 4, 1998)). Many drugs exhibit low bioavailabilities owing to extensive first pass metabolism. Differences in bioavailability may have profound clinical significance. Sildenafil citrate, for example, exhibits only a 40% bioavailability after oral administration via tablet form, of which the active metabolite accounts for about one-half. Compared to the administration of solid oral dosage forms absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity presents the possibility for more rapid and efficient drug delivery because of its rich vascular supply. The oral cavity exhibits a minimal barrier to drug transport and may result in a rapid rise in serum concentration of drug. However, the formulation of dosage forms for administration to the oral mucosa often poses non-trivial problems. For significant drug absorption to occur across the oral mucosa, the drug must have a prolonged exposure to the mucosal surface and the formulation must be both chemically stable and pharmaceutically acceptable to patients. WO 01/35926 discloses sildenafil dosage forms for non-oral use, such as nasal delivery. However, there is currently no commercially available dosage form for oral spray delivery of sildenafil. Thus, there is an ongoing need and desire for discreet and convenient sildenafil dosage forms for the treatment of diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction, which are both chemically stable and pharmaceutically acceptable. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure is directed to methods and formulations for treating diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and/or S SRI-induced sexual dysfunction.

FIG. 5 (Figure 7.2.6.6-1) is a graph depicting mean plasma N-desmethylsildenafil/sildenafil ratio (0-4 hours) N=24. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Sildenafil is designated chemically as 1-[[3-(6,7-dihydro-1-methyl-7-oxo-3-propyl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)-4-ethoxyphenyl]sulfonyl]-4-methylpiperazine. The oral spray formulation disclosed herein comprises sildenafil or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids including organic and inorganic acids. Such acids include acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethane-sulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, and p-toluenesulfonic acids. N-desmethylsildenafil is one known active metabolite of sildenafil. Sildenafil, administered as the commercially available REVATIO® formulation for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I) to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening, is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, with absolute bioavailability of about 40%. Based on the REVATIO® manufacturer's product literature, maximum observed plasma concentrations are reached within 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes) of oral dosing in the fasted state. When the REVATIO® formulation is taken with a high-fat meal, the rate of absorption is reduced, with a mean delay in Tmax of 60 minutes and mean reduction in Cmax of 29%. The mean steady state volume of distribution (Vss) for sildenafil is reportedly 105 L, indicating distribution into the tissues. The oral spray formulation disclosed herein is formulated for delivery via the oral cavity. The sildenafil oral spray formulation may be delivered transmucosally, sublingually, via the buccal cavity, via mucosal membranes and/or through the gastrointestinal tract. The oral spray formulation of the instant application is suitable for use in the treatment of one or more diseases for which sildenafil administration is considered efficacious.

The formulation vehicle was stable when stored 25° C./60% RH and 40° C./75% RH for six months. Example 2 Subjects are provided sildenafil citrate in an oral spray dosage form as a part of a single-dose study. One subset of subjects is administered one spray of an oral spray sildenafil formulation comprising 14 mg sildenafil citrate per spray (providing a total administered amount equivalent to 10 mg sildenafil base). A second subset of subjects is administered two sprays of an oral spray sildenafil formulation comprising 14 mg sildenafil citrate per spray (providing a total administered amount equivalent to 20 mg sildenafil base). A third subset of subjects is administered three sprays of an oral spray sildenafil formulation comprising 14 mg sildenafil citrate per spray (providing a total administered amount equivalent to 30 mg sildenafil base). Example 3 A Relative Bioavailability Study of Sildenafil Oral Spray at 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg Doses Versus 25 mg VIAGRA® Tablets Under Fasting Conditions Objective This study assessed the relative bioavailability of sildenafil oral spray compared to that of VIAGRA® tablets by Pfizer Labs following a single oral dose [1×14 mg/0.12 mL sildenafil citrate oral spray (equivalent to 10 mg sildenafil base), 2×14 mg/0.12 mL sildenafil citrate oral sprays (equivalent to 20 mg sildenafil base), 3×14 mg/0.12 mL sildenafil citrate oral sprays (equivalent to 30 mg sildenafil base), or 1×25 mg tablet] in healthy adult subjects when administered under fasting conditions. Secondary objectives were to assess the relative safety of the sildenafil oral spray following single oral dose administration compared to that of VIAGRA® tablets. Assessments include evaluation of changes in orthostatic hypotension, oral irritation, vital sign assessments, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical assessments. Study Design This was an open-label, single-dose, randomized, four-period, four-treatment crossover study under fasting conditions. The total number of healthy adult male subjects enrolled in the study was twenty-four (24). The total duration of the study, screening through study exit, was approximately nine weeks with at least a three-day washout period between doses. At study check-in, the subjects reported to the clinical site at least 36 hours prior to Day 1 dosing for Period I and at least 12 hours prior to Day 1 dosing for Periods II, III, and IV. Subjects were required to stay for at least 24 hours after each treatment period. Following each washout period, subjects returned to the clinical facility to be dosed with the alternative treatments as per the randomization. Blood sample collection was obtained within 90 minutes, but no later than 30 minutes, prior to dosing (0 hour) and after dose administration at 0.083, 0.167, 0.25, 0.33, 0.50, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours. The actual time of sample collection was documented. During each study period, a total of 18 blood samples were collected for a total of 72 samples and 432 mL total volume. The actual time of sample collection was documented. Bioanalytical Sample Analyses The sildenafil and N-desmethylsildenafil plasma concentrations were measured using a validated bioanalytical method and according to the standard operating procedures and FDA Guidelines. The validated detection range for sildenafil is 1 to 300 ng/mL in human plasma. The validated detection range for N-desmethylsildenafil is 0.25 to 75 ng/mL in human plasma. Pharmacokinetic Data Analyses Pharmacokinetic parameters for plasma sildenafil and N-desmethylsildenafil concentration were calculated using standard noncompartmental approaches as indicated below: AUC0-t The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, from time 0 to the last measurable concentration, as calculated by the linear trapezoidal method.AUC0-inf The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity. AUC0-inf is calculated as the sum of the AUC0-t plus the ratio of the last measurable plasma concentration to the elimination rate constant.AUC0-t/AUC0-inf The ratio of AUC0-t to AUC0-inf.Cmax Maximum measured plasma concentration over the time span specified.Tmax Time of the maximum measured plasma concentration. If the maximum value occurs at more than one time point, Tmax is defined as the first time point with this value.Kel Apparent first-order terminal elimination rate constant calculated from a semi-log plot of the plasma concentration versus time curve. The parameter will be calculated by linear least-squares regression analysis in the terminal log-linear phase (three or more non-zero plasma concentrations).T1/2 The apparent first-order terminal elimination half-life will be calculated as 0.693/Kel.Ratio The ratio of metabolite/parent will be assessed at each concentration as well for Metabolite/Parent PK parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf. No value of Kel, AUC0-inf, or T1/2 will be reported for cases that do not exhibit a terminal log-linear phase in the concentration versus time profile. Other pharmacokinetic parameters may be calculated if deemed necessary. Statistical Analyses Arithmetic means, standard deviations and coefficients of variation were calculated for the parameters listed above. Additionally, geometric means were calculated for AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed on the ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax. The ANOVA model includes sequence, formulation and period as fixed effects and subject nested within sequence as a random effect. Sequence is tested using subject nested within sequence as the error term. A 10% level of significance is used to test the sequence effect. Each analysis of variance includes calculation of least-squares means, the difference between adjusted formulation means and the standard error associated with this difference. The above statistical analyses were performed using the appropriate SAS® procedure. In agreement with the two one-sided test for bioequivalence, 90% confidence intervals for the difference between drug formulation least-squares means (LSM) were calculated for the parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, and Cmax using ln-transformed data. The confidence intervals are expressed as a percentage relative to the LSM of the reference formulation. Ratios of means were calculated using the LSM for ln-transformed AUC0-t, ACU0-inf, and Cmax. The geometric mean values are reported. Ratios of means are expressed as a percentage of the LSM for the reference formulation. Bioequivalence is based on the 90% confidence intervals for sildenafil. Mouth Preparation Between 1.25 hours (study hour −1.25) and 1 hour (study hour −1) prior to dosing, including Period I Day −1 placebo dose, subjects brushed their teeth and tongue with toothpaste provided by the clinical site. After completing the brushing, subjects immediately rinsed their mouths three times with approximately 80 mL of room temperature water to total 240 mL (8 fluid ounces). Saliva pH Assessments Saliva pH was measured at 2300 hours (±30 minutes) on Day −1, and on Day 1 within 30 minutes prior to teeth and tongue brushing, within 30 minutes of completion of teeth and tongue brushing, and within 15 minutes prior to dosing. For the placebo dose (Day −1 of Period I), the saliva pH was measured at 2300 hours (+30 minutes) on Day −2, and on Day −1 within 30 minutes prior to teeth and tongue brushing, within 30 minutes of completion of teeth and tongue brushing, and within 15 minutes prior to placebo dosing. The pH was measured using pH test strips with a range of 5-9. Any subject that had a pH of 5 was additionally tested with pH test strips with a range of 0-6. Oral Spray Administration Within 30 minutes prior to administration, the spray product bottle was primed by actuating five sprays according to priming instructions provided by the sponsor prior to study start. A new spray bottle was used for each subject for each dose. At the time of dosing, subjects were instructed to open their mouths and place their relaxed tongues against their bottom rows of teeth. Study staff then administered the appropriate number of sprays according to the randomization schedule. After dosing, subjects were instructed to close their mouths and place their tongues against their bottom row of teeth for two minutes. Subjects were instructed not to swallow or swish around the product in their mouth during the two minutes. After two minutes, the subjects were instructed to swallow and any deviation from this time was recorded. After swallowing was complete, an objective oral irritation assessment (soft tissue irritation within the labial or buccal mucosa and tongue) was performed. Reference Product Administration A single 25 mg dose of Viagra® Tablets (1×25 mg) was administered on Day 1 dosing with approximately 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of room temperature water. Site personnel ensured the entire dose and fluid were swallowed. Post-Dose Questionnaire Immediately after dosing was completed and at one hour after dosing, subjects were queried on the following regarding the test product: Taste of the productWillingness to take the product againAny presence of excessive salivation If oral irritation persisted beyond one hour, subjects were queried at all irritation evaluations after one hour with the following: “How does your mouth feel?” Study Procedures Study Check-In (Day −2 of Period I) At study check-in, the subjects reported to the clinical site at least 36 hours prior to Day 1 dosing and were required to stay for 24 hours after Day 1 dosing.

Study Day Procedures (Day −1 of Period I) Prior to placebo dosing, the following activities were completed: Measured saliva pH before subject brushed their teeth and the tongueSubjects brushed their teeth and tongue prior to dose administrationMeasured saliva pH after subject brushed their teeth and tongueMeasured saliva pH within 15 minutes prior to dose administrationAssessed the oral cavity for baseline oral irritation prior to placebo administrationNo fluid was allowed from one hour prior to dose administration until one hour after dosing. At 24 hours prior to Day 1 dosing, each subject was dosed sequentially with one dose (three sprays) of placebo oral spray during Period I for a total of one dose per subject. After placebo dosing, the following activities were completed: Both objective and subjective oral irritation assessments were performed immediately after dosing and at one hour after placebo dose administration. A fast was maintained until at least four hours after placebo dosing. During the study confinement period, fluid consumption resumed at no sooner than one hour after dose administration. When fluids are not restricted, they were allowed ad libitum. Subjects were not allowed to brush their teeth and tongue for the first two hours after dosing. Lunch was provided at study hour 4.25 after placebo dose administration. Dinner was provided at study hour 10.25 after placebo dose administration. An evening snack was provided at 10.5 hours prior to dose administration on Day 1. At 2300 hours (±30 minutes), saliva pH was measured prior to nighttime teeth and tongue brushing. Subjects were instructed to go to bed after completing this assessment. Subjects began fasting at least ten hours prior to dosing on Day 1. Day 1 Prior to dosing, the following activities were completed: Collected supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate.Measured saliva pH before subject brushed their teeth and the tongue.Subjects brushed their teeth and tongue prior to dose administration.Measured saliva pH after subject brushed their teeth and tongue.Collected a pre-dose 0 hour blood sample for pharmacokinetic analysis.Measured saliva pH within 15 minutes prior to dose administration.Assessed the oral cavity for baseline oral irritation.No fluid, except that given with reference drug administration, was allowed from one hour prior to dose administration until one hour after dosing. Each subject was dosed sequentially with one dose (1×14 mg/0.12 mL oral spray, 2×14 mg/0.12 mL oral spray, 3×14 mg/0.12 mL oral spray, or 1×25 mg tablet) in each of the four dosing periods for a total of four doses per subject.

Subjects were not allowed to lie down (except as directed by Clinical staff secondary to adverse events) for the first four hours after dosing. Subjects did not engage in any strenuous activity while confined to the clinic and followed the rules governing their activities as set forth by the clinic.Lunch was provided at study hour 4.25.Dinner was provided at study hour 10.25An evening snack was provided at study hour 14.25.Blood sample collections were obtained as per the profile.Supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate were measured at approximately one hour after each dose.An electrocardiogram was measured at approximately one hour after each dose.All subjects were evaluated for the presence of any adverse events. Day 2 Blood sample collections were obtained as per the profile.Supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate was measured at approximately 24 hours after each dose.All subjects were evaluated for the presence of any adverse events prior to release from the study site.Prior to release, subjects were evaluated to ensure it was safe for them to be released from the study site.Subjects were released from the study site at approximately 24 hours after dose administration. Oral Irritation Assessments Immediately prior to the first dose (0 hour) of each oral spray treatment, including placebo administration and at time intervals as specified below, each volunteer's oral cavity was assessed for local irritation. Local irritation was evaluated relative to the zero hour observation. Whenever possible, the same evaluator performed all of the evaluations for a single subject throughout all study periods. If irritation was found, a specific description defining the location, degree, and extent of irritation was given. Irritation assessment information and time to irritation resolution was recorded in the CRF. Irritation Assessment Schedule Irritation assessments were collected at the following time points: Prior to each oral spray administration, immediately after swallowing (2 minutes), and at 1 hour post administration. If any irritation persisted beyond the one hour assessment, assessments continued every two hours until resolution up to ten hours post-dose. If irritation was still reported at ten hours, the subject was assessed by the Investigator as to whether the subject should be discontinued from the study. Any assessments after one hour also included a subjective evaluation question. Irritation Assessment The examination consisted of a visual inspection/evaluation of the soft tissue for irritation of the labial and buccal mucosa and tongue. The time and date of these examinations was recorded. A small flashlight or other similar device was used to facilitate the examinations. The oral mucosa surfaces, right and left, and labial junctions and tongue were examined for irritation and graded according to the following classification system. Irritation Assessment Scale Numerical Grade Erythema—Oral Mucosa (Left and Right) and Tongue 0 No erythema 1 Very slight erythema (barely perceptible) 2 Slight erythema (edges of area well defined by definite raising) 3 Moderate erythema (raised approximately 1.0 mm) 4 Severe erythema (raised more than 1.0 mm extending beyond the area of exposure) Study Subjects Disposition of Subjects Twenty-eight (28) volunteers checked in for Period I and a total of 24 subjects were enrolled. The study was conducted with 24 (23 completed) healthy adult males. Subjects checked into the clinical facility on 30 Jul. 2010 for Period I, on 6 Aug. 2010 for Period II, on 13 Aug. 2010 for Period III, and on 20 Aug. 2010 for Period IV. Check-in occurred two days prior to dose administration for Period I and one day prior to dose administration for Periods II, III, and IV. The subjects remained confined at the clinical facility until after the 24-hour blood sample collection of each period. Table 6.1-1 presents all discontinued subjects, the reason(s) for discontinuation, and time points during the study at which each subject was discontinued.

Twenty-four (24) subjects began the study and 23 subjects completed the clinical portion of the study in its entirety. Data for all 24 subjects were used in the statistical analysis for sildenafil and N-desmethylsildenafil for the Test Product A (1 Spray; 10 mg) versus Reference Product D (1 Tablet, 25 mg) comparisons and Test Product C (3 Sprays; 30 mg) versus Reference Product D (1 Tablet, 25 mg) comparisons. Subject 24 elected to withdraw from the study prior to Period IV check-in due to a schedule conflict. Data for 23 of 24 subjects were used in the statistical analysis for sildenafil and N-desmethylsildenafil for the Test Product B (2 Sprays; 20 mg) versus Reference Product D (1 Tablet, 25 mg) comparisons. Actual times were used in the calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. Bioanalytical Method Summary The bioanalytical laboratory of Cetero Research—Toronto determined the sildenafil and N-desmethylsildenafil plasma concentrations. The analysis was performed on a Micromass Quattro Ultima LC/MS/MS system, equipped with Z-spray. The positive ions were measured in MRM mode. The analyte was quantitated using a liquid-liquid extraction procedure. Following extraction, a 20 μL aliquot was injected onto an LC/MSIMS system. The data was acquired by, and calculated on, Micromass “Mass lynx” software version 4.1. Linear regression with 1/x2 weighting was used to obtain the best fit of the data for the calibration curve. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 1.000/0.2500 ng/mL and the upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) was 300.0/75.00 ng/mL for sildenafill N-desmethylsildenafil. Calibration curve standards and quality control (QC) samples for sildenafil and N-desmethylsildenafil met the acceptance criteria for the runs used for the final data, demonstrating satisfactory performance of the method during the analysis of study subject samples. Pharmacokinetic Results and Tabulations of Individual Subject Data Statistical Analytical Issues The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using WinNonlin®, Version 5.0.1, software designed specifically for analyzing pharmacokinetic data. WinNonlin® Model 200 for extravascular input was utilized. An Analysis of Variance (ANOV A) was performed on each of the pharmacokinetic parameters using SAS® software. The ANOV A model containing factors for sequence of products, subjects within sequence, periods and products was utilized in comparing the effects between the test and reference products. Handling of Dropouts or Missing Data Plasma level data from subjects who completed the study were included in the final data analysis. Plasma level data from subjects who withdrew or were discontinued for any reason were not used in the final analysis. Data from subjects with missing concentration values (e.g., missed blood draws, lost samples, samples unable to be quantified) were used if pharmacokinetic parameters could be estimated using remaining data points; otherwise, data from these subjects were excluded from the final analysis. Pharmacokinetic Results Sildenafil (Non-Dose-Adjusted) Table 7.2.6.1-1 summarizes the non-dose-adjusted sildenafil pharmacokinetic parameters for each product using noncompartmental analysis.

In general, when oral spray sildenafil 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg test products were administered to healthy adult males, the overall extent of sildenafil exposure and peak plasma concentrations, as assessed by mean AUC and Cmax, respectively, increased proportionally with increasing doses from 10 mg to 30 mg. For all treatments, maximum sildenafil concentrations tended to be rapidly reached by approximately 1.00 hour after dose. The mean terminal half-lives values were, in general, similar for all four treatments, with estimated mean half-lives between 2.25 and 3.14 hours. Tables 7.2.6.1-2, 7.2.6.1-3, and 7.2.6.1-4 summarize the results of the analyses performed on the pharmacokinetic parameters for non-dose-adjusted sildenafil.

The peak plasma concentrations, as assessed by Cmax, were comparable across all test doses (oral spray of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg) to the reference dose (oral tablet of 25 mg). For all treatments, the peak plasma concentrations ranged from 103.26 ng/mL-111.19 ng/mL.

The upper limit of the 90% CI was 124% for Test A (10 mg) and Test C (30 mg) doses, just below the 125% upper limit. The Test/Reference ratio point estimates for the dose-adjusted AUC0-t for all the sildenafil oral spray doses were approximately 112% to 121%. The upper limit of the 90% CI was 123% for Test A (10 mg) and 125% for Test C (30 mg) doses. For the Test B (20 mg) oral spray, the point estimates for AUCs were approximately 21% higher and the 90% CI for AUCs were above the upper acceptance range at 132%. These data indicate that the overall systemic sildenafil exposure for the oral spray test product is more systemically bioavailable than the 25 mg oral tablet reference product, likely due to avoiding first pass metabolism through transmucosal absorption.

For all doses of the sildenafil oral spray treatments, the time to reach maximum N-desmethylsildenafil concentrations was slightly slower than the oral tablet reference product Tmax of 0.75 hours; however, the ranges of Tmax for all test sildenafil oral sprays and the reference oral tablet were similar. The mean terminal half-life values were, in general, similar for all four treatments.

However, the dose-adjusted peak N-desmethylsildenafil plasma concentrations, as assessed by Cmax, were similar for the test oral spray doses of 20 mg and 30 mg, but slightly less for the test oral spray dose of 10 mg.

Dose Proportionality The results for dose proportionality at doses of single 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg oral spray administrations of sildenafil demonstrate that, while the AUCinf increases linearly with dose, it does not do so in exactly a dose proportional manner; specifically, a slightly greater than dose-proportional increase is observed. As the results in the Table 7.2.6.5-1 demonstrate, a mean 2.24 and 3.13 fold increase in AUCinf is observed from 1 to 2 sprays and 1 to 3 sprays, respectively. Similar greater than non-proportional dose results following single oral dose administration of sildenafil tablets in healthy male volunteers have been reported by Nichols et al. and, as noted in that study and in this study, the extent of this non-proportionality is unlikely to be clinically significant.

The M/P ratio for each concentration time point was calculated for each treatment and plotted versus time to visually assess the rate of formation of metabolite. This was done up to four hours post-dose. This plot is shown in Figure 7.2.6.6-1. It can be noted that there was an immediate peak in the M/P ratio for the reference oral tablet, whereas the M/P ratio with time for all doses of the test oral spray doses were significantly slower than the reference tablet. This observation indicates that there is a marked decrease in the rate of metabolite formation in the test oral spray products compared to the reference oral tablet product and indicative that the test oral spray is, for the most part, bypassing first pass metabolism due to transmucosal absorption. Saliva pH Assessments The transmucosal absorption of drugs may be dependent on the pH of the oral cavity when administered to patients. Therefore, in this study saliva pH was measured in healthy male adult volunteers at 2300 hours (±30 minutes) on Day −1 and on Day 1 within 30 minutes prior to teeth and tongue brushing. There was minimal change in saliva pH pre- and post-teeth and tongue brushing. Saliva pH was then measured within 30 minutes of completion of teeth and tongue brushing (˜45 minutes pre-dose), and within 15 minutes prior to dosing. The pH was measured using pH test strips with a range of 5-9. No subject had a pH of 5, therefore, there was no additional testing with pH test strips with a range of 0-6. There were no appreciable differences found in saliva pH between treatments or periods at 45 minutes and 15 minutes prior to dose administration, as shown in the Table 7.2.7-1.

The oral mucosal surfaces, right and left, and labial junctions and tongue were examined for irritation and graded according to the following classification system described below. Numerical Grade Erythema—Oral Mucosa (Left and Right) and Tongue0 No erythema1 Very slight erythema (barely perceptible)2 Slight erythema (edges of area well defined by definite raising)3 Moderate erythema (raised approximately 1.0 mm)4 Severe erythema (raised more than 1.0 mm extending beyond the area of exposure) Evaluation of soft tissue irritation within the labial or buccal mucosa and of the tongue were done after both active and placebo dosing. Irritation assessments were collected at the following time points: Prior to each oral spray administration, immediately after swallowing (2 minutes), and at 1 hour post administration. If any irritation persisted beyond the one hour assessment, assessments continued every two hours until resolution up to ten hours post-dose. If irritation was still reported at ten hours, the subject was assessed by the Investigator as to whether the subject should be discontinued from the study. Any assessments after one hour also included a subjective evaluation question. The results of the oral irritation assessment found no oral irritation following administration of placebo (3 sprays). Additionally, no oral irritation was found following administration of Test A (1 spray), Test B (2 sprays), or Test C (3 sprays), when observed immediately after administration (held for two minutes, then swallowed), and when observed at 1 hour post-dose. Discussion The dose-adjusted Cmax values of sildenafil for oral spray products Test A (10 mg), Test B (20 mg), and Test C (30 mg) were, in general, comparable to the Reference D (25 mg) oral tablet. The Test/Reference ratio point estimates for the dose-adjusted AUCs for all the sildenafil oral spray doses were approximately 112% to 121% and the 90% CI for AUCs were 124% to 132% with an upper acceptance range of 125%. In addition, the non-dose-adjusted point estimates for AUCs for the Test B 2 spray dose (20 mg) oral spray were approximately 97%, demonstrating comparable bioavailability to the Reference D (25 mg) oral tablet. These data indicate that the overall sildenafil exposure for the test oral spray product is more systemically bioavailable than the reference oral tablet, likely due to avoiding first pass metabolism through transmucosal absorption. Sildenafil is known to be metabolized to its major metabolite N-desmethylsildenafil through first pass metabolism by more than 50% [absolute bioavailability is 41% (range 25-63%)]. The pharmacokinetic and statistical results following administration of the sildenafil oral spray in healthy adult male subjects demonstrated increased systemic exposure that can reasonably be attributed to oral transmucosal absorption processes. The assessment of M/P ratio (metabolite (N-desmethylsildenafil) to parent (sildenafil) ratio) for the oral spray products Test A (10 mg), Test B (20 mg), and Test C (30 mg) as compared to the Reference D (25 mg) oral tablet demonstrated differences in the rate of formation of the metabolite indicative of trans mucosal absorption. There was minimal change found in the mean saliva pH between treatments and periods in this study, therefore subject saliva pH was not likely a contributing factor in the apparent transmucosal absorption observed following the oral spray administration. There was no oral irritation observed in any of the subjects following administration of sildenafil oral spray placebo or active doses (up to 3 sprays, 30 mg dose). Overall, sildenafil citrate was well tolerated in doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, and was well tolerated as a single oral dose of 25 mg (1×25 mg tablet) administered to healthy adult subjects under fed conditions. Example 4 Objective The objective of the following was to evaluate the partial AUC exposures of sildenafil in the first, fourth, twelfth and twenty-fourth hour (AUC0-1, AUC0-4, AUC0-12 and AUC0-24) for the 10, 20 and 30 mg Test oral spray products to that of the 25 mg tablet Reference product of sildenafil. Study Design A randomized, four-way crossover design was used in this study to compare the relative bioavailability (rate and extent of absorption) of one test product at three different dose levels (10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg) with one reference product under fasting conditions. In this study, one test formulation at three different dose levels (10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg of an oral dose of Sildenafil Citrate Oral Spray 14 mg/0.12 mL were compared with VIAGRA® 25 mg Tablets. Twenty-four healthy male adult subjects and no alternates were randomly assigned to one of four sequences of the following products: Test Product (A): Sildenafil Citrate Oral Spray 11.55% w/w;(1 Spray; 10 mg)Test Product (B): Sildenafil Citrate Oral Spray 11.55% w/w;(2 Spray; 20 mg)Test Product (C): Sildenafil Citrate Oral Spray 11.55% w/w;(3 Spray; 30 mg)Reference Product (D): Viagra® tablets 25 mg;The four sequences were as follows: Sequence 1=ABC DSequence 2=BDA CSequence 3=CAD BSequence 4=DCB A A single oral dose of test or reference product was administered to volunteers on four separate occasions under fasting conditions with at least a 3-day washout period between doses. Food and fluid intake were controlled during each confinement period. The pharmacokinetic parameters for both non-dose adjusted and dose adjusted AUC0-1, AUC0-4, AVC0-12 and AUC0-24 of sildenafil and its metabolite, N-desmethylsildenafil were calculated using WinNonlin®, Version 5.0.1, software designed specifically for analyzing pharmacokinetic data. WinNonlin® Model 200 for extravascular input was utilized. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on each of the partial AVC0-1, AUC0-4, AUC0-12 and AUC0-24 pharmacokinetic parameters using SAS® software. The ANOVA model containing factors for sequence of products, subjects within sequence, periods and products was utilized in comparing the effects between the test and reference products. AUC0-24 calculation for majority of the subjects could not be calculated due to BLQ concentration values at hour 24. Pharmacokinetic Results and Discussion Table 1 presents a summary of the sildenafil pharmacokinetic parameters for each product using noncompartmental analysis.

The extent of sildenafil exposure as calculated to one hour (AUC0-1) was approximately 63% lower while AUC calculated to 4 and 12 hours were approximately 55% lower, respectively, than the Tablet Reference product consistent with the dose difference. (Refer to Table 2).the extent of exposure as calculated to 4 and 12 hrs (for non-dose adjusted AUC0-4, AUC0-12) Test product B (2 oral sprays, 20 mg dose) were comparable to the 25 mg tablet Reference D product as these values were within the 90% CI. However, partial AUC calculated to 1 hr was not contained within the 90% CI, although the point estimate was only slightly lower at approximately 10%.

These differences were also essentially independent of the Test as dose (1 spray, 2 sprays and 3 sprays) as only minimal differences were seen between numbers of sprays. There was essentially no difference in partial AUC M/P ratio seen for the AUC0-4 and AUC0-12 hour intervals. Discussion The partial AUC assessment indicates that the most substantive difference between the sildenafil OS and the reference Viagra® tablet occurs at AUC (0-1) interval. There are then no substantive differences found in the partial AUC intervals 0-4, 0-12 and 0-24 between the test OS and the reference tablet. This was again demonstrated with the ratio of metabolite/parent where the most substantive difference is seen for AUC (0-1) interval. These differences were also essentially independent of the sildenafil OS dose (1 spray, 2 sprays and 3 sprays). REFERENCES Food and Drug Administration.
