The present invention relates to an anti-inflammatory topical treatment that is applied, for example, as a cream, ointment, foam, or via a patch, or via a composition-infused fabric, or the like. Certain herbal extracts have been clinically shown to be effective in treating or ameliorating certain conditions of the mouth. Described in WO 02/094300 and US 7,285,295 are a number of useful combinations of herbal extracts for treating or ameliorating diseases of mucosa, and dosage forms for delivering the extracts to discrete regions of the mouth. For example, such combinations, in the delivery form described in US 7,285,295, have achieved, in an 80 patient trial, an average of 50% pain reduction in the first ½ hour. In the same trial, average lesion reductions of 40% were achieved in 4 hours. These types of herbal actives are not believed to have achieved substantial application as topical agents for treating topical lesions or other indications having inflammatory aspects. Similarly, quaternary ammonium surfactants, such as particularly cetylpyridinium chloride, have been used widely in oral rinses as antimicrobials. Applicants, however, have found that an oral rinse comprising an effective amount of appropriate herbal actives and an antimicrobially effective amount of a quaternary ammonium compound that is surface active is surprisingly effective in ameliorating gingivitis. The herbal actives without the quaternary ammonium compound are, in this format, marginally effective in diminishing experimental gingivitis created by subjects failing to brush for two or three weeks. Quaternary ammonium compound alone is marginally effective. The two types of agents together, however, are markedly more effective than is just the quaternary ammonium component. Against the backdrop of the effectiveness of the herbal actives alone, the marked increase in effectiveness in ameliorating gingivitis is more than additive. Given this result, Applicants conclude that other topical indications, such as those implicating mixed inflammatory and microbial etiologies, can be treated with the combination. Provided herein are topical treatments in various compositional formats that ameliorate topical indications. Summary of the Invention Provided, among other things, is a method of treating or ameliorating an indication of non-mucosal topical tissue comprising periodically applying to such disease affected tissue a composition comprising: an effective amount of an appropriate composition of herbal bioactive comprising active(s) of one or more of Sambucus nigra, Centella asiatica or Echinacea purpurea, and an effective amount of a quaternary ammonium surfactant. For example, the quaternary ammonium surfactant can comprise a 1-alkylpyridinium salt, where alkyl is C8-C36 (such as a cetylpyridinium salt). The composition can be applied, for example, as a film, patch. The active(s) of one or more of Sambucus nigra, Centella asiatica or Echinacea purpurea can, for example, comprise an antiinflammatory amount. Further provided is a lotion, gel, cream, ointment or suppository comprising: an effective amount of appropriate composition of herbal bioactive comprising active(s) of one or more of Sambucus nigra, Centella asiatica or Echinacea purpurea; and an effective amount of a quaternary ammonium surfactant. The herbal bioactive can comprise, for example, active(s) of Sambucus nigra comprises 20 to 100% by weight of plant active solids in the composition. The herbal bioactive can comprise, for example, active(s) of a second plant extract from 1 to 50% by weight of plant active solids in the composition. Also provided is a method of treating or ameliorating acne; contact or atopic dermatitis; impetiginized eczema; nummular eczema; endogenous chronic infectious dermatitis; stasis dermatitis; pyoderma; nuchal eczema and chronic eczematoid otitis externa; acne urticata; localized or disseminated neurodermatitis; lichen simplex chronicus; anogenital pruritus (vulvae, scroti, ani); folliculitis; bacterial dermatoses; mycotic dermatoses such as tinea (capitis, cruris, corporis, pedis, versicolor); monliasis; intertrigo; pseudomonas infections; ecthyma, candidiasis; herpes simplex lesions; dermatophytoses; staphylococcal infections (e.g., staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome); proctitis; hidradenitis suppurativa; intertrigo; rhinisitis; sinusitis; scabies; cutaneous larva migrans (hookworm); tinea (ringworm); urinary tract infections; or cutaneous penile lesions, comprising periodically applying to such disease affected tissue a composition comprising: an effective amount of an appropriate composition of herbal bioactive comprising active(s) of one or more of Sambucus nigra, Centella asiatica or Echinacea purpurea, and an effective amount of a quaternary ammonium surfactant. Further provided, among other things, is a method of treating or ameliorating a wound comprising periodically applying to the wound a composition comprising: an effective amount of an appropriate composition of herbal bioactive comprising active(s) of one or more of Sambucus nigra, Centella asiatica or Echinacea purpurea, and an effective amount of a quaternary ammonium surfactant. Detailed Description of the Invention 1 . Herbal Bioactives Appropriate herbal bioactive compositions for use in the device include extract of Sambucus nigra (SN), and/or plant extracts of Allium sativum (AS), Calendula officinalis (CO), Camellia sinensis (CS), Centella asiatica (CA, also known as Gotu Kola), Commiphora molmol (CM), Echinacea purpurea (EP), Gaultheria procumbens (GP), Hypericum perforatum (HP), Krameria triandra (KT), Ligusticum porterii-osha (LP), Matricaria recutita, Melissa officinalis, Salix alba, Thymus vulgaris, Uncaria tomentosa, Usnea barbata or Vaccinium myrtillus. The herbal bioactive compositions can include, for example, Sambucus nigra extract in an amount from one of the lower percentages (by weight) recited in the next sentence to 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100%. These lower percentages are 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90 or 95%. If a second or third herbal bioactive is present, it may be present, for example in amount from one of the lower percentages to one of the higher percentages recited in the following sentences. Lower percentages for the second or third extracts can be, for example, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 or 20%. Higher percentages can be, for example, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50%. These ranges, and any other ranges described in this application, can include or exclude one or both endpoints. The herbal bioactive can be a herbal extract. The term "extract" is used herein to include all of the many types of preparations containing an effective amount of active ingredients. Thus, the extracts can be produced by cold extraction techniques using a variety of different extraction solvents including, but not limited to, water, fatty solvents (such as olive oil), and alcoholic solvents (e. g. 70% ethanol). Cold extraction techniques are typically applied to softer parts of the plant such as leaves and flowers, or in cases where the desired active components of the plant are heat labile. Alternatively, hot extraction techniques, where such solvents are heated to a temperature above room temperature, can be used with the precise value of said temperature being dependent on factors such as the properties of the chosen solvent and extraction efficacy. Hot extraction techniques are more commonly applied to the harder, tougher parts of the plant, such as bark, woody branches and larger roots. In some cases, sequential extractions need to be performed in more than one solvent, and at different temperatures. Standard procedures for producing plant extracts (including hot extraction, cold extraction and other techniques) are described in many publications including"Medicinal plants: a field guide to the medicinal plants of the Land of Israel" (in Hebrew), author: N. Krispil, Har Gilo, Israel, 1986 and "Making plant medicine", author: R. Cech, pub. by Horizon Herbs, 2000.

In some embodiments the herbal bioactive can be one or more flavonoids, isoflavonoids, tocopherols, polyphenols, or similar agents often found in herbal extracts. Flavonoids can include, for example, flavonols or flavonolols [such as, without limitation, a rutoside: rutin (quercitin 3-O-rutino-side), quercitrin (quercetin 3-O-rhamnoside), isoquercitrin (quercetin 3-O-glucoside), diosmin (diosmetin 7.beta.-rutinoside), astragalin (kaempferol 3-O-glucoside), kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside, myricitrin (or myricetin 3-O-rhamnoside), robinin (or kaempferol 3-O-robinoside 7-rhamnoside), kaempferitrin (or kaempferol 3,7-O-dirhamnoside), nobiletin, tangeretin]. Or, flavonoids can include, for example, flavones [such as, without limitation, rhoifolin (or apigenin 7-O-neohesperido-side), luteolin 7-O-glucoside, scutellarin (or scutellarein 5-O-glucoside), pectolinarin (or pectolinarigenin 7-O-rutoside), galuteolin (or luteolin 5-O-glucoside), acaciin (or acacetin 7-O-rhamnoglucoside)]. Or, flavonoids can include, for example, flavanones [such as, without limitation, liquiritin (or liquiritin 4'-O-glucoside), naringin (or naringenin 7-O-neohesperido-side), hesperidin (or hesperetin 7-O-rut-inoside), eriodictin (or eridictiol 7-O-rhamnoside)]. Isoflavonoids can include, for example: formononetin 7-O-glucoside (or ononin), afromosin 7-O-glucoside (or wistin), genistein (or genistein 7-O-glucoside), daidzin, glycitin, genistein 6-O-malonylglucoside, daidzein 6-O-malonylglucoside, genistein 6-O-acetyl-glucoside, iridin (or irigenin 7-O-glucoside), irisolone, tectoridin (or tectorigenin 7-O-glucoside) or shekanin. If any one of these specific bioactive agents is included in the composition it can be used in an amount corresponding to the amount found in one of the above-described extracts. 2. Antimicrobial Agents Antimicrobial quaternary ammonium surfactants can include, for example, 1-alkylpyridinium salts, where alkyl is C8-C36 (or C8-C20, or C10-C20), and wherein the carbon ring members can be substituted with up to two C1-C7 alkyl groups. For example, the composition can include cetylpyridinium chloride. In some embodiments, the quaternary ammonium compound(s) typically contribute amounts to the compositions from one of the following lower endpoints or from one of the following upper endpoints. The lower endpoints are 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.05 weight percent. The upper endpoints are 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.25, 0.15, 0.14, 0.13, 0.12, 0.11, 0.10, 0.09 and 0.08 weight percent. Such quaternary amines are traditionally used for their antiseptic action against bacteria and other microorganisms. In the treatments described herein, such antimicrobial activity may or may not be the primary mode of action for a given indication. However, an antimicrobial amount is believed to provide a good stand-in for determining how much compound to formulate. In some part, and in some embodiments, it is believed that the therapeutic effect is due to the cleansing action of antimicrobial quaternary amines. Or, in some part, and in some embodiments, it may be that the unexpectedly greater activity seen is an enhancement of the anti-inflammatory action of the herbal components by the antimicrobial quaternary amine. 4 . Exemplary Topical Indications The compositions of the invention can be used for the relief of dermatoses and similar topical indications that may be complicated by fungal, bacterial or parasitic colonization, or viral infection. Such microbial infection, if present, can be causative or secondary to the dermatosis. For wounds (including abrasions and bed sores), the compositions of the invention are believed to speed healing, and provide wound cleansing. The anti-inflammatory properties of the compositions are believed to be well suited for ameliorating pressure ulcers (bed sores). Examples include acne; contact or atopic dermatitis; impetiginized eczema; nummular eczema; endogenous chronic infectious dermatitis; stasis dermatitis; pyoderma; nuchal eczema and chronic eczematoid otitis externa; acne urticata; localized or disseminated neurodermatitis; lichen simplex chronicus; anogenital pruritus (vulvae, scroti, ani); folliculitis; bacterial dermatoses; mycotic dermatoses such as tinea (capitis, cruris, corporis, pedis, versicolor); monliasis; intertrigo; pseudomonas infections; ecthyma, candidiasis; herpes simplex lesions; dermatophytoses; staphylococcal infections (e.g., staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome); proctitis; hidradenitis suppurativa; intertrigo; rhinisitis; sinusitis; scabies; cutaneous larva migrans (hookworm); tinea (ringworm); urinary tract infections; cutaneous penile lesions (such as balanitis zerotica obliterans, penile lichen planus, or the like); and the like. In ameliorating acne, the compositions may reduce the growth of bacteria in the follicle (e.g., Propionibacterium acnes or Staphylococcus epidermidis), or may act to keep skin pores clear, or may act to reduce inflammation. For the purposes of this specification, acne includes all known types of acne. Types of acne include, for example, acne vulgaris, cystic acne, acne atrophica, bromide acne, chlorine acne, acne conglobata, acne cosmetica, acne detergicans, epidemic acne, acne estivalis, acne fulminans, halogen acne, acne indurata, iodide acne, acne keloid, acne mcchanica, acne papulosa, pomade acne, premenstral acne, acne pustulosa, acne scorbutica, acne scrofulosorum, acne urticata, acne varioliformis, acne venenata, propionic acne, acne excoriee, gram negative acne, steroid acne, nodulocystic acne and acne rosacea. The treatments of the invention are applicable to all topical surfaces. In certain embodiments, the treatments are well suited for use on non- mucosal surfaces. Without being bound by theory, Applicants note that microbes, even symbiotic microbes, are thought to release microbial mediators of inflammation or trigger the release of cytokine. Accordingly, by reducing this stress at an affected tissue, the antimicrobial component of the compositions can have an ameliorative effect even when the indication in question does not have a strong microbial component. 5. Exemplary Formulation Formats The compositions of the invention can be formulated in any of the many compositions used in topical or mucosal treatments. For example, the compositions can be formulated as baths or soaks, solutions, lotions, gels, creams, ointments, suppositories, dressings adapted to release the compositions, instillation solutions, foams, or the like. In certain embodiments, the compositions are applied in reservoir or adhesive patches, or in films (such as described in US2007/149902). In certain embodiments, the combination is formulated in a lotion, gel, cream, ointment or suppository. 6. Other Dosage Forms In certain embodiments, the composition is administered in conjunction with another administration form, such as a film, patch or mucoadhesive solid dosage form. This solid dosage form can be applied before, concurrently, or after administration of the composition. The solid forms can help deliver medicament to more severely affected, or more mechanically accessible tissue, while the composition delivers medicament elsewhere. The medicament in the solid form can be the same or different from that of the compositions of the invention. However, herbal extracts and extract mixtures as described above are usefully employed. For example, the dosage forms described in WO 02/094300 and US 7,285,295 can be employed. Or, the film described in the an application, filed June 20, 2007, titled "Anti-Inflammatory Dissolvable Film", Serial No. 11/765,587, can be employed. In certain embodiments, the other dosage form is adapted for systemic administration, such as by oral dosage form or by i.v. For example, the other dosage form may be a systemically administered antibiotic. 7.

Other anti-inflammatory agents useful in the compositions include the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. The variety of compounds encompassed by this group are well-known to those skilled in the art. For detailed disclosure of the chemical structure, synthesis, side effects, etc. of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, reference can be had to standard texts, including Anti-inflammatory and Anti-Rheumatic Drugs, K. D. Rainsford, Vol. I-III, CRC Press, Boca Raton, (1985), and Anti-inflammatory Agents, Chemistry and Pharmacology 1, R. A. Scherrer, et al., Academic Press, New York (1974). Specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents useful in the composition invention include, but are not limited to: 1) the oxicams, such as piroxicam, isoxicam, tenoxicam, sudoxicam, and CP-14,304; 2) the salicylates, such as aspirin, disalcid, benorylate, trilisate, safapryn, solprin, diflunisal, and fendosal; 3) the acetic acid derivatives, such as diclofenac, fenclofenac, indomethacin, sulindac, tolmetin, isoxepac, furofenac, tiopinac, zidomctacin, acematacin, fentiazac, zomepirac, clindanac, oxepinac, felbinac, and ketorolac; 4) the fenamates, such as mefenamic, meclofenamic, flufenamic, niflumic, and tolfenamic acids; 5) the propionic acid derivatives, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, benoxaprofen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, fenbufcn, indopropfen, pirprofen, carprofen, oxaprozin, pranoprofen, miroprofen, tioxaprofen, suprofen, alminoprofen, and tiaprofenic; 6) the pyrazoles, such as phenylbutazone, oxyphenbutazone, feprazone, azapropazone, and trimethazone; and mixtures of the foregoing. Mixtures of these steroid and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents can be employed, as well as the pharmologically acceptable salts and esters of these agents. For example, etofenamate, a flufenamic acid derivative, is particularly useful for topical application. 8. Mucoadhesives In certain embodiments polymer(s) are added to the compositions of a type, relative amount, and concentration that is mucoadhesive. The term mucoadhesive, as used herein, is a material that adheres to a mucosal tissue surface in-vivo and/or in-vitro. Such adhesion will adherently localize the dosage form onto the mucus membrane and in certain embodiments requires the application of a force of at least about 50 dynes/cm2 to separate the mucoadhesive material from the mucus membrane. Crosslinked polyacrylic acid-moiety-containing polymers and/or polysaccharide gums (e.g. chitosan) can be used to achieve such mucoadhesion. 9. Misc.

Definitions The following terms shall have, for the purposes of this application, the respective meanings set forth below. • effective amount To treat the indications of the invention, an effective amount of a pharmaceutical compound will be recognized by clinicians but includes an amount effective to treat, reduce, alleviate, ameliorate, eliminate or prevent one or more symptoms of the disease sought to be treated or the condition sought to be avoided or treated, or to otherwise produce a clinically recognizable favorable change in the pathology of the disease or condition. Thus, an effective amount can be, for example, an amount that reduces the severity or duration of oral lesions, ulcerations, bleeding, irritation, swelling, erythema, or the like. For the present combination, it will be recognized that an effective amount is an amount that, in the combination, is effective.
