(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(2-methy lthiazol-5-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-(2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(2-methylthiazol-5-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 10c (650 mg, 1.263 mmol) was dissolved in 12 mL of a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and methanol (V/V=5:1), then 6.5 mL of 1 M lithium hydroxide solution was added. After stirring for 2 hours, the reaction was stopped. 10% of citric acid was added dropwise to adjust the pH to 3-4, and 50 mL of ethyl acetate was added. Two phases were separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL). The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-6-(2-methy lthiazol-5-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid 10 (250 mg, yield 40%) as a yellow solid.
