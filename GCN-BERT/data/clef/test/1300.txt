CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/049,782, filed Oct. 9, 2013, and U.S. Design application No. 29/468,950 filed Oct. 4, 2013. The disclosure of each of the aforementioned patent applications is incorporated by reference in its entirety for any purpose whatsoever. BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Disclosed Embodiments The disclosed embodiments relate to cosmetic products, including pressed cosmetic powder cakes and corresponding containers and embodiments of a cosmetic case in which the corresponding container is inserted into. 2. Background of the Disclosure A variety of cosmetic products including pressed powder cakes and the like are known in the art. The present disclosure provides devices and methods that advance over the current state of the art. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSED EMBODIMENTS In general, in a first aspect, the disclosure features a cosmetic product, including a pressed cosmetic powder cake. The pressed cosmetic powder cake has a depression formed into the cake, such as proximate the center of an upper surface of the cake for receiving a predetermined amount of a liquid. The product further includes a pressed powder cake pan. The pan includes a recess to receive the powder cake. The product also includes a cosmetic case that includes a lower body portion or base and an upper body portion or lid that can be coupled at a hinge, if desired. The lower body portion or base defines an interior cavity therein to receive the powder cake pan. If desired, the lower body portion or base of the container can be configured with a receiving groove formed integrally in the inner circumference of the lower body portion or base. The upper body portion or lid can be configured with an inner surface for receiving a mirror. If desired, the upper body portion or lid can be configured with an outwardly protruding sealing member formed integrally on the outer circumference of the upper body portion or lid. The receiving groove can be configured to receive the outwardly protruding sealing member of the upper body portion or lid allowing for the cosmetic container to be in a closed position. Pressed powder products, such as face powder, eye shadow, blushes or the like have effectively replaced conventional loose powder products. Pressed powder products are produced by compressing loose powder into a metal pan using direct pressure. To make the water and powder mixing task easier for the user when using a brush or sponger application, in one aspect, the disclosure provides a pressed powder cake that is formed with a depression in the pressed powder cake 10 receive a liquid or other material containing liquid (e.g., gel), preferably water. Such depressions can be made with a die of a press, preferably the same press that is used to make the powder cake such that the powder cake and depression are formed during a single operation. The press thus forms a “well” or reservoir in the main body of the pressed powder cake where water droplets can be deposited. The well can be provided with concave walls, as desired, that act to confine the water droplet(s) being placed in the well and prevent the water from rolling off of the pressed powder cake, thereby facilitating use. This is of particular utility when the pressed powder cake is formed from hydrophobic material, which is common. The well can be provided in a variety of shapes and sizes, where the measured diameters, areas, widths or lengths of the depression is a percentage of the overall diameters, areas, widths or lengths of the top surface of the pressed powder cake. For example, round shaped depressions can be configured with a diameter from about 5 percent to about 95 percent of the overall diameter of a round pressed powder cake, in any desired increment of one percent, such as six, seven, eight percent, and so on. The well can have a geometric center in a horizontal plane that coincides with a center of the pressed powder cake in the horizontal plane. In other embodiments, the well can have a geometric center in a horizontal plane that does not coincide with a geometric center of the pressed powder cake in the horizontal plane. In some embodiments, multiple wells can be formed into a pressed powder cake that can be symmetrically distributed with respect to a geometric center of the pressed powder cake. For example, the wells can be distributed in a pattern matching the shape of the powder cake about a geometric center of the powder cake. Thus, for example, a circular or oval powder cake can have a plurality of wells distributed in a circular or oval path about a geometric center of the surface of the pressed powder cake. Similarly, square or rectangular pressed powder cakes can similarly be provided with a plurality of wells of any desired shaped so distributed about the geometric center of the top surface of the pressed powder cake. The wells can be any desired suitable size. Similarly, square shaped depressions can be configured with a width or length ratio that is about five to about ninety five percent of the overall width or length of the square pan in increments of about one percent, and rectangular shaped depressions can be configured with a width or length ratio that is about five to about ninety five percent of the overall width or length of the rectangular pan in increments of about one percent. Pressed cosmetic powders are typically a mix of various free flowing small particle size solids which in combination with liquids are blended and compressed into a compact form. Typical pressed powder formulations include the following functional materials, such as fillers (e.g., talc, mica, and sericite), compression aids (e.g., zinc, magnesium and stearate), texture enhancers that may include ceramic materials or tribological particles (e.g., lauroyl lysine, boron nitride, PTFE), colorants (e.g., iron oxides, titanium dioxide, ultramarines, chromium oxides), organic lakes, liquid binders (e.g., oils, esters, silicones) and preservatives (e.g., parabens, sodium benzoate). The shape of the powder materials varies, and may be platelets to spherical with an average length or diameter anywhere from 0.1-2 microns (e.g., talc & silica) to greater than 150 microns (pearls & glitters). Typical eyeshadow formula compositions can include: % w/w Fillers 30.0-80.0 Compression Aid 2.0-5.0 Texture Enhancers 3.0-30.0 Colorants 2.0-25.0 Pearlescents 0.0-50.0 Binders 3.0-10.0 Preservatives 0.5-1.0 Additional Ingredients qs The pressed cosmetic powder cake mix is typically compressed into a metal pan, such a tin or aluminum pans, using hydraulic presses with steel “punches” or dies. The pressures necessary are formula dependent and typically vary from about 5 bars to 110 bars (in suitable increments, such as of about one bar) with dwell times from about 1 second to about 4 seconds. The powder cake may be compressed once or twice, as desired. The established pressure parameters are selected to ensure the integrity and performance of the final product. The height of the powder case in the pan varies from about 2 mm to about 12 mm, preferably from about 2 mm to about 6 mm. The pressed cosmetic powder cake is specially designed such that the depression or well formed into the powder cake acts as a reservoir to contain liquid or liquid-like material (e.g., gel). The liquid in the depression is mixed with the powder cake with a manual applicator to allow an individual to easily apply a wet mixed powder onto their skin. The depression is preferably formed in such a way that it not only provides a unique aesthetic design, but also serves as an artistic tool to which droplets of water are added to the powder to be used not only as a dry powder but in wet form as well. It is to be understood that the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and are intended to provide further explanation of the disclosed embodiments. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute part of this specification, are included to illustrate and provide a further understanding of the disclosed methods and systems. Together with the description, the drawings serve to explain principles of the disclosure.
