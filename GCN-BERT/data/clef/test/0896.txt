MANAGEMENT OF TRACTIONAL MEMBRANES CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/801,941, filed on March 15, 2013 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention generally relates to compositions and methods for treating diseases and disorders of the eye, such as tractional membranes. The composition of the present invention comprises microbubbles in association with an enzyme or vitreolytic agent. The methods of treatment involve administering a microbubble composition and an enzyme or vitreolytic agent to a subject in need thereof, followed by application of ultrasound. Optionally, the enzyme of vitreolytic agent is associated with the microbubbles. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The vitreous gel (or simply vitreous) of the eye may play an important role in the pathogenesis of various retinal disorders. As the eye ages, it is common for the vitreous to separate from the retina. But if this separation is not complete, the adhesion can create pulling forces on the retina that may result in subsequent loss or distortion of vision. If the disruption to visual acuity is severe enough, it requires treatment. The current standard of care for treating symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion (VMA) is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), which involves surgically removing the vitreous from the eye. Recovery is extensive and often requires patient to remain immobilized “head down” for 7-14 days and be reliant on caregivers. Pharmacologic agents have been used to liquefy the vitreous and complete vitreoretinal separation. A potential vitreolytic agent should be able to facilitate either liquefaction of the vitreous or weakening of the VMA, or ideally both. A number of enzymes have been the subject ofpreclinical and clinical evaluations for use as vitreolytic agents, including chondroitinase, collagenase, dispase, hyaluronidase, nattokinase, plasmin, plasminogen activators and ocriplasmin, (JETREA®, ThromboGenics Inc, generic name for microplasmin). Plasmin is not available for clinical use and is unstable. Therefore, clinical application requires activation of its proenzyme, plasminogen, which in turn is also not commercially available for human use. Ocriplasmin (microplasmin) is a genetically engineered version of plasmin and has been shown in clinical trials to be able to safely release vitreomacular adhesion and close Stage 2 macular holes in a significant number of patients. Microplasmin is now FDA-approved for use in relieving traction in patients with vitreomacular traction. However, the success rate (26%) for the treatment group is not appreciably higher than 10% in the placebo group (Girach Expert Rev Ophthalmol. 2012;7(4):311-323; Stalmans, Ρ. et al., Ν Engl J Med. 2012;367:606-615). What is therefore needed are new treatments for symptomatic VMA that have improved efficacy with good safety profile and reduced cost.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Methods and compositions are provided here to treat diseases or disorders of the eye, such as treating tractional membranes. Methods of preparing such compositions are also provided. The methods described herein advantageously deliver an therapeutic agent, such as an enzyme or vitreolytic agent, to the vitreous more uniformly and homogeneously than the simple intravitreal injection of enzyme. In some instances, this approach can provide a success rate of 100% to relieve vitreomacular traction and induce pharmacologic vitreolysis compared with 26% normally observed for the intravitreal injection of plasmin alone. The methods described herein advantageously use a lower dose of plasmin that methods known in the art. In one embodiment, the methods described herein use approximately a quarter (and potentially even less) of the plasmin dose needed to relieve vitreomacular traction in similar patients. As a result, they are more efficient and also result in cost savings to the patient and healthcare payer compared to using the full dose. Using a lower dose of plasmin also improves retinal safety issues such as occurrence of retinal detachment as compared to administration of a full dose of plasmin thereby improving the safety profile of this therapy. Microbubbles In one aspect, the present invention provides a composition comprising microbubbles, useful in the treatment of diseases and disorders of the eye, such as tractional membranes. Optionally, the microbubbles are associated with a therapeutic agent, such as an enzyme or vitreolytic agent. Microbubbles are tiny, gas-filled bubbles having a solid or semi-solid shell that can be injected into the bloodstream or vitreous where they remain inactive unless stimulated. They are smaller than one millimeter in diameter, but larger than one micrometer. Due to the compressible gas core, microbubbles may provide a sensitive acoustic response They are used in medical diagnostics as a contrast agent for ultrasound imaging. The gas-filled microbubbles oscillate and vibrate when a sonic energy field is applied and may reflect ultrasound waves. This distinguishes the microbubbles from surrounding tissues. In practice, because gas bubbles in liquid lack stability and would therefore quickly dissolve, microbubbles must be encapsulated with a solid or semi-solid shell. In various embodiments, the shell is made from a lipid, fat or protein. Simulation of the microbubbles according to the present invention involves the application of ultrasonic energy or ultrasound. High-frequency ultrasound has been used to create images of bone, tissue and other structures within the body by measuring the speed and intensity with which sound waves bounce off these objects and return as an echo. Ultrasound waves directed at microbubbles cause them to vibrate and return a unique echo within the bloodstream that produces a dramatic distinction, or high "contrast," between blood vessels and surrounding tissue, thus enabling clinicians to visualize areas of restricted blood flow. Specialized Doppler ultrasound, which measures the rate and volume of blood flow, can further pinpoint the extent and severity of blockage caused by blood clots. Microbubbles may also have therapeutic applications and may be filled or associated with therapeutic agents. Methods and apparati for preparing and using microbubbles are described in patent application WO/2009/020994. Various microbubbles may be used in the present methods to effect management of tractional membranes. The microspheres are stable and small enough to pass through the pulmonary capillaries. In a particular embodiment, the microspheres are about 1 to about 5 microns in diameter. In one embodiment, the composition of the present invention comprises microbubbles filled with insoluble perfluorocarbon gas, such as but not limited to, perfluoromethane, perfluoroethane, perfluoropropane, perfluorobutane, perfluoropentane, or a combination thereof, optionally, associated with a therapeutic agent, such as an enzyme (e.g., a proteolytic enzyme) or vitreolytic agent. In a particular embodiment, the composition comprises microbubbles, wherein the microbubble is a lipid-coated microsphere filled with octafluoropropane gas and is optionally associated with a therapeutic agent, such as an enzyme (e.g., a proteolytic enzyme) or vitreolytic agent. The enzyme may be any suitable enzyme, including but not limited to the enzymes disclosed herein. In one particular embodiment, the microbubbles are DEFINITY® microbubbles ( Lantheus Medical Imaging, Inc ). DEFINITY ® microbubbles are lipid-coated microspheres filled with octafluoropropane gas. DEFINITY® does not contain any human or animal materials. The microspheres contained in DEFINITY® have a mean diameter of 1.1 to 3.3 microns (in vitro measurements). Optionally, the DEFINITY® microbubble is coated, filled or otherwise associated with a therapeutic agent, such an enzyme (e.g., a proteolytic agent) or a vitreolytic agent. The enzyme may be any suitable enzyme, including but not limited to the enzymes disclosed herein In another embodiment, the present invention is a composition comprising microbubbles, wherein the microbubble is a perflouropropane gas encapsulated by a serum albumin shell and optionally associated with an enzyme (e.g., a proteolytic enzyme) or a vitreolytic agent. The enzyme may be any suitable enzyme, including but not limited to the enzymes disclosed herein. In a particular embodiment, the microbubbles are OPTISON® microbubbles (GE Healthcare, Inc.) which comprise perfluoropropane gas encapsulated by a serum albumin shell. Optionally, the OPTISON® microbubble is coated, filled or otherwise associated with an enzyme (e.g., a protelytic enzyme) or a vitreolytic agent. The enzyme may be any suitable enzyme, including but not limited to the enzymes disclosed herein. In certain embodiments of the composition, the microbubbles are associated with more than one therapeutic agent. For example, the microbubbles are associated with more than one enzyme or vitreolytic agent. In certain embodiments of the composition, the microbubbles are not unassociated with an enzyme, vitreolytic agent or other therapeutic agent. In certain embodiment, the microbubbles comprises a single layer. In other embodiment, the microbubbles are multi-layered. A representative, non-limiting multiple layer microbubble comprises a gas core, a polymer and lipid shell surrounding the gas core and a surfactant layer surrounding shell. In certain embodiments, the microbubbles are targeted. For example, by attaching a targeting ligand, such as a polysaccharide, monoclonal antibody or peptide, to the shell. Therapeutic Agents In one embodiment, the microbubbles associated with one or more therapeutic agents, such as an enzyme (e.g., a proteolytic enzyme) or a vitreolytic agent. The application of ultrasonic shock waves can activate the microbubbles associated with the therapeutic agents, causing release of the therapeutic agent agent. For example, application of ultrasound may result in mini-ruptures to release the therapeutic agent. Associating the microbubbles with a therapeutic agent, optionally visualizing their presence at the diseased site using the ultrasound diagnostic mode, and then activating the microbubbles to release their contents at the targeted lesion/region can be a powerful and effective way to administer a therapeutic agent uniformly, and homogeneously without harming other areas of the eye or body. As used herein to describe “association” with a microbubble, the term “association” means to be physically in contact with inside or on the surface of a microbubble such that the therapeutic agent is carried by the microbubble into the appropriate intraocular location. The therapeutic agent(s) may be associated with the microbubble by coating on the microbubble surface or being contained (loaded) within the microbubble. In one embodiment, the enzymes are non-covalently joined within or on the surface of or embedded within the wall of the microbubble. In a particular embodiment, the therapeutic agent is associated with the microbubble by binding to the microbubble shell and through attachment of site-specific ligand. All or nearly all of the microbubbles may be associated with the therapeutic agent. Alternatively, only a portion of the microbubbles may be associated with the therapeutic agent. Therapeutic agent-associated microbubbles may be administered to an appropriate site within the body such as the vitreous where they may be subsequently activated with ultrasound applied to the appropriate region of the eye to effect activation. In one embodiment, the microbubbles are associated with an enzyme, such as a proteolytic enzyme. Representative, non-limiting examples of enzymes suitable for use in the compositions or methods of the present invention are chondroitinase, collagenase, dispase, hyaluronidase, nattokinase, plasmin, plasminogen activators and ocriplasmin, (ThromboGenics Inc) (aka microplasmin). Variants and derivatives of these enzymes are also suitable for use. Plasmin, also known as fibrinolysin or lysofibrin, is a serine-type protease which results from the activation of the zymogen plasminogen. Plasmin carries a heavy chain comprising 5 kringle domains and a light chain comprising the catalytic domain. Plasminogen can be enriched from blood plasma, e.g., via lysine affinity-chromatography (Deutsch & Mertz, 1970, Science 170, 1095-1096). Truncation of the plasmin molecule (outside and/or inside the plasmin catalytic domain) is possible as long as the catalytic domain remains functional, such truncation thus results in the formation of a "proteolytically active derivative" of plasmin. As such, one or more of the 5 kringle domains can be deleted wholly or partially. Truncated plasmins lacking one or more kringle domains and/or lacking parts of one or more kringle domains are suitable for use in the compositions and methods of the present invention. Examples of truncated variants of plasmin include, but are not limited to, midiplasmin, miniplasmin, microplasmin, and delta-plasmin. Microplasmin has been approved for VMA resolution. The drug’s enzymatic properties target the architectural components of the vitreous and the adhesion at the vitreoretinal interface, both of which are implicated in the pathogenesis of symptomatic VMA. Microplasmin exerts proteolytic effects on collagen, fibronectin, and laminin to produce vitreous liquefaction and its detachment from the macula (Gandorfer A., et al., Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2004;45:641-7.; Sebag J, Green WR. 2012, Vitreous and the vitreo-retinal interface. In: Ryan SJ, ed. Retina. 5th ed. Oxford, England: Elsevier; 2012). In multiple preclinical models, intravitreal injection of microplasmin consistently and rapidly (within 30 minutes) induced complete vitreous detachment. These experimental results confirmed its potential viability as a pharmacologic treatment of symptomatic VMA. In clinical pharmacokinetic studies, microplasmin was undetectable in the eye within 7 days after a single intravitreal injection. Microplasmin administered intravitreally does not result in detectable levels in the systemic circulation. In studies assessing systemic exposure after intravenous administration in humans, microplasmin was inactivated quickly (within seconds) by a2-antiplasmin. The inactive ocri plasm in/o.2-anti plasm in complex is then cleared from the circulation with a half-life of several hours. Statistical analysis of the combined data demonstrated VMA resolution in 26.5% of microplasmin -injected patients compared with 10.1% in placebo (ρ < 0.001) (Girach et al., Expert Rev Ophthalmol. 2012;7(4):311-323 ). Total posterior vitreous detachment was more prevalent in microplasmin -injected patients (13.4%) compared with placebo-injected patients (3.7%; ρ < 0.001). The methods provided herein offer a success rate of 100% to relieve traction and induce pharmacologic vitreolysis compared with 26% for the microplasmin injection alone. The combination of ultrasound and microbubbles with microplasmin surprisingly reduces the required dose of enzyme for therapeutic benefit. In clinical trials intravitreal microplasmin alone was administered at doses of 25-175 ug. The 125-ug dose was associated with optimal efficacy in the studies with no additional benefit observed with the 175-qg dose or up to 3 monthly injections of 125 qg. The present methods are effective using reduced doses of microplasmin at about 25% of the full dose used in the clinical trials. Effective doses of microplasmin can be reduced when microplasmin is administered together with microbubbles (either at the same time or in associated with microbubbles). In one embodiment, the effective dose of microplasmin is between about 1 and 50 μg. In one embodiment, the effective dose is between about 20-40 μμ and in a particular embodiment, the effective dose of microplasmin is about 30 μμ. In another particular embodiment, the effective dose of microplasmin is about 40 μμ.

The compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. In certain embodiments, the composition of the present invention is suitable for injection into the eye. Injectables for such use can be prepared in conventional forms, either as a liquid solution or suspension or in a solid form suitable for preparation as a solution or suspension in a liquid prior to injection, or as an emulsion. Carriers can include, for example, water, saline (e.g., normal saline (NS), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), balanced saline solution (BSS)), sodium lactate Ringer's solution, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like; and if desired, minor amounts of auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, buffers, and the like can be added. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by using a coating such as lecithin, by maintaining the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by using surfactants. The present invention extends to methods of preparing such microbubble compositions, comprising admixing the components of a microbubble solution and optionally, one or more therapeutic agents. In certain embodiments, an external rocking, vibrating or rotating mechanism may be added to increase mixing efficiency, without the need for an internal mixing device. In a particular embodiment, the composition is prepared by vigorously shaking a vial of microbubble solution for 30-90 seconds on a microbubble shaker. In embodiments where enzymes are to be associated with the microbubbles, an appropriate amount of enzyme or vitrolyetic agent is diluted in balanced salt solution and combined with an appropriate amount of microbubble solution. The enzyme-microbubble mixture or vitreolytic agent-microbubble mixture is vigorously shaken for an additional 30-90 seconds on a microbubble shaker prior to administration.

The stabilizing material may be any material that effects the stability of compositions containing the gases, gaseous precursors, liquids, targeting ligands and/or other therapeutically actives agents (e.g., enzymes) described herein, including, for example, mixtures, suspensions, emulsions, dispersions, vesicles, microspheres or the like. Exemplary stabilizing materials include, for example, lipids, proteins, polymers, carbohydrates and surfactants. The improved stability involves, for example, the maintenance of a relatively balanced condition, and may be exemplified, for example, by increased resistance of the composition against destmction, decomposition, degradation, and the like. In certain embodiments, composition comprises vesicles filled with gases, gaseous precursors, liquids, target ligands and/or therapeutic agents, wherein the stabilizing compounds may serve to either form the vesicles or stabilize the vesicles, in either way serving to minimize or substantially (including completely) prevent the escape of gases, gaseous precursors and/or therapeutic agents from the vesicles until release is desired. Methods of Use In one aspect, the present invention is a method of treating a disease or disorder of the eye in a subject in need thereof, comprising (i) administering the composition of the present invention to a subject in need thereof and (ii) applying ultrasound to active the microbubbles, resulting in complete or partial treatment of the disease or disorder of the eye. The ultrasound may be applied at a predetermined time or during live imaging. As used herein, the term “treatment or “treat” as used herein means any treatment of disease or disorder in a mammal, particularly a human, including: (a) protecting against the disease or disorder, that is, causing the clinical symptoms not to develop; (b) inhibiting the disease or disorder, that is, arresting, ameliorating, reducing, or suppressing the development of clinical symptoms; and/or (c) relieving the disease or disorder, that is, causing the regression of clinical symptoms. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that in human medicine, it is not always possible to distinguish between "preventing" and "suppressing" since the ultimate inductive event or events may be unknown, latent, or the patient is not ascertained until well after the occurrence of the event or events. Therefore, as used herein the term "prophylaxis" is intended as an element of "treatment" to encompass both "preventing" and "suppressing" as defined herein. The term "protection," as used herein, is meant to include "prophylaxis." The "subject” as used herein refer to any mammal, especially a human.

EXAMPLES Example 1: Evaluating efficacy of plasmin-microbubble ultrasound on inducing posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) Animal experiments were performed at the facilities of Doheny Eye Institute on a population of 20 normal age-matched rabbits assigned to 4 experimental groups. The study rationale was to evaluate the possibility of induction of a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) using a reduced dose of plasmin with the advantage of microbubble-assisted ultrasound as a novel mode of ocular delivery. Eyes were submitted to histopathology including H&E slides, scanning electron microscopy, and immunostaining studies after completion of the study. Experimental Groups Group-A (η=5): received intravitreal injection of 100 μ1 microbubble solution (DEFINITY™) followed by 30 minutes of ultrasound application. Group-B (η=5): received intravitreal injection of 100 μ1 of plasmin (100 pg). Group-C (η=5): received intravitreal injection of 100 μ1 of full-dose plasmin (500 pg). Group-D (η=5): received intravitreal injection of 50 μ1 of the plasmin (50 pg) + 50 μ1 MB mixture followed by 30 minutes of ultrasound application. Plasmin-Microbubble Preparation • DEFINITY™ Microbubble vial is placed over the Microbubble shaker and shaken vigorously for 45 seconds • 25 pL Microplasmin is diluted with 25 pL balanced salt solution (BSS) to get a concentration of 1:2 • 50pL DEFINITY™ Microbubbles is added to 50pL of the previous concentration to get a final Microplasmin concentration of 1:4 • Microplasmin-Microbubble admixture will be vigorously shaken for another 45 seconds Intravitreal Injections • Intravitreal injection of 100 pL of the previous concentration using 33-G needle connected to 100pL Hamilton syringe • Injection will be performed using the pars plana route with the needle directed towards the midvitreous cavity • Intravitreal injections were performed in sterile conditions and after instillation of several drops of 5% Povidone iodine. Topical tetracaine drops were applied for additional anesthesia. A speculum was used to keep the eyelids open, and the procedure was performed under direct visualization using an operating microscope and a surgical contact lens. A 30-gauge needle attached to a 1-mL syringe was passed into the midvitreous cavity transconjunctivally, at the upper temporal quadrant of the globe, 2 mm behind the limbus. • At the end of the procedure, topical antibiotic ointment (Neo-Poly-Bac- Bausch & Lomb Inc., Tampa, FL) was applied to the conjunctiva sac. • Application of topical ultrasound gel to the ocular surface Ultrasound settings: 1. Frequency: 8MHz 2. Mechanical index: 0.25 3. Duration: 30 minutes 4. Site of application: direct over the inferior conjunctival surface. Follow-up: 1. Baseline fluorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed at initial visit and again at 1 and 2 weeks after the procedure. 2. Follow-up imaging: every 5 days to a total of 3 visits. Ocular Examination Examinations included evaluation of the anterior segment by slit lamp (Haag-Streit Diagnostics, Gartenstadtstrasse, Switzerland), fluorescein angiography (FA), and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Before each session, the rabbits were anesthetized, and the pupils were dilated as described earlier. Baseline examinations were performed right away before the laser procedure, and follow-up examinations were performed every two weeks after the primary procedure till the end of the eight-week-follow-up period. Optical Coherence Tomography The Spectralis HRA-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) is a high-resolution spectral domain OCT that can simultaneously perform scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. High-resolution horizontal raster 6 x 6-mm scans through the laser-treated lesions. All of the scans were performed using the eye-tracking system. Only the scans that were of sufficient or good quality (>20 dB) and fulfilled OSCAR-IB quality control criteria for OCT scans were included in the study results. The lesion site was examined by OCT, using the single line or raster scan modes. The OCT evaluation of the lesion site was used to identify the presence of reflections in the subretinal space for correlation with histologic data. Fluorescein Angiography The same camera system used for OCT was set for FA by selecting the appropriate settings and filter. An intravenous line was established on the marginal ear vein and 0.2 mL of AK-Fluor® (fluorescein injection 10% - Akom, Abit Springs, LA) was injected and flushed with 1 mL of normal saline. Sequential fundus photographs were taken immediately after fluorescein injection. Late photographs were taken at 3 and 5 minutes. Euthanasia At the end of the last follow-up examination in each group, the rabbits were euthanized by intracardiac injection of 2 mL pentobarbital (Beuthanasia-D; Schering Plough Animal Health, Omaha, ΝΕ). Light Microscopic Examination Enucleated eyes were immersed in Davidson's fixative solution (two eyes from each group) overnight and then dehydrated in a series of graded alcohol solutions over the next 24 to 48 hours before paraffin embedding. Blocks were obtained from cuts through the whole globe oriented perpendicularly to the medullary wings. Sections 5-μηΐ thick were obtained by microtome, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stains, and examined by light microscopy. Retinal regions 4 disc diameters below the optic disc were photographed at the same magnification (Photoshop, version CS4; Adobe, Mountain View, CA). Scanning Electron Microscopy For this purpose, 5 χ 5-mm ocular samples (4 disc diameters below the optic disc) were sectioned from the enucleated eyes after stripping of the neurosensory retina to be fixed in halfstrength Kamovsky's fixative for 2 days. After initial fixation, the specimens were rinsed several times with phosphate buffer then post fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 Μ PBS for 1 hour. After a rinse with PBS, the specimens were dehydrated using a series of graded ethyl alcohol solutions and then chemically dried using hexamethyldisilazane. After drying, the specimens were mounted on aluminum stubs with adhesive tabs and sputter coated for 3 minutes (Polaron; Energy Beam Sciences, Agawam, ΜΑ). Specimens were then viewed under a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6390- JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody, ΜΑ). Results: Treatment groups were compared regarding the success rate of inducing PVD and the incidence of any complications, specifically retinal detachment. Group-A receiving vehicle and ultrasound only, showed no success in inducing PVD and no incidence of retinal detachment. Group Β received 1/4 dose of plasmin without ultrasound showed no success in inducing PVD and no incidence of retinal detachment. Group-C having the full-dose of plasmin without ultrasound showed a 100% success rate in inducing PVD, but had a high incidence (80%) of retinal detachment in the group. Group-D received a 1/4* dose of plasmin with microbubble vehicle and ultrasound and similarly showed 100% success in inducing PVD and 0% retinal detachment. The lower dose of plasmin in the presence of ultrasound shows similar efficacy and better safety profile shown by the absence of retinal detachment after plasmin/microbubble-ultrasound therapy.
