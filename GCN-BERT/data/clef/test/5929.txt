DESCRIPTIVE MEMORY In the electrowinning process of non-ferrous metals from acid solutions in electrolytic cells principally Cu and Ζη- oxygen bubbles are generated on the surfaces of insoluble anodes that ascend to the surface of the electrolyte. It is important to point out that the bubbles in their ascent not only grow in size and increase their velocity, but also capture water and sulfuric acid vapors from the electrolyte, which become incorporated in each bubble. In the case of cells equipped with Soft Aeration System for sparging air into the electrolyte, something similar occurs with the air bubbles diffused near the cell bottoms. Immediately before reaching the surface of the electrolyte, the bubbles contain a mixture of gases (air and oxygen) and vapors (water and sulfuric acid). Upon emerging from the surface of the electrolyte to the atmosphere, the bubbles explode, causing the film or thin enveloping layer of electrolyte to collapse into small fragments that are projected upwards above the surface in the form of airborne very fine drops of electrolyte that accompany the contents of escaping gases and vapors to the surrounding atmosphere, thus forming the complex and problematic Acid Mist. In in the Tankhouse working ambient, Acid Mist constitutes a severe occupational health hazard, and thus its concentration limits in the atmosphere are established in corresponding Health and Work Safety Protocols and Regulations; in addition, it causes multiple well known operational inconveniences, such as equipment corrosion and CuS04 crystallization build ups, that induce current leaks and short-circuits. Therefore it is compulsory to effectively control Acid Mist. To properly address that task, it is pertinent to define conceptually what we understand by Acid Mist, which for the effects of this patent application is considered an airborne mist formed by 2 phases, as follows: 1. A gaseous phase constituted by: a) Permanent gases: oxygen originated in the electrolytic process, and oxygen and nitrogen of the air infiltrated into the cell from the Tankhouse ambient, and air coming from the electrolyte air sparging. b) Vapors of water as well as of sulfuric acid resulting from evaporation of the electrolyte to atmosphere and captured by ascending bubbles through the electrolyte. 2. A liquid phase (electrolyte) dispersed in the gaseous phase in the form of very tiny droplets, due to the projection of particles of electrolyte by collapse of the liquid film that surrounds the surface of the bubbles when they reach the surface of the electrolyte and explode. Furthermore, It must be remembered that in gas handling technology, “vapors” are defined as any component of a gaseous phase that is condensed by simple chilling to temperatures slightly inferior to ambient at atmospheric pressure; and “permanent gases” are any component of a gaseous phase that requires temperatures way below 0° C and pressures substantially above atmospheric pressure to condense or liquefy. Consequently, in this application we shall understand Acid Mist as indicated above, that is to say, simply the mixture of permanent gases (oxygen and nitrogen) and water vapor with very fine airborne droplets of electrolyte and vapors of sulfuric acid, the latter two being the hazardous and dangerous contaminants to the workplace ambient. Present art utilizes various techniques to control Acid mist in the workplace ambient atmosphere, and among them, we can mention the use of confining means over the electrolyte, such as floating plastic balls to diminish the projections of electrolyte droplets, together with porous mesh covers or blankets; and nonporous rigid covers such as hoods placed on top of the cells; however, both types of covers present a series of shortcomings and inconveniences described in Chilean Patent Application № 1056-2013 by the same inventor. Whatever the system used in the cells for confinement of Acid Mist, it must be continuously extracted as otherwise the gases and vapors continuously generated by the electrolytic process would inevitably raise the pressure in the volume of confinement over the electrolyte above the atmospheric pressure of the Tankhouse, thus initiating a leak flow of Acid Mist from the cells to the Tankhouse To avoid the above phenomenon, the extraction must be accompanied by a slight depression in the confinement volume sustained in time, so that the gaseous flow is always from the Tankhouse to the cell and not in reverse, which necessarily implies that there must be a continuous infiltration of outside air from the Tankhouse into the confinement volume in the cell. In the present art systems of Acid Mist control used in industrial Tankhouses, after capture confinement by hoods or other covers, Acid Mist is extracted from the confinement volume in the cells by external suction, and is driven through a network of collector ducts from each cell to centralized cleaning equipment that treats the Acid Mist generated by a plurality of cells in a Tankhouse in one centralized process prior to discharge to the atmosphere. However, present Acid Mist control systems cannot assure continuous sustained compliance of the mandatory maximum content limits of contaminants in the working areas surrounding the cells in the Tankhouse. The present art solution is by simple dilution of the contaminant electrolyte droplets and vapors of sulfuric acid in a very large volume of air infiltrated from the Tankhouse which is sucked into each cell. This solution presents several operational shortcomings and inconveniences, the principal being the high energy requirement necessary to dilute the contaminants with infiltrated air, vacuum up the large resulting volume of contaminated air and drive the Acid Mist from each cell through a maze of ducts feeding a remote centralized equipment to clean it prior to discharge back to atmosphere. There are significant secondary problems derived from the high flows of Acid Mist driven through the maze of ducts: (1) the need for systematic, frequent cleaning and maintenance of the hoods, and specially ducts, so that they remain free of obstructions from CuS04 crystallization buildups at all times, in order not to decrease the effectiveness of the remote centralized contaminated air cleaning equipment; and (2) high corrosion of all equipment and Tankhouse installations. As already mentioned, the high energy consumption is a direct consequence of the present strategy of dilution of the contaminants, acid vapors and electrolyte droplets by a great volume of air infiltrated into each cell from the Tankhouse ambient; such contaminated gaseous volume must inevitably travel considerable distances to reach the cleaning installations outside the Tankhouse; therefore, a high energy requirement must be spent, This is the main technical problem the present invention resolves, with the added advantage that the solution proposed also resolves well and effectively all the secondary problems mentioned above. On the other hand, the present art systems of capture and confinement based on non-porous covers of the hood type, in addition to their high energy consumption, suffer from a very serious technical environmental shortcoming in that the covers require removal from each cell in order to harvest cathodes. In effect, upon uncovering the energized cells in operation, the accumulated confined volume of Acid Mist is discharged directly to the cell work environment until harvesting is finished, and furthermore, the exposed electrolyte continues emitting acid vapors and drops of electrolyte uncontrolled to the global environment of the Tankhouse. Due to the shortcoming mentioned while cells are being harvested, the maximum allowed concentration limits of hazardous substances in the work ambient in the vicinity far exceeds the corresponding Health and Work Safety Protocols and Regulations that protect industrial hygiene and occupational health of workers. To specifically resolve the technical environmental problem mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the same inventor has developed a preferred realization of a “system for individual capture and confinement of Acid Mist for each celf’, disclosed in Chilean Patent application № 1056-2013. In the mentioned patent application, a novel cell cover system is proposed with individual, impermeable, thermally insulated barriers that overcome the Acid Mist capture and confinement shortcomings and deficiencies of the devices used in the present art. The novel covers, at the same time, actually diminish the volume of Acid Mist generation in the electrowining process of non-ferrous metals by minimizing the volume for confinement inside the cell, while maintaining the Acid Mist in permanent and continuous confinement in the assigned space in each cell, as the barrier cover stays in place in the cell and is not required to be removed in order to harvest cathodes from the cell. The concept analysis and development of the novel preferred executions of the present invention are based on fundamental key environmental practices to solve the problem of Acid Mist control in an effective and efficient manner, which are based on elemental principles of sound and effective environmental and effluent problem management, as follows: 1. “Eliminate the generation of contaminated effluents in the process; and if this is not possible, maximize diminishment of contaminant generation” - as is the case of electrowining cell of non-ferrous metals that generates Acid Mist from acid electrolytes. 2. “Minimize the flows of contaminated effluents”, which diminishes the size and capacity of the equipment needed to clean effluents, because, on one hand smaller volumes are handled, and on the other, the concentration of contaminants in the flows is larger, facilitating removal. 3. “Remove the contents of contaminant from the effluent before discharging to the, ambient; and implement the removal as close as possible from the generation point”. 4. Catch the contaminants in a manner such that: • they can be recycled back to the original process • and/or, they have commercial value • or at last, they can be disposed in an environment friendly manner In compliance with these principles, the abatement, meaning the treatment of removal and catching of contaminants in the present invention, deviates radically from the present art, as it is done with a minimum dilution, that is to say , with minimum infiltration of air from the Tankhouse into each cell; and the abatement of contaminants is done as close as possible to the cell where they are generated, without a network of ducts, and the useful and valuable components in the Acid Mist , such as, water, sulfuric acid and electrolyte are substantially recuperated immediately in situ and recycled back immediately for reuse in the process. With respect to the magnitude of the volume of Acid Mist required to be confined in each cell, it is worth stressing, that: • Conceptually, the minimum theoretical extraction volume of Acid Mist per unit of time, or extraction flow, is equal to the volume Acid Mist generated by the cell in its operating conditions per unit of time, and this is precisely the key concept used in the present invention • It is essential to maintain a stable depression sustained in time to keep the Acid Mist generated by each cell permanently confined within its volume of confinement, and furthermore, and also indispensable - for reasons of ambient contamination in the work areas of the cell vicinity - to assure that such depression is maintained at all times stable in the confinement volume, especially when cathodes are removed from each cell during harvesting periods. According to our experience, the cover described in the above mentioned Chilean Patent Application, that is a non porous, impermeable and thermally insulated cell cover, equipped with flexible seals allow an ambient air infiltration flow ranging from 10% to 100% with respect to the flow of gasses generated by the process in each cell; this in effect, represents a maximum outside air infiltration of one time the flow of gasses and vapors actually generated in each cell by its own operation, and such total gaseous flow turns out sufficient not only for effective extraction of the Acid Mist from each cell without causing any contaminant emission to the work ambient area, but also results in a modest flow, allowing efficient operation of the System for Recuperation/Recycling proposed in the present invention for substantial removal of contaminants from the Acid Mist at each cell or in its proximity in an effective manner and with very low energy consumption. Consequently, the solution this invention proposes contrasts radically with the industrial solutions actually used at present, which is sized to handle, in some cases, more than 10 times the flow of gasses and vapors actually generated bv the normal operation of the cell, which as has been said, is the principal responsible for the present unnecessary and very high levels of energy consumption.

Proceed to the individual regulation of the extraction flow from each cell according to the preestablished setting value according to the operating conditions of each cell using the System of Measurement, Control and Regulation of individual cell extraction 12. EXAMPLE AND RESULTS An industrial prototype of the System for Recovery/Recycling Acid Mist (SIRENA) was built and installed for continuous operation to recover and recycle the Acid Mist generated by four copper electrowinning cells of 32 cathodes and 33 insoluble lead anodes (reference Fig. 1) in normal industrial operation, with sulfuric acid electrolyte of average H2S04 180 gram per liter and average temperature 45° C, operating with current density between 280 and 300 Am2, at an altitude of approximately 500 m above sea level. Power consumption and contents of sulfuric acid entrained in discharge flow of Acid Mist extracted from the cells and treated by the prototype SIRENA System, Figure 1, were measured at the point of entry of the extraction turbine, before discharging the cleaned Acid Mist into ambient atmosphere. Four individual First Devices, 3, were installed in the SIRENA System, one in each cell, of dimensions: height 310 mm, width 240 mm and length 310 mm, with a 15 χ 15 cm, glass visor, and liquid overflow height of 10 cm above the level of the diffuser system, comprised of 8 Acid Mist bubbler diffuser lines, with a total perforated area of 14 cm2. A Second Multi-Chamber Condenser Device, 7, was installed, of dimensions: height 100 cm, width 30 cm and length 30 cm, comprising four Chambers with glass visors of 20 χ 20 cm in Chambers 1, 2 and 3; Chamber 1 was supplied with a bubbler system, formed by three perforated tubes of 4 cm in diameter, with a total perforated area of 26 cm2, and with an overflow hole for condensate located 10 cm above the level of bubbler System. Chamber 2 was equipped with cooler tubes chilled by ambient air circulation . Chamber 3 was filled with dry inert aggregate particles of diameters between 6 and 11 mm, and Chamber 4 was left empty. Extraction flow of generated Acid Mist in each cell was regulated in a range between 180 and 220 liters per minute, which also guaranteed continuous sustained depression of 0, 01mbar in the confinement volume of each cell, that in turn assured null escape of Acid Mist to the working environment.. RESULTS OBTAINED • Using the impermeable covers with flexible seals disclosed in Chilean Patent Application №1056-2013, the operating cells continuously infiltrated ambient air- in a range between 50% and 85% of the volume of gases and vapors in the Acid Mist generated by each cell - without observing any trace of emission of Acid Mist to the working environment at any time during the duration of the test, including the periods of cathode harvests. This result confirmed and validated the hypothesis that a modest volume of air infiltration from ambient - between 10% and 100% - of the gas and vapors in the Acid Mist generated in each operating cell, is effective not only to extract the Acid Mist from the cells but also sufficient to prevent any emission of hazardous gases from the cells to the working environment. • The power consumption of the extraction turbine used to aspirate the entire SIRENA System, was measured with a single phase electric meter, and indicated a total consumption of 74.4 KWH for 286.3 hours of continuous testing measurement of the System for Recovery/Recycling Acid Mist (SIRENA), which includes the power consumption of the extraction turbine used. This result is equivalent to a required power of 260 W for the global functioning of the SIRENA System, namely, for the extraction from the four electrolytic cells of 32 cathodes each operating continuously and the entire treatment and recycling of the Acid Mist generated, i.e. an electric power consumption of 65 W/cell. with the cells operating at 285 and 300 A/m2 (including 30 liters per minute of air for electrolyte aeration in one cell). Chemical measurements of H2S04 content taken at the discharge flow of the System for Recovery/Recycling Acid Mist (SIRENA) to the extraction turbine indicated a stable maximum concentration 0.55 mg/Nm3 of sulfuric acid, sustained over time. This level of contaminant purification efficiency in treated Acid Mist by SIRENA System comfortably meets the current Chilean legislation emission limit of 0.8 mg/Nm3 of H2SO4 to the atmosphere. To confirm the above, measurements of Acid Mist pressure drop in the flow through the SIRENA System prototype were also made, which showed 1100 mm H20 column; which for a global aspiration flow of 810 liter per minute for the 4 cells connected corresponds to a total power requirement of 140 W. The difference of 124 W with respect to the 264 W total determined by direct electrical measurement of power consumption corresponds to the power with which the gases discharge from the extraction turbine, a surplus of power that was available to drive the discharge of gases through an additional chemical filter system, to ensure capability to meet even lower limits of contaminants, below 0.55 mg/Nm3’, when and if required. Condensates collected from drops of electrolyte and sulfuric acid and water vapors generated by each cell, collected in the four First Devices, 3 and the Second Multi-Chamber Condenser Device, 7, were also measured, showing a daily average of 3.3 ± 1 liters per cell during the test (conducted in spring/summer). In the course of the test, NO CuS04 crystallization buildups, obstructions or corrosion of any element or component of the prototype SIRENA System were observed, including its Systems of Measurement, Control and Regulation of Flows, nor in the extraction turbine.
