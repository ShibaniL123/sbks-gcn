CARD EDGE CONNECTOR FOR AN IMAGING SENSOR BACKGROUND [0001] The disclosure relates generally to card edge connectors and more specifically, but not entirely, to card edge connectors for sensors, such as an image sensor. Advances in technology have provided advances in imaging capabilities for medical use. One area that has enjoyed some of the most beneficial advances is that of endoscopic surgical procedures because of the advances in the components that make up an endoscope. [0002] Conventional, digital video systems used for laparoscopy, arthroscopy, ENT, gynecology and urology are based upon conventional, rigid endoscopes, which are optically and mechanically coupled to a separate hand-piece unit, which contains one or more image sensor(s). Image information is optically transmitted along the length of the endoscope, after which it is focused upon the sensor via an optical coupler. [0003] However, due to advances in technology sensors are now being located in the distal end or distal tip of medical or other type of scopes. With such advancements come difficulties and problems associated with mechanically and electrically connecting the sensor to a printed circuit board (PCB) in such scopes. Accordingly, devices, systems and methods for connecting sensors to PCBs in the distal end or tip of a scope are needed. As will be seen, the disclosure provides such devices, systems and methods for connecting sensors to PCBs in the distal end or tip of a scope in an effective and elegant manner. [0004] The features and advantages of the disclosure will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by the practice of the disclosure without undue experimentation. The features and advantages of the disclosure may be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

[0030] It will be appreciated that any of the above-identified configurations for an endoscopic system shown in FIGS. 1A-1G, any combination of the above elements in a different configuration, and any other configuration used for Minimally Invasive Surgery, are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure. [0031] In an implementation of the system 100 for providing an image in a light deficient environment, the system may comprise a surgical scope, which itself may comprise a tubular member having a proximal portion and a distal portion. The system 100 may further comprise a light source, a camera control unit (CCU), and a display. As described more fully herein below, the surgical scope may comprise a connector assembly that may be located at the distal portion of the tubular member and may have a first end, a second end, and a plurality of electrical connectors. The connector assembly may also receive therein a printed circuit board and an image sensor. In such an implementation, the image sensor may be connected to the connector assembly at the first end of and the printed circuit board may be connected to the connector assembly at the second end, such that the connector assembly attaches the image sensor at the distal portion of the tubular member and electrically connects the image sensor to the printed circuit board via the plurality of electrical connectors, thereby providing electrical communication between the image sensor and the printed circuit board. [0032] Referring now to FIGS. 2A-2D, an endoscopic device 200 is illustrated. The endoscopic device 200 may comprise a tubular member, such as an outer scope tube 202, a lens assembly 204, a connector or card edge connector 206, an image sensor 208, a card edge PCBA 210, and a plurality of wires and/or a wire harness and/or other communication components 212. It will be appreciated that the connector 206 may sometimes be referred to herein as a connector assembly 206 because a connector may comprise subcomponents that when assembled form a complete connector. [0033] The endoscopic device is illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2D with the imaging sensor 208 located at a distal portion 203, or at a tip, of the outer scope tube 202. It will be appreciated that the endoscopic device 200 may comprise: an outer scope tube 202, a lens assembly 204 complete with various optical elements that may be used in conventional endoscopic devices, which are not shown for purposes of clarity, a card edge connector 206 for housing or securing an image sensor 208 at a first end, which may be a distal end or distal portion 206a of the connector 206 as illustrated, connecting to a card edge PCBA 210 at a second or proximal end 206b, and wires and/or a wire harness and/or other communication components 212 to convey a signal from the card edge PCBA 210 to the image processor (not illustrated), which may be located remotely with respect to the image sensor, for example, in the handpiece of an imaging device or camera, or in the camera control unit (CCU), or further up the length of a lumen. [0034] The image sensor 208 may include an image sensor silicon die, a pixel array 209, and a plurality of sensor pads for electrically communicating with corresponding electrical connectors, such as pins or pads. The image sensor 208 may include a plurality of bonds 221, such as wire bonds, which connect the plurality of sensor pads 220 to a corresponding plurality of electrical connectors 222, such as pins or pads, which may be part of the connector 206. [0035] It will be appreciated that the card edge connector 206 may be used as a package to house the sensor 208. Additionally, it should be understood that structures of the card edge connector 206 may aid in the manufacture and transport of the sensor as part of sensor packaging. One purpose for the card edge connector or package 206 is to simplify the process of connecting the imaging sensor 208 to the wiring harness 212. The card edge connector or package 206 may facilitate sensor connection to a wiring harness 212. [0036] It will be appreciated that FIGS. 2A-2D illustrate the PCBA 210 being connected to the connector assembly 206 at the second end 206b of the connector assembly 206. Conversely, the image sensor 208 is illustrated as being connected to the connector assembly 206 at the first end 206a, such that the connector assembly 206 attaches the image sensor 208 at the distal portion 203 of the tubular member 202 and electrically connects the image sensor 208 to the PCBA 210 via the plurality of electrical connectors 222, thereby providing electrical communication between the image sensor 208 and the PCBA 210. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the connector assembly 206 may be used in conjunction with any elongated configuration in addition to a generally tubular configuration and such elongated configurations are intended to fall within the scope of this disclosure. [0037] The connector assembly 206 may operate to attach the image sensor 208 within the distal portion 203 of the tubular member 202 in a vertical and substantially perpendicular orientation (as illustrated best in FIG. 2D) with respect to the PCBA 210. In an implementation, the PCBA 210 may be attached perpendicularly out of the center of and with respect to the image sensor 208. In an implementation, the PCBA 210 may be attached perpendicularly off of an edge of and with respect to the image sensor 208. As illustrated, the image sensor 208 may be located substantially beneath a plane (illustrated by dashed line P in FIG. 2D) of the electrical connectors 222 at the first end 206a of the connector assembly 206, such that the plane of the electrical connectors 222 at the first end 206a of the connector assembly 206 is located substantially above the image sensor 208. In this configuration, the pixel array 209 of the image sensor 208 is located beneath the plane (illustrated by dashed line P in FIG. 2D) of the electrical connectors 222 at the first end 206a of the connector assembly 206. [0038] Referring now to FIGS. 3A-3D, the figures illustrate a front, side cross-sectional, rear, and bottom cross-sectional views, respectively, of the card edge connector device 206 in accordance with the principles and teachings of the disclosure. The card edge connector 206 of FIGS. 3A-3D is illustrated without the scope or endoscopic device, including the outer scope tube 202, for purposes of clarity and simplicity in discussing the details of the connector 206. [0039] It will be appreciated that the card edge connector 206 may be configured, dimensioned and built to help minimize the overall size of the package, for example, in the x-dimension (width) and the y-dimension (height). Accordingly, one end 206a of the connector 206, which may be a first end or at the distal end or distal portion, may be optimized for placement of the sensor 208 in order to protect the wire-bonds that may connect the sensor 208 to the plurality of electrical connectors 222, such as pins or pads, of the connector 206, and to provide overall protection of the sensor 208. [0040] To facilitate the above, the card edge connector 206 may comprise a cavity or recess 230 for receiving therein the sensor 208 and silicon die. The other end 206b, which may be a second end or a proximal end, of the connector 206 may be optimized to accept the edge card PCBA 210 (illustrated best in FIGS. 2B and 2D). At this end 206b, a first slot, socket or receptacle 232 (as illustrated best in FIGS. 3B-3D) may be provided to accept or receive therein the edge card PCBA 210. It will be appreciated that the PCBA 210 may be held in the first slot, socket or receptacle 232 via a bias force. The plurality of electrical connectors 222 may extend into the first slot, socket or receptacle 232, such that when the PCBA 210 is located within the first slot 232 the electrical connectors 222 of the connector assembly 206 may be in electrical communication with corresponding electrical connectors on the PCBA 210. The connector 206 may further comprise a vertical slot or channel 250 for receiving fiber optic cable strands therein. [0041] FIGS. 4A-4C illustrate a front, side cross-sectional, and bottom cross-sectional views, respectively, of the card edge connector device 206 with a sensor 208 loaded therein in accordance with the principles and teachings of the disclosure. It will be appreciated that the sensor 208 may be loaded in the cavity 230 as discussed above in connection with FIGS. 3A-3D. It will be appreciated that the imaging sensor 208 and silicon die may be attached or otherwise connected to the connector 206 using any mechanical mechanism and/or an adhesive or other bond. For example, the imaging sensor 208 may comprise a plurality of sensor pads or electrical connectors 220 that may be bonded or otherwise connected to the electrical connectors 222 of the card edge connector 206 with a plurality of bonds 221, such as wire bonds. [0042] In the configuration illustrated in FIGS. 4A-4C, the pixel array 209 of the image sensor 208 is located on the same plane or substantially the same plane (illustrated by dashed line P in FIG. 4C) as the electrical connectors 222 at the first end 206a of the connector assembly 206. [0043] In an implementation of the disclosure illustrated best in FIGS. 7A-7C, adhesive may be used to attach the sensor 208 to the connector 206. The adhesive may be electrically conductive adhesive, and may be, for example, gold or silver filled adhesive or other metallic filled adhesive. The adhesive may be placed in controlled locations of the connector 206 to electrically connect the silicon die to a specific pin of the connector 206, such as the ground pin. As illustrated best in FIG. 7C, the controlled location may be an individual cavity or other receptacle 224 to receive the electrically conductive adhesive therein. As illustrated in 7C, a ground pin 222a is shown as being electrically connected to the sensor pad 220 by a wire bond 221 to the ground pin 222a. In other words, the ground pin 222a may be electrically connected to the silicon die of the sensor by an electrically conductive adhesive to provide an improved electrical ground path for the sensor. As illustrated, the wire bond 221 may be run on the outside of the sensor to the one or more electrical connectors 222, such as pins. It will be appreciated that the attachment of the electrically conductive adhesive to the ground pin 222a may reduce the amount of noise in the sensor 208 and may increase signal integrity as compared to a sensor attached to a ground pin without any epoxy or electrically conductive adhesive. [0044] FIGS. 5A-5C illustrate front, side cross-sectional, and bottom cross-sectional views, respectively, of the card edge connector device 206 with a sensor 208 loaded therein with wire bonds 221 connecting the sensor 208 to electrical connectors 222, such as pins or pads, of the connector 206 in accordance with the principles and teachings of the disclosure. As illustrated best in FIG. 5B, the connector 206 may comprise the cavity 230 that may be defined by a sidewall 209. In various implementations, the sidewall 209 may comprise a height, such that the sidewall 209 extends above and beyond the sensor 208. In various implementations, the connector assembly 206 may comprise the cavity 230 or a partial cavity that may comprise a sidewall 209 and that is located at the first end 206a of the connector 206. It will be appreciated that the image sensor 208 may be located within the cavity 230 or partial cavity, such that the sidewall 209 surrounds at least a portion of the image sensor 208, thereby protecting the image sensor 208 and electrical connectors 221, 222 from damage. In an implementation, the image sensor 208 may be completely surrounded by the sidewall 209. In an implementation, the image sensor 208 may be partially surrounded by the sidewall 209. In an implementation, the image sensor 208 may not be surrounded by the sidewall 209, but may instead sit proud of and with respect to the connector 206. [0045] In the configuration illustrated in FIGS. 5A-5C, the pixel array 209 of the image sensor 208 is located on the same plane or substantially the same plane (illustrated by dashed line P in FIG. 5C) as the electrical connectors 222 at the first end 206a of the connector assembly 206. [0046] FIGS. 6A-6C illustrate a front, three-dimensional view of the card edge connector device 206, a rear, three-dimensional view of the card edge connector device 206, and a front, three-dimensional view of the card edge connector device 206 with a sensor 208 loaded therein, respectively, in accordance with the principles and teachings of the disclosure. The three images illustrated in FIGS. 6A-6C, illustrate the concept disclosed herein for the card edge connector 206. In an implementation, the housing of the connector 206 may comprise 3.5mm housing outer diameter. In an implementation, the connector 206 may comprise six contacts or electrical connectors 222. In an implementation, the connector 206 may comprise a fine pitch (e.g., about 0.5mm to about 0.6mm). In an implementation, the connector 206 may comprise a first end or distal end 206a comprising the cavity or recess 230 to hold and receive the sensor die therein. In an implementation, the connector 206 may comprise a second end or proximal end 206b comprising a socket or receptacle 232 to accept or receive a micro edge card or PCBA therein. In an implementation, the PCBA may comprise a rigid PCB and features to connect a wire harness as is known in the art. In an implementation, the PCBA may comprise a flat flexible PCB. [0047] FIGS. 7A-7C illustrate front, side cross-sectional and bottom cross-sectional views, respectively, of a card edge connector device 206 with a sensor 208 loaded proud of a plane of the connector in accordance with the principles and teachings of the disclosure. The figures illustrate an implementation in which the sensor 208 may sit proud above the plane (represented by dashed line P) of the electrical connectors 222, such as pins or pads, at the first end 206a of the connector assembly 206 as illustrated best in FIG. 7C. In this configuration, the pixel array 209 of the image sensor 208 is located above a plane (represented by dashed line P) of the electrical connectors 222 at the first end 206a of the connector assembly 206. This configuration may allow the electrical connectors 222, such as pins or pads, of the connector assembly 206 to sit under the sensor 208 rather than being positioned on either side of the sensor 208 as in other implementations disclosed herein. This configuration may enable a smaller overall housing diameter and an overall smaller housing package or assembly for use with tubular members having small diameters, such as an endoscope having a diameter of 5mm or less. [0048] In an implementation of the disclosure illustrated best in FIGS. 7A-7C, adhesive may be placed in controlled locations of the connector 206 to electrically connect the silicon die of the image sensor 208 to a specific pin of the connector 206, such as the ground pin. As illustrated best in FIG. 7C, the controlled location may be an individual cavity or other receptacle 224 to receive the electrically conductive adhesive therein. As illustrated in 7C, a ground pin 222a is shown as being electrically connected to the sensor pad 220 by a wire bond 221 to the ground pin 222a. In other words, the ground pin 222a may be electrically connected to the silicon die of the sensor by an electrically conductive adhesive to provide an improved electrical ground path for the sensor. As illustrated, the wire bond 221 may be run on the outside of the sensor to the one or more electrical connectors 222, such as pins. This configuration allows for an overall smaller housing for use with tubular members having small diameters, such as an endoscope having a diameter of 5mm or less. It will be appreciated that the attachment of the electrically conductive adhesive to the ground pin 222a may reduce the amount of noise in the sensor 208 and may increase signal integrity as compared to a sensor attached to a ground pin without any epoxy or electrically conductive adhesive. [0049] FIGS. 8A-8B illustrate perspective views of a card edge connector device 206 for use with a backside illuminated sensor 208 loaded proud of a plane P of the connector 206 in accordance with the principles and teachings of the disclosure. In this implementation, the pixel array 209 of the image sensor 208 is located above a plane of the electrical connectors 222 at the first end 206a of the connector assembly 206. The figures illustrate an implementation in which the sensor 208 is constructed using a backside illumination (BSI) manufacturing process resulting in the sensor pads 220 being located on the opposite side of the silicon die as the pixel array 209. As shown, this BSI sensor may be used with the card edge connector 206 disclosed herein. The pads 220 of BSI sensor 208 may be bonded directly to the electrical connectors 222, such as pins or pads, of the card edge connector 206 without the need for wire bonds. Referring specifically to FIG. 8A, pad 220b may be bonded directly to the electrical connector 222b without the need for wire bonds. Such direct bonding may occur with respect to all sensor pads 220 and all electrical connectors 222. It will be appreciated that the pads 220 that may be located on the underside of the sensor 208 may be soldered onto the electrical connectors 222 of the connector assembly 206. [0050] FIGS. 9A-9C illustrate front, side cross-sectional and bottom cross-sectional views, respectively, of a card edge connector device 206 with a sensor 208 loaded proud of a plane (represented by dashed line P) at the first end 206a of the connector assembly 206 in accordance with the principles and teachings of the disclosure. In this implementation, the pixel array 209 of the image sensor 208 is located above a plane (represented by dashed line P) of the electrical connectors 222 at the first end 206a of the connector assembly 206. [0051] The figures illustrate an implementation in which the sensor 208 is constructed using a backside illumination (BSI) manufacturing process resulting in the sensor pads 220 being located on the opposite side of the silicon die as the pixel array 209. As can be seen in FIGS. 9A-9C, which implement the details of FIGS. 8A-8B, this configuration may allow the card edge connector 206 diameter to shrink with respect to the size of the sensor 208 resulting in a more efficient use of the limited space available in a tubular member having a sensor located distally therein, while still retaining the benefits of the connector assembly 206. This efficiency gain can be used to put a larger sensor in a specific scope diameter, or to shrink the scope diameter around a specific sensor size, either of which may result in improved clinical efficiency. [0052] It will be appreciated that the disclosure illustrates in FIGS. 1A-6C and describes herein novel devices, systems and methods for packaging a silicon imaging sensor die that: (1) protects the sensor 208 and wire bonds 221 from damage; and/or (2) minimizes the footprint of the final card edge connector 206 assembly; and/or (3) enables simple mechanical connection to a PCBA with an attached wire harness that carries data to a remote or off-site image processing hardware. The above characteristics may be important for applications in which space is minimal, such as in an endoscopic application with the image sensor located distally within a tip of the scope or any other application in which physical space is limited. [0053] FIGS. 10A and 10B illustrate a top view and a cross-sectional view, respectively, of a conventional, prior art packaged imaging sensor device. It will be appreciated that the connector 206 of the disclosure provides significant advantages over a conventional package for an image sensor. A common method of packaging silicon die comprising an imaging sensor is illustrated. It will be appreciated that the ceramic package has a glass lid to protect the die and the wire bonds as illustrated. Conventional packages are optimized to keep height of the image sensor to a minimum, but the footprint of the image sensor is very large in comparison to the footprint of the image sensor disclosed herein. Due to the mechanical constraints of being located within a tip or distal end of an endoscope or other application where space is constrained, a large footprint is unworkable or undesirable. Conventional packages for an image sensor are optimized for a surface-mount solder process to attach the PCBA, which has local image processing hardware and circuitry (e.g., image processing hardware and circuitry on the same PCBA as the image sensor), but such a configuration may be difficult to connect to a wire harness. [0054] It will be appreciated that the teachings and principles of the disclosure may be used in a reusable device platform, a limited use device platform, a re-posable use device platform, or a single-use/disposable device platform without departing from the scope of the disclosure. It will be appreciated that in a re-usable device platform an end-user is responsible for cleaning and sterilization of the device. In a limited use device platform the device can be used for some specified amount of times before becoming inoperable. Typical new device is delivered sterile with additional uses requiring the end-user to clean and sterilize before additional uses. In a re-posable use device platform a third-party may reprocess the device (e.g., cleans, packages and sterilizes) a single-use device for additional uses at a lower cost than a new unit.
