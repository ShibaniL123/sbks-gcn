Reference Example C-13: Synthesis of [6-[5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridyl]pyrimidin-4-yl]methylamine hydrochloride (C-13)
(step 1) Synthesis of 6-methyl-2-[5-trifluoromethyl]-2-pyridyl-1,3, 6,2-dioxaazaborocane-4, 8-dione
To 2-bromo-5-trifluoromethylpyridine (7.79 g, 34.4 mmol) and triisopropyl borate (9.6 mL, 40 mmol) was added tetrahydrofuran (100 mL), and the mixture was cooled to -78°C and 2.5 mol/L n-butyllithium (hexane solution, 13.8 mL, 34.4 mmol) was added dropwise. After stirring at -78°C for 1 hr, the mixture was heated to 23°C and further stirred for 3 hr. A solution of N-methyliminodiacetic acid (8.61 g, 58.5 mmol) in dimethyl sulfoxide (68 mL) was separately prepared, placed in a three-necked flask connected to a dropping funnel and a distillation apparatus, and heated to an inside temperature of 115°C. The above reaction mixture was transferred to the dropping funnel and added dropwise over about 1 hr while controlling the addition rate such that the inside temperature was 110 - 120°C. During this time, tetrahydrofuran was rapidly evaporated. After completion of the dropwise addition, the temperature was decreased to 50°C, dimethyl sulfoxide was evaporated under reduced pressure (250 mTorr). The residue was washed with diethyl ether and the obtained solid was dried under reduced pressure to give the title compound (3.43 g, 11.4 mmol, 33%).
