Step 2: To a solution of 2,4-difluoroaniline (0.082 g, 0.64 mmol) and N-ethyl-N-isopropylpropan-2-amine (0.17 g, 1.34 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane(1 mL) was added a solution of the freshly prepared acid chloride, 2,6-dichloro-3-nitrobenzoyl chloride (0.162 g, 0.64 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (1 mL) dropwise at 0° C. The resulting light-orange solution was warmed to 50° C. and stirred for 8 hours. The reaction mixture was adsorbed to Celite® and purified by automated flash chromatography using a gradient of 0-60% ethyl acetate in hexanes as eluent to give the title compound as a tan solid (0.171 g, 75%): mp 199-202° C.;
