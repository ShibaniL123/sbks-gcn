BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and the third most common cause of cancer related death worldwide. Patients chronically infected with hepatitis B or C are at high risk for development of HCC, but alcohol abuses and metabolic disorders can also lead to HCC development. Less than 40% of patients fulfil the criteria for curative treatment like tumour resection or liver transplantation. Furthermore, the risk of tumour recurrence is high. Patients with advanced HCC can only undergo palliative treatment such as local ablation or the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. Nevertheless these treatments result in a marginal beneficial effect on the expected lifetime of patients. As a result, the prognosis of HCC remains poor and new therapies are urgently needed. WO 2012/070468 A1 discloses a glypican-3 (GPC3) specific antibody and a human chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) able to target GPC3. WO 2012/070468 A1 further discloses compositions and methods for diagnosing and treating diseases associated with dysregulated expression of GPC3, such as liver cancer, using said antibodies. There is a need in the art for improved means and methods for detecting, diagnosing, prognosing, preventing and/or treating liver cancer, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), such as via specific T cells or by immunotherapy or peptide-based vaccines.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION Before the present invention is described in more detail below, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular methodology, protocols and reagents described herein as these may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention which will be limited only by the appended claims. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. For the purpose of the present invention, all references cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entireties. Concentrations, amounts, and other numerical data may be expressed or presented herein in a range format. It is to be understood that such a range format is used merely for convenience and brevity and thus should be interpreted flexibly to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. As an illustration, a numerical range of "5 to 50 amino acids" should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited values of 5 to 50, but also include individual values and sub-ranges within the indicated range. Thus, included in this numerical range are individual values such as 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,... 48, 49, 50 and sub-ranges such as from 9 to 50, from5 to 25, from 9 to 25, from 10 to 25, from 10 to 20 and from 15 to 25, etc. This same principle applies to ranges reciting only one numerical value, such as "at least 8 amino acids". Furthermore, such an interpretation should apply regardless of the breadth of the range or the characteristics being described. GPC3-specific T-cell receptors As discussed above, the present invention provides GPC3-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs). A majority of T cells have a T cell receptor (TCR) existing as a complex of several proteins. The actual T cell receptor is composed of two (separate) peptide chains, which are produced from the independent T cell receptor alpha and beta (TCR α and TCR β) genes and are called α- and β-TCR chains. γδ T cells (gamma delta T cells) represent a small subset of T cells that possess a distinct T cell receptor (TCR) on their surface. However, in γδ T cells, the TCR is made up of one γ-chain and one δ-chain. This group of T cells is much less common (2% of total T cells) than the αβ T cells. The structure of the T cell receptor is very similar to immunoglobulin Fab fragments, which are regions defined as the combined light and heavy chain of an antibody arm. Each chain of the TCR is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and possesses one N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig)-variable (V) domain, one Ig-constant (C) domain, a transmembrane/cell membrane-spanning region, and a short cytoplasmic tail at the C-terminal end. According to the invention, the term "variable region of a T cell receptor" relates to the variable domains of the TCR chains. The variable domain of both the TCR α-chain and β-chain have three hypervariable or complementarity determining regions (CDRs), whereas the variable region of the β-chain has an additional area of hypervariability (HV4) that does not normally contact antigen and therefore is not considered a CDR. The first signal in activation of T cells is provided by binding of the T cell receptor to a short peptide presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on another cell. This ensures that only a T cell with a TCR specific to that peptide is activated. HCC expresses like many other tumours tumour-associated antigens. Glypican-3 (GPC3) and alpha-fetoprotein are not expressed in healthy human liver but reactivated in up to 70% and 80% of all HCCs, respectively. - TCR specific for GPC3 peptide 367 The inventors have now identified immunodominant GPC3 epitopes, namely the HLA-A2 bound GPC3 peptide 367, and cloned a TCR that is specific for GPC3 peptide 367.

Bi-specific antibodies, As discussed above, the present invention provides bi-specific antibodies comprising (a) the T-cell receptor α- and β-chain(s) of the TCR defined herein, which are linked with each other and fused, preferably via a linker, to(b) an antibody or a single chain antibody fragment (scFv) which is directed against an antigen or epitope on the surface of lymphocytes. In one embodiment, the antibody or scFv is/are directed against the CD3 or CD5 receptor of T cells. In this embodiment, the bi-specific antibody will bind to T cells and redirect them to GPC3-presenting tumor cells. In another embodiment, the antibody or scFv is/are directed against the co-stimulatory CD28 receptor on T cells. In this embodiment, the bi-specific antibody will bind to and co-activate T cells and direct them to GPC3-presenting tumor cells. In another embodiment, antibodies or scFV against CD3 or CD5 and CD28 are combined in tetravalent antibody constructs. In one embodiment, the antibody or scFv is/are directed against the CD56 receptor of NK cells. In this embodiment, the bi-specific antibody will bind to NK cells and redirect them to GPC3-presenting tumor cells. In another embodiment, the antibody or scFv is/are directed against the activating receptor CD 16 on NK cells. In this embodiment, the bi-specific antibody will bind to and activate NK cells and direct them to GPC3-presenting tumor cells. In another embodiment, antibodies or scFV against CD56 and CD16 are combined in tetravalent antibody constructs. For example, a bi-specific antibody can be a bi-specific T-cell engager (BiTE) which is a class of artificial bispecific monoclonal antibodies that are investigated for the use as anticancer drugs. They direct a host's immune system, more specifically the T cells' cytotoxic activity, against cancer cells. BiTE is a registered trademark of Micromet AG.[BiTEs are fusion proteins consisting of two single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) of different antibodies, or amino acid sequences from four different genes, on a single peptide chain of about 55 kilodaltons. One of the scFvs binds to T cells such as via the CD3 receptor or to CD56 for NK cell activation, and the other to a tumor cell via a tumor specific molecule (see e.g. Csoka et al., 1996). Preferably, the bi-specific antibodies of the present invention are used as recombinant proteins. Such recombinant proteins are expressed, preferably in E.coli or mammalian cells, and then purified before further use or application. The present invention provides the expressed and purified bi-specific antibodies.

Preferably, the nucleic acid sequences of the present invention are codon-optimized for expression in mammalian cells, preferably for expression in human cells. For generation of bi-specific antibodies the nucleic acid sequences can also be codon-optimized for expression in bacteria, yeast or insect cells. Codon-optimization refers to the exchange in a sequence of interest of codons that are generally rare in highly expressed genes of a given species by codons that are generally frequent in highly expressed genes of such species, such codons encoding the same amino acids as the codons that are being exchanged. Within the scope of this invention are also the nucleotide sequences obtained due to the degeneration of the genetic code of the above nucleotide sequences. As discussed above, the present invention provides an expression construct for expressing the T-cell receptor according to the present invention in a cell. As discussed above, the present invention provides an expression construct for expressing the soluble T-cell receptor construct according to the present invention in a cell.

As discussed above, the present invention provides an expression construct for expressing the bi-specific antibody according to the present invention as well as the expressed and purified bi-specific antibody. Preferably, the expression constructs further comprise promoter and terminator sequences. An "expression or gene construct" (wherein both terms are used interchangeably throughout this specification) refers to a nucleic acid construct, usually an expression vector or plasmid that is used to introduce a specific gene sequence into a target cell. Once the expression or gene construct is inside the cell, the protein that is encoded by the gene is produced by the cellular transcription and translation machinery. The expression or gene construct is designed to contain respective regulatory sequences that act as enhancer and promoter regions and lead to efficient transcription of the gene carried on the construct, including promoter and terminator sequences. The goal of a well-designed expression or gene construct is the production of large amounts of stable mRNA, and therefore proteins. Alternatively, an RNA is synthesized or in vitro transcribed and introduced directly into the cells for protein expression. The skilled artisan can select further suitable components of expression or gene constructs. Examples for suitable expression constructs are viral vectors, such as retroviral vectors (as described in Verra et al, 2004; Porter et al, 2011), such as MP71 vectors (as described in Engels et al., 2003), or retroviral SIN vectors (as described in Yu et al., 1986); andlentiviral vectors (as described in Josef et al, 2008) or lentiviral SIN vectors, as described in Miyoshi et al., 1998. Viral vectors containing TCR-encoding genes can infect lymphocytes and express functional TCR in infected lymphocytes. Preferred is a SIN vector construct. Another example for a suitable expression construct is the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon transposase DNA plasmid system, SB DNA plasmid (as described in Maiti et al., 2013). The nucleic acids and/or in particular expression constructs of the invention can also be transferred into cells by transient RNA transfection. The nucleic acids and/or in particular expression constructs of the invention are capable of directing the synthesis/expression of the TCRs of the invention in a suitable host cell.

Adoptive transfer of such engineered T cells into hosts represents a promising approach for the immunotherapy of liver cancer, in particular HCC, or other cancers expressing GPC3. The application of GPC3-specific bi-specific antibodies or soluble T-cell receptors represents an alternative promising means and method to target GPC3-positive tumor cells by redirected T cells or by the soluble T-cell receptor construct.

Adoptive transfer of such engineered T cells into hosts represents a promising approach for the immunotherapy of liver cancer, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or other cancers expressing GPC3. A new therapeutic approach is the adoptive T cell therapy of HCC. The transferred T cells can recognize tumour antigen and thereby specifically eliminate tumour cells.

In one embodiment, said method comprises the steps of (a) providing one or more of (i) a T-cell receptor of the present invention or a soluble T-cell receptor construct or a chimeric T-cell receptor of the present invention or a bi-specific antibody of the present invention,(ii) a nucleic acid of the present invention,(iii) an expression construct of the present invention,(iv) a cell of the present invention, and(v) a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention;(b) direct application, preferably via injection or infusion, of one or more of (i) to (v) of step (a) to a subject or patient in need thereof,(c) optional, combining step (b) with radiation, checkpoint inhibitor or cancer chemotherapy. In this embodiment, preferably the bi-specific antibodies or the soluble TCR constructs of the present invention are utilized. Preferably, the bi-specific antibodies or the soluble TCR constructs of the present invention are used as recombinant proteins. In this embodiment, in step (b) the one or more of (i) to (v) of step (a) are used as recombinant proteins. The recombinant proteins, preferably the bi-specific antibodies or the soluble TCR constructs of the present invention, are expressed, preferably in E.coli or mammalian cells, and then purified before the application. T cells express inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), especially after long term exposure to the antigen. The ligands of CTLA-4 and PD-1, B7 and PD-L1 respectively, as well as the ligand of TIM-3, Galectin 9, are frequently expressed on tumor tissue and are involved in induction of T cell tolerance and thus are called immune checkpoints. To avoid silencing of transferred GPC3 specific T cells checkpoint inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors, exemplified by but not restricted to anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-L1 or anti-PD-1 antibodies, can be used to avoid inhibition of T cells within the tumor microenvironment (described in Hamid et al.

The lymphocytes provided in step (a) can be obtained from the subject or patient, such as from the blood or by lymphapheresis of allogeneic blood donors. Preferably, the ex vivo introduction in step (c) is carried out via electroporation of a nucleic acid of the present invention or of an expression construct of the present invention, or by transfection reagents, such as liposomes, or by transient RNA transfection. The expression construct is preferably, as described above, a viral construct, preferably a lentiviral vector, retroviral vector, or other state of the art viral vector. Examples for suitable expression constructs are viral vectors, such as retroviral vectors (as described in Verra et al, 2004; Porter et al, 2011), such as MP71 vectors (as described in Engels et al., 2003), or retroviral SIN vectors (as described in Yu et al., 1986); andlentiviral vectors (as described in Josef et al, 2008) or lentiviral SIN vectors, as described in Miyoshi et al., 1998. Another example for a suitable expression construct is the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon transposase DNA plasmid system, SB DNA plasmid (as described in Maiti et al., 2013). As discussed above, the present invention provides a method of detecting, diagnosing, prognosing, preventing and/or treating liver cancer, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or other cancers expressing GPC3. Said method comprises the detection and/or destruction of liver cancer cells, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells or of cancer cells of other cancers expressing GPC3, of a patient with the use of the soluble T-cell receptor construct of the present invention, Preferably, the soluble T-cell receptor constructs are applied to patients by intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular infusion or injections, respectively, or by application to the mucosa of the respiratory tract by inhalation or by spraying. Soluble T-cell receptor constructs can be applied to patients: by intravenous infusions,by subcutaneous injection or infusion,by intramuscular injection,by inhalation or by spraying to the mucosal surfaces of the respiratory tract. Suitable dose ranges for application of soluble T-cell receptor constructs vary between 1 mg to 10 000 mg dependent on the application method and application site. Soluble T-cell receptors can bind to cells expressing GPC3 peptides on their HLA-A2 molecules, namely liver cancer cells, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, (or cells of other cancers expressing GPC3) in which GPC3 peptide 367 or GPC3 peptide 326 is presented by MHC I. Soluble T-cell receptors can induce destruction of the cells via different methods, such as radiation by linked radionuclides or killing by toxins such as pseudomonas exotoxin. In addition, soluble T-cell receptors with linked Fc-domains can redirect and activate NK-cells and/or monocytes for the lysis of liver cancer cells, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, or cells of other cancers expressing GPC3. Similarly, soluble T-cell receptors linked to anti-CD3-antibodies can redirect and activate T-cells for lysis of liver cancer cells, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, or cells of other cancers expressing GPC3. In one embodiment the method of the invention is for detecting liver cancer, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or other cancers expressing GPC3, comprising the in vitro staining of liver cancer cells, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, or cells of other cancers expressing GPC3, by using the soluble T-cell receptor construct of the present invention which is labelled. The label can be fluorophor(s), gold and/or radionuclide(s). Soluble T-cell receptors linked to fluorescent molecules such as fluorescein can be used to stain liver cancer cells, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, or cells of other cancers expressing GPC3 in vitro. For this purpose, liver cancer cells, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, or cells of other cancers expressing GPC3, are incubated in vitro with the soluble T-cell receptor constructs, and cells expressing HLA-A2/GPC3 peptide-complexes on the cell surface can be detected according to their fluorescence by a Fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) or by microscope. Alternatively, labeled soluble T-cell receptor constructs (e.g. with flourochromes, gold or radionuclides) are injected into a subject or patient and allow detection and subsequent destruction of GP3 positive tumor, tumor metastasis or minimal residual disease after tumor resection. The soluble TCR-constructs of the invention are suitable to be directly used for the detection and destruction of liver cancer cells, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, or cells of other cancers expressing GPC3, without the need of T-cells.

Preferably, the composition comprises at least two peptides according to the present invention or at least two nucleic acids according to the present invention. The compositions according to the invention can further comprise a carrier and/oran adjuvant. Suitable adjuvants are known in the art.

In one embodiment, the carrier is a virus particle or parts thereof, an envelope protein of a viral vector or of a virus particle, a nanocarrier or a liposomal compound enveloping the peptide(s) in a micellular structure.

Further suitable excipient(s) are known to the skilled artisan. A peptide of the invention or the peptide comprised in a vaccine of the invention does not comprise the full-length glypican-3 (GPC3) protein. As discussed above, the present invention provides the use of the vaccine of the present invention for preventing and/or treating liver cancer, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or other cancers expressing GPC3. As discussed above, the present invention provides a method of preventing and/or treating liver cancer, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or other cancers expressing GPC3, comprising the step of administering a peptide of the present invention, a nucleic acid molecule of the present invention, a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention or a vaccine of the present invention to a subject in need thereof. Further description of preferred embodiments The inventors have identified T cell clones that specifically recognise Glypican-3 expressing cells and demonstrate effector functions such as cytokine production and effective killing of target cells. The T cell clones were generated using an allorestricted stimulation of T cells with peptide or mRNA pulsed dendritic cells (DCs). After successful generation and characterisation of functional T cell clones, the T cell receptor (TCR) sequence was sequenced and subsequently cloned into a retroviral-vector construct. The retroviral-vector based transfer of previously cloned T cell receptors can be used to equip T cells with the GPC3-specific effector function. Functionality of transduced T cells was evaluated in vitro. The identified GPC3 specific TCRs are suitable for adoptive T cell therapy of HCC. HCC expresses like many other tumours tumour-associated antigens (TAAs), one of them is glypican-3 (GPC3). T cells that would naturally respond to TAAs are removed from the system in a process called negative selection during T cell development because TAAs are derived from self-tissue. Nevertheless T cells can be reactivated against tumours by genetic engineering more precisely insertion of a TAA-specific T cell receptor. T cells carrying the TCRs of the present invention can recognize and specifically eliminate GPC3 expressing tumour cells. Genes coding for the GPC3 specific TCRs of the invention can be inserted into patients' T cells to enable them to recognize and kill cancer cells, especially HCC. Genetic modifications of the TCRs of the present invention to improve migration of T cells into the tumour tissue, to enhance proliferation or resistance to tumour-derived immunosuppressive factors are optional. Additionally, the insertion of suicidal genes that allow the elimination of transferred T cells may be advantageous. T cells that were ex vivo equipped with the TCRs of the present invention can be transferred back to the patient where they can exert their anti-tumour activity. According to the present invention, GPC3 peptide 367 presented by MHC-I is recognized by T cells carrying the T cell receptors of the present invention or GPC3 peptide 326 presented by MHC-I is recognized by T cells carrying the T cell receptors of the present invention, respectively. Furthermore it has been shown that GPC3+ human hepatoma cells are effectively killed by said T cells. Hence, adoptive T-cell immunotherapy with the TCRs of the present invention allows recognition as well as cytotoxic elimination of glypican-3 (GPC3) expressing malignant cells, which makes the TCRs of the present invention a very promising tool to treat HCC patients. Identification of immunodominant GPC3 peptides Immunodominant epitopes for GPC3 have not been described yet. In this study we used Ultra Nano HPLC coupled on-line to the Q Exactive mass spectrometer to obtain a comprehensive HLA class I peptidome from a GPC3 and HLA-A2 positive hepatoma cell line. The resulting data were analysed using the MaxQuant bioinformatics platform. Two HLA-A2 bound GPC3 peptides were identified, referred to as "GPC3 peptide 367" (GPC3367: FIDKKVLKV) and "GPC3 peptide 326" (GPC3326: TIHDSIQYV), wherein GPC3 peptide 326 is described in Komori et al., 2006. The knowledge of these two peptides enables us to target GPC3 epitopes that are presented on GPC3 positive HCC cells. See also Figure 2. T cells and TCR specific for peptide GPC3367 We have identified and cloned the T cell receptor (TCR) specific for GPC3 peptide 367 from respective T cell clones. This TCR is also referred to as P1-1. The T cell receptor sequence coding for the variable parts of alpha and beta chain of P1A was codon optimized to increase the level of expression after viral transfer into T cells. Furthermore the constant domains were exchanged with murine constant domains to avoid miss pairing with endogenous TCR chains and hence ensure optimal expression (see Figure 5). T cells engrafted with this optimized GPC3-specific TCR P1-1 showed strong GPC3 MHC streptamer binding. When co-cultured with GPC3 peptide loaded target cells or a GPC3 expressing hepatoma cell line (HepG2), TCR P1-1 transduced T cells secreted IFNγ, TNFα and IL2 and delocalized the degranulation marker Lamp-1 (see Figure 6A and Figure 8). Cytotoxicity was observed by killing of HepG2 cells that are GPC3 and HLA-A2 positive. The cytotoxic effect depends on GPC3 peptide presentation on HLA-A2 since no killing was observed on HLA-A2- GPC3+ Huh7 cells (see Figure 6B). Killing of target cell already occurred at low effector: target (E:T) ratios of 0,1:1 and up to 60% of killing was reached when an E:T ratio of 1:1 was used. More detailed investigation of the killing capacity showed very rapid killing of around 90% of target cells when E:T ratios of 1:1 or higher were used. At lower E:T ratios around 50% of target cells were killed by P1-1 equipped T cells (Figure 7A). To analyse the TCR avidity TCR P1-1 transduced T cells were incubated with T2 cells loaded with peptide GPC3 367 in different concentration. A clear concentration dependent IFNγ secretion was observed that indicated a medium avidity of the TCR of the present invention (Figure 7B). TCR specific for peptide GPC3326 We have identified and cloned the T cell receptor (TCR) specific for GPC3 peptide 326 from respective T cell clones. This TCR is also referred to as P2-1. The following examples and drawings illustrate the present invention without, however, limiting the same thereto. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 .

Time schedule for the allorestricted stimulation of T cells. according to Wilde et al., 2012. DCs are prepared from fresh blood, maturated and electroporated with HLA-A2 RNA. GPC3 can be loaded either in form of peptide or GPC3 mRNA can be electroporated together with HLA-A2. Ten hours after electroporation DCs are co-incubated with CLTs from the same HLA-A2 negative donor. On day 14 and 21, the GPC3-specific HLA-A2-restricted T cell cultures are stained with multimer and sorted via fluorescence activated cell sorting. The sorted T cells are cloned in limiting dilution cultures or expanded as bulk lines. Functional assay for evaluation of their specific effector functions are performed. Figure 4 . A) Streptamer staining (P1; 367) of stimulated T cells, corresponding T cell lines, and one exemplary T cell clone. Streptamer binding T cell population was enriched from 0.6% in the primary co-culture to 57% in the T cell line. T cell clones showed strong streptamer binding. B) T cells clones specific for P1 or P2 were identified in an IFNγ secretion assay. Specific T cell clones released IFNγ on T2 cells loaded with GPC3 peptides but not on T2 cells without or with control peptides. Figure 5 .

GPC3+ HLA-A2+ HepG2 cells and GPC3+ HLA-A2- Huh7 cells were incubated with P1-1 transduced T cells at different effector target (E:T) ratios. P1-1 enables T cells to effectively kill target cells at low E:T ratios in an HLA-A2 dependent manner. Figure 7.

EXAMPLES 1. Material and Methods 1.1 PBMC and cell lines Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy human donors were isolated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. T2 is a HLA-A2+ TAP deficient human lymphoma cell line that was used as a target in IFNγ-release assays. LCL-B27 is a HLA-B27+ B-lymphoblastoid cell line that was used as a feeder cell line for unspecific T cell restimulation. Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (293T) cells were used as producer cell line of virus supernatant for T cell transduction. HepG2 is a human hepatoma cell line expressing HLA-A2 and GPC3, which was used as a target in killing assays. Mammalian cell culture was performed under sterile cell culture conditions and cell were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2. 1.2 Media All T cell cultures were maintained in human T cell medium (hTCM) compromised of RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10 % human serum, 4 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 6 µg/ml gentamycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1x Non-Essential Amino Acids (NEAA). Human serum was isolated in our laboratory from healthy donors. Dendritic cell cultures were maintained in DC medium consisting of very low endotoxin RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1.5 % human serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. LCL and T2 cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, 4 mM L-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1x NEAA. HepG2 cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum, 4 mM L-glutamine, 100 IUhnl penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1x NEAA. 1.3 Cytokines, peptides multimers and antibodies Recombinant human IL-4 and IL-6 were obtained from GellGenix. Recombinant human GM-CSF, IL-7, IL-15, TNFα, IL-1β, PGE2 and IL-2 were purchased from Genzyme, Promokine, Peprotech, Miltenyi Biotec, R&D, Pfizer and Novartis, respectively. The HLA-A2-restricted peptides representing defined epitopes from GPC3 (367: FIDKKVLKV; 326: TIHDSIQYV) were synthesized by iba. HLA-A2-GPC3-multimers were generated by AG Busch, Institute for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Hygiene, TU Munich (Knabel et al., 2002). Strap-Tactin PE for labelling of MHC-I multimers was purchased from iba. Anti-human CD8-APC, CD8-PE, anti-CD14, anti-CD83 and anti-CD80 antibodies were obtained from BD, Immunotools, eBioscience and Immunotech, respectively. Propidiumiodide (1mg/ml) was obtained from Roth. Anti-human CD3 (OKT3) was kindly provided by AG Kremmer, Institute for Molecular Immunology, Helmholtz Zentrum Munich. 1.4 Generation of dendritic cells (DC) for T cell stimulation To generate DC PBMC from a healthy HLA-A2 negative donor were resuspended in DC medium and plated at 5x106 cell per 75 cm2 NUNC culture flask. After incubated for 1.5 hours at 37°C non-adherent cells were removed by extensive washing. The remaining adherent monocytes were cultured in medium containing 100 ng/ml GM-CSF and 20 ng/ml IL-4 for 24 hours. On day 2 immature DC were differentiated by addition of maturation cytokines (10 ng/ml TNFα, 10 ng/ml IL-1β, 15 ng/ml IL-6 and 1 µg/ml PGE2) directly to the culture. DC were incubated for an additional day before mature DC were harvested. Maturation was confirmed by staining with anti-CD14, anti-CD83 and anti-CD80 and subsequent flow cytometry a FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences). Mature DC were transfected with GPC3 and HLA-A2 by RNA electroporation. 2x106 cells were resuspended in 200 µl OptiMEM I medium and mixed with 25 µg HLA-A2 RNA and 50 µg GPC3 RNA. The DC-RNA mixture was placed into a 0.4 cm electroporation cuvette and incubated on ice for 3 min. Electroporation was performed with the Gene Pulser Xcell (Bio-Rad) using the exponential electroporation protocol at 300 V and 150 µF. HLA-A2 RNA and GPC3 RNA were in vitro (ivt) transcribed using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 kit and Poly(A) tailing kit (both Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instructions. HLA-A2 and GPC3 expression was assed via flow cytometry. 1.5 Allorestricted stimulation of T cells CD8+ T lymphocytes were enriched from total PBMCs via negative selection using the Dynabeads® Untouched™ Human CD8 T Cells Kit from Invitrogen. Primary cultures contained 1×106 CD8+ T cells and 1x105 HLA-A2 and GPC3 ivt-RNA pulsed mature DC in 2 ml of hTCM medium per well of a 24-well tissue culture plate. 5 ng/ml IL-7 was added immediately to the stimulation on day 0. 50 IU/ml IL-2 were added on day 2 and thereafter every 3rd day. Primed T cells were restimulated seven days later using freshly generated ivt-RNA pulsed mature DC. 1.6 Multimer staining and cloning of T cells After 14 days of T cell stimulation HLA-A2-restricted GPC3-specific T cells were detected by MHC-1-multimer staining. GPC3 MHC-multimers were labelled with streptactin-PE prior to staining. For each 1x106 T cells 0.2 µg PE-labelled GPC3 MHC-multimers were used. T cells were incubated with PE-labelled GPC3 MHC-multimers for 20 min in 50 µl PBS + 0.5 % human serum on ice and in the dark. APC-labelled anti-human CD8 was added and incubated for an additional 20 min, before washing and analysis by flow cytometry. Dead cells were excluded by propidium iodide staining. For sorting up to 10x106 cells were stained as described above and sorted on a FACS Aria sorter (BD Biosciences). Sorted CD8+ GPC3 MHC-multimer+ T cells were cloned by limiting dilution. Therefore 0.3 CD8+ GPC3 MHC-multimer+ T cells were seeded per well of a 96-well round-bottom plate. In Addition each well contained a feeder mixture consisting of 1x105 allogeneic PBMC (irradiated to 35 Gy), 1x104 LCL-B27 (irradiated to 50 Gy), 30 ng/ml OKT3 and 50 IU/ml IL-2 in 200 µl of hTCM. After 2 weeks of incubation at 37°C aliquots of wells containing proliferating cells were analysed with regard to their GPC3 specificity in an IFN-γ release assay and by multimer staining as described above. GPC3-speicific CD8+ GPC3 MHC-multimer+ T cells were further expanded by restimulation with the feeder mixture as discribed. 1.7 IFN-γ release assay T2 cells, which were used as targets, were loaded with 5 µM GPC3 peptide for 1.5 h prior to co-incubation with T cells. 2x103 T cells were co-incubated with 1x104 peptide loaded T2 cells in round-bottom 96-well plates yielding in an effector to target ratio of 0.2:1. T cells co-incubated with mock-peptide loaded T2 cells served as negative controls. After 24 h of co-culture supernatants were harvested and investigated by standard anti-human IFN-γ ELISA (BioLegend). 1.8 T cell receptor (TCRs) analysis and cloning of reactive TCR For TCR analysis of GPC3 specific T cell clones RNA was extracted from T cell clones with Trizol and cDNA was synthesized using superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Variable parts of α- and β-chains were amplified with degenerated primer (Table 1) that cover 99 % of the TCR variable gene segment families followed by agarose gel purification and DNA sequencing (GATC).

Constant chains were murinized to improve pairing of the transgenic TCR and α- and β-chain were linked via a P2A element. 1.9 Retroviral TCR transfer into human PBMC 293T cells were co-transfected with 2 µg retroviral plasmid pMP71-GPC3-TCR, 1 µg pcDNA3.1-Mo-MLV and 1 µg pALF-10A1 the later representing plasmids that carry the retroviral genes for gag/pol and env, respectively. Transfection was performed with 10 µl lipofectamine according to the standard lipofectamin transfection protocol. Freshly isolated human PBMCs were activated on anti-CD28 and OKT3 coated 24-well plates in hTCM supplemented with 300 IU/ml IL-2 for two days. Activated PBMCs were transduced twice, on day 3 and 4. Virus containing supernatant of transfected 293T cells was harvested two days after transfection and added to RetroNectin-coated 24-well culture plates. The virus was spinoculated for 2 h at 32°C and 2000 g. After centrifugation media was replaced with 1x106 activated T cells/well in hTCM supplemented with 100 IU/ml IL-2. T cells were spinoculated with 1000 g for 10 min at 32°C. After 24 h of incubation medium was replaced by fresh medium containing 50 IU/ml IL2 and T cells were incubated for additional 48 h. Transduced PBMC were analysed by GPC3 MHC-multimer staining and in functional assay at multiple time points. 1.10 Functional assays Transduced PBMC were analysed with regard to their IFN-γ secretion capacity after co-incubation with different target cells as described above. Peptide concentrations and effector to target ratios varied. To assess killing ability of transduced PBMC the cells were co-incubated with HepG2 cells that were seeded on E-plate 96 culture plates (Roche). Target cell viability was measured on the XCelligence (Roche) over time. Alternatively cell titre blue assay was performed after 24 h of co-incubation. 2. Results 2.1 Identification of immunodominant GPC3 peptides presented on MHC class I molecules of human hepatoma cells Immunodominant epitopes for GPC3 have not been described yet. In this study we used Ultra Nano HPLC coupled on-line to the Q Exactive mass spectrometer to obtain a comprehensive HLA class I peptidome from a GPC3 and HLA-A2 positive hepatoma cell line. The resulting data were analysed using the MaxQuant bioinformatics platform. Two HLA-A2 bound GPC3 peptides could be identified, herein referred to as GPC3 peptide 367 or GPC3367 or GPC3-P1: FIDKKVLKV [SEQ ID NO. 14] and GPC3 peptide 326 or GPC3326 or GPC3-P2: (described in Komori et al., 2006) TIHDSIQYV [SEQ ID NO. 16]. The knowledge of these two peptides enables us to target GPC3 epitopes that are presented on GPC3 positive HCC cells. 2.2 In vitro production of Glypican-3 mRNA and expression of GPC3 in DCs after mRNA electroporation A construct containing GPC3 has been cloned, from which GPC3 mRNA can be produced. Glypican-3 expression has been shown from the plasmid pcDNA3.1(-)GPC3 after transfection of 293T cells. Expression of GPC3 from this construct after electroporation of DCs was optimized. We were able to detect GPC3 after electroporation of DCs. GPC3 was also expressed when co-electroporated with HLA-A2. HLA-A2 expression was stable for at least 24 h. In contrast GPC3 could only be detected up to 2 h post electroporation and was rapidly degraded thereafter. 2.3 AUorestricted stimulation of T cells To isolate tumour reactive high avidity T cells, an allo-restricted stimulation approach (see Figure 3) was used, as described by Wilde et. al., 2012. For stimulation of naïve T cells, autologous dendritic cells were co-transfected with GPC3 and HLA-A2 RNA and used as antigen presenting cells. T cells from the naïve T cell repertoire of HLA-A2 negative donors were co-cultured with and expanded on these HLA-A2+ GPC3+ DCs. After two weeks, MHC streptamer-positive CD8+ T cells specific for both targeted GPC3 epitopes were detected (<1%). We were able to enrich these cell populations further to 57% GPC3-P1- and 35% GPC3-P2-MHC streptamer-positive T cell lines and grew T cell clones from them. In a co-culture with GPC3-P1/ -P2 peptide loaded T2 cells we identified T cell clones displaying specific effector function by IFNγ secretion (see Figure 4). The specific effector function could be verified in an intracellular cytokine staining for IFNγ and TNFα. Furthermore T cell clones secreted IFNγ when co-cultured with HLA-A2+ GPC3+ hepatoma cells (HepG2). Functional T cell clones showed strong GPC3 MHC streptamer binding. 2.4 T cells specific for peptide GPC3367 We have identified and cloned the T cell receptor (TCR) specific for GPC3 peptide 367 from our T cell clones. This TCR is also referred to as P1-1. The T cell receptor sequence coding for the variable parts of alpha and beta chain of P1-1 were codon optimized to increase the level of expression after viral transfer into T cells. Furthermore the constant domains were exchanged with murine constant domains to avoid miss pairing with endogenous TCR chains and hence ensure optimal expression (see Figure 5). T cells engrafted with this optimized GPC3 specific TCR showed strong GPC3 MHC streptamer binding. When co-cultured with GPC3 peptide loaded target cells or a GPC3 expressing hepatoma cell line (HepG2), GPC3 TCR transduced T cells secreted IFNγ, TNFα, IL2 and the degranulation marker Lamp-1 (see Figure 6A and data not shown). Furthermore cytotoxicity was observed by killing of up to 60% of HepG2 cells (see Figure 6B). The features disclosed in the foregoing description, in the claims and/or in the accompanying drawings may, both separately and in any combination thereof, be material for realizing the invention in diverse forms thereof.
