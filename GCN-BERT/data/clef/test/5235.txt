(b) 3-Bromo-6-fluoro-1-(p-tolylsulfonyl)indole
To a cold (0 °C) solution of 6-fluoro-1-(p-tolylsulfonyl)indole (16.1 g, 55.6 mmol) in dichloromethane (166 ml) was added dropwise over a period of 45 min a solution of bromine (3.13 ml, 61.2 mmol) in dichloromethane (40 ml) . The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 30 min. then saturated aqueous Na2S2O3 (150 ml) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (2x). The combined organic layers were subsequently washed with 5% NaHCO3-solution, and brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. The residue was triturated with heptane/ethyl acetate 80/20 v/v% (100 ml) for 45 min at 60 °C. The white solid was filtered and dried under vacuum to give 20.01 g (92%) of the title compound
