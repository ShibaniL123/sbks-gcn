FIELD Provided herein are pharmaceutically acceptable sodium thiosulfate (such as sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate) and pharmaceutical compositions thereof. Also provided herein are methods for determining the total non-purgeable organic carbon in a sodium thiosulfate-containing sample. Further provided herein are methods for producing pharmaceutically acceptable sodium thiosulfate. Still further provided herein are methods of treatment comprising the administration of pharmaceutically acceptable sodium thiosulfate. BACKGROUND Sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate has numerous industrial applications including such uses as removing chlorine from solutions, bleaching paper pulp, and extracting silver from ores. It is also used as a fixer in photography, a mordant in dyeing and printing textiles, and a pharmaceutical ingredient. Even though thousands of metric tons of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate are produced annually, only a few hundred kilograms are utilized pharmaceutically for the production of sodium thiosulfate injection as currently indicated as a treatment for cyanide poisoning or for the production of a lotion containing sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate for the treatment of tinea versicolor. It has been recently reported that sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate is an effective treatment for calciphylaxis (Ackermann et al., Archives of Dermatology 2007, 143(10): 1336-1337). It has also been reported that sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate is an effective treatment for vascular calcification (O'Neill, Kidney International 2008, 74(11): 1376-1378). It has been reported that sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate is an effective treatment to prevent platinum-induced ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity that is associated with the use of platinum-containing chemotherapeutic agents (Skinner, Current Opinions in Oncology 1995, 7(4): 310-315). The manufacture of pharmaceutical products in the United States is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since the passage of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act in 1938, the FDA has required new pharmaceutical products and their corresponding active ingredients to be manufactured in accordance with the exacting requirements of “pharmaceutical grade” Good Manufacturing Practices as detailed in the United States Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR 211. Because of the relatively small quantity of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate that is currently used to formulate pharmaceutical products, no raw material supplier presently manufactures sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate in accordance with “pharmaceutical grade” Good Manufacturing Practices. In addition to regulating manufacturing practices, the FDA establishes stringent quality specifications for each new pharmaceutical product and its corresponding active ingredients. A pharmaceutical product is classified as “new” if it was introduced to the market after the passage of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act in 1938. As mandated in this Act, the FDA requires a new pharmaceutical product and its active ingredients to be manufactured in accordance with “pharmaceutical grade” Good Manufacturing Practices and to meet applicable quality specifications. When the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act was enacted in 1938, pharmaceuticals that were already on the market were classified as “grandfathered drugs” and were permitted to remain on the market without formal FDA approval if the product and its labeling remain unchanged. Any change to the product or its labeling would cause the “grandfathered drug” to become a “new” drug that is subject to FDA-imposed regulations and quality standards. Currently available sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate injection that is labeled solely for use as a treatment of cyanide poisoning and sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate-containing lotion that is labeled solely for use as a treatment of tinea versicolor are “grandfathered medications”. Consequently, the product formulations and corresponding quality specifications have remain unchanged for decades. In anticipation of the receipt of a New Drug Application for a sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate-containing pharmaceutical product, the FDA recently announced that sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate raw material for a new pharmaceutical product must be manufactured in accordance with “pharmaceutical grade” Good Manufacturing Practices and must conform to a new set of quality specifications. This new set of quality specifications is more expansive and stringent than the existing quality specifications. Currently available sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate raw material does not meet the new set of FDA quality standards and is unsuitable for use in the formulation of a new pharmaceutical product. Consequently, there is a clear and unmet need for purified sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate raw material that is manufactured in accordance with “pharmaceutical grade” Good Manufacturing Practices and that meets the new set of quality specifications in order to translate recent sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate-related research discoveries into FDA-approved clinical therapies. Another hurdle in developing pharmaceutical grade sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate is the lack of an effective analytical method to determine total non-purgeable organic carbon in a sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate-containing sample, which is one of the new FDA-imposed quality standards. The conventional method for total non-purgeable organic carbon determination requires that any inorganic carbon must be removed before measuring the organic carbon content in a sample. This is typically achieved by adding acid. At low pH, the inorganic carbon and volatile organic carbon are converted to carbon dioxide, which is then purged from the sample. The sample is then routed to a combustion chamber with a catalyst and a temperature of approximately 680° C. to convert any remaining non-purgeable (non-volatile) organic carbon to carbon dioxide. The quantity of carbon dioxide thus produced is then determined using an infrared detector. However, this conventional method cannot be used to analyze a sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate-containing sample. When exposed to acid, sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate degrades to sulfur which can precipitate during the analysis. Salt from sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate may also precipitate during the analysis. Precipitants can damage laboratory equipment and interfere with analysis. Therefore, there is also a need for an analytical method for determining total non-purgeable organic carbon in a sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate-containing sample.

The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form may be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art, including direct compression, dry or wet granulation followed by compression, melt-granulation followed by compression. 4.4.2. Osmotic Controlled Release Devices The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form may be fabricated using an osmotic controlled release device, including one-chamber system, two-chamber system, asymmetric membrane technology (AMT), and extruding core system (ECS). In general, such devices have at least two components: (a) the core which contains the active ingredient(s); and (b) a semipermeable membrane with at least one delivery port, which encapsulates the core. The semipermeable membrane controls the influx of water to the core from an aqueous environment of use so as to cause drug release by extrusion through the delivery port(s). In addition to the active ingredient(s), the core of the osmotic device optionally includes an osmotic agent, which creates a driving force for transport of water from the environment of use into the core of the device. One class of osmotic agents water-swellable hydrophilic polymers, which are also referred to as “osmopolymers” and “hydrogels,” including, but not limited to, hydrophilic vinyl and acrylic polymers, polysaccharides such as calcium alginate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(methacrylic) acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), crosslinked PVP, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/PVP copolymers, PVA/PVP copolymers with hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, hydrophilic polyurethanes containing large PEO blocks, sodium croscarmellose, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxyethyl, cellulose (CEC), sodium alginate, polycarbophil, gelatin, xanthan gum, and sodium starch glycolate. The other class of osmotic agents is osmogens, which are capable of imbibing water to affect an osmotic pressure gradient across the barrier of the surrounding coating. Suitable osmogens include, but are not limited to, inorganic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphates, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate; sugars, such as dextrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, raffinose, sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and xylitol, organic acids, such as ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, sebacic acid, sorbic acid, adipic acid, edetic acid, glutamic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid; urea; and mixtures thereof. Osmotic agents of different dissolution rates may be employed to influence how rapidly the active ingredient(s) is initially delivered from the dosage form. For example, amorphous sugars, such as MANNOGEM™ EZ (SPI Pharma, Lewes, Del.) can be used to provide faster delivery during the first couple of hours to promptly produce the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of the remaining amount to maintain the desired level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In this case, the active ingredient(s) is released at such a rate to replace the amount of the active ingredient metabolized and excreted. The core may also include a wide variety of other excipients and carriers as described herein to enhance the performance of the dosage form or to promote stability or processing. Materials useful in forming the semipermeable membrane include various grades of acrylics, vinyls, ethers, polyamides, polyesters, and cellulosic derivatives that are water-permeable and water-insoluble at physiologically relevant pHs, or are susceptible to being rendered water-insoluble by chemical alteration, such as crosslinking Examples of suitable polymers useful in forming the coating, include plasticized, unplasticized, and reinforced cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, CA propionate, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CA ethyl carbamate, CAP, CA methyl carbamate, CA succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), CA dimethylaminoacetate, CA ethyl carbonate, CA chloroacetate, CA ethyl oxalate, CA methyl sulfonate, CA butyl sulfonate, CA p-toluene sulfonate, agar acetate, amylose triacetate, beta glucan acetate, beta glucan triacetate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetate, triacetate of locust bean gum, hydroxylated ethylene-vinylacetate, EC, PEG, PPG, PEG/PPG copolymers, PVP, HEC, HPC, CMC, CMEC, HPMC, HPMCP, HPMCAS, HPMCAT, poly(acrylic) acids and esters and poly-(methacrylic) acids and esters and copolymers thereof, starch, dextran, dextrin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, polyalkenes, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. Semipermeable membrane may also be a hydrophobic microporous membrane, wherein the pores are substantially filled with a gas and are not wetted by the aqueous medium but are permeable to water vapor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,119. Such hydrophobic but water-vapor permeable membrane are typically composed of hydrophobic polymers such as polyalkenes, polyethylene, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylic acid derivatives, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. The delivery port(s) on the semipermeable membrane may be formed post-coating by mechanical or laser drilling. Delivery port(s) may also be formed in situ by erosion of a plug of water-soluble material or by rupture of a thinner portion of the membrane over an indentation in the core. In addition, delivery ports may be formed during coating process, as in the case of asymmetric membrane coatings of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,612,059 and 5,698,220. The total amount of the active ingredient(s) released and the release rate can substantially by modulated via the thickness and porosity of the semipermeable membrane, the composition of the core, and the number, size, and position of the delivery ports. The pharmaceutical compositions in an osmotic controlled-release dosage form may further comprise additional conventional excipients or carriers as described herein to promote performance or processing of the formulation. The osmotic controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art (see, Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, supra; Santus and Baker, J.

Combination Therapy The sodium thiosulfate provided herein may also be combined or used in combination with other therapeutic agents useful in the treatment and/or prevention of the diseases and conditions provided herein. As used herein, the term “in combination” includes the use of more than one therapy (e.g., one or more prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents). However, the use of the term “in combination” does not restrict the order in which therapies (e.g., prophylactic and/or therapeutic agents) are administered to a subject with a disease or disorder. A first therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or therapeutic agent such as a compound provided herein) can be administered prior to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks before), concomitantly with, or subsequent to (e.g., 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks after) the administration of a second therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or therapeutic agent) to the subject. Triple therapy is also contemplated herein. As used herein, the term “synergistic” includes a combination of the sodium thiosulfate provided herein and another therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or therapeutic agent) which has been or is currently being used to treat, prevent, or manage a disease or disorder, which is more effective than the additive effects of the therapies. A synergistic effect of a combination of therapies (e.g., a combination of prophylactic or therapeutic agents) permits the use of lower dosages of one or more of the therapies and/or less frequent administration of said therapies to a subject with a disorder. The ability to utilize lower dosages of a therapy (e.g., a prophylactic or therapeutic agent) and/or to administer said therapy less frequently reduces the toxicity associated with the administration of said therapy to a subject without reducing the efficacy of said therapy in the prevention or treatment of a disorder). In addition, a synergistic effect can result in improved efficacy of agents in the prevention or treatment of a disorder. Finally, a synergistic effect of a combination of therapies (e.g., a combination of prophylactic or therapeutic agents) may avoid or reduce adverse or unwanted side effects associated with the use of either therapy alone. The sodium thiosulfate provided herein can be administered in combination or alternation with another therapeutic agent. In combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more agents are administered together, whereas in alternation or sequential-step therapy, an effective dosage of each agent is administered serially or sequentially. The dosages given will depend on absorption, inactivation and excretion rates of the drug as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art. It is to be noted that dosage values will also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens and schedules should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions.

Example 1 Preparation of Pharmaceutical Grade Sodium Thiosulfate Pentahydrate Under nitrogen, 57 kilograms of sulfur and deionized water (799.1 kilograms) were charged to an inerted 500 gallon reactor system with an Orion Ross combination pH probe. The slurry was stirred and 161.4 kilograms of sodium sulfite was charged to the reactor. The reactor was heated to between 95 and 100° C. for 4 hours. The pH of the slurry within the reactor after 4 hours was 7.3. The reactor was cooled to 20+/−5° C. The pH of the cooled slurry was 6.6. 300 grams of sodium hydroxide 50 weight % solution was added to the reactor contents to increase the pH of the slurry within the reactor to 7.4. The contents of reactor were filtered through an Estrella filter. The resulting filtrate was distilled under vacuum at 50 to 100° C. to a specific gravity of 1.40. Maintaining the temperature of the solution at 50+/−5° C., 300 grams of activated carbon was added to the solution. The solution was stirred for one hour and 3 minutes and subsequently filtered with a bag filter and to remove the activated carbon. The filtered solution was cooled to 20+/−5° C. and 15 grams of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate crystals were added to the solution. The solution was then cooled to 5+/−5° C. and stirred for 15 hours and 2 minutes. The contents within the reactor consisting of both solids and liquid were filtered through an Aurora filter under an inert environment. The mother liquor was used to rinse solids from the walls of the reactor. Solids were loaded onto drying trays and placed into a drying oven under full vacuum with a nitrogen bleed for 8 hours at 35° C. Drying continued after 8 hours until in-process testing confirmed that the water content (Loss on Drying) of the material was between 34.0 and 36.8%. The dried solid had a final mass of 112.5 kilograms (36% yield). The analysis of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate provided herein from the purification procedure is summarized in Table 1.

Example 2 Method of Determining the Total Non-Purgeable Organic Carbon in Sodium Thiosulfate Pentahydrate Total non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC) was determined using an InnovOx laboratory TOC Analyzer (GE Analytical Instruments, Inc., Boulder, Colo.). Water used for standard, reagent, and sample preparation had total organic carbon (TOC) of no greater than 0.10 ppm. Phosphoric acid was ACS reagent grade. Sodium persulfate was obtained from General Electric (GE Part # APK68050-01, Fairfield, Conn.). Sucrose USP was used as a reference standard. Compressed nitrogen has no greater than 1 ppm CO2 and no greater than 1 ppm THC. Phosphoric acid (6 N) used as acidification solution was prepared by adding approximately 100 mL of water to a 250 mL volumetric flask, followed by the slow addition of 100 mL of phosphoric acid and adding additional water to make the final volume of 250 mL. Phosphoric acid (6%) solution was prepared by adding 120 mL of 6N phosphoric acid solution to a 2,000 mL volumetric flask, and adding water to bring the volume to 100 mL at room temperature. Sodium persulfate solution (30%) used as an oxidizer was prepared by adding 150 0.1 g of sodium persulfate to a 500 mL volumetric flask, and adding additional water to make the final volume of 500 mL, after the sodium persulfate was dissolved. The solution was allowed to sit for 3 days prior to use, and used within 14 days of the preparation. The sucrose stock standard (250 ppm carbon based on 0.50 mg carbon/1.2 mg sucrose) was prepared by dissolving 9 mg of sucrose in 15 mL of water. TOC standard (10 ppm) was prepared by adding 4 mL of the sucrose stock standard to a 100 mL volumetric flask, followed by the addition of water to bring the volume to 100 mL at room temperature. TOC standard (2 ppm) was prepare by adding 10 mL of the 10 ppm TOC standard to a 50 mL volumetric flask, followed by the addition of water to bring the volume to 50 mL at room temperature. TOC standard (0.5 ppm) was prepare by adding 5 mL of the 10 ppm TOC standard to a 100 mL volumetric flask, followed by the addition of water to bring the volume to 100 mL at room temperature. The sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate sample solution was prepared by adding 5.0 g of a sample into a 100 mL volumetric flask, followed by the addition of 6% phosphoric acid solution to bring the volume to 100 mL at room temperature. The sample solution was centrifuged for 15 min, and allowed to stand overnight to allow the precipitate to settle. The InnovOx instrument was calibrated with 6% phosphoric acid solution (blank), and the 0.5 ppm, 2 ppm, and 10 ppm TOC standards, using the instrument parameters as shown in Table 2.

Samples were analyzed using the following instrument parameters as shown in Table 3. TABLE 3 Number Points 4 Range 0-1000 ppm Acid 0% Oxidizer 45.0% Sparge 4.0 min Flush Dilution Blank Correction Off Calibration Sodium Thiosulfate Pentahydrate Cal Replicates 6 Rejects 2 The 2 ppm TOC standard was run before and after each sample analysis. The system suitability requirements were that i) the RSD for the 2 ppm TOC standard must be no greater than 15%; ii) the percentage of theoretical response (% T) for the 2 ppm TOC standard determinations must be no less than 80% and no greater than 120%; which was calculated as follows: [in-line-formulae]% T=100×A/B; [/in-line-formulae] where: A was the result determined by the analyzer (ppm); and B was the 2 ppm standard TOC concentration (ppm); iii) for any sample that had a sample response at or above the LOQ to five times the LOQ, the RSD must be no greater than 25%; or for any sample that had a sample response more than five times the LOQ, the RSD must be no greater than 15%. The total non-purgeable organic carbon in each sample was calculated as follows: [in-line-formulae]NPOC=A×B/C; [/in-line-formulae] where: A was the result determined by the analyzer (ppm); B was sample dilution volume (mL); and C was sample mass (g). In calculating total non-purgeable organic carbon, if A is less than the LOD, A in the formula was replaced with LOD for calculation to provide an upper limit for the total non-purgeable organic carbon value. If A is less than the LOQ, but more than the LOD, the total non-purgeable organic carbon value as calculated provided an approximate value and the LOQ set an upper limit for the total non-purgeable organic carbon. Example 3 Method of Determining Sulfide Impurity in Sodium Thiosulfate Pentahydrate Drug Substance This protocol describes the procedure for qualification of a wet-chemistry test for detection of sulfide in sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate drug substance and drug product samples. The sulfide impurity, if present in samples, is detected as lead(II) sulfide, which forms gray precipitate. The method-detection-limit is set at 10 ppm or 10 μg/g of sulfide, based on the drug product concentration of 250 mg/mL sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate in solution, and use of 1 mL of drug product for testing. a. Protocol NaOH (0.01 N) reagent was prepared by dissolving approximately 4.0 g of sodium hydroxide (ACS reagent grade) in 1,000 mL of deionized water. The solution was further diluted from 10 mL to 100 mL volumetrically to yield 0.01 N sodium hydroxide solution. Alternatively, commercial 0.01 N sodium hydroxide may also be used. Lead nitrate reagent (1 mg/mL) was prepared by accurately weighing 40±2 mg of lead nitrate (ACS reagent grade) and dissolving the lead nitrate in 25 mL of deionized water. Sodium sulfide standard (50 mg/L sulfide) was prepared by accurately weighing 37±2 mg of sodium sulfide into a 100-mL volumetric flask. The sulfide was dissolved and diluted to the volume with 0.01 N sodium hydroxide. For a sample, a 250 mg/mL solution in deionized water was prepared. Samples were tested singularly, in 10-mL test tubes or 4-mL glass vials with Teflon-lined caps. In parallel, test vials were prepared as shown in Table 4. TABLE 4 Deionized Sulfide Sample Label Water Test Sample Standard Pb(II) Reagent Blank 1.0 mL None 0.0 μL 100 Standard 1.0 mL None 50 μL 100 Sample None 1.0 mL 0.0 μL 100 Sample-Spike None 1.0 mL 50 μL 100 For quality control, the four test should meet the following requirements: i) the blank vial should be visibly clear and colorless; ii) the standard vial must have dark gray color or precipitate, clearly distinguishable from the blank; iii) the specificity solutions containing sulfate, sulfite, and chloride must have lighter gray color than the standard vial, and white precipitate is anticipated; and iv) the sulfide-spikes of specificity solutions containing sulfate, sulfite, and chloride must have darker gray color than the corresponding un-spiked solutions. b. Method Specificity The requirements for specificity were: i) the blank vial should be visibly clear and colorless; ii) the standard vial must have dark gray color or precipitate, clearly distinguishable from the blank; iii) the specificity solutions containing sulfate, sulfite, and chloride must have lighter gray color than the standard vial, and white precipitate is anticipated; and iv) the sulfide-spikes of specificity solutions containing sulfate, sulfite, and chloride must have darker gray color than the corresponding un-spiked solutions. All the requirements set forth in the protocol were met. Test solutions were prepared to contain 1 mg/mL individually, of sodium sulfate, sodium sulfite, and sodium chloride. Duplicate vials of these solutions were tested to evaluate potential interference. In addition, these test solutions were individually test with sulfide spiking, in order to evaluate interference to sulfide detection. The results are summarized in Table 5. The sulfide standard was prepared at a concentration of 50 mg/L sulfide, and lead nitrate reagent was prepared at a concentration of 1 g/L (Pb(II). The test solution color of gray or tan is accepted.

Limit of Detection As shown in Tables 6 and 7, the presence of sulfide in the blank (water) or in the drug product sample (sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate) was determined at 4 ppm and above with detection of tan color. According to the protocol, the limit of detection of sulfide in sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate drug product was determined to be 4 ppm. The limit of detection was determined to be 4 ppm, which was well below the limit (10 ppm).

The ion-exchange column was run at room temperature with suppressor current at 100 mA. For mobile phase preparation, a stock sodium carbonate solution (500 mM) was prepared by adding 26.5 g of sodium carbonate (ACS reagent grade) to a 500 mL volumetric flask, followed by the addition of deionized water to bring the volume to 500 mL at room temperature; and a stock sodium bicarbonate solution (500 mM) was prepared by adding 10.5 g of sodium bicarbonate (ACS reagent grade) to a 500 mL volumetric flask, followed by the addition of deionized water to bring the volume to 500 mL at room temperature A mobile phase was prepared by adding 54 mL stock sodium carbonate solution and 6 mL stock sodium bicarbonate solution to a 2 L volumetric flask, followed by the addition of deionized water to bring the volume to 2 L at room temperature. A stock sodium thiosulfate standard solution (1 g/L) was prepared by adding 0.10 g of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate to a 100 mL volumetric flask, followed by the addition of deionized water to bring the volume to 100 mL at room temperature. A sodium thiosulfate reference standard was prepared by adding 10.0 mL of the stock sodium thiosulfate solution to a 100 mL volumetric flask, followed by the addition of deionized water to bring the volume to 100 mL at room temperature. A linearity standard was prepared by diluting the sodium thiosulfate reference standard (12.5 mL) to 25.0 mL with deionized water. Thiosulfate-containing samples were prepared in duplicate. First, a stock sample solution was prepared by adding 2.0 mL of the sample to a 100 mL volumetric flask, followed by the addition of deionized water to bring the volume to 100 mL at room temperature. System suitability was determined by first injecting the sodium thiosulfate reference standard, followed by an injection of deionized water, to ensure no carryover that may interfere with the analysis. The sodium thiosulfate reference standard was then injected six times. The percent relative standard deviation (% RSD) of the peak area of thiosulfate was calculated. The first injection was used to calculate the tailing factor and number of theoretical plates according to Method 621 USP XXXII (2009). The % RSD of the peak area for the initial six injections of the thiosulfate peak must be NMT 2.0%. The tailing factor for the thiosulfate peak must be NMT 2.0. The number of theoretical plates (N) for the thiosulfate must be NLT 3,000. The area % RSD for the six injections plus each continuing calibration injections must be NMT 3.0%. The sodium thiosulfate reference standard was injected twice and the area difference (%) between the duplicate injections was determined. The % difference between the duplicate injections should be NMT 2.0% and the error of the assay value must be NMT 2.0%. The average area response thus determined was used to calculate the concentration of the previous six injections, and the difference in percentage of the concentration thus determined from the actual concentration was determined. The sample solution diluent was injected once to check carryover and other peaks arising from the diluent. The peak area response at the retention time of thiosulfate should be NMT 1% of the area response for the sodium thiosulfate reference standard. Linearity standard was injected twice. For the linearity standard, the average peak area must be between 47.0 and 53.0% of the average peak area for the system suitability injections. For the linearity standard, the % difference between the duplication injections must be NMT 2.0%. Each sample solution was injected in duplicate. The % difference between the duplicate was calculated. The % difference between in sodium thiosulfate assay concentrations between the duplicate preparations was also calculated. The instrument was verified every six sample injections and after the final sample injection by reanalyzing the sodium thiosulfate reference standard in duplicate. For each sample, the % difference between the duplication injections must be NMT 2.0%, and the % difference between the assay concentrations of thiosulfate in duplicate preparations must be NMT 2%. The concentration of a sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate sample was calculated based on its peak area in comparison with that of the sodium thiosulfate standard. Example 5 Determination of Trace Levels of Carbonate in Sodium Thiosulfate Pentahydrate All glassware was thoroughly rinsed with deionized water at least three times. Glassware used for weighing can be oven-dried, and extreme were taken when handling as not to contaminate the glassware with organic matter. Glassware used for dilution only was pre-rinsed at least three times with acidific reagent water, which was prepared by adding approximately 1 to 2 mL of concentrated phosphoric acid to 4,000 mL deionized water, followed by thoroughly rinsing with deionized water just prior to use. When weighing, a sterile plastic spatula was used instead of a metal spatula to reduce potential contamination. Sodium carbonate stock solution used for preparing carbonate standards was prepared by dissolving 0.177 g of sodium carbonate (ACS reagent grade) in 100.0 mL deionized water. Nominal concentration of carbonate is 1,000 mg/L, equivalent to 200 mg/L of carbon. A series of carbonate calibration standards was prepared by pipetting 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1,000 μL of sodium carbonate stock solution into separate 200 mL volumetric flasks, followed by adding deionized water to bring the volume to 200 mL at room temperature. Nominal concentrations are 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 5.0 mg/L of carbonate, respectively. Care was taken to make sure all carbonate solutions were tightly sealed and stored in a cool area away from excessive heat. Samples were prepared by weighing accurately to the nearest 0.01 mg and transferring an amount of the sample equivalent to less than 1.0 mg/L of carbon (5.0 mg/L carbonate) into a 100 mL volumetric flask. For a sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate drug substance with limit of carbonate at ≦0.01%, 1.00 g of the sample in 100 mL water would yield 1 mg/L of carbonate, equivalent to 0.2 mg/L carbon, when presented at 0.01%. Then, 20 mL of deionized was added to the 100 mL volumetric flask to dissolve the sample. The sample solution was titrated with 0.1 N iodine VS (approximately 40 mL) (cat. #318981, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) until a persistent yellow color is observed. Deionized water was added to bring the volume to 100 mL at room temperature. Total inorganic carbon, was determined using a Shimadzu TOC-V Analyzer in IC mode. In the IC mode, the sample was acidified in line with phosphoric acid to convert the inorganic carbon (carbonate and bicarbonate) to carbon dioxide, which was then routed to the non-dispersive infrared detector for quantitation. Only pre-cleaned TOC vials were used on the analyzer and each vial was filled completely with either standards or samples and left leave no head space in the vial. The vials were secured with caps. Under standard set-up, three measurements were made for each vial (standard, sample, or blank). Three measurements constituted a single run. Three rums of blank (deionized water) were performed to ensure that the analyzer was equilibrated and the results were consistent. One run of each calibration standards was performed. The % RSD and average area response from the three injections of each standard were determined. Linear regression of the average areas versus the standard concentrations was performed to determine the slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient for the calibration standards. Blank was included in the linear regression analysis, but no forcing through zero. One run was performed for each sample. The % RSD of the three injections and the average peak area was determined, from which the carbonate concentration was calculated based on the calibration standards. The analyzer was calibrated every six sample runs and after the final sample injection by performing one run of blank, followed by one run of the 2.0 mg/L calibration standard. The % RSD of both and carbonate recovery from the calibration standard curve were calculated. For quality control, the area (response) % RSD of the three injections for each standard must be no greater than (NMT) 10%. The calibration curve for carbonate must have a correlation coefficient of no less than (NLT) 0.995. The area % RSD of the initial blank and continuing calibration blank injections must be no greater than (NMT) 15%. The area % RSD for continuing calibration standard (2.0 mg/L) injections must be not more than (NMT) 10%. The % Recovery of the 2.0 mg/L continuing calibration standard must be 85% to 115%. The percent relative standard deviation (% RSD) is the standard deviation divided by the mean times 100.
