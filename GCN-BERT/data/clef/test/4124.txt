FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel cyclic amine derivative compounds, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use as medicaments, inter alia for the treatment or alleviation of Prostaglandin E mediated diseases such as acute and chronic pain, osteoarthritis, inflammation-associated disorder as arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, migraine and endometriosis. The cyclic amine derivative compounds of the invention are selective EP4 receptor antagonists. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A number of review articles describe the characterization and therapeutic relevance of the prostanoid receptors as well as the most commonly used selective agonists and antagonists; Eicosanoids: From Biotechnology to therapeutic Applications, Folco, Samuelson, Maclouf and Velo eds, Plenum Press, New York, 1996, chap. 14, 137-154; “Molecular aspects of the structures and functions of the prostaglandin E receptors”, Journal of Lipid Mediators and Cell Signalling, 1996, 14, 83-87; “Function of prostanoid receptors: studies on knockout mice”, Prostaglandins & other Lipid Mediators, 2002, 68-69, 557-573 and “Prostanoid receptor antagonists: development strategies and therapeutic applications”, British Journal of Pharmacology (2009), 158, 104-145. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a member of the prostanoid family with a variety of physiological effects, including mucosal protection, induction of gastric acid secretion in stomach, generation of fever, hyperalgesia, inflammation and immunity. These actions of prostaglandin PGE2 are mediated by four G-protein-coupled PGE2 receptors, EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4. The prostaglandin PGE2, in fact, has affinity for all of these EP receptors (SubTypes EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4, respectively). The EP4 receptor is a 7-transmembrane receptor whose activation is normally associated with elevation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. PGE2-activated EP4 receptor signalling may be involved in various pathologic states, such as pain (in particular inflammatory, neuropathic and visceral), inflammation, neuroprotection, cancer, dermatitis, bone disease, immune system dysfunction promotion of sleep, renal regulation, gastric or enteric mucus secretion and duodenal bicarbonate secretion. In The Journal of Immunology (2008, 181, 5082-5088) studies suggest that PGE2 inhibits proteoglycan synthesis and stimulates matrix degradation in osteoarthritic chondrocytes via the EP4 receptor. Targeting EP4, rather than cyclooxygenase 2, could represent a future strategy for osteoarthritis disease modification. In European Journal of Pharmacology (2008, 580, 116-121) studies suggest that that a pharmacological blockade of the prostanoid EP4 receptor may represent a new therapeutic strategy in signs and symptomatic relief of osteoarthritis and/or rheumatoid arthritis. Patent application publications WO2005021508, WO2005105732, WO2005105733, WO2007121578 and WO2009139373 disclose compounds as being useful in the treatment of prostaglandin mediated diseases.

Example 46 Determination of In Vitro Effects of the Invention Compounds Stable Expression of Human EP4 Receptors in the Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) Cell Line The cDNA clone of human EP4 receptor (NM—000958.2) was obtained from Invitrogen™: Ultimate™ ORF Clone Collection—Clone ID 10H46525. The coding sequence was subcloned in expression vector pcDNA™6.2/V5-DEST by Gateway technology (Invitrogen™). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were stably transfected with expression vector for human EP4 receptor in according to the method described in FuGENE®6 Transfection Reagent's manual (Roche Applied Science®). Preparation of Membrane Fraction: The EP4 transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml Blasticidin S HCl (selection medium) at 37° C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For the membrane preparation, cells in flask were harvested by hypotonical/mechanical lysis with chilled (4° C.) TE buffer (5 mM TRIS, 5 mM ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), pH 7.4). Cells were detached and lysed with 10 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer and by scraping. The cell lysate was vortexed for 30 sec and centrifuged at 40000×g at 4° C. for 22 min. a) Membrane Binding Assay[3H]-Prostaglandin E2 The membrane pellet was resuspended in the same buffer (5 mM TRIS, 5 mM ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), pH 7.4), and protein concentration was determined by Bradford method (Bio-Bad® assay). This membrane preparation was stored at −80° C. freezer until use for binding assay. ([3H]-PGE2) membranes binding assays toward hEP4 receptors (human EP4/HEK293 transfectant, see above) and hEP2 receptors (human EP2/HEK293 transfectant, purchased from PerkinElmer Inc) were performed in 10 mM MES-KOH buffer pH6, containing 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM CaCl2 for EP4 binding assay or 50 mM Tris-CI, BSA 0.5% for EP2 binding assay (according to supplier indication). Ten microgram of protein from membrane fractions were incubated in a total volume of 0.1 ml (EP4) or 0.2 ml (EP2) with 1 nM (EP4) or 3 nM (EP2) [3H]-PGE2 (PerkinElmer Inc, 171 Ci/mmol). In both assays to determine the total binding or non specific binding, 1% DMSO or 1 μM prostaglandin E2 (EP4) or 100 μM (EP2) were added to reaction mixtures, respectively. Incubation was conducted in a polypropylene 96 multiwell for 90 min (EP4) or 60 min (EP2) at room temperature prior to separation of the bound and free radioligand by vacuum manifold rapid filtration on glass fiber filters (Unifilter GFB96, PerkinElmer Inc) pre-soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. Filters were washed with ice cold buffer pH 7.4 (50 mM HEPES, NaCl 500 mM, BSA 0.1% for EP4 binding assay or 50 mM Tris-Cl for EP2 binding assays) and the residual [3H]-PGE2 binding determined by solid scintillation counter (TopCount, PerkinElmer Inc). In standard competition experiments the compounds were tested in a concentration range from 1 nM to 1 μM, and IC50 determined. The affinity (Ki) of each compound was calculated according to the Cheng-Prousoff equation: Ki=IC50/(1+([C]/Kd)). Results were expressed as pKi (−log 10 Ki (M) Compounds of example 1 to 45 were tested according to method of example 41a in a final concentration range from 1 nM to 1 μM. All compounds showed good to excellent EP4 affinities having pKi values from 6 to 8.9 at EP4 receptor. b) cAMP Assay on Human EP4 Membrane of Transfected Cells. The assay is based on the competition between endogenous cAMP and exogenously added biotinylated cAMP. The capture of cAMP is achieved by using a specific antibody conjugated to Donor beads. Cell membranes prepared as described above, were resuspended in 1 ml stimulation buffer (HBSS 1×+BSA 0.1%+IBMX 0.5 mM+HEPES 5 mM+MgCl2 10 mM+GTP 1 nM+GDP 10 μM+ATP 100 μM−pH 7.4). Cell membranes were dispensed into white 384-well microplates at final concentration of 1 μg/well and used for the determination of cAMP with the alphascreen cAMP functional assay (EnVision-PerkinElmer). Cell membrane/anti-cAMP Acceptor beads mix (5 μl) and a mixture of analysed compounds (dissolved in 100% DMSO to a final maximal concentration of 0.01% DMSO)/PGE2 (5 μl) were incubated at room temperature (22-23° C.) for 30 min in the dark. The Biotinylated-cAMP and donor beads (15 μl) were dispensed into each well to start the competition reaction. After 1 h incubation RT (22-23° C.) in the dark the plate was read using EnVision platform to determine the cAMP level (excitation: 680 nm; emission: 520,620 nm). In each experiment: cAMP standard curve (concentration range from 1×10−6 to 1×10−11 M in log intervals) with a negative control (no cAMP) a positive control: forskolin 10 μM Antagonism studies were performed stimulating HEK293 cell membrane with PGE2 3 nM. The AlphaScreen signal is plotted as a function of log concentration of cAMP and functional IC50 is determined. IC50 value is calculated by linear regression. Some compounds were tested according to method of example 41 b. All compounds showed good to excellent EP4 antagonism having functional IC50 values from 3 μM to 4 nM at EP4 receptor. The results of membrane binding assay and cAMP assay on human EP4 membrane of transfected cells selection of preferred compounds are summarised in table 1.

The rats were treated intravenously and orally (n=3 for each dose route) with compounds formulated as solutions. The rats were fitted with a jugular cannula for serial sampling. A full profile was acquired from each rat. Plasma extracts were quantitatively analyzed using a specific and sensitive LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method. Inter-individual variations between the three rats in each group were limited (CV for pharmacokinetic parameters was below 50%). After intravenous injection all compounds showed moderate volume of distribution (Vss) ranging between 400 and 2000 ml. A range of clearance values were obtained for the different structure, ranging from low to moderate values (from 43 to 250 ml/h). After oral administration, absorption was quite fast with a clear maximum concentration reached by the first sampling time-point of 15 minutes for all compounds. The absolute oral bioavailability was good for all compounds with F % around or in excess of 80%.
