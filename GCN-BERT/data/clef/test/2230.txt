CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Prov. Pat. App. 61/078,746 filed Jul. 7, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to catheter control systems for controlling the articulation of visualization and treatment apparatus having imaging and manipulation features for intravascularly accessing regions of the body. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Conventional devices for accessing and visualizing interior regions of a body lumen are known. For example, various catheter devices are typically advanced within a patient's body, e.g., intravascularly, and advanced into a desirable position within the body. Other conventional methods have utilized catheters or probes having position sensors deployed within the body lumen, such as the interior of a cardiac chamber. These types of positional sensors are typically used to determine the movement of a cardiac tissue surface or the electrical activity within the cardiac tissue. When a sufficient number of points have been sampled by the sensors, a “map” of the cardiac tissue may be generated. Another conventional device utilizes an inflatable balloon which is typically introduced intravascularly in a deflated state and then inflated against the tissue region to be examined. Imaging is typically accomplished by an optical fiber or other apparatus such as electronic chips for viewing the tissue through the membrane(s) of the inflated balloon. Moreover, the balloon must generally be inflated for imaging. Other conventional balloons utilize a cavity or depression formed at a distal end of the inflated balloon. This cavity or depression is pressed against the tissue to be examined and is flushed with a clear fluid to provide a clear pathway through the blood. However, many of the conventional catheter imaging systems lack the capability to provide therapeutic treatments or are difficult to manipulate in providing effective therapies. For instance, the treatment in a patient's heart for atrial fibrillation is generally made difficult by a number of factors, such as visualization of the target tissue, access to the target tissue, and instrument articulation and management, amongst others. Conventional catheter techniques and devices, for example such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,895,417; 5,941,845; and 6,129,724, used on the epicardial surface of the heart may be difficult in assuring a transmural lesion or complete blockage of electrical signals. In addition, current devices may have difficulty dealing with varying thickness of tissue through which a transmural lesion is desired. Conventional accompanying imaging devices, such as fluoroscopy, are unable to detect perpendicular electrode orientation, catheter movement during the cardiac cycle, and image catheter position throughout lesion formation. The absence of real-time visualization also poses the risk of incorrect placement and ablation of structures such as sinus node tissue which can lead to fatal consequences. Moreover, because of the tortuous nature of intravascular access, devices or mechanisms at the distal end of a catheter positioned within the patient's body, e.g., within a chamber of the heart, are typically no longer aligned with the handle. Steering or manipulation of the distal end of the catheter via control or articulation mechanisms on the handle is easily disorienting to the user as manipulation of a control on the handle in a first direction may articulate the catheter distal end in an unexpected direction depending upon the resulting catheter configuration leaving the user to adjust accordingly. However, this results in reduced efficiency and longer procedure times as well as increased risks to the patient. Accordingly, there is a need for improved catheter control systems which facilitate the manipulation and articulation of a catheter. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A tissue imaging and manipulation apparatus that may be utilized for procedures within a body lumen, such as the heart, in which visualization of the surrounding tissue is made difficult, if not impossible, by medium contained within the lumen such as blood, is described below. Generally, such a tissue imaging and manipulation apparatus comprises an optional delivery catheter or sheath through which a deployment catheter and imaging hood may be advanced for placement against or adjacent to the tissue to be imaged. The deployment catheter may define a fluid delivery lumen therethrough as well as an imaging lumen within which an optical imaging fiber or assembly may be disposed for imaging tissue. When deployed, the imaging hood may be expanded into any number of shapes, e.g., cylindrical, conical as shown, semi-spherical, etc., provided that an open area or field is defined by the imaging hood. The open area is the area within which the tissue region of interest may be imaged. The imaging hood may also define an atraumatic contact lip or edge for placement or abutment against the tissue region of interest. Moreover, the distal end of the deployment catheter or separate manipulatable catheters may be articulated through various controlling mechanisms such as push-pull wires manually or via computer control The deployment catheter may also be stabilized relative to the tissue surface through various methods. For instance, inflatable stabilizing balloons positioned along a length of the catheter may be utilized, or tissue engagement anchors may be passed through or along the deployment catheter for temporary engagement of the underlying tissue. In operation, after the imaging hood has been deployed, fluid may be pumped at a positive pressure through the fluid delivery lumen until the fluid fills the open area completely and displaces any blood from within the open area. The fluid may comprise any biocompatible fluid, e.g., saline, water, plasma, Fluorinert™, etc., which is sufficiently transparent to allow for relatively undistorted visualization through the fluid. The fluid may be pumped continuously or intermittently to allow for image capture by an optional processor which may be in communication with the assembly. In an exemplary variation for imaging tissue surfaces within a heart chamber containing blood, the tissue imaging and treatment system may generally comprise a catheter body having a lumen defined therethrough, a visualization element disposed adjacent the catheter body, the visualization element having a field of view, a transparent fluid source in fluid communication with the lumen, and a barrier or membrane extendable from the catheter body to localize, between the visualization element and the field of view, displacement of blood by transparent fluid that flows from the lumen, and an instrument translatable through the displaced blood for performing any number of treatments upon the tissue surface within the field of view. The imaging hood may be formed into any number of configurations and the imaging assembly may also be utilized with any number of therapeutic tools which may be deployed through the deployment catheter. More particularly in certain variations, the tissue visualization system may comprise components including the imaging hood, where the hood may further include a membrane having a main aperture and additional optional openings disposed over the distal end of the hood. An introducer sheath or the deployment catheter upon which the imaging hood is disposed may further comprise a steerable segment made of multiple adjacent links which are pivotably connected to one another and which may be articulated within a single plane or multiple planes. The deployment catheter itself may be comprised of a multiple lumen extrusion, such as a four-lumen catheter extrusion, which is reinforced with braided stainless steel fibers to provide structural support. The proximal end of the catheter may be coupled to a handle for manipulation and articulation of the system. To provide visualization, an imaging element such as a fiberscope or electronic imager such as a solid state camera, e.g., CCD or CMOS, may be mounted, e.g., on a shape memory wire, and positioned within or along the hood interior. A fluid reservoir and/or pump (e.g., syringe, pressurized intravenous bag, etc.) may be fluidly coupled to the proximal end of the catheter to hold the translucent fluid such as saline or contrast medium as well as for providing the pressure to inject the fluid into the imaging hood. One example of a system configured to enable direct visualization of tissue underlying the hood and optionally treat tissue, e.g., ablation, may include an ablation assembly, hood, and deployment catheter coupled to a handle having a catheter steering and locking assembly integrated along the handle. The catheter steering and locking assembly may include a steering member pivotably coupled to a locking member where the steering member may be coupled to one or more pullwires attached thereto via a retaining member, e.g., set screw, such that manipulation of the steering member articulates the steerable section and hood in a corresponding manner. The steering member may be pivotably coupled to the locking member along a point of rotation and locking mechanism which is attached to a steering plate. The catheter shaft contains at least one lumen which allows the passage of one or more pullwires that are connected to the steering member at the proximal end of the pullwire while the distal end may be terminated and anchored to the steering mechanisms along the steerable portion of the catheter. A compression coil, e.g., made of stainless steel, with a slightly larger diameter than the pullwire may be positioned about the pullwire within the handle to allow the pullwire to slide freely therethrough. In use, the steering member may be actuated, e.g., by pulling the member proximally, to articulate the steerable portion and hood in the same direction of articulation. With the steerable portion articulated to the degree desired to position the hood, the locking member may be actuated to maintain a configuration of the steerable portion and hood by preventing or inhibiting movement of the steering member thus freeing the hand or hands of the user. A steering indicator and/or locking indicator may be optionally incorporated along the handle as a reminder to the user. The handle assembly may also optionally incorporate an optical adjustment assembly which may be used to move the distal lens of a visualization instrument, such as a fiberscope, distally or proximally from the imaged tissue region, hence simulating a zoom-in and/or zoom-out optical effect. Generally, the optical adjustment assembly is able to provide zoom-in and/or zoom-out capabilities by varying the length of the assembly. By rotating an adjustment member, which is coupled to a retaining sleeve within the optical adjustment assembly, a distal shaft portion may be advanced or retracted relative to the guide shaft. The assembly may be accordingly varied in length while distally or proximally advancing the fiberscope based on the varied length of the optical adjustment assembly to control the visualized field of view. Because manipulation of the hood and steerable portion corresponds with an angle at which the handle is positioned, the handle may also serve as an orientation indicator for the hood and steerable portion once the hood has been introduced into the patient's body. This correspondence between the planes of the handle and the resulting articulation of the hood and steerable-portion may be particularly useful for efficiently controlling the hood position within the patient's body. As the catheter is usually repeatedly torqued during a procedure, keeping track of the orientation of the deflection of the hood can be difficult, if not impossible, unless fluoroscopy is used. With the handle, the angle of deflection of the hood can be predicted by the operator without the need of fluoroscopy. This is can be particularly desirable in procedures such as transseptal punctures where an accurate angle of puncture of the septal wall is desirable to avoid complications such as perforation of the aorta. Another variation of a steering handle assembly may include an assembly having a handle portion and a steering ring which may be manipulated along any number of directions relative to the housing to control the articulation of the hood. Manipulating or pulling along a portion of the steering ring causes the steerable portion and hood to move along a corresponding direction of articulation. Moreover, because of the manner in which the steering ring is positioned to encircle the handle assembly, the operator may grip the handle along any orientation and operate the handle assembly with a single hand. The handle assembly may generally comprise a ball pivot supported by pivot support enclosed within the housing. The ball pivot may support the steering ring via one or more steering ring support members, e.g., four steering ring support members, which extend radially through corresponding support member openings. Because of the ball pivot shape, the steering ring may be moved about the pivot in any number of directions. The terminal ends of one or more pullwires may be coupled the steering ring via corresponding fasteners, e.g., set screws, securing each of the pullwire termination crimps. These pullwires may extend through the pivot support housing and through a pullwire transition manifold and into a proximal end of a multi-lumen shaft, such as the catheter. The pullwires may continue distally through the catheter where they are coupled to the steerable portion of the catheter. Each of the pullwires may be optionally encased in corresponding compression coils between the transition manifold and catheter. Although multiple pullwires may be utilized depending upon the number of directions for articulation, four pullwires may be typically utilized. Each of the four pullwires may be terminated symmetrically around a circumference of the steering ring such that a balanced four-way steering of the distal portion may be accomplished, although manipulating the steering ring along various portions of its circumference may yield combinational articulation between the pullwires to result in numerous catheter configurations. Additionally, the handle assembly may further incorporate a spring mechanism as an overdrive prevention mechanism positioned between the transition manifold and ball pivot in order to prevent over-tensioning or breaking of the pullwires if the steering ring is over-deflected in a direction. The handle assembly and catheter can be consistently deflected in the same direction by which the steering ring is being deflected regardless of the orientation of the handle assembly. For example, the handle assembly may be deflected in a first direction of actuation such that the hood is deflected in a corresponding first direction of articulation. If the handle assembly, catheter, and hood are then rotated along an arbitrary direction of rotation about the longitudinal axis of the assembly, even with the entire assembly rotated, e.g., 180°, actuating the steering ring along the first direction of actuation still results in a corresponding first direction of articulation of the hood which matches the initial direction of articulation despite the rotated assembly. In yet another variation of the catheter control handle, the control assembly may be configured to articulate at least two independently deflectable portions. As with previous variations, a steering ring may encircle the housing. However, this variation further includes a proximal handle portion extending from the housing with a proximal section control for articulating the proximal steerable section. Moreover, this particular handle assembly may be used to control articulation of the hood and the distal steerable section but also used to further control articulation of the proximal steerable section. A proximal section control located along the proximal handle portion may be actuated, e.g., by rotating the control in a first and/or second direction, to articulate the proximal steerable section within a first plane and the hood may be further articulated by manipulating the steering ring such that distal steerable section moves in a corresponding direction of articulation. Additionally and/or alternatively, visual indicators positioned directly upon the hood may also be utilized in coordination with corresponding visual indicators positioned upon the handle itself. The hood may have one or more visual indicators marked upon the distal portion of the hood such that the visual image through the hood may show at least a first directional indicator along a first portion of the hood. The handle assembly may thus have one or more directional indicators located directly upon, e.g., the steering ring, which correspond spatially with the indicators positioned upon the hood or hood membrane. The catheter control systems described herein may additionally integrate any number of features and controls for facilitate procedures. These features and controls may be integrated into any of the variations described herein. One example may include features such as flow rate control, air bubble detection, ablation activation switches, built-in image sensors, etc., may be incorporated into the handle assembly.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A tissue-imaging and manipulation apparatus described herein is able to provide real-time images in vivo of tissue regions within a body lumen such as a heart, which is filled with blood flowing dynamically therethrough and is also able to provide intravascular tools and installments for performing various procedures upon the imaged tissue regions. Such an apparatus may be utilized for many procedures, e.g., facilitating transseptal access to the left atrium, cannulating the coronary sinus, diagnosis of valve regurgitation/stenosis, valvuloplasty, atrial appendage closure, arrhythmogenic focus ablation, among other procedures. One variation of a tissue access and imaging apparatus is shown in the detail perspective views of FIGS. 1A to 1C. As shown in FIG. 1A, tissue imaging and manipulation assembly 10 may be delivered intravascularly through the patient's body in a low-profile configuration via a delivery catheter or sheath 14. In the case of treating tissue, it is generally desirable to enter or access the left atrium while minimizing trauma to the patient. To non-operatively effect such access, one conventional approach involves puncturing the intra-atrial septum from the right atrial chamber to the left atrial chamber in a procedure commonly called a transseptal procedure or septostomy. For procedures such as percutaneous valve repair and replacement, transseptal access to the left atrial chamber of the heart may allow for larger devices to be introduced into the venous system than can generally be introduced percutaneously into the arterial system. When the imaging and manipulation assembly 10 is ready to be utilized for imaging tissue, imaging hood 12 may be advanced relative to catheter 14 and deployed from a distal opening of catheter 14, as shown by the arrow. Upon deployment, imaging hood 12 may be unconstrained to expand or open into a deployed imaging configuration, as shown in FIG. 1B. Imaging hood 12 may be fabricated from a variety of pliable or conformable biocompatible material including but not limited to, e.g., polymeric, plastic, or woven materials. One example of a woven material is Kevlar® (E. I. du Pont de Nemours, Wilmington, Del.), which is an aramid and which can be made into thin, e.g., less than 0.001 in., materials which maintain enough integrity for such applications described herein. Moreover, the imaging hood 12 may be fabricated from a translucent or opaque material and in a variety of different colors to optimize or attenuate any reflected lighting from surrounding fluids or structures, i.e., anatomical or mechanical structures or instruments. In either case, imaging hood 12 may be fabricated into a uniform structure or a scaffold-supported structure, in which case a scaffold made of a shape memory alloy, such as Nitinol, or a spring steel, or plastic, etc., may be fabricated and covered with the polymeric, plastic, or woven material. Hence, imaging hood 12 may comprise any of a wide variety of barriers or membrane structures, as may generally be used to localize displacement of blood or the like from a selected volume of a body lumen or heart chamber. In exemplary embodiments, a volume within an inner surface 13 of imaging hood 12 will be significantly less than a volume of the hood 12 between inner surface 13 and outer surface 11. Imaging hood 12 may be attached at interface 24 to a deployment catheter 16 which may be translated independently of deployment catheter or sheath 14. Attachment of interface 24 may be accomplished through any number of conventional methods. Deployment catheter 16 may define a fluid delivery lumen 18 as well as an imaging lumen 20 within which an optical imaging fiber or assembly may be disposed for imaging tissue. When deployed, imaging hood 12 may expand into any number of shapes, e.g., cylindrical, conical as shown, semi-spherical, etc., provided that an open area or field 26 is defined by imaging hood 12. The open area 26 is the area within which the tissue region of interest may be imaged. Imaging hood 12 may also define an atraumatic contact lip or edge 22 for placement or abutment against the tissue region of interest. Moreover, the diameter of imaging hood 12 at its maximum fully deployed diameter, e.g., at contact lip or edge 22, is typically greater relative to a diameter of the deployment catheter 16 (although a diameter of contact lip or edge 22 may be made to have a smaller or equal diameter of deployment catheter 16). For instance, the contact edge diameter may range anywhere from 1 to 5 times (or even greater, as practicable) a diameter of deployment catheter 16. FIG. 1C shows an end view of the imaging hood 12 in its deployed configuration. Also shown are the contact lip or edge 22 and fluid delivery lumen 18 and imaging lumen 20. As seen in the example of FIGS. 2A and 2D, deployment catheter 16 may be manipulated to position deployed imaging hood 12 against or near the underlying tissue region of interest to be imaged, in this example a portion of annulus A of mitral valve MV within the left atrial chamber. As the surrounding blood 30 flows around imaging hood 12 and within open area 26 defined within imaging hood 12, as seen in FIG. 2A, the underlying annulus A is obstructed by the opaque blood 30 and is difficult to view through the imaging lumen 20. The translucent fluid 28, such as saline, may then be pumped through fluid delivery lumen 18, intermittently or continuously, until the blood 30 is at least partially, and preferably completely, displaced from within open area 26 by fluid 28, as shown in FIG. 2B. Although contact edge 22 need not directly contact the underlying tissue, it is at least preferably brought into close proximity to the tissue such that the flow of clear fluid 28 from open area 26 may be maintained to inhibit significant backflow of blood 30 back into open area 26. Contact edge 22 may also be made of a soft elastomeric material such as certain soft grades of silicone or polyurethane, as typically known, to help contact edge 22 conform to an uneven or rough underlying anatomical tissue surface. Once the blood 30 has been displaced from imaging hood 12, an image may then be viewed of the underlying tissue through the clear fluid 30. This image may then be recorded or available for real-time viewing for performing a therapeutic procedure. The positive flow of fluid 28 may be maintained continuously to provide for clear viewing of the underlying tissue. Alternatively, the fluid 28 may be pumped temporarily or sporadically only until a clear view of the tissue is available to be imaged and recorded, at which point the fluid flow 28 may cease and blood 30 may be allowed to seep or flow back into imaging hood 12. This process may be repeated a number of times at the same tissue region or at multiple tissue regions. FIG. 3A shows a partial cross-sectional view of an example where one or more optical fiber bundles 32 may be positioned within the catheter and within imaging hood 12 to provide direct in-line imaging of the open area within hood 12. FIG. 3B shows another example where an imaging element 34 (e.g., CCD or CMOS electronic imager) may be placed along an interior surface of imaging hood 12 to provide imaging of the open area such that the imaging element 34 is off-axis relative to a longitudinal axis of the hood 12, as described in further detail below. The off-axis position of element 34 may provide for direct visualization and uninhibited access by instruments from the catheter to the underlying tissue during treatment. In utilizing the imaging hood 12 in any one of the procedures described herein, the hood 12 may have an open field which is uncovered and clear to provide direct tissue contact between the hood interior and the underlying tissue to effect any number of treatments upon the tissue, as described above. Yet in additional variations, imaging hood 12 may utilize other configurations. An additional variation of the imaging hood 12 is shown in the perspective and end views, respectively, of FIGS. 4A and 4B, where imaging hood 12 includes at least one layer of a transparent elastomeric membrane 40 over the distal opening of hood 12. An aperture 42 having a diameter which is less than a diameter of the outer lip of imaging hood 12 may be defined over the center of membrane 40 where a longitudinal axis of the hood intersects the membrane such that the interior of hood 12 remains open and in fluid communication with the environment external to hood 12. Furthermore, aperture 42 may be sized, e.g., between 1 to 2 mm or more in diameter and membrane 40 can be made from any number of transparent elastomers such as silicone, polyurethane, latex, etc. such that contacted tissue may also be visualized through membrane 40 as well as through aperture 42. Aperture 42 may function generally as a restricting passageway to reduce the rate of fluid out-flow from the hood 12 when the interior of the hood 12 is infused with the clear fluid through which underlying tissue regions may be visualized. Aside from restricting out-flow of clear fluid from within hood 12, aperture 42 may also restrict external surrounding fluids from entering hood 12 too rapidly. The reduction in the rate of fluid out-flow from the hood and blood in-flow into the hood may improve visualization conditions as hood 12 may be more readily filled with transparent fluid rather than being filled by opaque blood which may obstruct direct visualization by the visualization installments. Moreover, aperture 42 may be aligned with catheter 16 such that any installments (e.g., piercing instruments, guidewires, tissue engagers, etc.) that are advanced into the hood interior may directly access the underlying tissue uninhibited or unrestricted for treatment through aperture 42. In other variations wherein aperture 42 may not be aligned with catheter 16, installments passed through catheter 16 may still access the underlying tissue by simply piercing through membrane 40. In an additional variation, FIGS. 5A and 5B show perspective and end views, respectively, of imaging hood 12 which includes membrane 40 with aperture 42 defined therethrough, as described above. This variation includes a plurality of additional openings 44 defined over membrane 40 surrounding aperture 42. Additional openings 44 may be uniformly sized, e.g., each less than 1 mm in diameter, to allow for the out-flow of the translucent fluid therethrough when in contact against the tissue surface. Moreover, although openings 44 are illustrated as uniform in size, the openings may be varied in size and their placement may also be non-uniform or random over membrane 40 rather than uniformly positioned about aperture 42 in FIG. 5B. Furthermore, there are eight openings 44 shown in the figures although fewer than eight or more than eight openings 44 may also be utilized over membrane 40. Additional details of tissue imaging and manipulation systems and methods which may be utilized with apparatus and methods described herein are further described, for example, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/259,498 filed Oct. 25, 2005 (U.S. Pat. Pub. 2006/0184048 A1), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In utilizing the devices and methods above, various procedures may be accomplished. One example of such a procedure is crossing a tissue region such as in a transseptal procedure where a septal wall is pierced and traversed, e.g., crossing from a right atrial chamber to a left atrial chamber in a heart of a subject. Generally, in piercing and traversing a septal wall, the visualization and treatment devices described herein may be utilized for visualizing the tissue region to be pierced as well as monitoring the piercing and access through the tissue. Details of transseptal visualization catheters and methods for transseptal access which may be utilized with the apparatus and methods described herein are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/763,399 filed Jun. 14, 2007 (U.S. Pat. Pub. 2007/0293724 A1), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Additionally, details of tissue visualization and manipulation catheter which may be utilized with apparatus and methods described herein are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/259,498 filed Oct. 25, 2005 (U.S. Pat. Pub. 2006/0184048 A1), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIG. 6 illustrates one example of a system configured to enable direct visualization of tissue underlying hood 12 and optionally tissue treatment, e.g., ablation. As shown in ablation assembly 50, hood 12 and deployment catheter 16 are coupled to handle 52, as previously described. Fluid reservoir 56, shown in this example as a saline-filled bag reservoir, may be attached through handle 52 to provide the clearing fluid and/or ablation medium. An optional access cannula 54 is also illustrated attached to handle 52 and may be used in one variation as an access lumen for flushing or clearing a working channel through handle 52 and catheter 16 where such a working channel may be used to introduce and advance any number of instruments for tissue treatment, e.g., an access needle which may be advanced into handle 52 and into or through hood 12. An optical imaging assembly 58 coupled to an imaging element positioned within or adjacent to hood 12 may extend proximally through handle 52 and be coupled to imaging processor assembly 60 (which may also optionally include a light source) for processing the images detected within hood 12. Assembly may also be coupled to a video receiving assembly 62 for receiving images from the optical imaging assembly 58. The video receiving assembly 62 may in turn be coupled to video processor assembly 64 which may process the detected images within hood 12 for display upon video display 68. FIGS. 7A and 7B show a side view of a variation of the catheter control handle assembly and a detail side view of the handle 52 having a catheter steering and locking assembly 70 integrated along the handle 52. As shown, handle 52 may have several access channels defined through which allow for communication for any number of instruments into and/or through the catheter 16 and hood 12. For instance, a fluid catheter 86 may be positioned at least partially through fluid channel 88 within handle 52. The optical imaging assembly 58, e.g., a fiberscope or CCD or CMOS imaging assembly, maybe positioned through support shaft 94 and support shaft interface 96 which enters handle 52. In the case where a fiberscope is utilized, the fiberscope shaft 82 may be passed through an optional optical adjustment assembly 84, as described in further detail below. Another working channel 80 may be further defined through handle 52 to allow for entry and passage of yet another instrument, e.g., a piercing needle, ablation probe, etc. Also shown is catheter steering and locking assembly 70 integrated along the handle 52 having a steering member 72 pivotably coupled to a locking member 74. Steering member 72 may be coupled to one or more pullwires 78 attached thereto via retaining member 92, e.g., set screw, such that manipulation of the steering member articulates the steerable section and hood in a corresponding manner. Steering member 72 may be pivotably coupled to locking member 74 along a point of rotation and locking mechanism 76 which is attached to a steering plate 90. The catheter shaft contains at least one lumen which allows the passage of one or more pullwires that are connected to the steering member 72 at the proximal end of the pullwire while the distal end may be terminated and anchored to the steering mechanisms along the steerable portion 100 of the catheter 16. Details of steering mechanisms and steerable sections of the visualization catheter, which may be utilized with apparatus and methods described herein are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/108,812 filed Apr. 24, 2008 and Ser. No. 12/117,655 filed May 8, 2008, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The one or more pullwires can be made from metal such as stainless steel or nitinol. A compression coil, e.g., made of stainless steel, with a slightly larger diameter than the pullwire may be positioned about the pullwire within the handle 52 to allow the pullwire to slide freely therethrough. The ends of the compression coil may be glue jointed to the proximal end to the catheter body and the distal end to the side wall of the shaft. Alternatively, the pullwire may be passed through a hypo tube made of stainless steel and be anchored at the distal side wall of the catheter 16. In use, steering member 72 may be actuated, e.g., by pulling the member proximally, to articulate the steerable portion 100 and hood 12 in the same direction of articulation 102, as shown in the side view of FIG. 8A. With the steerable portion 100 articulated to the degree desired to position hood 12, locking member 74 may be actuated, e.g., in the direction of locking 104, to maintain a configuration of steerable portion 100 and hood 12 by preventing or inhibiting movement of steering member 72, as shown in the side view of FIG. 8B, thus freeing the hand or hands of the user. A steering indicator 106 and/or locking indicator 108 may be optionally incorporated along handle 52 as a reminder to the user. FIG. 9 illustrates a perspective view of an exploded steering and locking assembly. As shown, the locking member 74 may define an opening 112 which is keyed to locking mechanism 76, e.g., lock hex nut, such that the locking mechanism 76 rotates when locking member 74 is rotated. Locking mechanism 76 may also pass through an opening 114 defined along the steering member 72 as well as through an opening 116 defined through the steering plate 90 such that a terminal end of the locking mechanism 76 is coupled to lock bolt 118. Once the one or more pullwires, which may be secured within pullwire passage 120 defined through the steering member 72 by set screw 92, is pulled to a desired degree by steering member 72, locking member 74 may be rotated about axis of rotation 110 to drive locking mechanism 76 into the lock bolt 118 to compress the steering member 72 between the steering plate 90 and the locking member 74. Hence, steering member 72 is locked in its current position when locking member 74 is applied thereby holding the steerable section in its desired configuration. As previously mentioned, the handle assembly may also optionally incorporate an optical adjustment assembly 84, as shown in the perspective exploded assembly view of FIG. 10A. The optical adjustment assembly 84 may be used to move the distal lens of a visualization instrument, such as a fiberscope, distally or proximally from the imaged tissue region, hence simulating a zoom-in and/or zoom-out optical effect. Generally, the optical adjustment assembly 84 is able to provide zoom-in and/or zoom-out capabilities by varying the length of the assembly. As depicted in the cross-sectional side views of FIGS. 10B and IOC, an adjustment member 130 houses guide shaft 134 which extends proximally through receiving channel 132 of adjustment member 130 and is retained within by a retaining lip 136. The proximally extending sliding shaft portion 144 of a second shaft is positioned slidably within guide shaft 134 while the distally extending distal shaft portion 142 of this second shaft is positioned within a sleeve opening 152 of retaining sleeve 150, which is also positioned within adjustment member 130. This second shaft further comprises a threaded guide 146 along a portion of its outer surface which is configured to engage rotatably with the inner surface of sleeve opening 152, which is also threaded in a complementary manner. With the shafts assembled, one or more fasteners 158, e.g., set screw, may be used to secure adjustment member 130 to retaining sleeve 150 through fastener opening 156 defined through member 130 and fastener interface 154 defined along retaining sleeve 150. Distally extending distal shaft portion 142 may further define connector interface 148 for coupling to a retaining luer connector 160 while guide shaft 134 may also define a connector interface 138 for coupling to a luer connector 140. In use, the shaft of a visualization instrument such as a fiberscope may be positioned through and secured to the assembly 84 by one or more of the connectors, e.g., luer connector 160. By rotating adjustment member 130, which is coupled to retaining sleeve 150, distal shaft portion 142 may be advanced or retracted relative to guide shaft 134 via the threaded engagement between threaded guide 146 and sleeve opening 152. The assembly 84 may be accordingly varied in length while distally or proximally advancing the fiberscope based on the varied length of the optical adjustment assembly 84 to control the visualized field of view. Also previously mentioned above, the optical imaging assembly 58 may be optionally positioned through a support shaft 94 and support shaft interface 96 which enters handle 52, as shown in the perspective view of FIG. 11. Support shaft 94 may be longitudinally reinforced to protect the optical fiber used by the visualization catheter from buckling or breaking. To maintain a position of shaft 94 relative to the handle into which the shaft 94 extends, shaft 94 may incorporate a strain relief wire 162 which protrudes from the distal end of shaft 94 at an angle for temporarily locking within a wire channel 164, as shown above in FIG. 7B. Once wire 162 has been engaged within channel 164 within the handle, shaft 94 may provide stability to the fiberscope shaft. The wire 162 can be made from stainless steel or nitinol and have a thickness between, e.g., 0.050″ to 0.100″. Because manipulation of the hood 12 and steerable portion corresponds with an angle at which the handle is positioned, handle 52 may also serve as an orientation indicator for the hood 12 and steerable portion once the hood 12 has been introduced into the patient's body. As shown in the side view of FIG. 12, the handle 52 may define a plane A. Articulation of hood 12 and the steerable portion may thus also define a plane A′ which corresponds planarly to the plane A defined by the handle 52. This correspondence between the planes A, A′ of the handle 52 and the resulting articulation of the hood 12 and steerable portion may be particularly useful for efficiently controlling the hood position within the patient's body. As the catheter 16 is usually repeatedly torqued during a procedure, keeping track of the orientation of the deflection of the hood 12 can be difficult, if not impossible, unless fluoroscopy is used. With the handle 52, the angle of deflection of the hood 12 can be predicted by the operator without the need of fluoroscopy. This is can be particularly desirable in procedures such as transseptal punctures where an accurate angle of puncture of the septal wall is desirable to avoid complications such as perforation of the aorta. An example of how this feature may be utilized is shown in the illustrations of FIGS. 13A and 13B, which show a hood positioned within the right atrium of a heart H while coupled to handle 52 positioned external to the body. Handle 52 may be seen as being positioned along plane A while hood 12 and the distal portion of catheter 16 is positioned within corresponding plane A′. As handle 52 is rotated, e.g., at 90°, about its longitudinal axis in a direction of rotation 170 such that handle 52 then lies within a different plane B, hood 12 and the distal steerable portion may also rotate, e.g., at 90°, within the right atrium in a corresponding direction of rotation 170′ such that the hood and catheter then define a corresponding different plane B′. Thus, by merely articulating the handle 52 external to the body in a specified direction, the user may adjust or desirably position or re-position the hood within the body in a known direction without having to utilize additional catheter positioning mechanisms. FIG. 14 shows an assembly view of another variation of a steering handle assembly 180 which enables a user to steer the visualization hood 12 along at least four or more degrees of freedom relative to a longitudinal axis of the catheter 16. FIG. 15 shows a side view of the handle assembly 180 illustrating handle portion 182 and steering ring 184 which may be manipulated along any number of directions relative to housing 186 to control the articulation of the hood 12. As shown in FIG. 16, manipulating or pulling along a portion of steering ring 184, e.g., along a direction of actuation 192, causes steerable portion 100 and hood 12 to move along a corresponding direction of articulation 194. Moreover, because of die manner in which steering ring 184 is positioned to encircle the handle assembly 180, the operator may grip the handle 180 along any orientation and operate the handle assembly 180 with a single hand 190. For instance, the operator may manipulate the steering ring with the thumb and/or index finger while insertion length of the catheter 16 can also be simultaneously controlled by the same hand 190 by pulling or pushing the handle assembly 180 to translate the entire catheter 16. As shown in the cross-sectional side views of FIGS. 17A and 17B, handle assembly 180 may generally comprise a ball pivot 200 supported by pivot support 202 enclosed within housing 186. Ball pivot 200 may support the steering ring 184 via one or more steering ring support members 204, 206, e.g., four steering ring support members, which extend radially through corresponding support member openings 208, 210. Because of the ball pivot 200 shape, steering ring 184 may be moved about pivot 200 in any number of directions. The terminal ends of one or more pullwires 220, 222 may be coupled steering ring 184 via corresponding fasteners 212, 214, e.g., set screws, securing each of the pullwire termination crimps 216, 218. These pullwires 220, 222 may extend through pivot support housing 224 which defines receiving channel 226, which supports pivot support 202, and through pullwire transition manifold 228 and into a proximal end of a multi-lumen shaft 234, such as catheter 16. The pullwires may continue distally through catheter 16 where they are coupled to the steerable portion of catheter 16. Each of the pullwires may be optionally encased in corresponding compression coils 230, 232 between the transition manifold 228 and catheter. Although multiple pullwires may be utilized depending upon the number of directions for articulation, four pullwires may be typically utilized. Each of the four pullwires may be terminated symmetrically around a circumference of steering ring 184 such that a balanced four-way steering of the distal portion may be accomplished, although manipulating the steering ring 184 along various portions of its circumference may yield combinational articulation between the pullwires to result in numerous catheter configurations. Additionally, the handle assembly may further incorporate a spring mechanism 236 as an overdrive prevention mechanism, as shown in FIG. 17B. Spring mechanism 236 may be positioned between the transition manifold 228 and ball pivot 200 in order to prevent over-tensioning or breaking of the pullwires if the steering ring 184 is over-deflected in a direction. FIGS. 18A to 18C illustrate side views of the handle assembly 180 and catheter 16 to show how the hood 12 can be consistently deflected in the same direction by which the steering ring 184 is being deflected regardless of the orientation of the handle assembly 180. For example, handle assembly 180 may be deflected in a direction of actuation 240 such that hood 12 is deflected in a corresponding direction of articulation 242. A first side indicator X of handle 180 and a second opposing side indicator Y of handle 180 are shown to indicate a first position of handle 180 and the corresponding first side indicator X′ of hood 12 and corresponding second opposing side indicator Y′ of hood 12 are likewise shown to indicate a first position of hood 12. The handle assembly 180, catheter 16, and hood 12 are then rotated along an arbitrary direction of rotation 244 about longitudinal axis 246 of the assembly such that the handle positional indicators X, Y and the hood positional indicators X′, Y′ are now positioned in opposite locations. Even with the entire assembly rotated, e.g., 180°, actuating the steering ring 184 along the direction of actuation 248 still results in a corresponding direction of articulation 250 of hood 12 which matches the initial direction of articulation 242 despite the rotated assembly. Regardless of the angle by which the operator subsequently rotates the catheter 16 about the longitudinal axis 246, the operator can still be certain that deflecting the steering ring 184 in a particular direction will steer the distal end of the catheter in the same direction. This removes the need for the operator to memorize the original position of the catheter or how much the catheter has been torqued in order to gauge the orientation of the deflected end when the catheter is inserted into the patient. In yet another variation of the catheter control handle, FIG. 19 shows an assembly view of steering handle assembly 260 which is configured to articulate a catheter 16 having at least two independently deflectable portions, e.g., a proximal steerable section 262 adapted to articulate within a single plane relative to a longitudinal axis of the catheter and a distal steerable section 264 adapted to articulate within one or more planes relative to a longitudinal axis of the proximal steerable section 262. Utilizing such catheter steering may be particularly advantageous for tissue treatment, e.g., ablation, in the left atrium of the heart as such adaptability in steering may impart additional accuracy and efficiency to steer the imaging and ablation hood 12 around complex anatomical structures, such as the pulmonary vein ostium. Examples of such steerable catheters are shown and described in further detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/108,812 filed Apr. 24, 2008 (U.S. Pat. Pub. 2008/0275300 A1) and Ser. No. 12/117,655 filed May 8, 2008 (U.S. Pat. Pub. 2008/0281293 A1), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Moreover, this handle variation as well as any of the other handle variations herein may incorporate any of the features described in each of the variations, as practicable. For instance, this particular variation may also utilize the optical adjustment assembly, locking mechanisms, etc. in combination if so desired. FIGS. 20A and 20B show side views of the steering handle assembly 260 with the catheter 16 having proximal steerable section 262 and distal steerable section 264 extending from distal handle portion 274. As with previous variations, a steering ring 270 may encircle housing 272. However, this variation further includes a proximal handle portion 276 extending from housing 272 with a proximal section control 278 for articulating proximal steerable section 262. FIGS. 21A and 21B show end views of the control handle 260 from the perspective of the catheter shaft 16 and from the handle end, respectively. As shown, steering ring 270 may be supported by a number of steering ring support members 280, 282, 284, 286 which extend from housing 272 through corresponding support member openings 288, 290, 282, 294. FIGS. 22A and 22B show additional perspective assembly and detail views, respectively, of the visualization assembly and steering handle assembly 260. As previously described for other variations, this particular handle assembly 260 may be used to control articulation of the hood 12 and the distal steerable section 264 but also used to further control articulation of the proximal steerable section 262. As shown in the perspective view of FIG. 23A, proximal section control 278 may be actuated, e.g., by rotating the control 278 in a first direction 300, to articulate the proximal steerable section 262 within a first plane, e.g., to retroflex hood 12 and distal steerable section 264 in a corresponding direction of articulation 302. Hood 12 may be further articulated by manipulating steering ring 270, e.g., in a direction of actuation 304, such that distal steerable section 264 moves in a corresponding direction of articulation 306, as shown in FIG. 23B. In one variation, proximal steerable section 262 may be configured to articulate via proximal section control 278 within a single plane while distal steerable section 264 may be configured to articulate in at least four directions, as above. However, both the proximal section control 278 and the steering ring 270 can be manipulated in varying degrees to steer the respective steerable sections to varying curvatures as desired by the operator. FIG. 24 shows a perspective exploded assembly view of the handle assembly 260 while FIG. 25 shows a cross-sectional side view of the same handle assembled. As shown, a ball pivot 310 having a pivot support 312 may be supported within a proximal portion of distal handle portion 274. One or more steering ring support members 314 may extend through respective openings defined through housing 272 to support the circumferentially encircling steering ring 270. As above, a pullwire transition manifold 316 may be positioned proximal to the catheter 16 entrance. A guide shaft 322 may be positioned at least partially through proximal handle portion 276 while maintained in position by retaining lip 324. A sliding shaft portion 328 may be positioned slidably within guide shaft 322 while a distal shaft portion 326 may extend distally through housing 272. A pullwire retaining member 318 haying a pullwire termination crimp 320 may be positioned along a distal end of distal shaft portion 326 such that as distal shaft portion 326 is translated distally and/or proximally according to the manipulation of section control 278, the pullwire for the proximal steerable section 262 may be accordingly pulled or pushed. The distal shaft portion 326 may further have a threaded guide 330 which is engaged to a threaded inner surface of retaining sleeve 332, which is secured to section control 278. Thus, as control 278 is rotated, retaining sleeve 332 is also rotated thereby urging distal shaft portion 326 and sliding shaft portion 328 to move accordingly via the engagement with threaded guide 330. A further access lumen 334 is illustrated as extending through the handle assembly 260. As further illustrated in the cross-sectional side view of FIG. 26, the one or more proximal steerable section pullwire 342 is shown as extending from catheter 16 and extending through transition manifold 316 and terminated at pullwire retaining member 318. Additionally, one or more distal steerable section pullwires 338, 340 are also shown to emerge from catheter 16, through one or more corresponding compression coils 336, and through transition manifold 316 to terminate at corresponding pullwire termination crimps 348, 350, which may be secured to steering ring 270 via fasteners 344, 346, e.g., set screws. The distal ends these pullwires, e.g., at least four pullwires, can be anchored to the inner walls of the distal steerable section 264. At both the proximal as well as the distal ends, the pullwires may be separated, e.g., by 90°, such that the four-way steerable section is able to be steered symmetrically in at least four directions. The ends of the compression coils 336 may be glue jointed to the proximal end to the catheter body 16 and distally into the transition manifold 316. Alternatively, the pullwires may also be passed through hypodermic tubes and anchored at the distal side wall of the catheter shaft 16 and the transition manifold 316. Moreover, the pullwires may be made from materials such as stainless steel or nitinol and flexible thin wall compression coils, such as stainless steel coils, may be further slid over each pullwire along the catheter shaft 16. Because of the design of the handle assembly 260 and the accessibility of the steering ring 270 to the user, the user may utilize a single hand to operate the handle assembly 260 to control and manipulate the catheter 16 and hood 12 configuration and position within the patient's body. Moreover, the operator may utilize either their right hand 360, e.g., by gripping handle portion 276, or their left hand 362, e.g., by gripping distal handle portion 274, as shown respectively in FIGS. 27A and 27B. As previously described, because the catheter 16 and hood 12 may be repeatedly torqued and repositioned within the patient's body during a procedure, keeping track of the orientation of the deflection of the hood 12 can be difficult, if not impossible, unless fluoroscopy is used. As the handle assembly 260 provides an indication, as described herein, as to which direction the catheter and hood may be configured based upon the handle orientation, an orientation guide 372 may be imprinted directly upon the handle 274, as shown in detail view 370 of FIG. 28. The plane within which the orientation guide 372 lies may be configured to be parallel to the plane within which the proximal steerable section 262 articulates when section control 278 is manipulated such that the operator may be able to predict how the catheter 16 will configure when manipulated. As similarly described above, FIGS. 29A and 29B illustrate a hood positioned within the right atrium of a heart H while coupled to handle assembly 260 positioned external to the body. Handle assembly 260 may be seen as being positioned along plane A while hood 12 and the distal portion of catheter 16 is positioned within corresponding plane A′. As handle assembly 260 is rotated, e.g., at 90°, about its longitudinal axis in a direction of rotation 380 such that handle assembly 260 then lies within a different plane B, hood 12 and the distal steerable portion may also rotate, e.g., at 90°, within the right atrium in a corresponding direction of rotation 380′ such that the hood and catheter then define a corresponding different plane B′. Thus, by merely articulating the handle assembly 260 external to the body in a specified direction, the user may adjust or desirably position or re-position the hood within the body in a known direction without having to utilize additional catheter positioning mechanisms. Additionally and/or alternatively, visual indicators positioned directly upon the hood 12 may also be utilized in coordination with corresponding visual indicators positioned upon the handle itself. The hood 12 may have one or more visual indicators marked upon the distal portion of the hood such that the visual image 390 through the hood may show at least a first directional indicator 392′ along a first portion of the hood, as shown in FIG. 30A. In this example, a second directional indicator 394′ and yet a third corresponding third indicator 396′ may be positioned about a circumference of the hood or hood membrane to represent any number of directions. Handle assembly 260 may thus have one or more directional indicators located directly upon, e.g., steering ring 270, which correspond spatially with the indicators positioned upon the hood or hood membrane, as shown in FIG. 30B. For instance, first directional indicator 392′ on the hood may correspond spatially with first directional indicator 392 on steering ring 270, second directional indicator 394 on the hood may correspond spatially with second directional indicator 394′ on steering ring 270, third directional indicator 396 on the hood may correspond with third directional indicator 396′ on steering ring 270, and so on. Although three directional indicators are shown in this example, fewer than three or more than three may be utilized. Moreover, the location and positioning of the indicators may also be varied, as desired. In use, the directional indicators as viewed through the hood correspond to the direction the hood may move when the steering ring 270 is deflected along the position where the corresponding indicator is located. Thus, deflecting steering ring 270 in direction of actuation 398, e.g., along directional indicator 394, may articulate distal steerable section 264 and hood 12 in a corresponding direction of articulation 400 along the directional indicator 394′ shown on the hood or hood membrane, as shown in FIG. 30C. This removes complexity in steering the hood 12, e.g., when the hood 12 is in a retroflexed position, where directions are reversed with respect to the operator. The catheter control systems described herein may additionally integrate any number of features and controls for facilitate procedures. These features and controls may be integrated into any of the variations described herein. FIG. 31 shows one example where features such as flow rate control, air bubble detection, ablation activation switches, built-in image sensors, etc., may be incorporated into the handle assembly. As shown on handle 52, a flow control 410 switch may be incorporated which may optionally have a high-flow position 412, a no-flow position 414, and an optional suction position 416 to control the inflow and/or outflow of the visualization and/or ablation fluid. One or more fluid reservoirs, e.g., a room temperature purging fluid reservoir 422 and/or a chilled purging fluid reservoir 424, may be fluidly coupled to a processing unit 418 which may control various parameters, e.g., valves, inflow, suction, RF ablation energy generation, bubble detection, etc. Processing unit 418 may also incorporate a pump 420, e.g., peristaltic pump, which may pump or urge the fluids from the reservoir through one or more coupling lines into and/or out from handle 52. Processing unit 418 may also be electrically coupled to handle 52 and may also be able to process, display and store several data, including total amount of saline used for the entire procedure, power and duration of ablation, impedance of tissue in contact-with hood, rate of flow of saline, temperature of saline, and time of detection of air bubbles during the procedure. In the event that handle 52 is used to suction or evacuate fluids out from the body, an additional evacuation reservoir 426 may also be fluidly coupled to handle 52. Additionally, one or more hemostasis valves 428 may also be integrated directly upon handle 52. Moreover, an imaging sensor 430 which may also incorporate a light source, e.g., LEDs, and power supply, may additionally be integrated directly into handle 52. A video cable may be connected to the proximal end of the handle 52 and can be directly plugged into any standard video display monitors (such as ones accepting S-Video, DVI, VGA, RCA inputs), rather than utilizing a separate video processing unit. As processing unit 418 may incorporate processors for detecting various physiological parameters, one or more detection indicators 432, e.g., for bubble detection, and/or ablation actuation switch 434 may be integrated directly upon the handle 52 as an indicator to the operator. If air bubbles are detected in the irrigation channel, the detection indicator 432 may be activated to alert the operator of air bubbles. A soft alarm may also be triggered to further alert the operator. Additionally, with an ablation actuation switch 434 located directly upon handle 52, the operator may be able to instantaneously activate or stop ablation energy from being delivered to the target tissue by depressing switch 434 rather than reaching for a separate ablation generator. Details for tissue ablation under direct visualization and detecting various parameters such as bubble formation are also shown and described in further detail in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/118,439 filed May 9, 2008 (U.S. Pat. Pub. 2009/0030412 A1 ), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Another example of an integrated handle is shown illustratively in FIG. 32. In this example, handle 274 may incorporate an imaging system directly into the handle. As illustrated, the images captured by the imager 440 positioned within or along hood 12 may be focused onto an electronic imaging sensor 444, e.g., CMOS sensor, positioned within handle 274. Imaging sensor 444 may deliver the images directly to the video processor. A light source 448, e.g., LED light source, may also be placed within the handle 274 to deliver light through, e.g., an optical fiber 442 positioned within hood 12, to illuminate the tissue region to be visualized. At the terminal end of the fiber bundle, a focus lens 446, e.g., a combination of spherical lenses, may be positioned proximal to the fiber bundle. An alternative may utilize a GRIN lens which may be used as a simple one piece element which is chromatically aberration corrected and polarization preserved to allow for more design flexibility. Moreover, a GRIN lens is typically more economical than the spherical lenses. The applications of the disclosed invention discussed above are not limited to certain treatments or regions of the body, but may include any number of other applications as well. Modification of the above-described methods and devices for carrying out the invention, and variations of aspects of the invention that are obvious to those of skill in the arts are intended to be within the scope of this disclosure. Moreover, various combinations of aspects between examples are also contemplated and are considered to be within the scope of this disclosure as well. 1-22. (canceled) 23.
