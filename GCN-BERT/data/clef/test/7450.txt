Synthesis of 1-[3-fluoro-5-(trideuteriomethoxy)-2-pyridyl]-7-methoxy-3-methyl-8-(1-methylpyrazol-4-Aimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one (Compound Example 155)
1-(3-Fluoro-5-hydroxy-2-pyridyl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-8-(1-methylpyrazol-4-yl)imidazo-[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one (80 mg, 0.19 mmol, 98%), N,N-dimethylformamide (5.00 ml), potassium carbonate (51.7 mg, 0.37 mmol) and iodo(D3)methane (57.1 mg, 0.37 mmol, 95%) were initially introduced in a 25 ml round-bottomed flask. The solution was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The progress of the reaction was followed by means of LCMS (dichloromethane/MeOH=10:1). The reaction was then terminated by addition of 50 ml of ice-water. The solution was extracted three times with 20 ml of ethyl acetate each time, and the organic phases were combined. The mixture was evaporated in vacuo, giving 38.5 mg (47%) of 1-[3-fluoro-5-(trideuteriomethoxy)-2-pyridyl]-7-methoxy-3-methyl-8-(1-methyl-pyrazol-4-Aimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one as white solid.
