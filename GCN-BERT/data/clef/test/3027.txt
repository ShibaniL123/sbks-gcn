Example 2: 5-((3R,5S,6R)-5-amino-6-(2,5-difluorophenyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)-3-methyl-1-methylsulfonyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole
Step 1: 5-((3R,5S,6R)-5-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-6-(2,5-difluorophenyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)-3-methyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole
To 1,2-dichloroethane (10 mL) were added tert-butyl (2R,3S)-2-(2,5-di-fluorophenyl)-5-oxotetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-ylcarbamate (327 mg, 1 mmol), 3-methyl-2,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3, 4-c]pyrazole (123 mg, 1 mmol) and glacial acetic acid (30 mg, 0.5 mmol), and stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. After cooling in an ice bath, sodium triacetoxyborohydride (672 mg, 3 mmol) was added, slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. Saturated sodium bicarbonate solution was added, and the resulting mixture was extracted with dichloromethane, washed with saturated brine, dried, concentrated and then purified by silica gel column chromatography to give 5-((3R,5S,6R)-5-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-6-(2,5-difluorophenyl) tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)-3-methyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole (145 mg). Yield: 33%.
