Novel protein expression patterns are associated with abnormal cell growth, especially cancer. One type of over-expressed proteins are known as tumor associated antigens (TAAs). Some of these TAAs are expressed only infrequently by an individual tumor. Other TAAs may be shared between histologically similar tumors, while others may be expressed by a variety of histologically distinct cancers as well as fetal tissues. TAAs of the former kind are of little use except in devising an autologous treatment method. In contrast, TAAs that are shared between a wide range of tumors that are histologically similar or even histologically dissimilar have potential applications for immunodiagnosis, immunoprognosis and treatment of patients across a wide number of malignancies. An example of the first type of TAA is the idiotype protein ofa B cell lymphoma. One example of the more widespread TAAs is the MAGE protein isolated from melanoma ceHs. Another type of over-expressed or aberrantly expressed proteins associated with tumors are the expression products of oncogenes. Inhibiting the activity of oncogenes has proven to be a useful means of therapy. There are examples which suggest that raising immunity against growing neoplasm in humans can be enhanced by active immunization with TAAs or the expression product of oncogenes. The purpose of such active specific immunization is induce an immune response to antigens associated with the growth or metastasis of tumors beyond that which is naturally induced by the growing neoplasm. It is believed that a growing neoplasm does not induce a maximum immune response in the host to the proteins that are expressed at increased or aberrant levels. Immunization with TAAs are proving effective in the clinic. Animal models have also demonstrated the efficacy of raising an immune response to oncogenes associated with transformation. Therefore, if a means can be provided to enhance the response to antigens associated with these abnormally expressed proteins, it would prove useful in cancer therapy. Further, identification of specific antigens could also prove useful in the diagnosis, imaging, and staging of cancers. In particular, lung cancer is the most common lethal cancer in the United States. In 1992, 168,000 new cases and 146,000 deaths from lung cancer were estimated. The overall five-year survival rate for newly diagnosed cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is only 10-15%. Therefore. novel means oftrealing lung cancer would prove very useful, as well as means of detecting or imaging lung cancer. Colon cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed maligancy in the U.S.. Although it is often curable by resection if confined to the bowel, colon cancer is nevertheless the second leading cause of cancer death in the U,S. Therefore, novel means of treating, diagnosing, or imaging colon cancer would prove useful.

Brief Description ofthe Drawings Figure 1 represents possible DNA and the protein sequences for AgRM I, i.e., a truncated H2A protein. AgRM1 is estimated as containing 78 amino acids with a MW of 19 kDa as estimated by its mobility in denaturing gel electrophoresis.

Detailed Description of the Invention the invention is based at least in part on the isolation and characterization o gRM1, an antigen associated with cell proliferative disorders, such as metastatic and non-metastatic tumors. AgRM1 was identified as a subsequence ofhistone H2A AgRM1 is approximately 19 kDa, as determined by denaturing gel electrophoresis. AgRM1 is expressed at least in part on the cell surface. AgRM1 is more highly expressed in proliferating cells than in nonproliferating cells. For example, AgRM 1 may be associated with tumors including, for example, breast, colon, gutlung. brain, skin and pancreas. AgRM1 is associated with the cell membranes of cell fines derived from colon cancer and lung cancer. AgRM1 is therefore useful for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of cell proliferative disorders. Thus, in accordance with the invention, there are provided isolated and purified subsequences ofhistone H2A, and nucleic acids that encode isolated and purified subsequences ofhistone H2A. In one embodiment, an isolated or purified histone H2A polypeptide specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142. In various aspects, the histone H2A polypeptide sequence has a deletion at the amino terminus relative to full length native human hlstone H2A (e.g., of at least about 10, 20, 30, 40, 45, 50, 51, 55, 60, 70, 80 amino acids from the amino terminus relative to full length native human hlstone H2A). In various additional aspects, the histone H2A polypeptide consists of a polypeptide having no more than about 50 to 70. about 70 to 90, about 90 to 100, and about 128 amino acids in length H2A polypeptide sequences of the invention include mammalian sequences, including human (as set forth in Figure 1 ), polymorphic variants thereof(e.g., polypeptides encoded by a sequence selected the group consisting of from GenBank Accession Nos. AF058445; AF058446; AF044286; AF058444; NM138609: NM138609" BC013331 : AF054174" AF041483; NM138610.1; and NM004893.2), and variants of these or similar sequences. Other, non-limiting, examples of these variants are set forth in Table 1, above. Definitions The terms "protein," "polypeptide" and "peptide" axe used interchangeably herein to refer to two or more covalently linked amino acids, or "residues," through an amide bond or equivalent. Polypeptides are of unlimited length. The amino acids may be linked by nonnatural and non-amide chemical bonds including, for example, those formed with glutaraldehyde, N-hydoxysuccinimide esters, bifunctional maleimides, or N,N'- dicydohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). Non-amide bonds include, for example ketomethylene, aminomethylene, olefin, ether, thioether and the like (see, e.g., Spatola(1983) in Chemistry and Biochemistry of Amino Acids. Peptides and Proteins. Vol. 7, pp 267-357, peptide and Backbone Modifications." Marcel Decker, NY). The molecular weight of proteins is frequently estimated in comparison to markers of known molecular weight in denaturing gel electrophoresis, i.e., SDS-PAGE. See e.g. the standard standard techniques of SDS-PAGE as first published by Laemmli and co-workers and as set forth in Sambrook et al., In: Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual 3 rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001); and Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley Interscience, N.Y., 1989. As used herein, the term "isolated," when used as a modifier of an invention composition (e.g., polypeptides and nucleic acids, and modified forms, subsequences, cells, and vectors thereof), means that the compositions are made by the hand of man or are separated from their naturally occurring in vivo environment. Generally, compositions so separated are substantially free of one or more materials with which they normally associate with in nature, for example, one or more protein, nucleic acid, lipid, carbohydrate, cell membrane. Thus, an isolated protein is typically substantially free of one or more materials with which it may typically associate with in nature. The term "isolated" does not exclude alternative physical forms, such as polypeptide multimers, post-translational modifications (e.g., phospho iation, glycosylation) de rvatized forms. An "isolated" protein can also be "purified" when free of most or all of the materials with which it typically associates with in nature. Thus. an isolated molecule that also is substantially pure does not include polypeptides or polynucleotides present among millions of other sequences, such as polypeptides of a polypeptide library or nucleic acids of a genomic or cDNA library, for example. Of course, a "purified" molecule can be combined with one or more other molecules. Thus, the term "purified" does not exclude combination compositions made by the hand of man. Purified can be at least about 60% or more of the molecule by mass. Purity can also be about 70% or 80% or more, and can be greater, for example, about 90% or more. Purity can be determined by any appropriate method, including, for example, UV spectroscopy, chromatography (e.g., HPLC, gas phase), gel electrophoresis (e.g., silver o coomassie staining) and sequence analysis (nucleic acid and peptide). The term "antibody" refers to a protein that binds to other molecules (antigens) via heavy and light chain variable domains, VII and VL. respectively. Antibodies include lgG. IgD, IgA, IgM andIgE, subtypes, and mixtures thereof. Antibodies may bepolyclonal or monoclonal, intact immunoglobulin molecules, two full length heavy chains linked by disulfide bonds to two full length light chains, or subsequences (i.e. fragments) thereof, with our without constant region, that bind to an epitope of an antigen, and mixtures thereof Antibodies may comprise heavy or light chain variable regions, VH or VL individually, or in any combination. Antibodies may be engineered to contain an antigen binding site, both VH and VL regions, in a single chain. Polypeptides and nucleic acids of the invention include modified or variant forms. The term "modify" and grammatical variations thereof, when used in reference to a composition such as a polypeptide or nucleic acid, means that the modified composition deviates from a reference composition. Polypeptide modifications include amino acid substitutions, additions and deletions (subsequences and fragments), which axe also referred to as "variants." Polypeptide modifications also include one or more D-amino acids substituted for L-amino acids (and mixtures thereof), structural and functional analogues, for example, peptidomimetics having synthetic or non-natural amino acids or amino acid analogues and derivatized forms. Polypeptide modifications further include fusion (chimeric) polypeptide sequences, which is an amino acid sequence having one or more molecules not normally present in a reference native (wild type) sequence covalently attached to the sequence, for example, one or more amino acids ofnon-histone H2A attached to histone H2A polypeptide that specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142. Such chimeric polypepfides can comprise apoptotic factors, differentiative factors, toxins, chemoldnes and eytoldnes (interleuldns, interferons). Modifications include cyclic structures such as an end-to-end amide bond between the amino and carboxyterminus of the molecule or intraor inter-molecular disulfide bond. Polypeptides may be modified in vitro or in vivo, e.g., posl-translalionally modified to include, for example, sugar residues, phosphate groups, ubiquitin, SUMA, fatty acids, acetyl groups, or lipids. Modifications include an activity or function of a reference composition (e.g., binding to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142). A modified protein can have an amino acid substitution, addition or deletion (e.g., ! -3.3-5, 5-10 or more). In a particular non-limiting example, the substitution is a conservative amino acid substitution. A "conservative substitution" means the replacement of one amino acid by a biologically, chemically or structurally similar residue. Biologically similar means that the substitution is compatible with biological activity, e.g.. binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142. Structurally similar means that the amino acids have side chains with similar length, such as alanine, glycine andserine, or having similar size. Chemical similarity means that the residues have the same charge or are both hydrophilic or hydrophobic. Particular examples include the substitution of one hydrophobic residue, such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or methionine for another, or the substitution of one polar residue for another, such as the substitution of arginine for lysine, glutamic for aspartic acids, or glutamine for asparagine, serine for threonine, and the like. Modified polypeptides may include amino acid sequence with about 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or more identity to a sequence of H2A as set forth in Figure 1. The identity can be over a defined area of the protein, such as 50, 60, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79. 80. 85 90 or more amino acids. The term "identity" and grammatical variations thereof, mean that two or more referenced entities are the same. Thus. where two protein sequences are identical, they have the same amino acid sequence."Areas of identity" means that a portion of two or more referenced entities are the same. Thus, where two protein sequences are identical over one or more sequence regions they share identity in these regions. The term "substantial identity" means that the identity is structurally or functionally significant. That is, the identity is such that the molecules are structurally identical or have at least one of the same functions (e.g., biological function) even though the molecules are different. Due to variation in the amount of sequence conservation between structurally and functionally related proteins, the amount of sequence identity for substantial identity will depend upon the type of protein, the region and any function. There can be as little as 30% sequence identity for proteins to have substantial identity, but typically there is more, e.g., about 50%, 60%, 75%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, identity to a reference sequence. For nucleic acid sequences, 50% sequence identity or more typically constitutes substantial homology, but again can vary depending on the comparison region and its function, if any. The extent of identity between two sequences can be ascertained using a computer program and mathematical algorithm known in the art. Such algorithms that calculate percent sequence identity (homology) generally account for sequence gaps and mismatches over the comparison region. For example, a BLAST (e.g., BLAST 2.0) search algorithm (see, e.g., Altschul et al. (1990) J. Mol.Biol. 215:403-10, publicly available through NCBI) has exemplary search parameters as follows: Mismatch -2; gap open 5; gap extension 2. For polypeptide sequence comparisons, a BLASTP algorithm is typically used in combination with a scoring matrix, such as PAM100 PAM 250. and BLOSUM 62 As used herein, the term "subsequence" or "fragment" means a portion of the full length molecule For example, a subsequence of H2A is at least one amino acid less in length than full length H2A (e.g. one or more internal or terminal amino acid deletions from either amino or carboxy-termini). Subsequences therefore can be any length up to, but not including, the full length molecule. Subsequences include portions which retain at least part of the function or activity of a full length sequence. Subsequences may also acquire a function or activity absent from a full length sequence. For example, a protein subsequence may display an epitope that is absent from or hidden in a full length sequence. In particular, an invention isolated or purified H2A poiypeptide binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142, whereas full-length wild type H2A does not exhibit detectable specific binding to monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142. Modified polypeptides and nucleic acids can include one or more non-native (wildtype) functions, or be "multifunctional," which means that the composition referred to has one or more different or additional activities or functions. Particular non-limiting examples include, for example, enzyme activity, ligand or receptor binding (substrates, agonists and antagonists), detection, purification, andtoxic@. A particular example of an additional function is a "detectable label," which refers to a molecule that enables detection of the conjugated molecule. Examples of detectable labels include chelators, photoactive agents, radioisotopes and radionuclides (alpha, beta and gamma emitters), fluorescent agents and paramagnetic ions. Radioactive labels include, for example, 3H, 14C, 32p, 33p, 35S, t2 i, 131 ..... mon-raaloacuve moieties such as gold particles, colored glass or plastic polystyrene, polypropylene, or latex beads, and amino acid sequences such as tags, as set forth herein. Detectable labels include enzyme activity (e.g., green fluorescent protein, ace .tyltransferase, galactosidase, glucose oxidase, peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), urease and alkalinephosphatase). Detectable fluorescent compounds include, for example, fluorescein isothiocyanate, rbodarrfine, phycoe .rytherin, phycocyanin, allophycocyanin, o-phthaldehyde, fluorescamine, and commerciallyavalailable fluorophores such as Alexa Fluor 350, Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 532, Alexa Fluor 546.

Another particular example of an additional function is a "tag," which refers to a molecule conjugated to another that allows detection, iolafion or purification. Specific examples of tags include immunoglobulins, T7, polyhistidine tags, glutathione-S-transferase, a chitin-binding tag, calmodulin-binding tag, myc tag, biotin tag, avidin tag, and a Xpress epitope (detectable bymti-Xpress antibody;lnvitrogen, Carlsbad,Calif., USA). Additional candidate modified forms include added cytotoxicity functions (e.g., bacterial cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, anthrax toxin lethal factor, Pseudomonas exotoxin A, diphtheria toxin, plant toxin ricin, radionuclides such as 478c 67Cu. 72Se. 88y. 90Sr' 90y, 9 Ru" 99Tc" l°SRh" lllir k 1251. 131I. 149Tb' 1538m" 186Re' 188Re' 194Os' 2°3pb' ZllAt' ZlZBi' ZBBi' 212pb' 223Ra./aSAc. 227Ac. 228Th. and cvtotoxic drugs). Modifiedpolypeptides and nucleic acids therefore also include addition of functional entities, covalently or non-covalently attached to the polypeptides and nucleic acids of the invention. Polypeptides, including modified forms such as substitutions, additions, and deletions (e. g., subsequences and fragments), can be produced u Q mbinant technology of polypeptide encoding nucleic acids via cell expression or in vitro translation. Polypeptides including antibodies can also be produced by a chemical synthesizer (see, e.g., Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Antibodies can be expressed fromrecombinantly produced antibody-encoding nucleic acid (see, e.g., Harlow and Lane, Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 1999; Fitzgerald et aL, J.A.CS. 117:11075 (1995); Gram et aL,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:3576 (1992)). Enzymes such proteases (e.g., pepsin and papam) can be used to generate subsequences and fragments. The invention provides nucleic acids encoding and vectors containing invention polypeptides, including modified forms otH2A Also provided are transformed cells that contain H2A polypeptide of the invention. Transformed cells including nucleic acid encoding H2A polypeptide of the invention are further provided. Transformed cells include prokaryotic an0eukaryotic cells, such asbacteria, fungi, insect and mammalian cells in culture, ex vivo or in vivo. As used herein, "nucleic acid," refers to at least two or more riboor deoxyribonucleic acid base pairs (nucleotides) linked through a phosphoester bond or equivalent. Nucleic acids include polynucleotides and polynucleosides. Nucleic acids include circular and linear, single, double and triplex molecules. A nucleic acid molecule may belong exclusively to or be in a mixture, but not limited to: RNA, DNA, cDNA, genomic nucleic acid, non-genomic nucleic acid, naturally occurring and non naturally occurring nucleic acid and synthetic nucleic acid. Nucleic acids can be of any length, and typically range from about 20 nucleotides to about 10 Kb, about 10nucleotides to about 5,000, about 1 Kb to about 5 Kb or less, about 1000 to about 500 nucleotides or less in length. Nucleic acids can also be shorter, for example, about 100 to about 500 nucleotides, or from about 12 to about 25, about 25 to about 50, about 50 to about 100, about 100 to about 250, or about 250 to about 500 nucleotides in length. Nucleic acids further include modifications such as nucleofide and nucleoside substitutions, additions and deletions, as well as derivatized forms and fusion sequences (e.g., encoding chimeric H2A polypeptide). For example, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code, nucleic acids include sequences and subsequences that are degenerate with respect to nucleic acids that encodeH2A as set forth in Figurel Other examples are nucleic acids complementary to a sequence that encodes H2A as set forth in Figure 1. Nucleic acid deletions (subsequences) have from about 10 to about 25, about 25 to about 50, about 50 to about 100, about 100 to about 200, about 200 to about 300, about 300 to about 500, about 500 to about 1000 nucleotides, or more. Such nucleic acids are useful for expressing H2A polypeptide fragments, for genetic manipulation (as primers and templates for PCR amplification), and as probes to detect the presence or an amount of a sequence encoding an H2A histone polypeptide of the invention in vitro, in a cell, culture medium, biological sample (e.g., tissue, organ., blood or serum), or in a subject or patient in vivo. Nucleic acids that hybridize at high stringency to nucleic acids that encode an H2A polypeptide, a subsequence thereof and nucleic acid sequences complementary to the encoding nucleic acids, axe provided. Hybridizing nucleic acids axe useful for detecting the presence or an amount of a sequence encoding an H2A histone polypeptide of the invention in vitro, or in a cell, culture medium, biological sample (e.g., tissue, organ, blood or serum), or in a subject or patient in vivo. The term "hybridize" refers to the binding between nucleic acid sequences. Hybridizing sequences will generally have more than about 50% homology, to a nucleic acid that encodes an ammo acid sequence of RM4. The hybridization region between hybridizing sequences can extend over at least about 10 to about 15 nucleotides, about 15 to about nucleotides, about 20 to about 30 nucleotides, about 30 to about 50 nucleotides, about 50 to about 100 nucleotides, or about 100 to about 200 nucleotides or more. As is understood by one skilled in the art, the TM (melting temperature) is the temperature at which binding between two nucleic acid sequences is no longer stable For two sequences to bind, the temperature of a hybridization reaction must be less than the calculated TM for the sequences under the hybridization conditions. The T is influenced by the amount of sequence complementarity, length, composition (%GC), type of nucleic acid (RNA vs. DNA), and the amount of salt, detergent and other components in the reaction (e.g., formamide). All of these factors axe considered in establishing appropriate hybridization conditions (see, e.g., the hybridization techniques and formula for calculating TM described in Sambrook eal., InMolecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3 ra ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratow Press,2001). See also Ausubel etal.. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Assoc. and Wiley lnterscience, N.Y., 1989. Typically, wash conditions axe adjusted to attain the desired degree of hybridization stringency. Thus, hybridization stringency can be determined empirically, for example, by washing under particular conditions, e.g., at low stringency conditions or high stringency conditions. Optimal conditions for selective hybridization will vary depending on the particular hybridization reaction involved. An example of high stringency hybridization conditions axe as follows: 2X SSC/0.1% SDS at about 37 °C or 42 °C (hybridization conditions); 0.5X SSC/0.1% SDS at about room temperature (low stringency wash); 0.5X SSC/0.1% SDS at about 42 °C (moderate stringency wash); and 0.1 X SSC/0.1% SDS at about 65 °C (high stringency wash). Nucleic acids can be produced using various standard cloning and chemical synthesis techniques. Such techniques include nucleic acid amplification, e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with genomic DNA or cDNA targets using primers (e.g., a degenerate primer mixture) capable of annealing to the H2A encoding sequence; and chemical synthesis of nucleic acid sequences. The sequences produced can then be translated in vitro, or cloned into a plasmid and propagated and then expressed in a cell (e.g., microorganism, such as yeast or bacteria, a eukaryote such as an animal or mammalian cell or in a plant). The invention further provides expression cassettes including a nucleic acid encoding an H2A histone polypeptide of the invention operably linked to an expression control element. The term "operably linked" refers to a physical or functional relationship between the elements referred to that permit them to operate in their intended fashion. Thus, an expression control element "operably linked" to a nucleic acid means that the control element modulates nucleic acid transcription and, as appropriate, translation of the transcript. Physical linkage is not required for the elements to be operably linked. For example, a minimal element can be linked to a nucleic acid encoding an H2A histone polypeptide of the invention. A second element that controls expression of an operably linked nucleic acid encoding a protein that functions "in trans" to bind to the minimal element can influence expression of the H2A polypeptide. Because the second element regulates expression of H2A polypeptide, the second element is operably linked to the nucleic acid encoding the H2A polypeptide even though it is not physically linked. The term "expression control element" refers to nucleic acid that influences expression of an operably linked nucleic acid. Promoters and enhancers are particular nonlimiting examples of expression control elements. A "promoter sequence" is a regulatory region capable of initiating transcription of a downstream (3' direction) coding sequence. The promoter sequence includes nucleotides for facilitating transcription initiation. Enhancers also regulate gene expression, but can function a distance from the transcription start site of the gene to which it is operably linked (e.g., at either 5' or 3' ends of the gene, as well as within the gene). Additional expression control elements include leader sequences and fusion partner sequences, internal ribosome binding sites (IRES) elements for the creation ofmulligene, or polycistronic, messages, splicing signal for introns, maintenance of the correct reading frame of the gene to permit in-frame translation of mRNA, polyadenylation signal to provide propeipolyadenylafion of the transcript ofa gene of interest, and stop codons. Expression control elements include "constitutive" elements such that transcription of the operably linked nucleic acid occurs without a signal or stimuli. Expression control elements that confer expression in response to a signal or stimuli, which either increases or decreases expression of the operably linked nucleic acid, are "regulatable." A regulatable element that increases expression of the operably linked nucleic acid in response to a signal or stimuli is referred to as an "inducible element." A regulatable element that decreases expression of the operably linked nucleic acid in response to a signal or stimuli is referred to as a "repressible element" (i.e., the signal decreases expression; when the signal is removed or absent, expression is increased). Expression control elements include elements active in a particular tissue or cell type, and are referred to as "tissue-specific" expression control elements. Tissue-specific expression control elements are typically active in specific cell or tissue types because they are recognized by transcriptional activator proteins, or other regulators of transcription, that are unique to the specific cell or tissue type. Expression control elements include full-length nucleic acid sequences, such as native promoter and enhancer elements, as well as subsequences or nucleotide variants thereof (e.g., substituted/mutated or other forms that differ from native sequences) which retain all or part of full-length or non-variant control element function (confer regulation, e.g., retain some amount of inducibility in response to a signal or stimuli). For bacterial expression, constitutive promoters include TT, as well as inducible promoters such as pL of'bacteriophage plac. ptrp, ptac (ptrp-lac hybrid promoter). In insect cell systems, constitutive or inducible promoters (e.g., ecdysone) may be used. Other examples of insect cell promoters include the p! 0 promter and the polyhedrin promoter. In yeast, constitutive promoters include, for example, ADH or LEU2 and inducible promoters such as GAL (see. eg. Ausubel et al In: Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. Ch. 13, ed., Greene Publish. Assoc. & Wiley lnterscience, 1988; Grant et al., (1987) In: Methods in Enzymoloqv. 153:516-544, eds. Wu & Grossman, 1987, Acad Press, N.Y. Glover, DNA Cloning. Vol. II, Ch. 3, IRL Press, Wash., D.C., 1986; Bitter (1987) In: Methods in Enzymology. 152:673-684, eds. Berger & Kimmel, Acad. Press. NY. Strathem et al., The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces (1982) eds. Cold Spring Harbor Press. Vols I and II; and Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3 rd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001). For mammalian expression, constitutive promoters of viral or other origins may be used. For example, SV40, or viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) and the like, or inducible promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g, metallothionein IIA promoter; heat shock promoter, steroid/thyroid hormone/retinoic acid response elements) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the inducible mouse mammary tumor virus LTR) are used. The invention also provides stably and transiently transformed cells and progeny thereof, where progeny includes all descendent cells, into which a nucleic acid molecule encoding an H2A histone polypeptide of the invention has been introduced by means of recombinant DNA techniques invitro, ex vivo or in vivo. The transformed cells can be propagated and the introduced nucleic acid transcribed, or encoded protein expressed. Transformed cells include but are not limited to prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells such as bacteria, fungi, plant, insect, and animal (e.g., mammalian, including human) cells. The cells may be present in culture, in tissue or an organ ex vivo, or in a subject or patient. A progeny cell may not be identical to the parental cell, since there may be mutations that occur during parental cell replication. The term "transformed" means a change in a cell following incorporation of nucleic acid (e.g., a transgene) or protein exogenous to the cell. Thus, "transformed cells" include cells into which, or a progeny of which, a nucleic acid or polypeptide has been introduced by means of recombinant DNA techniques. Cell transformation to produce such cells may be caned out as described herein or using techniques known in the art. Accordingly, methods of producing cells including the nucleic acids and polypeptides of the invention axe also provided. Typically, cell transformation with a nucleic acid employs a "vector," which refers to a plasmid, vires, such as a viral vector, or other vehicle known in the art that can be manipulated by insertion or incorporation of a nucleic acid sequence. For genetic manipulation "cloning vectors" can be employed, and to transcribe or translate the inserted polynucleofide "expression vectors" can be employed. Such vectors axe useful for introducing nucleic acids, including a nucleic acid that encodes an H2A polypeptide operably linked with an expression control element, and expressing the H2A polypeptide in vitro (e.g., in solution or in solid phase), in cells or in a subject or patient in vivo. A vector generally contains an origin of replication for propagation in a cell. Control elements, including expression control elements as set forth herein, present within a vector, can be included to facilitate transcription and translation. Vectors can include a selection marker, which is a gene that allows for the selection of cells containing the gene. "Positive selection" refers to a process whereby only cells that contain the selection marker will be selected. Drag resistance is one example of a positive selection marker; cells containing the marker will survive in culture medium containing the selection drug, and cells lacking the marker will die. Selection markers include drug resistance genes such as neo, which confers resistance to (3418; hygr, which confers resistance to hygromycin; and puro which confers resistance to puromycin. Other positive selection marker genes include genes that allow identification or screening of cells containing the marker. These genes include genes for fluorescent proteins (GFP and GFP-like chromophores, luciferase), thelacZ gene, the alkaline phosphatase gene, and surface markers such as CD8, among others. "Negative selection" refers to a process whereby cells containing a negative selection marker axe not selected, for example, due to exposure to an appropriate negative selection agent. For example, cells which contain the herpes simplex virus-thvmidine ldnasdHSV-tk) gene00Vigler et al. Cell x1:223 (1977)) axe sensitive to the drug gancyclovir (GANC). Similarly, the gpt gene renders cells sensitive to 6-thioxanthine. Vectors can also include an amplification marker such as the gene providing resistance to methotrexate (see e.g.U.S. Patent 5,179,017), or the CAD gene (see, e.g., Wahl et al., Somat. Cell Mol. Genet, 12:339 (1986). Viral vectors included axe those based on retroviral, adeno-associated virus (AAV), adenovirus, reovirus, lentivirus, rotavirus genomes, simian virus 40 (SV40) or bovine papilloma virus (Cone et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:6349 (1984); Eukaryotic Viral Vectors, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Gluzman ed., 1982; Sarver et at. Mol Cell. Biol. 1:486 (1981)). Additional viral vectors useful for expression includoarvovirus, rotavirus, Norwalk virus, coronaviruses, paramyxo and rhabdoviruses, togavirus (e.g., sindbis virus and semliki forest virus) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Mammalian expression vectors include those designed for in vivo and ex vivo expression, such as AAV (U.S. Patent No. 5,604,090). AAV vectors have previously been shown to provide expression of Factor IX in humans and in mice at levels sufficient for therapeutic benefit (Kay et al, Nat. Genet. 24:257 (2000); Nakai et al., Blood 91:4600 (1998)). Adenoviral vectors (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,700,470, 5,731,172 and 5,928,944), herpes simplex virus vectors (U.S. Patent No. 5,501,979) retrovira] (e.g., lentivirus vectors axe useful for infecting dividing as well as non-dividing cells and foamy virues) vectors (U. S. Patent Nos. 5,624,820, 5,693,508, 5,665,577, 6,013,516 and 5,674,703 and WIPO publications WO92/05266 and WO92/14829) and papilloma virus vectors (e.g., human and bovine papilloma vims) have all been employed in gene therapy (U.S. Patent No. 5,719,054). Vectors also include cytomegalovirus (CMV) based vectors (U.S. Patent No. 5,561,063). Vectors that efficiently deliver genes to cells of the intestinal tract have been developed (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,821,235, 5,786,340 601:110,456). Introduction of polypeptides and nucleic acids into target cells can also be carried out by methods known in the art such as osmotic shock (e.g., calcium phosphate), electroporation, microinjoction, cell fusion, etc. Introduction ofpolypeptides and nucleic acids in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo can also be accomplished using other techniques. For example, a polymeric substance, such as polyesters, polyamine acids, hydrogel, pol)Mnyl pyrrolidone, ethylene-vinylacetate, methylcellulose. carbo.xymelhylcellulose, protamine sulfate, or lactide/glycolide copolymers, polylactid glycolide copolymers, or ethylenevinvlacetate copolymers. Polypeptides and nucleic acids can be entrapped in microcapsules prepared bycoacervation techniques or bymterfacial polymerization, for example, by the use ofhydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin-microcapsules, or poly (methylmethacrolate) microcapsules, respectively, or in a colloid drug delivery system. Colloidal dispersion systems include macromolecule complexes, nano-capsules, microspheres, beads, andlipid-based systems, includingoil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, and liposomes. Liposomes for introducing various compositions into cells, including polypeptides and nucleic acids, are known to one skilled in the art and include, for example, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserme, lipofectin andDOTAP, (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4.844.904. 5.000,959.4,863.740, 4,975,282, GIBCO-BRL. Gaithersburg. Md) Piperazine based amphilic catmmc lipids useful for gene therapy also are known (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,861,397). Cationic lipid systems also are known (see, e.g., U.S. PatentNo. 5,459,127). Accordingly, viral and non-viral vector means of delivery into cells or tissue, in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo are included. H2A histone polypeptides dl e invention and nucleic acids can be combined with any other compound or agent that provides an enhanced or synergistic therapeutic benefit. The invention therefore also provides combination compositions including an H2A histone polypeptide of the invention or an nucleicacid encoding a H2A histone ofthe invention and one or more additional compounds or agents and methods of using the combinations. For example, anH2A histone polypeptide of the invention may be combined with a compound or agent that has anti-cell proliferative (e.g., anti-tumor) activity or immune system-enhancing activity. As used here, the term "anti-cell proliferative activity," when used in reference to a compound, agent, therapy or treatment, means that the compound, agent, therapy or treatment, reduces or inhibits cell proliferation or growth, stimulates or promotes cell apoptosis, lysis, necrosis or differentiation. The term "immune system-enhancing." when used in reference to a compound, agent, therapy or treatment, means that the compound, agent, therapy or treatment, provides an increase, stimulation, induction or promotion of an immune response, humoral or cell-mediated. Agents or compositions which bring about an enhanced immune response are variously referred to as "vaccines" or "immunogens." Such anti-cell proliferative and immune system-enhancing therapies and treatments can reduce or inhibit cell proliferation or enhance immune response generally, or reduce or inhibit cell proliferation of, or enhance immune response towards, a specific target, such as a cell proliferative disorder (e.g., a tumor). Specific non-limiting examples of anti-cell proliferative and immune systemenhancing agents include monoclonal, polyclonal antibody and mixtures thereof. Antibodies include antibodies that bind to tumor-associated antigens (TAA). A "tumor associated antigen" or "TAA" refers to an antigen expressed by a rumor cell. TAAs may be expressed in amounts greater in tumor cells than a normal non-tumor cell counterpart, or may be expressed at similar levels, or at levels less than a normal cell counterpart. Particular non-limiting examples of TAAs that can be targeted and TAA binding antibodies include, for example, human IBD12 monoclonal antibody which binds to epithelial cell surface H antigen (U.S. Patent No. 4,814,275); M195 antibody which binds to leukemia cell CD33 antigen (U.S. PatentNo 6,599,505): monoclonal antibody DS6 which binds to ovarian carcinoma CA6 tumor-associated antigen (U.S. Patent No. 6,596,503); and BR96 antibody which binds to Le carbohydrate epitope expressed by colon, breast, ovary, and lung carcinomas.

Additional examples of immune system-enhancing agents include immune cells such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, NK cells and B-cells expressing antibody against the tumor. Cytokines that enhance or stimulate immunog aicity against tumor such as IL-2, IL-1 c IL-113, IL-3. IL-6, IL-7. granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GMCSF). IFN-y, 1L-12, TNF-ct, andTNF]3 are also non-limiting examples ofimmunesystemenhancing agents. Chemokines including MIP-I x, MIP-113, RANTES, SDF-1, MCP-1, MCP-2.

GROIn GRO[3, ENA-78, GCP-2, PBP/CTAPIII[3-TG/NAP-2, Mig, PBSF!SDF-1. and lymphotactin are additional non-limiting examples of immune system-enhancing agents. An "anti-tumor," "anti-cancer" or "anti-neoplastic" treatment, therapy, activity or effect refers to any compound, agent, therapy or treatment regimen or protocol that inhibits, decreases, slows, reduces or preventshyperplastic, tumor, cancer omeoplastic growth. metastasis, proliferation or survival. Anti-tumor compounds, agents, therapies or treatments can operate by disrupting, inhibiting or delaying cell cycle progression or cell proliferation; stimulating or enhancing apoptosis, lysis or cell death or necrosis; stimulating or enhancing cell differentiation: inhibiting nucleic acid or protein synthesis or metabolism; and inhibiting cell division, or decreasing, reducing or inhibiting cell survival, or production or utilization of a necessary cell survival factor, growth factor or signaling pathway (extracellular or intracellular). Examples of anti-tumor therapy include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy (ionizing or chemical), local thermal (h.vperthermia) therapy and surgical resection. Specific non-limiting examples of agent classes having anti-cell proliferative and antitumor activities include alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, plant extracts, plant alkaloids, nitrosoureas, hormones,nucleoside andnucleotide analogues.

Other examples of chemotherapeutic agents are listed ilt./.S. Patent No. 6,608,096. The term "treating" refers to administering a composition to an organism afflicted with an abnormal condition, such as a cell proliferative disorder, where the administration of the composition has a therapeutic effect and at least partially alleviates or abrogates the abnormal condition. Note that the treatment need not provide a complete cure and the treatment will be considered effective if at least one symptom is improved or eradicated. The treatment may reduce mortality. Furthermore, the treatment need not provide a permanent improvement of the medical condition or other abnormal condition, such as a cell proliferative disorder, although this is preferable. The treatment may work by killing the cancerous cells, facilitating the killing of the eancerours cells, inhibiting the growth of the cancerous cells, and/or inhibiting the process of the metastasis of the cancer. The treatment may also work by reducing the rumor volume, inhibiting an increase in rumor volume, inhibiting the progression of the tumor, stimulating tumor cell lysis, stimulating tumor cell lysis necrosis, or stimulating tumor cell lysis apoptosis. The term "patient" refers to a living subject who has presented at a clinical setting with a particular symptom or symptoms suggesting the need for treatment with a therapeutic agent. The treatment may either be generally accepted in the medical community or it may be experimental. In some embodiments, the patient is a mammal, including animals such as dogs, cats, pigs, cows, sheep, goats, horses, rats, and mice. In preferred embodiments, the patient is a human. A patient's diagnosis can alter during the course of disease progression, either spontaneously or during the course of a therapeutic regimen or treatment. The term "contacting" as used herein refers to adding together a solution or composition comprising the test compound with a liquid medium bathing the H2A histone polypeptide of invention or a cell comprising polyethylene of the invention. The solution comprising the compound may also comprise another component, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). DMSO facilitates the uptake of the test compound or compounds into the cells of the methods. The solution comprising the test compound may be added to the medium bathing the cells by utilizing a delivery apparatus, such as a pipette-based device or syringebased device. The invention further provides kits including one or more H2A polypeptides and nucleic acids of the invention, including pharmaceutical formulations, packaged into suitable packaging material. In one embodiment, a kit includes an H2A polypeptide. As used herein, the term "packaging material" refers to a physical structure housing the components of the kit. The packaging material can maintain the components sterilely, and can be made of material commonly used for such purposes (e.g., paper, corrugated fiber, glass, plastic, foil, ampules, etc.). The label or packaging insert can include appropriate written instructions, for example, practicing a method of the invention, e.g., diagnosing a cell-proliferative disorder, detecting well-proliferative disorder, treating cell-prolferative disorder, etc. Kits of the invention therefore can additionally include instructions for using the kit components in a method. Thus, in additional embodiments, a kit includes a label or packaging insert including instructions for expressing an H2A histone polypeptide of the invention or a nucleic acid encoding an H2A histone polypeptide of the invention in cells in vitro, in vivo, or ex vivo. In yet additional embodiments, a kit includes a label or packaging insert including instructions for treating a subject or patient (e.g., a subject or patient having or at risk of having a cell proliferative disorder such as a tumor) with an H2A histone polypeptide of the invention or nucleic acid encoding an H2A histone polypeptide of the invention in vivo, or ex vivo. In further embodiments, a kit includes a label or packaging insert including instructions for detecting the presence of, or the expression level of, AgRM1 in vitro or in vivo (e.g., to indicate or diagnose, or to provide a prognosis for, a subject or patient having or at risk of having a cell proliferative disorder). Instructions can therefore include instructions for practicing any of the methods of the invention described herein. For example, invention pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration to a subject or patient. Instructions may additionally include indications of a satisfactory clinical endpoint or any adverse symptoms that mayoccur, or additional information required by regulatory agencies such as the Food and Drag Administration for use on a human subject. The instructions may be on "printed matter," e.g, on paper or cardboard within the kit, on a label affixed to the kit or packaging material, or attached to a vial or tube containing a component of the kit. Instructions may comprise voice or video tape and additionally be included on a computer readable medium, such as a disk (floppy diskette or hard disk), optical CD such as CDor DVD-ROM/RAM, magnetic tape, electrical storage media such as RAM and ROM and hybrids of these such as magnetic/optical storage media. Invention kits can additionally include a buffering agent, a preservative, or a protein/nucleic acid stabilizing agent. The kit can also include control components for assaying for activity, e.g.. a control sample or a standard. Each component of the kit can be enclosed within an individual container or in a mixture and all of the various containers can be within single or multiple packages. H2A polypeptides and nucleic acids of the invention, including modified forms, can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions. Such pharmaceutical compositions are useful for administration to a subject or patient in vivo or ex vivo, and for providing therapy for a physiological disorder or condition treatable with an H2A histone polypeptide of the invention or nucleic acid, e.g., a cell-proliferative disorder (tumor) of the breast, colon, gut, brain, lung, skin or pancreas. Pharmaceutical compositions include "pharmaceutically acceptable" and "physiologically acceptable" carriers, diluents recipients. As used herein the terms "pharmaceutically acceptable" and "physiologically acceptable" include solvents (aqueous or non-aqueous), solutions, emulsions, dispersionmedia, coatings, isotonic and absorption promoting or delaying agents, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Such formulations can be contained in a liquid; emulsion, suspension, syrup or elixir, or solid form; tablet (coated or uncoated), capsule (hard or soft), powder, granule, crystal, or microbead Supplementary compounds(eg., preservativesantibaeterial, antiviral and antifungal agents) can also be incorporated into the compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated to be compatible with a particular local or systemic route of administration. Thus, pharmaceutical compositions include carriers, diluents, or excipients suitable for administration by particular routes. Specific nonlimiting examples of routes of administration for compositions of the invention are parenteral, e.g., intravenous,intradermal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, oral,transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraaeetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment oftonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose, pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. Pharmaceutical compositions for injection include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL TM (BASF, Parsippany, N J) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. Fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Antibacterial and antifungal agents include, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid and thimerosal. Isotonic agents, for example, sugars,polyalcohols such asmannitol, sorbitol, sodium chloride can be included in the composition. Including an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin can prolong absorption of injectable compositions. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound(s) in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of above ingredients followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle containing a basic dispersion medium and other ingredients as above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, methods of preparation include, for example, vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. For transmucosal or transderrnal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays, inhalation devices (e.g., aspirators)or suppositories. Fortransdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, creams or patches. H2 A bistone polypeptides of the invention and nucleic acids encoding them, including modified forms, can be prepared with carriers that protect against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation or a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl stearate. The compositions can also be delivered using implants and microencapsulated delivery systems to achieve local or systemic sustained delivery or controlled release. Biodegradable, biocompatable polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen,polyorthoesters, andpolylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations are known to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to cells or tissues using antibodies or viral coat proteins) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811. Additional pharmaceutical formulations appropriate for administration are known in the art (see, e.g., Gennaro (ed.), Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20'hed., Lippincott, Williams &Willdns (2000); Ansel etal., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems. 7 th ed.Lippin¢ott Williams Wilkins Publishers (1999) Kibbe (ed.), Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients American Pharmaceutical Association. 3 rd ed. (2000); and Pharmaceutical Principles of Solid Dosage Forms, Technonic Publishing Co., Inc., Lancaster, Pa., (1993)). The pharmaceutical formulations can be packaged in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. "Dosage unit form" as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages treatment; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound(s) in association with a pharmaceutical carrier or excipient, calculated to produce a desired therapeutic effect.

In one embodiment, a method includes analyzing a biological sample for the presence of a histone H2A polypeptide that specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142 The presence of a histone H2A polypeptide that specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142 indicates the presence of a histone H2A polypeptide that specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142 in the subject or patient or patient. In various aspects, the screening is performed by detecting the presence of the histone H2A polypeptide, or nucleic acid that encodes the histone H2A polypeptide. The cell may be in vitro or in a subject or patient (e.g., a mammal such as a human), located in any tissue or organ. BecauseAgRM1 can be measured, the invention further provides methods for detecting levels or amounts ofAgRM1. Cell proliferative disorders screened or identified include benign hyperplasias and tumors, as set forth herein and known in the art. Tumors can be non-metastatic or metastatic: be in any stage (e.g., a stage I, II, III, IV or V tumor); be a solid (e.g., sarcoma, carcinoma, melanoma myelom& blastoma, glJoma, lymphoma or leukemia) or liquid(e.g.. reticuloendothelial orhematopoetic) tumor. Specific examples of cell proliferative disorders may.include cells are selected from or arise from breast, colon, gut, lung, brain, skin or pancreas. The invention moreover provides methods of inducing or increasing an immune response to a histone H2A polypeptide that specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142. In one embodiment, a method includes administering to a subject or patient a therapeuctically effective amount ofa histone H2A polypeptide that specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142 to elicit an immune response to the histone H2A polypeptide in the subject or patient. An immune response can include a cell-mediated or humoral immune response. The cell may be present in a subject or patient, for example, a mammal (e.g., human subject) having or at risk of having a cell-proliferative disorder. Thus, the invention also provides methods of treating a cell-proliferative cell disorder in a subject or patient, wherein at least a portion of the cells express AgRM1. In one embodiment, a method includes administering to a subject or patient a therapeutically effective amount of a histone H2A polypeptide that specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142 to treat the cell proliferative disorder. Exemplary cell proliferative disorders comprise cells selected or arising.from breast, colon, gut, lung, brain, skin or pancreas. As used herein, the term "proliferate," and grammatical variations thereof, when used in reference to a cell, tissue or organ, refers to undesirable, excessive or abnormal cell, tissue or organ proliferation, differentiation or survival. Cell proliferative and ditTerentiative disorders include diseases and physiological conditions, both benign and neoplastic, characterized by undesirable, excessive or abnormal cell numbers, cell growth or cell survival in a subject. Specific examples of such disorders include metastatic and non-metastatic tumors and cancers. Further provided are methods of treating a subject having or at risk ofhaving a tumor. In one embodiment, a method includes administering to a subject or patient a therapeutically effective amount of a histone H2A polypeptide that specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142 to treat the subject. In additional embodiment a method includes administering an anti cell-proliferative or immune systemenhancing treatment or therapy (e.g., an antibody, radioisotope, radiation, a toxic, immunotherapeutic or chemotherapeutic agent, immunotherapy, surgical resection, hyperthermia, vaccine orimmunogen), as set forth herein and known to one skilled in the art. The terms "lumor," "cancer," "malignancy," and "neoplasia" are used interchangeably herein and refer to a cell or population of cells of any cell or tissue origin, whose growth, proliferation or survival is greater than growth, proliferation or survival of a normal counterpart cell, e.g. a cell proliferative or differentiativedisorder. Such disorders include, for example, sarcoma carcinoma, melanoma, myelomablastomaneural (e.g.. glioma), and reticuloendothelial or haematopoietic neoplastic disorders (e.g., myeloma, lyrnphoma or leukemia). Tumors can arise from a multitude of primary tumor types, including but not limited to breast, lung, thyroid, head and neck, brain, lymphoid, gut or gastrointestinal (mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, rectum), genito-urinau: tract (uterus, ovary, cervix, bladder, testicle, penis, prostate), kidney, pancreas, liver, bone, muscle, skin, and may metastasize to secondary sites. Tumors can be non-metastatic or metastatic, and be in any stage, e.g., a stage I, II, III, IV or v tumor, or in remission. A "solid tumor" refers to neoplasia or metastasis that typically aggregates together and forms a mass. Specific examples include visceral tumors such as melanomas, breast, pancreatic, uterine and ovarian cancers, testicular cancer, including seminomas, gastric or colon cancer, hepatomas, adrenal, renal and bladder carcinomas, lung, head and neck cancers and brain tumors/cancers. Carcinomas refer to malignancies of epithelial or endocrine tissue, and include respiratory system carcinomas, gastrointestinal system carcinomas, genitourinary system carcinomas, testicular carcinomas, breast carcinomas, prostatic carcinomas, endocrine system carcinomas, and melanomas. The term also includes carcinosarcomas, e.g., which include malignant tumors composed of carcinomatous and sarcomatous tissues. Adenocarcinoma includes a carcinoma of a glandular tissue, or in which the tumor forms a gland like structure. Melanoma refers to malignant tumors ofmelanocytes and other cells derived from pigment cell origin that may arise in the skin, the eye (including retina), or other regions of the body, including the cells derived from the neural crest that also gives rise to the melanocyte lineage. Additional carcinomas can form from the uterine/cervix, lung, head/neck, colon, pancreas, testes, adrenal gland, kidney, esophagus, stomach, liver and ovary. Sarcomas refer to malignant tumors ofmesenchymal cell origin. Exemplary sarcomas include for example, lymphosarcoma, liposarcoma, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma. leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. Neural neoplasias include glioma, glioblastoma,meningioma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendrocytoma A "liquid tumor" refers to neoplasia of the reficuioendothelial or haematopoetic system, such as alymphoma, myeloma, orleukemia, or a neoplasia that is diffuse in nature. Particular examples ofleukemias include acute and chronic l.vmphoblastic, myeolblastic and multiple myeloma. Typically, such diseases arise from poorly differentiated acute leukemias, e.g.. e rythroblasfi c leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Specific myeloid disorders include, but are not limited to, acute promyeloid leukemia (APML), acutemyelogenous leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML): lymphoid malignancies include, but are not limited to, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which includes B-lineage ALL and T-lineage ALL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), hairy cell leukemi -lLL) andWaldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). Specific malignant lymphomas include, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and variants, peripheral T cell lymphomas, adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGF), Hodgkin's disease and Reed-Stemberg disease. Methods of the invention include providing a detectable or measurable improvement in the subjects condition: i.e., a therapeutic benefit. A therapeutic benefit is any objective or subjective for a transient period of time, temporary period of time, or any longer term improvement in the condition; or a reduction in the severity or adverse symptom of the condition. Thus, a satisfactory clinical endpoint is achieved when there is an incremental or a partial reduction in the severity, duration or frequency of one or more associated adverse symptoms or complications, or inhibition or reversal of one or more of the physiological, biochemical or cellular manifestations or characteristics of the condition. A therapeutic benefit or improvement ("ameliorate" is used synonymously) therefore need not be destruction of all target cells (e.g., tumor) or ablation of any particular symptom or complication or all adverse symptoms or complications associated with the disorder. For example, inhibiting an increase in tumor cell mass (stabilization of the tumor) can prolong lifespan even if only for a few days, weeks or months, even though some or the majority of the tumor remains. Stabilization may even provide benefits in reduction or stabization of symptoms without an increase of life expectancy. Specific non-limiting examples of therapeutic benefit include a reduction in tumor volume (size or cell mass), inhibiting an increase in tumor volume, slowing or inhibiting tumor progression or metastasis, stimulating tumor cell lysis, necrosis or apoptosis, and reducing tumor metastasis. Examination ofa biopsied sample containing a tumor (e.g., blood or tissue sample), can establish whether a reduction in numbers of tumor cells or inhibition of tumor cell proliferation has occurred. Alternatively. for a solid tumor, invasive and noninvasive imaging methods can ascertain a reduction in tumor size, or can ascertain inhibiting an increase in tumor size. Adverse symptoms and complications associated with tumor, neoplasia, and cancer that can be reduced or decreased include, for example, nausea, lack of appetite, lethargy, pain and discomfort. Thus, a reduction in the severity, duration or frequency of adverse symptoms, an improvement in the subjects subjective feeling, such as increased energy., appetite, and psychological well being, are all examples of therapeutic benefit. The doses or "sufficient amount" for treatment to achieve a therapeutic benefit or improvement are effective to ameliorate one, several or all adverse symptoms or complications of the condition, to a measurable or detectable extent. Preventing or inhibiting a progression or worsening of the disorder, condition or adverse symptom, is also a satisfactory outcome. Thus, in the case of a cell-proliferative condition or disorder, the amount will be sufficient to provide a therapeutic benefit to the subject or to ameliorate the condition or symptom. The dose may be proportionally increased or reduced as indicated by the status of the disease being treated or a side effect of the treatment. This is also referred to herein as an "therapeutically effective amount." Doses also considered effective are those that result in reduction of the use of another therapeutic regimen or protocol. For example, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with an H2A histone polypeptide of the invention if its administration results in lesschemotherapeutic drug, radiation or immunotherapy being required for tumor treatment. Of course, as is typical for treatment protocols, some subjects will exhibit greater or less response to treatment. For example, appropriate amounts will depend upon the condition treated (e.g., the tumor type or stage of the tumor), the therapeutic effect desired, as well as the individual subject (e.g, the bioavailabilily within the subject, gender, age, etc.). The H2A histone polypeptide of the inventions and nucleic acids can be administered in association with any other therapeutic regimen or treatment protocol. Other treatment protocols include drug treatment (chemotherapy), surgical resection, hyperthermia, radiotherapy, and immunetherapy, as set forth herein and known in the art. The invention therefore provides methods in which the H2A polypeptides and nucleic acids of the invention are used in combination with any anti-cell proliferative therapeutic regimen or treatment protocol, such as those set forth herein or known in the art. Radiotherapy includes internal or external delivery to a subject. For example, alpha, beta, gamma and X-rays can administered to the subject externally without the subject internalizing or otherwise physically contacting a radioisotope. Specific examples of X-ray dosages administered range from daily doses of 50 to 200 roentgens for prolonged periods of time (3 to 5/week). to single doses of 2000 to 6000 roentgens. Dosages vary widely, and depend on duration of exposure, the half-life of the isotope, the type of radiation emitted, the cell type and location treated and the progressive stage of the disease. The term "subject" refers to animals, typically mammalian animals, such as a nonhuman primate (gorillas. chimpanzees, orangutans, macaques, gibbons), a domestic animal (dogs and cats), a farm animal (horses, cows, goats, sheep, pigs), experimental animal (mouse, rat,rabbit, guinea pig) and humans. Subjects include disease model animals (e.g.. such as mice and non-human primates) for testing in vivo efficacy of the H2A polypeptides and nucleic acids of the invention (e.g., a tumor animal model). Human subjects include adults, and children, for example, newborns and older children, between the ages of 1 and 5, and 10 and 10 and 18 years. Subjects include humans having or at risk of having a cell-proliferative disorder, such as subjects having a cell or tissue that expresses AgRM !, or subjects that have a family history of, are genetically predisposed to, or have been previously afflicted with a hyperproliferative disorder Thus. subjects at risk for developing cancer can be identified with genetic screens for tumor associated genes, gene deletions or gene mutations. Subjects at risk for developing breast cancer lack BRCA 1, for example Subjects at risk for developing colon cancer have deleted or mutated tumor suppressor genes, such as adenomatous polyposis coil (APC), for example. Subjects include candidates for anti-tumor or immune system-enhancing therapy, or those that are undergoing or have undergone an anti cellproliferative or immune system-enhancing therapy (e.g., subjects in remission). Further provided are methods of screening for or identifying an inhibitor or stimulator of expression ofa histone H2A polvpeptide that specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142. In one embodiment, a method includes: contacting a cell that expresses or is capable of expressing histone H2A polypeptide that specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142 with a test compound; and detecting expression of said histone H2A polypeptide that specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-I 2142. A change in expression indicates that the test compound is an inhibitor or stimulator of expression of a histone H2A polypeptide that specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142. In various aspects, the contacting is in solution, in solid phase, in vivo or in vitro. Additionally provided are methods of screening for or identifying a subject having, or at risk of having, a cell proliferative disorder (e.g., a cell proliferative disorder in a tissue selected from breast, colon, gut, lung, brain, skin or pancreas). In one embodiment, a method includes: analyzing for the expression of a histone H2A polypeptide of about 19 kDa that specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-12142. The presence ofa histone H2A polypeptide of about | 9 kDa that specifically binds to a human monoclonal antibody produced by the cell line deposited as ATCC accession no. CRL-I 2142 in the tissue identifies the subject as having or at risk of having a cell proliferative disorder.
