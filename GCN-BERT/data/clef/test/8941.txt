Synthesis of 4-(azidomethyl)-N-[2-[2-(2-aminoethoxyl)ethoxy]ethyl]benzamide (25)
Succinimidyl 4-(azidomethyl)benzoate 21 (1.25 g, 4.56 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (30 mL), a solution obtained by dissolving 1,2-bis(2-aminoethoxy)ethane 24 (3.35 g, 22.8 mmol, 5.0 eq.) in dichloromethane (16 mL) was added dropwise with a dropping funnel, and the mixture was stirred. After 18 hours, the disappearance of the raw material was confirmed by TLC, and the reaction solution was distilled under reduced pressure. Then, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (chloroform:methanol=10:1+0.05% NH3 aq.→5:1+0.05% NH3 aq.→3:1+0.05% NH3 aq.) to obtain a compound 25 (0.97 g, 2.39 mmol, 52%) as an oil.
