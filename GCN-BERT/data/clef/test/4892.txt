Preparation of (1S,3R)-1-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-(2,2-difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine
5-Bromopicolinaldehyde (1172 mg, 6.30 mmol) was added to a solution of (R)-3-(2-((2,2-difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (817 mg, 3.00 mmol) in acetic acid (14.7 mL) and water (270 μL, 15.0 mmol) and the reaction was heated to 80° C. for 2 hours. After cooling, the volatiles were evaporated under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in DCM and washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution. The organic was evaporated to a volume ˜20 mL and 2N HCl solution (20 mL) was added. The biphasic mixture was stirred for 15 minutes, then separated. The organic was extracted with water, then the aqueous phase was back-extracted with DCM. The aqueous phase was then basified by addition of solid K2CO3, then extracted with DCM. The organic extracts were dried and evaporated. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 50% EtOAc in heptane. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford (1S,3R)-1-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-(2,2-difluoro-3-methoxypropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (810 mg, 61%) as a beige solid.
