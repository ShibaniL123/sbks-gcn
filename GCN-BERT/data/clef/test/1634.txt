DEPOSITION APPARATUS FOR DEPOSITION OF A MATERIAL ON A SUBSTRATE AND METHOD FOR DEPOSITING A MATERIAL ON A SUBSTRATE FIELD [0001] Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a deposition apparatus for deposition of a material on a substrate and to a method for depositing a material on a substrate. Embodiments of the present disclosure particularly relate to a sputtering apparatus for deposition of layer stacks on a substrate and to a method for depositing layer stacks on a substrate. BACKGROUND [0002] Touch panels such as touch screen panels are a particular class of electronic visual displays, which are able to detect and locate a touch within a display area. Touch panels include layer stacks or transparent bodies resulting in a functional screen (like a touch screen panel). However, an inferior sunlight readability, a colored appearance (reflectance) of the touch panel and a color change with respect to the produced picture from an underlying display, and a more or less visible pattern from the structured core layer of the functional screen (e.g. a patterned transparent conductive oxide, TCO) is often obtained. [0003] Different layer stack concepts are used in the manufacturing of touch panels. These layer stack concepts include for example a layer stack with an antireflective coating followed by a metal layer stack such as a Black Metal stack (e.g., for Black Metal Bridges or Black Metal Meshes). The layer stack concepts also include for example a layer stack with transparent insulating layers and a patterned TCO layer, e.g. a patterned indium tin oxide (ΠΌ) layer, such that the patterned TCO layer is invisible for a user ("invisible TCO" or "invisible (i-)ITO"). [0004] Manufacturers of touch panels have broad and changing product portfolios with the need to adapt quickly to a fast paced technological evolution. An easy and quick adaption of manufacturing equipment to different products, such as the above exemplary different layer stacks, is an aspect. As an example, in touch panel manufacturing a quick tool conversion from a layer stack with invisible TCO to a metal layer stack such as a Black Metal layer stack is beneficial. However, many of the process steps, for example in an in-line production tool, have space consuming gas separation units between adjacent process units and often separate deposition apparatuses are used for producing e.g. a layer stack with invisible TCO and a metal layer stack such as a Black Metal layer stack. [0005] In view of the above, a deposition apparatus for deposition of a material on a substrate and a method for depositing a material on a substrate, that overcome at least some of the problems in the art are needed. SUMMARY [0006] In light of the above, a deposition apparatus for deposition of a material on a substrate and a method for depositing a material on a substrate are provided. Further aspects, benefits, and features of the present disclosure are apparent from the claims, the description, and the accompanying drawings. [0007] According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a deposition apparatus for deposition of a material on a substrate is provided. The deposition apparatus includes two or more processing chambers including a first processing chamber and a second processing chamber; a substrate support extending at least through the first processing chamber and the second processing chamber; and two or more deposition source assemblies including a first deposition source assembly in the first processing chamber and a second deposition source assembly in the second processing chamber.

The at least one deposition source support is configured to be moveable at least between a first position and a second position. In the first position, the at least one first deposition source is oriented towards the substrate support, and, in the second position, the at least one process device is oriented towards the substrate support. [0008] According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a method for depositing a material on a substrate is provided. The method includes depositing a first layer stack on a first substrate by a first deposition source assembly and a second deposition source assembly; moving at least one of the first deposition source assembly and the second deposition source assembly from a first position into a second position; and depositing a second layer stack on a second substrate. [0009] According to still another aspect of the present disclosure, a deposition apparatus for deposition of a first layer stack on a first substrate and a second layer stack on a second substrate is provided, wherein the second layer stack is different from the first layer stack. The deposition apparatus includes two or more processing chambers including a first processing chamber and a second processing chamber; a substrate support extending at least through the first processing chamber and the second processing chamber; and two or more deposition source assemblies including a first deposition source assembly in the first processing chamber and a second deposition source assembly in the second processing chamber.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS [0012] Reference will now be made in detail to the various embodiments of the disclosure, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the figures. Within the following description of the drawings, the same reference numbers refer to same components. Generally, only the differences with respect to individual embodiments are described. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the disclosure and is not meant as a limitation of the disclosure. Further, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used on or in conjunction with other embodiments to yield yet a further embodiment. It is intended that the description includes such modifications and variations. [0013] Manufacturers of touch panels have broad and changing product portfolios with the need to adapt quickly to a fast paced technological evolution. An easy and quick adaption of manufacturing equipment to different products, such as different layer stacks, is an aspect. As an example, in touch panel manufacturing a quick tool conversion from invisible ΓΓΟ stacks to metal stacks such as Black Metal stacks for Black Metal Bridges or Black Metal Meshes is needed. [0014] The present disclosure provides a deposition apparatus for deposition of a material on a substrate. The deposition apparatus includes two or more processing chambers including a first processing chamber and a second processing chamber; a substrate support extending at least through the first processing chamber and the second processing chamber; and two or more deposition source assemblies including a first deposition source assembly in the first processing chamber and a second deposition source assembly in the second processing chamber. Each of the two or more deposition source assemblies includes at least one deposition source support configured to support at least one first deposition source and at least one process device. The at least one deposition source support is configured to be moveable at least between a first position and a second position. In the first position, the at least one first deposition source is oriented towards the substrate support, and, in the second position, the at least one process device is oriented towards the substrate support. [0015] According to some embodiments, the disclosure provides a deposition apparatus configured as a flip source type equipment configuration with deposition sources (e.g., deposition units), which allow changing the deposition source(s)/deposition material(s) (e.g., cathode(s)/cathode material(s) within a processing chamber (e.g., the deposition unit) in-situ such that one in-line system can provide for two or more layer stacks (i.e., stack concepts) with different materials with a reduced need of venting or even without the need of venting. In some implementations, e.g. for touch panels, the system can be flipped from one configuration providing for a 3 layer stack to produce ITO with pattern invisibility ("Invisible ITO") to another configuration providing a conductive antireflective coating followed by a metal stack such as a "Black Metal"-stack. Such a metal stack can be used for low-reflective, invisible "Black Metal Bridges" (OGS ("one glass solution") / TOL ("touch on lens") concept for out-cell touch screen panels (TSPs)) and contact out metal leads for on-cell type TSPs Metal Mesh based touch screen panels approaches. [0016] The deposition source assembly (e.g., a flip unit) can provide on one side the at least one first deposition source assembly (e.g., a cathode(s) source unit) and on the other side a process device such as at least one second deposition source assembly (e.g., another cathode(s) source unit) or other functional units such as a gas separation, a heating, a conditioning or a combination thereof. [0017] The term "substrate" as used herein shall embrace substrates, which can be used for display manufacturing, such as glass or plastic substrates. For example, substrates as described herein shall embrace substrates, which can be used for an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), a PDP (Plasma Display Panel), and the like. Unless explicitly specified otherwise in the description, the term "substrate" is to be understood as "large area substrate" as specified herein. [0018] According to some embodiments, large area substrates or respective carriers, wherein the carriers have one or more substrates, may have a size of at least 0.67 m2. Typically, the size can be about 0.67m2 (0.73x0.92m - Gen 4.5) to about 8 m2, more typically about 2 m2 to about 9 m2 or even up to 12 m2. Typically, the substrates or carriers, for which the structures and methods according to embodiments described herein are provided, are large area substrates as described herein. For instance, a large area substrate or carrier can be GEN 4.5, which corresponds to about 0.67 m2 substrates (0.73x0.92m), GEN 5, which corresponds to about 1.4 m2 substrates (1.1 m x 1.3 m), GEN 7.5, which corresponds to about 4.29 m2 substrates (1.95 m x 2.2 m), GEN 8.5, which corresponds to about 5.7m2 substrates (2.2 m x 2.5 m), or even GEN 10, which corresponds to about 8.7 m2 substrates (2.85 m x 3.05 m). Even larger generations such as GEN 11 and GEN 12 and corresponding substrate areas can similarly be implemented. [0019] The term "substrate" as used herein shall also embrace flexible substrates such as a web or a foil. [0020] The term "transparent" as used herein shall particularly include the capability of a structure to transmit light with relatively low scattering, so that, for example, light transmitted therethrough can be seen in a substantially clearly manner. [0021] According to some embodiments, a layer stack is constituted by a number of layers or films formed (e.g., by deposition) one atop or over of another. In particular, embodiments herein include depositing a layer stack which may include at least one of a metal layer, a transparent insulating layer and/or a transparent conductive oxide layer such as an ITO layer. When reference is made to the term "over", i.e. one layer being over the other, it is understood that, starting from the substrate, a first layer is deposited over the substrate, and a further layer, deposited after the first layer, is thus over the first layer and over the substrate. In other words, the term "over" is used to define an order of layers, layer stacks, and/or films wherein the starting point is the substrate. [0022] According to some embodiments, which can be combined with other embodiments described herein, the deposition apparatus is configured to deposit at least a first layer stack and a second layer stack, particularly wherein the second layer stack is different from the first layer stack. The first layer stack and the second layer stack may include different materials or material layers. In exemplary implementations, the deposition apparatus is configured to deposit the first layer stack including at least one of indium tin oxide (ITO) and NbyOx, Nb2C"5, Si02, Ti02 and/or a metal, particularly Al, Mo and Cu, and/or the deposition apparatus is configured to deposit the second layer stack including at least one of MoNbOxNy, Al, AINd and MoNb or other alloys of Mo and Al.

[0025] An atmosphere in one or more of the first vacuum chambers and/or in the second vacuum chambers can be individually controlled by generating a technical vacuum, for example with vacuum pumps 150 connected to at least some of the first vacuum chambers and the second vacuum chambers. As an example, the atmosphere can be individually controlled by generating a technical vacuum and/or by inserting process gases in deposition regions in the first processing chamber 112 and/or the second processing chamber 122. [0026] A first substrate support 130, e.g. configured for transporting or conveying the substrate or a first carrier having the substrate disposed thereon, extends through the first portion 110, and a second substrate support 140, e.g. configured for transporting or conveying the substrate or a second carrier having the substrate disposed thereon, extends through the second portion 120.

For depositing the metal layer stack, the substrate to be processed can be inserted into the first processing chamber 112 via the first entry load lock chamber 111. The metal layers including e.g. MoNbOxNy and Al are deposited on the substrate, and the substrate exits the deposition apparatus 100 through the first exit load lock chamber 113.

The transfer chamber 240 may include substrate transport means configured for transferring or transporting the substrate from the first portion 210, particularly from the first processing chamber 212, into the second portion 220, particularly the second processing chamber 222. [0034] An atmosphere in at least one of the first vacuum chambers, the second vacuum chambers and the further vacuum chambers such as the transfer chamber 240 can be individually controlled by generating a technical vacuum, for example with vacuum pumps 250 connected to one or more of the first vacuum chambers, the second vacuum chambers and the further vacuum chambers such as the transfer chamber 240. As an example, the atmosphere can be individually controlled by generating a technical vacuum and/or by inserting process gases in deposition regions in the first processing chamber 212 and/or in the second processing chamber 222. [0035] A first substrate support 230, e.g. configured for transporting or conveying the substrate or a first carrier on which the substrate is disposed, extends through the first portion 210. A second substrate support 280, e.g. configured for transporting or conveying the substrate or a second carrier on which the substrate is disposed, extends through the second portion 220.

The second separation wall 364 can be configured to separate the second processing chamber 320 into a first chamber portion 321 of the second processing chamber 320 and a second chamber portion 322 of the second processing chamber 320. [0053] In some implementations, the first chamber portion (e.g., the first chamber portion 311 of the first processing chamber 310 and the first chamber portion 321 of the second processing chamber 320) and the second chamber portion (e.g., the second chamber portion 312 of the first processing chamber 310 and the second chamber portion 322 of the second processing chamber 320) are portions with different partial pressures and/or kind of gases such as process gases. According to some embodiments, the first chamber portion includes the substrate support, and the second chamber portion is a storage portion e.g. for storing the at least one first deposition source or the at least one process device when the at least one first deposition source or the at least one process device are not oriented towards the substrate support. As an example, in the first position, the at least one first deposition source is positioned in the first chamber portion and the at least one process device is in the second chamber portion, and, in the second position, the at least one process device is the first chamber portion and the at least one first deposition source is positioned in the second chamber portion. The second chamber portion may be a storage portion. [0054] According to some embodiments, which can be combined with other embodiments described herein, the second chamber portion can have a vacuum lock or a door. The vacuum lock or door can be opened e.g. for maintenance, repair or exchange of the at least one first deposition source or the at least one process device positioned in the second processing chamber. In some implementations, opening the vacuum lock or door for maintenance, repair or exchange of the at least one first deposition source or the at least one process device can be done during a deposition process, since the at least one first deposition source or the at least one process device positioned in the second chamber portion is inactive or not in use, while the at least one process device or the at least one first deposition source positioned in the first chamber portion can be operated. This reduces a down time of the deposition apparatus for maintenance, repair or exchange e.g. of the at least one first deposition source or the at least one process device. [0055] In some implementations, the two or more deposition source assemblies are configured for flipping the deposition sources such as cathode(s) and for easy installation (e.g. on tracks for removing and re-positioning doors at the deposition apparatus). Exemplarily, the two or more deposition source assemblies are configured for flipping the deposition sources such as cathode(s) within a designated processing chamber, while maintaining simultaneously the capability to remove the currently not used deposition sources with a reduced need of venting or even without the need of venting the deposition apparatus or the processing chamber of the deposition apparatus (additional vacuum locks between deposition sources or process devices in the second chamber portion (e.g., external/additional cathode(s)) and deposition sources or process devices in the first chamber portion (e.g., internal cathode(s)) can be provided in the deposition apparatus. [0056] According to some embodiments, which can be combined with other embodiments described herein, the separation wall is configured to hermetically seal the first chamber portion from the second chamber portion. In some embodiments, the separation wall is configured as a gas separation shielding. The first chamber portion and the second chamber portion may be portions with different partial pressures and/or kind of gases such as process gases. The process gases can include inert gases such as argon and/or reactive gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, Hydrogen (H2) and ammonia (NH3), Ozone (03), activated gases or the like. [0057] The term "hermetically" as used herein refers to a substantially airtight sealing. The sealing may be impervious to gases such as the process gases. As an example, the first separation wall 354 is configured to hermetically seal the first chamber portion 311 of the first processing chamber 310 from the second chamber portion 312 of the first processing chamber 310. The second separation wall 364 can be configured to hermetically seal the first chamber portion 321 of the second processing chamber 320 from the second chamber portion 322 of the second processing chamber 320. [0058] Figure 4 shows a schematic view of another deposition apparatus 400 for deposition of a material on a substrate 340 according to embodiments described herein. According to some embodiments, the deposition apparatus 400 is configured for depositing two or more different layer stacks, e.g., a first layer stack and a second layer stack with different materials. [0059] The difference between the deposition apparatus 300 of figure 3 and the deposition apparatus 400 of figure 4 lies in the configuration of the first deposition source assembly in the first processing chamber and the second deposition source assembly in the second processing chamber. A description of the features described above with reference to figure 3 also applies to the corresponding features of the embodiment shown in figure 4 and is not repeated. [0060] In some implementations, the at least one process device includes at least one of at least one second deposition source, a heating device and a deposition source conditioning device. In figure 4, the first deposition source assembly 450 includes the deposition source support, e.g., the first deposition source support 351, at least one first deposition source, such as a first single deposition source 452, and at least one process device, such as a first deposition source pair 453. The second deposition source assembly 460 includes the deposition source support, e.g., the second deposition source support 361, at least one first deposition source, such as a second single deposition source 462, and at least one process device, such as a heating device and/or a deposition source conditioning device. [0061] Although in figures 3 and 4 a first processing chamber and a second processing chamber are shown, the present disclosure is not limited to the provision of two processing chambers. According to some embodiments, which can be combined with other embodiments described herein, the two or more processing chambers include one or more further processing chambers, wherein at least one further deposition source assembly is provided in at least one of the one or more further processing chambers. As an example, any number of processing chambers can be provided, for instance at least 3, and specifically at least 10 processing chambers. [0062] According to some embodiments, which can be combined with other embodiments described herein, the deposition apparatus further includes a controller configured for controlling a movement or rotation of the at least one deposition source support between the first position and the second position. When the apparatus provides the two or more configurations of the orientations of the respective deposition source supports of the two or more deposition source assemblies, the controller can be configured to chamber between the two or more configurations. As an example, the controller can be configured to change between the first configuration for depositing the first layer stack the second configuration for depositing the second layer stack. The present disclosure is not limited to the provision of two configurations. Further configurations for deposition one or more additional layer stacks or layer stack concepts can be provided. [0063] The deposition apparatus providing the two or more configurations allow changing the deposition source(s)/deposition material(s) (e.g., cathode(s)/cathode material(s) within a processing chamber (e.g., a deposition unit) in-situ such that one inline system can provide for two or more layer stacks (i.e., stack concepts) with different materials with a reduced need of venting or even without the need of venting. [0064] Figure 5 shows a schematic view of still another deposition apparatus 500 for deposition of a material on a substrate according to embodiments described herein. According to some embodiments, the deposition apparatus 500 is configured for depositing two or more different layer stacks, e.g., a first layer stack and a second layer stack with different materials. [0065] In figure 5, the deposition apparatus 500 is in a first configuration for deposition of a first layer stack being e.g. a layer stack with one or more transparent insulating layers and at least one transparent conductive oxide layer (TCO) layer, e.g. an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer (e.g., "invisible ΙΤΟ")· According to some embodiments, the at least one TCO layer can be a structured TCO layer and can be provided by e.g. depositing a TCO layer and patterning the TCO layer in order to provide the structured TCO layer. Alternatively, a mask and/or a photoresist can be provided to deposit the structured TCO layer. [0066] According to some embodiments, which can be combined with other embodiments described herein, the at least one TCO layer can include at least one of an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, a doped ITO layer, impurity-doped ZnO, ln203, Sn02 and CdO, ITO (In203:Sn), AZO (ZnO:Al), IZO (ZnO: In), GZO (ZnO:Ga), or multi- component oxides including or consisting of combinations of ZnO, ln203, SnZnO and Sn02, or combinations thereof. In the following, reference is made to ΓΓΟ as an example for the at least one TCO layer. [0067] Exemplarily, in figure 5 the deposition apparatus 500 includes a first portion 510 for deposition of the one or more transparent insulating layers of the first layer stack and a second portion 540 for deposition of the at least one ITO layer. The first portion 510 and the second portion 540 can be separated by a separation wall 520. The first portion 510 includes a plurality of first vacuum chambers and the second portion 540 includes a plurality of second vacuum chambers. According to some implementations, the first vacuum chambers and the second vacuum chambers can be separated from adjacent first vacuum chambers and second vacuum chambers, respectively, by separation devices 590. As an example, the separation device 590 can include a valve having a valve housing and a valve unit. The separation device 590 may be configured as a load lock between adjacent first vacuum chambers and adjacent second vacuum chambers. [0068] According to some embodiments, which can be combined with other embodiments described herein, the first vacuum chambers and the second vacuum chambers may be chambers selected from the group consisting of: a buffer chamber, a heating chamber, a transfer chamber, a cycle-time-adjusting chamber, a deposition chamber, a processing chamber or the like. According to embodiments, which can be combined with other embodiments described herein, a "processing chamber" may be understood as a chamber in which a processing device for processing a substrate is arranged. The processing device may be understood as any device used for processing a substrate. For example, the processing device may include a deposition source for depositing a layer onto the substrate. Accordingly, the vacuum chamber or processing chamber including the e.g. a deposition source assembly may also be referred to as a deposition chamber. The processing chamber may be a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) chamber or a physical vapor deposition (PVD) chamber. According to some embodiments, which can be combined with other embodiments described herein, the two or more processing chambers can be vacuum processing chambers. [0069] At least some of the first vacuum chambers and the second vacuum chambers can be configured as processing chambers. As an example, at least some of the first vacuum chambers and the second vacuum chambers configured as processing chambers can each include at least one deposition source assembly. The at least one deposition source assembly can include at least one deposition source, such as a first deposition source and/or a second deposition source. The deposition sources can for example be rotatable cathodes having targets of the material to be deposited on the substrate. The cathodes can be rotatable cathodes with a magnetron therein. As an example, magnetron sputtering can be conducted for depositing of the layers of the layer stacks, e.g. the first layer stack and the second layer stack. As an example, the cathodes are connected to an AC power supply (not shown), such that the cathodes can be biased in an alternating manner. [0070] As used herein, "magnetron sputtering" refers to sputtering performed using a magnet assembly, that is, a unit capable of a generating a magnetic field. As an example, such a magnet assembly consists of a permanent magnet. This permanent magnet can be arranged within a rotatable target or coupled to a planar target in a manner such that the free electrons are trapped within the generated magnetic field generated below the rotatable target surface. Such a magnet assembly may also be arranged coupled to a planar cathode. [0071] Magnetron sputtering can be realized by a double magnetron cathode, i.e. a pair of the deposition sources, such as, but not limited to, a TwinMagTM cathode assembly. Particularly, for MF sputtering e.g. from a silicon target, target assemblies including double cathodes can be applied. According to some embodiments, the deposition sources in a processing chamber may be interchangeable. Accordingly, the deposition sources or targets are changed after the material has been consumed. [0072] According to some embodiments, layers such as transparent insulating layers can be deposited by sputtering, for example magnetron sputtering, of rotatable cathodes having an AC power supply. As an example, MF sputtering can be applied for depositing the transparent insulating layers. According to some embodiments, sputtering from a silicon target, e.g. a sprayed silicon target, is conducted by MF sputtering, that is middle frequency sputtering. According to embodiments herein, middle frequency is a frequency in the range 5 kHz to 100 kHz, for example, 10 kHz to 50 kHz. [0073] Sputtering from a target for a transparent conductive oxide film such as ITO can be conducted as DC sputtering. The respective deposition sources are connected to a DC power supply (not shown) together with anodes (not shown) collecting electrons during sputtering. According to embodiments, which can be combined with other embodiments described herein, the transparent conductive oxide layers, for example, the ITO layers, can be sputtered by DC sputtering. [0074] According to some embodiments, the first vacuum chambers of the first portion 510 can include an entry load lock chamber 511, a first processing chamber 512, a second processing chamber 513, a third processing chamber 514, a fourth processing chamber 515, and a fifth processing chamber 516. According to some embodiments, the second vacuum chambers of the second portion 540 can include a sixth processing chamber 541, a seventh processing chamber 542, an eighth processing chamber 543, a ninth processing chamber 544, a tenth processing chamber 545, and an exit load lock chamber 546. [0075] The deposition apparatus 500 may include further vacuum chambers such as a transfer chamber 530 connecting the first portion 510 and the second portion 540. The transfer chamber 530 may include substrate transport means configured for transferring or transporting the substrate from the first portion 510, particularly from the fifth processing chamber 516, into the second portion 540, and particularly into the sixth processing chamber 541. The substrate transport means may include means for turning or rotating the substrate. [0076] An atmosphere in one or more of the first vacuum chambers, the second vacuum chambers and/or the further vacuum chambers such as the transfer chamber 530 can be individually controlled by generating a technical vacuum, for example with vacuum pumps (not shown) connected to one or more of the first vacuum chambers, the second vacuum chambers and the further vacuum chambers such as the transfer chamber 530. As an example, the atmosphere can be individually controlled by generating a technical vacuum inside at least one of the entry load lock chamber 511, the processing chambers 512-516 and 541-545, the further vacuum chambers such as the transfer chamber 530, and the exit load lock chamber 546, and/or by inserting process gases e.g. in deposition regions of at least one of the processing chambers 512-516 and 541-545. The process gas can include inert gases such as argon and/or reactive gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, Hydrogen (H2) and ammonia (NH3), Ozone (03), activated gases or the like. [0077] A first substrate support 560, e.g. configured for supporting and transporting or conveying the substrate or a first carrier having the substrate disposed thereon, extends through the first portion 510, and a second substrate support 561, e.g. configured for supporting and transporting or conveying the substrate or a second carrier having the substrate disposed thereon, extends through the second portion 540. A transport direction of the substrate (not shown) through the first portion 510 is indicated with arrow 562 and a transport direction of the substrate (not shown) through the second portion 540 is indicated with arrow 563. In the transfer chamber 530, the substrate may be transferred from the first substrate support 560 to the second substrate support 561. The first substrate support 560 and the second substrate support 561 can be connected in the transfer chamber 530, e.g. by the substrate transport means. [0078] In the first portion 510, at least one first deposition source assembly 570 can be provided in the first processing chamber 512. The first deposition source assembly 570 can be configured as any one of the deposition source assemblies described above with reference to figures 3 and 4. The first deposition source assembly 570 can include a deposition source support 587, a separation wall 588, a NbOx deposition source pair 576 and a first MoNb deposition source pair 577. The NbOx deposition source pair 576 is oriented towards the first substrate support 560 for deposition e.g. of a Nb205 layer over the substrate, and the first MoNb deposition source pair 577 is in an inactive or stored position, e.g., in the second chamber portion of the first processing chamber 512.

[0081] In the first portion 510, the second processing chamber 513 and the third processing chamber 514 may each have a gas separation shielding. The gas separation shielding may have a slit opening for allowing a passage of the substrate therethrough. [0082] In the second portion 540, at least one fourth deposition source assembly 573 can be provided in the eighth processing chamber 543. The fourth deposition source assembly 573 can be configured as any one of the deposition source assemblies described above with reference to figures 3 and 4. The fourth deposition source assembly 573 can include the deposition source support 587, the separation wall 588, a process device 581 such as a heating device and/or a deposition source conditioning device, and an Al single deposition source 582. The process device 581 is oriented towards the second substrate support 561 e.g. for heating the substrate and/or layers deposited on the substrate, and the Al single deposition source 582 is in an inactive or stored position, e.g., in the second chamber portion of the eighth processing chamber 543. [0083] At least one fifth deposition source assembly 574 can be provided in the ninth processing chamber 544. The fifth deposition source assembly 574 can be configured as any one of the deposition source assemblies described above with reference to figures 3 and 4. The fifth deposition source assembly 574 can include the deposition source support 587, the separation wall 588, a first ITO deposition source pair 583, and an Al deposition source pair 584. The first ΠΌ deposition source pair 583 is oriented towards the second substrate support 561 e.g. for depositing an ITO layer over the substrate, and the Al deposition source pair 584 is in an inactive or stored position, e.g., in the second chamber portion of the ninth processing chamber 544. [0084] At least one sixth deposition source assembly 575 can be provided in the tenth processing chamber 545. The sixth deposition source assembly 575 can be configured as any one of the deposition source assemblies described above with reference to figures 3 and 4. The sixth deposition source assembly 575 can include the deposition source support 587, the separation wall 588, a second ITO deposition source pair 585, and a MoNb or Mo single deposition source 586. The second ITO deposition source pair 585 is oriented towards the second substrate support 561 e.g. for depositing an ITO layer over the substrate, and the MoNb or Mo single deposition source 586 is in an inactive or stored position, e.g., in the second chamber portion of the tenth processing chamber 545. [0085] In this example the sixth processing chamber 541 and the seventh processing chamber 542 do each not include a deposition source assembly. However, the present disclosure is not limited thereto and further deposition sources assemblies could be provided in the sixth processing chamber 541 and the seventh processing chamber 542 in order to realize further or different layer stack concepts. [0086] In some implementations, at least one pressure sensor (not shown) can be provided in at least one of the processing chambers 512-516 and 541-545. The at least one pressure sensor may be configured to measure a (partial) pressure of the process gas. The at least one pressure sensor may particularly be a oxygen pressure sensors or a nitrogen pressure sensor. Some of the layers as described herein can be oxide-layers, nitrite-layers, or oxinitride-layers, and can be deposited by a reactive deposition process where the target material reacts with oxygen and/or nitrogen after the material has been released from the target. By providing the pressure sensors, an atmosphere with an appropriate processing gas and/or the appropriate degree of technical vacuum can be provided in the respective processing chambers, and particularly in the deposition areas of the respective processing chambers. [0087] According to some embodiments, the process gases can include inert gases such as argon and/or reactive gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, Hydrogen (H2) and ammonia (NH3), Ozone (03), activated gases or the like. [0088] The deposition apparatus 500 with the first configuration shown in figure 5 can be configured for deposition of the first layer stack including the transparent insulating layers such as Nb205 and Si02 layers, and the at least one ITO layer. For depositing the first layer stack, the substrate to be processed can be inserted into the entry load lock chamber 511 and can be transported through the processing chambers 512-516 to deposit the transparent insulating layers such as Nb205 and Si02 layers over the substrate. Afterwards, the substrate enters the transfer chamber 530 where it is transferred from the first substrate support 560 to the second substrate support 561. Subsequently, for depositing the at least one ITO layer, the substrate having the transparent insulating layers such as Nb205 and Si02 layers processed thereon is inserted into the second portion 540, particularly the sixth processing chamber 541. The substrate is transported through the processing chambers 541-545 to deposit the at least one ITO layer (and optionally at least one metal layer). The substrate having the first layer stack including the transparent insulating layers such as Nb205 and Si02 layers, the at least one ITO layer and optionally the at least one metal layer processed thereon exits the deposition apparatus 500 through the exit load lock chamber 546. [0089] According to some embodiments, the first configuration for depositing the first layer stack as described above can be changed into the second configuration depositing the second layer stack e.g. by moving or rotating one or more of the deposition source supports of the two or more deposition source assemblies. In the example of figure 5, in order to change from the first configuration to the second configuration, the deposition source supports of each of the first to sixth deposition source assemblies can be rotated about 180 degrees. The deposition apparatus 500 with the second configuration can be configured for deposition of the second layer stack including a metal layer stack such as e.g. a Black Metal stack (e.g., for Black Metal Bridges or Black Metal Meshes) and optionally at least one TCO layer such as an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer. [0090] For depositing the second layer stack, the substrate to be processed can be inserted into the entry load lock chamber 511 and can be transported through the processing chambers 512-516 to deposit at least one first metal layer of the metal layer stack, such as at least one MoNbOxNy layer, on the substrate. Afterwards, the substrate enters the transfer chamber 530 where it is transferred from the first substrate support 560 to the second substrate support 561. Subsequently, the substrate having the at least one first metal layer processed thereon is inserted into the second portion 540, particularly the sixth processing chamber 541. The substrate is transported through the processing chambers 541-547 to deposit at least one second metal layer of the metal layer stack, such as at least one Al layer and/or at least one AINd layer, and at least one third metal layer of the metal layer stack, such as a Mo or MoNb layer. The substrate having the second layer stack processed thereon exits the deposition apparatus 500 through the exit load lock chamber 546. [0091] According to still another aspect of the present disclosure, a deposition apparatus for deposition of a first layer stack on a first substrate and a second layer stack on a second substrate is provided, wherein the second layer stack is different from the first layer stack. The deposition apparatus includes two or more processing chambers including a first processing chamber and a second processing chamber; a substrate support extending at least through the first processing chamber and the second processing chamber; and two or more deposition source assemblies including a first deposition source assembly in the first processing chamber and a second deposition source assembly in the second processing chamber. Each of the two or more deposition source assemblies includes at least one deposition source support configured to support at least one first deposition source and at least one process device, wherein the at least one process device includes at least one of at least one second deposition source, a heating device and a deposition source conditioning device; and a separation wall configured for separating the at least one first deposition source from the at least one process device. The at least one deposition source support is configured to be moveable at least between a first position and a second position. In the first position, the first deposition source is oriented towards the substrate support, and, in the second position, the at least one process device is oriented towards the substrate support. [0092] Figure 6 shows a flow chart of a method 600 for deposition of a material on a substrate according to embodiments described herein. [0093] According to some embodiments, the method 600 includes depositing a first layer stack on a first substrate by a first deposition source assembly and a second deposition source assembly (block 610); moving at least one of the first deposition source assembly and the second deposition source assembly from a first position into a second position (block 620); and depositing a second layer stack on a second substrate (block 630). The first layer stack and the second layer stack may at least in part include different materials. [0094] According to some embodiments, each of the first deposition source assembly and the second deposition source assembly includes at least one first deposition source and at least one process device, and wherein, in the first position, the first deposition source is oriented towards the substrate, and, in the second position, the at least one process device is oriented towards the substrate. [0095] According to embodiments described herein, the method for depositing a material on a substrate can be conducted by means of computer programs, software, computer software products and the interrelated controllers, which can have a CPU, a memory, a user interface, and input and output means being in communication with the corresponding components of the apparatus for processing a large area substrate. [0096] According to some embodiments, the disclosure provides a deposition apparatus configured as a flip source type equipment configuration with deposition sources, e.g., deposition units, which allows changing the deposition source(s)/deposition material(s) (e.g., cathode(s)/cathode material(s) within a processing chamber (e.g., the deposition unit) in-situ such that one in-line system can provide for two or more layer stacks (i.e., stack concepts) with different materials with a reduced need of venting or even without the need of venting. In some implementations, e.g. for touch panels, the system can be shifted, switched or flipped from one configuration providing for a 3 layer stack to produce ITO with pattern invisibility ("Invisible ITO") to another configuration providing a conductive antireflective coating followed by a metal stack such as a "Black Metal"- stack. Such a metal stack can be used for low-reflective, invisible "Black Metal Bridges" (OGS/TOL concept for out-cell touch screen panels (TSPs)) and contact out metal leads for on-cell type TSPs Metal Mesh based touch screen panels approaches. Generally, for all sequentially placed processing chambers with adjacent processes which have space consuming gas separations, this concept can be beneficial, since a space for the deposition apparatus is reduced, e.g., about 45%. Also switches can be used for adapting or changing the configuration of the deposition apparatus, and a number of power supplies is reduced, i.e., no additional power supplies need to be provided. [0097] According to the present disclosure, the deposition apparatus is multi-functional and only one deposition apparatus is provided for multiple stack concepts. The deposition apparatus is simple and allows a fast switching between stacks to be deposited. The deposition apparatus can support PCT ("projected capacitive touch") touch screen panel technology evolution from invisible ΓΓΟ (also including a Black Metal Bridge) to Black Metal Mesh. The present embodiments can be applied for systems providing for a set of various layers of different material, e.g. different metals and metal oxides. Also, a simple and fast in-situ switching between deposition sources (such as cathode(s)) is possible. The present embodiments can be applied / adjusted to different platform configurations e.g. depending on layer stack concepts. The present disclosure is e.g. usable for processing chambers for easy and fast deposition source or deposition source material exchange. Customers can be supported in product development stage with a flexible tool that can also be used for transition to HVM ("high volume manufacturing").
