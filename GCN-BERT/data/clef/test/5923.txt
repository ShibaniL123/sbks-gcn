SUBSTITUTED 3-BENZOFURANYL-INDOL-2-ONE-3- ACETAMIDOPIPERAZINE DERIVATIVES, PREPARATION THEREOF, AND THERAPEUTIC USE THEREOF The present invention relates to substituted 3-benzofuranyl-indol-2-one-3-acetamidopiperazine derivatives, to their preparation and to their therapeutic application. Ghrelin is a 28 amino-acid peptide hormone produced mainly in the stomach by a post-translational process after cleavage of pre-pro-ghrelin (Kojima Μ., et al., Nature 1999; 402: 656-60). Ghrelin is an endogenous ligand of the growth hormone secretagogue pituitary receptor (GHSRIa). GHS-R is encoded by two exons: exon 1 encodes the transmembrane domains (TMs) 1-5 and exon 2 encodes ΤΜ6 and 7 of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). The two transcripts have been identified in the pituitary gland and the brain: one encoding the full-length GPCR (GHS-R1a) and the other encoding a truncated receptor (GHS-R1b) lacking ΤΜ6 and 7. Only the subtype GHSRIa is activated by ghrelin and ghrelin mimetics. GHS-R1b is present in the liver and other peripheral tissues, but its function is unknown (Smith R.G. et al., Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism, 2005, 16, No. 9). It is a receptor of rhodopsin type, with seven transmembrane domains of family A coupled to Gq/phospholipase C. The ghrelin receptor may also be coupled to the Gs/protein kinase A pathways in certain tissues (Ueno, Ν. et al., Endocrinology, 2004, 145, 4176-4184; Kim, M.S. et al., Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab. Disord., 2004, 28: 1264-1271). Interestingly, the ghrelin receptor has the relatively uncommon characteristic of having significant ligandindependent constitutive activity (Barazzoni, R. et al., Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab., 2004, 288: Ε228-Ε235). Low levels of expression of ghrelin have been documented in various tissues, such as the intestines, the pancreas, the kidneys, the immune system, the placenta, the testicles, pituitary tissue and the hypothalamus (Horm. Res. 2003; 59 (3): 109-17). It has been demonstrated that ghrelin is involved in hunger at mealtimes, and in the initiation of meals. The circulating levels decreases with the intake of food and increase after meals, reaching concentrations that are sufficient to stimulate hunger and the intake of food. Ingestion of ghrelin stimulates food intake rapidly and transiently, mainly by increasing the appetitive feeding behaviour and the number of meals. Ghrelin stimulates the short-term taking of food more efficiently than any other molecule, with the exception of neuropeptide Υ, with which it is approximately equipotent (Wren Α.Μ. et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 2001 ; 86: 5992-5). However, ghrelin is unique in its capacity to exert this effect, whether it is injected peripherally or centrally. It is also the only mammalian substance that has demonstrated its capacity to increase the appetite and the taking of food when it is administered to humans (Druce M.R., et al., Int. J. Obes., 2005; 29: 1130-6; Wynne Κ., et al., J. Am. Soc. Nephrol., 2005; 16:2111 -8). Beyond its role in the initiation of meals, ghrelin also satisfies the established criteria of an adiposity-related hormone involved in regulating the long-term body mass. The levels of ghrelin circulate as a function of the energy reserves and display compensatory changes in response to changes in body mass. Ghrelin crosses the blood-brain barrier and stimulates the taking of food by acting on certain standard body mass-regulating centres, such as the hypothalamus, the hindbrain and the mesolimbic compensatory system. Chronic administration of ghrelin increases the body mass via diverse concerted actions on the taking of food, energy expenditure and the utilisation of resources. Congenital ablation of ghrelin or of the ghrelin receptor gene causes a resistance to feeding-induced obesity, and pharmacological blocking of ghrelin reduces the intake of food and the body mass. The existing evidence appears to favour the role of ghrelin both in the short-term initiation of meals and long-term energy homeostasis, thus making it an attractive target as a medicament for treating obesity and/or slimming disorders. Ghrelin also exerts both physiological and pharmacological actions on the endocrine pancreas. Acylated bioactive ghrelin is produced in the ε cells, recently described in the pancreatic islets (Prado, C.L., et al., 2004, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 101: 2924-2929), potentially providing a local source of ghrelin that acts on the β cells of the islets. Blockage of this function of endogenous ghrelin by means of an antagonist for its receptors substantially reduced the fasted glucose concentrations, attenuated the glycaemic movement and increased the responses to insulin during glucose tolerance tests, suggesting an inhibitory role of ghrelin in the control of insulin secretion (Dezaki, Κ., et al. 2004, Diabetes, 53: 3142-3151). Ablation of ghrelin in mice (ghrelin -/- mice) increases the glucose-dependent secretion of insulin by the β cells of the pancreas, by reducing the Ucp2 expression and increases the sensitivity to peripheral insulin (Sun Υ. et al., 2006, Cell Metabolism, 3: 379-386). Ghrelin receptor antagonists could thus regulate hunger, the taking of meals and their frequency, and also, in the long-term, the weight, especially weight gain following diets or therapeutic regimens. Furthermore, in the context of an antidiabetic treatment, ghrelin antagonists could be useful for maintaining the equilibrium between insulin and glucose for controlling diabetic hyperphagia. Ghrelin antagonists could thus be used as anorexic and/or anti-obesity agents, or alternatively in the treatment of diabetes and its effects.

The compounds according to the invention underwent in vivo studies. in vivo test Male Crl CD BR rats (Charles River, Italy) weighing 150-175 g were housed in a chamber at regulated temperature (22±1°C) and humidity (55±10%) and with a 12-hour lightness-darkness cycle, for at least 7 days before their use. Feed and water were available ad libitum. The feed was removed 18 hours before sacrificing the animals. The rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the stomach was removed surgically, opened along the shorter curvature and placed in a Krebs solution (of composition (η∩Μ): 118.4 NaCI; 4.7 KCI; 2.5 CaCI2; 3.7 NaH2P04; 1.2 MgS04; 25 NaHC03; 5.6 glucose). The animals were cared for and sacrificed according to the Sanofi-Aventis international code of ethics and the international principles governing the care and treatment of laboratory animals (EEC Directive 86/609, DJL358, 1, 12 December 1987). Strips of approximately 1 cm (5 mm wide) of gastric fundus were cut out along the longitudinal axis and suspended in 20 ml of bath filled with the Krebs solution at 37°C and aerated with a 95% 02-5% C02 gas mixture. The strips were maintained at a resting load of 1 g and, after washing, 10 μΜ of choline (acetylcholine precursor) and 10 μΜ of indomethacin (prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor) were added to the medium, to reduce the spontaneous phasic contractions (Depoortere et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 515, 1-3, 160-168, 2003; Dass et al., Neurosciences 120, 443-453, 2003). Isotonic contractions were initiated by stimulation with an electric field. Two platinum wire electrodes were placed at the surface and at the bottom of the organ bath, and the electric-field stimulation was performed with a Power Lab stimulator (AD Instruments Pty Ltd, Castle Hill, Australia) coupled to a multiplex pulse propeller (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy) (Fukuda et al., Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 12, 1209-1214, 2004). The supramaximal stimulation was applied to create maximum contractions (20 Hz, pulse width: 2 milliseconds; 5 volts; batch trains every 2 minutes, 150 mA). Next, the current was reduced to obtain a submaximal stimulation (50% reduction of the maximum contractile response). The contractions were recorded by computer with a data recording and analysis system (Power Lab, Chart 5) connected to isotonic transducers (Ugo Basile, Varese, Italy) via preamplifiers (Octal Bridge Amp). After stabilization, concentration-response cumulative curves for ghrelin (0.1 nM-1 μΜ) were plotted, with and without incubation (contact time: 30 minutes) of the antagonist molecules. Supramaximal electric-field stimulation was used for each strip as reference (100%) to classify the responses per test substance. The agonist concentration producing 50% of the maximum effect (EC50) was calculated using a four-parameter logistic model according to Ratkovsky and Reedy (Biometrics, 42, 575-582, 1986), with adjustment by non-linear regression using the Levenberg-Marquard algorithm in the Everstat software. The pKb values for the antagonists were calculated according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Kenakin et al., Competitive Antagonism, Pharmacologic Analysis of Drug-Receptor Interaction, 3rd edition, 331-373, Philadelphia, New York; Raven: Lippincott, 1997). The compounds of formula (I) show antagonist activity towards the ghrelin receptor with IC50 values ranging from 5χ10'8M and 1 χ10'9M. For example, the compound of Example No. 2 has an IC50 value of 1.2x10' 8M.
