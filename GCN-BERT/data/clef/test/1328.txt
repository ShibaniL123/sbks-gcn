Preparation of (1S,3R)-1-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-(2,2-difluoroethyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine
5-Bromopicolinaldehyde (2.74 g, 14.7 mmol) was added to a solution of (R)-3-(2-((2,2-difluoroethyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (1.6 g, 7.0 mmol) in acetic acid (34.4 mL) and water (0.631 mL, 35.0 mmol). The reaction was heated at 80Â° C. for 3 hours and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in MeOH (40 mL) and sodium acetate (1.15 g, 14.0 mmol) and hydroxylamine hydrochloride (0.730 g, 10.5 mmol) were added. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in water, neutralized with saturated aqueous NaHCO3, and then extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic layers were concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 90% EtOAc in hexanes. Product fractions were concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was further purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 90% EtOAc in hexanes, to afford (1S,3R)-1-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-(2,2-difluoroethyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (1.40 g, 49%) as a gum.
