Intermediate 71: 5-Chloro-2-cyclopropyl-6-(difluoromethyl)-8-ethyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
Step A: 2-Cyclopropyl-8-ethyl-6-iodo-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. To a solution of 1,2-diamino-3-ethyl-5-iodopyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (Intermediate 64, product from Step B) (400 mg, 0.86 mmol) in AcOH (10.2 mL) were added Cu(OAc)2 (78 mg, 0.43 mmol) and cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde (0.19 mL, 2.59 mmol). The mixture was heated to 70° C. for 16 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was filtered and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in EtOAc, and washed with saturated aqueous NaH4Cl solution. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (×2), and the combined organics were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC, SiO2, 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound (210 mg, 78%).
