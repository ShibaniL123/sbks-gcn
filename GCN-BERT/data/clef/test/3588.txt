No. 12/973,962 filed 21 Dec. 2010, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/284,651, filed on Dec. 22, 2009, each of is incorporated herein in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to methods of producing stabilized solid dosage forms of morphinan pharmaceutical compositions. In particular, the present invention relates to methods of preparing morphinan-protected granules that may be incorporated into solid dosage forms of morphinan pharmaceutical compositions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Minimizing the degradation of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in pharmaceutical compositions is an ongoing challenge in research and development. Degradation may occur from the physical or chemical instability of the API with incompatible pharmaceutical carriers in a pharmaceutical composition, or by reactions of the API with headspace oxygen or residual water in a composition. Oxidation is a common mechanism of API degradation in pharmaceutical compositions. The process of oxidative degradation may occur via various mechanisms such as autooxidation, nucleophilic addition, electrophilic addition, or electron transfer. Regardless of the mechanism, degradant compounds formed by the degradation of an API in a pharmaceutical composition may impart potentially harmful properties to the composition. If degradants are present in a pharmaceutical composition above the levels prescribed by ICH Guidelines Q3A and Q3B, the degradants must undergo a qualification procedure as part of the approval process required before the use and sale of the composition is allowed. Qualification of impurities typically involves costly studies using multiple animal models, and introduces considerable risk into the development process. If degradants of a pharmaceutical composition are found to be carcinogenic or teratogenic, the composition will not gain FDA approval, diminishing the opportunity for commercialization of the API. As a result, the process of selecting functional carriers for a pharmaceutical composition is particularly challenging. A functional pharmaceutical carrier is typically selected primarily to impart desired performance characteristics to the composition such as an extended release profile. In addition, it is desirable to select functional carriers that are chemically compatible with the API in the composition. In certain compositions, it may be necessary to incorporate functional carriers that may be incompatible with the API in order to achieve a desired performance of the API in the body. In this situation, identifying an effective means to prevent the degradation of the API is an essential part of the development of a successful therapeutic composition. For example, the formulation of a solid dosage form of an API may incorporate a release-modifying pharmaceutical carrier in order to achieve a desired release profile after administration of the compound. Polymer carriers such as a polyethylene oxide (PEO) polymer may be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition to impart an extended release profile to the composition. PEO polymers are produced by a process of radical polymerization process followed by oxidative degradation of the polymer to achieve the desired molecular weight. The resulting PEO polymer carriers may retain residual peroxides and other oxidative species from the production process that may cause the oxidation of the API molecules in any pharmaceutical composition that incorporates PEO polymers. Typically, other excipients such as antioxidants or pH-lowering excipients may be incorporated into the API composition to minimize the degradation of the API in the presence of incompatible carriers such as PEO polymers in the pharmaceutical composition. However, in a solid dosage form composition, this approach is less effective than in other dosage forms such as solutions or suspensions. Morphinans, a widespread class of analgesic APIs, are particularly vulnerable to oxidative degradation, especially in compositions that incorporate PEO polymer carriers or other pharmaceutical carriers that contain residual peroxides or other oxidative species. Because the physiological effects of morphinans are notoriously sensitive to small changes in chemical structure, the formation of degradants may introduce undesirable properties to a pharmaceutical composition in which a morphinan is vulnerable to degradation. For solid dosage forms of morphinan compositions, the introduction of additional antioxidant excipients or pH-lowering excipients to prevent the degradation of the morphinan, particularly when formulated in a solid dosage form, has been relatively ineffective to date. A need exists in the art for a method of protecting an API from degradation in a solid dose form of a pharmaceutical composition. In particular, a need exists for a method of stabilizing morphinan APIs, which are especially vulnerable to oxidative degradation, in solid dosage forms of pharmaceutical compositions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly, therefore, one aspect of the disclosure provides a method for the preparation of a solid dosage form pharmaceutical composition comprising a morphinan and at least one other active pharmaceutical ingredient. The method comprises three steps. In the first step, a mixture comprising the morphinan and at least one excipient is granulated in a manner such that the amount of morphinan exposed on the surface of the granule is substantially reduced thereby forming a morphinan-protected granule. The second step comprises granulating a mixture comprising the morphinan-protected granule, the active pharmaceutical agent, and at least one excipient to form a granulated mixture. In the third step, the granulated mixture is blended with a release-controlling polymer comprising a polyethylene oxide polymer to form the solid dosage form pharmaceutical composition comprising a sustained release layer. In another aspect of the disclosure, a method for the preparation of a solid dosage form pharmaceutical composition comprising oxycodone and acetaminophen is provided. The method comprises three steps. In the first step, a mixture comprising the oxycodone and at least one excipient is granulated in a manner such that the amount of oxycodone exposed on the surface of the granule is substantially reduced thereby forming an oxycodone-protected granule. In the next step, a mixture comprising the oxycodone-protected granule, the acetaminophen, and at least one excipient is granulated to form a granulated mixture. The third step comprises blending the granulated mixture with a release-controlling polymer comprising a polyethylene oxide polymer is granulated to form the solid dosage form pharmaceutical composition comprising a sustained release layer. An additional aspect of the disclosure provides a method for the preparation of a bilayer tablet comprising a sustained release layer and an immediate release layer. The method comprises four steps. In a first step, a mixture comprising oxycodone or hydrocodone and at least one excipient is granulated in a manner such that the amount of oxycodone or hydrocodone exposed on the surface of granule is substantially reduced thereby forming a morphinan-protected granule.

In the third step, the granulated mixture is blended with a release-controlling polymer comprising a polyethylene oxide polymer to form a sustained release layer. In the final step, a mixture comprising the morphinan-protected granule from the first step is granulated with the acetaminophen and at least one excipient to form the immediate release layer. A further aspect of the disclosure encompasses a granule that is substantially resistant to oxidative degradation of oxycodone. The granule comprises an interior region substantially comprising oxycodone that is surrounded by an exterior region substantially comprising at least one excipient. Moreover, the granule contains less than about 0.5% w/w of the total mass of oxycodone of a degradant selected from 10-hydroxy oxycodone, di-hydroxy oxycodone, and oxycodone n-oxide after being stored for 6 months at 40° C. and 75% relative humidity. Another aspect of the disclosure provides a granule substantially resistant to oxidative degradation of hydrocodone.

Other features and iterations of the invention are described in more detail below. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The invention provides methods of preparing morphinan-protected granules by combining a morphinan with at least one excipient to form a mixture, and granulating the mixture. The resulting morphinan-protected granules have a physical structure that minimizes the amount of morphinan that is exposed on the surface of the granule. The morphinan-protected granules may stabilize the morphinan against various mechanisms of degradation such as oxidation by substantially decreasing the amount of morphinan exposed on the surface of the granule thereby reducing the degree of contact between the morphinan and the oxidative species in the environment surrounding the granules, including but not limited to carriers and residual water in the composition, and atmospheric oxygen and moisture. In addition, if chemically protective excipients including but not limited to antioxidants and pH-adjusting agents are included in the excipient mixture forming the morphinan-protected granule, the morphinan contained within the granule is further protected against degradation. Any oxidative species contained in the environment surrounding the morphinan-protected granules may react with the chemically protective excipients situated the granules before they can reach the morphinan. The morphinan-protected granules may be prepared using any device known in the art, including but not limited to a high-shear wet granulator. The particular device used for granulation may affect the physical properties of the resulting granules, including but not limited to granule size, granule density, and granule porosity, all of which may influence the protective properties of the granule against degradation of the morphinan. Regardless of the granulation method used to form the granules, the distribution of morphinan and excipients within the granules is influenced by at least several factors including but not limited to the size of the morphinan particles relative to the excipient particles in the mixture prior to granulation, the chemical properties of the morphinan and excipients including but not limited to hydrophobicity and ionic charge, and the presence of excipients dissolved in the granulation solution used to prepare the granules. The morphinan-protected granules prepared by the methods of the invention may be incorporated into a solid dose form of a pharmaceutical composition, including but not limited to tablet and capsule formulations. In addition to protection against degradation, the inclusion of the morphinan in the form of granules imparts several other advantageous aspects to the resulting composition. Because the morphinan in the granules is protected, the choice of carrier may be selected to satisfy constraints other than compatibility with the morphinan. Carriers in the composition may instead be selected based on factors including but not limited to the cost of the carrier, the desirable modified-release properties imparted by a particular carrier. Further, variation in the characteristics of the morphinan-protected granules including granule size, excipients included in the granules, and the physical structure of the granules may be used to control the release profile or other pharmacokinetic characteristics of pharmaceutical compositions. Detailed descriptions of various embodiments of the morphinan protected granules, methods of preparing the morphinan protected granules, and solid dosage forms of pharmaceutical compositions that include the morphinan-protected granules are described in detail below. (I) Morphinan-Protected Granules The granules prepared by the methods of the invention stabilize the morphinan contained within the granules by substantially reducing the amount of morphinan exposed on the surface of the granule. In this regard, significantly less of the morphinan is in contact with any oxidative species in the environment outside of the granule, and may additionally provide chemical protection of the morphinan against degradation by surrounding the morphinan with chemically protective excipients including but not limited to antioxidants that are contained within the morphinan-protected granule. The physical structure of the morphinan-protected granule may influence the protective efficacy of the granule against degradation of the morphinan, and further influences the suitability of the granules for inclusion in various solid dose forms of pharmaceutical compositions, including but not limited to tablets and capsules. (a) Granule Structure The physical structure of the granule includes the morphinan dispersed within the excipient mixture and granulated in a manner such that the amount of morphinan exposed on the surface of the granule is substantially reduced. The particular physical structure of any embodiment of a morphinan-protected granule is influenced by at least several factors related to the method of preparing the granules and the particular morphinan and excipients included in the granule. The influence of these factors on the physical structure of the granules is described in detail below. In general, the physical structure of the granules may vary from an essentially random spatial distribution of the morphinan and excipients throughout the granules to a highly ordered distribution in which essentially all of the morphinan is contained within a sharply delineated interior region that is surrounded by an exterior region that contains essentially all of the excipients. In an embodiment, the amount of morphinan that is exposed at the surface of the granules is less than about 100% of the total weight of the morphinan in the granules. In other embodiments, the amount of morphinan that is exposed at the surface of the granules is less than about 95%, less than about 90%, less than about 80%, less than about 70%, less than about 60%, less than about 50%, less than about 40%, less than about 30%, less than about 20%, less than about 10%, and less than about 5% of the total weight of morphinan in the granule. Excipients contained within the granule may provide additional protection against degradation of the morphinan by chemically interacting with degradative compounds surrounding or within the granule. For example, the effectiveness of the excipients at protecting the morphinans in the granule may be enhanced if at least one of the excipients includes but is not limited to an antioxidant, a chelating agent, or a pH-adjusting agent. Various embodiments of the excipients included in the granule are described in detail below. The density and porosity of the exterior regions of the granules may influence the effectiveness of the exterior regions at protecting the morphinans in the granules from degradation. Exterior regions having higher densities and lower porosities may be more resistant to penetration by degradative compounds from outside the granule. The densities and porosities of the exterior regions of the granules may be influenced by at least several factors including but not limited to the particular morphinan and excipients included in the granule and the device used to prepare the granule. For example, a granule prepared using a high-shear wet granulator may have a higher density and lower porosity compared to a granule with a similar composition prepared using a fluid bed granulator. The d90 of the granules in various embodiments may be selected based on the intended use of the granules, in particular the particular solid dosage form in which the granules are to be incorporated. The particular d90 of the granule may be influenced by a variety of factors including but not limited to the composition of the granule and the granulation device used to prepare the granules. The d90 of the granules may be larger for granule compositions having a higher proportion of excipients including but not limited to binders and fillers relative to other types of excipients. In various embodiments, the granules may have an average d90 of less than about 2000 μm. In other embodiments, the granules may have an average d90 of less than about 1800 μm, less than about 1500 μm, less than about 1000 μm, less than about 900 μm, less than about 800 μm, less than about 700 μm, less than about 600 μm, less than about 500 μm, less than about 400 μm, less than about 300 μm, less than about 200 μm, less than about 150 μm, and less than about 100 μm. In one exemplary embodiment in which the granules are to be incorporated in a solid dosage form including but not limited to a capsule, the granules may be less than about 1000 μm in average d90. In another exemplary embodiment in which the granules are to be incorporated in a solid dosage form including but not limited to a tablet, the granules may be less than about 800 μm in average d90. In yet another embodiment, the granules may range from about 150 μm to about 200 μm in average d90. (II) Granule Composition The composition of the granules prepared using the methods of the invention include a morphinan and at least one excipient. The particular composition of the granules may influence a variety of properties of the granules including but not limited to the physical structure of the granules, the stability of the morphinan contained within the granule, and the suitability of the granules for incorporation into a particular dry dosage form of a pharmaceutical composition. One aspect of the composition that may influence the physical structure of the granules is the d90 of the morphinan particles relative to the d90 of the excipient particles in the mixture that used to form the granules. As used herein, d90 represents the particle diameter at which 90% of the individual particles of a compound are smaller than the specified diameter. Without being bound to any particular theory, when a granulation device including but not limited to a low-shear wet granulator, a high-shear wet granulator, or a fluid bed granulator is used to granulate the mixture of the morphinan and at least one excipient, the compounds having a smaller d90 relative to the other compounds in the mixture tend to aggregate near the interior regions of the granules, and the compounds having larger d90 tend to aggregate near the exterior regions of the granules, regardless of whether the compound is a morphinan or an excipient. As a practitioner skilled in the art may appreciate, for granule compositions in which the morphinan accounts for an extremely low proportion of the total mass of the granule, the size of the morphinan particles relative to the excipient particles may not exert the same influence on the physical structure of the resulting granules as described previously. By way of a non-limiting example, if a granule is prepared using a mixture containing about 5% morphinan and about 95% excipients by weight, and the d90 of the morphinan is larger than the d90 of the excipients, the relative scarcity of the morphinan particles may result in a granule in which the individual morphinan particles are surrounded by excipient particles, and the morphinan particles may be located in both the interior region and the exterior region of the granule. In one embodiment, the d90 of the morphinan is smaller than the d90 of the excipients. In another embodiment, the d90 of the morphinan is less than about 80% of the d90 of the excipients. In yet other embodiments, the d90 of the morphinan is less than about 75%, less than about 70%, less than about 65%, less than about 60%, less than about 55%, or less than about 50% of the d90 of the excipients. The d90 values of the morphinan and the excipients may also be influenced by the capabilities of the particular device used to prepare the granules. Without being bound to any particular theory, when a granulation device including but not limited to a low-shear wet granulator, a high-shear wet granulator, or a fluid bed granulator is used to granulate the mixture of the morphinan and at least one excipient, if the d90 of a particular compound falls below a threshold d90, the particles of that compound tend to aggregate before they are granulated, resulting in granules that have a non-homogenous distribution of the compound from granule to granule. In other embodiments, other properties of the morphinan and excipients may influence the physical structure of the granule including but not limited to the hydrophobicity and ionic charge of the morphinan relative to the one or more excipients. As a non-limiting illustrative example, if the morphinan is hydrophobic relative to the excipients and if a polar granulation fluid is used in the granulation process, hydrophobic repulsive forces may tend to situate the morphinan within the interior region of the granules. In one embodiment, the composition of the granules includes one morphinan compound. In other embodiments, the composition of the granules may further include one or more additional morphinan compounds within each granule. Any number of different morphinans may be included in the composition of the granules, so long as all morphinans that are included in the granule are physically and chemically compatible. An acid, as defined herein, refers to the acid and any pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the acid. (a) Morphinans The compositions of various embodiments of the granules include a morphinan. In one embodiment, the morphinan may be included in the granules in an amount of up to about 90% of the total weight of the granules. In other embodiments, the morphinan may be included in the granules in an amount ranging up to about 80%, up to about 70%, up to about 60%, up to about 50%, up to about 40%, up to about 30%, up to about 20%, up to about 10%, up to about 1%, and up to about 0.5% of the total weight of the granules. The morphinan included in various embodiments of the granules may be selected from opium, natural opium derivatives, semi-synthetic opium derivatives, and synthetic opium derivatives.

In an exemplary embodiment, the morphinan included in the granules may be selected from oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, nalbuphine, naloxone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone. In another exemplary embodiment, the morphinan in the granules is oxycodone or hydrocodone. Any of the morphinans included in the embodiments of the granules may have a (−) or (+) orientation with respect to the rotation of polarized light, depending upon whether the starting substrate has (−) or (+) optical activity, and are referred to herein as (−)-morphinans and (+)-morphinans respectively.

(b) Excipients Various embodiments of the granules include one or more excipients in addition to the morphinan. In general, the one or more excipients are selected to impart at least one or more desired physical or chemical properties to the granules, including but not limited to adhesion of the particles of the morphinan and excipient compounds in the mixture to facilitate the formation of granules, formation of physical barriers around the morphinans in the granules, and chemical inhibition of various mechanisms of degradation of the morphinans including but not limited to oxidation.

In another embodiment, an antioxidant agent may be subjected to a particle size reduction process including but not limited to grinding, milling, sonication, or hammer milling in order to reduce the d90 of the antioxidant agent to a value less than the d90 of the morphinan (or other API included in the formulation) prior to granulation. In this embodiment, the reduced d90 of the antioxidant agent may result in a distribution of antioxidant agent that is clustered around the morphinan particles, rather than near the outer surface of the granule. A granule having this physical structure may provide comparable protection of the morphinan in the granules against degradation as compared to granules in which the antioxidant agent is situated on the outside of the granule using a significantly lower amount of the antioxidant agent. In an exemplary embodiment, the granule composition includes at least one antioxidant including but not limited to citric acid and Na2EDTA. (iv) pH-Adjusting Agents In various embodiments of the granule composition, a pH-adjusting agent may be included as an excipient to raise or lower the pH of the granule in order to prevent the oxidation of the morphinan in the granules. For example, a pH-adjusting agent including but not limited to citric acid may be incorporated into the composition granule in order to lower the pH of the granule. In this example, a lower pH prevents the oxidation of the granule by various oxidative compounds associated with release-modifying polymer incorporated into a sold dosage form, including but not limited to peroxides. In another embodiment, a pH-adjusting agent may be subjected to a particle size reduction process including but not limited to grinding, milling, sonication, or hammer milling in order to reduce the d90 of the pH-adjusting agent to a value less than the d90 of the morphinan prior to granulation. In this embodiment, the reduced d90 of the pH-adjusting agent may result in a distribution of pH-adjusting agent that is clustered around the morphinan particles, rather than near the outer surface of the granule. Non-limiting examples of pH-adjusting agents include citric acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, phosphoric acid, sorbic acid, benzoic acid, sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate.

(III) Granule Stability In various embodiments of the granule composition, the morphinan in the granule is substantially resistant to degradation due to interactions of the morphinan with degradative compounds or conditions present in the environment or in the carriers surrounding the granules in a solid dosage form of a pharmaceutical composition. In one embodiment, the morphinan in the granules is substantially resistant to the formation of degradants resulting from a chemical change in the morphinan brought about during the production and/or storage of the pharmaceutical composition containing the morphinan by the effect of factors including but not limited to light, temperature, pH, water, or reaction with an excipient or carrier included in the pharmaceutical composition. The particular degradants formed in a pharmaceutical composition depend on the particular morphinan and the at least one excipient within the granule, as well as the particular carriers included in the pharmaceutical composition along with the granules. Statutory requirements, including but not limited to ICH Guidelines Q3A and Q3B identify maximum allowable amounts of degradants above which the degradants must be reported and subjected to the qualification process described above. According to ICH Guideline Q3B, the amount of any individual degradant must be reported if the amount of degradant exceeds 0.10% of the total API weight for maximum daily doses of 1000 mg of API or below. For APIs having average daily doses of above 1000 mg, degradants in excess of 0.05% of the total API mass must be reported. The ICH guidelines apply throughout the effective shelf life of the pharmaceutical composition. Although no standardized method of assessing API stability exists at present, drug developers typically subject potential pharmaceutical compounds to periods of storage at accelerated degradation conditions, typically defined as a temperature of about 40° C. and a relative humidity of about 75%. The period of storage time at the accelerated degradation conditions may vary from about 1 day to about 6 months, but is typically about 6 months. In an embodiment, the formation of any one degradant in the composition may be limited to less than about 0.5%, less than about 0.4%, less than about 0.3%, less than about 0.2%, less than about 0.1%, less than 0.05%, less than 0.04%, less than 0.03%, less than 0.02%, or less than 0.01% of the total mass of the morphinan after about two months of storage at a temperature of about 40° C. and a relative humidity of about 75%. In another embodiment, the formation of any one degradant in the composition may be limited to less than about 0.5%, less than about 0.4%, less than about 0.3%, less than about 0.2%, less than about 0.1%, less than 0.05%, less than 0.04%, less than 0.03%, less than 0.02%, or less than 0.01% of the total mass of the morphinan after about six months of storage at a temperature of about 40° C. and a relative humidity of about 75%. In yet another embodiment, the formation of any one degradant in the composition may be limited to less than about 0.5%, less than about 04%, less than about 0.3%, less than about 0.2%, less than about 0.1%, less than 0.05%, less than 0.04%, less than 0.03%, less than 0.02%, or less than 0.01% of the total mass of the morphinan after about four weeks of storage at accelerated stability conditions at a temperature of about 40° C. and a relative humidity of about 75%. In an exemplary embodiment, for a pharmaceutical composition incorporating oxycodone as the morphinan and at least one excipient in the form of granules, the granules contain less than about 0.5% w/w of the total mass of oxycodone of a degradant selected from 10-hydroxy oxycodone, di-hydroxy oxycodone, and oxycodone n-oxide after being stored for 6 months at 40° C. and 75% relative humidity. In another exemplary embodiment, for a pharmaceutical composition incorporating oxycodone and at least one excipient in the form of granules, the granules contain less than about 0.5% w/w of the total mass of oxycodone of each of one or more degradants selected from 10-hydroxy oxycodone, di-hydroxy oxycodone, and oxycodone n-oxide after being stored for 6 months at 40° C. and 75% relative humidity. In another exemplary embodiment, for a pharmaceutical composition incorporating hydrocodone as the morphinan and at least one excipient in the form of granules, the granules contain less than about 0.5% w/w of the total mass of hydrocodone of a degradant selected from hydrocodone n-oxide and hydrocodone aldol dimer after being stored for 6 months at 40° C. and 75% relative humidity. In another exemplary embodiment, for a pharmaceutical composition incorporating hydrocodone and at least one excipient in the form of granules, the granules contain less than about 0.5% w/w of the total mass of hydrocodone of each of one or more degradants selected from hydrocodone n-oxide and hydrocodone aldol dimer after being stored for 6 months at 40° C. and 75% relative humidity (IV) Method of Preparing Granules In various embodiments, the granules may be prepared by combining the morphinan with at least one excipient to form a mixture and granulating the mixture in a manner such that the amount of morphinan exposed on the surface of the granules is minimized (thereby forming a morphinan-protected granule). Suitable morphinans for the granule embodiments are described in detail in Section (IIa) above, and suitable excipients are described in Section (IIb) above.

Further, the high-shear wet granulator is capable of preparing granules with a d90 that is larger than other granulation devices, resulting in granules suitable for inclusion in a wider variety of solid dosage forms of morphinan compositions. In the same exemplary embodiment, the morphinan and the excipients in dry form of the composition are introduced into the wet high shear granulator in order to form the mixture. After the morphinan and the dry excipients are essentially homogeneously distributed within the granulator, a granulation fluid is sprayed into the granulator. In various embodiments, the granulation fluid may be any volatile, non-toxic granulation fluid known in the art. Non-limiting examples of suitable granulation fluids include water, ethanol, isopropanol, and combinations thereof. In other embodiments, one or more of the excipients may be mixed with the granulation fluid prior to spraying the granulation fluid into the granulator.

Example 1 Incorporation of Protected Oxycodone Granules into Bilayer Tablet Composition To demonstrate the feasibility of forming protected morphinan granules and incorporating the protected morphinan granules into a solid dosage form, the following experiment was conducted. Powdered oxycodone HCl, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), and citric acid powder (an antioxidant) were mixed together and charged into a high-shear granulator. An aqueous solution containing pregelatinized starch (PGS) and Na2EDTA (an antioxidant) was sprayed into the high-speed granulator, resulting in the formation of wet granules. The wet granules were then dried until less than about 2% water remained in the granules. The dried granules had particle sizes ranging from about 100-300 μm. The composition of the protected oxycodone granules is summarized in Table 3: TABLE 3 Composition of Protected Oxycodone Granules Dry Weight Compound (% tot. wt.) Oxycodone HCl 30.0% MCC 63.6% PGS 4.0% Na2EDTA 0.4% Citric acid 2.0% The oxycodone-protected granules were divided into two groups to be incorporated into batches of immediate release (IR) granules and into batches of sustained release (SR) granules used to form the IR and SR Layers of a bilayer tablet, respectively. Both the IR granules and the SR granules were formed using separate fluid bed granulation processes. In each process, the previously-formed protected oxycodone granules, powdered acetaminophen (APAP), and various excipients including disintegrants, binders; and fillers were charged into the fluid bed granulation device and sprayed with a granulation fluid, resulting in the formation of IR granules in one batch and SR granules in a second batch. The composition of the resulting IR and SR granules are summarized in Table 4: TABLE 4 Composition of IR and SR Granules Dry Wt (% total wt.) Compound IR Layer SR Layer Protected oxycodone granules 16.1% 14.2% APAP 67.8% 81.2% MCC 5.0% Hydroxypropyl cellulose 8.1% 4.5% Cross carmellose sodium 3.0% The IR granules were blended with lubricant excipients in preparation for the tablet pressing process. Similarly, the SR particles were blended with various excipients including lubricants, and polyethylene oxide polymer, and a filler in preparation for the tablet pressing process. The compositions of the IR blend and the SR blend are summarized in Table 5: TABLE 5 Composition of IR and SR Blends Dry Wt. (% total wt.) Compound IR Blend SR Blend IR granules 99.25% SR granules 52.30% Silicon dioxide 0.50% 0.50% Magnesium stearate 0.25% 0.10% MCC 1.20% Polyethylene oxide polymer 45.00% The IR blend and the SR blend were loaded into a bilayer tablet press and formed into bilayer tablets having about 29% of the IR blend and about 71% the SR blend by weight. The results of this experiment demonstrated that protected morphinan granules could be formed using a process of high shear wet granulation and incorporated into a solid oral therapeutic composition. Example 2 Oxidative Stability Assessment of Bilayer Tablet Composition To assess the effect of incorporating a morphinan in the form of protected granules into a solid dosage therapeutic composition on the oxidative stability of the composition, the following experiment was conducted. Unprotected bilayer tablets were formed using a process similar to that described in Example 1, except that powdered oxycodone HCl, rather than protected oxycodone granules, were incorporated into the IR and SR granules formed using the fluid bed granulation device. Protected bilayer tablets formed using protected oxycodone granules as described in Example 1 were also obtained. The unprotected bilayer tablets were similar in composition to the protected bilayer tablets, except that the unprotected bilayer tablets lacked antioxidant excipients and oxycodone-protected granules, although the overall oxycodone contents of the two formulations of bilayer tablet were comparable. A batch of protected bilayer tablets and a batch of unprotected tablets were placed into an environmental chamber and exposed to accelerated stability conditions. In particular, all bilayer tablets were kept in the environmental chamber at a temperature of 55° C. and a relative humidity of 80% for a period of six days. For the remainder of the first month and for the duration of a second month, the bilayer tablets were exposed to a temperature of 4° C. and a relative humidity of 75%. After six days, one month, and two months in the environmental chamber, samples of the protected and unprotected formulations were removed from the chamber and submitted to mass spectrographic analysis to determine the presence of three oxidative degradants of oxycodone: dihydroxy oxycodone, oxycodone n-oxide, and 10-hydroxy oxycodone. The results of these analyses are summarized in Table 6 below: TABLE 6 Oxidative Stability of Unprotected vs. Protected Formulations of Bilayer Tablets Amount of Degradant Formed (% weight of oxycodone) Degradation Di-hydroxy 10-hydroxy Oxycodone n- Conditions oxycodone oxycodone oxide Time Temp. Relative Not Not Not (days) (° C.) Humidity (%) Protected Protected Protected Protected Protected Protected 6 55 80 0.20 0.00 0.04 0.00 0.12 0.03 30 40 75 0.05 0.01 0.01 0.00 0.12 0.01 60 40 75 0.11 0.02 0.03 0.00 0.21 0.03 The protected formulation of the bilayer tablets that incorporated the oxycodone-protected granules had significantly lower levels of all degradants after exposure to all environmental conditions. No 10-hydroxy oxycodone was measured at any environmental condition for the protected formulation of the bilayer tablet. The results of this experiment demonstrated that the formation of oxidative degradants of oxycodone was significantly inhibited by the incorporation of the oxycodone in the form of protected granules. In particular, the bilayer tablets formed using the protected oxycodone granules were significantly more stable than similar bilayer tablets formed using unprotected oxycodone powder. Example 3 Effect of Granule Composition on Oxidative Stability To assess the effect of various granule compositions on the oxidative stability of the morphinan encapsulated in the granules, the following experiment was conducted. Granules containing oxycodone and various combinations of excipients were formed using methods similar to those described in Example 1. The specific compositions of the granules are summarized in Table 7: TABLE 7 Composition of IR and SR Granules Granule Composition (% w/w) Compound 1 2 3 5 6 Oxycodone 30 30 30 30 30 MCC 65 64.95 62.2 64.95 62.2 HPC 5 4.6 4.6 BHA 0.05 0.05 EDTA 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 Ascorbic 2.8 2.8 Acid PGS 4.6 4.6 For granule compositions 1, 2, and 3 the HPC and EDTA were dissolved in a granulation solution and applied to a dry mixture of the remaining ingredients. For granule compositions 5 and 6, the PGS and EDTA were dissolved in a granulations solution and applied to a dry mixture of the remaining ingredients. The resulting granules were stored at accelerated stability conditions for a period of 4 weeks at 40° C. and 75% relative humidity. Samples of the granules were taken just before storage and after one, two, and four weeks of storage at accelerated stability conditions and subjected to mass spectrographic analysis as described in Example 2 to determine the presence of oxidative degradants of oxycodone. The results of the analyses of the samples taken after four weeks of storage are summarized in Table 8 below: TABLE 8 Oxidative Stability of Granule Formulations Impurity After 4 Weeks at Accelerated Degradation Conditions (% wt of oxycodone) Composition 6-a-Oxycodol Noroxy 1 0.11 0.01 2 0.11 0.02 3 0.33 0.13 5 0.11 0.00 6 0.29 0.14 The impurities for granule compositions 1, 2, and 5 were all of comparable low amounts, indicating that the granulation of the oxycodone resulted in a protective effect from oxidative degradation. This protective effect was achieved even in granule composition 1, which did not include any antioxidant excipients. However, granule compositions 3 and 6, which contained ascorbic acid, resulted in much higher levels of oxidative impurities after 4 weeks of storage at accelerated stability conditions, indicating that the ascorbic acid may produce oxidative products that result in the long-term degradation of the oxycodone. The results of this experiment demonstrated the protective effect of granulation against the oxidative degradation of oxycodone, so long as ascorbic acid was not included in the granule composition. Example 4 Effect of Granulation Composition on Oxidative Stability of Solid Dose Oxycodone/APAP Formulations To assess the effect of encapsulation on the oxidative stability of the morphinan in various solid dose formulations, the following experiment was conducted. Solid dose tablets were formed using the methods described in Example 2. The solid dose tablets contained the oxycodone either in the protected granular form described in Example 3, or as the same ingredients in a powdered form rather than as granules. In both cases, the oxycodone and excipients were combined with APAP and polyethylene oxide (PEO) polymer. Each tablet contained 10% of the oxycodone granule compositions described in Example 3, in either granulated or powdered form, 46.8% APAP, and 43.2% PEO polymer on a weight basis. The protected and unprotected tablet formulations were stored at accelerated stability conditions for a period of 4 weeks at 40° C. and 75% relative humidity. Samples of the tablets were taken just before storage and after one, two, and four weeks of storage at accelerated stability conditions and subjected to mass spectrographic analysis as described in Example 2 to determine the presence of oxidative degradants of oxycodone. The results of these analysis of the samples taken after four weeks of storage are summarized in Table 9 below: TABLE 9 Effect of Granulation on Oxidative Stability of Tablet Formulations Impurity After 4 Weeks at Accelerated Composition Degradation Conditions (% wt of oxycodone) Combined 6-a-Oxycodol Noroxy with APAP and Protected Protected PEO Polymer granules Unprotected Granules Unprotected 1 0.20 .74 0.03 .27 2 0.22 .51 0.05 .28 3 0.60 1.25* 0.11 .14* 5 0.17 .49 0.01 .18 *measured at two weeks after storage All of the protected tablet formulations, in which the oxycodone was granulated using methods similar to those described in Example 1 formed significantly lower levels of impurities after storage for 4 weeks at accelerated stability conditions compared to tablets containing non-granulated oxycodone and the same excipients The results of this experiment demonstrated that granulating the oxycodone and excipients prior to incorporating the granules in a tableting process resulted in tablets with superior stability compared to tablets formed using the same oxycodone and excipients in a loose powder form, independent of the particular composition of excipients in the formulation. Example 5 Incorporation of Protected Oxycodone Granules into Bilayer Tablet Composition To demonstrate the feasibility of forming protected morphinan granules and incorporating the protected morphinan granules into a solid dosage form, the following experiment was conducted to prepare a 7.5 mg oxycodone/325 mg acetaminophen tablet. Powdered oxycodone HCl, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), pregelatinized starch (PGS), Na2EDTA (an antioxidant), and citric acid powder (an antioxidant) were charged into a high-shear granulator and mixed together. An aqueous solution containing pregelatinized starch (PGS) was sprayed into the high-speed granulator, resulting in the formation of wet granules. The wet granules were then dried until less than about 5% water remained in the granules. The dried granules had particle sizes ranging from about 100-300 μm after milling. The composition of the oxycodone-protected granules is summarized in Table 10: TABLE 10 Composition of Protected Oxycodone Granules Dry Weight Compound (% tot. wt.) Oxycodone HCl 30.0% MCC 63.6% PGS 4.0% Na2EDTA 0.4% Citric acid 2.0% The oxycodone-protected granules were divided into two groups to be incorporated into batches of immediate release (IR) granules and into batches of sustained release (SR) granules used to form the IR and SR Layers of a bilayer tablet, respectively. Both the IR granules and the SR granules were formed using separate fluid bed granulation processes. In each process, the previously-formed oxycodone-protected granules, powdered acetaminophen (APAP), and various excipients including disintegrants, binders, and fillers were charged into the fluid bed granulation device and sprayed with a granulation fluid, resulting in the formation of IR granules in one batch and SR granules in a second batch. The composition of the resulting IR and SR granules are summarized in Table 11: TABLE 11 Composition of IR and SR Granules Dry Wt. (% total wt.)

Similarly, the SR particles were blended with various excipients including lubricants, and polyethylene oxide polymer, and a filler in preparation for the tablet pressing process. The compositions of the IR blend and the SR blend are summarized in Table 12: TABLE 12 Composition of IR and SR Blends Dry Wt. (% total wt.)

The results of this experiment demonstrated that protected morphinan granules could be formed using a process of high shear wet granulation and incorporated into a solid oral therapeutic composition. Example 6 Incorporation of Protected Hydrocodone Granules into Bilayer Tablet Composition To demonstrate the feasibility of forming protected morphinan granules and incorporating the protected morphinan granules into a solid dosage form, the following experiment was conducted to prepare a 7.5 mg hydrocodone/325 mg acetaminophen tablet. Powdered hydrocodone bitartrate, microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), pregelatinized starch (PGS) and citric acid powder (an antioxidant) were mixed together and charged into a high-shear granulator. An aqueous solution containing pregelatinized starch (PGS) and Na2EDTA (an antioxidant) was sprayed into the high-speed granulator, resulting in the formation of wet granules. The wet granules were then dried until less than about 5% water remained in the granules. The dried granules had particle sizes ranging from about 100-300 μm after milling.
