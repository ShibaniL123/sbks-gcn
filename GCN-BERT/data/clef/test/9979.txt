Macrocyclic Pyridazinone derivatives The present invention provides Macrocyclic Pyridazinone derivatives of Formula (I) as IRAK inhibitors and their use in the treatment of cancer, and other diseases related to IRAK overexpression, like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus or lupus nephritis. Background: Kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of proteins, lipids, sugars, nucleosides and other cellular metabolites and play key roles in all aspects of eukaryotic cell physiology. Especially, protein kinases and lipid kinases participate in the signaling events which control the activation, growth, differentiation and survival of cells in response to extracellular mediators or stimuli such as growth factors, cytokines or chemokines. In general, protein kinases are classified in two groups, those that preferentially phosphorylate tyrosine residues and those that preferentially phosphorylate serine and/or threonine residues. Kinases are important therapeutic targets for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs (Cohen, 2009. Current Opinion in Cell Biology 21, 1-8), for example kinases that are involved in the orchestration of adaptive and innate immune responses. Kinase targets of particular interest are members of the IRAK family. The interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are critically involved in the regulation of intracellular signaling networks controlling inflammation (Ringwood and Li, 2008. Cytokine 42, 1-7). IRAKs are expressed in many cell types and can mediate signals from various cell receptors including toll-like receptors (TLRs). IRAK4 is thought to be the initial protein kinase activated downstream of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor and all toll-like-receptors (TLRs) except TLR3, and initiates signaling in the innate immune system via the rapid activation of IRAKI and slower activation of IRAK2. IRAKI was first identified through biochemical purification of the IL-1 dependent kinase activity that co-immunoprecipitates with the IL-1 type 1 receptor (Cao et al., 1996. Science 271(5252): 1128-31). IRAK2 was identified by the search of the human expressed sequence tag (EST) database for sequences homologous to IRAKI (Muzio et al., 1997. Science 278(5343): 1612-5). IRAK3 (also called IRAKM) was identified using a murine EST sequence encoding a polypeptide with significant homology to IRAKI to screen a human phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) cDNA library (Wesche et al., 1999. J. Biol. Chem. 274(27): 19403-10). IRAK4 was identified by database searching for IRAK-like sequences and PCR of a universal cDNA library (Li et al., 2002. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99(8):5567-5572). Mice that express a catalytically inactive mutant of IRAK4 instead of the wild-type kinase are completely resistant to septic shock triggered by several TLR agonists and are impaired in their response to IL-1. Children who lack IRAK4 activity due to a genetic defect suffer from recurring infection by pyogenic bacteria. It appears that IRAKdependent TLRs and IL-1Rs are vital for childhood immunity against some pyogenic bacteria but play a redundant role in protective immunity to most infections in adults. Therefore IRAK4 inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases in adults without making them too susceptible to bacterial and viral infections (Cohen, 2009. Current Opinion in Cell Biology 21, 1-8). Potent IRAK4 inhibitors have been developed (Buckley et al., 2008. Bioorg Med Chem Lett. 18(12):3656-60). IRAKI is essential for the TLR7 -mediated and TLR9-mediated activation of IRF7 and the production of interferon- alpha (IFN-a) suggesting that IRAKI inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). IRAK2 is activated downstream of IRAK4 and plays a role in proinflammatory cytokine production. Therefore IRAK2 inhibitors may be useful for inflammatory diseases.

Above and below, all radicals and indices have the meaning indicated under the generic structural formula, unless expressly stated otherwise. Generally, compounds of formula I are the more preferred, the more preferred substituents they carry. Throughout the invention, all radicals which occur more than once may be identical or different, i.e. are independent of one another. The compounds of the formula I may have one or more chiral centres and can therefore occur in various stereoisomeric forms. The formula I encompasses all these forms. Accordingly, the invention relates, in particular, to the compounds of the formula I in which at least one of the said radicals has one of the preferred meanings indicated above. Preferred compounds No. 1 to 42 of formula (I) are given below together with their activities (IC5o values were obtained according to the IRAK 1 and IRAK 4 enzymatic assays described in Example 42): Compound No. Structure IC50 IRAKI IC50IRAK4 *** ο nd ο ο 0 14 ο 32a 32b *** 33 ο *** 38 V / ο % // 0 nd nd nd nd nd Pharmaceutical salts and other forms The said compounds according to the invention can be used in their final non-salt form. On the other hand, the present invention also encompasses the use of these compounds in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which can be derived from various organic and inorganic acids and bases by procedures known in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of the compounds of the formula I are for the most part prepared by conventional methods.

Particular preference is given to hydrochloride, dihydrochloride, hydrobromide, maleate, mesylate, phosphate, sulfate and succinate. The acid-addition salts of basic compounds of the formula I are prepared by bringing the free base form into contact with a sufficient amount of the desired acid, causing the formation of the salt in a conventional manner. The free base can be regenerated by bringing the salt form into contact with a base and isolating the free base in a conventional manner. The free base forms differ in a certain respect from the corresponding salt forms thereof with respect to certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents; for the purposes of the invention, however, the salts otherwise correspond to the respective free base forms thereof. As mentioned, the pharmaceutically acceptable base-addition salts of the compounds of the formula I are formed with metals or amines, such as alkali metals and alkaline earth metals or organic amines. Preferred metals are sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium. Preferred organic amines are N,N’-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-methyl-D-glucamine and procaine. The base-addition salts of acidic compounds according to the invention are prepared by bringing the free acid form into contact with a sufficient amount of the desired base, causing the formation of the salt in a conventional manner. The free acid can be regenerated by bringing the salt form into contact with an acid and isolating the free acid in a conventional manner. The free acid forms differ in a certain respect from the corresponding salt forms thereof with respect to certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents; for the purposes of the invention, however, the salts otherwise correspond to the respective free acid forms thereof. If a compound according to the invention contains more than one group which is capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts of this type, the invention also encompasses multiple salts. Typical multiple salt forms include, for example, bitartrate, diacetate, difumarate, dimeglumine, diphosphate, disodium and trihydrochloride, but this is not intended to represent a restriction. With regard to that stated above, it can be seen that the expression "pharmaceutically acceptable salt” in the present connection is taken to mean an active ingredient which comprises a compound of the formula I in the form of one of its salts, in particular if this salt form imparts improved pharmacokinetic properties on the active ingredient compared with the free form of the active ingredient or any other salt form of the active ingredient used earlier. The pharmaceutically acceptable salt form of the active ingredient can also provide this active ingredient for the first time with a desired pharmacokinetic property which it did not have earlier and can even have a positive influence on the pharmacodynamics of this active ingredient with respect to its therapeutic efficacy in the body.

For all the protection and deprotection methods, see Philip J. Kocienski, in “Protecting Groups”, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York, 1994 and, Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. Μ. Wuts in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”, Wiley Interscience, 3rd Edition 1999. Depending on the nature of the substituents (R1, Ζ and L etc.) different synthetic strategies may be selected for the synthesis of compounds of the invention. In the process illustrated in the following schemes the substituents (R1, Ζ and L etc.) are as above defined in the description unless otherwise mentioned. Compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by intramolecular coupling of a carboxylic acid compound of general formula (II) wherein Α1 is Η, Li, Na or Κ as outlined in scheme 1. General protocols for such reaction are given below in the examples, using conditions and methods well known to those skilled in the art. Standard coupling agent, such as HBTU, EDC, Τ3Ρ or isobutyl chloroformate can be used in the presence or not of an additive such as HOBt and a base such as DIEA, TEA or ΝΜΜ in a suitable solvent such as DMF, Acetonitrile, THF or DCM at a temperature rising from about 0°C to 50°C. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid derivative (such as acyl chloride) can be reacted using conditions and methods well known to those skilled in the art, in the presence of a base such as pyridine or DIEA in a suitable solvent such as toluene, DCM, THF or DMF, at a temperature rising from about 0°C to RT, preferably at RT, for a few hours. In this cyclisation step, typical concentration of compound of general formula (II) ranges from 0.01 to 1Μ. Scheme 1 Compounds of formula (II) wherein Α1 is Η or Li, Na or Κ can be prepared in two steps by alkylation of an amino benzimidazole compound of general formula (IV) with a compound of general formula (V) wherein R is an alkyl group and LG1 is a leaving group such as bromine, chlorine, iodine, an alkylsulfonate or any other suitable leaving group known to those skilled in the art followed by a hydrolysis of intermediate ester of general formula (III) wherein R is an alkyl group as outlined in scheme 2a. Alternatively intermediates of general formula (III) can be obtained by alkylation of an amino benzimidazole compound of general formula (IV) with an epoxide of general formula (V) wherein R is an alkyl group and L’ is (CH2)n-i as outlined in scheme 2b. General protocols for such reaction are given below in the examples, using conditions and methods well known to those skilled in the art. In a typical procedure, a compound of Formula (V) wherein LG1 is as defined above is treated with a base, such as but not limited to NaH, K2C03, Cs2C03, ΚΟΗ, LDA, LiHMDS, preferably NaH, and with an aminobenzimidazole of general formula (IV) in a suitable solvent such as THF, dioxane, DMF, DMA, at a temperature between -20 °C to about 150 °C, for a time between a few minutes to a few hours. Hydrolysis of the ester (III) wherein R is as above defined can be performed, for example, using HCI, H2S04, or using LiOH, NaOH or ΚΟΗ in water, water/THF, water/THF/ethanol or water/dioxane, at temperatures between 0 and 100°C. Acid or salt form is obtained depending on the reaction treatment selected (basic or acidic conditions). Scheme 2b R2 O R4 O h2n L 0 Ν (V) (IV) (III) Aminobenzimidazoles of general formula (IV) can be obtained from commercial sources or can be synthesized following procedures well known to those skilled in the art such as but not limited to those described in J. Org. Chem. 1977, 42, 542 or Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 2006, 16, 2842-2845. Compounds of formula (V) wherein LG1 is a leaving group such as bromine, chlorine, iodine, an alkylsulfonate or any other suitable leaving group known to those skilled in the art can be prepared from an alcohol of general formula (VI) wherein R is as above defined using conditions and methods well known to those skilled in the art as outlined in scheme 3. In a typical procedure, to obtain a compound of general formula (V) wherein R is as above defined and LG1 is an halogen, a compound of Formula (VI) wherein R is as above defined, can be treated with an halogenation agent such as SOCb, POCI3, PCI5, PBr3 in a solvent such as DCM at a temperature rising from 0°C to 60°C, preferably at RT for a few hours. To obtain a compound of general Formula (V) wherein LG1 is an alkylsulfonate, typical sulfonylation conditions use appropriate sulfonyl chloride in presence of a base such as TEA, DIEA or pyridine, optionally, a catalytic amount of 4-DMAP in a solvent such as DCM or THF at a temperature rising from 0°C to 50°C, preferably at RT. Compounds of formula (VI) wherein R is as above defined can be prepared by Suzuki-Miyura coupling reaction between a pyridazinone of general formula (VIII) wherein LG2 is halogen or a trifluoromethanesulfonate group and R is as above defined and a boronic acid or ester of Formula (VII) wherein R is as above defined as outlined in Scheme 4. General protocols for the Suzuki-Miyura coupling reaction are given below in the Examples, using conditions and methods well known to those skilled in the art to perform such coupling (see for example Miyaura, Ν.; Suzuki, A. Chem. Rev. 1995, 95, 2457; Takahiro I. and Toshiaki Μ., Tetrahedron Lett. 2005, 46, 3573-3577). In a typical procedure, an pyridazinone of general formula (VIII) and a boronic acid or ester of Formula (VII) are heated in a suitable solvent, such as THF, toluene, DMF or dioxane, in the presence or absence of water as a co-solvent, in the presence of a base, such as Cs2C03, Na20O3, K2CC>3, CsF, and with an appropriate catalyst such as but not limited to dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(ll), Pd(PPh3)4 or 1,Τbis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocenedichloro palladium(ll), Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, Pd(CI)2(PPh3)2 or Pd/C in the presence or absence of an additional ligand, such as but not limited to P(tBu)3, Ρ(0Τ0ΐ)3, PPh3, BINAP. This coupling reaction can be carried out at a temperature between about 20°C to about 150°C, preferably at about 120°C, for a few minutes to a few hours, possibly under microwave irradiation. (VIII) (VII) (VI) Boronic acid and esters of general formula (VII) wherein R is as above defined can be obtained from commercial sources or can be synthesized following procedures well known to those skilled in the art such as but not limited to those described in Boronic Acids, Edited by Dennis G. Hall 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim or J. Chem. Soc., 60, 1995, 7508-7510. Alternatively, Compounds of formula (VI) wherein R is as above defined can be prepared by Suzuki-Miyura coupling reaction between a pyridazinone boronic ester of general formula (X) wherein R is as above defined and a compound of general formula (IX) wherein LG2 is an halogen or a trifluoromethanesulfonate group as outlined in scheme 5. Typical procedures for those transformations are the same as described above. Scheme 5 (IX) Boronic esters of general formula (X) wherein R is as above defined can be prepared from a pyridazinone of general formula (VIII) wherein LG2 is halogen or a trifluoromethanesulfonate group and R is as above defined by reaction with an appropriate diboron derivative, such as but not limited to bis(pinacolato)diboron, bis(catecholate)diboron, bis(diethyl-D-tartrate glycolato)diboron, bis(hexyleneglycolato)diboron, bis(neopentylglycolato)diboron, preferably bis(pinacolato)diboron, in the presence of a suitable catalyst, such as but not limited to 1,1’bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocenedichloro palladium(ll), dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(ll), Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(OAc)2, Pd2(dba)3, Pd(CI)2(PPh3)2, preferably 1,1’bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocenedichloro palladium(ll), in the presence of a suitable base such as but not limited to potassium acetate, cesium fluoride, potassium carbonate, preferably potassium acetate, in the presence of a solvent such as but not limited to THF, dioxane, DCE, DMF, preferably THF or dioxane, at a temperature between about 20 °C to about 150 °C, preferably at about 120 °C, for a few minutes to a few hours, possibly under microwave irradiation. Compounds of formula (VIII) wherein LG2 is halogen or a trifluoromethanesulfonate group and R is as above defined can be prepared by alkylation of a pyridazinone of general formula (XI) wherein LG2 is as above defined with a compound of general formula (XII) wherein R is as above define and LG1 is a leaving group such as bromine, chlorine, iodine, an alkylsulfonate or any other suitable leaving group known to those skilled in the art or an OH group as outline in scheme 6. General protocols for such transformation are given below in the Examples, using conditions and methods well known to those skilled in the art. In a typical procedure, a pyridazinone of general formula (XI) wherein LG2 is as above defined is treated with a base, such as but not limited to NaH, K2CO3, Cs2C03, LDA, LiHMDS, preferably NaH, and with compound of general formula (XII) wherein R is as above define and LG1 is a leaving group such as bromine, chlorine, iodine, an alkylsulfonate or any other suitable leaving group known to those skilled in the art, in a suitable solvent like THF, dioxane, DMF, DMA, at a temperature between -20 °C to about 150 °C, for a time between a few minutes to a few hours. Alternatively, Compounds of formula (VIII) wherein R and LG2 are as above defined can be obtained by reaction of a compound of Formula (XII) wherein L1 is an OH group with a pyridazinone of Formula (XI) wherein LG2 is as above defined using conditions well known to those skilled in the art for a Mitsunobu reaction (see for example Hughes, D. L. Organic Reactions (New York), 1992, 42, 335-656; Reynolds, A. J.; Kassiou, Μ. Current Organic Chemistry, 2009, 13 (16)\ 1610-1632). Typically, the reaction takes place in the presence of a phosphine, such as but not limited to P(fBu)3, PPBU3, Ρ(0Τ0ΐ)3, PPh3, in the presence of an azadicarboxylate, such as but not limited to diethylazadicarboxylate, diisopropylazadicarboxylate, Tetramethylazodicarboxamide, in a solvent such as THF, dioxane, DCM, DCE, at a temperature between -20 °C to about 150 °C, preferably at room temperature, for a time between a few minutes to a few hours. Compounds of this invention can be isolated in association with solvent molecules by crystallization from an appropriate solvent or by evaporation of an appropriate solvent. The pharmaceutically acceptable anionic salts of the compounds of Formula (I), which contain a basic center, may be prepared in a conventional manner. For example, a solution of the free base may be treated with a suitable acid, either neat or in a suitable solution, and the resulting salt isolated either by filtration or by evaporation under vacuum of the reaction solvent. The pharmaceutically acceptable cationic salts of the compounds of Formula (I), which contain an acidic center, may be prepared in a conventional manner. For example, a solution of the free acid may be treated with a suitable base, either neat or in a suitable solution, and the resulting salt isolated either by filtration or by evaporation under vacuum of the reaction solvent. In some cases, salts can be prepared by mixing a solution of the acid with a solution of an alkali or earth alkali salt (such as sodium ethylhexanoate, magnesium oleate), employing a solvent in which the desired alkali or earth alkali salt of the compounds of formula (I) precipitates, or can be otherwise isolated by concentration and addition of a non-solvent. Both types of salts may be formed or interconverted using ion-exchange resin techniques. Depending on the conditions used, the reaction times are generally between a few minutes and 14 days. The reaction temperature is between about -30°C and about 140°C, normally between -10°C and 90°C, in particular between about 0°C and 70°C. The formula (I) and related formulae also encompasses the optically active forms (stereoisomers), the enantiomers, the racemates, the diastereomers and the hydrates and solvates of these compounds. The term “solvates of the compounds” is taken to mean adductions of inert solvent molecules onto the compounds which form owing to their mutual attractive force. Solvates are, for example, mono- or dihydrates or alcoholates. The synthetic strategies and methods described above can be used to obtain all compounds according to the present invention. In particular all synthetic strategies and methods described can be used for the synthesis of following compounds: The term “pharmaceutically usable derivatives” is taken to mean, for example, the salts of the compounds of the formula I and so-called pro_,drug compounds. The term “prodrug derivatives” is taken to mean compounds of the formula I which have been modified with, for example, alkyl or acyl groups, sugars or oligopeptides and which are rapidly cleaved in the organism to form the active compounds. Preferably "prodrug", as of the compounds of formula I, refers to derivative compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the formula I, as for example by hydrolysis in blood. Τ. Higuchi and V. Stella provide a thorough discussion of the prodrug concept in "Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems", Vol 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, American Chemical Society (1975). Examples of esters useful as prodrugs for compounds containing carboxyl groups can be found on pages 14-21 of "Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design: Theory and Application", edited by Ε. Β. Roche, Pergamon Press: New York (1987). It is intended that these references, and any others cited throughout this specification, are incorporated herein by reference. These also include biodegradable polymer derivatives of the compounds according to the invention, as described, for example, in Int. J. Pharm. 115, 61-67 (1995). The formula (I) and related formulae also encompasses mixtures of the compounds of the formula I, for example mixtures of two diastereomers, for example in the ratio 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:10, 1:100 or 1:1000. These are particularly preferably mixtures of stereoisomeric compounds. Pharmaceutical formulations can be administered in the form of dosage units, which comprise a predetermined amount of active ingredient per dosage unit. Such a unit can comprise, for example, 0.5 mg to 1 g, preferably 1 mg to 700 mg, particularly preferably 5 mg to 100 mg, of a compound according to the invention, depending on the disease condition treated, the method of administration and the age, weight and condition of the patient, or pharmaceutical formulations can be administered in the form of dosage units which comprise a predetermined amount of active ingredient per dosage unit. Preferred dosage unit formulations are those which comprise a daily dose or part-dose, as indicated above, or a corresponding fraction thereof of an active ingredient. Furthermore, pharmaceutical formulations of this type can be prepared using a process, which is generally known in the pharmaceutical art. Pharmaceutical formulations can be adapted for administration via any desired suitable method, for example by oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual or transdermal), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or intradermal) methods. Such formulations can be prepared using all processes known in the pharmaceutical art by, for example, combining the active ingredient with the excipient(s) or adjuvant(s). Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration can be administered as separate units, such as, for example, capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or foam foods; or oil-in-water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil liquid emulsions. Thus, for example, in the case of oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active-ingredient component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable inert excipient, such as, for example, ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Powders are prepared by comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing it with a pharmaceutical excipient comminuted in a similar manner, such as, for example, an edible carbohydrate, such as, for example, starch or mannitol. A flavour, preservative, dispersant and dye may likewise be present. Capsules are produced by preparing a powder mixture as described above and filling shaped gelatine shells therewith. Glidants and lubricants, such as, for example, highly disperse silicic acid, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate or polyethylene glycol in solid form, can be added to the powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrant or solubiliser, such as, for example, agar-agar, calcium carbonate or sodium carbonate, may likewise be added in order to improve the availability of the medica-ment after the capsule has been taken. In addition, if desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants and disintegrants as well as dyes can likewise be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatine, natural sugars, such as, for example, glucose or beta-lactose, sweeteners made from maize, natural and synthetic rubber, such as, for example, acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like. The lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. The disintegrants include, without being restricted thereto, starch, methylcellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like. The tablets are formulated by, for example, preparing a powder mixture, granulating or dry-pressing the mixture, adding a lubricant and a disintegrant and pressing the entire mixture to give tablets. A powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound comminuted in a suitable manner with a diluent or a base, as described above, and optionally with a binder, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, an alginate, gelatine or polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, a dissolution retardant, such as, for example, paraffin, an absorption accelerator, such as, for example, a quaternary salt, and/or an absorbant, such as, for example, bentonite, kaolin or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting it with a binder, such as, for example, syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage or solutions of cellulose or polymer materials and pressing it through a sieve. As an alternative to granulation, the powder mixture can be run through a tableting machine, giving lumps of non-uniform shape which are broken up to form granules. The granules can be lubricated by addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc or mineral oil in order to prevent sticking to the tablet casting moulds. The lubricated mixture is then pressed to give tablets. The active ingredients can also be combined with a free-flowing inert excipient and then pressed directly to give tablets without carrying out the granulation or dry-pressing steps. A transparent or opaque protective layer consisting of a shellac sealing layer, a layer of sugar or polymer material and a gloss layer of wax may be present. Dyes can be added to these coatings in order to be able to differentiate between different dosage units. Oral liquids, such as, for example, solution, syrups and elixirs, can be prepared in the form of dosage units so that a given quantity comprises a pre-specified amount of the compounds. Syrups can be prepared by dissolving the compounds in an aqueous solution with a suitable flavour, while elixirs are prepared using a non-toxic alcoholic vehicle. Suspensions can be for-mulated by dispersion of the compounds in a non-toxic vehicle. Solubilisers and emulsifiers, such as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxyethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavour additives, such as, for example, peppermint oil or natural sweeteners or saccharin, or other artificial sweeteners and the like, can likewise be added. The dosage unit formulations for oral administration can, if desired, be encapsulated in microcapsules. The formulation can also be prepared in such a way that the release is extended or retarded, such as, for example, by coating or embedding of particulate material in polymers, wax and the like. The compounds of the formula (I), and related formulae and salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives thereof and the other active ingredients can also be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as, for example, small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from various phospholipids, such as, for example, cholesterol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines. The compounds of the formula (I), and related formulae and the salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives thereof and the other active ingredients can also be delivered using monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are coupled. The compounds can also be coupled to soluble polymers as targeted medicament carriers. Such polymers may encompass polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropyl-methacrylamidophenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamido-phenol or polyethylene oxide polylysine, substituted by palmitoyl radicals. The compounds may furthermore be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers which are suitable for achieving controlled release of a medicament, for example polylactic acid, poly-epsilon-caprolactone, polyhydroxybutyric acid, poly-orthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydroxypyrans, polycyanoacrylates and crosslinked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for transdermal administration can be administered as independent plasters for extended, close contact with the epidermis of the recipient. Thus, for example, the active ingredient can be delivered from the plaster by iontophoresis, as described in general terms in Pharmaceutical Research, 3(6), 318 (1986). Pharmaceutical compounds adapted for topical administration can be formulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols or oils. For the treatment of the eye or other external tissue, for example mouth and skin, the formulations are preferably applied as topical ointment or cream. In the case of formulation to give an ointment, the active ingredient can be employed either with a paraffinic or a water-miscible cream base. Alternatively, the active ingredient can be formulated to give a cream with an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in-oil base. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical application to the eye include eye drops, in which the active ingredient is dissolved or sus-pended in a suitable carrier, in particular an aqueous solvent. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical application in the mouth encompass lozenges, pastilles and mouthwashes. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for rectal administration can be administered in the form of suppositories or enemas. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for nasal administration in which the carrier substance is a solid comprise a coarse powder having a particle size, for example, in the range 20-500 microns, which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation via the nasal passages from a container containing the powder held close to the nose. Suitable formulations for administration as nasal spray or nose drops with a liquid as carrier substance encompass active-ingredient solutions in water or oil. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for administration by inhalation encompass finely particulate dusts or mists, which can be generated by various types of pressurised dispensers with aerosols, nebulisers or insuf-flators. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for vaginal administration can be administered as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions comprising antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostatics and solutes, by means of which the formulation is rendered isotonic with the blood of the recipient to be treated; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions, which may comprise suspension media and thickeners. The formulations can be administered in single-dose or multidose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and stored in freeze-dried (lyophilised) state, so that only the addition of the sterile carrier liquid, for example water for injection purposes, immediately before use is necessary. Injection solutions and suspensions prepared in accordance with the recipe can be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets. It goes without saying that, in addition to the above particularly mentioned constituents, the formulations may also comprise other agents usual in the art with respect to the particular type of formulation; thus, for example, formulations which are suitable for oral administration may comprise flavours. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the formula (I), and related formulae and of the other active ingredient depends on a number of factors, including, for example, the age and weight of the animal, the precise disease condition which requires treatment, and its severity, the nature of the formulation and the method of administration, and is ultimately determined by the treating doctor or vet. However, an effective amount of a compound is generally in the range from 0.1 to 100 mg/kg of body weight of the recipient (mammal) per day and particularly typically in the range from 1 to 10 mg/kg of body weight per day. Thus, the actual amount per day for an adult mammal weighing 70 kg is usually between 70 and 700 mg, where this amount can be administered as an individual dose per day or usually in a series of part-doses (such as, for example, two, three, four, five or six) per day, so that the total daily dose is the same. An effective amount of a salt or solvate or of a physiologically functional derivative thereof can be determined as the fraction of the effective amount of the compound per se. The present invention furthermore relates to a method for treating a subject suffering from a IRAK related disorder, comprising administering to said subject an effective amount of a compound of formula I and related formulae. The present invention preferably relates to a method, wherein the IRAK associated disorder is an autoimmune disorder or condition associated with an overactive immune response or cancer.
