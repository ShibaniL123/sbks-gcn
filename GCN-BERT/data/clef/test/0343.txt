Step 2: Preparation of N,N-diethyl-4-(3-hydroxyprop-1-ynyl)benzamide
N,N-diethyl-4-(3-hydroxyprop-1-ynyl)benzamide was obtained (425 mg, 67% yield) by the same method as described in Step 3 of Example 1 using the 4-bromo-N,N-diethylbenzamide (700 mg, 2.73 mmol) obtained in Step 1 and propargyl alcohol (0.32 ml, 5.47 mmol).
