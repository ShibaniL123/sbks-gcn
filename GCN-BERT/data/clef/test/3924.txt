FIELD The present invention relates to an eyelid speculum device used to retract and hold open a person's upper and lower eyelids to allow access to an eye or eyeball for examination, treatment, ocular surgery, or some other reason. BACKGROUND In most ophthalmic procedures, a first step is to gain secure access to the surgical field in a way that is not painful to the patient. For decades this has been done with a variety of eyelid retractors commonly referred to as speculums. Speculums are usually constructed from stainless steel and have “blades” at the end of two arms, which slip underneath the eyelids. These blades are then mechanically or spring activated to open the eyelids during surgery. Since the anatomy and orbital construct of each patient is different a variety of speculums exist. The most common speculums on the market are produced entirely from wire and are simple and inexpensive. One problem with wire speculums is that the wire weakens over time lessening the strength to keep the lids properly retracted. Most patients are awake during cataract surgery leading to a second problem with wire speculums in that the patient has the ability to squint thereby limiting the surgical field. Another problem is that the blades open from a single pivot point causing the lids to be retracted in a “V” shape. The part of the blade furthest from the pivot point opens wider than the end closest to the pivot point. The result is that the inferior and superior aspects of the blades are spaced apart with different distances. A variety of mechanical speculums are on the market that attempt to both open the lids to the extent desired and to control a “squinter”. Most of these speculums utilize a screw mechanism and a single pivot point to retract the lids. These speculums suffer from the same “V” shape opening problem as the wire speculums. Cataract surgery performed with a femtosecond laser is one of the newest technologies available to eye surgeons. The unprecedented accuracy that the femtosecond laser affords a surgeon can produce better surgical outcomes and improved healing and vision for the patient. One of the challenges to femtosecond laser technology is to provide for “docking” the laser to the patient eye. This is done through an interface device on the bottom of the laser that aspirates onto the patient's eye. Docking is not always the easiest task since many patients have astigmatism, i.e., an irregularly shaped cornea. In addition, prior art speculums can also cause a misshapen cornea due to cornea pressure from the blades of the speculum. Cornea pressure from the blades of the speculum is a two-fold problem. First the single pivot point of prior art speculum blades causes the inferior portion of the blades to be further apart than the superior portion of the blades. Second the blades themselves are straight and press into the globe creating pressure and distortion. SUMMARY In accordance with the principles of the invention, an embodiment of an eyelid speculum for retracting a pair of eyelids, comprises: a first arm having a first blade portion contoured to generally conform to an eyeball globe and one of the pair of eyelids; a second arm having a second blade portion contoured to generally conform to the eyeball globe an the other of the pair of eyelids; and a mechanism carrying the first arm and the second arm.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 depicts a conventional prior art eyelid speculum 100, that is used to access the eye during ophthalmic procedures by spreading the eye's eyelids. Speculum 100 comprises a single wire 101, of circular cross-section, bent to provide two arms 103, 105. Each arm at its distal end comprises a wire blade 103a, 105a to engage the eyelids of a patient. In use, arms 103, 105 are squeezed together and blades 103a, 105a are inserted under the margins of a patient's eyelids. Arms 103, 105 are released and speculum 100 returns to the open configuration shown in FIG. 1 and arms 103, 105 carry blades 103a, 105a to the position shown. In that position the eyelids, which are not shown, of the patient are spread open thereby exposing the ocular surface of the patient's eye. Because arms 103, 105 are connected at apex 107, blades 103a, 105a are carried along an arc Z as arms 103, 105 are released from the squeezed together position. Another prior art speculum 200 shown in FIG. 2 has a pair of arms 203, 205 that are connected to one another by an adjusting device 209. Adjusting device 209 may be an adjustable screw mechanism having a screw 211 threaded through the center of a bridge 213. Each arm 203, 205 is pivotally attached to bridge 213 at either end of the bridge 213, and a pair of struts 215, 217 are pivotally attached to and extend from the distal end of screw 211. Each strut 215, 217 is also pivotally attached to a respective arm 203, 205 of speculum 200. Rotating screw 211 moves struts 215, 217 that in turn carry arms 203, 205. The free ends 219, 221 of arms 203, 205 may be spaced an adjustable distance from each other along arc Z. Pressure on the arms 203, 205 does not rotate screw 211. the geometry of the adjusting device 209 fixes the adjustable distance until the screw 211 is rotated. Speculum 200 has a pair of scoops or blades 223, 225. Blades 223, 225 extend from the free end 219, 221 of each arm 203, 205, respectively. Each blade 223, 225 is generally curved or U-shaped in cross section to engage eyelids of a patient. Blades 223, 225 extend generally posteriorly or toward an eyeball from the free ends 219, 221 of arms 203, 205 when speculum 200 engages the eye of the patient A problem with both of these types of prior art speculums is that the blades 103a, 105a and 223, 225 open from a single pivot point 107, 227 causing the lids to be retracted in a “V” shape. The part of each blade 103a, 105a and 223, 225 furthest from the pivot point X 107, 227 opens wider than the end closest to the pivot point 107, 227. The result is that the inferior and superior aspects of the blades 103a, 105a and 223, 225 are spaced apart with different distances, causing the patient's eyelids to be opened in a “V” configuration. Turning now to FIG. 3, an embodiment of an eyelid speculum 300 for retracting a pair of eyelids in accordance with the principles of the invention is shown. Speculum 300 comprises a first arm 303 and a second arm 305. First arm 303 comprises a first blade 307 contoured to generally conform to an eyeball globe and one of the pair of eyelids. Likewise, second arm 305 comprises a second blade 309 contoured to generally conform to the eyeball globe and the other eyelid of the pair of eyelids. First blade 307 comprises an inferior aspect 313 and a superior aspect 315. Second blade 309 likewise comprises an inferior aspect 317 and a superior aspect 319. Speculum 300 also comprises a mechanism 311 carrying first arm 303 and second arm 305.

Third portion 377 has a knurled surface to facilitate gripping the surface for rotation. FIGS. 6 and 7 illustrate how mechanism 311 moves away from the surgical field 600 as mechanism 311 is moved from an initial position shown in FIG. 6 where the eyelids are not retracted to full retraction and in FIG. 7 where the eyelids are retracted fully. In particular, the distance d3 from the surgical field 600 is greater in FIG. 7 where mechanism 311 is in the eyelid retracted position than the distance d3 in FIG. 6 where mechanism 311 is not in the eyelid retracted position. This is the opposite of the way standard mechanical speculums operate where the mechanism moves toward the surgical field and, in some instances, can hinder access. Also shown in FIGS. 6 and 7 is that the distance d1 between superior aspects 315, 319 and distance d2 between inferior aspects 313, 321 of blades 321, 323 are equal in the first position in FIG. 6 and in the eyelid retracted position of FIG. 7. Turning now to FIG. 8, a portion of one of the arms is shown in side view. More specifically FIG. 8 shows a portion of arm 303 is shown. One additional structural feature of speculum 300 is that arm portion 303a and arm portion 303b are not in the same plane, but are in separate planes at a predetermined angle a, which in this embodiment is 135°, with respect to each other. Advantageously by having the adjusting mechanism 311 in a separate plane from the plane defined by arm portions 303b, 305b, mechanism 311 is further removed from surgical field 600. Preferably, the speculum 10 is constructed from one or more durable, lightweight materials that are easily formed and machined, and that may be readily sterilized. Such materials may include titanium or a titanium-based alloy, surgical stainless steel and high strength plastic, although one skilled in the art will recognize that other materials may be employed with similar effect.
