Intermediate 3: 7-Methyl-5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-indazole
Step A: 5-Bromo-7-methyl-1-((2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy)methyl)-1H-indazole
To a cooled (0° C.) solution of 5-bromo-7-methyl-1H-indazole (1 g, 4.7 mmol) in THF (10.0 mL) was added portion wise sodium hydride (284 mg, 60 wt % in mineral oil, 7.1 mmol). Stirring was maintained for 20 minutes at same temperature and then added (2-(chloromethoxy) ethyl) trimethylsilane (0.84 mL, 4.7 mmol), drop wise over a period of 10 minutes. The mixture was warmed to rt and stirred for 2 hours. The crude mixture was diluted with water and extracted with DCM (×2). The combined organic extracts were washed with brine, dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated in vacuo. Purification (FCC; SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) provided the title compound as a white solid (755 mg, 47%).
