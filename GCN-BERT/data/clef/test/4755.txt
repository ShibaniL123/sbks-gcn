Inhibitors of the HIV viral protease have been developed relatively recently and their use began only in 1996. Currently, they arc considered the most effective drugs against HIV infection. Unfortunately, most current proteases inhibitors are relatively large hydrophobic molecules that possess rather low bioavailability. A high pill burden is therefore required to attain the therapeutic dose in a patient. This is a deterrent, which too often results in patient non-compliance and inadequate treatment results. This situation leads to sub-optimal therapeutic drug concentration that in turns leads to the development of HIV resistant strains. Consequently, there is an urgent need to improve the solubility and bioavailability of proteases inhibitors. Protease inhibitors have also been developed in the form of prodrugs such as those described, for example, in US patent no. 6,436,989 to Hale el at, the entire content of which incorporated herein by reference. These prodrugs possess favourable aqueous solubility, high oral bioavailability and allow the in vivo generation of the active ingredient. However, it well known that HIV has the ability to develop resistance to the currently available drugs. A need remains for alternative HIV protease inhibitors active towards wild-type and resistant viral strains and which shows enhanced solubility and bioavailability. The synthesis of a unique class of aromatic derivatives which are inhibitors of aspartyl proteases is described in US patent no. 6,632,816 to Stranix et al, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference. This patent includes, more particularly, //.-synthetic amino acid substituted L-lysine derivatives possessing potent aspartyl protease inhibitory properties. Lysine based compounds demonstrating enhanced aqueous solubility and bioavailability as well as their method of preparation have also been described in U.S application No. 09/902,935 (Stranix et al.,) published February 2nd, 2006 under publication No.US2006/0025592Al. Efficient and improved route of synthesizing these compounds are needed in order to develop commercially-viable processes. A desirable route of synthesis should produce the compounds in a good yield, with the minimum number of step possible and in a manner that is of minimum impact to the environment in terms of disposing of waste-materials. Intermediate compounds are also of help in facilitating the synthesis of end compounds. There thus remains a need for optimizing synthesis of lysine based compounds. The present invention seeks to meet these and other needs.

Scheme 2A illustrates a generic example for the preparation of the phosphate monoester 111, a compound of HIV protease inhibitors, with a different approach starting from (3S)-3isobutyIamino-azepan-2-one {IV). Note: a) R2 and Rj are as defined herein. As shown in scheme 2 A, the phosphate monoester derivative HI was obtained from isobutylamino-azepan-2-one (IV) in a seven-step reaction sequence. Initially, (2S)-3isobutylamino-azepan-2-one (IV) was sulfonated with 4-acetamidobenzenesuIfonyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine in dichloromelhane to give compound V in excellent yields. The derivative VI was obtained quantitatively upon treatment of V with di-/er/-butyl pyrocarbonate and DMAP in acetonitrile. The reductive ring opening with sodium borohydride in ethanol lead to key intermediates VII in good yield. The diethyl phosphotriester VIII was obtained in good yield upon treatment with diethyl chlorophosphate and sodium hydride in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and triethylphosphate. The Boc protective groups were removed upon treatment with HC1 in ethanol to give compound IX quantitatively (T.W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1999). Then, coupling of the free amino group present on intermediate IX with a variety of synthetic amino acid in the presence of' ] - hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and l-[3-(dimethyIamino)propyl]-3-cthylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC) led to derivative II in good to excellent yields. Finally, addition of trimcthysilyl bromide in dichloromethane (DCM) gave compound III in good to excellent yields.

This improved process yield 50-55% of III (scheme 2B). XZ From an industrial point of view, the sequence offers an advantageously less expensive, less complex and shorter process for the preparation of III and uses chemicals that are less harmful to the environment.

The compound XVI J I, was recovered in a yield ranging from to 80 %. Hydrolysis of the carbamate protecting group, carried out, for example, in methyl iso-butyl ketone at 50°C or in methyl tert-butyl ketone at 55°C in the presence of concentrated hydrochloric acid, gives the water soluble hydrochloric salt of phosphate mono ester XIX in good to excellent yield. Acylation of XIX with an amino acid was performed under aqueous conditions as reported by Anderson et al. in the J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964, 1839 and afforded compound III in good yield. The use of methyl tert-butyl ketone solvent may facilitate the direct extraction of this intermediate in the aqueous phase. The pH controlled aqueous solution above may, for example, be treated with 2methoxycarbonylamino-3,3-diphenyl-propionic acid 2,5-di,oxo-pyrrolidin-l-yl ester. Compound PL-461 free acid may be precipitated from reaction mixture by acidification with diluted aqueous hydrochloric acid. Finally, PL-461 (Na)2 may be obtained by recrystallization of crude PL-461 free acid in 1% aqueous sodium chloride solution at pH 910(81% yield). Scheme 2C presents the synthesis of a specific compound; (l-{5-[4-Amino-benzenesulfonyl)- isobutyl-amino]-6-phosphonooxy-hexylcarbamoyl}-2,2-diphenyI-ethyl)-carbamic acid methyl ester ( MB: PL-461) based on the general synthesis presented in Scheme 2B.

Furthermore, the concomitant hydrolytic removal of the four ester groups and N-dephosphorylation of the resulting intermediate, necessitate an excess of corrosive and hazardous bromotrimethylsilane (up to 4L per kg of product treated) in large volume of dichloromethane. As a consequence, isolation and purification of this intermediate is technically complex. Scheme 3 presents the transformation of a diphenylmethyl derivative; (15,55)-(l-{5-[(4amino-benzenesulfonyl)-isobutyl-amino]-6-hydroxy-hexylcarbarnoyl}-2, 2-diphenyl-ethyl)- carbamic acid methyl ester (PL -100) into its iluorinated phosphate monoester sodium salt analog XI. This reaction sequence may be used to produce any other similar compounds (compounds) made of unsubstituted (or substituted) diphenylmethyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, biphenyl and 9-anthryl groups described in this invention. Thus, the treatment of PL-100 with Selectfluor™ in acetonitrile gave derivative X in 38% yield. The introduction oF the phosphate monoester group was performed as described previously in scheme 1 and 2A. First, the diethyl phosphotriester intermediate was obtained in good yield upon treatment with diethyl chlorophosphate and sodium hydride in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and triethylphosphate. Secondly, addition of trimethysilyl bromide in dichloromethane (DCM) gave the phosphate monoester compound in good to excellent yields. The final product XI was easily obtained upon treatment of the phosphate monoester with a solution of sodium hydroxide with good yields.

This generic example represents a second approach for the synthesis of fluorinated compounds of this invention. In this case, the fluorine atom is added to the phosphotriester II instead of the primary alcohol derivative of general formula I or, more specifically, PL-100 as shown on scheme 3. This alternate reaction sequence may be used to produce any other similar compounds made of unsubstituted (or substituted) diphenylmethyl, 1-naphthyl, 2-naphthyl, biphenyl and 9-anthryl groups described in this invention. Note: a) R.2 and R3 are as defined herein. Briefly, treatment of derivative II with Selectfluor™ in acetonitrile gave derivative XII in good yields. Then, addition of trimethysilyl bromide in dichloromethane (DCM) gave the phosphate monoester compound XIII in good excellent yields. If desired, the final product XIII may be easily transformed into the phosphate monoester sodium salt analog as described before in scheme 3. Scheme 4 EtO-P-OEt Selectfluor, MeCN EtO-P-OEt XII TMSBr HPLC HO-P-OH As it may be appreciated by the person skilled in the art, the above synthetic schemes are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all means by which the compound described and claimed in this application may be synthesized but only represent exemplification of synthesis methods among others. Further methods will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art. The compounds of this invention may be modified by appending appropriate functionalities to enhance selective biological properties. Such modifications are known in the art and include those which increase biological penetration into a given biological system (e.g., blood, lymphatic system, central nervous system), increase oral availability, increase solubility to allow administration by injection, alter metabolism and alter rate of excretion. As discussed above, the novel compounds may release the active ingredients that are excellent ligands for aspartyl proteases, for example, HIV-1 protease. Accordingly, these compounds are, by releasing the active ingredient, capable of targeting and inhibiting late stage events in the replication, i.e. the processing of the viral polyproteins by HIV encoded protease. Compounds according to this invention advantageously inhibit the ability of the HIV-1 virus to infect immortalized human T cells over a period of days, as determined by an assay measuring the amount of extracellular p24 antigen; a specific marker of viral replication (see, Meek et a!., Nature, 343, pp. 90-92 (1990)). In addition to their use in the prophylaxis or treatment of HIV or HTLV infection, the compounds according to this invention may also be used as inhibitory or interruptive agents for other viruses which use aspartyl proteases, similar to HIV or HTLV aspartyl proteases, in their life cycle. Such compounds inhibit the proteolytic processing of viral polyprotein precursors by inhibiting aspartyl protease. Because aspartyl protease is essential for the production of mature virions, inhibition of that processing effectively blocks the spread of virus by inhibiting the production and reproduction of infectious virions, particularly from acutely and chronically infected cells. The compounds of this invention advantageously inhibit aspartyl proteases, thus blocking the ability of aspartyl proteases to catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds. The compounds of this invention may be employed in a conventional manner for the treatment or prevention of HIV, HTLV, and other viral infections, which involve aspartyl proteases for their life (replication) cycle. Such methods of treatment, their dosage levels and requirements may be selected by those of ordinary skill in the art from available methods and techniques. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant for administration to a virally infected patient in a pharmaceutically acceptable manner and in an amount effective to lessen the severity of the viral infection. Alternatively, the compounds of this invention may be used in vaccines and methods for protecting individuals against viral infection over an extended period of time. The compounds may be employed in such vaccines either alone or together with other compounds of this invention in a manner consistent with the conventional utilization of protease inhibitors or protease inhibitors derivatives in vaccines. For example, a compound of this invention may be combined with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants, or delivery systems conventionally employed in vaccines and administered in prophylactically effective amounts to protect individuals over an extended period of time against viral infections, such as HIV infection. As such, the novel compounds of the present invention (upon cleavage of a physiologically cleavable unit) may be administered as agents for treating or preventing viral infections, including HIV infection, in a mammal. The compounds of this invention may be administered to a healthy or HIV-infected patient (before or after the onset of AIDS symptoms) either as a single agent or in combination with other antiviral agents which interfere with the replication cycle of HIV. By administering the compounds of this invention with other antiviral agents which target different events in the viral life cycle, the therapeutic effect of these compounds is potentiated. For instance, the coadministered antiviral agent may be one which targets early events in the viral life cycle, such as attachment to the cell receptor and cell entry, reverse transcription and viral DNA integration into cellular DNA. Antiviral agents targeting such early life cycle events include among others polysulfated polysaccharides, sT4 (soluble CD4) and other compounds which block binding of virus to CD4 receptors on CD4 bearing T-lymphocytes and other CD4(+) cells, or inhibit fusion of the viral envelope with the cytoplasmic membrane, and didanosine (ddl), zalcitabine (ddC), stavudine (d4T), zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC) which inhibit reverse transcription. For example another protease inhibitor may be used with compounds of the present invention. Other anti-retroviral and antiviral drugs may also be coadministered with the compounds of this invention to provide therapeutic treatment for substantially reducing or eliminating viral infectivity and the symptoms associated therewith. Examples of other antiviral agents include ganciclovir, dideoxycytidine, trisodium phosphonoformate, efiornithine, ribavirin, acyclovir, alpha interferon and trimenotrexatc. Additionally, other types of drugs may be used to potentiate the effect of the compounds of this invention, such as viral uncoating inhibitors, inhibitors of Tat or Rev trans-activating proteins, antisense molecules or inhibitors of the viral integrase. These compounds may also be co-administered with other inhibitors of HIV aspartyl protease. Furthermore, it may be found useful to administer compounds of the present invention with any other drug (other anti-viral compounds, antibiotics, pain killer, etc.,). Combination therapies according to this invention exert a synergistic effect in inhibiting HIV replication because each component agent of the combination acts on a different site of HIV replication. The use of such combinations also advantageously reduces the dosage of a given conventional anti-retroviral agent that would be required for a desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect as compared to when that agent is administered as a monotherapy. These combinations may reduce or eliminate the side effects of conventional single anti-retroviral agent therapies while not interfering with the anti-retroviral activity of those agents. These combinations reduce the potential of resistance to single agent therapies, while minimizing any associated toxicity. These combinations may also increase the efficacy of the conventional agent without increasing the associated toxicity. Combination therapies encompassed by the present invention include, for example, the administration of a compound of this invention with AZT, 3TC, ddl, ddC, d4T or other reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Alternatively, the compounds of this invention may also be co-admini stored with other HIV protease inhibitors such as Ro 31-8959 (Saquinavir; Roche), L-735,524 (Indinavir; Merck), AG-1343 (Nelfmavir; Agouron), A-84538 (Ritonavir; Abbott), ABT-378/r (Lopinavir; Abbott), and VX-478 (Amprenavir; Glaxo) to increase the effect of therapy or prophylaxis against various viral mutants or members of other HIV quasi species. Administration of compounds of the present invention may be performed, for example, as single agents or in combination with retroviral reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or other HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors. Co-administration of the compounds of this invention with retroviral reverse transcriptase inhibitors or HIV aspartyl protease inhibitors may exert a substantial synergistic effect, thereby preventing, substantially reducing, or completely eliminating viral infectivity and its associated symptoms. The compounds of the present invention may be administered in such a manner or form which may allow cleavage of the R| unit to release a protease inhibitor. The compounds of this invention may also be administered, for example, in combination with immunomodulators (e.g., bropirimine, anti-human alpha interferon antibody, IL-2, GM-CSF, methionine enkephalin, interferon alpha, diethyldithiocarbamate sodium, tumor necrosis factor, naltrexone and rEPO) antibiotics (e.g., pentamidine isethionate) or vaccines to prevent or combat infection and disease associated with HIV infection, such as AIDS and ARC. When the compounds of this invention are administered in combination therapies with other agents, they may be administered sequentially or concurrently to the patient. Alternatively, pharmaceutical or prophylactic compositions according to this invention may be comprised of a combination of one or more compounds of this invention and another therapeutic or prophylactic agent. Although this invention focuses on the use of the compounds disclosed herein for preventing and treating HIV infection, the compounds of this invention may also be used as inhibitory agents for other viruses that depend on similar aspartyl proteases for obligatory events in their life cycle. These viruses include, but are not limited to, retroviruses causing AIDS-like diseases such as simian immunodeficiency viruses, HIV-2, HTLV-I and HTLV-II. In addition, the compounds of this invention may also be used to inhibit other aspartyl proteases and, in particular, other human aspartyl proteases including renin and aspartyl proteases that process endothelin precursors.

Step A. Preparation of (35)-3-isobutylamino-azepan-2-one (IV) L-a-amino-,-caprolactam (22.0 g) was dissolved in cold dichloroethane (DCM, 200 mL). isobutyraldehyde (12.6 g) was added slowly and stirred until the heat evolved was dissipated (water forms at the surface). The cold solution was added to 46.5 g of powdered NaBH(OAc)3 in DCM (0.5 L). AcOH (70 mL) was added to the solution. The slightly turbid mixture was stirred at 20 °C for 4 h. A 500 mL. solution of 2M NaOH was added slowly to the turbid mixture and the pH adjusted to 1 1 using a concentrated NaOH solution, and then the mixture stirred for a further 20 min. After extraction, the DCM layer was dried with MgS04, filtered and evaporated.
