Example 12. Preparation of PAG-2
A 100 mL flask was charged with 1,1-difluoro-2-oxo-2-(phenylamino)ethane-1-sulfonyl fluoride (SM-1) (0.97 g, 3.89 mmol, 1.0 eq.), 2-hydroxy-4'-methoxyacetophenone (SM-4) (0.64 g, 3.98 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and THF (20 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −30° C. n-BuLi (1.6 M, 2.4 mL, 3.89 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added drop wise to the mixture over 10 minutes. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours at −30° C. to 10° C. 1N HCl (20 mL) was added to the final reaction mixture and then AcOEt (60 mL) was added. The upper layer was separated and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 aq./brine (20 mL/20 mL) and brine (20 mL) and the solution was subsequently dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. Solvents were removed in an evaporator and then CH2Cl2 (50 mL) was added to the residue and the sodium salt separated was removed by filtration and the filtrate was concentrated in an evaporator. The concentrate was then washed with 3×50 mL hexane and the hexane was removed by decantation. This crude material was purified by column chromatography (hexane/AcOEt) followed by recrystallization (hexane/AcOEt, 50° C. to 0° C.) to obtain the target PAG as a white solid (0.49 g) in 31.2% yield.
