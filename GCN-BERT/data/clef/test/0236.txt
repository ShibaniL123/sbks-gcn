REDUCING SYSTEMIC REGULATORY T CELL LEVELS OR ACTIVITY FOR TREATMENT OF DISEASE AND INJURY OF THE CNS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates in general to methods and compositions for treating disease, disorder, condition or injury of the Central Nervous System (CNS) by transiently reducing the level of systemic immunosuppression in the circulation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Most central nervous system (CNS) pathologies share a common neuroinflammatory component, which is part of disease progression, and contributes to disease escalation. Among these pathologies is Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognitive functions, in which accumulation of amyloid-beta (Αβ) peptide aggregates was suggested to play a key role in the inflammatory cascade within the CNS, eventually leading to neuronal damage and tissue destruction (Akiyama et al, 2000; Hardy & Selkoe, 2002; Vom Berg et al, 2012). Despite the chronic neuroinflammatory response in neurodegenerative diseases, clinical and pre-clinical studies over the past decade, investigating immunosuppression-based therapies in neurodegenerative diseases, have raised the question as to why anti-inflammatory drugs fall short (Breitner et al, 2009; Group et al, 2007; Wyss-Coray & Rogers, 2012). We provide a novel answer that overcomes the drawbacks of existing therapies of AD and similar diseases and injuries of the CNS; this method is based on our unique understanding of the role of the different components of systemic and central immune system in CNS maintenance and repair. SUMMARY OF INVENTION In one aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an active agent that causes reduction of the level of systemic immunosuppression in an individual for use in treating a disease, disorder, condition or injury of the CNS that does not include the autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease, relap sing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), wherein said pharmaceutical composition is for administration by a dosage regimen comprising at least two courses of therapy, each course of therapy comprising in sequence a treatment session followed by an interval session of non-treatment. In another aspect, the present invention provides method for treating a disease, disorder, condition or injury of the Central Nervous System (CNS) that does not include the autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), said method comprising administering to an individual in need thereof a pharmaceutical composition according to any one of claims 1 to 24, wherein said pharmaceutical composition is administered by a dosage regime comprising at least two courses of therapy, each course of therapy comprising in sequence a treatment session followed by an interval session of a non-treatment period.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION It has been found in accordance with the present invention that a short-term transient depletion of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD-Tg mice) results in improved recruitment of leukocytes to the CNS through the brain's choroid plexus, elevated numbers of CNS -infiltrating anti-inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages mo-ΜΦ and CD4+ T cells, and a marked enrichment of Foxp3+ Tregs that accumulates within the brain. Furthermore, the long-term effect of a single session of treatment lead to a reduction in hippocampal gliosis and reduced mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines within the brain. Importantly, the effect on disease pathology includes reduced cerebral amyloid beta (Αβ) plaque burden in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, and the cerebral cortex (5th layer), two brain regions exhibiting robust Αβ plaque pathology in the AD-Tg mice. Most importantly, the short-term transient depletion of Tregs is followed by a dramatic improvement in spatial learning and memory, reaching cognitive performance similar to that of wild type mice (Examples 2 and 3). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that a short session of Treg depletion, followed by a period of no intervention, results in transiently breaking Treg-mediated systemic immune suppression in AD-Tg mice, which enables recruitment of inflammation-resolving cells, mo-ΜΦ and Tregs, to the brain, and lead to resolution of the neuroinflammatory response, clearance of Αβ, and reversal of cognitive decline. These findings strongly argue against the common wisdom in this field of research, according to which increasing systemic immune suppression would result in mitigation of the neuroinflammatory response. On the contrary, our findings show that boosting of the systemic response, by a short-term, brief and transient, reduction in systemic Treg-mediated suppression, is needed in order to achieve inflammation-resolving immune cell accumulation, including Tregs themselves, within the brain, thus fighting off AD pathology. The specificity of the inventors approach presented herein has been substantiated by using several independent experimental paradigms, as detailed below. Briefly, first the inventors used an immunomodulatory compound in two different administration regimens that led to opposite effects on peripheral Treg levels, on CP activation, and on disease pathology; a daily administration regimen that augments peripheral Treg levels (Weber et al, 2007), and a weekly administration regimen, which they found to reduce peripheral Treg levels (Example 3 and Example 5). The inventors also provide a direct functional linkage between peripheral Treg levels and disease pathology when demonstrating in AD-Tg mice, by either transient in vivo genetic depletion of Tregs (Example 2), or by pharmacologic inhibition of their Foxp3 function (Examples 3 and 4), that these manipulations result in activation of the CP for facilitating leukocyte trafficking to the CNS, inflammation-resolving immune cell accumulation at sites of pathology, clearance of cerebral Αβ plaques, and skewing of the immunological milieu of the brain parenchyma towards the resolution of inflammation. It has further been found in accordance with the present invention that infrequent administration of a universal antigen, Copolymer- 1, for a limited period of time (representing one session of treatment) reduces Treg-mediated systemic immune suppression, and improves selective infiltration of leukocytes into the CNS by increasing the brain's choroid plexus gateway activity, leading to dramatic beneficial effect in Alzheimer's disease pathology (Example 3), while daily administration of Copolymer 1, that enhance Treg immune suppression (Hong et al, 2005; Weber et al, 2007), showed no beneficial effect, or even some modest detrimental effect, on disease pathology (Example 5). The inventors of the present invention further show herein that direct interference with Foxp3 Treg activity, either by inhibition of p300 with a specific small molecule inhibitor (p300i), or interaction with the PD-1 receptor by an anti-PD-1 antibody, improves choroid plexus gateway activity in AD-Tg mice, and mitigates Alzheimer's disease pathology (Example 4). Importantly, each of these examples provided by the inventors, demonstrate a different intervention which causes short term reduction in systemic immune suppression: Copolymer- 1 acts as an immunomodulatory compound, p300i as a small molecule which decreases Foxp3 acetylation and Treg function, and anti-PD-1 is used as a neutralizing antibody for PD-1 expressed on Tregs. These therapeutic approaches were used for a short session of treatment that transiently augmented immune response in the periphery, mainly by elevation of peripheral IFN- γ levels and IFN-y-producing cells, thus activating the brain's choroid plexus allowing selective infiltration of T cells and monocytes into the CNS, and homing of these cells to sites of pathology and neuroinflammation. It was also found herein that repeated sessions of treatment interrupted by interval sessions of non-treatment dramatically improve the efficacy of the treatment relative to a single session of treatment (Example 4). The following time interval of non-treatment allowed transient augmentation in Treg levels and activities within the brain, facilitating the resolution of neuroinflammation, and inducing environmental conditions in favor of CNS healing and repair, subsequently leading to tissue recovery. In each of these cases the effect on brain pathology was robust, involving the resolution of the neuroinflammatory response, amyloid beta plaque clearance from AD mice brains, and reversal of cognitive decline. The specificity of the current approach has further been substantiated using a genetic model of transient depletion of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, in transgenic mouse model of AD (Example 2). Thus, it has been found in accordance with the present invention that systemic Foxp3+CD4+ Treg-mediated immunosuppression interferes with ability to fight off AD pathology, acting at least in part, by inhibiting IFN-y-dependent activation of the CP, needed for orchestrating recruitment of inflammation-resolving leukocytes to the CNS (Schwartz & Baruch, 2014b). Systemic Tregs are crucial for maintenance of autoimmune homeostasis and protection from autoimmune diseases (Kim et al, 2007). However, our findings suggest that under neurodegenerative conditions, when a reparative immune response is needed in the brain, the ability to mount this response is interfered with by systemic Tregs. Nevertheless according to our results, Tregs are needed within the brain, home to sites of neuropathology, and perform locally an anti-inflammatory activity. The present invention represents a unique and unexpected solution for the apparent contradictory needs in fighting off progressive neuronal death as in AD; transiently reducing/inhibiting Tregs in the circulation on behalf of increasing Tregs in the diseased brain. Hence, a short-term and transient reduction in peripheral immune suppression, which allows the recruitment of anti-inflammatory cells, including Tregs and mo-ΜΦ, to sites of cerebral plaques, leads to a long-term effect on pathology. Notably, however, a transient reduction of systemic Treg levels or activities may contribute to disease mitigation via additional mechanisms, including supporting a CNS-specific protective autoimmune response (Schwartz & Baruch, 2014a), or augmenting the levels of circulating monocytes that play a role in clearance of vascular Αβ (Michaud et al, 2013). Though neurodegenerative diseases of different etiology, share a common local neuroinflammatory component, our results strongly argue against simplistic characterization of all CNS pathologies as diseases that would uniformly benefit from systemic anti-inflammatory therapy. Thus, while autoimmune inflammatory brain pathologies, such as Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), benefit from continuous systemic administration of antiinflammatory and immune-suppressive drugs to achieve long lasting peripheral immune suppression, it will either be ineffective or detrimentally affect (Example 5) pathology in chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as in the case of AD, primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS) and secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS). Moreover, our findings shed light on the misperception regarding the role of systemic vs. tissue-associated Tregs in these pathologies (He & Balling, 2013). Since the immune-brain axis is part of life-long brain plasticity (Baruch et al, 2014), and neurodegenerative diseases are predominantly age- related, our present findings also point to a more general phenomenon, in which systemic immune suppression interferes with brain function. Accordingly, short-term periodic courses of reducing systemic immune suppression may represent a therapeutic or even preventive approach, applicable to a wide range of brain pathologies, including AD and age-associated dementia. Importantly, the inventors approach and findings present herein in AD mouse models, do not directly target any disease- specific factor in AD, such as amyloid beta or tau pathology, but rather demonstrate a novel approach which is expected to be clinically applicable in a wide range of CNS pathologies - transient reduction of systemic Treg-mediated immune suppression in order to augment recruitment of inflammation-resolving immune cells to sites of pathology within the CNS. In view of the unexpected results described above, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an active agent that causes reduction of the level of systemic immunosuppression in an individual for use in treating a disease, disorder, condition or injury of the CNS that does not include the autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease, relapsing- remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), wherein said pharmaceutical composition is for administration by a dosage regimen comprising at least two courses of therapy, each course of therapy comprising in sequence a treatment session followed by an interval session of non- treatment. In certain embodiments, the dosage regimen is calibrated such that the level of systemic immunosuppression is transiently reduced. The term "treating" as used herein refers to means of obtaining a desired physiological effect. The effect may be therapeutic in terms of partially or completely curing a disease and/or symptoms attributed to the disease. The term refers to inhibiting the disease, i.e. arresting or slowing its development; or ameliorating the disease, i.e. causing regression of the disease. The term "non-treatment session" is used interchangeably herein with the term "period of no treatment" and refers to a session during which no active agent is administered to the individual being treated. The term "systemic presence" of regulatory T cells as used herein refers to the presence of the regulatory T cells (as measured by their level or activity) in the circulating immune system, i.e. the blood, spleen and lymph nodes. It is a well-known fact in the field of immunology that the cell population profile in the spleen is reflected in the cell population profile in the blood (Zhao et al, 2007). The present treatment is applicable to both patients that show elevation of systemic immune suppression, as well as to patients that do not show such an elevation. Sometimes the individual in need for the treatment according to the present invention has a certain level of peripheral immunosuppression, which is reflected by elevated frequencies or numbers of Tregs in the circulation, and/or their enhanced functional activity and/or a decrease in IFNy-producing leukocytes and/or decreased proliferation of leukocytes in response to stimulation. The elevation of frequencies or numbers of Tregs can be in total numbers or as percentage of the total CD4 cells. For example, it has been found in accordance with the present invention that an animal model of Alzheimer's disease has higher frequencies of Foxp3 out of CD4 cells as compared with wild-type mice. However, even if the levels of systemic Treg cells is not elevated, their functional activity is not enhanced, the level of IFNy-producing leukocytes is not reduced or the proliferation of leukocytes in response to stimulation is not decreased, in said individual, the method of the present invention that reduces the level or activity of systemic immunosuppression is effective in treating disease, disorder, condition or injury of the CNS that does not include the autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease RRMS. Importantly, said systemic immune suppression can also involve additional immune cell types except of Tregs, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) (Gabrilovich & Nagaraj, 2009). The level of systemic immunosuppression may be detected by various methods that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the level of Tregs may be measured by flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells or T lymphocytes, immunostained either for cellular surface markers or nuclear intracellular markers of Treg (Chen & Oppenheim, 2011), CD45, TCR-β, or CD4 markers of lymphocytes, and measuring the amount of antibody specifically bound to the cells. The functional activity of Tregs may be measured by various assays; For example the thymidine incorporation assay is being commonly used, in which suppression of anti-CD3 mAb stimulated proliferation of CD4+CD25~ T cells (conventional T cells) is measured by [ H]thymidine incorporation or by using CFSE (5-(and 6)- carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester, which is capable of entering the cells; cell division is measured as successive halving of the fluorescence intensity of CFSE). The number of IFNy-producing leukocytes or their activity or their proliferation capacity can easily be assessed by a skilled artisan using methods known in the art; For example, the level of IFNy- producing leukocytes may be measured by flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, following short ex-vivo stimulation and golgi-stop, and immunostaining by IFNy intracellular staining (using e.g., BD Biosciences Cytofix/cytoperm™ fixation/permeabilization kit), by collecting the condition media of these cells and quantifying the level of secreted cytokines using ELISA, or by comparing the ratio of different cytokines in the condition media, for example IL2/IL10, IL2/IL4, INFy/TGFp, etc. The levels of MDSCs in the human peripheral blood easily can be assessed by a skilled artisan, for example by using flow cytometry analysis of frequency of DR7LIN7CDl lb+, DR7LIN7CD15+, DR7LIN7CD33+ and DR(-/low)/CD14+ cells, as described (Kotsakis et al, 2012). In humans, the peripheral/systemic immunosuppression may be considered elevated when the total number of Tregs in the circulation is higher than 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100% or more than in a healthy control population, the percentage of Treg cells out of the total CD4+ cells is elevated by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100% or more than in a healthy control population, or the functional activity of Tregs is elevated by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100% or more than in a healthy control population. Alternatively, the peripheral/systemic immunosuppression may be considered elevated when the level of IFNy- producing leukocytes or their activity is reduced relative to that of a healthy control population by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100%; or the proliferation of leukocytes in response to stimulation is reduced relative to that of a healthy control population by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100%. An agent may be considered an agent that causes reduction of the level of systemic immunosuppression when, upon administration of the agent to an individual, the total number of Tregs in the circulation of this individual is reduced by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100% as compared with the level before administration of the agent, the percentage of Treg cells out of the total CD4+ cells drops by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100% relative to that of a healthy control population or the functional activity of Tregs is reduced by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100% as compared with the level before administration of the agent. Alternatively, an agent may be considered an agent that causes reduction of the level of systemic immunosuppression when, upon administration of the agent to an individual, the total number of rFNy-producing leukocytes or their activity is increased by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100%; or the proliferation of leukocytes in response to stimulation is increased relative to that of a healthy control population by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100%. The agent used according to the present invention may be any agent that down-regulates the level or activity of regulatory T cells or interfere with their activity, but may alternatively be limited to a group of such agents excluding an agent selected from the group consisting of: (i) dopamine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; (ii) a dopamine precursor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; (iii) an agonist of the dopamine receptor type 1 family (Dl-R agonist) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and (iv) an antagonist of the dopamine receptor type 2 family (D2-R antagonist) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, even though these agents are not know for use according to the course of therapy according to the present invention. In certain embodiments, the treatment session comprises administering the pharmaceutical composition to the individual and the treatment session is maintained at least until the level falls below a reference, the administering is paused during the interval session, and the interval session is maintained as long as the level is below the reference. The reference may be selected from (a) the level of systemic presence or activity of regulatory T cells or myeloid- derived suppressor cells measured in the most recent blood sample obtained from said individual before said administering; or (b) the level of systemic presence or activity of regulatory T cells or myeloid-derived suppressor cells characteristic of a population of individuals afflicted with a disease, disorder, condition or injury of the CNS. Alternatively, the treatment session comprises administering the pharmaceutical composition to the individual and the treatment session is maintained at least until the systemic presence or level of IFNy-producing leukocytes, or the rate of proliferation of leukocytes in response to stimulation rises above a reference, the administering is paused during the interval session, and the interval session is maintained as long as said level is above said reference, wherein the reference is selected from (a) the level of systemic presence or activity of IFNy- producing leukocytes, or the rate of proliferation of leukocytes in response to stimulation, measured in the most recent blood sample obtained from said individual before said administering; or (b) the level of systemic presence or activity of IFNy-producing leukocytes, or the rate of proliferation of leukocytes in response to stimulation, characteristic of a population of individuals afflicted with a disease, disorder, condition or injury of the CNS. The length of the treatment and interval sessions may be determined by physicians in clinical trials directed to a certain patient population and then applied consistently to this patient population, without the need for monitoring the level of immunosuppression on a personal basis. In certain embodiments, the treatment session may be between 3 days and four weeks long, for example between one and four weeks long. In certain embodiments, the interval session may be between one week and six months, for example between two weeks and six months long, in particular between 3 weeks and six months long. In the treatments session, the administration of the pharmaceutical composition may be repeated administration, for example the pharmaceutical composition may be administered daily, or once every two, three, four, five or six days, once weekly, once every two weeks, once every three weeks or once every four weeks. These frequencies are applicable to any active agent, may be based on commonly used practices in the art, and may finally be determined by physicians in clinical trials. Alternatively, the frequency of the repeated administration in the treatment session could be adapted according to the nature of the active agent, wherein for example, a small molecule may be administered daily; an antibody may be administered once every 3 days; and copolymer 1 is administered weekly, once every two weeks, once every three weeks or once every four weeks. It should be understood that when an agent, such as copolymer 1, is administered during a treatment session at a relatively low frequency, for example once per week during a treatment session of one month, or once per month during a treatment session of six months, this treatment session is followed by a non-treatment interval session, the length of which is longer than the period between the repeated administrations during the treatment session (i.e. longer than one week or one month, respectively, in this example). The pause of one week or one month between the administrations during the treatment session in this example is not considered an interval session. The lengths of the treatment session and the interval session may be adjusted to the frequency of the administration such that, for example, a frequency of administering the active agent once every 3 days may result in a treatment session of 6 or 9 days and an interval session that is commenced accordingly. As an alternative to a predetermined general treatment regiment, the level of immunosuppression may be calibrated to a desired level for each patient who is being treated (personalized medicine), by monitoring the level or activity of Treg cells (or IFN-y-producing leukocytes or proliferation rate of leukocytes in response to stimulation) individually, and adjusting the treatment session, the frequency of administration and the interval session empirically and personally as determined from the results of the monitoring. Thus, the length of the treatment session may be determined by (a) monitoring the level of systemic presence or activity of regulatory T cells in the individual by measuring the level in a blood sample obtained from the individual within a predetermined time-period following said administering; (b) comparing the level measured in (a) with the reference mentioned above and determining whether the level is different from the reference; (c) deciding, based on the relation of said level measured in (a) to said reference, whether to continue the treatment session by repeating the administering or starting the next interval session by refraining from repeating the administration; and (d) repeating the administering or starting the next interval session according to the decision in (c). Alternatively, the level of IFN-y-producing leukocytes or proliferation rate of leukocytes in response to stimulation may be monitored and compared with an appropriate reference as mentioned above. Similarly, the length of the interval session may be determined by (a) monitoring the level of systemic presence or activity of regulatory T cells in the individual by measuring the level in a blood sample obtained from the individual within a predetermined time-period following said administering; (b) comparing the level measured in (a) with the reference mentioned above and determining whether the level is different from the reference; (c) deciding, based on the relation of said level measured in (a) to said reference, whether to start a new course of therapy by repeating the administering and steps (a) and (b) or to prolong the interval session by repeating only steps (a) and (b); and (d) repeating the administering and steps (a) and (b) or only steps (a) and (b) according to the decision in (c). Alternatively, the level of IFNy-producing leukocytes or proliferation rate of leukocytes in response to stimulation may be monitored and compared with an appropriate reference as mentioned above. In any case, the dosage regimen, i.e. the length of the treatment session and the interval session, is calibrated such that the reduction in the level of immunosuppression, for example as measured by a reduction in the level of systemic presence or activity of regulatory T cells in the individual, is transient. In certain embodiments, the predetermined time-period, i.e. the time passed between the most recent administration of the active agent and the monitoring step, is between 2 days and six months. In certain embodiments, the regulatory T cells that are monitored are CD4+ cells selected from FoxP3+ cells expressing one or more of CD25, CD 127, GITR, CTLA-4 or PD-1; or FoxP3~ cells expressing one or more of CD25, CD 127, GITR, CTLA-4 or PD-1 surface molecules. In particular, a common phenotype of regulatory T cells is CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells or CD4+CD25+FoxP3~ cells.

The HIF-1 regulator may be M30, 5-[N-methyl-N-propargylaminomethyl]-8- hydroxyquinoline described in Zheng et al. (Zheng et al, 2015). In certain embodiments, the agent can be derived from a broad spectrum of antibiotics which targets gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and thereby facilitating immunomodulation of Tregs, e.g. vancomycin which targets gram-positive bacteria and has been shown to reduce Treg levels/activity (Brestoff & Artis, 2013; Smith et al, 2013). In certain embodiments, the agent may be any copolymer that in a certain regimen will lead to down regulation of Tregs such as YFAK, VYAK, VWAK, VEAK, FEAK, FAK, VAK or WAK. As used herein, the terms "Cop-1" and "Copolymer 1" are used interchangeably. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may comprise as active agent a random copolymer that modulates Treg activity or level comprising a suitable quantity of a positively charged amino acid such as lysine or arginine, in combination with a negatively charged amino acid (preferably in a lesser quantity) such as glutamic acid or aspartic acid, optionally in combination with a non-charged neutral amino acid such as alanine or glycine, serving as a filler, and optionally with an amino acid adapted to confer on the copolymer immunogenic properties, such as an aromatic amino acid like tyrosine or tryptophan. Such compositions may include any of those copolymers disclosed in WO 00/05250, the entire contents of which being hereby incorporated herein by reference. More specifically, the composition for use in the present invention comprises at least one copolymer selected from the group consisting of random copolymers comprising one amino acid selected from each of at least three of the following groups: (a) lysine and arginine; (b) glutamic acid and aspartic acid; (c) alanine and glycine; and (d) tyrosine and tryptophan. The copolymers for use in the present invention can be composed of L- or D-amino acids or mixtures thereof. As is known by those of skill in the art, L-amino acids occur in most natural proteins. However, D-amino acids are commercially available and can be substituted for some or all of the amino acids used to make the terpolymers and other copolymers used in the present invention. The present invention contemplates the use of copolymers containing both D- and L- amino acids, as well as copolymers consisting essentially of either L- or D-amino acids. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises Copolymer 1, a mixture of random polypeptides consisting essentially of the amino acids L- glutamic acid (E), L-alanine (A), L-tyrosine (Y) and L-lysine (K) in an approximate ratio of 1.5:4.8: 1:3.6, having a net overall positive electrical charge and of a molecular weight from about 2 KDa to about 40 KDa. In certain embodiments, the Cop 1 has average molecular weight of about 2 KDa to about 20 KDa, of about 4,7 KDa to about 13 K Da, of about 4 KDa to about 8.6 KDa, of about 5 KDa to 9 KDa, or of about 6.25 KDa to 8.4 KDa. In other embodiments, the Cop 1 has average molecular weight of about 13 KDa to about 20 KDa, of about 13 KDa to about 16 KDa or of about 15 KDa to about 16 KDa. Other average molecular weights for Cop 1, lower than 40 KDa, are also encompassed by the present invention. Copolymer 1 of said molecular weight ranges can be prepared by methods known in the art, for example by the processes described in U.S. Patent No. 5,800,808, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in the entirety. The Copolymer 1 may be a polypeptide comprising from about 15 to about 100, or from about 40 to about 80, amino acids in length. In certain embodiments, the Cop 1 is in the form of its acetate salt known under the generic name glatiramer acetate, that has been approved in several countries for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) under the trade name, Copaxone® (a trademark of Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Petach Tikva, Israel). The activity of Copolymer 1 for the pharmaceutical composition disclosed herein is expected to remain if one or more of the following substitutions is made: aspartic acid for glutamic acid, glycine for alanine, arginine for lysine, and tryptophan for tyrosine. In certain embodiments of the invention, the copolymer that modulates Treg activity or level is a copolymer of three different amino acids each from a different one of three groups of the groups (a) to (d). These copolymers are herein referred to as terpolymers. In one embodiment, the copolymer that modulates Treg activity or level is a terpolymer containing tyrosine, alanine, and lysine, hereinafter designated YAK, in which the average molar fraction of the amino acids can vary: tyrosine can be present in a mole fraction of about 0.05- 0.250; alanine in a mole fraction of about 0.3 - 0.6; and lysine in a mole fraction of about 0.1-0.5. The molar ratios of tyrosine, alanine and lysine may be about 0.10:0.54:0.35, respectively. It is possible to substitute arginine for lysine, glycine for alanine, and/or tryptophan for tyrosine. In certain embodiments, the copolymer that modulates Treg activity or level is a terpolymer containing tyrosine, glutamic acid, and lysine, hereinafter designated YEK, in which the average molar fraction of the amino acids can vary: glutamic acid can be present in a mole fraction of about 0.005 - 0.300, tyrosine can be present in a mole fraction of about 0.005-0.250, and lysine can be present in a mole fraction of about 0.3-0.7. The molar ratios of glutamic acid, tyrosine, and lysine may be about 0.26:0.16:0.58, respectively. It is possible to substitute aspartic acid for glutamic acid, arginine for lysine, and/or tryptophan for tyrosine. In certain embodiments, the copolymer that modulates Treg activity or level is a terpolymer containing lysine, glutamic acid, and alanine, hereinafter designated KEA, in which the average molar fraction of the amino acids can vary: glutamic acid can be present in a mole fraction of about 0.005-0.300, alanine in a mole fraction of about 0.005-0.600, and lysine can be present in a mole fraction of about 0.2 - 0.7. The molar ratios of glutamic acid, alanine and lysine may be about 0.15:0.48:0.36, respectively. It is possible to substitute aspartic acid for glutamic acid, glycine for alanine, and/or arginine for lysine. In certain embodiments, the copolymer that modulates Treg activity or level is a terpolymer containing tyrosine, glutamic acid, and alanine, hereinafter designated YEA, in which the average molar fraction of the amino acids can vary: tyrosine can be present in a mole fraction of about 0.005-0.250, glutamic acid in a mole fraction of about 0.005-0.300, and alanine in a mole fraction of about 0.005-0.800. The molar ratios of glutamic acid, alanine, and tyrosine may be about 0.21: 0.65:0.14, respectively. It is possible to substitute tryptophan for tyrosine, aspartic acid for glutamic acid, and/or glycine for alanine. The average molecular weight of the terpolymers YAK, YEK, KEA and YEA can vary between about 2 KDa to 40 KDa, preferably between about 3 KDa to 35 KDa, more preferably between about 5 KDa to 25 KDa. Copolymer 1 and the other copolymers that modulates Treg activity or level may be prepared by methods known in the art, for example, under condensation conditions using the desired molar ratio of amino acids in solution, or by solid phase synthetic procedures. Condensation conditions include the proper temperature, pH, and solvent conditions for condensing the carboxyl group of one amino acid with the amino group of another amino acid to form a peptide bond. Condensing agents, for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, can be used to facilitate the formation of the peptide bond. Blocking groups can be used to protect functional groups, such as the side chain moieties and some of the amino or carboxyl groups against undesired side reactions. For example, the copolymers can be prepared by the process disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,849,550, wherein the N-carboxyanhydrides of tyrosine, alanine, γ-benzyl glutamate and N ε- trifluoroacetyl-lysine are polymerized at ambient temperatures (20°C-26°C) in anhydrous dioxane with diethylamine as an initiator. The γ-carboxyl group of the glutamic acid can be deblocked by hydrogen bromide in glacial acetic acid. The trifluoroacetyl groups are removed from lysine by 1M piperidine. One of skill in the art readily understands that the process can be adjusted to make peptides and polypeptides containing the desired amino acids, that is, three of the four amino acids in Copolymer 1, by selectively eliminating the reactions that relate to any one of glutamic acid, alanine, tyrosine, or lysine. The molecular weight of the copolymers can be adjusted during polypeptide synthesis or after the copolymers have been made. To adjust the molecular weight during polypeptide synthesis, the synthetic conditions or the amounts of amino acids are adjusted so that synthesis stops when the polypeptide reaches the approximate length which is desired. After synthesis, polypeptides with the desired molecular weight can be obtained by any available size selection procedure, such as chromatography of the polypeptides on a molecular weight sizing column or gel, and collection of the molecular weight ranges desired. The copolymers can also be partially hydrolyzed to remove high molecular weight species, for example, by acid or enzymatic hydrolysis, and then purified to remove the acid or enzymes. In one embodiment, the copolymers with a desired molecular weight may be prepared by a process, which includes reacting a protected polypeptide with hydrobromic acid to form a trifluoroacetyl-polypeptide having the desired molecular weight profile. The reaction is performed for a time and at a temperature which is predetermined by one or more test reactions. During the test reaction, the time and temperature are varied and the molecular weight range of a given batch of test polypeptides is determined. The test conditions which provide the optimal molecular weight range for that batch of polypeptides are used for the batch. Thus, a trifluoroacetyl-polypeptide having the desired molecular weight profile can be produced by a process, which includes reacting the protected polypeptide with hydrobromic acid for a time and at a temperature predetermined by test reaction. The trifluoroacetyl-polypeptide with the desired molecular weight profile is then further treated with an aqueous piperidine solution to form a low toxicity polypeptide having the desired molecular weight. In certain embodiments, a test sample of protected polypeptide from a given batch is reacted with hydrobromic acid for about 10-50 hours at a temperature of about 20-28 °C. The best conditions for that batch are determined by running several test reactions. For example, in one embodiment, the protected polypeptide is reacted with hydrobromic acid for about 17 hours at a temperature of about 26°C. As binding motifs of Cop 1 to MS-associated HLA-DR molecules are known (Fridkis- Hareli et al, 1999), polypeptides having a defined sequence can readily be prepared and tested for binding to the peptide binding groove of the HLA-DR molecules as described in the Fridkis- Hareli et al (1999) publication. Examples of such peptides are those disclosed in WO 00/05249 and WO 00/05250, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference, and include the peptides of SEQ ID NOs. 1-32 (Table 2). Such peptides and other similar peptides would be expected to have similar activity as Cop 1. Such peptides, and other similar peptides, are also considered to be within the definition of copolymers that cross-react with CNS myelin antigens and their use is considered to be part of the present invention.

The pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may be for treating a disease, disorder or condition of the CNS that is a neurodegenerative disease, disorder or condition selected from Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease Huntington's disease, primary progressive multiple sclerosis; secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, corticobasal degeneration, Rett syndrome, a retinal degeneration disorder selected from the group consisting of age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa; anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; glaucoma; uveitis; depression; trauma-associated stress or posttraumatic stress disorder, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementias, mild cognitive impairments, posterior cortical atrophy, primary progressive aphasia or progressive supranuclear palsy. In certain embodiments, the condition of the CNS is aged-related dementia. In certain embodiments, the condition of the CNS is Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease Huntington's disease. The pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may further be for treating an injury of the CNS selected from spinal cord injury, closed head injury, blunt trauma, penetrating trauma, hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, cerebral ischemia, optic nerve injury, myocardial infarction, organophosphate poisoning and injury caused by tumor excision As stated above, the inventors have found that the present invention improves the cognitive function in mice that emulates Alzheimer's disease. Thus, the pharmaceutical composition may be for use in improving CNS motor and/or cognitive function, for example for use in alleviating age-associated loss of cognitive function, which may occur in individuals free of a diagnosed disease, as well as in people suffering from neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical composition may be for use in alleviating loss of cognitive function resulting from acute stress or traumatic episode. The cognitive function mentioned herein above may comprise learning, memory or both. The term "CNS function" as used herein refers, inter alia, to receiving and processing sensory information, thinking, learning, memorizing, perceiving, producing and understanding language, controlling motor function and auditory and visual responses, maintaining balance and equilibrium, movement coordination, the conduction of sensory information and controlling such autonomic functions as breathing, heart rate, and digestion. The terms "cognition", "cognitive function" and "cognitive performance" are used herein interchangeably and are related to any mental process or state that involves but is not limited to learning, memory, creation of imagery, thinking, awareness, reasoning, spatial ability, speech and language skills, language acquisition and capacity for judgment attention. Cognition is formed in multiple areas of the brain such as hippocampus, cortex and other brain structures. However, it is assumed that long term memories are stored at least in part in the cortex and it is known that sensory information is acquired, consolidated and retrieved by a specific cortical structure, the gustatory cortex, which resides within the insular cortex. In humans, cognitive function may be measured by any know method, for example and without limitation, by the clinical global impression of change scale (CIBIC-plus scale); the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE); the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI); the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR); the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) or the Sandoz Clinical Assessment-Geriatric (SCAG). Cognitive function may also be measured indirectly using imaging techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), or any other imaging technique that allows one to measure brain function. An improvement of one or more of the processes affecting the cognition in a patient will signify an improvement of the cognitive function in said patient, thus in certain embodiments improving cognition comprises improving learning, plasticity, and/or long term memory. The terms "improving" and "enhancing" may be used interchangeably. The term "learning" relates to acquiring or gaining new, or modifying and reinforcing, existing knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, or preferences. The term "plasticity" relates to synaptic plasticity, brain plasticity or neuroplasticity associated with the ability of the brain to change with learning, and to change the already acquired memory. One measurable parameter reflecting plasticity is memory extinction. The term "memory" relates to the process in which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. Memory has three distinguishable categories: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. The term "long term memory" is the ability to keep information for a long or unlimited period of time. Long term memory comprises two major divisions: explicit memory (declarative memory) and implicit memory (non-declarative memory). Long term memory is achieved by memory consolidation which is a category of processes that stabilize a memory trace after its initial acquisition. Consolidation is distinguished into two specific processes, synaptic consolidation, which occurs within the first few hours after learning, and system consolidation, where hippocampus-dependent memories become independent of the hippocampus over a period of weeks to years. In an additional aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for treating a disease, disorder, condition or injury of the Central Nervous System (CNS) that does not include the autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), said method comprising administering to an individual in need thereof a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention as defined above, wherein said pharmaceutical composition is administered by a dosage regime comprising at least two courses of therapy, each course of therapy comprising in sequence a treatment session followed by an interval session. In certain embodiments, the treatment session comprises administering the pharmaceutical composition to the individual and the treatment session is maintained at least until the level falls below a reference, the administering is paused during the interval session, and the interval session is maintained as long as the level is below the reference. The reference may be selected from (a) the level of systemic presence or activity of regulatory T cells or myeloid- derived suppressor cells measured in the most recent blood sample obtained from said individual before said administering; or (b) the level of systemic presence or activity of regulatory T cells or myeloid-derived suppressor cells characteristic of a population of individuals afflicted with a disease, disorder, condition or injury of the CNS. Alternatively, the treatment session comprises administering the pharmaceutical composition to the individual and the treatment session is maintained at least until the systemic presence or level of IFNy-producing leukocytes, or the rate of proliferation of leukocytes in response to stimulation rises above a reference, the administering is paused during the interval session, and the interval session is maintained as long as said level is above said reference, wherein the reference is selected from (a) the level of systemic presence or activity of IFNy- producing leukocytes, or the rate of proliferation of leukocytes in response to stimulation, measured in the most recent blood sample obtained from said individual before said administering; or (b) the level of systemic presence or activity of IFNy-producing leukocytes, or the rate of proliferation of leukocytes in response to stimulation, characteristic of a population of individuals afflicted with a disease, disorder, condition or injury of the CNS. The embodiments above that describe different features of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention are relevant also for the method of the invention, because the method employs the same pharmaceutical composition. In yet an additional aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for use in treating a disease, disorder, condition or injury of the CNS that does not include the autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease RRMS, said pharmaceutical composition comprising an active agent that causes reduction of the level of systemic immunosuppression in an individual selected from: (i) an antibody specific for: (a) CD47; (b) OX40; (c) VEGF-A (bevacizumab); (d) CD25; (e) GITR (GITR triggering mAb (DTA-1)); (f) CCR4; or (g) TIM-3/Galectin9; (h) an anti-killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor; (i) an anti-LAG-3; or (j) an anti-4-lBB; (ii) any combination of (a) to (j); (iii) any combination of (a) to (j) in combination with an adjuvant such as a TLR9 ligand such as CpG; (iv) a protein selected from: (a) Neem leaf glycoprotein (NLGP); or (b) sCTLA-4; (v) a small molecule selected from: (a) Sunitinib; (b) Polyoxometalate- 1 (POM- l);(c) α,β-methyleneadenosine 5' -diphosphate (APCP); (d) arsenic trioxide (AS2O3); (e) GX15- 070 (Obatoclax); (f) a retinoic acid antagonist such as Ro 41-5253 or LE-135; (g) an SIRPa (CD47) antagonist, such as CVl-hIgG4 as sole agent or in combination with anti-CD47 antibody; (h) a CCR4 antagonist, such as AF399/420/ 18025 as sole agent or in combination with anti-CCR4 antibody; or (i) an adenosin A2B receptor antagonist, such as PSB603; (j) an antagonist of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase; (k) an HIF-1 regulator; (vi) a silencing molecule such as miR-126 antisense and anti-galectin-1 (Gal-1); (vii) OK-432; (viii) a combination of IL- 12 and anti-CTLA-4; (ix) an antibiotic agent such as vancomycin; or (x) any combination of (i) to (ix). Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers or excipients. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The following exemplification of carriers, modes of administration, dosage forms, etc., are listed as known possibilities from which the carriers, modes of administration, dosage forms, etc., may be selected for use with the present invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand, however, that any given formulation and mode of administration selected should first be tested to determine that it achieves the desired results. Methods of administration include, but are not limited to, parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, mucosal (e.g., oral, intranasal, buccal, vaginal, rectal, intraocular), intrathecal, topical and intradermal routes. Administration can be systemic or local. The term "carrier" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the active agent is administered. The carriers in the pharmaceutical composition may comprise a binder, such as microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone (polyvidone or povidone), gum tragacanth, gelatin, starch, lactose or lactose monohydrate; a disintegrating agent, such as alginic acid, maize starch and the like; a lubricant or surfactant, such as magnesium stearate, or sodium lauryl sulphate; and a glidant, such as colloidal silicon dioxide. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical preparation may be in liquid form, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or may be presented as a drug product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters, or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinized maize starch, polyvinyl pyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). The tablets may be coated by methods well-known in the art. Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound. For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. The compositions may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multidose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen free water, before use. The compositions may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. For administration by inhalation, the compositions for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, e.g., gelatin, for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The determination of the doses of the active ingredient to be used for human use is based on commonly used practices in the art, and will be finally determined by physicians in clinical trials. An expected approximate equivalent dose for administration to a human can be calculated based on the in vivo experimental evidence disclosed herein below, using known formulas (e.g. Reagan-Show et al. (2007) Dose translation from animal to human studies revisited. The FASEB Journal 22:659-661). According to this paradigm, the adult human equivalent dose (mg/kg body weight) equals a dose given to a mouse (mg/kg body weight) multiplied with 0.081. The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting examples. EXAMPLES Materials and Methods Animals. 5XFAD transgenic mice (Tg6799) that co-overexpress familial AD mutant forms of human APP (the Swedish mutation, K670N/M671L; the Florida mutation, 1716V; and the London mutation, V717I) and PS 1 (M146L/L286V) transgenes under transcriptional control of the neuron- specific mouse Thy-1 promoter (Oakley et al, 2006), and AD double transgenic B6.Cg-Tg (APPswe, PSENldE9) 85Dbo/J mice (Borchelt et al, 1997) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Genotyping was performed by PCR analysis of tail DNA, as previously described (Oakley et al, 2006). Heterozygous mutant cx3crlGFPI+ mice (Jung et al, 2000) (B6.129P-cx?criim;Lto/J, in which one of the CX3CR1 chemokine receptor alleles was replaced with a gene encoding GFP) were used as donors for BM chimeras. Foxp3.LuciDTR mice (Suffner et al, 2010) were bred with 5XFAD mice to enable conditional depletion of Foxp3+ Tregs. Animals were bred and maintained by the Animal Breeding Center of the Weizmann Institute of Science. All experiments detailed herein complied with the regulations formulated by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Weizmann Institute of Science. RNA purification, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. Total RNA of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) was extracted with TRI Reagent (Molecular Research Center) and purified from the lysates using an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA of the choroid plexus was extracted using an RNA MicroPrep Kit (Zymo Research). mRNA (1 μg) was converted into cDNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). The expression of specific mRNAs was assayed using fluorescence-based quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). RT-qPCR reactions were performed using Fast-SYBR PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Quantification reactions were performed in triplicate for each sample using the standard curve method. Peptidylprolyl isomerase A (ppia) was chosen as a reference (housekeeping) gene. The amplification cycles were 95°C for 5 s, 60°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 15 s. At the end of the assay, a melting curve was constructed to evaluate the specificity of the reaction. For ifn-γ and ppia gene analysis, the cDNA was pre-amplified in 14 PCR cycles with non-random PCR primers, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the subsequent real-time PCR analysis, according to the manufacturer's protocol (PreAmp Master Mix Kit; Applied Biosystems). mRNA expression was determined using TaqMan RT-qPCR, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). All RT-qPCR reactions were performed and analyzed using StepOne software V2.2.2 (Applied Biosystems). The following TaqMan Assays- on-Demand™ probes were used: Mm02342430_gl (ppia) and MmOl 168134_ml (ifn-γ). For all other genes examined, the following primers were used: ppia forward 5'-AGC ATACAGGTCCTGGC ATCTTGT-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 33) and reverse 5'- C AAAGACC AC ATGCTTGCC ATCC A-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 34); icaml forward 5 '- AGATC AC ATTC ACGGTGCTGGCT A-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 35) and reverse 5'- AGCTTTGGGATGGT AGCTGGAAGA-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 36); vcaml forward 5'-TGTGAAGGGATTAACGAGGCTGGA-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 37) and reverse 5'- CCATGTTTCGGGCACATTTCCACA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 38); cxcllO forward 5'-AACTGCATCCATATCGATGAC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 39) and reverse 5'- GTGGCAATGATCTCAACAC-3' (SEQ ID NO: 40); ccl2 forward 5'-CATCCACGTGTTGGCTCA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 41) and reverse 5'- GATC ATCTTGCTGGTGAATGAGT-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 42); tnf-y forward 5'-GCCTCTTCTCATTCCTGCTT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 43) reverse CTCCTCCACTTGGTGGTTTG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 44); il-ΐβ forward 5'-CCAAAAGATGAAGGGCTGCTT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 45) and reverse 5'- TGCTGCTGCGAGATTTGAAG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 46); il-12p4 forward 5'-GAAGTTCAACATCAAGAGCA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 47) and reverse 5'- CATAGTCCCTTTGGTCCAG-3' (SEQ ID NO: 48); il-10 forward 5 '-TGAATTCCCTGGGTGAGAAGCTGA-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 49) and reverse 5'- TGGCCTTGTAGACACCTTGGTCTT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 50); tgffi2 forward 5'-AATTGCTGCCTTCGCCCTCTTTAC-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 51) and reverse 5'- TGTAC AGGCTGAGG ACTTTGGTGT-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 52); igf-1 forward 5'-CCGGACCAGAGACCCTTTG (SEQ ID NO: 53) and reverse 5'- CCTGTGGGCTTGTTGAAGTAAAA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 54); bdnf forward 5'-GATGCTCAGCAGTCAAGTGCCTTT-3' (SEQ ID NO: 55) and reverse 5'- GACATGTTTGCGGCATCCAGGTAA-3' (SEQ ID NO: 56); Immunohistochemistry. Tissue processing and immunohistochemistry were performed on paraffin embedded sectioned mouse (6 μιη thick) and human (10 μιη thick) brains. For human ICAM-1 staining, primary mouse anti-ICAM (1:20 Abeam; ab2213) antibody was used. Slides were incubated for 10 min with 3% H202, and a secondary biotin-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was used, followed by biotin/avidin amplification with Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Subsequently, 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB substrate) (Zytomed kit) was applied; slides were dehydrated and mounted with xylene-based mounting solution. For tissue stainings, mice were transcardially perfused with PBS prior to tissue excision and fixation. CP tissues were isolated under a dissecting microscope (Stemi DV4; Zeiss) from the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles of the brain. For whole mount CP staining, tissues were fixated with 2.5% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 hour at 4°C, and subsequently transferred to PBS containing 0.05% sodium azide. Prior to staining, the dissected tissues were washed with PBS and blocked (20% horse serum, 0.3% Triton X-100, and PBS) for lh at room temperature. Whole mount staining with primary antibodies (in PBS containing 2% horse serum and 0.3% Triton X-100), or secondary antibodies, was performed for lh at room temperature. Each step was followed by three washes in PBS. The tissues were applied to slides, mounted with Immu-mount (9990402, from Thermo Scientific), and sealed with cover-slips. For staining of sectioned brains, two different tissue preparation protocols (paraffin embedded or microtomed free-floating sections) were applied, as previously described (Baruch et al, 2013; Kunis et al, 2013). The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-Αβ (1:300, Covance, #SIG-39320); rabbit anti-GFP (1: 100, MBL, #598); rat anti-CD68 (1:300, eBioscience, #14-0681); rat anti-ICAM-1 (1:200, Abeam, #AB2213); goat anti-GFP (1: 100, Abeam, #ab6658); rabbit anti-IBA-1 (1:300, Wako, #019-19741); goat anti-IL-10 (1:20, R&D systems, #AF519); rat anti-Foxp3 (1:20, eBioscience, #13-5773-80); rabbit anti-CD3 (1:500, Dako, #IS503);; mouse anti-ZO-1, mouse anti-E- Cahedrin, and rabbit anti-Claudin- 1 (all 1: 100, Invitrogen, #33-9100, #33-4000, #51-9000); rabbit anti-GFAP (1:200, Dako, #Z0334). Secondary antibodies included: Cy2/Cy3/Cy5- conjugated donkey anti-mouse/goat/rabbit/rat antibodies (1:200; all from Jackson Immunoresearch). The slides were exposed to Hoechst nuclear staining (1:4000; Invitrogen Probes) for 1 min. Two negative controls were routinely used in immunostaining procedures, staining with isotype control antibody followed by secondary antibody, or staining with secondary antibody alone. For Foxp3 intracellular staining, antigen retrieval from paraffin- embedded slides was performed using Retreivagen Kit (#550524, #550527; BD Pharmingen™). Microscopic analysis, was performed using a fluorescence microscope (E800; Nikon) or laser- scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). The fluorescence microscope was equipped with a digital camera (DXM 1200F; Nikon), and with either a 20x NA 0.50 or 40x NA 0.75 objective lens (Plan Fluor; Nikon). The confocal microscope was equipped with LSM 510 laser scanning capacity (three lasers: Ar 488, HeNe 543, and HeNe 633). Recordings were made on postfixed tissues using acquisition software (NIS -Elements, F3 [Nikon] or LSM [Carl Zeiss, Inc.]). For quantification of staining intensity, total cell and background staining was measured using ImageJ software (NIH), and intensity of specific staining was calculated, as previously described (Burgess et al, 2010). Images were cropped, merged, and optimized using Photoshop CS6 13.0 (Adobe), and were arranged using Illustrator CS5 15.1 (Adobe). Paraffin embedded sections of human CP. Human brain sections of young and aged postmortem non-CNS-disease individuals, as well as AD patients, were obtained from the Oxford Brain Bank (formerly known as the Thomas Willis Oxford Brain Collection (TWOBC)) with appropriate consent and Ethics Committee approval (TW220). The experiments involving these sections were approved by the Weizmann Institute of Science Bioethics Committee. Flow cytometry, sample preparation and analysis. Mice were transcardially perfused with PBS, and tissues were treated as previously described (Baruch et al, 2013). Brains were dissected and the different brain regions were removed under a dissecting microscope (Stemi DV4; Zeiss) in PBS, and tissues were dissociated using the gentleMACS™ dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec). Choroid plexus tissues were isolated from the lateral, third and fourth ventricles of the brain, incubated at 37°C for 45 min in PBS (with Ca2+/Mg2+) containing 400 U/ml collagenase type IV (Worthington Biochemical Corporation), and then manually homogenized by pipetting. Spleens were mashed with the plunger of a syringe and treated with ACK (ammonium chloride potassium) lysing buffer to remove erythrocytes. In all cases, samples were stained according to the manufacturers' protocols. All samples were filtered through a 70μιη nylon mesh, and blocked with anti-Fc CD16/32 (1: 100; BD Biosciences). For intracellular staining of IFN-γ, the cells were incubated with para-methoxy amphetamine (10 ng/ml; Sigma- Aldrich) and ionomycin (250 ng/ml; Sigma- Aldrich) for 6h, and Brefeldin-A (10 μg/ml; Sigma- Aldrich) was added for the last 4h. Intracellular labeling of cytokines was done with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm™ Plus fixation/permeabilization kit (cat. no. 555028). For Treg staining, an eBioscience FoxP3 staining buffer set (cat. no. 00-5523-00) was used. The following fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen, BioLegend, R&D Systems, or eBiosciences, and used according to the manufacturers' protocols: PE or Alexa Fluor 450-conjugated anti-CD4; PE-conjugated anti-CD25; PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated anti-CD45; FITC-conjugated anti-TCRP; APC-conjugated anti-IFN-γ; APC-conjugated anti-FoxP3; Brilliant-violet-conjugated anti-CD45. Cells were analyzed on an LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences) using FlowJo software. In each experiment, relevant negative control groups, positive controls, and single stained samples for each tissue were used to identify the populations of interest and to exclude other populations. Preparation of BM chimeras. BM chimeras were prepared as previously described (Shechter et al, 2009; Shechter et al, 2013). In brief, gender- matched recipient mice were subjected to lethal whole-body irradiation (950 rad) while shielding the head (Shechter et al, 2009). The mice were then injected intravenously with 5xl06 BM cells from CX3CR1GFP/+ donors. Mice were left for 8-10 weeks after BM transplantation to enable reconstitution of the hematopoietic lineage, prior to their use in experiments. The percentage of chimerism was determined by FACS analysis of blood samples according to percentages of GFP expressing cells out of circulating monocytes (CDl lb+). In this head-shielded model, an average of 60% chimerism was achieved, and CNS -infiltrating GFP+ myeloid cells were verified to be CD45hlgh/CDl lbhlgh, representing monocyte-derived macrophages and not microglia (Shechter et al, 2013). Morris Water Maze. Mice were given three trials per day, for 4 consecutive days, to learn to find a hidden platform located 1.5 cm below the water surface in a pool (1.1 m in diameter). The water temperature was kept between 21-22°C. Water was made opaque with milk powder. Within the testing room, only distal visual shape and object cues were available to the mice to aid in location of the submerged platform. The escape latency, i.e., the time required to find and climb onto the platform, was recorded for up to 60 s. Each mouse was allowed to remain on the platform for 15 s and was then removed from the maze to its home cage. If the mouse did not find the platform within 60 s, it was manually placed on the platform and returned to its home cage after 15 s. The inter-trial interval for each mouse was 10 min. On day 5, the platform was removed, and mice were given a single trial lasting 60s without available escape. On days 6 and 7, the platform was placed in the quadrant opposite the original training quadrant, and the mouse was retrained for three sessions each day. Data were recorded using the Etho Vision V7.1 automated tracking system (Noldus Information Technology). Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Bonferroni post-hoc test. All MWM testing was performed between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. during the lights-off phase. Radial Arm Water Maze. The radial-arm water maze (RAWM) was used to test spatial learning and memory, as was previously described in detail (Alamed et al, 2006). Briefly, six stainless steel inserts were placed in the tank, forming six swim arms radiating from an open central area. The escape platform was located at the end of one arm (the goal arm), 1.5 cm below the water surface, in a pool 1.1 m in diameter. The water temperature was kept between 21-22°C. Water was made opaque with milk powder. Within the testing room, only distal visual shape and object cues were available to the mice to aid in location of the submerged platform. The goal arm location remained constant for a given mouse. On day 1, mice were trained for 15 trials (spaced over 3 h), with trials alternating between a visible and hidden platform, and the last 4 trails with hidden platform only. On day 2, mice were trained for 15 trials with the hidden platform. Entry into an incorrect arm, or failure to select an arm within 15 sec, was scored as an error. Spatial learning and memory were measured by counting the number of arm entry errors or the escape latency of the mice on each trial. Training data were analyzed as the mean errors or escape latency, for training blocks of three consecutive trials. GA administration. Each mouse was subcutaneously (s.c.) injected with a total dose of 100μg of GA (batch no. P53640; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Petah Tiqva, Israel) dissolved in 200μ1 of PBS. Mice were either injected according to a weekly-GA regimen (Butovsky et al, 2006), or daily-GA administration (Fig. 8 and Fig. 16). Mice were euthanized either 1 week after the last GA injection, or 1 month after treatment, as indicated for each experiment. Conditional ablation of Treg. Diphtheria toxin (DTx; 8 ng/g body weight; Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) daily for 4 consecutive days to Foxp3.LuciDTR mice(Suffner et al, 2010). The efficiency of DTx was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis of immune cells in the blood and spleen, achieving almost complete (>99%) depletion of the GFP-expressing FoxP3+ CD4+ Treg cells (Fig. 4). P300 inhibition. Inhibition of p300 in mice was performed similarly to previously described (Liu et al, 2013). p300i (C646; Tocris Bioscience) was dissolved in DMSO and injected i.p. daily (8.9 mg kg-1 d_1, i.p.) for 1 week. Vehicle-treated mice were similarly injected with DMSO. ATRA treatment. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) administration to mice was performed similarly to previously described (Walsh et al, 2014). ATRA (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO and injected i.p. (8 mg kg-1 d_1) every other day over the course of 1 week. Vehicle-treated mice were similarly injected with DMSO. Soluble Αβ (sAP) protein isolation and quantification. Tissue homogenization and sAp protein extraction was performed as previously described (Schmidt et al, 2005). Briefly, cerebral brain parenchyma was dissected and snap-frozen and kept at -80°C until homogenization. Proteins were sequentially extracted from samples to obtain separate fractions containing proteins of differing solubility. Samples were homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold tissue homogenization buffer, containing 250mM of sucrose, 20mM of Tris base, ImM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and ImM of ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (pH 7.4), using a ground glass pestle in a Dounce homogenizer. After six strokes, the homogenate was mixed 1: 1 with 0.4% diethylamine (DEA) in a 100-mM NaCl solution before an additional six strokes, and then centrifuged at 135,000g at 4°C for 45 min. The supernatant (DEA-soluble fraction containing extracellular and cytosolic proteins) was collected and neutralized with 10% of 0.5Mof Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). Αβι_4ο and Αβι_42 were individually measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) from the soluble fraction using commercially available kits (Biolegend; #SIG-38954 and #SIG-38956, respectively) according to the manufacturer instructions. Αβ plaque quantitation. From each brain, 6 μιη coronal slices were collected, and eight sections per mouse, from four different pre-determined depths throughout the region of interest (dentate gyrus or cerebral cortex) were immunostained. Histogram-based segmentation of positively stained pixels was performed using the Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Bethesda, MD, USA). The segmentation algorithm was manually applied to each image, in the dentate gyrus area or in the cortical layer V, and the percentage of the area occupied by total Αβ immunostaining was determined. Plaque numbers were quantified from the same 6 μιη coronal brain slices, and are presented as average number of plaques per brain region. Prior to quantification, slices were coded to mask the identity of the experimental groups, and plaque burden was quantified by an observer blinded to the identity of the groups. Statistical analysis. The specific tests used to analyze each set of experiments are indicated in the figure legends. Data were analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t test to compare between two groups, one-way ANOVA was used to compare several groups, followed by the Newman-Keuls post-hoc procedure for pairwise comparison of groups after the null hypothesis was rejected (P < 0.05). Data from behavioral tests were analyzed using two-way repeated- measures ANOVA, and Bonferroni post-hoc procedure was used for follow-up pairwise comparison. Sample sizes were chosen with adequate statistical power based on the literature and past experience, and mice were allocated to experimental groups according to age, gender, and genotype. Investigators were blinded to the identity of the groups during experiments and outcome assessment. All inclusion and exclusion criteria were pre-established according to the IACUC guidelines. Results are presented as means + s.e.m. In the graphs, y-axis error bars represent s.e.m. Statistical calculations were performed using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Introduction. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by neuronal damage, amyloid beta (Αβ) plaque formation, and chronic inflammation within the central nervous system (CNS), leading to gradual loss of cognitive function and brain tissue destruction (Akiyama et al, 2000; Hardy & Selkoe, 2002). Under these conditions, circulating myeloid cells, and the resident myeloid cells of the CNS, the microglia, play non-redundant roles in mitigating the neuroinflammatory response (Britschgi & Wyss- Coray, 2007; Cameron & Landreth, 2010; Lai & McLaurin, 2012). Specifically, whereas microglia fail to ultimately clear Αβ deposits, CNS -infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-ΜΦ) play a beneficial role in limiting Αβ plaque formation and fighting off AD-like pathology (Butovsky et al, 2007; Koronyo-Hamaoui et al, 2009; Mildner et al, 2011; Simard et al, 2006; Town et al, 2008). The brain's choroid plexus (CP), whose epithelial layers form the blood-CSF-barrier (BCSFB), has been identified as a selective gateway for leukocyte entry to the CNS, enabling recruitment of mo-ΜΦ and T cells following neural tissue damage (Kunis et al, 2013; Shechter et al, 2013). Here, we hypothesized that in AD, suboptimal recruitment of inflammation-resolving immune cells to the diseased parenchyma is an outcome of systemic immune failure, involving CP gateway dysfunction. Example 1. Choroid plexus (CP) gateway activity along disease progression in the mouse model of AD. We first examined CP activity along disease progression in the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of AD (AD-Tg); these mice co-express five mutations associated with familial AD and develop cerebral Αβ pathology and gliosis as early as 2 months of age (Oakley et al, 2006). We found that along the progressive stages of disease pathology, the CP of AD-Tg mice, compared to age- matched wild-type (WT) controls, expressed significantly lower levels of leukocyte homing and trafficking determinants, including icaml, vcaml, cxcllO, and ccl2 (Fig. 1A), shown to be upregulated by the CP in response to acute CNS damage, and needed for transepithelial migration of leukocytes (Kunis et al, 2013; Shechter et al, 2013). Immunohistochemical staining for the integrin ligand, ICAM-1, confirmed its reduced expression by the CP epithelium of AD- Tg mice (Fig. lb). In addition, staining for ICAM-1 in human postmortem brains, showed its age-associated reduction in the CP epithelium, in line with our previous observations (Baruch et al, 2014), and quantitative assessment of this effect revealed further decline in AD patients compared to aged individuals without CNS disease (Fig. 2A). Since the induction of leukocyte trafficking determinants by the CP is dependent on epithelial interferon (IFN)-y signaling (Kunis et al, 2013), we next tested whether the observed effects could reflect loss of IFN-γ availability at the CP. Examining the CP of 5XFAD AD-Tg mice using flow cytometry intracellular staining, revealed significantly lower numbers of IFN-y-producing cells in this compartment (Fig. 2B), and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis confirmed lower mRNA expression levels of ifn-γ at the CP of AD-Tg mice compared to age-matched WT controls (Fig. 2C). Example 2. The functional relationships between Treg-mediated systemic immune suppression, CP gateway activity, and AD pathology. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a pivotal role in suppressing systemic effector immune responses (Sakaguchi et al, 2008). We envisioned that Treg-mediated systemic immune suppression affects IFN-γ availability at the CP, and therefore focused on the involvement of Tregs in AD pathology. In line with previous reports of elevated Treg levels and suppressive activities in AD patients (Rosenkranz et al, 2007; Saresella et al, 2010; Torres et al, 2013), evaluating Foxp3+ Treg frequencies in splenocytes of 5XFAD AD-Tg mice, relative to their age-matched WT littermates, revealed their elevated levels along disease progression (Fig. 3A, B). To study the functional relationships between Treg-mediated systemic immune suppression, CP gateway activity, and AD pathology, we crossbred 5XFAD AD-Tg mice with Foxp3 -diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR+) mice, enabling transient conditional in vivo depletion of Foxp3+ Tregs in AD- Tg/DTR+ mice by administration of diphtheria toxin (DTx) (Fig. 4A). Transient depletion of Tregs resulted in elevated mRNA expression of leukocyte trafficking molecules by the CP of AD-Tg/DTR+ mice relative to DTx-treated AD-Tg/DTR" littermates (Fig. 5A). Analysis of the long-term effect of the transient Treg depletion on the brain parenchyma (3 weeks later), revealed immune cell accumulation in the brain, including elevated numbers of CD45high/CDl lbhigh myeloid cells, representing infiltrating mo-ΜΦ (Shechter et al, 2013), and CD4+ T cells (Fig. 5B). In addition, the short and transient depletion of Tregs resulted in a marked enrichment of Foxp3+ Tregs among the CD4+ T cells that accumulated within the brain, as assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 5C, D). RT-qPCR analysis of the hippocampus showed increased expression oifoxp3 and MO mRNA (Fig. 5E). We next examined whether the short-term depletion of Tregs, which was followed by accumulation of immunoregulatory cells in sites of brain pathology, led to a long-term effect on brain function. We observed reduction in hippocampal gliosis (Fig. 5F), and reduced mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as il-12p40 and tnf-a (Fig. 5G). Moreover, cerebral Αβ plaque burden in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, and the cerebral cortex (5th layer), two brain regions exhibiting robust Αβ plaque pathology in 5XFAD AD-Tg mice(Oakley et al, 2006), was reduced (Fig. 6A, B). Evaluating the effect on cognitive function, using the Morris water maze (MWM) test, revealed a significant improvement in spatial learning and memory in AD-Tg/DTR+ mice following the Treg depletion, relative to DTx-treated AD- Tg/DTR" aged matched mice, reaching performance similar to that of WT mice (Fig. 6C-E). Taken together, these data demonstrated that transiently breaking Treg-mediated systemic immune suppression in AD-Tg mice resulted in accumulation of inflammation-resolving cells, including mo-ΜΦ and Tregs, in the brain, and was followed by resolution of the neuroinflammatory response, clearance of Αβ, and reversal of cognitive decline. Example 3. Weekly administration of Copolymer-1 reduces Treg-mediated systemic immune suppression, improves CP gateway activity, and mitigates AD pathology. To further substantiate the causal nature of the inverse relationship between systemic immune suppression, CP function and AD pathology, we next made use of the immunomodulatory compound, Glatiramer acetate (GA; also known as Copolymer-1, or Copaxone®), which in a weekly administration regimen was found to have a therapeutic effect in the APP/PS 1 mouse model of AD (Butovsky et al, 2006); this effect was functionally associated with mo-ΜΦ recruitment to cerebral sites of disease pathology (Butovsky et al, 2007). Here, we first examined whether the CP in APP/PS 1 AD-Tg mice, similarly to our observation in 5XFAD AD-Tg mice, is also deficient with respect to IFN-γ expression levels. We found that in APP/PS 1 AD-Tg mice, IFN-γ levels at the CP were reduced relative to age-matched WT controls (Fig. 7A). These results encouraged us to test whether the therapeutic effect of weekly-GA in APP/PS 1 mice (Butovsky et al, 2006), could be reproduced in 5XFAD AD-Tg mice, and if so, whether it would affect systemic Tregs, and activation of the CP for mo-ΜΦ trafficking. We therefore treated 5XFAD AD-Tg mice with a weekly administration regimen of GA over a period of 4 weeks (henceforth, "weekly-GA"; schematically depicted in Fig. 8A). We found that 5XFAD AD-Tg mice treated with weekly-GA, showed reduced neuroinflammation (Fig. 8B-D), and improved cognitive performance, which lasted up to 2 months after the treatment (Fig. 8E-I). Examining by flow cytometry the effect of weekly-GA on systemic immunity and on the CP, we found reduced splenocyte Foxp3+ Treg levels (Fig. 9A), and an increase in IFN-y-producing cells at the CP of the treated 5XFAD AD-Tg mice, reaching similar levels as those observed in WT controls (Fig. 9B). The elevated level of IFN-y-expressing cells at the CP in the weekly-GA treated mice, was accompanied by upregulated epithelial expression of leukocyte trafficking molecules (Fig. 9C). To detect infiltrating mo-ΜΦ entry to the CNS, we used 5XFAD AD-Tg/CX3CR1GFP/+ bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice (prepared using head protection), allowing the visualization of circulating (green fluorescent protein (GFP)+ labeled) myeloid cells (Shechter et al, 2009; Shechter et al, 2013). We found increased homing of GFP+ mo-ΜΦ to the CP and to the adjacent ventricular spaces following weekly-GA treatment, as compared to vehicle-treated AD- Tg/CX3CR1GFP/+ controls (Fig. 9D-E). Immunohistochemistry of the brain parenchyma revealed the presence of GFP+ mo-ΜΦ accumulation at sites of cerebral plaque formation (Fig. 9F), and quantification of infiltrating myeloid cells, by flow cytometry analysis of the hippocampus in AD-Tg non-chimeric mice, showed increased numbers of CDl lbhlghCD45hlgh-expressing cells (Fig. 9G, H). Together, these results substantiated the functional linkage between mo-ΜΦ recruitment to sites of AD pathology, reduction of systemic Treg levels and IFN-y-dependent activation of the CP. Example 4. A short-term direct interference with Treg activity, improves CP gateway activity, and mitigates AD pathology. 4.1 Interference with Treg activity using a small molecule histone acetyltrans erase inhibitor. The findings above, which suggested that Treg-mediated systemic immune suppression interferes with the ability to fight AD pathology, are reminiscent of the function attributed to Tregs in cancer immunotherapy, in which these cells hinder the ability of the immune system to mount an effective anti-tumor response (Bos & Rudensky, 2012; Nishikawa & Sakaguchi, 2010). Therefore, we considered that a treatment that directly interferes with Foxp3+ Treg cell activity might be advantageous in AD. We tested p300i (C646 (Bowers et al, 2010)), a nonpeptidic inhibitor of p300, a histone acetyltransferase that regulates Treg function (Liu et al, 2013); this inhibitor was shown to affect Treg suppressive activities while leaving protective T effector cell responses intact (Liu et al, 2013). We found that mice treated with p300i, compared to vehicle (DMSO) treated controls, showed elevated levels of systemic IFN-γ- expressing cells in the spleen (Fig. 10A), as well as in the CP (Fig. 10B). We next treated AD- Tg mice with either p300i or vehicle over the course of 1 week, and examined them 3 weeks later for cerebral Αβ plaque burden. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant reduction in cerebral Αβ plaque load in the p300i treated AD-Tg mice (Fig. 10C-E). We also tested whether the effect on plaque pathology following one course of treatment would last beyond the 3 weeks, and if so, whether additional courses of treatment would contribute to a long-lasting effect. We therefore compared AD-Tg mice that received a single course of p300i treatment and were examined 2 month later, to an age-matched group that received two courses of treatments during this period, with a 1 -month interval in between (schematically depicted in Fig. 10F). We found that the reduction of cerebral plaque load was evident even two months after a single course of treatment, but was stronger in mice that received two courses of treatments with a 1-month interval in between (Fig. 10G). Since impaired synaptic plasticity and memory in AD is associated with elevated cerebral levels of soluble Αβι_4ο/Αβι_42 (sAP) levels (Shankar et al, 2008), we also measured sAp levels following a single or repeated cycles of p300i treatment. Again, we found that both one and two courses (with an interval of 1 month in between) were effective in reducing cerebral sAp, yet this effect was stronger following repeated courses with respect to the effect on (Fig. 10H). These results indicated that while a single short-term course of treatment is effective, repeated courses of treatments would be advantageous to maintain a long-lasting therapeutic effect, similar to our observations following weekly-GA treatment. 4.2 Interference with Treg activity using an anti-PDl antibody. At 10 months of age, 5XFAD Alzheimer's' disease (AD) transgenic (Tg) mice were injected i.p. with either 250ug of anti-PDl (RMP1-14; #BE0146; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) or control IgG (IgG2a; #BE0089; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) antibodies, on day 1 and day 4 of the experiment, and were examined 3 weeks after (schematically depicted in Fig. 11A) for their cognitive performance by radial arm water maze (RAWM) spatial learning and memory task, as was previously described in detail (Alamed et al, 2006). Briefly, on day 1 of the RAWM task, mice were trained for 15 trials (spaced over 3 h), with trials alternating between a visible and hidden platform, and the last 4 trails with hidden platform only. On day 2, mice were trained for 15 trials with the hidden platform. Entry into an incorrect arm, or failure to select an arm within 15 sec, was scored as an error. Spatial learning and memory were measured by counting the number of arm entry errors or the escape latency of the mice on each trial. Age matched untreated WT and AD-Tg mice were used as controls. We found that 5XFAD AD-Tg mice treated with one treatment session, n which included two injections of anti-PDl (on day 1 and day 4), showed, as assessed 3 weeks after, significant improved spatial cognitive performance in the RAWM (Fig. 11B). We next examined whether the effect on disease pathology was associated with reduction of systemic immune suppression. We repeated the experiment described above, this time examining the mice at the end of treatment session (day 7 of the experiment; schematically depicted in Fig. 12A). We observed that in this time point, attenuation of systemic immune suppression in PD-l-treated AD-Tg mice, was accompanied by a systemic effect of elevation of IFN-Y-producing CD4 splenocytes (Fig. 12B), which correlated to a local effect at the CP of elevation of IFN-γ mRNA levels (Fig. 13A), and elevation in expression of CP leukocyte trafficking molecules, the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL10 (Fig. 13B). These data showed that the short session of anti-PD-1 treatment in AD-Tg mice was associated with a systemic response of attenuating Treg-mediated immune suppression, as expected (Naidoo et al, 2014), and activation of the CP gateway activity for leukocyte trafficking to the CNS. Finally, we examined the effect on disease pathology in AD-Tg mice, and whether an additional session of treatment was advantageous in its effect on pathology. To this end, 10 months old AD-Tg mice, either received 1 session of anti-PD-1 treatment, as described above, or an additional treatment with an interval of 3 weeks. Control groups were either treated with IgG or untreated, and all groups of mice were tested for their cognitive performance 3 weeks later (schematically depicted in Fig. 14A). We found that while AD-Tg mice treated with 1 session of anti-PD-1 ("AD-Tg + PD-1 XI") and examined 2 months later, displayed significant cognitive improvement in comparison to IgG-treated and untreated AD-Tg mice, the effect was less robust than when the same mice were assessed for the cognitive performance a month earlier. In contrast, AD-Tg mice which received a second session of anti-PD-1 treatment ("AD-Tg + PD-1 X2") showed significantly better spatial learning and memory abilities in the RAWM compared to AD-Tg which received 1 session, as well as compared to IgG-treated or untreated AD-Tg mice (Fig. 14B). These findings revealed that in order to maintain a long lasting therapeutic effect, repeated sessions of are needed. 4.3 Interference with Treg activity using a combination of anti-PDl antibody and anti- CTLA4 antibody. At 10 months of age, 5XFAD Alzheimer's' disease (AD) transgenic (Tg) mice are injected i.p. with either 250μg of anti-PDl (RMP1-14; #BE0146; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) and 250μg anti-CTLA4 (InVivoMAb anti-mCD152; #BE0131; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) or control IgG (IgG2a, #BE0089 or Polyclonal Syrian Hamster IgG, #BE0087; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) antibodies, on day 1 and day 4 of the experiment, and are examined 3 weeks after for their cognitive performance by radial arm water maze (RAWM) spatial learning and memory task, as described above. Some mice receive an additional treatment session with an interval session of 3 weeks. Control groups are either treated with IgG or untreated, and all groups of mice are tested for their cognitive performance 3 weeks later. It is expected that the mice treated with the combination of antibodies display significant cognitive improvement in comparison to IgG-treated and untreated AD-Tg mice as well as a significant reduction of cerebral plaque load. Example 5. Augmentation of Treg activity has an adverse effect on AD pathology. To substantiate the negative role of Treg-mediated systemic immune suppression in AD, we next investigated whether augmenting systemic Treg levels could have an opposite, adverse effect on AD pathology. To test this, we potentiated Treg- suppressive function in AD-Tg mice by administration of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which induces Treg differentiation (Mucida et al, 2007), stabilizes Treg phenotype (Zhou et al, 2010), and renders Tregs more suppressive (Zhou et al, 2010). We used 5XFAD AD-Tg mice at relatively early stages of disease progression, and treated them with either ATRA or vehicle (DMSO). ATRA-treated AD-Tg mice showed significantly higher splenocyte frequencies of Foxp3+CD25+ Tregs (Fig. 15A, B). Examining the mice 3 weeks after the last ATRA injection, revealed a higher cerebral Αβ plaque burden and gliosis (approximately 2-3 fold increase; Fig. 15C-E), and assessment of sAp revealed increased cerebral sAPi_4o and levels following augmentation of systemic Tregs (Fig. 15F-G). Assessment of cognitive performance, using the RAWM, showed worsening of the spatial memory deficits in ATRA-treated AD-Tg mice, relative to vehicle-treated AD-Tg mice (Fig. 15H). Given our present findings of the negative effect of systemic Tregs on AD pathology, together with the fact that daily administration of GA is known to induce Tregs and is used in the clinic for treating multiple sclerosis (MS) (Haas et al, 2009; Hong et al, 2005; Weber et al, 2007), we tested whether GA in daily regimen (over a period of 1 month), in contrast to weekly- GA, might have a negative effect on disease pathology in AD-Tg mice. We compared the effect of daily- vs. weekly-GA administration (schematically depicted in Fig. 16A), in 5XFAD AD-Tg mice. Assessment of cognitive performance by the RAWM task revealed that, in contrast to the beneficial effect of weekly-GA treatment, either no beneficial effect on spatial memory, or a tendency towards a worsening effect, was observed in AD-Tg mice that received daily-GA (Fig. 16B). Additionally, unlike the robust effect of the weekly-GA administration on plaque clearance, daily-GA treated AD-Tg mice did not show any beneficial effect, or showed a moderate adverse effect on plaque load (Fig. 16C-F). These findings emphasize how MS and AD, two CNS pathologies associated with neuroinflammation, could be oppositely and distinctively affected by the same immunomodulatory treatment with daily-GA (Schwartz & Baruch, 2014a). Example 6. Direct interference with Treg activity improves CP gateway activity and prevents or mitigate PTSD pathology. Severely stressful conditions or chronic stress can lead to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. We previously suggested that CP gateway activity may be critical for coping with mental stress, and in the case of suboptimal function of the CP, mental traumatic episode may lead to PTSD (Schwartz & Baruch, 2012). We further hypothesized that timely systemic intervention after the trauma, which will help modifying the CP response, may prevent development of chronic conditions of PTSD. Our findings that a short term attenuation of Treg- mediated systemic immune suppression has a long term effect on brain pathology, suggest that this intervention, immediately following the traumatic event, would prevent PTSD development. To test our working hypothesis that the CP is involved in coping with traumatic stress and that it might dysfunction in cases where traumatic stress leads to the development of PTSD, we adopted a physiological PTSD-like animal model in which the mice exhibit hypervigilant behaviour, impaired attention, increased risk assessment, and poor sleep (Lebow et al, 2012). In this experimental model of PTSD induction, mice are habituated for 10 days to a reverse day/night cycle, inflicted with two episodes of electrical shocks (the trauma and the trigger), referred to as a "PTSD induction", and evaluated at different time points subsequent to trauma. Following the traumatic event mice are injected with said compound which transiently reduces peripheral immune suppression. The mice are treated according to one or more of the following regimens: • Mice are injected i.p. with either 250μg of anti-PDl (RMP1-14; #BE0146; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) or control IgG (IgG2a; #BE0089; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) antibodies, on day 1 and day 4 following the traumatic event, and examined after an additional interval session of two weeks; • Mice are injected i.p. with either 250μg of anti-PDl (RMP1-14; #BE0146; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) and 250μg anti-CTLA4 (InVivoMAb anti-mCD152; #BE0131; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) or control IgG (IgG2a, #BE0089 or Polyclonal Syrian Hamster IgG, #BE0087; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) antibodies, on day 1 and day 4 of the experiment, and examined after an interval session of two weeks; • Mice are injected i.p. with weekly-GA as described above following the traumatic event, and examined after an interval session of two weeks; • Mice are treated with p300i or vehicle over the course of 1 week following the traumatic event, and examined 3 weeks later as described above. Some mice receive an additional treatment session with an appropriate interval session. It is expected that mice that receive the treatment do not display anxiety behavior associated with PTSD in this experimental model, as assessed by time spent exploring and risk assessing in dark/light maze or the other behavioral tasks described in (Lebow et al, 2012). Example 7. Transient reduction of systemic immune suppression mitigates Parkinson's Disease pathology. Parkinson disease (PD) transgenic (Tg) mice are used in these experiment. The mice are treated at the progressive stages of disease according to one or more of the following regimens: • Mice are injected i.p. with either 250μξ of anti-PDl (RMP1-14; #BE0146; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) or control IgG (IgG2a; #BE0089; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) antibodies, on day 1 and day 4 following the traumatic event, and examined after an additional interval session of two weeks; • Mice are injected i.p. with either 250μξ of anti-PDl (RMP1-14; #BE0146; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) and 25(Vg anti-CTLA4 (InVivoMAb anti-mCD152; #BE0131; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) or control IgG (IgG2a, #BE0089 or Polyclonal Syrian Hamster IgG, #BE0087; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) antibodies, on day 1 and day 4 of the experiment, and examined after an interval session of two weeks; • Mice are injected i.p. with weekly-GA as described above following the traumatic event, and examined after an interval session of two weeks; • Mice are treated with p300i or vehicle over the course of 1 week following the traumatic event, and examined 3 weeks later as described above. Some mice receive an additional treatment session with an appropriate interval session (about 3 weeks to one month). Motor neurological functions are evaluated using for example the rotarod performance test, which assesses the capacity of the mice to stay on a rotating rod. It is expected that PD-Tg mice treated with one treatment session show significant improved motor performance, compared to IgG-treated or vehicle treated control group, or untreated group. PD-Tg mice which receive two courses of therapy, and examined after an appropriate interval session are expected to show a long-lasting therapeutic effect. To maintain this therapeutic effect mice are subjected to an active session of treatment with an appropriate interval session between each session. Example 8. Transient reduction of systemic immune suppression mitigates Huntington's Disease pathology. The model used in these experiments may be the Huntington's disease (HD) R6/2 transgenic mice (Tg) test system. R6/2 transgenic mice over express the mutated human huntingtin gene that includes the insertion of multiple CAG repeats mice at the progressive stages of disease. These mice show progressive behavioral-motor deficits starting as early as 5-6 weeks of age, and leading to premature death at 10-13 weeks. The symptoms include low body weight, clasping, tremor and convulsions. The mice are treated according to one or more of the following regimens when they are 45 days old: • Mice are injected i.p. with either 250μg of anti-PDl (RMP1-14; #BE0146; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) or control IgG (IgG2a; #BE0089; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) antibodies, on day 1 and day 4 following the traumatic event, and examined after an additional interval session of two weeks; • Mice are injected i.p. with either 250μg of anti-PDl (RMP1-14; #BE0146; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) and 250μg anti-CTLA4 (InVivoMAb anti-mCD152; #BE0131; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) or control IgG (IgG2a, #BE0089 or Polyclonal Syrian Hamster IgG, #BE0087; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) antibodies, on day 1 and day 4 of the experiment, and examined after an interval session of two weeks. • Mice are injected i.p. with weekly-GA as described above following the traumatic event, and examined after an interval session of two weeks; • Mice are treated with p300i or vehicle over the course of 1 week following the traumatic event, and examined 3 weeks later as described above. Some mice receive an additional treatment session with an appropriate interval session (about 3 weeks to one month). Motor neurological functions are evaluated using for example the rotarod performance test, which assesses the capacity of the mice to stay on a rotating rod. It is expected that HD-Tg mice treated with one treatment session show significant improved motor performance, compared to IgG-treated or vehicle treated control group, or untreated group. HD-Tg mice which receive which receive two courses of therapy, and examined after an appropriate interval session are expected to show a long-lasting therapeutic effect. To maintain this therapeutic effect mice are subjected to an active session of treatment with an appropriate interval session between each session. Example 9. Transient reduction of systemic immune suppression mitigates amyotrophic lateral sclerosis pathology. The model used in this experiment may be the transgenic mice overexpressing the defective human mutant SOD1 allele containing the Gly93- Ala (G93A) gene (B6SJL-TgN (SODl-G93A)lGur (herein "ALS mice"). This model develop motor neuron disease and thus constitute an accepted animal model for testing ALS. The mice are treated according to one or more of the following regimens when they are 75 days old: • Mice are injected i.p. with either 25(Vg of anti-PDl (RMP1-14; #BE0146; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) or control IgG (IgG2a; #BE0089; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) antibodies, on day 1 and day 4 following the traumatic event, and examined after an additional interval session of two weeks; • Mice are injected i.p. with either 25(^g of anti-PDl (RMP1-14; #BE0146; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) and 25(Vg anti-CTLA4 (InVivoMAb anti-mCD152; #BE0131; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) or control IgG (IgG2a, #BE0089 or Polyclonal Syrian Hamster IgG, #BE0087; Bioxcell Lifesciences Pvt. LTD.) antibodies, on day 1 and day 4 of the experiment, and examined after an interval session of two weeks. • Mice are injected i.p. with weekly-GA as described above following the traumatic event, and examined after an interval session of two weeks; • Mice are treated with p300i or vehicle over the course of 1 week following the traumatic event, and examined 3 weeks later as described above. Some mice receive an additional treatment session with an appropriate interval session (about 3 weeks to month). Motor neurological functions are evaluated using for example the rotarod performance test, which assesses the capacity of the mice to stay on a rotating rod, or mice are allowed to grasp and hold onto a vertical wire (2 mm in diameter) with a small loop at the lower end. A vertical wire allows mice to use both fore- and hindlimbs to grab onto the wire. The wire is maintained in a vertically oriented circular motion (the circle radius was 10 cm) at 24 rpm. The time that the mouse is able to hang onto the wire is recorded with a timer. It is expected that ALS mice treated with one treatment session show significant improved motor performance, compared to IgG-treated or vehicle treated control group, or untreated group. ALS mice which receive which receive two courses of therapy, and examined after an appropriate interval session are expected to show a long-lasting therapeutic effect. To maintain this therapeutic effect mice are subjected to an active session of treatment with an appropriate interval session between each session.
