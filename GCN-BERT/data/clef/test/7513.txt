To receive the signal, the signal-receiving device comprises a first signal-receiving head 21 provided on the obverse side of the glass-wiping device body and a second signal-receiving head 22 provided on the reverse side of the glass-wiping device body, the first signal-receiving head 21 is configured to receive the control signal transmitted from the obverse side of the glass-wiping device body 1, and the second signal-receiving head 22 is configured to receive the control signal transmitted from the reverse side of the glass-wiping device 1. Since the first signal-receiving head 21 and the second signal-receiving head 22 are respectively provided on the obverse and reverse sides of the glass-wiping device body 1 in this embodiment, in a process when the glass-wiping device body 1 is operating on the surface of the glass 100, a remote signal transmitted by the remote control regardless of being in whichever direction of the obverse and reverse sides of the glass-wiping device body 1 can be received by the first signal-receiving head 21 and/or the second signal-receiving head 22 provided on the obverse/reverse side, so that various actions of the glass-wiping device body 1 can be accurately controlled. Second Embodiment FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of structure of the present invention according to a second embodiment. As shown in FIG. 2, in this embodiment, in order that the structure of the glass-wiping device body can be further simplified and that the glass-wiping device body 1 can advantageously receive an infrared signal upon operating on both the inside and the outside of the glass 100, the signal-receiving device in the glass-wiping device body 1 comprises a third signal-receiving head 30 provided in the glass-wiping device body 1. A space 200 is formed between the obverse and reverse sides of the third signal-receiving head 30 and a shell of the glass-wiping device body 1, and the space 200 is hollow or is filled with transparent material (not shown). To guide the light, a first light-guiding pole 201 and a second light-guiding pole 202 are provided in the space 200, one end of the first light-guiding pole 201 and the second light-guiding pole 202 is connected with the third signal-receiving head 30, and another end thereof is respectively extended to the obverse and reverse sides of the shell of the glass-wiping device body 1.
