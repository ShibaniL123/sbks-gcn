Although the drawings represent embodiments of the present disclosure, the drawings are not necessarily to scale and certain features may be exaggerated in order to better illustrate and explain the present disclosure. The exemplifications set out herein illustrate an exemplary embodiment of the disclosure, in one form, and such exemplifications are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the disclosure in any manner. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The embodiments disclosed herein are not intended to be exhaustive or limit the disclosure to the precise form disclosed in the following detailed description. Rather, the embodiments are chosen and described so that others skilled in the art may utilize their teachings. In one exemplary embodiment, a barrier between a contaminated hand and a curtain material is provided. Since the hand or curtain may be contaminated by bacteria, virus, or other infectious source, transmission from patient to patient can occur by re-touching the curtain between patients and causing cross-contamination between successive patients. Since the device is a protective barrier film between the curtain and the hand, and is meant to be changed between patients, it will reduce contamination between successive patients. Thus, the barrier device is applied before the patient enters the room and is removed after the patient leaves the room. This same application and device removal is repeated for each patient. In some embodiments, any curtain type can be easily covered by the barrier since the device barrier has an adhesive sticky coating on one side that will affix the device to the curtain. The adhesive is light enough that the barrier can be pulled away from the curtain between patients to change the barrier, but strong enough to affix the barrier to the curtain for the intended hospital/room stay or other desired time period. In some exemplary embodiments, a “Y” shaped roller device is used to apply the film to the curtain. At the center of the “Y” is a hinge which allows the “Y” to close and touch both sides of the curtain. The “Y” shaped roller device is positioned around an end edge of the curtain and allows the film to be applied simultaneously to each side. Thus, each arm of the “Y” has a roll of barrier film connected as one strip of film by the two rolls. The “Y” shaped roller device is then closed around in the edge of the curtain and unrolled as it is dragged along the curtain edge. While the film is unrolled tightly against the curtain, it becomes adhered to the curtain. The area of curtain protected consisting of the height and length of the film is near the edge of the curtain, which is in the area maximally used by individuals using and moving the curtain; same with the depth of the film into the curtain. In some exemplary embodiments, the barrier film is impregnated with one or more antimicrobial substances/molecules/atoms. Thus, in addition to a physical barrier a chemical barrier is achieved. Referring first to FIG. 1, an exemplary applicator 10 for applying the barrier 12 (see FIG. 2) is provided. Applicator 10 includes a handle 14 allowing a user to hold and manipulate the applicator 10. As illustrated, applicator 10 further includes first roll 16 and second roll 18 of barrier 12 for application onto a curtain, such as curtain 20 (see FIG. 2). In one exemplary embodiment, first roll 16 and second roll 18 are separate rolls of barrier 12. In another exemplary embodiment (not shown), first roll 16 and second roll 18 are connected as one strip of barrier 12. Each roll 16, 18 of barrier 12 includes one or more barriers 12 for application to a curtain 20. In one exemplary embodiment, each barrier 12 has a first adhesive side 22 and a second outward-facing side 24 (see FIG. 6). When provided as roll 16, 18, adhesive side 22 of barrier 12 is provided on an outside surface of roll 16, 18, to allow adhesive side 22 to attach barrier 12 to curtain 20. As illustrated in FIG. 1, applicator 10 may include Y-arms 26, 28 onto which rolls 16, 18 are provided. Rolls 16, 18 may include a passageway therethrough allowing rolls 16, 18 to rotate about Y-arms 26, 28. Y-arms 26, 28 are coupled by hinge 30. Hinge 30 allows Y-arms 26, 28 to open and close the applicator 10. In an open configuration, rolls 16, 18 are spaced apart and can be loaded or unloaded from applicator 10. In a closed configuration, rolls 16, 18 contact opposing sides of curtain 20 to apply the barrier 12 to curtain 20. In some configurations, hinge 30 includes a spring or other biasing element. Additionally, hinge 30 is actuated to move Y-arms 26, 28 (and therefore rolls 16, 18) toward one another by an actuator (not shown). As one of skill in the art will readily understand, actuator may be coupled mechanically to hinge 30 and/or arms 26, 28 in a number of different configurations, and be activated by a user through a button, lever, trigger or other mechanism. FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary curtain 20 to which barrier 12 is applied. Barrier 12 may be applied to one or more sides of curtain 20. In the illustrated embodiment, barrier 12 is applied to opposing front and back sides of curtain 20 (see FIGS. 4 and 5). In the illustrated embodiment, barrier 12 is applied to an edge 32 of curtain 20. In some embodiments, barrier 12 is applied along edge 32. In other embodiments, barrier 12 is applied spaced apart from edge 32. In still other embodiments, the barrier 12 is applied such that a portion of the film applied from roll 16 contacts a portion of the film applied from roll 18 thereby forming a seal along edge 32. In the illustrated embodiment, the barrier 12 covers only a central portion of edge 32 which is most likely to be grasped by personnel moving curtain 20. In other embodiments, the barrier 12 may extend along the entire length of edge 32 to a top edge 34, bottom edge 36, or both. In some embodiments, the barrier film is applied to multiple edges, such as to both edges 32 and 38. As illustrated in FIG. 2, curtain 20 is illustratively hung from curtain rod 40 by a plurality of curtain hooks 42. FIG. 3 illustrates a user contacting the barrier 12 on curtain 20. As illustrated, the user's fingers 44 and palm 46 contact a first barrier 12 on curtain 20, while the user's thumb 48 contacts a similar second barrier film (not shown) on the opposing side of curtain 20. In this way, the user is able to contact the curtain to move the curtain along curtain rod 40 (see FIG. 2), while touching only barrier 12 and not the surface of curtain 20. In some exemplary embodiments, barrier 12 provides protection against contamination on a user's hand and/or a curtain material. One or both of the user's hand or curtain 20 may be contaminated by bacteria. Re-touching curtain 20 or touching multiple curtains 20 between patients may cause cross-contamination and increased potential for nosocomial infections resulting in secondary and/or tertiary superinfections. In some embodiments, barrier 12 provides a disposable surface that is periodically changed, such as between patients, after a high acuity event, or after a specific time period. This periodic change enables a reduction or elimination of such cross-contaminations. In some exemplary embodiments, barrier 12 is impregnated, coated, or otherwise contains an antimicrobial substance. As used herein, antimicrobial refers to any substance that reduces, eliminates, or prevents one or more of bacteria, viruses, fungi, mycobacteria, or combinations thereof that can cause infection. Exemplary antimicrobial substances any film, molecule, chemical atom, nanotechnology, or other substance currently manufactured or in development that reduces, eliminates, or prevents microbes. In some non-limiting, exemplary embodiments, antimicrobial substance includes one or more of copper or silver. In some non-limiting, exemplary embodiments, the barrier 12 is an embedded-type film, including films with embedded metal nanoparticles, ions, molecules, chemicals, or other antimicrobial substances or a coated-type film, including films coated with metal nanoparticles, ions, molecules, chemicals, or other antimicrobial substances. FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate an exemplary method of applying barrier 12 to opposing sides of curtain 20 using the exemplary applicator 10 illustrated in FIG. 1. Applicator 10 is positioned such that first roll 16 and second roll 18 are on opposing sides of curtain 20, then moved to the closed configuration. The adhesive side of each barrier 12 on first roll 16 and second roll 18 contacts curtain 20. Applicator 10 is moved in direction 50, allowing first roll 16 and second roll 18 to rotate about Y-arms 26, 28. As first roll 16 and second roll 18 rotate, the barrier 12 unwinds from applicator 10 and is applied to curtain 20. When the desired length of barrier 12 is applied to curtain 20, applicator 10 is them moved to the open configuration. In one embodiment, first roll 16 and second roll 18 each contain a single barrier film. In another exemplary embodiment, first roll 16 and second roll 18 contain multiple lengths of barrier 12 that can be separated along a perforation or other separation during application on curtain 20. In still another exemplary embodiment, first roll 16 and second roll 18 contain a continuous barrier 12 that is pre-formed to provide the desired length of barrier 12 for curtain 20. In such an embodiment, the entire contents of rolls 16, 18 are applied to curtain 20 in each application. In yet still another exemplary embodiment, applicator 10 includes a cutting mechanism (not shown) to allow a user to apply a desired length of barrier 12 for curtain 20. Exemplary cutting mechanisms include, cutting blades, cutting teeth, scissors, and other suitable cutting mechanisms.
