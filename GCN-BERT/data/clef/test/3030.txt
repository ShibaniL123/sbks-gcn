(2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-4-{[6-methyl-4-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl]amino}-1-{[(propan-2-yl)oxy]carbonyl}-5-[2-(propan-2-yl)phenyl]pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid
Example 82A
(2S,3R,4S,5S)-2-tert-butyl 1-isopropyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(2-isopropylphenyl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylate
(2S,3R,4S,5S)-tert-Butyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(2-isopropylphenyl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (Core 9, 1.5 g, 3.84 mmol) was dissolved in toluene (4.52 mL) and triethylamine (1.338 mL, 9.60 mmol) was added, followed by slow addition of isopropyl carbonochloridate (2.305 mL, 4.61 mmol) solution after cooling in an ice-water bath to ˜10° C. The addition was at such a rate that the temperature was maintained at or below room temperature during the addition (2-3 min). When the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was removed from the water bath, stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, diluted with diethyl ether and stirred with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate for 20 minutes before separating the layers. The organic layer was washed three times with 1 M aqueous HCl and brine then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. The crude material was triturated with 20 mL hot heptanes, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated. The residue was loaded onto a 24 g cartridge, eluting with a gradient of 0-50% ethyl acetate/heptanes over a period of 20 minutes to provide desired product (2S,3R,4S,5S)-2-tert-butyl 1-isopropyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(2-isopropylphenyl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylate (1.55 g, 3.25 mmol, 85% yield).
