CA 02530213 2005-12-15 SPECIFICATION APPARATUS AND METHOD OF TOASTING BREAD-TYPE FOOD PRODUCTS Field of the Invention This invention generally relates to the art of toasting apparatus and, particularly, to a dual function heating and toasting apparatus for radiantly heating or surface toasting bread-type food products, along with a method of surface toasting products such as buns or the like. Background of the Invention Toasting apparatus are used in a wide variety of applications ranging from simple two-slice toasters used in the home to more elaborate toasting apparatus used in restaurants, such as fast food restaurants, for prepañng vañous bread-type food products. Some toasters have fiat heated platens for engaging and "caramelizing;' the fiat surface of certain products such as sandwich buns. In other words, the innerflat surfaces of the two bun halves are pressed against the fiat heated platens to give the desired toasted finish on the surfaces of the bun or other such bread product. Other toasters use radiant heat and are used for toasting such bread products as bagels, muffins or the like. In these types of toasters, the bread product is not actually touched or pressed against a fiat heated surface or platen. In many restaurant establishments, such as fast food restaurants, radiant toasters are used during "breakfast time" for toasting such products as bagels, muffins, croissants or the like with radiant heat. After the breakfast time, the radiant toaster is moved out of the way and a second "lunch or dinner time" toaster is brought out for toasting the fiat surfaces of other bread products such as sandwich buns, slices of bread or the like. Problems with such systems CA 02530213 2005-12-15 involve the fact that two separate toasters are required to perform two separate toasting functions or processes. This requires multiple expenditures, multiple shelf space, multiple cleaning jobs and other related problems. The present invention is directed to solving these problems by providing a new and improved dual function toaster, along with a novel platen and gate system, as well as a unique method of surface toasting buns or other such bread-type food products. Summary of the Invention An object, therefore, of the invention is to provide a new and improved toasting apparatus of the character described, along with a novel surface toasting method. In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, a dual function heating and toasting apparatus is provided for radiantly heating or surface toasting bread-type food products. The apparatus includes a housing defining a heating/toasting chamber. A generally vertically oriented, center fixed heating platen is disposed in the chamber. A pair of generally vertically oriented, outside fixed heating platens are spaced outwardly from opposite sides of the center fixed platen. A pair of generally vertically oriented, movable heating platens are disposed on opposite sides of the center fixed platen inside the pair of outside fixed platens. Gate means are movably mounted on the housing near the bottoms of the platens for movement between a closed position to hold a product between the platens and an open position allowing a finished product to drop out of the chamber. With the above structural combination, a product such as a bagel can be placed into the chamber onto the gate means between one of the movable platens and one of the fixed platens and spaced therefrom to heat the bagel by radiant heat. Or, a product such as a bun can be placed into the chamber onto the gate means between one of the movable platens and one of the fixed platens, with the movable platen biasing the bun against the fixed CA 02530213 2005-12-15 platen to surface toast the bun. The gate means is movable to the open position to allow the heated bagel or the toasted bun to drop out of the chamber. As disclosed herein, the movable platens are movable between heating positions spaced away from the outside fixed platens for radiantly heating a pair of products therebetween. The movable platens are movable to toasting positions toward the center fixed platens for surface toasting a pair of products on opposite sides thereof. The fixed heating platens are heated platens. The movable heating platens are fabñcated of heat conductive mateñal for absorbing and radiating heat from the heated fixed platens. According to one aspect of the invention, the gate means are pivotally mounted on the housing for pivotal movement between a raised, closed position and a lowered, open position. At least one solenoid is mounted on the housing and is mechanically coupled to the gate means to pivot the gate means between the raised and lowered positions. At least one cam is pivotally mounted on the housing and includes a cam profile engageable with the gate means. The solenoid is operatively associated with the cam for pivoting the cam. According to another aspect of the invention, the movable platens are hoñzontally slidably mounted on the housing. At least one motor is mechanically coupled to the movable platens to move the platens between the heating and toasting positions. The motor includes a rotating member eccentrically connected by link arms to the slidably mounted movable platens. According to a further aspect of the invention, the housing includes an auxiliary toasting chamber for surface toasting both sides of a product such as a club section of a bun. A generally vertically oriented, fixed heated platen is disposed centrally of the auxiliary toasting chamber. A generally vertically oriented, movable heated platen biases the club section against the fixed platen for surface toasting both sides of the club section. In the preferred embodiment, the fixed heated platèn in the auxiliary toasting chamber comprises an extension of the center fixed platen in the main heating/toasting chamber. The invention CA 02530213 2012-11-14 64267-1405 contemplates a pair of the movable heated platens at opposite sides of the fixed heated platen in the auxiliary toasting chamber for toasting both sides of a pair of club sections. In an alternative embodiment of the dual function toaster, a single fixed heated platen is provided with a pair of movable heating platens disposed on opposite sides thereof. The movable platens are mounted for movement toward and away from the fixed platen between a heating position away from the fixed platen and a toasting position near the fixed platen. Other features of the invention include the provision of a screen on the side of each movable platen which faces the fixed platen against which the product is surface toasted. The invention contemplates a method of surface toasting a food product by biasing the food product against the surface of a heated platen for a given amount of time. The movable platen then is backed off slightly to allow the product to expand while still surface toasting, whereafter the movable platen moves completely away from the fixed platen to allow the product to exit the chamber. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, there is provided a dual function heating and toasting apparatus for radiantly heating or surface toasting bread-type food products, comprising: a housing defining a heating/toasting chamber; a generally vertically oriented, center fixed heating platen disposed in the chamber; a pair of generally vertically oriented, outside fixed heating platens spaced outwardly from opposite sides of the center fixed platen; a pair of generally vertically oriented, movable heating platens disposed on opposite sides of the center fixed platen inside the pair of outside fixed platens; and gate means movably mounted on the housing near the bottoms of the platens for movement between a closed position to hold a product between the platens and an open position allowing a finished product to exit the chamber, whereby a product such as a bagel can be placed into the chamber onto the gate means between one of the movable platens and one of 64267-1405 CA 02530213 2012-11-14 - 4a - the fixed platens and spaced therefrom to heat the bagel by radiant heat, or a product such as a bun can be placed into the chamber onto the gate means between one of the movable platens and one of the fixed platens with the movable platen biasing the bun against the fixed platen to surface toast the bun, the gate means being movable to the open position to allow the heated bagel or the toasted bun to exit the chamber.

In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided a dual function heating and toasting apparatus for heating or toasting bread-type food products, comprising: a housing defining a heating/toasting chamber; a generally vertically oriented, fixed heating platen disposed in the chamber, the fixed platen being a heated platen; a pair of generally vertically oriented movable heating platens disposed on opposite sides of the fixed platen and being fabricated of heat conductive material for absorbing and radiating heat from the heated fixed platen; and gate means movably mounted on the housing near the bottoms of the platens for movement between a closed position to hold a product between the platens and an open position allowing a finished product to exit the chamber, whereby a product CA 02530213 2012-11-14 64267-1405 - 4b - such as a bagel can be placed into the chamber onto the gate means between one of the movable platens and the fixed platen and spaced therefrom to heat the bagel by radiant heat, or a product such as a bun can be placed into the chamber onto the gate means between one of the movable platens and the fixed platen with the movable platen biasing the bun against the fixed platen to surface toast the bun, the gate means being movable to the open position to allow the heated bagel or the toasted bun to exit the chamber. In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of surface toasting a bread-type food product, comprising the steps of: providing a toasting apparatus having a fixed heated platen and a movable platen; depositing a product between the platens while in spaced condition; moving the movable platen toward the fixed platen to bias the product against the fixed platen and surface toast the product; backing the movable platen away from the fixed platen an amount sufficient for the product to expand but not completely release the product from the fixed platen; and moving the movable platen completely away from the fixed platen to completely release the product from the fixed platen. Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments Referring to the drawings in greater detail, and first to Figures 1-3, the invention is embodied in a dual function heating and toasting apparatus, generally designated 32, for radiantly heating or surface toasting bread-type food products. Before proceeding with a detailed description of the apparatus, a general commentary on the overall function of the apparatus is in order. Specifically, what happens in most restaurant establishments, such as fast food restaurants, is that a radiant toaster is used during "breakfast time" in the morning for toasting such products as bagels, muffins or the like with radiant heat. After the breakfast time, the radiant toaster is moved away, and a second sandwich toaster is brought out for "lunch or dinner time" for toasting the fiat surfaces of other bread products such as hamburger buns or slices of bread to "caramelize" the fiat surfaces of the products. The two toasters require considerable space even when not in use. The single toaster disclosed and claimed herein performs both functions of either radiantly heating or surface toasting bread-type food products. With those understandings, and referring back to Figures 1-3, apparatus 32 includes a housing 34 which may be fabricated of formed sheet metal material. The housing includes a pair of vented, removable side walls 34a to gain access to various components of the apparatus. One of the side walls is shown removed in Figure 3. A pair of elongated, generally parallel, larger openings 36 are formed in a top wall 34b of the housing. A pair of smaller openings 37 are formed in the top wall at one end of the larger openings. A pair CA 02530213 2005-12-15 of heating/toasting chambers, generally designated 38, are provided within the housing immediately beneath the openings. Bread-type food products are deposited through the openings into chambers 38 in the direction of arrows "A". After the products are either radiantly heated or surface toasted, the products drop into a service tray 40 in the direction of arrow "B". Before proceeding with a further detailed descñption of apparatus 32, certain terms must be defined for use herein. In the industry and in much of the prior art, the terms "toaster", "toasting" and the like have been used in a wide variety of applications to describe practically any apparatus or practically any process which acts upon a bread-type food product. If a product such as a bun or a slice of bread is surface toasted, the apparatus is called a "toaster". If a product such as a bagel or croissant is radiantly heated, the apparatus still is called a "toaster". Following that common usage would be confusing herein since a single apparatus is performing either function. Such usage also would be confusing herein because various movable heating platens are used for both radiantly heating a product as well as surface toasting a product. Therefore, the term "heating" platen will be used herein to described a platen whether or not it is directly heated or not. in addition, the functions on the bread-type food products will be described as either being "radiantly heated" or "surface toasted" in order to avoid confusion. With the understandings immediately above, reference now is made to Figure 4 wherein one of the heating/toasting chambers 38 of housing 34 beneath one of the larger openings 36 will be described. A generally vertically oriented, center fixed heating platen 40 is appropriately mounted within the housing and is centrally disposed within the chamber. A pair of generally vertically oriented, outside fixed heating platens 42 are appropriately mounted within the housing and are spaced outwardly from opposite sides of center fixed platen within chamber 38. A pair of generally vertically oriented, movable heating platens 44 are appropriately movably mounted within the housing in chamber 38 CA 02530213 2005-12-15 on opposite sides of center fixed platen 40 inside the pair of outside fixed platens 42. Platens 44 are movable inthe direction of double-headed arrows "C" toward and away from center fixed platen 40 as well as toward and away from outside fixed platens 42. Ail of the platens are elongated, generally planar components of a finite thickness. The center and outside fixed platens 40 and 42, respectively, are heated platens. In other words, the platens have heating elements embedded therein. Movable platens 44 are passive heating platens. In other words, the movable platens are fabricated of a heat conductive material for absorbing and radiating heat from the heated fixed platens. Still referring to Figure 4, a pair of elongated gates 46 close the bottom of chamber 38 between center fixed platen 40 and outside fixed platens 42. The gates are pivotally mounted for reciprocal movement in the direction of double-headed arrows "D" about a common pivot shaft 48. The gates are raised and lowered by a pair of lift rods 50, as will be seen hereinafter. Figures 3, 5 and 6 show a system for conjointly moving movable platens 44 in each chamber 38 either in a direction toward center fixed platen and away from outside fixed platens 42 or in a direction toward the outside fixed platens and away from the center fixed platen. More particularly, the movable platens are connected by brackets 52 to two pairs of long actuator arms 54 (Fig. 5). The brackets slide within slots 56 in an' interior wall 34c of housing 34. Actuator arms 54 are pivotally mounted to the interior wall at 54a. A pair of stepping motors 58 are mounted to the outside of interior wall 34c. Each motor has a rotating member 58a which is fixed to an eccentric arm 58b which rotates or pivots with the rotating member. A motor 58 is provided for each pair of actuating arms 54 and, therefore, each pair of movable platens 44 in each heating/toasting chamber 38. A short link arm 60a and a long link arm 60b are pivotally connected at adjacent ends to eccentric arm 58b. The short link arm is pivotally connected to the left-hand actuator arm 54 in the respective pair CA 02530213 2005-12-15 thereof as seen in Figures 3, 5 and 6. The long link arm 60b is pivotally connected to the right-hand actuator arm 54 in each pair of thereof. With this linkage system, and referring specifically to the enlarged depiction of Figure 6, when motor 58 is stepped to cause rotating member 58a to rotate in the direction of arrow "E", eccentric arm 58b will rotate or pivot in the direction of arrow "F". This will cause short link arm 60a to move generally linearly in the direction of arrow "G", while long link arm 60b moves generally linearly in the opposite direction of arrow "H". When the link arms move in opposite direction as indicated, actuator arms 54 are caused to pivot toward each other about pivots 54a (Fig. 5). This causes movable platens 44 to move toward each other toward opposite sides of center fixed platen 40 as seen in Figure 4. If motor 58 is stepped in the opposite direction to cause rotating member 58a to rotate opposite the direction of arrow "E", eccentric arm 58b rotates opposite arrow "F" and link arms 60a and 60b move opposite arrows "G" and "H", respectively, to cause movable platens 44 to move away from center fixed platen 40 and toward outside fixed platens 42. Figures 3 and 5 show a means for lifting (closing) and dropping (opening) gates 46 (Fig. 4). Specifically, four solenoids 62 are mounted to the outside of interior wall 34c of the housing. Each solenoid includes an operating rod 62a which reciprocates in the direction of arrow 'T'. The following will be described for one pair of solenoids which are effective to lift and/or drop a single one of the gates 46 on one side of center fixed platen 40 as seen in Figure 4. With that understanding, looking at the left-hand pair of solenoids 62 in Figure 5, operating rod 62a of the left solenoid is pivotally connected, at 64, to a cam plate 66 which is pivotally mounted, as at 68, to interior wall 34c of the housing. The operating rod 62a of the right-hand solenoid is pivotally connected to the cam plate at 70. The toP edge of the cam plate is divided into a top, generally horizontal cam edge 68a and an arcuate dropping cam edge 68b. It can be seen that the left-hand lift rod 50 (also see Fig. 4) for the left gate 46 CA 02530213 2005-12-15 J of the left chamber 38 rides along the cam profile at the top of cam plate 66. It can be seen in Figure 5 that lift rod 50 is resting on the top of generally horizontal cam edge 68a. In this position, the lift rod maintains the respective gate 46 in its lifted or closed position shown in Figure 4. In order to drop the respective gate 46, solenoids 62 are stepped so that the operating rod 62 of the left-hand solenoid moves upwardly in the direction of arrow "J", and the operating rod of the right solenoid moves downwardly in the direction of arrow "K". This causes cam plate 66 to pivot about pivot 68 in the direction of arrow "L". As the cam plate pivots, the weight of gate 46 causes lift rod 50 to drop into the arcuate cam edge 68b of the cam plate, whereupon the gate drops to open chamber 38 and allow the bread-type food product (which has been either radiantly heated or surface toasted) to drop into service tray 40. In order to lift the gate, the respective pair of solenoids are stepped in the opposite direction to rotate cam plate 68 opposite arrow "L" back to the position shown in Figure 5. As the cam plate rotates back, lift rod 50 rides back up arcuate cam edge 68b and onto top cam edge 68a, whereupon the gate is maintained in its raised or closed position. While Figure 5 and other figures show four solenoids mounted to interior wall 34c of the housing, these solenoids are effective to operate only one gate in each pair thereof for each chamber 68. For instance, in Figure 5, cam plates 66, with their respective solenoids, are operatively associated with the left-hand gates in the two chambers, as viewed in the direction of Figure There are four additional solenoids and two additional cam plates mounted to an interior wall at the opposite side of the housing to operate the other gate in each pair thereof. Since the operating structure is identical, the depictions and the above description have not been repeated herein in order to provide a more concise description of the invention. The sequence of operation of the dual function heating and toasting apparatus 32 of the invention now will be described in relation to Figures 7CA 02530213 2005-12-15 24. Although a wide range of controls ranging from pure mechanical controls to electronic controls are contemplated by the invention to actuate motors 58 and solenoids 62 in proper sequences, a programmed microprocessor is contemplated by the invention. The motors and solenoids are easily timed for any specific sequential operation or stepping by such a simple control as a microprocessor. Accordingly, Figures 7-15 show a sequence of operation for radiantly heating a bread-type food product such as a bagel, muffin, croissant or the like in a "breakfast" mode. First of ail, Figures 7-9 show a "breakfast open" condition of the apparatus similar to that depicted in Figures 4 and 5. In this condition, movable platens 44 have been moved toward center fixed platen to create spaces 74 between the movable platens and the outside fixed platens. The products to be radiantly heated are deposited into spaces 74 in the direction of arrows "M" on top of gates 46 which are being maintained in their lifted or closed positions by cam plates 66 and solenoids 62. Referring to Figures 10-12, after the products have been deposited into spaces 74, the microprocessor steps motors 58 to move the movable platens 44 outwardly in the direction of arrows "N" toward outside fixed platens 42 only a distance to "stand up" the product. The movable platens do not press the product against the outside fixed platens, because the product simply is to be radiantly heated. After a specific period of'time programmed into the microprocessor, movable platens 44 are moved back inwardly as shown in Figures 13-15 to again fully open spaces 74. At the same time, solenoids 62 are stepped to open or drop gates 46 to allow the radiantly heated products to drop into service tray At this point, and looking back at Figures 1 and 2, it should be remembered that larger openings 36 are elongated. Therefore, not only can two products be positioned into the heating/toasting chamber on directly opposite CA 02530213 2005-12-15 sides of center fixed platen 40 or movable platens 44, but multiple products can be deposited into the chamber longitudinally of openings 36. Figures 16-24 show the "sandwich" mode of apparatus 32 for surface toasting such bread-type food products as buns, slices of bread, rolls or the like. Specifically, Figures 16-18 show that movable platens 44 have been moved outwardly away from center fixed platen 40 completely toward the outside fixed platens 42. This creates spaces 76 immediately on opposite sides of the center fixed platen, between the center platen and the two movable platens which have been moved outwardly. This allows a bread-type product, such as a bun, to be easily deposited into spaces 76 in the direction of arrows "O". Of course, gates 46 are maintained in their lifted or closed positions so that the buns can be deposited directly on top of the gates. After the buns have been deposited into the heating/toasting chamber, movable platens 44 are moved inwardly in the direction of arrows "P" (Fig. 20) to bias a fiat surface of the buns against center fixed platen 40. With the center platen heated, the fiat surfaces of the buns are surface toasted or "caramelized". After the buns are surface toasted for a given programmed period of time, and referring to Figures 22-24, movable platens 44 are moved back outwardly to their completely open position to free the buns. Gates 46 are opened so that the completely processed buns can drop into service tray The invention contemplates a unique system which can be easily accomplished by the movable platens with simple microprocessor controls. Specifically, in the "sandwich" mode as described above in relation to Figures 16-24, after movable platens 44 have been moved inwardly in the direction of arrows "P" shown in Figure 20, the movable platens are maintained in a bunbiasing condition for a given period of time, whereafter the movable platens are backed-off away frorñ fixed heated platen 40 a small amount to allow the buns to expand during the toasting operation. After the complete toasting cycle has CA 02530213 2005-12-15 been achieved, the movable platens then will move to their fully open positions shown in Figures 22-24. In other words, the movable platens are moved outwardly from the positions of Figures 19-21 to the positions of Figures 22-24 in a two-step procedure to first press the fiat surfaces of the buns against the fiat surfaces of the heated center platen 40, and then to move the heated platens away from the center fixed platen a small amount sufficient to allow the buns to expand to a "fluffy" condition while still maintaining surface engagement with the center platen. Thereafter, the movable platens are fully opened to drop the completely processed buns. Figures 25 and 26 show a screen, generally designated 78, which includes a plurality, of wires 78a. The screens are mounted to the outside surfaces of movable platens 44 as seen in Figure 4. The screens prevent the bread-type food products from sticking to the movable platens. The screens have generally square openings 78b to accommodate "club" sections of apparatus 32 within smaller openings 36 (Fig. 1) of the apparatus as described immediately below. Specifically, when a sandwich, such as a hamburger, includes more than one meat patty, the bun may include a center slice of bread product to separate the patties. In the industry, this slice is commonly called a "club". Therefore, center fixed platen 40 is extended within housing 34 into smaller openings 36 where by the smaller openings (:lefine surface toasting chambers which include a center fixed, heated platen 40A as best seen in Figure 2. As stated, this center heated platen can simply be an extension of center fixed heated platen 40 described above. A pair of movable platens 44A can be connected for movement with movable platens 44. However, movable platens 44A preferably are heated platens so that the club of the bun is surface toasted on both sides thereof. With each opening 36 including a center fixed heated platen 40A and two movable heated platens 44A, four clubs of four buns can be accommodated by apparatus 32. Turning back to Figure 25, the enlarged CA 02530213 2005-12-15 openings 78b in screens 78 are sufficiently large to circumscribe the entire club sections without interfering with the components thereof so that surface toasting of opposite sides of the clubs can be accomplished. Figures 27-30 show a second embodiment of the invention wherein like reference numerals have been applied wherever possible to refer to like components described above in relation to the first embodiment of Figures 1-26. Specifically, a dual function heating and toasting apparatus 32 includes a housing 34 defining a pair of heating/toasting chambers 38 which lead to a service tray 40. A center, fixed heated platen 40 is mounted within each chamber. A pair of movable platens 44 are mounted similar to the first embodiment for movement toward and away from the fixed platen. Pivotally mounted gates 46 close and open the spaces on opposite sides of the fixed platen inside the movable platens. The gates can be operated by a similar solenoid, cam plate, lift rod system as described above in relation to the first embodiment. Rather than a link arm system as described above in relation to Figure 6 of the first embodiment, the second embodiment of Figures 27-30 include four motors 80 which rotate four cams 82 which are circular but eccentric in relation to rotating shafts 84 which are rotatably operated by motors Again, a microprocessor can be used to operate the motors in a predetermined sequence in conjunction with the operation of gates 46. In operating the second embodiment of Figures 27-30, the breadtype food products are deposited into chambers 38 in the direction of arrows "Q" (Fig. 29) with movable platens 44 spaced from fixed platens 40. The products are maintained in the spaces between the respective platens until they are radiantly heated to a given degree, whereupon gates 46 are opened to drop the products into service tray If it is desired to surface toast the products in the second embodiment of the invention, the products again are deposited in the direction of arrows "Q" in the spaces between the fixed center platen and the outside movable CA 02530213 2005-12-15 platens. The movable platens then are moved inwardly in the direction of arrows "R" to press the fiat surfaces of the products, such as the fiat surfaces of buns, against the center, heated platen. After a predetermined amount of time, the movable platens are moved back outwardly, opposite the direction of arrows "R", gates 46 are dropped and the processed products fall into service tray As with the first embodiment, movable platens 44 can be programmed to back-off from the fixed platen a small amount to allow buns, for instance, to expand while still maintaining the fiat surfaces of the buns in engagement with the center heated platen, whereafter the buns can be completely released and gates 46 dropped. While the center fixed platen 40 of the second embodiment is a heated platen, movable platens 44 again may be fabricated of heat conductive material for absorbing and radiating heat from the center, heated platen during the "breakfast" mode of the apparatus. It will be understood that the invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or central characteristics thereof.
