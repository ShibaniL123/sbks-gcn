Surgical Instruments [0062] This novel method of tagging surgical instruments and materials is applicable to a wide variety of surgical instruments. One skilled in the art recognizes that surgical instruments are subject to a variety of naming conventions, often resulting in one surgical instrument referred to by multiple names. Where a surgical instrument is given a particular name herein, one of skill in the art will recognize where that instrument is also known by other names. [0063] Surgical instruments are designed to perform either diagnostic or therapeutic operations to locate the cause of a problem, or to treat a problem once it has been found. Each of the tens of thousands of surgical instruments is designed to perform a specific function. Those functions are generally categorized under one of the following uses: to cut or incise; to retract; to grasp, hold or occlude; to dilate or probe; to cannulate or drain; to aspirate, inject, or infuse; to suture or ligate. [0064] A surgical instrument used according to the methods and included in the devices and systems herein may include a surgical needle. The surgical needle may be straight, 1/4 circle, 3/8 circle, 1/2 circle (subtypes of this needle shape include, from larger to smaller size, CT, CT- 1, CT-2 and CT-3), 5/8 circle, compound curve, half curved (also known as ski), and/or half curved at both ends of a straight segment (also known as canoe). The surgical needle may have a particular point geometry, such as a taper geometry (needle body is round and tapers smoothly to a point), a cutting geometry (needle body is triangular and has a sharpened cutting edge on the inside curve), a reverse cutting geometry (cutting edge on the outside), a trocar point or tapercut geometry (needle body is round and tapered, but ends in a small triangular cutting point), a blunt point for sewing friable tissues, a side cutting or spatula point (flat on top and bottom with a cutting edge along the front to one side) for eye surgery. The surgical needle may be an atraumatic needle that is permanently swaged to the suture or may be designed to come off the suture with a sharp straight tug. These "pop-offs" are commonly used for interrupted sutures, where each suture is only passed once and then tied. [0065] In some embodiments, the device, system or method comprises a surgical instrument used to cut or incise, which are frequently referred to as "sharps," and include scissors, knives, scalpels, chisels and osteotomes, among others.

EXAMPLES [0084] The present invention may be better understood through reference to the following non- limiting examples. These examples are included to describe exemplary embodiments only and should not be interpreted to encompass the entire breadth of the invention. Example 1 - Tagging a surgical needle [0085] Figure 1 illustrates a tagged needle. Figure 1A depicts an embodiment including a surgical instrument comprising a surgical needle 110, a surgical thread 120, and a tag 130 comprising an imaging sphere suspended in an adhesive polymer placed at the joint area of the surgical needle and surgical thread. Figure IB depicts a magnified view of the joint area of the surgical instrument embodiment of Figure 1 A. To prepare the tagged needle in Figure 1 A and IB, a tag is prepared as follows. A commercially available 2.0 micron polystyrene bead is used. The polystyrene bead is coated with a polyamine to facilitate a sol gel reaction. The bead is mixed with tetramethylorthosilicate for 2 hours, followed by addition of trimethoxyboron. The resulting particles are washed with water and ethanol to remove unreacted starting materials. The polystyrene bead core is subsequently removed via calcination at 550 °C for 18 hours. This yields a hollow porous silica gel particle with uniform wall thickness of approximately 10 nm. The hollow silica particles are then loaded with perfluoropentane by injecting PFP vapors using a gas syringe into a vessel containing the hollow silica particles. The injection of PFP vapors is performed 4 times. The resultant gas-filled silica spheres are sonicated to create a uniform suspension. The silica spheres are then mixed with cyanoacrylate to form an adhesive polymer with imaging properties. The resultant adhesive polymer is coated onto a thread filament in the joint area between the surgical needle and the surgical thread. Additionally or alternatively, the resultant adhesive polymer is used to adhere the thread filament to the surgical needle.
