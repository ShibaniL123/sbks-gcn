The sixth step
To a solution of Compound 19 (800mg, 2.55mmol) in ethanol (8.0 mL) were added silver nitrate (865 mg, 5.1 mmol) and iodine (1.3g, 5.1mmol), and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature. The insoluble materials were filtered through celite, and the filtrate was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution and aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution. The organic layer was washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield compound 20 (477 mg, yield 43%).
