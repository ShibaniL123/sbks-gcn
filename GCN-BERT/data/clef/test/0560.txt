FIELD Provided herein are bolaamphiphilic compounds, complexes thereof with specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and pharmaceutical compositions thereof. Also provided are methods of delivering siRNAs into the human and animal cell using the compounds, complexes and pharmaceutical compositions provided herein. Also provided are methods of delivering siRNAs into the human and animal organs, such as the brain, using the compounds, complexes and pharmaceutical compositions provided herein. BACKGROUND In the past decade, efforts to develop RNA-based therapeutic technologies have significantly intensified1-5. Triggering RNA interference (RNAi), in particular, has become one of the most widely used techniques for biomedical applications)1-11. RNAi employs a mechanism of post-transcriptional sequence specific gene silencing by processing double-stranded RNAs into small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) used as part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to selectively cleave target mRNAl2. After the discovery that synthetic siRNAs can be exogenously introduced into cells to activate RNAi13, 14, this approach has become a powerful method for selective suppression of specific genes of interest in different species, showing potential for use in cancer therapeutics3, 5, 6. However, the biomedical utility of the synthetic siRNAs is limited by several RNA structure-related factors such as the negative charge (uptake by cells that also have negatively charged surface) and instability in the blood circulation (non-modified siRNAs have a very short half-life in blood stream, mostly because of degradation by nucleases)4. These impediments can be overcome by using polymeric or lipid-based carriers to shield the negative charge and provide protection against nuclease activityl15-17. Complexation of the anionic carboxyfluorescein (CF) with single headed amphiphiles of opposite charge in cationic vesicles, formed by mixing single-tailed cationic and anionic surfactants has been reported (Danoff et al. 2007). Furthermore, WO 02/055011 and WO 03/047499, both of the same applicant, disclose amphiphilic derivatives composed of at least one fatty acid chain derived from natural vegetable oils such as vernonia oil, lesquerella oil and castor oil, in which functional groups such as epoxy, hydroxy and double bonds were modified into polar and ionic headgroups. Additionally, WO 10/128504 discloses a series of amphiphiles and bolamphiphiles (amphiphiles with two head groups) useful for targeted drug delivery of insulin, insulin analogs, TNF, GDNF, DNA, RNA (including siRNA), enkephalin class of analgesics, and others. These synthetic bolaamphiphiles (bolas) have recently been shown to form nanovesicles that interact with and encapsulate a variety of small and large molecules including peptides18, 19 proteins20 and plasmid DNAs19, 21 delivering them across biological membranes22. These bolaamphiphiles are a unique class of compounds that have two hydrophilic headgroups placed at each ends of a hydrophobic domain. Bolaamphiphiles can form vesicles that consist of monolayer membrane that surrounds an aqueous core. Vesicles made from natural bolaamphiphiles, such as those extracted from archaebacteria (archaesomes), are very stable and, therefore, might be employed for targeted drug delivery. However, bolaamphiphiles from archaebacteria are heterogeneous and cannot be easily extracted or chemically synthesized. Furthermore, bolas have a hydrophobic alkyl chain connected to positively charged head groups, that can potentially interact with negatively charged nucleic acids and promote their delivery into cells. However, the nature of these interactions as well as the possibility to use bolas for optimized delivery of therapeutic siRNAs remains a challenge. Thus, there remains a need to make new specific bolaamphiphiles which can be useful for optimized delivery of siRNAs into cells and have desired therapeutic utility. The compounds, compositions, and methods described herein are directed toward this end.

FIGURES FIG. 1: Double stranded siRNA and fluorescently labeled siRNA used for the in vitro and the in vivo experiments FIG. 2: Transfection of FITC-siRNA into dendritic cells and silencing of HSP60 gene in these cells by bolaamphiphilic vesicles with siRNA. Human primary dendritic cells (obtained by differentiating human monocytes by the cytokines IL-4 and GM-CSF) were exposed to GLH-19 vesicles with FITC-siRNA for 5 hours and cells were observed by a fluorescence microscope and examined by flow cytometry. The fluorescence micrographs show that all the cells became fluorescent after exposing them for 5 hours to bolaamphiphilic vesicles that contained FITC-siRNA whereas only few cells were fluorescent after transfecting them with the same concentration of FITC-siRNA by electroporation. These results were confirmed by flow cytometry studies shown in the lower part of the Figure. When the dendritic cells were exposed to GLH-19 vesicles with specific siRNA for HSP60, a very significant silencing of the gene was seen on a western blot compared to cells treated with empty vesicles (control cells). (V-smart vesicles-bolaamphiphilic vesicles). FIG. 3: Silencing of GFP gene in stably transfected macorophages by GFP siRNA. Macrophages cell line from a mouse that stably express eGFP were exposed to GLH-19 vesicles containg eGFP-siRNA. Not all the cells expressed the GFP as can be seen from comparison of the phase contrast micrograph to the fluorescence micrograph of untreated cells (lower right micrograph and upper right micrographs, respectively). Yet, the eGFP fluorescence in the cells that expressed the GFP gene disappeared almost completely when the cells were treated with GLH-19 vesicles containing eGFP-siRNA (lower left micrograph), whereas in cells that were treated with empty vesicles all the cells that expressed the eGFP remained fluorescent (upper left micrograph) (V-smart vesicles-bolaamphiphilic vesicles). FIG. 4: Silencing of eGFP in MDA-MB-231/GFP cell line treated with GLH-19 vesicles containing eGFP-siRNA. The breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 that stably express eGFP were exposed for 5 hours to GLH-19 vesicles containing egFP-siRNA. 72 hours after the exposure a very significant silencing of the eGFP gene was observed. No silencing was seen in cells exposed to empty vesicles (not shown). FIG. 5: Biodistribution of siRNA-AF555 in organs from mice after i.v. administration of bolavesicles containing siRNA-AF555. GLH-19 vesicles containing AF555-siRNA were injected via the tail vein into mice and 30 minutes later mice were acrificed, organs collected and imaging for AF-555 fluorescence was performed. Bakground fluorescence was adjusted to show brown color and AF-555 fluorescence was adjusted to give green color. AF-555 fluorescence is seen only in gall bladder (left image), blood vessels (around the lung, see middle image) and thoughout the brain (right image).

Wuts, 3rd edition, John Wiley & Sons, 1999, incorporated herein by reference. “Compounds of the present invention”, and equivalent expressions, are meant to embrace the compounds as hereinbefore described, in particular compounds according to any of the Formula herein recited and/or described, which expression includes the prodrugs, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and the solvates, e.g., hydrates, where the context so permits. Similarly, reference to intermediates, whether or not they themselves are claimed, is meant to embrace their salts, and solvates, where the context so permits. These and other exemplary substituents are described in more detail in the Detailed Description, Examples, and claims. The invention is not intended to be limited in any manner by the above exemplary listing of substituents. Other Definitions “Pharmaceutically acceptable” means approved or approvable by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or the corresponding agency in countries other than the United States, or that is listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia or other generally recognized pharmacopoeia for use in animals, and more particularly, in humans. “Pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a salt of a compound of the invention that is pharmaceutically acceptable and that possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the parent compound. In particular, such salts are non-toxic may be inorganic or organic acid addition salts and base addition salts. Specifically, such salts include: (1) acid addition salts, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, hexanoic acid, cyclopentanepropionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, 3-(4-hydroxybenzoyl) benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 1,2-ethane-disulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 4-toluenesulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, 4-methylbicyclo[2.2.2]-oct-2-ene-1-carboxylic acid, glucoheptonic acid, 3-phenylpropionic acid, trimethylacetic acid, tertiary butylacetic acid, lauryl sulfuric acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, hydroxynaphthoic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, muconic acid, and the like; or (2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, N-methylglucamine and the like. Salts further include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like; and when the compound contains a basic functionality, salts of non toxic organic or inorganic acids, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, tartrate, mesylate, acetate, maleate, oxalate and the like. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable cation” refers to an acceptable cationic counter-ion of an acidic functional group. Such cations are exemplified by sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium cations, and the like (see, e.g., Berge, et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 66(1): 1-79 (January '77). “Pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle” refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient or carrier with which a compound of the invention is administered. “Pharmaceutically acceptable metabolically cleavable group” refers to a group which is cleaved in vivo to yield the parent molecule of the structural Formula indicated herein. Examples of metabolically cleavable groups include —COR, —COOR,—CONRR and —CH2OR radicals, where R is selected independently at each occurrence from alkyl, trialkylsilyl, carbocyclic aryl or carbocyclic aryl substituted with one or more of alkyl, halogen, hydroxy or alkoxy. Specific examples of representative metabolically cleavable groups include acetyl, methoxycarbonyl, benzoyl, methoxymethyl and trimethylsilyl groups. “Prodrugs” refers to compounds, including derivatives of the compounds of the invention,which have cleavable groups and become by solvolysis or under physiological conditions the compounds of the invention that are pharmaceutically active in vivo. Such examples include, but are not limited to, choline ester derivatives and the like, N-alkylmorpholine esters and the like. Other derivatives of the compounds of this invention have activity in both their acid and acid derivative forms, but in the acid sensitive form often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility, or delayed release in the mammalian organism (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs, pp. 7-9, 21-24, Elsevier, Amsterdam 1985). Prodrugs include acid derivatives well know to practitioners of the art, such as, for example, esters prepared by reaction of the parent acid with a suitable alcohol, or amides prepared by reaction of the parent acid compound with a substituted or unsubstituted amine, or acid anhydrides, or mixed anhydrides. Simple aliphatic or aromatic esters, amides and anhydrides derived from acidic groups pendant on the compounds of this invention are particular prodrugs. In some cases it is desirable to prepare double ester type prodrugs such as (acyloxy)alkyl esters or ((alkoxycarbonyl)oxy)alkylesters. Particularly the C1 to C8 alkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, aryl, C7-C12 substituted aryl, and C7-C12 arylalkyl esters of the compounds of the invention. “Solvate” refers to forms of the compound that are associated with a solvent or water (also referred to as “hydrate”), usually by a solvolysis reaction. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. Conventional solvents include water, ethanol, acetic acid and the like. The compounds of the invention may be prepared e.g. in crystalline form and may be solvated or hydrated. Suitable solvates include pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, such as hydrates, and further include both stoichiometric solvates and non-stoichiometric solvates. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. “Solvate” encompasses both solution-phase and isolable solvates. Representative solvates include hydrates, ethanolates and methanolates. A “subject” to which administration is contemplated includes, but is not limited to, humans (i.e., a male or female of any age group, e.g., a pediatric subject (e.g, infant, child, adolescent) or adult subject (e.g., young adult, middleaged adult or senior adult)) and/or a non-human animal, e.g., a mammal such as primates (e.g., cynomolgus monkeys, rhesus monkeys), cattle, pigs, horses, sheep, goats, rodents, cats, and/or dogs. In certain embodiments, the subject is a human. In certain embodiments, the subject is a non-human animal. The terms “human”, “patient” and “subject” are used interchangeably herein. “Therapeutically effective amount” means the amount of a compound that, when administered to a subject for treating a disease, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease. The “therapeutically effective amount” can vary depending on the compound, the disease and its severity, and the age, weight, etc., of the subject to be treated. “Preventing” or “prevention” refers to a reduction in risk of acquiring or developing a disease or disorder (i.e., causing at least one of the clinical symptoms of the disease not to develop in a subject not yet exposed to a disease-causing agent, or predisposed to the disease in advance of disease onset. The term “prophylaxis” is related to “prevention”, and refers to a measure or procedure the purpose of which is to prevent, rather than to treat or cure a disease. Non-limiting examples of prophylactic measures may include the administration of vaccines; the administration of low molecular weight heparin to hospital patients at risk for thrombosis due, for example, to immobilization; and the administration of an anti-malarial agent such as chloroquine, in advance of a visit to a geographical region where malaria is endemic or the risk of contracting malaria is high. “Treating” or “treatment” of any disease or disorder refers, in certain embodiments, to ameliorating the disease or disorder (i.e., arresting the disease or reducing the manifestation, extent or severity of at least one of the clinical symptoms thereof). In another embodiment “treating” or “treatment” refers to ameliorating at least one physical parameter, which may not be discernible by the subject. In yet another embodiment, “treating” or “treatment” refers to modulating the disease or disorder, either physically, (e.g., stabilization of a discernible symptom), physiologically, (e.g., stabilization of a physical parameter), or both. In a further embodiment, “treating” or “treatment” relates to slowing the progression of the disease. As used herein, the term “isotopic variant” refers to a compound that contains unnatural proportions of isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compound. For example, an “isotopic variant” of a compound can contain one or more non-radioactive isotopes, such as for example, deuterium (2H or D), carbon-13 (13C), nitrogen-15 (15N), or the like. It will be understood that, in a compound where such isotopic substitution is made, the following atoms, where present, may vary, so that for example, any hydrogen may be 2H/D, any carbon may be 13C, or any nitrogen may be 15N, and that the presence and placement of such atoms may be determined within the skill of the art. Likewise, the invention may include the preparation of isotopic variants with radioisotopes, in the instance for example, where the resulting compounds may be used for drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Further, compounds may be prepared that are substituted with positron emitting isotopes, such as 11C, 18F, 15O and 13N, and would be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy. All isotopic variants of the compounds provided herein, radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the invention. It is also to be understood that compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “isomers”. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “stereoisomers”. Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed “diastereomers” and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed “enantiomers”. When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, when it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R-and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (−)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a “racemic mixture”. “Tautomers” refer to compounds that are interchangeable forms of a particular compound structure, and that vary in the displacement of hydrogen atoms and electrons. Thus, two structures may be in equilibrium through the movement of π electrons and an atom (usually H). For example, enols and ketones are tautomers because they are rapidly interconverted by treatment with either acid or base. Another example of tautomerism is the aci-and nitro-forms of phenylnitromethane, which are likewise formed by treatment with acid or base. Tautomeric forms may be relevant to the attainment of the optimal chemical reactivity and biological activity of a compound of interest. As used herein a pure enantiomeric compound is substantially free from other enantiomers or stereoisomers of the compound (i.e., in enantiomeric excess). In other words, an “S” form of the compound is substantially free from the “R” form of the compound and is, thus, in enantiomeric excess of the “R” form. The term “enantiomerically pure” or “pure enantiomer” denotes that the compound comprises more than 75% by weight, more than 80% by weight, more than 85% by weight, more than 90% by weight, more than 91% by weight, more than 92% by weight, more than 93% by weight, more than 94% by weight, more than 95% by weight, more than 96% by weight, more than 97% by weight, more than 98% by weight, more than 98.5% by weight, more than 99% by weight, more than 99.2% by weight, more than 99.5% by weight, more than 99.6% by weight, more than 99.7% by weight, more than 99.8% by weight or more than 99.9% by weight, of the enantiomer. In certain embodiments, the weights are based upon total weight of all enantiomers or stereoisomers of the compound. As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term “enantiomerically pure R-compound” refers to at least about 80% by weight R-compound and at most about 20% by weight S-compound, at least about 90% by weight R-compound and at most about 10% by weight S-compound, at least about 95% by weight R-compound and at most about 5% by weight S-compound, at least about 99% by weight R-compound and at most about 1% by weight S-compound, at least about 99.9% by weight R-compound or at most about 0.1% by weight S-compound. In certain embodiments, the weights are based upon total weight of compound. As used herein and unless otherwise indicated, the term “enantiomerically pure S-compound” or “S-compound” refers to at least about 80% by weight S-compound and at most about 20% by weight R-compound, at least about 90% by weight S-compound and at most about 10% by weight R-compound, at least about 95% by weight S-compound and at most about 5% by weight R-compound, at least about 99% by weight S-compound and at most about 1% by weight R-compound or at least about 99.9% by weight S-compound and at most about 0.1% by weight R-compound. In certain embodiments, the weights are based upon total weight of compound. In the compositions provided herein, an enantiomerically pure compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate or prodrug thereof can be present with other active or inactive ingredients. For example, a pharmaceutical composition comprising enantiomerically pure R-compound can comprise, for example, about 90% excipient and about 10% enantiomerically pure R-compound. In certain embodiments, the enantiomerically pure R-compound in such compositions can, for example, comprise, at least about 95% by weight R-compound and at most about 5% by weight S-compound, by total weight of the compound. For example, a pharmaceutical composition comprising enantiomerically pure S-compound can comprise, for example, about 90% excipient and about 10% enantiomerically pure S-compound. In certain embodiments, the enantiomerically pure S-compound in such compositions can, for example, comprise, at least about 95% by weight S-compound and at most about 5% by weight R-compound, by total weight of the compound. In certain embodiments, the active ingredient can be formulated with little or no excipient or carrier. The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art. One having ordinary skill in the art of organic synthesis will recognize that the maximum number of heteroatoms in a stable, chemically feasible heterocyclic ring, whether it is aromatic or non aromatic, is determined by the size of the ring, the degree of unsaturation and the valence of the heteroatoms. In general, a heterocyclic ring may have one to four heteroatoms so long as the heteroaromatic ring is chemically feasible and stable.

The present disclosure further provides bolaamphiphiles with histidine head groups. In one aspect of this embodiment, the alkyl chain is connected though the amine group of the imidazole of the histidine, providing cationic bolaamphiphiles with enhanced penetration through biological barriers such as the brain blood barrier (BBB). The alpha amino acid groups may undergo decarboxylation at given sites which lead to reorganization of the bolaamphiphile aggregate structures and release of encapsulated agents at the site of hydrolysis. In another aspect of this embodiment, the histidine groups may be attached to the alkyl chain through the carboxyl groups. Aggregate structures may also have enhanced transport through biological barriers because of the imidazole and since the conjugate acid (protonated form) of the imidazole side chain in histidine has a pKa of approximately 6.0 physiologically relevant pH values, relatively small shifts in pH will change its average charge and below a pH of 6, the imidazole ring is mostly protonated which would selectively disrupt the vesicles at this site and release the active agent. In another embodiment, the bola aggregates disclosed herein are useful for the delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) to specific sites and in one important embodiment to sites in the CNS that require penetration through neural blood barriers such as the blood brain barrier. mRNA is a large family of RNA molecules that convey genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where they specify the amino acid sequence of the protein products of gene expression. Following transcription of primary transcript mRNA Mature mRNA is translated into a polymer of amino acids: a protein, as summarized in the central dogma of molecular biology. By delivery of mRNA by the invented targeted delivery systems disease states such as but not limited to brain tumors and cancers, bacterial and viral and other microbial infections, and metabolic disorders may be treated (e.g., diabeties). The nano vesicles and bola complexes of the disclosure may be used to deliver mRNA to hepatocyte cells of the main tissue of the liver in order to control the following process for the prevention and treatment of diseases in which the following said processes are involved: protein synthesis, protein storage, carbohydrate transformation, synthesis of cholesterol, bile salts, and phospholipids, and detoxification, modification, and excretion of exogenous and endogenous substances. In a further embodiment, the present disclosure provides targeted delivery of Antisense oligonucleotides to specific sites and in one important embodiment to sites with neural blood barriers such as the CNS or brain which requires intact penetration across the BBB. Antisense oligonucleotides have many important application embodiments in the prevention and treatment of different diseases and disorders. Antisense oligonucleotides are single strands of DNA or RNA that are complementary to a chosen sequence. In the case of antisense RNA they prevent protein translation of certain messenger RNA strands by binding to them. Antisense DNA can be used to target a specific, complementary (coding or non-coding) RNA. If binding takes place this DNA/RNA hybrid can be degraded by the enzyme RNase H. Antisense oligonucleotides can be used as therapeutic agents that interfere with and block disease processes by altering the synthesis of a particular protein, by the binding of the antisense oligonucleotide to the mRNA from which that protein is normally synthesized. Binding of the two may physically block the ability of ribosomes to move along the messenger RNA preventing synthesis of the protein; hasten the rate at which the mRNA is degraded within the cytosol; and prevent splicing errors that would otherwise produce a defective protein. However, in order to be useful in human therapy, antisense oligonucleotides must be able to enter the target cells; avoid digestion by nucleases; and not cause dangerous side-effects. In order to achieve these goals, antisense oligonucleotides are encapsulated or complexed within the bolaamphiphile complexes and/or nano-vesicles of the disclosure, which can then resist digestion by nucleases; and be targeted to a given site using the ligand for the type of receptors found on desired target cells on the surface of the nano vesicles; antibodies decorating the surface of the nano particles directed against molecules on the surface of the desired target cells. In certain embodiments, examples of diseased states that can be treated by the presently-disclosed delivery of mRNA in the nano-vesicles and complexes of the disclosure include, for example, Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (successful infection of the liver by HCV requires that the liver produce a particular microRNA (miRNA-122). Injections of HCV-infected humans with an ODN (“miravirsen”) complementary to miRNA-122 suppresses the virus); HIV-1, the most frequent cause of AIDS in the United States; Ebola virus (the cause of the often-fatal Ebola hemorrhagic fever); human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (which frequently causes serious complications in AIDS patients); asthma (inhalation of an antisense oligonucleotide reduces the synthesis of cell receptors involved in asthma in at least one model system); certain cancers, (e.g., chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML); certain types of inflammation caused by cell-mediated immune reactions; Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); familial hypercholesterolemia (targets the mRNA for apolipoprotein B-100; e.g., On 31 Jan. 2013, the antisense ODN mipomersen (Kynamro®) received regulatory approval for use in humans with familial hypercholesterolemia). The present disclosure also provides novel nano vesicles with surface decorated with peptides with the binding characteristics of tetanus toxin showed strong binding to PC12, primary motor neurons, and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells. The enhanced neuronal binding affinity and specificity of peptide targeting ligands to tetanus, has application for targeting neurotherapeutic proteins and viral vectors in the treatment of motor neuron disease, neuropathy, and pain. In one embodiment comprises the use of peptide targeting ligand to tetanus on motor neurons as application in delivery of SiRNA or NTF such as GDNF for the treatment of ALS. In one non limiting embodiment, the novel peptide is that described in Neurobiol Dis. 2005 August; 19(3):407-18 by Liu et al., has the binding characteristics of tetanus toxin has application in therapeutic protein and vector motor and sensory neuron targeting. In another embodiment, the enhanced neuronal binding affinity and specificity of Tet1, a novel 12 amino acid peptide, is used for targeting neurotherapeutic proteins and viral vectors in the treatment of motor neuron disease, neuropathy, and pain. The advantage of using the delivery systems based on bolaamphilies nano-vesicles and/or complexes disclose herein comprising the described targeting ligands is improved stability, penetration through biological barriers and selective release at the target site. That is, the tetanus targeting ligand is but one example of the other peptides with the binding characteristics of tetanus toxin. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present disclosure provides bolaamphiphiles with histidine head groups and bola nano-vesicles and complexes for delivery of active agents that include/comprise the said bolaamphiphile with the said histidine head groups. In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides bola nano-vesicles and complexes with mRNA for delivery to sites including but not limited to the brain, for treatment of diseases and disorders as described herein. In a further embodiment, the present disclosure also provides a method for delivery to the brain after systemic administration of the bolaamphiphile aggregates and nano vesicles comprising a therapeutic agent. In another embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method for delivery of bolaamphiphile aggregates and nano vesicles comprising a therapeutic agent of the disclosure to hepatocyte cells of the liver and the management of the diseases or disorder described above. In a further embodiment, the present disclosure provides bolaamphiphile nano-vesicles and complexes with Antisense oligonucleotides for delivery to sites such as but not limited to the brain for treatment of diseases and disorders as described above. In a still further embodiment, the present disclosure also provides a method for the delivery of therapeutic bolaamphiphile nano-vesicles and complexes of the disclosure to the brain after systemic administration. In a further embodiment, the present disclosure also provides bolaamphiphile nano-vesicles and complexes having all or part of a surface decorated with peptides having the binding characteristics of tetanus toxin. In one aspect of this embodiment, these aggregate structures are administered for treatment of motor neuron disease, neuropathy, and pain, e.g., in one non limiting aspect, treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The Derivatives and Precursors disclosed can be prepared as illustrated in the Schemes provided herein. The syntheses can involve initial construction of, for example, vernonia oil or direct functionalization of natural derivatives by organic synthesis manipulations such as, but not limiting to, epoxide ring opening. In those processes involving oxiranyl ring opening, the epoxy group is opened by the addition of reagents such as carboxylic acids or organic or inorganic nucleophiles. Such ring opening results in a mixture of two products in which the new group is introduced at either of the two carbon atoms of the epoxide moiety. This provides beta substituted alcohols in which the substitution position most remote from the CO group of the main aliphatic chain of the vernonia oil derivative is arbitrarily assigned as position 1, while the neighboring substituted carbon position is designated position 2. For simplicity purposes only, the Derivatives and Precursors shown herein may indicate structures with the hydroxy group always at position 2 but the Derivatives and Precursors wherein the hydroxy is at position 1 are also encompassed by the invention. Thus, a radical of the formula —CH(OH)—CH(R)— refers to the substitution of —OH at either the carbon closer to the CO group, designated position 2 or to the carbon at position 1. Moreover, with respect to the preparation of symmetrical bolaamphiphiles made via introducing the head groups through an epoxy moiety (e.g., as in vernolic acid) or a double bond (—C═C—) as in mono unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid) a mixture of three different derivatives will be produced. In certain embodiments, vesicles are prepared using the mixture of unfractionated positional isomers. In one aspect of this embodiment, where one or more bolas are prepared from vernolic acid, and in which a hydroxy group as well as the head group introduced through an epoxy or a fatty acid with the head group introduced through a double bond (—C═C—), the bola used in vesicle preparation can actually be a mixture of three different positional isomers. In other embodiments, the three different derivatives are isolated. Accordingly, the vesicles disclosed herein can be made from a mixture of the three isomers of each derivative or, in other embodiments, the individual isomers can be isolated and used for preparation of vesicles. Symmetrical bolaamphiphiles can form relatively stable self aggregate vesicle structures by the use of additives such as cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives (e.g., cholesterol hemisuccinate, cholesterol oleyl ether, anionic and cationic derivatives of cholesterol and the like), or other additives including single headed amphiphiles with one, two or multiple aliphatic chains such as phospholipids, zwitterionic, acidic, or cationic lipids. Examples of zwitterionic lipids are phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanol amines and sphingomyelins. Examples of acidic amphiphilic lipids are phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylinositols, and phosphatidic acids. Examples of cationic amphipathic lipids are diacyl trimethylammonium propanes, diacyl dimethylammonium propanes, and stearylamines cationic amphiphiles such as spermine cholesterol carbamates, and the like, in optimum concentrations which fill in the larger spaces on the outer surfaces, and/or add additional hydrophilicity to the particles. Such additives may be added to the reaction mixture during formation of nanoparticles to enhance stability of the nanoparticles by filling in the void volumes of in the upper surface of the vesicle membrane. Stability of nano vesicles according to the present disclosure can be demonstrated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). For example, suspensions of the vesicles can be left to stand for 1, 5, 10, and 30 days to assess the stability of the nanoparticle solution/suspension and then analyzed by DLS and TEM. The vesicles disclosed herein may encapsulate within their core the active agent, which in particular embodiments is selected from peptides, proteins, nucleotides and or non-polymeric agents. In certain embodiments, the active agent is also associated via one or more non-covalent interactions to the vesicular membrane on the outer surface and/or the inner surface, optionally as pendant decorating the outer or inner surface, and may further be incorporated into the membrane surrounding the core. In certain aspects, biologically active peptides, proteins, nucleotides or non-polymeric agents that have a net electric charge, may associate ionically with oppositely charged headgroups on the vesicle surface and/or form salt complexes therewith. In particular aspects of these embodiments, additives which may be bolaamphiphiles or single headed amphiphiles, comprise one or more branching alkyl chains bearing polar or ionic pendants, wherein the aliphatic portions act as anchors into the vesicle's membrane and the pendants (e.g., chitosan derivatives or polyamines or certain peptides) decorate the surface of the vesicle to enhance penetration through various biological barriers such as the intestinal tract and the BBB, and in some instances are also selectively hydrolyzed at a given site or within a given organ. The concentration of these additives is readily adjusted according to experimental determination. In certain embodiments, the oral formulations of the present disclosure comprise agents that enhance penetration through the membranes of the GI tract and enable passage of intact nanoparticles containing the drug. These agents may be any of the additives mentioned above and, in particular aspects of these embodiment, include chitosan and derivatives thereof, serving as vehicle surface ligands, as decorations or pendants on the vesicles, or the agents may be excipients added to the formulation. In other embodiments, the nanoparticles and vesicles disclosed herein may comprise the fluorescent marker carboxyfluorescein (CF) encapsulated therein while in particular aspects, the nanoparticle and vesicles of the present disclosure may be decorated with one or more of PEG, e.g. PEG2000-vernonia derivatives as pendants. For example, two kinds of PEG-vernonia derivatives can be used: PEG-ether derivatives, wherein PEG is bound via an ether bond to the oxygen of the opened epoxy ring of, e.g., vernolic acid and PEG-ester derivatives, wherein PEG is bound via an ester bond to the carboxylic group of, e.g., vernolic acid. In other embodiments, vesicles, made from synthetic amphiphiles, as well as liposomes, made from synthetic or natural phospholipids, substantially (or totally) isolate the therapeutic agent from the environment allowing each vesicle or liposome to deliver many molecules of the therapeutic agent. Moreover, the surface properties of the vesicle or liposome can be modified for biological stability, enhanced penetration through biological barriers and targeting, independent of the physico-chemical properties of the encapsulated drug. In still other embodiments, the headgroup is selected from: (i) choline or thiocholine, O-alkyl, N-alkyl or ester derivatives thereof; (ii) non-aromatic amino acids with functional side chains such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid, lysine or cysteine, or an aromatic amino acid such as tyrosine, tryptophan, phenylalanine and derivatives thereof such as levodopa (3,4-dihydroxy-phenylalanine) and p-aminophenylalanine; (iii) a peptide or a peptide derivative that is specifically cleaved by an enzyme at a diseased site selected from enkephalin, N-acetyl-ala-ala, a peptide that constitutes a domain recognized by beta and gamma secretases, and a peptide that is recognized by stromelysins; (iv) saccharides such as glucose, mannose and ascorbic acid; and (v) other compounds such as nicotine, cytosine, lobeline, polyethylene glycol, a cannabinoid, or folic acid.

Additional embodiments within the scope provided herein are set forth in non-limiting fashion elsewhere herein and in the examples. It should be understood that these examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting in any manner.

Depending on the intended route of delivery, the compounds provided herein are preferably formulated as either injectable or oral compositions or as salves, as lotions or as patches all for transdermal administration. The compositions for oral administration can take the form of bulk liquid solutions or suspensions, or bulk powders. More commonly, however, the compositions are presented in unit dosage forms to facilitate accurate dosing. The term “unit dosage forms” refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. Typical unit dosage forms include prefilled, premeasured ampules or syringes of the liquid compositions or pills, tablets, capsules or the like in the case of solid compositions. In such compositions, the compound is usually a minor component (from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight or preferably from about 1 to about 40% by weight) with the remainder being various vehicles or carriers and processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form. Liquid forms suitable for oral administration may include a suitable aqueous or nonaqueous vehicle with buffers, suspending and dispensing agents, colorants, flavors and the like. Solid forms may include, for example, any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.

Other materials as well as processing techniques and the like are set forth in Part 8 of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th edition, 1985, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania, which is incorporated herein by reference. The above-described components for orally administrable, injectable, or topically administrable compositions are merely representative. Other materials as well as processing techniques and the like are set forth in Part 8 of Remington's The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st edition, 2005, Publisher: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, which is incorporated herein by reference.

A description of representative sustained release materials can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. The present invention also relates to the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formula I. The following formulation examples illustrate representative pharmaceutical compositions that may be prepared in accordance with this invention. The present invention, however, is not limited to the following pharmaceutical compositions. Formulation 1—Injection A compound of the invention may be dissolved or suspended in a buffered sterile saline injectable aqueous medium to a concentration of approximately 5 mg/mL. Methods of Treatment Bolaamphiphilic vesicles (bolavesicles) may have certain advantages over conventional liposomes as potential vehicles for drug delivery. Bolavesicles have thinner membranes than comparable liposomal bilayer, and therefore possess bigger inner volume and hence higher encapsulation capacity than liposomes of the same diameter. Moreover, bolavesicles are more physically-stable than conventional liposomes, but can be destabilized in a triggered fashion (e.g., by hydrolysis of the headgroups using a specific enzymatic reaction) thus allowing controlled release of the encapsulated material at the site of action (i.e., drug targeting). Specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) designed to silence different oncogenic pathways can be used for cancer therapy. However, in the blood stream, non-modified naked non-modified siRNAs are unstable, thus having a short half-life in the blood stream and encounter difficulties in crossing biological membranes due to their negative charge. Therefore, siRNAs may not be used efficiently to silence genes. These obstacles can be overcome by using siRNAs complexed with bolaamphiphiles, consisting of two positively charged head groups that flank a hydrophobic chain. Bolaamphiphiles have relatively low toxicities, long persistence in the blood stream, and most importantly, can form poly-cationic micelles in aqueous conditions thus, becoming amenable to association with negatively charged siRNAs. Experiments confirmed the formation of stable complexes the bolaamphiphiles of the present invention those can protect nucleic acids from their degradation and thus effectively deliver siRNAs into the cells causing the silencing of target genes. General Synthetic Procedures The compounds provided herein can be purchased or prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. See, e.g., Synthetic Schemes below. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures. Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group as well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups, and their introduction and removal, are described in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Second Edition, Wiley, New York, 1991, and references cited therein. The compounds provided herein may be isolated and purified by known standard procedures. Such procedures include (but are not limited to) recrystallization, column chromatography or HPLC. The following schemes are presented with details as to the preparation of representative substituted biarylamides that have been listed herein. The compounds provided herein may be prepared from known or commercially available starting materials and reagents by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. The enantiomerically pure compounds provided herein may be prepared according to any techniques known to those of skill in the art. For instance, they may be prepared by chiral or asymmetric synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or obtained from a racemate by any conventional technique, for example, by chromatographic resolution using a chiral column, TLC or by the preparation of diastereoisomers, separation thereof and regeneration of the desired enantiomer. See, e.g., “Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions,” by J. Jacques, A. Collet, and S.H. Wilen, (Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1981); S. H. Wilen, A. Collet, and J.

Enantiomerically pure compounds can also be recovered either from the crystallized diastereomer or from the mother liquor, depending on the solubility properties of the particular acid resolving agent employed and the particular acid enantiomer used. The identity and optical purity of the particular compound so recovered can be determined by polarimetry or other analytical methods known in the art.

Briefly, the carboxylic group of methyl vernolate or vernolic acid was interacted with aliphatic diols to obtain bisvernolesters. Then the epoxy group of the vernolate moiety, located on C12 and C13 of the aliphatic chain of vernolic acid, was used to introduce two ACh headgroups on the two vicinal carbons obtained after the opening of the oxirane ring. For GLH-20 (Table 1), the ACh head group was attached to the vernolate skeleton through the nitrogen atom of the choline moiety. The bolaamphiphile was prepared in a two-stage synthesis: First, opening of the epoxy ring with a haloacetic acid and, second, quaternization with the N,N-dimethylamino ethyl acetate. For GLH-19 (Table 1) that contains an ACh head group attached to the vernolate skeleton through the acetyl group, the bolaamphiphile was prepared in a three-stage synthesis, including opening of the epoxy ring with glutaric acid, then esterification of the free carboxylic group with N,N-dimethyl amino ethanol and the final product was obtained by quaternization of the head group, using methyl iodide followed by exchange of the iodide ion by chloride using an ion exchange resin. Each bolaamphiphile was characterized by mass spectrometry, NMR and IR spectroscopy. The purity of the two bolaamphiphiles was >97% as determined by HPLC. Materials: Diphenyl ether, 1,2-hexadecanediol, oleic acid, oleylamine, and carboxyfluorescein (CF) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Rehovot, Israel). Chloroform and ethanol were purchased from Bio-Lab Ltd. Jerusalem, Israel. 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (DMPG), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DMPE), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), cholesterol (CHOL), cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHEMS) were purchased from Avanti Lipids (Alabaster, Ala., USA), The diacetylenic monomer 10,12-tricosadiynoic acid was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany), and purified by dissolving the powder in chloroform, filtering the resulting solution through a 0.45 pm nylon filter (Whatman Inc., Clifton, N.J., USA), and evaporation of the solvent. 1-(4 trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH) was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, Oreg., USA). Synthesis of Representative Bolaamphiphilic Compounds The synthesis of bolaamphiphilic compounds of this invention can be carried out in accordance with the methods described previously (Chemistry and Physics of Lipids 2008, 153, 85-97; Journal of Liposome Research 2010, 20, 147-59; WO2002/055011; WO2003/047499; or WO2010/128504) and using the appropriate reagents, starting materials, and purification methods known to those skilled in the art.

The organic solvent is evaporated under nitrogen and then is kept under vacuum overnight. The thin film that was formed is hydrated by RNAs-free water to a concentration of 10 mg/ml of the bolaamphiphile and the suspension which was formed after mixing is sonicated to form 100 nm vesicles at a concentration of 10 mg/ml of bolaamphiphile. These vesicles are used to form the complex with the siRNA duplex as described below. The siRNA duplex is mixed with pre-prepared vesicles (concentration of the siRNA ranges between 100 nM and 10 μM, and the concentration of the bolaamphiphile ranges between 200 μg/ml and 1 mg/ml). The vesicles that are prepared at a concentration of the bolaamphiphile of 10 mg/ml are diluted before mixing to a concentration that ranges between 200 μg/ml and 1 mg/ml. The mixture is allowed to stand on ice for 30 min-24 hours. EXAMPLE 3 Transfection of Cell Cultures with Bolaamphiphile/siRNA Complexes All transfections are performed using bolaamphiphiles of the invention. The concentration of siRNA (200 nM-lOμM) to bolaamphiphiles (200 μg/ml-1 mg/ml) can be 10×-1000×. The transfection is done with either eGFP siRNA that can silence the eGFP gene, which is expressed by the transfected cells. Alternatively, to determine if the siRNA penetrated into the cells, the inventors used siRNA-fluorescent probe conjugate. The fluorescent probe could be FITC or Alexa Flour such as AF-555. Prior to each transfection, the cell media is swapped with growth medium without serum and the prepared siRNA/ bolaamphiphile vesicles complexes (as described in Example 2) are diluted to the final concentration of 1×. The cells are incubated for 5-12 hours followed by changing the media to the growth medium. EXAMPLE 4 Fluorescent Light Microscopy To assess the silencing efficiency, or the number of the fluorescent cells in the case where non-fluorescent cells were transfected by siRNA-fluorescent probe conjugate, cells are imaged 72 hours after the transfection or 5-24 hours after the transfection, respectively, with a fluorescent microscope. EXAMPLE 5 Imaging Isolated Organs After Administration of siRNA/Bolaamphiphile Vesicle Complex to Mice siRNA/bolaamphiphile vesicles complex, prepared by mixing siRNA-AF555 conjugate with bolaamphiphilic vesicles (as described in example 2 above), was injected intravenously to mice via the tail vein. The injected dose ranged between 20 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg of the bolaamphiphile. Mice were sacrificed 30 min and 2 hours after the injection and organs were washed by saline and fluorescence imaging of the isolated organs was performed. Based on the results, it can be determined that bolaamphiles have the potential to be used as the carriers for siRNA delivery. Bola/siRNA vesicle complexes significantly increase the stability of siRNAs, provided resistence against nucleases activity and provide excellent intracellular uptake followed by a specific gene silencing. Moreover, depending on application, the extent of protection of siRNA can be altered by simply changing the carrier. EXAMPLE 6 Bolaamphiphiles with a Histidine Head Group A bolaamphiphile similar to the structure of GLH-19 is formed wherein, instead of the binding of the acetylchloline head groups through the amino group, a histidine is used instead and the histidine is bound through its alpha-amino group. The synthesis of this bolaamphiphilic is carried out in accordance with the methods described previously (Chemistry and Physics of Lipids 2008, 153, 85-97; Journal of Liposome Research 2010, 20, 147-59; WO2002/055011; WO2003/047499; and/or WO2010/128504) and methods known in the art using reagents, starting materials, and purification methods known to those skilled in the art. More specifically, vesicles are prepared by dissolving 10 mg/ml of the histidine bolaamphiphile in chloroform together with 2.1 mg/ml cholesteryl hemisuccinate and 1.6 mg/ml cholesterol. The organic solvent is evaporated under nitrogen and then is kept under vacuum overnight. The thin film that is formed is hydrated in water at pH 6.8, to a concentration of 10 mg/ml of the bolaamphiphile and the suspension formed after mixing is sonicated to form 100 nm vesicles at a concentration of 10 mg/ml of bolaamphiphile. These vesicles are stable at the concentration formed and upon dilution and show very good shelf like. When placed in pH 4 -5 solution they disrupt upon protonation of the Nitrogen of the imidzoale ring, releasing an encapsulated marker such as carboxyfluorescein. EXAMPLE 7 Formation of Bolaamphiphiles mRNA Complex Vesicles are prepared by dissolving 10 mg/ml bolaamphiphile (GLH 19 and GLH 20 in a ratio of 2/1) in chloroform together with 2.1 mg/ml cholesteryl hemisuccinate and 1.6 mg/ml cholesterol. The organic solvent is evaporated under nitrogen and then is kept under vacuum overnight. The thin film that is formed is hydrated by a mRNAs-water mixture to a concentration of 10 mg/ml of the bolaamphiphile and the suspension which is formed after mixing is sonicated to form 100 nm vesicles at a concentration of 10 mg/ml of bolaamphiphile. These vesicles are used to form the complex with the mRNA duplex as described below. In this example both 1.8 kB transcript and a 6.2 kB mRNA are successfully encapsulated. The mRNA duplex is mixed with pre-prepared vesicles (concentration of the mRNA ranges between 100 nM and 10 p.M, and the concentration of the bolaamphiphile ranges between 200 pg/ml and 1 mg/ml) with 60 to 90% encapsulation efficiency as a function of the mRNA concentration, the mRNA molecular weight, and the bolaamphiphile concentrations. The vesicles that are prepared at a concentration of the bolaamphiphile of 10 mg/ml are diluted before mixing to a concentration that ranges between 200 pg/ml and 1 mg/ml. The mixture is allowed to stand on ice for 30 min-24 hours. These vesicles have a 60 to 90% encapsulation of the particular mRNA used, with the veseicles having an average diameter of between 80 to 90 nano-meters (nm) and a cationic surface charge. EXAMPLE 8 Delivery of mRNA to the Liver with Bolaamphiphile Vesicles Nano-vesicle complexes prepared in the above examples are used to encapsulate different mRNA for delivery to hepatocyte cells of the liver. As a function of the mRNA encapsulated they are shown to be efficacious in the prevention and treatment of diseases in which the following processes are involved: protein synthesis, protein storage, carbohydrate transformation, synthesis of cholesterol, bile salts, and phospholipids, and detoxification, modification, and excretion of exogenous and endogenous substances. The same formulations also showed good BBB penetration and uptake into the CNS. Uptake in the CNS and penetration through biological barriers such as the BBB are improved in vesicles formulated with bolaamphiphiles with at least one head group being chitosan such as GLH 55a and are added together with the GLH 19 and GLH 20 in a range of about, but not limited to lmg/ml. In each preparation described above, the vesicles are stable and can protect the nucleotides from nucleases. Upon disruption by head group hydrolysis or alteration the nucleotides are released in a fully-active form. EXAMPLE 9 Delivery of mRNA to the Liver Using Histidine Head Group Containing Vesicles Bolaamphiphiles having the histine head groups, (Example 6) are used instead of GLH 19 and GLH 20 (as in Exampled 7 and 8) for encapsulation of mRNA. Vsicles of about 100nm are achieved which show good cell uptake in hepatocte cells and relelase of an active agent within these cells. EXAMPLE 10 Encapsulation and Delivery of Antisense Oligonucleotides Vesicle formation and encapsulation are carried out as in Example 8, above, but using antisense oligonucleotides instead of mRNA as the active agent being encapsulated. Vesicle-both with and without chitosan bolaamphilies (e.g., GLH 55)—are prepared and have an average vesicle complexant size of 60 to 110 nm. The vesicles show good transfection into cells and intact penetration across biological barriers such as the BBB and delivery into the brain. The vesicles are stable and can protect the oligonucleotides from nucleases. Upon disruption by head group hydrolysis or alteration, the antisense oligo nucleotides are released in a fully-active form. EXAMPLE 11 Bolaamphiphile Vesicles Comprising Peptide Head Groups Vesicle formation and encapsulation are carried out as in Example 8, above, in compositions of GLH 19 and GLH 20 using the chitosan bolaamphiphile GLH 55, and in addition, with a bolaamphiphile having a head group comprising the novel peptide described in Neurobiol Dis. 2005 August; 19(3):407-18 by Liu et al., a peptide having the binding characteristics of tetanus toxin. These vesicle complexes are used to encapsulate GDNF (0.2mg/10 ml) with an encapsualtion of 90% in vesicles of 100nm diameter. The GDNF remains active when encapsulated and upon release upon vesicle decapsulation after vesicle surface bolaamphiphile head group hydrolysis. When injected into mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) they are shown to have significantly better efficacy as compared to control vesicles without this peptide ligand. EXAMPLE 12 Bolaamphiphile Vesicles Comprising Tet-1 Peptide Head Groups Example 11 is repeated except that the boloaamphiphile head group is Tet1, a novel 12 amino acid peptide, that is used for targeting neurotherapeutic proteins instead of the targeting peptide used in Example 11. Equally good efficacy is shown (as compared to vesicles of Example 11 comprising peptide having the binding characteristics of tetanus toxin as head group) which efficiency is significantly better than as seen with vesciles without the peptide ligand.
