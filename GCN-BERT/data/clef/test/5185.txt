FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a glass composition, and more particularly to a glass composition capable of intensively absorbing ultraviolet rays and infrared rays, and an application of the same. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Due to global warming, related foreign companies, represented by Perfect Products Group (PPG) in America, have invested heavily in researches in the aspect of ultraviolet ray and near infrared ray-absorbing insulating glass. As many as more than 300 international patents in this have been applied. Among them, as many as more than 100 patents in the field have been applied in Japan, accounting for ⅓ of patents in the field of glass energy-saving and emission-reducing technology in the world. Major Japanese companies that have applied for patents include CENTRA, GLASS, CLLTD, NIPPON SHEETGLASS COLTD and ASAHIGLASS and so on. A glass system capable of absorbing ultraviolet rays and near infrared rays, which is researched by NIPPON SHEET GLASS COLTD is soda-lime-silica glass having a coloring component Fe2O3 accounting for 0.4% to 0.58%, wherein FeO accounts for 20% to 30% of the total iron content, CeO2 0.8% to 1.8% while TiO2 0% to 0.5% and CoO 0.0001% to 0.002%. The glass is 2 mm thick with a transmittance of visible light (LTA) of 75% to 79%, a Total Solar Ultraviolet Transmittance (TSUV) of 20% to 25%, and a Total Solar Energy Transmittance (TSET) of 52% to 55%, thus having general insulating and ultraviolet-proof effect. British company Pilkington has applied for a glass composition patent (Chinese patent application Number 94191094.6). This kind of soda-lime-silica glass capable of absorbing infrared rays and ultraviolet rays has a Fe2O3 content of 0.25% to 1.75%. However, the content of FeO is only 0.007, thus infrared rays cannot be absorbed. For 4 mm thick glass, the LTA is only 32%, the TSET is larger than or equal to 50% and the TSUV is smaller than or equal to 25%. In most soda-lime-silica glass composition patents, colorants include Fe, Co, Cr, Mn, Ti and so on, and the color is characterized by a dominant wavelength of 480 nm to 510 nm and an excitation purity (Pe) which is not larger than 20%. For 5 mm thick glass, the TSUV is 25% to 35%, the Transmittance of infrared ray (TSIR) is 20% to 25%, and the TSET 46% to 50%. American company PPG has applied for patents U.S. Pat. No. 4,381,934, U.S. Pat. No. 4,886,539, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,792,536 and 9,713,805 etc. and a method for producing float glass having super heat absorptivity by using a plurality of independent stages of melting and clarification is invented, characterized in that oxidation-reduction reaction conditions can be controlled effectively and glass having more than 50% of FeO, high LTA, low TSIR and super heat absorptivity is produced and has applied for a patent in China. The invention is entitled an infrared and ultraviolet radiation absorbing blue glass composition (application Number 98810129.7). The FeO ratio is as high as 35% to 60%, and for 4 mm thick green glass, the LTA is 72.5%, the TSIR is 21%, the TSET is 47.5%; for 4 mm thick blue glass, the LTA is 75%, the TSIR is 17.5%, the TSET is 49.5% and can be produced by a conventional float process. This is a patent technology of glass having super heat absorptivity, which represents the highest level in the glass industry in the world. However, ideal glass having super heat absorptivity cannot be realized yet. In a nitrate-free method (patent Number: 98808824) for preparing a blue glass composition of American Ford Motor Company, basic components of a colorant of the blue glass composition include: 0.4% of Fe2O3, 0.15% of MnO2, 0.005% to 0.025% of CoO, 0% to 1% of TiO2 and a reducing agent anthracite etc. At a thickness of 4 mm, the LTA of the blue glass is 50% to 68%, the TSIR is 21% to 30%, the TSUV is 25% to 40% and the TSET is 48% to 50%. Japanese company Central Glass Co., Ltd. has applied for a patent (200480031885.6) of ultraviolet ray and infrared ray-absorbing green glass, wherein a colorant include 0.3% to 0.5% of Fe2O3, 0.8% to 2% of CeO2, 0.1% to 0.7% of SnO and 0.8% to 2% of TiO2. The dominant wavelength of the glass is 550 nm to 570 nm, the LTA is 70%, the TSUV is 20% and the TSIR is 25%. French glass company Saint Gobain has applied for a patent (patent Number: 200680011222.7) of a glass composition for producing an ultraviolet ray and infrared ray-absorbing glass window, including 65% to 80% of SiO2, 0% to 5% of Al2O3, 0% to 5% of B2O3, 5% to 15% of CaO, 0% to 2% of MgO, 9% to 18% of Na2O, 0% to 10% of K2O, 0% to 5% of BaO, 0.7% to 1.6% of Fe2O3, 0.1% to 1.2% of CeO and 0% to 1.5% of TiO2. The reduction oxidation ratio is smaller than 0.23. At a thickness of 4 mm, the LTA of the glass is larger than or equal to 70%, the TSIR is 28%, the TSUV is 18%, and the TSET is larger than or equal to 48%. Because the iron content is too high, the temperature difference between the upper part and the lower part of the melt glass is about 300 degrees centigrade, thus the shaping process is difficult and mass production cannot be realized. Domestic patents related to heat-absorbing glass: there are very few researches on ultraviolet ray and near infrared ray-absorbing glass in China. Most patents in China in recent years, which go against and deviate from the spectral crystal lattice structure and shaping processes of soda-lime silicate glass, cannot be implemented. The only exception is a patent of “green glass having high ultraviolet ray and infrared ray absorptivity” (patent Number: 03117080.3) of Shanghai Yaohua Pilkington Glass Company. The glass is dark green. The TSUV is 17%, the TSIR is 28%, the LTA is smaller than 79% and the iron content is 0.5% to 0.9%. Due to a relatively low Fe+2 content which is 18% to 28%, the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) chemical oxygen value is low, the temperature difference between the upper part and the lower part of the melt glass is large, the shaping process is difficult and can be hardly implemented, and the heat absorbing effect is bad. Shenzhen Southern Glass Group has applied for a patent of “green glass selectively absorbing solar spectrum” (application Number: 200410051479.8). The LTA of the glass is larger than or equal to 70%, the TSUV is smaller than or equal to 16%, the TSIR is relatively low, the TSET is larger than or equal to 50% and the dominant wavelength is 495 nm to 520 nm. Luoyang Float Glass Group has applied for a patent of “vehicle green glass colorant” (application Number: 200510107206.5), wherein the use amount of Fe2O3 is 0.4% to 1.5% and bivalent iron Fe+2 only accounts for 25% to 40% of the total iron content, thus near infrared rays cannot be absorbed obviously. The LTA is larger than or equal to 70%, the TSUV is smaller than or equal to 15% and the TSET is larger than or equal to 50%, thus resulting in bad heat insulating effect. Fuyao Glass Group has applied for a patent of “ultraviolet-proof soda lime-silicate glass” (application Number: 200810072276.5). The Fe2O3 content of the glass is 0.3% to 1.1%, the oxidation reduction coefficient is only 0.22 to 0.36, the LTA is larger than or equal to 70%, the TSUV is smaller than or equal to 15%, and the glass has a low near infrared absorptivity. In a patent of infrared insulating heat absorbing glass (application Number: 201110189471.8), since the SnO2 content and the ZnO content are too high, flaws are easily generated in the glass surface, and the glass can be hardly shaped through a float process. In addition, the LTA is seriously affected and the insulating effect is not ideal. To sum up, the technological level of glass having super heat absorptivity both at home and abroad are trapped in using ferrous oxides alone to reduce the transmittance of near infrared rays while using ferrous oxides alone to reduce the transmittance of near infrared rays can be hardly achieved by the prior art. In physical linear optics, it is very difficult to enable lights of a certain wave band to pass while enabling absorption of lights of other wave bands. If the content of Fe2+ iron ions is improved only by adding a large amount of iron oxide to glass, the LTA of the glass will be largely reduced, and the glass is easily colored in amber to affect the appearance, making it difficult to obtain insulating glass with high LTA and low TSIR, TSUV and TS ET. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide a glass composition capable of improving ultraviolet ray and infrared ray absorption of glass.

Ultraviolet lights at 380 nmr to 400 nmr can be hardly seen by human eyes, and can only be seen by insects including bees etc., so ultraviolet lights at 380 nmr to 400 nmr cannot be included in the sun light white balance region mmw. Therefore, it is defined by modern medicine that the sun light white balance region is located within 400 nm to 760 nm.

In physical linear optics, it is very difficult to enable lights of a certain wave band to pass while enabling absorption of lights of other wave bands. Therefore, such assumption should be realized by the principle of photochemical quenching. This technology applies the reversible principle in photochemistry and photophysics, applies compounds of quenching agents and deactivators convert harmful ultraviolet energy into harmless heat energy which is released. Similarly, the rare metals and rare earth metals are produced into a glass main body coloring and coordinating part by using the quenching agents and deactivators with very high molar extinction coefficients through oxidation reduction reactions, thus effectively absorbing ultraviolet rays while absorbing near infrared rays and keeping most passages for visible lights to overcome full absorption of black bodies in physical optics, stop automatic oxidation reaction so as to obtain a compound structure having stable molecular valence. When applying the same materials, thicker glass will have lower LTA, TSIR, TSUV and TSET, higher Pe, smaller SC and better the insulating effect. A larger Fe2O3 oxidation reduction coefficient will result in lower TSET and better insulating effect. Different from traditional insulating glass technology, this technology applies Fe+2 iron ions to color the framework foundation center. The framework foundation center is colored in blue green by bivalent iron and yellow green by trivalent iron. The glass main body coloring and coordinating part is applied for multi-element complementation and energy coordination. Using the technologies including self-bubbling, natural diffusion, and homogenization and clarification, the melt glass is uniform and clear and the temperature difference between the upper part and lower part is small, completely satisfying requirements of a float or Glaverbel production process. In the present invention, the adding proportion of an ultraviolet ray and infrared ray-absorbing glass main body coloring and coordinating part in basic components of conventional silicate heat-absorbing glass is determined according to different glass thicknesses to generate different tunes of heat-absorbing glass colors. The ultraviolet ray and infrared ray-absorbing glass main body coloring and coordinating part uses Fe2O3 as a base material. The reduction oxidation ratio of Fe2O3 in the glass composition is controlled in the range of 0.4 to 4.8. In glass with different thicknesses, reduction oxidation ratios are different. Ferrous oxide (FeO) which represents Fe+2 iron accounts for 40% to 80% of the total iron (Fe2O3) content, preferably 50% to 80%. The total iron concentration of Fe2O3 is 0.22% to 1.35%. The total iron concentration refers to the percentage concentration by weight of iron elements Fe+2 and Fe+3 in the glass composition. The iron-to-oxygen ratio changes in the range of Fe0.83-0.95O (weight ratio). When the thickness of the glass composition is 2.0 mm to 5.0 mm, the total iron concentration of Fe2O3 in the basic glass components is 0.5% to 1.2% (weight ratio). When the thickness of the glass composition is 6 mm to 15 mm, the total iron concentration of Fe2O3 in the basic glass components is 0.22% to 0.5% (weight ratio), the reduction oxidation ratio is not changed and other assistants and coordinating agents may apply relatively low formulation concentrations. In the ultraviolet ray and infrared ray-absorbing glass composition of the present invention, the glass main body coloring and coordinating part is added in basic components of soda-lime-silica glass of the components above. A part or all of the components may be combined according to the thickness of the produced glass and requirements of spectral properties to shape the glass through a float glass process or a Glaverbel process. In the basic composition of the soda-lime-silica glass, the highest total iron content is not larger than 1.35%, otherwise, the LTA will be seriously affected, wherein in the glass composition, absorbing components for auxiliary coordination in the infrared region include: Fe2O3, CuO, WO3, CeO2, Cr2O3, B2O3, MnO, SrO, ZrO2+HfO2; components for preventing glare and coordinating absorption in the visible light region include: ZrO2+HfO2, MnO, SrO and P2O5, and components for coordinating absorption in the ultraviolet region include: CeO2, TiO2, ZnO, Sb2O3 and Cr2O3. In addition, in the present invention, the components of the glass composition exclude any one of Ni, Cd, As, Pb, Be, SnO and SnCl. Raw materials of the elements above are eliminated, e.g. SnCl is not used as a physical decoloring agent or a near infrared assistant absorbent and it is best not to use sulfates as glass clarifying agents, because sulfate glass clarifying agents will react with Ni at high temperature and it is possible to generate nickel sulfite stones in the glass. Nickel sulfite stones, which are extremely tiny oval spheres and cannot be found through a normal detection method, will lead to spontaneous rupture of the glass due to thermal expansion and contraction during a backfire process, long-term use, a tempering process or sunlight irradiation of the glass. Therefore, use amounts and particle diameter fineness should be controlled correctly, and in particular, a clarifying agent should be used correctly to prevent generation of nickel sulfite stones and strictly prevent potential spontaneous ruptures of the glass. Thus the patent technology stops the use of nickel oxide as a near infrared assistant absorbent to greatly improve the use security of a glass composition finished product. A method for producing the ultraviolet ray and infrared ray-absorbing glass composition of the present invention may apply a float glass process or a Glaverbel process. During preparation of the glass composition, a reducing agent is added. The reducing agent includes carbon powder and anthracite powder in a use amount of 0.005% to 0.05%, and may further include any one or two of zinc powder or copper powder. Preferably, during preparation of the glass composition, a clarifying agent is further added. The clarifying agent includes the following components (weight ratio): 0.05% to 1% of Na2SO4, 0.01% to 1.5% of BaSO4, 0.01% to 1.8% of CeO2, 0.01% to 1.5% of CaF, and 0% to 0.2% of Sb2O3. The clarifying agent may be decomposed at high temperature during a glass melting process to generate a gas or reduce the melt glass viscosity so as to eliminate air bubbles in the melt glass. Preferably, during preparation of the glass composition, a cleaning agent is further added. The content (weight ratio) of the cleaning agent is 0.02% to 1.5% so as to prevent fog, remove frost and clean the glass.
