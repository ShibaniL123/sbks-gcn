DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the described embodiments of the application and uses of the described embodiments. As used herein, the word “exemplary” or “illustrative” means “serving as an example, instance, or illustration.” Any implementation described herein as “exemplary” or “illustrative” is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations. All of the implementations described below are exemplary implementations provided to enable persons skilled in the art to practice the disclosure and are not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary or the following detailed description. As best illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 5, the accordion wallet with electromagnetic shielding 100 (hereinafter invention) is further comprised of a first member 101 and a second member 102 that collectively form an outer case that encloses an interior compartment 103 formed therein. The first member 101 and the second member 102 connect together via a hinge member 110 such that the first member 101 rotates towards and from the second member 102. It shall be noted that the hinge member 110 may be made of a plastic, metal, wood, carbon fiber composite. The first member 101 includes a slide latch 120 on a first distal edge 121 of the first member 101. The slide latch 120 engages a clip member 122 located on a second distal edge 123 of the second member 102. Both the first member 101 and the second member 102 include webbing members 130 on opposing sides of the first member 101 and the second member 102. The webbing member 130 is an expandable object that includes multiple folds 131 that enable the webbing member 130 to fold compactly or to unfold. The webbing member 130 is further defined with a webbing length 132 that is less than a side length 133 of either the first member 101 or the second member 102. The first member 101 and the second member 102 are each further defined with a lip protuberance 140 that extends along three of the four sides, and with the exception of the side adjacent the hinge member 110. The lip protuberance 140 includes the first distal edge 121 and the second distal edge 123. The webbing members 130 are attached to the first member 101 and the second member 102 within the lip protuberance 140. The first member 101 and the second member 102 may include leather exteriors 180 that cover an outer surface of the respective members. The first member 101 and the second member 102 may be made of a flexible material so as to adjust and contour to the conditions presented thereto. For example, if the invention 100 is placed in a closed state into a back pocket of a pair of pants, and an end user sits thereon, the first member 101 and the second member 102 are able to contour to the weight presented thereto. The invention 100 also includes a plurality of copper sleeves 150 that are hingedly affixed to the hinge member 110 and reside within the first member 101 and the second member 102. The copper sleeves 150 each include a hinge armature 151 that is located on an inner sleeve edge 152, and which connects to the hinge member 110 such that the copper sleeves 150 individual rotate with respect to the hinge member 110. Referring to FIG. 5, the copper sleeves 150 are each further defined with a waterproof membrane 155 that encircles the copper sleeve 150. The copper sleeve 150 includes a credit card slot 156 that is configured to enable a credit card 170 to be inserted and removed from the copper sleeve 150. It shall be noted that the copper sleeve 150 is configured to store the credit card 170 therein, and to protect the magnetic strip located on the credit card 170 from damage associated with an electromagnetic pulse. With respect to the above description, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationship for the various components of the invention 100, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function, and the manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the invention 100. It shall be noted that those skilled in the art will readily recognize numerous adaptations and modifications which can be made to the various embodiments of the present invention which will result in an improved invention, yet all of which will fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined in the following claims. Accordingly, the invention is to be limited only by the scope of the following claims and their equivalents. 1.
