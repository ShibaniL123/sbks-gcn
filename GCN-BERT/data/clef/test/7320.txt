CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This is a U.S. national stage application of the International Patent Application No. PCT/CN2012/001545, filed Nov. 14, 2012, which claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 201110359739.8, filed Nov. 14, 2011, both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. FIELD OF THE INVENTION Provided herein are novel aminoquinazoline derivatives and their salts that are useful in treatment of hyperproliferative diseases, such as cancers, in mammals. In particular, this invention relates to the compounds that inhibit the activity of protein tyrosine kinase, resulting in the inhibition of intra- or inter-cellular signaling. Provided also herein are methods of using compounds or pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases in mammals, especially those of humans. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Protein kinases represent a large family of proteins, which play an important role in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes, maintaining control over cellular functions. Protein tyrosine kinases may be classified as growth factor receptor (e.g. VEGFR, EGFR, PDGFR, FGFR and erbB2) or non-receptor (e.g. c-src and bcr-abl) kinases. The receptor type tyrosine kinases make up about 20 different subfamilies. The non-receptor type tyrosine kinases make up numerous subfamilies. Receptor tyrosine kinases are large enzymes that span the cell membrane and possess an extracellular binding domain for growth factors, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular portion that functions as a kinase to phosphorylate a specific tyrosine residue in proteins and hence to influence cell proliferation. Aberrant or inappropriate protein kinase activity can contribute to the rise of disease states associated with such aberrant kinase activity. A partial list of such kinases include abl, AATK, ALK, Akt, axl, bmx, bcr-abl, Blk, Brk, Btk, csk, c-kit, c-Met, c-src, c-fins, CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6, CDK7, CDK8, CDK9, CDK10, cRaf1, CSF1R, CSK, DDR1, DDR2, EPHA, EPHB, EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, Erk, Fak, fes, FER, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFR5, Fgr, flt-1, Fps, Frk, Fyn, GSG2, GSK, Hck, ILK, INSRR, IRAK4, ITK, IGF-1R, INS-R, Jak, KSR1, KDR, LMTK2, LMTK3, LTK, Lck, Lyn, MATK, MERTK, MLTK, MST1R, MUSK, NPR1, NTRK, MEK, PLK4, PTK, p38, PDGFR, PIK, PKC, PYK2, RET, ROR1, ROR2, RYK, ros, Ron, SGK493, SRC, SRMS, STYK1, SYK, TEC, TEK, TEX14, TNK1, TNK2, TNNI3K, TXK, TYK2, TYRO3, tie, tie2, TRK, Yes, and Zap70. Inhibition of such kinases has become an important therapeutic target. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a kind of receptor tyrosine kinases, is over expressed and/or mutated in most tumors. It can control the tumor growth by signal transduction and is closely related to the angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis of tumor. EGFR is an important regulatory factor in cell growth, differentiation and survival, members of which include erbB-1 (EGFR, HER1), erbB-2 (EGFR, HER2), erbB-3 (EGFR, HER3) and erbB-4 (EGFR, HER4), and they have similar structure consisting of extracellular receptor ligand domain, single-strand transmembrane domain and highly conserved protein tyrosine kinase domain, with the function of the receptor as well as the ability of converting extracellular signal into intracellular effect directly as a novel transmembrane transit mode. Once combined with specific ligand, EGFR is activated by autophosphorylation of relative tyrosine kinase, resulting in activation of intracellular signal transduction pathways. These pathways of signal transduction include: activation of Ras protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase leads to activation of multiple proteins in the nucleus involving cyclin D1, thereby leading to DNA synthesis, cell growth and differentiation. Excessive activation of the growth factor receptors makes cell proliferation out of control, therefore, induces various types of excess proliferative diseases, such as non-small cell lung cancer, cancer of breast and head, etc. Since inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases has been proved to be of value in regulating cell replication out of control, it becomes the therapeutic target for novel antitumor drugs.

It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds disclosed herein, including but not limited to, diastereomers, enantiomers and atropisomers, as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L, or R and S, are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (−) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (−) or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms “racemic mixture” and “racemate” refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.

A “solvate” refers to an association or complex of one or more solvent molecules and a compound disclosed herein. Examples of solvents that form solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. The term “hydrate” refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water. The term “protecting group” or “Pg” refers to a substituent that is commonly employed to block or protect a particular functionality while reacting with other functional groups on the compound. For example, an “amino-protecting group” is a substituent attached to an amino group that blocks or protects the amino functionality in the compound. Some non-limiting examples of suitable amino-protecting groups include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and 9-fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl (Fmoc).

In Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st edition, 2005, ed. D. B. Troy, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, and Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, eds. J. Swarbrick and J. C. Boylan, 1988-1999, Marcel Dekker, New York, the contents of each of which is incorporated by reference herein, are disclosed various carriers used in formulating pharmaceutically acceptable compositions and known techniques for the preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the compounds disclosed herein, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other component(s) of the pharmaceutically acceptable composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this invention. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, or potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, wool fat, sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants. The compositions disclosed herein may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The term “parenteral” as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intraocular, intrahepatic, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered orally, intraperitoneally or intravenously. Sterile injectable forms of the compositions disclosed herein include aqueous or oleaginous suspension. These suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that include water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil includes synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents that are commonly used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of formulation. The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions disclosed herein include orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch. When aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or coloring agents may also be added. Alternatively, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions disclosed herein include administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These can be prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-irrigating excipient that is solid at room temperature but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols. The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions disclosed herein also include administered topically, especially when the target of treatment includes areas or organs readily accessible by topical application, including diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily prepared for each of these areas or organs. Topical application for the lower intestinal tract can be effected in a rectal suppository formulation (see above) or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches may also be used. For topical applications, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment containing the active component suspended or dissolved in one or more carriers. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or cream containing the active components suspended or dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, Span 60 (sorbitan monostearate), Tween 60 (polysorbate 60), cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water. For ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be formulated, e.g., as micronized suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline or other aqueous solution, or in other embodiments, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline or other aqueous solution, either with or without a preservative such as benzalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic uses, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum. The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions disclosed herein may also be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters, fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents to enhance bioavailability. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, 2-tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injections or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables. The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium prior to use. In order to prolong the effect of a compound disclosed herein, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle accomplishes delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Some non-limiting examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly (orthoesters) and poly (anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues. Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds disclosed herein with suitable non-irrigating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or calcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid; b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia; c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; f) absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay; and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such as magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain pacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or in other embodiments, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Some non-limiting examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound disclosed herein include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required.

The typical incubation mixtures consisted of human liver microsomes (0.75 mg protein/mL), compounds of interest (1.5 μM) and NADPH (6.0 mM) in total volume of 200 μL potassium phosphate buffer (PBS, 100 mM, pH7.4). Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with PBS such that the final concentration of DMSO was 0.05%. The enzymatic reactions were commenced with the addition of protein after a 10-min preincubation and incubated in a water bath open to the air at 37° C. Reactions were terminated at various time points (0, 15 and 30 min) by adding equal volume of ice-cold acetonitrile. The samples were stored at −80° C. until LC/MS/MS assays. The concentrations of compounds in the incubation mixtures of human live microsomes were determined by a LC/MS/MS method. A parallel incubation was performed using denatured microsomes as the negative control, and reactions were terminated at various time points (0, 15 and 30 min) after incubation at 37° C. Ketanserin (1.5 μM) was selected as the positive control, and reaction were terminated at various time points (0, 15 and 30 min) after incubation at 37° C. Both positive and negative control sample were included in each assay to ensure the integrity of the microsomal incubation system.
