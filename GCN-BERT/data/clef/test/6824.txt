Priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(a) and 35 U.S.C. §365(b) is claimed from IN Patent Application No. 3590/CHE/2010, filed 29 Nov. 2010, the disclosure of which is also incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a commercially viable process for preparing pazopanib and its pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof in high yields using novel intermediate. The present invention also provides a process for the purification of pazopanib hydrochloride. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION U.S. Pat. No. 7,105,530 disclosed pyrimidineamines and their derivatives thereof. These compounds are antineoplastic agents, and are useful in the treatment of various cancers and renal cell carcinoma. Among them pazopanib hydrochloride, chemically 5-[4-[N-(2,3-Dimethyl-2H-indazol-6-yl)-N-methylamino]pyrimidin-2-ylamino]-2-methylbenzenesulfonamide hydrochloride. Pazopanib hydrochloride is represented by the following structure: Pazopanib hydrochloride is a potent and selective multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR (Vascular endothelial growth factor receptors)-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR (Platelet-derived growth factor receptors)-α/β, and c-kit that blocks tumor growth and inhibits angiogenesis. It has been approved for renal cell carcinoma by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Pazopanib hydrochloride may also be active in ovarian cancer and soft tissue sarcoma. Pazopanib hydrochloride also appears effective in the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma. Pazopanib hydrochloride is marketed under the brand name Votrient® by Glaxosmithkline in the form of tablet. Processes for the preparation of pazopanib hydrochloride and related compounds were disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,105,530 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,262,203. According to U.S. Pat. No. 7,105,530, pazopanib hydrochloride can be prepared by reacting the N-(2-chloropyrimidin-4-yl)-N,2,3-trimethyl-2H-indazol-6-amine with 5-amino-2-methylbenzenesulfonamide in the presence of hydrochloric acid in isopropanol and ether. U.S. patent application publication no. 2006/0252943 disclosed a process for the preparation of pazopanib hydrochloride. According to this patent, pazopanib hydrochloride can be prepared by reacting the N-(2-chloropyrimidin-4-yl)-N,2,3-trimethyl-2H-indazol-6-amine with 5-amino-2-methylbenzenesulfonamide in the presence of hydrochloric acid in ethanol or methanol or tetrahydrofuran or acetonitrile and dioxane.
