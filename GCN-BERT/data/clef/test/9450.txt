Preferably, as in the exemplified embodiment, upper section 114 is an integrally formed plate, and lower section 116 is an integrally formed plate. The front portion 118 of the upper section 114 extends forwardly of the lower section 116 and has a length “L” as exemplified in FIGS. 2 and 3. Preferably, front portion defines a lower open sided air flow chamber. As exemplified, at front portion 118 of the upper section 114, the outer surface 115 has an upward facing portion 159, and a downward facing portion 161 and has a thickness “T” that is less than length “L”. The downward facing portion 161 forms a front portion 120 of bottom surface 112. Further the outer surface 117 of the lower section 116 forms a rear portion 121 of the bottom surface 112. Preferably, the front portion 118 of the upper section 114 comprises a single layer of material. For example, the front portion 118 of the upper section 114 may comprise a single layer of plastic. In some embodiments, the plastic may have a thickness less than 0.1 inches. In the exemplified embodiment, reinforcing ribs 179 are provided on the upward facing portion 159 of the outer surface 115 of upper section 114. The reinforcing ribs 179 may prevent front portion 118 from breaking or deflecting when surface cleaning head 100 is in use, for example if front portion 118 hits a wall. In the embodiment shown, a first set of reinforcing ribs 177 is provided adjacent the first lateral side 106, and a second set 175 of reinforcing ribs is provided adjacent the second lateral side 108. Preferably, the reinforcing ribs are integrally molded with upper section 114 The reinforcing ribs 179 extend upwardly and rearwardly from the front end 102, and increase in height going rearwardly. The ribs 179 merge with a rear portion 147 of the upper section 114, which is at a higher height than the front portion. Accordingly, in the exemplified embodiment, the ribs are at a transition portion 151 of the upper section 114. In the exemplified embodiment, the outer surface 115 of the upper section 114, and the outer surface 117 of the lower section 116 comprise essentially all of the outer surface of the surface cleaning head. That is, the outer surface 115 of the upper section 114, and the outer surface 117 of the lower section 116 comprise all of the outer surface of the surface cleaning head, excluding an optional pivot mount cover 193, as will be described hereinbelow. In alternate embodiments, other sections (e.g. other plates) may be provided, which may form portions of the outer surface of the surface cleaning head 100. Preferably, at least a section of the front portion 118 is transparent. For example, the transparent section may be fabricated from a transparent plastic, such as polycarbonate. More preferably, all of the front portion 118 is transparent. For example, in the exemplified embodiment, all of upper section 114 is transparent, including all of front portion 118. Preferably, the lower section 116 is opaque. It will be appreciated that upper section 114 may be tinted. The surface cleaning apparatus comprises an airflow passage extending from a dirty air inlet 130 to an air outlet 134. Preferably, at least a portion of the airflow passage extends under the section of the front portion 118 that is transparent. More preferably, the airflow passage comprises at least a section that has an open lower side. For example, as shown, the dirty air inlet 130 is provided at front end 102. A first airflow chamber 128 extends rearwardly from dirty air inlet 130. In the exemplified embodiment, the airflow chamber 128 is integrally formed in front portion 118 of upper section 114. More particularly, the outer surface 115 of the upper section is contoured to form a top wall 190, and opposed side walls 192, 194, of the airflow chamber 128. Accordingly, the airflow chamber 128 extends under front portion 118, and as all of front portion 118 is transparent, the airflow chamber 128 provides the portion of the airflow passage that extends under the transparent section of front portion 118. In the exemplified embodiment, all of the lower side 188 of the airflow chamber, which extends between the air inlet 130, the rear 132, and the sides 192, 194, is open. In alternate embodiments, only a portion may be open. Any lower open sided construction may be used. An advantage of using an integrally formed upper section 114 is that front portion 118 may be transparent and may have sufficient strength to permit the front of the cleaning head to comprise a single layer of plastic. If an open sided air flow chamber is provided below front portion 118, which is preferred, then a user may view the air channel and determine if a blockage occurs. An advantage of the transition region is that reinforcing ribs may be provided to provide rigidity to front portion 118. During use, front portion 118 may vibrate or flex, particularly at high suction. The may affect the efficiency of the vacuum cleaner due to variations in air flow rate in the lower open sided air flow chamber. Rear end 132 of airflow chamber 128 may be in communication with a manifold 198, which is in communication with an enclosed passage 140 via an enclosed passage inlet 136. The enclosed passage 140 extends rearwardly from the enclosed passage inlet 136. A swivel joint 137 is mounted to a rear end of the enclosed passage 140, and is in airflow communication with the enclosed passage 140. The swivel joint is mountable in airflow communication with the surface cleaning apparatus 600, and comprises the air outlet 134 of the surface cleaning head 100. Any other connection known in the vacuum cleaner arts may be used. Preferably, as in the exemplified embodiment, the surface cleaning apparatus further comprises a second airflow chamber 122, and a third airflow chamber 123, which form a portion of the airflow passage. The second airflow chamber has an inlet 124 at first lateral side 106, and an outlet 126 in communication with manifold 198. The third airflow chamber 123 has an inlet 125 at second lateral side 108, and an outlet 127 in communication with manifold 198. Inlets 124 and 125 form auxiliary dirty air inlets to surface cleaning head 100. Both the second 122 and third 123 airflow chambers are preferably integrally formed in front portion 118 of upper section 114. For example, the outer surface 115 of the upper section 114 may be contoured to form a top wall 133, and opposed side walls 135, 139 of the second airflow chamber 122, and to form a top wall 141 and opposed side walls 143, 145 of the third airflow chamber 123. In the exemplified embodiment, the second airflow chamber 122 has an open lower side 129, and the third airflow chamber 123 has an open lower side 131. In another embodiment, inlets 124, 125 may not be provided. The surface cleaning head 100 is preferably configured to transition from a low pile carpet to a high pile carpet. This design may be used by itself or with any other feature disclosed herein. For example, as shown, the front portion 118 of top section 114 comprises an upwardly curved lip 199. Lip 199 is provided at the front 102 of the surface cleaning head 100, above dirty air inlet 130. Accordingly, if surface cleaning head 100 is pushed from a low pile carpet to a high pile carpet, lip 199 will serve as a ramp, and aid in lifting the surface cleaning head 100 from the low pile carpet onto the high pile carpet. In some embodiments, the sidewalls 192, 194 of the first airflow passage are formed from triangular members 167 and 169. The triangular members 167, 169 may curve upwardly together with lip 199 at front end 102. This is shown in FIG. 7. The front or leading edge of any side wall for the open lower sided air flow channel may be chamfered, curved or radiused. In some embodiments, ribs that act as carpet holders may be provided, which, in use, hold down a carpet, and prevent the carpet from being lifted upward off of a surface by the flow of air through the open sided airflow passages 128, 122, 123. This design may be used by itself with an lower open sided air flow chamber or with any other feature disclosed herein. For example, as shown in FIG. 8, two carpet holders 195 are provided, which extend downwardly from top wall 190 of first passage 128 and preferably extend in a direction of flow. Referring to FIGS. 2 to 5, the surface cleaning head 100 preferably comprises at least front wheels.

Accordingly, the first front wheel 150 is rotatable about a horizontal axis H1 defined by first axle 158. The second front wheel assembly 144 further comprises a second bracket 160, having outwardly extending arms 162a, 162b. The second front wheel 152 is mounted on a second axle 164 which extends horizontally between the arms 162a, 162b. Accordingly, the second front wheel 152 is rotatable about a horizontal axis H2 defined by axle 164. As exemplified, the first bracket 154 comprises a first vertically extending portion 166 provided above the outwardly extending arms 156, and the second bracket 160 comprises a second vertically extending portion 168 provided above the outwardly extending arms 162. First 170 and second 172 vertical pins are mounted to the lower section 116, and extend downwardly therefrom. The first vertically extending portion 166 is rotatably received on the first pin 170, and the second vertically extending portion 168 is rotatably received on the second pin 172. Accordingly, the first 154 and second 160 brackets are rotatable about first and second vertical pins 170 and 172, respectively, to rotate first 142 and second 144 front wheel assemblies about vertical axes V1 and V2, respectively. Preferably, as shown in FIG. 4, the horizontal axis of rotation H1 of the first front wheel 150 is spaced from the vertical axis of rotation V1 of the first front wheel assembly 142, and the horizontal axis of rotation H2 of the second front wheel 152 is spaced from the vertical axis of rotation V1 of the first front wheel assembly 144. For example, as exemplified, outwardly extending arms 156a, 156b extend laterally away from vertically extending portion 166, such that axle 158, which defines axis H1, is spaced from vertically extending portion 166, which defines axis V1. Similarly, outwardly extending arms 162a, 162b extend laterally away from vertically extending portion 168, such that axle 164, which defines axis H2, is spaced from vertically extending portion 168, which defines axis V2. Preferably, as shown in FIG. 4, the rear wheels 146, 148 are rotatable about horizontal axes H3. For example, as shown in FIG. 5, the rear wheels 146, 148 are mounted on axles 174 and 176, respectively, which are fixedly mounted on opposed sides of enclosed passage 140, adjacent rear end 104. Preferably, as exemplified the front wheels are positioned rearwardly of the enclosed passage inlet 136.
