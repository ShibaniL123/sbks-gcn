Step 2
3-Ethyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (35)
To a solution of 3-ethyl-4-(methoxymethoxy)benzaldehyde (600 mg, 3.07 mmol) in MeOH (10 mL) at room temperature, 6N HCl (3 mL) was added slowly. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 (100 mL), washed with water (20 mLÃ—2), brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated to provide the crude product, which was then purified on a silica gel column, eluting with ethyl acetate in pet ether (20:80) to get 3-ethyl-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde as a colorless liquid (440 mg, yield=96%),
