Step 2: preparation of intermediate tert-butyl 3-bromo-5-oxazol-2-yl-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylate (7b)
Thionyl bromide (32 µL, 0.41 mmol) was dropwise added to a solution of TEA (58 µL, 0.41 mmol) and tert-butyl 3-hydroxy-3-oxazol-2-yl-2,6-dihydropyridine-1-carboxylate (7a) (100 mg, 0.38 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (1.38 mL) at 0°C. The mixture was stirred at 0°C for 50 min then poured in a mixture of ice and H2O. The layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with DCM. The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo to provide tert-butyl 3-bromo-5-oxazol-2-yl-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylate (7b) (124 mg, 0.38 mmol, 99%) as a brown oil which was used without further purification.
