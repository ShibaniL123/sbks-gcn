BACKGROUND 1. Field The present disclosure relates to a method of preparing a base sequence of 5′-cohesive end of a linear nucleic acid for synthesizing a Y-shaped nucleic acid nanostructure, and a method of synthesizing a dendrimer-like (branched) nucleic acid nanostructure using the Y-shaped nucleic acid nanostructure including the base sequence of cohesive end at the 5′ terminus prepared by the method. 2. Description of Related Art With the development of nucleic acid structural engineering, a variety of nucleic acid nanostructures have been designed and constructed. Spherical, dendrimer-like, rod-like, box-like, and even emoticon-like nucleic acid structures have been developed in addition to the conventional linear and circular natural nucleic acid structures. T4 ligation enzymes have been widely used to construct new structures in addition to the natural nucleic acid structures. However, the use of the T4 ligation enzymes causes many problems regarding cohesive end ligation methods. For example, the product yield is low when T4 ligation enzymes are used, and the probability of errors in an expected target to be synthesized increases when ligations are performed using different 5′-cohesive ends. For instance, it is difficult to synthesize a precise structure due to occurrence of mismatch ligations. In addition, when the synthesized nanostructure is used in vivo, severe side effects make it difficult to expect accurate results. Accordingly, when a nucleic acid nanostructure is synthesized using a T4 ligation enzyme, it is necessary to verify a design of an additional base sequence of 5′-cohesive end and improve a ligation method so as to obtain a precise nucleic acid nanostructure.

According to still another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of synthesizing a dendrimer-like nucleic acid nanostructure using linear nucleic acids including the base sequence of 5′-cohesive end prepared by the method. According to one example of the present disclosure, the synthesis may be performed in a ligation buffer comprising a ligation enzyme, and a salt. According to another example of the present disclosure, the synthesis may be performed at a low temperature of 3 to 7° C., room temperature of 16 to 25° C., or a high temperature of 30 to 37° C. According to still another example of the present disclosure, the ligation enzyme may be selected from the group consisting of a T4 ligation enzyme, a Thermus thermophilus ligation enzyme, a mammalian DNA ligation enzyme I, a mammalian DNA ligation enzyme II, and a Vaccinia virus DNA ligation enzyme. According to still another example of the present disclosure, the ligation buffer may be under a salt condition in which the salt is present in a concentration of 150 to 200 mM. According to still another example of the present disclosure, the salt may be NaCl. According to still another example of the present disclosure, the synthesis may be performed at 30 to 37° C. in the ligation buffer having a low salt concentration. According to yet another example of the present disclosure, the low salt concentration may be a salt condition in which the salt is present in a concentration of 1 to 50 mM. According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a dendrimer-like nucleic acid nanostructure synthesized by the method. Here, the dendrimer-like nucleic acid nanostructure has an increased synthetic yield and a reduced probability of producing a mismatch ligation product. The present inventors have conducted ardent research to develop a method of reducing mismatch ligations and enhancing the synthetic yield upon synthesis of dendrimer-like nucleic acid structures or X- and T-shaped nucleic acid nanostructures using nucleic acid nanostructures, and to establish an efficient method of preparing a base sequence of 5′-cohesive end of the nucleic acid nanostructure. Accordingly, the present disclosure may provide a method of preparing a base sequence of 5′-cohesive end of linear nucleic acids to enhance the synthetic yield of a nucleic acid nanostructure, including following steps: (a) selecting candidate groups of base sequences of 5′-cohesive end having guanine (G)-cytosine (C) content of 50 to 60%; (b) calculating Gibb's free energy values of the selected candidate groups of step (a) to select candidates having maximum, median and minimum values, and performing ligation experiments on the candidates; (c) re-selecting the candidate groups having an approximation to the Gibb's free energy values of the candidates which are the most readily ligated based on the experimental results of step (b); and(d) selecting the candidate groups that have a sequence of 3 to 5 different successive bases among the base sequences from the re-selected candidate groups. The method according to one example of the present disclosure may be used to enhance the yield with which linear nucleic acids including a base sequence of 5′-cohesive end are ligated to synthesize a nucleic acid nanostructure, thereby reducing a probability of producing a mismatch ligation product when the linear nucleic acids are synthesized into a dendrimer-like, X-shaped, or T-shaped nucleic acid nanostructure. In this regard, the nucleic acid nanostructure having a base sequence of 5′-cohesive end was ligated into a dendrimer-like shape using a T4 ligation enzyme according to one example of the present disclosure. As a result, it was confirmed that the yield of the dendrimer-like nucleic acid nanostructure is different by up to 20 to 25% or more according to the thermodynamic characteristics of the base sequence of 5′-cohesive end. Therefore, the present inventors have provided a theoretical calculation method for finding thermodynamic information on nucleic acid nanostructures having a base sequence of 5′-cohesive end, and found that the expectable high-yield base sequences of 5′-cohesive end of the nucleic acid nanostructures identified by means of the theoretical calculation method have a high synthetic yield at certain Gibb's free energy, and the base sequence of 5′-cohesive end having four bases has an especially high synthetic yield in a Gibb's free energy range of −4.52±0.5 kcal/mol. Also, according to one example of the present disclosure, new criteria for selecting a candidate group consisting of base sequences of 5′-cohesive end to synthesize an inexpensive high-purity, high-yield nucleic acid nanostructure, arrangement conditions for base sequences, and 5′-cohesive end having a certain Gibb's free energy value according to the criteria and arrangement conditions are provided. In this case, the base sequence of 5′-cohesive end is designed so that the candidate group has GC content of 50% or more so as to unify the conditions associated with the spiral structure (shape) and stability of the nucleic acid nanostructure. Also, the thermodynamic information on the base sequences of 5′-cohesive end which are readily ligated, as experimentally obtained through calculation of the Gibb's free energy values, is calculated to newly re-select the candidate groups satisfying the requirements with which the base sequences of 5′-cohesive end are readily ligated experimentally. To reduce a probability of occurrence of errors in the re-selected candidate groups, three or more successive bases should not be the same in the base sequences of the newly re-selected candidate groups. According to one example of the present disclosure, it is also confirmed that the candidate groups may be derived by the method as described above using base sequences other than the base sequences having a high Gibb's free energy value, such as CG, GC and GG, to obtain the candidate groups having a Gibb's free energy value, which are readily ligated, in the case of the 5′-cohesive ends consisting of four bases. That is, a method of deriving a thermodynamic and structural candidate group for base sequences of 5′-cohesive end consisting of four bases is schematically shown in the flow chart of FIG. 3. Therefore, in the method according to one example of the present disclosure, steps (b) and (c) may be steps of finding candidates of the base sequence of 5′-cohesive end which are the most readily ligated by means of the experiments, calculating Gibb's free energy values of the candidates and re-selecting the candidate groups having an approximation to the Gibb's free energy values of the candidates. When the number of bases of 5′-cohesive end is 4, the approximation may be preferably in a range of ±0.5 kcal/mol. However, a preferred range of the Gibb's free energy value is deduced from the candidate groups having a base sequence consisting of four bases. In this case, it is apparent to those skilled in the related art that the candidate groups may be deduced by applying the method according to one example of the present disclosure to construction of the base sequences of 5′-cohesive end of the nucleic acid nanostructures consisting of four or more bases in the same manner, and thus the preferred range of the Gibb's free energy value may be set through calculations conducted by those skilled in the related art, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. However, when the number of bases exceeds 6, the candidate groups may increase exponentially. Therefore, when the candidate groups are established using a group of the base sequences consisting of 4 to 6 bases, only the method according to one example of the present disclosure may be used to deduce the high-yield candidate groups exactly. Accordingly, the method of synthesizing a nucleic acid nanostructure with high purity and high yield according to one example of the present disclosure (a theoretical calculation method) may be applied to nucleic acid nanostructures as long as the nucleic acid nanostructures have a base sequence of 5′-cohesive end. In this case, the method may be used to obtain the nucleic acid nanostructure with a high yield of at least 90% or more. Also, the present disclosure may provide a method of synthesizing a dendrimer-like, X-shaped or T-shaped nucleic acid nanostructure using the linear nucleic acids including a base sequence of 5′-cohesive end finally selected in the preparation method, and a candidate group for base sequences of 5′-cohesive end of linear nucleic acids in which number of bases used to enhance the synthetic yield of the nucleic acid nanostructure finally selected in the preparation method is 4. According to one example of the present disclosure, the candidate group may preferably consist of at least one selected from the group consisting of GAGT, GACT, GTCT, GTGT, GAGA, CTCT, GACA, GTGA, GTCA, CACT, CTGT, CAGT, CTAG, GATC, GTTC, CATC, and GATG. The candidate groups include some of the candidate groups identified according to the experiments conducted to prove the accuracy of the preparation method according to one example of the present disclosure. Therefore, it is apparent that the base sequences of 5′-cohesive end which may be deduced by the preparation method according to one example of the present disclosure may be included in the candidate groups without limitation as long as the mismatch ligation of the base sequences of 5′-cohesive end can be minimized and the base sequences of 5′-cohesive end can be ligated with high yield. In the present disclosure, experimental information on the probability of mismatch ligation, that is, hybridization between non-complementary base sequences of 5′-cohesive end, and structural hybridization information on the non-complementary base sequences of 5′-cohesive end were presented, and the candidate groups on which mismatch ligations can or cannot be performed were deduced based on the presented information. As a result, it was found that errors may be minimized through the control of the temperature, compared to the candidate groups. The present inventors determined a synthesis temperature at which it is possible to reduce a probability of mismatch ligations, and also determined the conditions at which errors may be reduced under other salt-concentration conditions, based on previous reports showing that a probability of occurrence of mismatch ligations is reduced under a condition of a ligation buffer having a salt concentration of at least 150 to 200 mM. The synthesis may be performed in a ligation buffer including a ligation enzyme, and a salt. According to one example of the present disclosure, it was confirmed that the ligation is performed in the ligation buffer including the ligation enzyme and the salt, and is preferably performed under the ligation temperature conditions including a low temperature of 3 to 7° C., room temperature of 16 to 25° C., or a high temperature of 30 to 37° C. Also, it was confirmed that, when a dendrimer-like DNA nanostructure is synthesized at 30 to 37° C. under a low-salt condition in which the salt is present at a concentration of 1 to 50 mM in the ligation buffer, the dendrimer-like DNA nanostructure may be synthesized with high yield while minimizing a probability of mismatch ligations. The ligation enzyme may be selected from the group consisting of a T4 ligation enzyme, a T. thermophilus ligation enzyme, a mammalian DNA ligation enzyme I, a mammalian DNA ligation enzyme II, and a Vaccinia virus DNA ligation enzyme, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. For example, since the ligation probability varies according to the ligation enzyme, a ligation enzyme suitable for experimental conditions may be used in consideration of these facts. Preferred ligation methods for nucleic acid nanostructure-based ligation according to one example of the present disclosure vary according to the thermodynamic state and hybridization structure of cohesive ends, the probability of errors between candidate groups, the synthesis temperature, and the salt concentration, but these parameters may be properly adjusted within a range signified by the theoretical method according to one example of the present disclosure by those skilled in the related art. Based on the foregoing, the present disclosure may provide a dendrimer-like nucleic acid nanostructure synthesized by the method, characterized in that the nucleic acid nanostructure has an increased synthetic yield and a reduced probability of producing a mismatch ligation product. Hereinafter, various embodiments are provided to aid in understanding the present disclosure. However, it should be understood that detailed description provided herein is merely intended to provide a better understanding of the present disclosure, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.

The base sequence and schematic diagram of the synthesized structure according to Example 1 are shown in FIG. 1. Example 2 Determination of Problems with Base Sequences of 5′-Cohesive End and Fluorescent Material for Early Hypothesis Experiment Electrophoresis was performed on the dendrimer-like nucleic acid structure synthesized in Example 1 using the characteristics of a fluorescent material, fluorescein (FAM), which absorbed UV wavelengths to emit fluorescence. In this case, images obtained before and after staining agarose gel with EtBr were compared to determine problems with the cohesive ends of the left and right Y-shaped nucleic acid structures. In this example, it was confirmed that the right cohesive end was problematic. To solve this problem, two experiments were performed. First, the experiments were performed at different reaction ratios, which are one factor that is important for a chemical reaction. For this purpose, a ligation reaction was performed with an increasing amount of the reaction product of the right Y-shaped nanostructure, and the yields at the reaction ratio of 1:1:1, 1:1:1.2 or 1:1:1.4 for the body, left and right Y-shaped nanostructures were compared, but no increase in the yield was observed. Next, experiments were performed to determine an effect of concentrations of the Y-shaped nucleic acid nanostructure and the T4 ligation enzyme. For this purpose, an amount of the reaction product was reduced by half while maintaining the concentrations of the T4 ligation enzyme and a ligation buffer. However, no increase in the yield of the dendrimer-like nanostructure was observed. Example 3 Thermodynamic Calculation and Approach of Base Sequences of Cohesive 5′-End It was confirmed that there were the problems with the physicochemical characteristics of the base sequences of 5′-cohesive end in Example 2, and thus the thermodynamic characteristics of the base sequences of 5′-cohesive end were analyzed. As a result, it was revealed that the left base sequence of 5′-cohesive end had a Gibb's free energy value of −4.52 kcal/mol, and the right base sequence of 5′-ohesive end had a Gibb's free energy value of −6.57 kcal/mol. In this case, the thermodynamic information on the base sequences of 5′-cohesive end was deduced by applying the thermodynamic characteristics between the base sequences to the following Equation and calculating the thermodynamic characteristics (Δgi: Helix initiation free energy, and Δgsym: free energy of a self-complementary sequence or two complementary sequences). Next, the candidate groups were selected, and Gibb's free energy values (ΔGTotal) of the candidate groups were re-verified using an Oligo analyzer program from Integrated DNA Technologies. The ΔG° values of the two-successive base sequences are listed in the following Table 2 (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1986, 83, 3746-3750). [in-line-formulae]ΔGTotal=−(Δgi+Δgsym)+ΣxΔG° Equation:[/in-line-formulae] TABLE 2 Successive base ΔG° sequence (kcal/mol) AA/TT 1.9 AT/TA 1.5 TA/AT 0.9 CA/GT 1.9 GT/CA 1.3 CT/GA 1.6 GA/CT 1.6 CG/GC 3.6 GC/CG 3.1 GG/CC 3.1 Nearest-neighbor thermodynamics. 1 M NaCl, 25° C., pH7 <3-1> Selection Requirements for Base Sequences of 5′-Cohesive End and Deduction of Candidate Groups The requirements used to deduce the base sequences of 5′-cohesive end were as described below. First, for consistency in a spiral structure of the nucleic acid nanostructure, nanostructures having guanine and cytosine content (GC content) of 50 to 60% were designed, and the cohesive ends and the structures themselves having a GC content of 50% were selected as a candidate group. This design requirement serves to restrict A-, B- and Z-type spiral structures of the hybridized DNA nanostructures to the B-type spiral structure. When adenine (A) and thymine (T) are successively arranged, the spiral structures have a probability of forming a Z-type DNA spiral structure due to structural external crushing conditions. Since a base sequence consisting of successive guanine bases forms a tertiary structure consisting of four strands referred to as a G quadruplex, this serves to reduce this probability. Therefore, when it is assumed that the content of the GC bases forming a DNA helix is defined to be maintained at 50 to 60%, the candidate groups of base sequences of 5′-cohesive end may be defined to be 24×6 (=96) rather than 44 (=256). Second, the Gibb's free energy values of the candidate groups selected thus were calculated to re-select the candidate groups which may be synthesized with high yield. In one example, the candidates having a certain Gibb's free energy value, which are readily ligated, were selected in advance through experiments. For example, the Gibb's free energy values of the cohesive ends consisting of four bases (the highest value to the lowest value for 256 cohesive ends) were in a range of −3.4 to −10.36 kcal/mole. In this example, when the candidate groups were selected according to the first requirement, the candidate groups (the highest value to the lowest value for 96 cohesive ends) had Gibb's free energy values ranging from −3.65 to −7.13 kcal/mole, as listed in the following Table 3. In this example, the criteria for deducing the certain Gibb's free energy values of the candidate groups which were readily ligated were based on the spiral shapes of the cohesive ends. When the Gibb's free energy had a negative (−) value (for example, −7.13 kcal/mole), this meant that the cohesive ends had a strong binding affinity, thereby making it possible to expect the spiral shapes of the cohesive ends to be relatively dense (due to strong biding). Also, when the Gibb's free energy had the smallest negative value (for example, −3.65 kcal/mole), this meant that the cohesive ends had a weak binding affinity, thereby making it possible to expect the spiral shapes of the cohesive ends to be relatively untangled (loose). Based on these criteria, it was experimentally judged which structure (shape) of the cohesive ends would cause the candidate groups to be more readily ligated.

Here, the criteria for stereochemical structures with specific spiral shapes were further provided, and included base arrangement and hydrogen bond order. This was derived from the fact that the spiral structures slightly varied according to the base arrangement (successive base components). As listed in the following Table 4, there were four hydrogen bond orders 3-3-2-2, 3-2-3-2, 3-2-2-3, and 2-3-3-2 in the case of a 5′-cohesive end consisting of four bases (since #4 and #5 were bound to #2 and #1, respectively, for the order of base bond number), and the nucleic acid nanostructures optionally had slightly different spiral structures.

A process of preferentially selecting candidates having a certain Gibb's free energy value, which were readily ligated, by the experiments was as described below. For example, in the case of the 5′-cohesive ends consisting of four bases, the candidates having a high energy value (approximately −7.0 kcal/mole, or greater than equal to −10.36 kcal/mole to less than or equal to −7.0 kcal/mole), a median energy value (approximately −5.5 kcal/mole, or more than −7.0 kcal/mole to less than or equal to −5.0 kcal/mole) and a low energy value (approximately −4.0 kcal/mole, or more than −5.0 to less than or equal to −3.0 kcal/mole) were able to be selected and compared, based on the Gibb's free energy. In this Example, candidate groups having a high energy value (5′-GCAA: −7.04 kcal/mole), a median energy value (5′-GCAT: −6.52 kcal/mole), and a low energy value (5′-GACT: −4.52 kcal/mole) were optionally selected, and the ligation yields of the candidate groups were compared. As a result, it was revealed that the candidates for the 5′-cohesive ends having a low energy value (4.52 kcal/mole) were obtained with the highest ligation yield. In the case of the 5′-cohesive ends consisting of four bases, the candidate groups were re-selected, as listed in the following Table 5, using another base arrangement in which another base was present between G and C other than base arrangement having a high energy value, such as CG, GC, and GG, so as to obtain the candidate groups having an energy value corresponding to approximately −4.52 kcal/mol±0.5 kcal/mol.

Considering this requirement, the candidate groups were able to be deduced from the flow chart illustrated in FIG. 2. In this case, the experiments were designed in a state in which a repeating sequence such as AGAG was removed as shown in the Venn diagram (repetitive sequence remove), before re-selecting the candidate groups reflecting the third requirement, in consideration of the fact that the repeating sequence had a probability of being present in an undesirable state as will be described below. However, the repeating sequence was considered to have no great influence on the ligation yield, and thus was excluded from the requirements. <Undesirable State Considered Upon Experiment Design> 5′ AGAG 3′ | | 5′ TCTC 3′ <3-2> Experiments for Determination of Ligation Yield of Candidate Groups The candidate groups satisfying the requirements of Example <3-1> were selected, and yield comparison experiments were performed on the candidate groups together with a conventional base sequence of 5′-cohesive end (5′-GCAT). The base sequences of the candidate groups and the thermodynamic information on the candidate groups are shown in FIG. 3. After a ligation reaction, the gel electrophoresis results showed that the yields of the base sequences of 5′-cohesive end were different according to the Gibb's free energy. The gel electrophoresis results are shown in the graph and table of FIG. 4. As shown in FIG. 4, it was revealed that the yield of the conventional 5′-GCAT was 65%, and the yield of the newly substituted cohesive end base sequence increased to 83 to 90%. To summarize the experimental results, it was first revealed that the base sequences of 5′-cohesive end having a certain thermodynamic energy range had a high synthetic yield by the ligation, and second that the base sequence of 5′-cohesive end having the same Gibb's free energy value also had slightly different yields. The results were confirmed to be due to a difference in the stereochemical spiral structures of the base sequences of 5′-cohesive end. Also, to summarize the complementary sequences in the candidate groups listed in Table 5, the orders of hydrogen bond number, 3232 (12) and 3223 (5), were compressed into high-efficiency cohesive ends, as listed in the following Table 6. In this case, 5′ CTAG and 5′ GATC of 2. (1) and (2) were used in consideration of the fact that 5′ CTAG and 5′ GATC had a probability of being self-hybridized.

First, the ligation yields were checked at 4° C. (at 0, 60, 120, 240, 320, and 1,380 minutes), and then the ligation yields were checked at 25° C. (at 0, 20, 40, 60, 120, 240, 320, and 1,380 minutes), and 37° C. (at 0, 20, 30, 40, 60, 120, 240, and 320 minutes) to compare the ligation yields according to the temperature. From the determined results of the ligation yields, it was revealed that the different base sequences of 5′-cohesive end had different ligation yields, but the same base sequences of 5′-cohesive end had no different ligation yields according to the temperature, as shown in FIG. 5. Example 5 Comparison and Analysis of Synthesis Yields of Dendrimer-Like Nucleic Acid Nanostructures Since the results showed that the ligation yield of the newly presented right cohesive end increased, experiments were performed to determine to which level the synthesis yields of the dendrimer-like nucleic acid nanostructures increased using the new base sequences of 5′-cohesive end. For this purpose, the left base sequence of 5′-cohesive end was fixed, and the right base sequence of 5′-cohesive end was replaced and ligated. As a result, it was revealed that the synthesis yields of the dendrimer-like nucleic acid nanostructures using the new base sequences of 5′-cohesive end increased by 10%, as shown in FIG. 6A. The total yield was calculated within an error bound by the following yield equation. [in-line-formulae]Total Yield Equation=(left ligation probability)×(right ligation probability)[/in-line-formulae] Example 6 Evaluation of Probability of Occurrence of Mismatch Ligations <6-1> Mismatch Ligation Occurrence Experiment and Deduction of Temperature at which Errors are Minimized Experiments were performed to determine a probability of forming mismatch ligations between the base sequences of 5′-cohesive end newly presented according to one example of the present disclosure. First, a theoretical approach for hybridization between non-complementary bases was performed. The probability of possible occurrence of mismatch ligations was able to be determined through the structural correlation between the cohesive ends and the probability of occurrence of mismatch ligations according to a ligation enzyme. In this case, the prior-art document discloses that the mismatch ligations may occur in the case of the T4 ligation enzyme, which is used at a low salt concentration (0 to 50 mM NaCl) at 30 to 37° C., when the cohesive end has a pair of A·C, T·T, T·G, T·C, G·T, C·A, C·T, or A·A (in this case, the pair of A·A was slowly ligated), and that the mismatch ligations are associated with a stereochemical portion when the cohesive end has a spiral structure, based on the results obtained by analyzing hydrogen bonds between bases and resonance structure (Nucleic Acids Research, 1985, 13, 4811-4824). Therefore, the structures in which the mismatch ligations did not occur easily in a structural aspect were predicted to be G·G, C·C, G·A, A·G, and A·A. However, according to one example of the present disclosure, since a mismatch base pair was not present at the end but present inside the base sequence, the mismatch base pair was predicted as a structure having a different influence on double helix structures than the ends. Therefore, the mismatch ligations were included in the possible candidate groups. For comparison, the left and right base sequences of 5′-cohesive end consisting of four bases were compared to determine the candidate groups including three Watson-Crick bonds and a pair of G·G, C·C, T·T, or A·A at the cohesive end. The results are shown in FIG. 7A. The four candidate groups were selected, and the mismatch ligations were confirmed in the candidate groups. As shown in FIG. 7A, it was revealed that both of the (respective) candidate groups having a high ligation yield in the right base sequences of 5′-cohesive end had one left base sequence of 5′-cohesive end, three Watson-Crick base pairs and one mismatch base pair. As a result, the presented candidate groups for the mismatch base pairs were G·G, C·C, T·T, and A·A. Among these, G·G and C·C were expected to be the structure having a low probability of occurrence of mismatch ligations, and T·T and A·A were expected to be the structure having a high probability of occurrence of mismatch ligations. In the case of the mismatch ligation, it was known that errors were able to be minimized according to the temperature and salt concentration, and the probability of occurrence of mismatch ligations according to the salt concentration was able to reduce errors under a condition of a solution including at least 150 to 200 mM NaCl. Therefore, the present inventors conducted experiments as another approach to determine whether it is possible to reduce the probability of occurrence of mismatch ligations when the salt concentration was fixed at a low salt condition in which NaCl was present at a concentration of 30 to 50 mM, and the ligation temperature was differently set to 25° C. and 37° C. As a result, it was revealed that the T·T and A·A mismatch ligation products were produced at a ligation temperature of 25° C., but no mismatch ligation products were produced at a ligation temperature of 37° C., as shown in FIG. 7B. Accordingly, it was theoretically and experimentally confirmed that, when there was the probability of occurrence of mismatch ligations, the probability of errors was able to be lowered by performing the synthesis at a temperature higher than room temperature or adjusting the salt concentration at a high level. <6-2> Deduction of Candidate Pair Groups for High-Efficiency Cohesive 5′-Ends Using Experiment for Probability of Occurrence of Mismatch Ligations From the results in Example <6-1>, it was confirmed that errors were able to occur when one identical base pair such as AA or TT which was ligated to be mismatched was present inside the four-base sequences of the cohesive end candidates to be used when the base sequence of 5′-cohesive end consisting of four bases were used. Therefore, a slightly more precise experiment was designed to perform re-experiments on mismatches A, B, C and D of the candidate groups as shown in FIG. 7A. In this example, the probability of occurrence of mismatch pair ligations in non-complementary portions in the presence of complementary cohesive ends was checked in Example <6-1> (that is, it was determined whether the cohesive ends were hybridized with non-complementary arms when the cohesive ends were present in both arms of the Y-shaped nucleic acid structure; it was also determined whether the mismatch pair ligations occurred in the presence of the complementary ends). In this Example, the probability of occurrence of mismatch pair ligations in the non-complementary portions was checked (that is, it was determined whether non-complementary hybridizations occurred when the cohesive end was present in one arm of the Y-shaped nucleic acid structure; it was also determined whether the mismatch pair ligations occurred in the absence of the complementary ends). For this purpose, the conditions in which only the mismatches A, B, C, and D were able to occur were formed, and the probability of occurrence of mismatch pair ligations according to the temperature (4, 25, and 37° C.) was checked. As a result, it was revealed that the mismatch pair ligations occurred in all the mismatches A, B, C, and D (CC, GG, AA, and TT) when the complementary cohesive ends were not present, as shown in FIG. 7C. Thus, it was revealed that the mismatch pair ligations often occurred in GG, AA and TT. Also, it was revealed that the mismatch pair ligations were reduced with an increasing temperature. Therefore, it was confirmed that, when the cohesive end candidates to be used had one different base pair which was not complementary inside the base sequence or was able to cause mismatch pair ligations in the base sequence, the mismatch pair ligations were able to occur. Example 7 Deduction of Candidate Pair Groups when Two or More of Cohesive 5′-End Candidates According to One Example of the Present Disclosure are Used From the results of Example 6, it could be seen that the mismatch pair ligations were possible when two or three bases in the base sequence of 5′-cohesive end consisting of four bases were arranged in such an order. In consideration of this, the candidate pair groups for cohesive ends capable of minimizing the mismatch pair ligations without any change in temperature or salt condition were deduced when two of the candidate groups listed in Table 6 were used (when only one cohesive end was used, it was possible to synthesize a nucleic acid structure using only one of the cohesive ends listed in Table 5). For this purpose, as listed in the following Table 7, first, the candidate groups in which 2 to 3 bases were arranged in the same positions in the cohesive ends listed in Table 6 were marked with “x.” Then, the candidate groups in which all the bases were arranged in different positions or one base was arranged in the same position were marked with “∘.” In summary, when two cohesive ends in the candidate groups for 5′-cohesive ends prepared according to one example of the present disclosure were used, the probability of errors was able to be minimized when the nucleic acid structures having various shapes were intended to be synthesized using the candidate pair groups marked with “o” as listed in the following Table 7, thereby making it possible to synthesize the nucleic acid structures with high efficiency without adjusting the salt and temperature conditions.

The candidate pair groups listed in the following Table 8 were deduced using the following sampling process: For example, when the candidate {circle around (3)} was used as a base sequence of 5′-cohesive end, the candidates {circle around (5)}, {circle around (7)}, {circle around (12)}, (4), and (5) in the row {circle around (3)} were usable; when the candidate {circle around (5)} was used as another base sequence of 5′-cohesive end among these candidates, the usable candidates were found in the column {circle around (5)}. In this case, only the candidates matching the candidate {circle around (3)} and the usable candidates {circle around (7)}, {circle around (12)}, (4), and (5) were selected. Therefore, one of the candidate pair groups {circle around (3)}-{circle around (5)}-{circle around (12)} and {circle around (3)}-{circle around (5)}-(4) was selected and used.

The present disclosure provides a method of selecting a candidate group for base sequences of 5′-cohesive end to construct a single dendrimer-like nucleic acid structure with low cost, high purity and high yield, and a new experimental and theoretical method of optimizing ligation conditions for reducing mismatch ligations, and thus can be useful in lowering costs by omitting a conventional step of further purifying a reaction product using methods such as HPLC, and maximizing the synthetic yield of the finally synthesized product.
