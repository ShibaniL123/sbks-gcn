FIELD OF INVENTION The present application relates to delivery particles comprising benefit agents, and products comprising such delivery particles, as well as processes for making and using such delivery particles and products comprising such delivery particles. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Products, for example, consumer products may comprise one or more benefit agents that can provide a desired benefit to such product and/or a situs that is contacted with such a product—for example stain removal and/or bleaching. Unfortunately, in certain products, for example, fluid products, benefit agents such as preformed peracids may be degraded by or degrade components of such products before such product is used—this is particularly true when the product has a pH greater than about 6. Thus, a protection system that protects the components of a product from a benefit agent is desired. Efforts have been made in this area but typically either fail to provide the required level of protection or fail to release the benefit agent when it is needed. Thus, the need for encapsulated benefit agents that are available during product use, yet which do not damage such product during product storage remains. Applicants disclose a delivery particle comprising a benefit agent, such as preformed peracids, wherein the benefit agent is in the form of cores, said cores being embedded in a matrix binder. Combined, the benefit agent cores and matrix binder form a matrix that is encapsulated by a shell. While not being bound by theory, Applicants believe that the shell services as a barrier to the particle's environment and the matrix binder serves as a material sink that absorbs any material from the particle's environment that passes through the shell. The shell and matrix binder materials are chosen such that the particle is stable in a product, such as a consumer product, during storage, yet the particle releases the benefit agent during use. Surprisingly, the process of making such particles does not unduly degrade the benefit agent and when such particles are employed in a product, they are stable, yet they release the desired amount of benefit agent when such product is used as intended. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present application relates to particles comprising a benefit agent encapsulated by a first layer that is in turn encapsulated by a second material, and products comprising such particles, as well as processes for making and using such particles and products comprising such particles.
