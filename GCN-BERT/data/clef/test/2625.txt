METHOD AND COMPOSITION FOR TREATING ALZHEIMER-TYPE DEMENTIA This application is a divisional application of Australian Patent Application No. 2010296044, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention concerns a method for enhancing the maximal efficacy and maximal tolerated dose of an acetyl choline esterase inhibitor in a patient suffering from dementia of the Alzheimer type by combining said acetyl choline esterase inhibitor with an antiemetic agent, or the use of an antiemetic agent substantially devoid of central anticholinergic activity for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of Alzheimer type dementias in combination with an acetyl choline esterase inhibitor (AChEI). The invention also concerns pharmaceutical compositions comprising an antiemetic agent, in particular a serotonin 5ΗΤ3 receptor antagonist compound in association with an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor to allow increasing and prolonging efficacy and decreasing toxicity of these conventional cholinomimetic treatments such as treatments for dementias in diseases of the Alzheimer type. DEFECTIONS “AChEI(s)”: Acetyl Choline Esterase Inhibitor(s). “CNS”: Central Nervous System. “PNS”: Peripheral Nervous System. “IR”: Immediate Release of the active ingredient from a composition. “ER”: Extended Release (or slow release) of the active ingredient from a composition. “Non-anticholinergic” refers to antiemetic medications not primarily regarded as anticholinergic agents; they are entirely devoid of anticholinergic activity or have an extremely low ability to prevent acetylcholine from acting at its cholinergic receptor sites. “MTD”: maximum (or maximal) tolerated dose, i.e. the highest dose of a drug or treatment that does not cause unacceptable side effects. The maximum tolerated dose is determined in clinical trials by testing increasing doses on different groups of people until the highest dose with acceptable side effects is found (NCI Drug Dictionary). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Dementias of the Alzheimer type include, but are not limited to Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease dementia, and related maladies in humans involving cognitive and behavioral dysfunction such as Lewy body dementia. Most are chronic neurodegenerative disorders of the human central nervous system (CNS) characterized by progressive cognitive impairment, a variety of neurobehavioral and/or neuropsychiatric disturbances, and restrictions in activities of daily living. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia. Prevalence studies indicated that in 2000 there were about 25 million persons with Alzheimer’s disease worldwide and this number is expected to increase to 114 million by 2050 unless an effective preventive or neuroprotective therapy emerges. Onset usually occurs in those over age 65. Clinical signs include progressive cognitive loss and other associated neurobehavioral disabilities together with a declining capability of performing the activities of daily living. The basic cause of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease is not known, probably because the disease is heterogeneous and involves age-related changes together with a complex interaction of genetic and environmental risk factors. Current hypotheses advanced to explain the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease center on the putative deleterious effects of the two misfolded and aggregated proteins, extracellular beta amyloid and intracellular tau. Presumably, as a consequence of the selective neurodegenerative process, the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine declines. This reduction undoubtedly interferes with normal synaptic transmission in brain. Drugs that act to correct the acetylcholine deficiency thus constitute the mainstay of current therapy. Dementias of the Alzheimer type also include cognitive impairments associated with Parkinson's disease. One example is Parkinson's disease dementia, also a chronic progressive CNS degenerative disorder with relatively late life onset. Parkinson’s disease itself primarily affects motor function. But secondary symptoms include cognitive deterioration, especially deficits in executive function. Another dementia of the Alzheimer type that is commonly linked to Parkinson’s disease is known as dementia with Lewy bodies or Lewy body dementia. Although Lewy body dementia is now generally regarded as a separate disease, differentiation from Alzheimer's disease and from Parkinson's disease dementia may be clinically challenging. Lewy body dementia thus tends to be under-diagnosed or misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease dementia. The clinical presentation of Lewy body dementia is typically one of cortical and subcortical cognitive impairment, with visuospatial and executive dysfunction more pronounced than in Alzheimer's disease. Core clinical features of Lewy body dementia, in addition to parkinsonism, are cognitive decline plus fluctuations in attention and recurrent visual hallucinations. Both Parkinson's disease dementia and Lewy body dementia are characterized neuropathologically by the presence of cortical Lewy body pathology and synuclein protein deposition. Genetic factors appear to play a role in pathogenesis. Not surprisingly, the pathology of Parkinson's disease dementia and Lewy body dementia is heterogeneous and overlapping, often intermixed with changes of the Alzheimer and vascular types. A reduction in brain acetylcholine-mediated neurotransmission has been linked to the primary clinical abnormalities found in both these disorders and drugs acting to stimulate cholinergic transmission now constitute the main approach to therapy. In addition to the aforementioned disorders, the off label administration of drugs that augment CNS cholinergic transmission for various other cognitive disorders is widespread. Some of this use involves cognitive disorders for which relatively little clear evidence of cholinergic dysfunction currently exists. Nevertheless, an increasing number of clinical studies now support a rational extension of AChEI treatment to various additional disorders of cognitive function, including but not limited to, vascular dementia, Down syndrome, traumatic brain injury and mild cognitive impairment. As noted above, reduced levels of neurotransmitters including acetylcholine have been reported in dementias of the Alzheimer type and related disorders. In particular, a deficit in acetylcholine-mediated transmission is thought to contribute to the cognitive and certain of the neurobehavioral abnormalities associated with these disorders. Accordingly, drugs known to augment cholinergic transmission in the CNS are widely used in therapy. AChEIs are now part of the standard care for patients suffering from a dementia of the Alzheimer type and are widely used off label for various other chronic progressive disorders of cognitive function. AChEIs have the enhancement of acetylcholine-mediated neurotransmission as a general mechanism of action. All act in the human CNS to increase and prolong the availability of acetylcholine by inhibiting its degradatory enzyme acetylcholinesterase. Four AChEIs have been approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and for Parkinson’s disease dementia: tacrine, donepezil [Aricept®], rivastigmine [Exelon®] and galantamine [Razadyne®]. AChEIs are available in various formulations including immediate release forms such as tablets, capsules and solutions as well as rapid dissolving and extended release forms for oral administration as well as those for parenteral (e.g. transdermal) administration. Other AChEIs, in particular tacrine analogs, such as ipidacrine; phenserine and their analogs; icopezil; and zanapezil are under evaluation. Augmentation of cholinergic transmission in the CNS by currently available AChEIs confers therapeutic benefit to patients with Alzheimer type dementias. Therapeutic efficacy can be measured by the degree of improvement in cognitive dysfunction and other neurobehavioral abnormalities associated with these disorders using standardized scales. Unfortunately, however, none of the currently available cholinomimetic or medications offer more than modest clinical benefit for some patients suffering from any of the aforementioned dementing disorders, even when these medications are administered at their maximum safe and tolerated doses. This is the first problem limiting the success of current AChEI therapy of Alzheimer type dementias. Carefully conducted clinical trials of donepezil at a dose of 5 to 10 mg per day (Rogers et al., Neurology 1998, 50, 136-45; Winblad et al. Neurology. 2001 Aug 14;57(3):489-95), rivastigmine at doses of 1 to 4 and 6 to 12 mg per day (Rosier et al., Brit. Med. J. 1999, 318, 633-38; Farlow et al. Eur. Neurol., 2000, 44, 236-41) and galantamine at doses ranging between 8 to 32 mg per day, usually between 16 to 24 mg per day (Raskind et al., Neurology, 2000, 54, 2261-68; Tariot et al., Neurology, 2000, 54, 2269-76) in patients with dementias of the Alzheimer type demonstrated small, but statistically significant, benefits on cognitive and global measures relevant to dementia. More recently, rivastigmine was given open-label to in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) at an initial dose of 1.5 mg twice a day and dose was increased after 4 weeks to 3 mg twice daily, after 8 weeks to 4.5 mg twice daily and after 12 weeks to a maximal dose of 6 mg twice daily by trying, between weeks 12 and 26 of the trial, to keep the dose of rivastigmine constant at the maximal tolerated dose. According to the Authors, rivastigmine may improve the cognitive functions in PD patients with dementia with no worsening of motor function. (Giladi et al., Acta Neurol Scand 2003, 108, 368-373). A second problem limiting the success of current AChEI therapy of Alzheimer type dementias is that, even at recommended amounts, all these drugs produce dose limiting adverse reactions. These side effects commonly include, for the aforementioned AChEIs tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and weight loss (Physicians Desk Reference 2008, Thomson PDR, Montvale, NJ). The most frequently reported adverse effects of rivastigmine, for example, are gastrointestinal, especially nausea. About half of patients who take this drug in the recommended therapeutic oral dose range of 6-12 mg/day become nauseated and about one-third vomit at least once. Vomiting was severe in 2% of rivastigmine treated patients and was mild or moderate in 14%. Five percent of patients discontinued rivastigmine because of vomiting, compared to less than 1% on placebo. A loss of appetite was reported by 17% of patients, and weight declined in 25% during rivastigmine therapy (averaging 7 to 10 pounds). Presumably, the druginduced anorexia, nausea and vomiting contribute to the observed weight loss. These untoward gastrointestinal effects, as well as others occurring with AChEI treatment, make it difficult to increase rivastigmine dosage above 6 mg daily in most patients. Adverse events significantly reduce the safety and tolerability of AChEI therapy. Attempts to limit them in clinical practice now rely on initiating treatment with a low dose and then escalating the dose slowly. Nevertheless, in current clinical practice, AChEI dosage is guided mainly by side effects and not by therapeutic effects in contrast to most drugs used in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disease. The administration of higher doses than recommended doses tends to increase the frequency and severity of these side effects as well as introduce additional kinds of adverse reactions. These include those generally found with high dose administration of cholinomimetics. In view of the frequency and potential severity of these high dose adverse effects, maximum recommended oral doses of AChEIs are rarely intentionally exceeded in clinical practice. It is reported that recommended maximal dose levels, intended as the recommended maximal daily doses, of these drugs typically achieve only about 45% acetyl cholinesterase inhibition in the CNS of Alzheimer disease patients (Brannan S et al. ACNP 46th Annual Meeting, Program No. 4. Boca Raton FL, December 10, 2007 - “Brannan 2007”) and that inhibition of acetyl cholinesterase activity and cognitive improvement are significantly correlated (Giacobini et al. J Neural Transm. 2002 Jul; 109(7-8): 1053-65) and that, ordinarily, a higher degree of enzyme blockade must be attained for maximum functional effect (Jann et al., Clin Pharmacokinet. 2002;41(10):719-39 - “Jann 2002”). On the other hand, doubling the dose of rivastigmine, which became clinically practical wheri AChEI administration by immediate release tablets was replaced by skin patches, which diminished side effects by blunting peak blood levels, significantly increased the amount of cognitive improvement in patients with Alzheimer’s disease without increasing side effects. By virtue of being dose limiting, these adverse effects also constrain the efficacy of AChEI therapy. Studies in animal models of human cognitive dysfunction indicate a direct dose-response relation between the amount of acetyl choline esterase inhibition and the degree of cognitive improvement (Bennett ΒΜ et al., Neuropsychopharmacology. 2007 Mar;32(3):505-13). Similar conclusions have been drawn regarding AChEI effects on cognitive and behavioral symptoms in human patients with Alzheimer’s disease (Jann 2002; Winblad Β, Cummings J, Andreasen Ν, Grossberg G, Onofrj Μ, Sadowsky C, Zechner S, Nagel J, Lane R. Int J Geriatr Psychiatry. 2007 May;22(5):456-67). The precise causes of the vomiting and related gastrointestinal symptoms induced by AChEI therapy are not known. Presumably, they reflect the cholinergic receptor hyperstimulation attending AChEI administration. Vomiting is coordinated in a center located at the base of the brain. The vomiting center communicates with the nearby chemoreceptor trigger zone, whose stimulation can lead to such complaints of gastrointestinal distress as anorexia, nausea and vomiting. The chemoreceptor trigger zone, which contains numerous serotonin 5-ΗΤ3 and dopamine D2 receptors as well as those for acetylcholine, opioids and substance Ρ, lies outside the blood-brain barrier. Systemically administered antiemetics acting at these or related transmitter receptor sites can thus inhibit vomiting even if unable to enter the CNS. PRIOR ART A benefit of alleviating the side effects of an AChEI was described in a report of four patients in whom the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease with the AChEI tacrine was complicated by peripheral cholinergic gastrointestinal side effects, especially cramping, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea (Faber et al. Am J Psychiatry 156:1, 1999, page 156 - “Faber 1999“). These adverse events were ameliorated by the adjunctive use of the anticholinergic propantheline (Pro-Banthine®) at 7.5 mg to 15 mg taken four times a day. Based on these results, the authors recommended adjunctive use of propantheline in patients with untoward gastrointestinal cholinergic effects from cholinesterase inhibitors. Several reports of benefiting these GI adverse effects with known antiemetics have been published. For example, (See for example Jhee SS, Clin Neuropharmacol. 2002 Mar-Apr;25(2): 122-3, “Centrally acting antiemetics mitigate nausea and vomiting in patients with Alzheimer's disease who receive rivastigmine”; and ScarzellaL, Funct Neurol. 2007 Apr-Jun;22(2): 101-4. Nevertheless, the aforementioned application of the general concept for improving the treatment of dementias of the Alzheimer type provides only limited benefit to patients suffering from these disorders. While potentially lessening side effects, merely employing the concomitant use of antiemetics such as propantheline and domperidone and others fall short of realizing the full therapeutic potential of this acetylcholinesterase approach to the treatment of Alzheimer type dementia. There are several major problems regarding the anticholinergic selected for use by Faber et al.: (1) the duration of action of the antiemetic was too short for current practical use in highly non-compliant demented patients; and (2) none of these reports disclose or suggest that, by reducing adverse events, especially gastrointestinal, it might be possible to increase AChEI dose and thus improve efficacy. These papers neither mention nor suggest using an antiemetic primarily to raise the AChEI dose beyond the recommended maximal dose levels and thus improve antidementia efficacy. In summary, the literature neither discloses nor suggests to take advantage of the side effect mitigation discovered by Faber 1999, achieved with propantheline, or of the nausea/vomiting side effect mitigations achieved with antiemetics to improve the magnitude and/or duration of the otherwise marginal therapeutic response to an AChEI, by allowing to increase the doses of said AChEI beyond the recommended maximal dose levels and concurrently improving neurobehavioral function and quality of life. No attempt was made in this direction heretofore. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Considering the results of the above-cited previously published studies in animal models of human cognitive function indicating a dose-response relation between the amount of AChEIs and the degree of cognitive improvement achieved in the clinically relevant dose range, it has been assumed that if dose limiting side effects of AChEIs could be reduced or eliminated, then the administration of higher doses might provide a much needed increase in the size of the therapeutic effect and prolong the duration of drug action, while at the same time having no significant deleterious effect on safety or tolerability. The therapeutic approach according to the present invention reverses the approach taught by the prior art, in the sense that it provides for an increase of the therapeutic effect of the AChEI (i.e., increase in efficacy) by concurrently globally counteracting their side effects as opposed to combating their side effects without appreciably lessening the central activity of AChEIs, but without increasing their efficacy as taught by the whole prior art. Thus, it has been found that it is actually possible to maximize the effects of an AChEI in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer type dementia in a patient suffering from said symptoms by administering to said patient said AChEI in combination with a non-anticholinergic antiemetic agent as defined above. For the purposes of this definition, a non-anticholinergic antiemetic drug would have the degree of acetylcholine blockade and the ability to influence the clinical effects of cholinergic receptor stimulation of less than 20 percent of that of atropine and preferably less than 5 percent of that of atropine. In particular, according to the present invention a non-anticholinergic anti emetic agent, in combination with an AChEI, reduces, including to the extent of eliminating, the dose limiting side effects of said AChEI thus permitting a remarkable increase of the AChEI’s therapeutic doses, in particular of the AChEI recommended maximal dose levels, and a consequent increase 0f its therapeutic effect. It has also surprisingly been found that by a combined antiemetic/AChEI treatment, the maximization of the cholinomimetic efficacy is achieved with AChEI dose levels higher than the currently maximal tolerated or maximal recommended ones and with antiemetic doses equal to or even lower than those currently used for preventing vomiting. Finally, it has been found that pharmaceutical compositions comprising a pharmacologically active amount of an AChEI and a pharmacologically active amount of a non-anticholinergic antiemetic agent, in admixture with pharmaceutical carriers, improve the symptoms of Alzheimer type dementia in patients suffering from said symptoms, even in the case of patients who have been withdrawn or are no longer responding to the AChEI therapy because of the severe side-effects, thus assuring not only an improvement of the quality of life of the patients, but also an objective and previously unrealized improvement of their symptoms. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention proposes an improved method to augment the efficacy of conventional cholinergic therapies for Alzheimer type dementias by mitigating the common adverse events of cholinomimetic treatments of said Alzheimer type dementias that arise as a result of the concomitant stimulation of cholinergic receptors mediating emesis and emesis-related symptoms at the central vomiting center and chemoreceptor trigger zone as well as at peripheral sites. Νοηanticholinergic antiemetic drugs that act to inhibit the nausea/vomiting side effects resulting from cholinomimetic therapy have the potential to reduce the adverse effects, such that higher cholinomimetic doses can be administered leading to higher and more prolonged antidementia efficacy. By combining an extended release cholinomimetic with a non-anticholinergic antiemetic having an advantageous duration of pharmacologic action, in a single dosage form, the benefits to patients of an even longer duration of action is also achieved. Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for enhancing the maximal tolerated dose and, hence, the therapeutic effect of an acetyl choline esterase inhibitor in a patient suffering from an Alzheimer type dementia without concurrent, appreciable adverse effects, which comprises administering to said patient said AChEI in combination with a non-anticholinergic antiemetic agent. Thereby, an enhanced acetyl choline esterase inhibition in the CNS of said patient is achieved and the symptoms of an Alzheimer type dementia in said patient are improved. The invention also provides a non-anticholinergic antiemetic agent for use for the treatment of Alzheimer type dementias in combination with an AChEI, whereby the maximal tolerated dose of said AChEI is enhanced, a higher degree of acetyl choline esterase inhibition in the CNS is achieved and the symptoms of Alzheimer type dementia are improved to a greater extent. The efficacy of non-anticholinergic antiemetic agents in improving the symptoms of Alzheimer type dementia is due to the fact that said antiemetics allow the increase of the therapeutic doses of all the AChEIs up to a factor of 4. Thus, in the combined non-anticholinergic antiemetic/AChEI treatment of Alzheimer type dementias according to the present invention, the AChEI therapeutic effect is increased by administering said AChEI at a dose level that is higher than the maximal tolerated dose or the recommended maximal dose level of said AChEI when administered alone, higher up to a factor of 4 than the therapeutic dose of said AChEI and, in particular, from 1.5 to 3 times higher than the currently recommended AChEI daily dose in the treatment of Alzheimer type dementia. More particularly, the present invention provides a method for increasing the therapeutic effect of an acetyl choline esterase inhibitor (AChEI) in a patient suffering from an Alzheimer type dementia, which comprises administering to said patient said AChEI at a dose level higher than the recommended maximal dose level, in combination with a compound that reduces, including to the extent of eliminating, dose-limiting side effects of said AChEI dose level, said compound being a ηοηanticholinergic antiemetic agent. The present invention further provides a non-anticholinergic antiemetic agent for use for the treatment of a patient suffering from Alzheimer type dementias, in combination with an acetyl choline esterase inhibitor (AChEI), said AChEI being administered to said patient at a dose level which is higher than the AChEI maximum tolerated dose or recommended maximum dose level. The invention also provides a non-anticholinergic antiemetic agent for use for the treatment of patients suffering from Alzheimer type dementias, in combination with an acetyl choline esterase inhibitor (AChEI), said AChEI being administered to said patient at a dose level which is from 1.5 to 3 times higher than the recommended dose of said AChEI. In addition, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for inducing a higher acetyl choline esterase inhibition in the CNS of a patient suffering from Alzheimer type dementia, said patient taking a dose of acetyl choline esterase inhibitor (AChEI) higher than the maximal tolerated dose attainable when given alone, comprising, as an active ingredient, a non-anticholinergic antiemetic agent. In addition, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an active ingredient, a non-anticholinergic antiemetic agent, for increasing the maximum recommended dose level of an acetyl choline esterase inhibitor (AChEI), said AChEI being concurrently or sequentially administered with said composition to a patient suffering from Alzheimer type dementia. Finally, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an active ingredient, a non-anticholinergic antiemetic agent, for the treatment of a patient suffering from Alzheimer type dementia, said patient concurrently or sequentially taking a dose of acetyl choline esterase inhibitor (AChEI) which is from 1.5 to 3 times higher than the recommended dose of said AChEI. As set forth above, according to the invention, such a remarkable increase of the maximum tolerated dose or of the recommended maximal dose level, inducing an as much remarkable improvement of the conditions of patients suffering from Alzheimer type dementia, is attained without concomitant appreciable adverse effects.

Advantageously, the used non-anticholinergic antiemetic agents are compounds with a duration of action of at least 6 hours, advantageously from 8 to 24 hours, more advantageously from 10 to 24 hours, preferably from 12 to 24 hours, even though non-anticholinergic antiemetics having an appropriate duration of action corresponding to the duration of action of the concomitantly administered AChEI may be successfully used. According to the present invention, the non-anticholinergic antiemetic agent is administered at doses of from 50% to 300% of the currently recommended IR dose in its antiemetic indication, it being understood that doses of from 50% to 200% will be used in immediate release unit forms while doses of from 75% to 300% will be used in extended release or transdermally applicable unit forms. Such a dose will allow the maximization of the cholinomimetic efficacy with AChEI daily doses higher than the currently maximal tolerated ones, in particular with doses of AChEIs at least as high as the currently recommended doses and preferably higher than said currently recommended doses, in particular of 100% to 300%, and preferably of 150% or 200% up to or 300% of said recommended dose of AChEI to patients suffering of Alzheimer type dementia without clinically significant symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, particularly anorexia, nausea or vomiting.

According to another embodiment, the non-anticholinergic antiemetic agent to be administered to patients under treatment with an AChEI is a dopamine antagonist selected from the group consisting of domperidone and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, at a daily dose (in domperidone) of from 15 mg to 90 mg; haloperidol, at a daily dose of from 0.25 mg to 60 mg; chlorpromazine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, at a daily dose (in chlorpromazine) of from 25 mg to 450 mg; prochlorperazine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, at a daily dose (in prochlorperazine) of from 7.5 mg to 120-150 mg; the 4-aminosalicylamide derivatives metoclopramide and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, at a daily dose (in metoclopramide) of from 15 mg to 90 mg; bromopride, at a daily dose (in bromopride) of from 10 mg to 180 mg; clebopride and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, at a daily dose (in clebopride) of from 0.75 mg to 4.5 mg; levosulpiride, at a daily dose of from 37.5 mg to 900 mg; alizapride and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, at a daily dose (in alizapride) of from 25 mg to 600 mg; and trimethobenzamide and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, at a daily dose (in trimethobenzamide) of from 450 mg to 3,600 mg. According to another embodiment, the non-anticholinergic antiemetic agent to be administered to patients under treatment with an AChEI is a HI histamine receptor antagonist selected from the group consisting of meclizine (also called meclozine) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, at a daily dose (in meclizine) of from 12.5 mg to 300 mg; and promethazine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, at a daily dose (in promethazine) of from 12.5 mg to 112.5 mg. According to another embodiment, the non-anticholinergic antiemetic agent to be administered to patients under treatment with an AChEI is a cannabinoid receptor agonist selected from the group consisting of dronabinol, at a daily dose of from 1.25 mg to 60 mg and nabilone, at a daily dose of from 1 mg to 12 mg. According to another embodiment, the non-anticholinergic agent having antiemetic action to be administered to patients under treatment with an AChEI is a neurokinine 1 receptor antagonist selected from the group consisting of aprepitant, at a daily dose of from 40 mg to 375 mg; and casopitant, at a daily dose of from 25 mg to 450 mg. According to an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the non-anticholinergic agent having antiemetic action to be administered to patients under treatment with an AChEI is granisetron or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in a transdermal device delivering from 2 mg/24 hours to 6 mg/24 hours of granisetron, manufactured according to known techniques, in particular as described for example in US 6,562,363 or in WO 2006/028866. The administration of the non-anticholinergic agent having antiemetic action to a patient suffering from dementia of Alzheimer type allows the treatment with the maximal recommended doses of an AChEI without clinically significant symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, particularly anorexia, nausea or vomiting and also allows the treatment of said patients with doses higher than the recommended doses, for example with from 1.1 times to 2-3 times the recommended doses, said doses being higher than the maximal AChEI tolerated dose when used alone, thus significantly improving the symptoms of dementia in said patients. The Clinical Assessment The fact that non-anticholinergic antiemetic agents allow the increase of the maximal tolerated, therapeutic doses of the AChEIs results from a randomized, controlled safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of an AChEI agent alone, such as donepezil, rivastigmine or galantamine, and with a non-anticholinergic antiemetic agent, such as ondansetron, meclizine, prometazine, domperidone, metoclopramide or aprepitant, in normal volunteers. The protocol is that of a phase 1 study of ascending standard doses of rivastigmine alone (as a representative AChEI), and with ascending standard doses of ondansetron (as a representative non-anticholinergic anti emetic agent) in normal volunteers, to determine the difference between the maximum tolerated dose of rivastigmine as monotherapy and the maximum tolerated dose of rivastigmine coadministered with ondansetron as the primary endpoint, the secondary ones being adverse event profile and drug plasma levels. Standard approved oral dosage forms of both rivastigmine hydrogen-(2R,3R)tartrate (simply named rivastigmine in the study) and ondansetron monohydrochloride, dihydrate (simply named ondansetron in the study) are used. The objective: to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety and tolerability as well as the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of rivastigmine when administered alone at daily oral doses ranging from 3 mg to 12 mg and together with ondansetron at daily oral doses of up to 24 mg. MTD, for the purposes of this protocol, is defined as the dose of rivastigmine just preceding the one that produced frank vomiting, or intolerable retching, or that is considered medically inappropriate for readministration by the study principal investigator. The ability of any volunteer to withdraw from this study or refuse any medication or procedure is reiterated on a continuing basis. The volunteers are males and females, who are considered in good general health, aged 18 to 80 years inclusive. No concomitant medications are allowed. The study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over and parallel groups, dose-ranging, non-therapeutic, study conducted on volunteers at a single center. The volunteers are evaluated under blinded conditions following randomization to either Group A or Group Β. During the entire study, oral doses of rivastigmine or rivastigmine placebo and ondansetron or ondansetron placebo will be administered simultaneously once daily at about 8AM for up to 10 days. All subjects will be maintained fasting for the preceding 8 hours (nominally midnight) and until 4 hours after drug administration (nominally noon). Daily doses of rivastigmine begin at 3 mg and range up to 12 mg in increments of 3 mg as deemed medically appropriate. Daily dosing continues until a subject vomits, evidences intolerable retching, refuses further study medications, or the principal investigator terminates further dosing for medical reasons. Daily doses of ondansetron are 24 mg, given once daily at the same time as rivastigmine. In the case of ondansetron intolerance, in the opinion of the principal investigator, the daily dose of ondansetron may be reduced to and maintained at 12 mg. Volunteers who are randomized to Group A receive single daily doses of rivastigmine starting at 3 mg per day and ascending by 3 mg increments each study day, as tolerated, to a maximum of 12 mg per day. Once the MTD (as defined above) for rivastigmine as monotherapy is determined, simultaneous ondansetron administration begins at a dose of 24 mg per day and continues each study day at this dose. One day after the introduction of ondansetron, rivastigmine administration resumes at the previously determined MTD and rises each study day by increments of 3 mg, as tolerated, to a maximum of 12 mg per day. The study terminates for each volunteer once they have reached their MTD for rivastigmine when administered in combination with ondansetron. Volunteers who are randomized to Group Β first receive ondansetron given once daily at 12 mg and then increased on the second study day to and maintained at 24 mg once daily, as tolerated. Then daily doses of simultaneously administered rivastigmine are introduced, starting at 3 mg and rising in 3 mg increments each study day as tolerated to each subjects’ MTD or 12 mg which ever occurs first. During each study day all subjects receive a constant number of similar appearing rivastigmine or rivastigmine placebo capsules and ondansetron or ondansetron placebo tablets once daily. Both study subjects and Center Staff receive no information concerning drug type or quantity administered at any time during the study. Drugs are administered and compliance assured by an attendant in accordance with orders from a medically qualified investigator. Neither will communicate with study subjects nor those having contact with these subjects. Drug dosing will be in accordance with the above dosing schedule as considered medically appropriate by the principal investigator. Standard approved oral dosage forms of both rivastigmine and ondansetron will be used. Placebo tablets (or capsules) will have a similar appearance to the active drug tablets (or capsules). All drugs will be administered orally, once daily in the morning at about 0800 hours. On study days, subjects will be kept fasting from 0000 hours (midnight) until at least 4 hours after drug administration (about 1200 hours). Safety and tolerability are evaluated before, during and after study drug administration by means of reports from subjects as well as by medical staff observations and measurements. Medical procedures including clinical history and physical examination, vital signs and laboratory tests are performed at screening, and at a follow up visit about 7 days after the last drug administration. Some medical procedures are in addition performed each study day. During each study day, all subjects remain under continuous observation from just before drug administration until 4 hours after drug administration, or until all medically significant study-related abnormalities have subsided. The following tests are performed during each study day: review of systems (focused on known adverse effects of the drugs used), and vital signs (sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure and radial pulse rate), just before drug dosing and 2 hours thereafter or until any abnormalities have subsided. A 12-lead ECG is obtained on admission and again 2 hours after MTD rivastigmine administration. Laboratory tests include urinalysis and routine evaluations of venous blood samples (including fasting blood sugar, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin) on the first and last study days. The following adverse events are monitored: (a) Anorexia or nausea, rated daily by a blinded observer during the peak dose period (1 to 2 hours after oral drug administration) in accordance with responses from study subjects during the peak dose period (1 to 2 hours after drug administration) on a numeric scale of 0 (absent) to 5 (very severe). (b) Retching, rated daily as either absent or present during the peak dose period as witnessed by a blinded observer; (c) Vomiting, rated daily as either absent or present during the peak dose period as witnessed by a blinded observer; and (d) Others, rated once daily as either absent or present by a blinded observer in accordance with responses from study subjects: diarrhea, abdominal pain, coughing or other respiratory difficulty, chest pain, palpitations, dysuria or other urinary disturbance, blurring of vision, light headedness, syncope, somnolence, agitation, confusion. For the pharmacokinetic measurements, venous blood samples are collected three times from each subject: (1) at baseline just prior to the first rivastigmine dose, (2) at rivastigmine peak dose 75 minutes after MTD administration and (3) at 4 hours after MTD rivastigmine administration. All specimens are centrifuged, and the serum separated and stored frozen for subsequent assay. The analysis of primary outcome measure is performed both in study completers and in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. The ΠΤ population will include all the randomized subjects who have received each of the baseline assessments and at least one post-randomization assessment. Difference in the MTD of rivastigmine when given alone and together with ondansetron is analyzed using descriptive statistics both within subjects and between subjects assigned to each of the two treatment order groups. Safety parameters are analyzed to compare differences between the rivastigmine monotherapy and the rivastigmine plus ondansetron treatment groups. These parameters include treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, routine laboratory determinations, and ECG measurements.

As compared to known drugs of the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor type now used alone in the treatment of Alzheimer type dementias, the above combined pharmaceutical compositions show greater and longer efficacy and less adverse effects by allowing the safe and tolerable administration of larger and thus more therapeutically effective quantities of said acetylcholine esterase inhibitor. In particular, the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention is safe and effective, alone or in combination with other pharmaceuticals, in treating patients in need of an acetylcholine esterase inhibition, in particular dementias of the Alzheimer type on a once or twice daily basis. The pathologic conditions treated with the composition of the present invention include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease dementia, and other disorders of human cognitive and neurobehavioral function that are treated, in part, by pharmaceuticals intended to augment brain acetylcholine-mediated neurotransmission. The therapeutic efficacy is measured by the degree to which cognitive and other neurobehavioral disabilities associated with dementias of the Alzheimer type, as documented by the use of standard scales, are reduced.
