Technical Field The present invention relates to abrasion resistant steel plates having excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance, and to methods for manufacturing such steel plates. In particular, the invention relates to techniques suited for abrasion resistant steel plates with excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance having a Brinell hardness of 401 or more. Background Art In recent years, there is a trend for increasing the hardness of steel plates that are used in the field of industrial machinery in abrasive environments such as mines, civil engineering, agricultural machines and construction in order to, for example, extend the life of ore grinding ability. However, increasing the hardness of steel is generally accompanied by decreases in low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance and consequently causes a risk that the steel may be cracked during use. Thus, there has been a strong demand for the enhancements in the low-temperature toughness and the hydrogen embrittlement resistance of high-hardness abrasion resistant steel plates, in particular, abrasion resistant steel plates having a Brinell hardness of 401 or more. Approaches to realizing abrasion resistant steel plates with excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance and methods for manufacturing such steel plates have been proposed in the art such as in Patent Literatures 1, 2, 3 and 4 in which low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance are improved by optimizing the carbon equivalent and the hardenability index or by the dispersion of hardened second phase particles into a pearlite phase. Citation List Patent Literature PTL 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2002-256382 PTL 2: Japanese Patent No. 3698082 PTL 3: Japanese Patent No. 4238832 PTL 4: Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2010-174284 Summary of Invention Technical Problem However, the conventional methods such as those described in Patent Literatures 1, 2, 3 and 4 have problems in that the Charpy absorbed energy at -40°C that is stably obtained is limited to about 50 to 100 J and further hydrogen embrittlement resistance is decreased. Thus, there have been demands for abrasion resistant steel plates having higher low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance and for methods capable of manufacturing such steel plates. The present invention has been made in light of the circumstances in the art discussed above. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide abrasion resistant steel plates that have a Brinell hardness of 401 or more and still exhibit superior low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance to the conventional abrasion resistant steel plates, and to provide methods for manufacturing such steel plates. Solution to Problem Three basic quality design guidelines to enhance the low-temperature toughness and the hydrogen embrittlement resistance of as-quenched lath martensitic steel are to reduce the size of high-angle grain boundaries which usually determine the fracture facet sizes, to decrease the amount of impurities such as phosphorus and sulfur which reduce the bond strength at grain boundaries, and to reduce the size and amount of inclusions which induce low-temperature brittleness. The present inventors have carried out extensive studies directed to enhancing the low-temperature toughness and the hydrogen embrittlement resistance of abrasion resistant steel plates based on the above standpoint. As a result, the present inventors have found that the coarsening of reheated austenite grains is suppressed by dispersing a large amount of fine precipitates such as Nb carbonitride having a diameter of not more than 50 nm and consequently the size of packets which determine the fracture facet sizes is significantly reduced to make it possible to obtain abrasion resistant steel plates having higher low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance than the conventional materials. The present invention has been completed by further studies based on the above finding, and provides the following abrasion resistant steel plates having excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance and methods for manufacturing such steel plates. (1) An abrasion resistant steel plate with excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance having a chemical composition including, by mass%, C: 0.20 to 0.30%, Si: 0.05 to 0.5%, Mn: 0.5 to 1.5%, Cr: 0.05 to 1.20%, Nb: 0.01 to 0.08%, B: 0.0005 to 0.003%, Al: 0.01 to 0.08%, N: 0.0005 to 0.008%, P: not more than 0.05%, S: not more than 0.005% and O: not more than 0.008%, the balance being Fe and inevitable impurities, the steel plate including fine precipitates 50 nm or less in diameter with a density of 50 or more particles per 100 µm2, the steel plate having a lath martensitic structure from the surface of the steel plate to at least a depth of 1/4 of the plate thickness, the lath martensitic structure having an average grain size of not more than 20 µm wherein the average grain size is the average grain size of crystal grains surrounded by high-angle grain boundaries having an orientation difference of 15° or more, the steel plate having a Brinell hardness (HBW10/3000) of 401 or more.(2) The abrasion resistant steel plate with excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance described in (1), wherein the chemical composition further includes, by mass%, one, or two or more of Mo: not more than 0.8%, V: not more than 0.2% and Ti: not more than 0.05%.(3) The abrasion resistant steel plate with excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance described in (1) or (2), wherein the chemical composition further includes, by mass%, one, or two or more of Nd: not more than 1%, Cu: not more than 1%, Ni: not more than 1%, W: not more than 1%, Ca: not more than 0.005%, Mg: not more than 0.005% and REM: not more than 0.02% (note: REM is an abbreviation for rare earth metal).(4) The abrasion resistant steel plate with excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance described in any one of (1) to (3), wherein the contents of Nb, Ti, Al and V satisfy 0.03 ≤ Nb + Ti + Al + V ≤ 0.14 wherein Nb, Ti, Al and V are 0 when these elements are not added.(5) The abrasion resistant steel plate with excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance described in any one of (1) to (4), wherein the plate thickness is 6 to 125 mm.(6) The abrasion resistant steel plate described in any one of (1) to (5), wherein the Charpy absorbed energy at - 40°C is not less than 27 J and the safety index (%) of delayed fracture resistance is not less than 50%, the safety index being defined as a ratio (%) of the reduction of area exhibited when the steel plate contains 0.5 ppm by mass of diffusible hydrogen to the reduction of area obtained when the steel plate contains no diffusible hydrogen.(7) A method for manufacturing an abrasion resistant steel plate with excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance, including casting a steel having the chemical composition described in any one of (1) to (4), hot rolling the slab into a steel plate having a prescribed plate thickness, reheating the steel plate to Ac3 transformation point or above, and subsequently quenching the steel plate by water cooling from a temperature of not less than Ar3 transformation point to a temperature of not more than 250°C.(8) The method for manufacturing an abrasion resistant steel plate with excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance described in (7), further including reheating the cast slab to 1100°C or above.(9) The method for manufacturing an abrasion resistant steel plate with excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance described in (7) or (8), wherein the rolling reduction during the hot rolling in an unrecrystallized region is not less than 30%.(10) The method for manufacturing an abrasion resistant steel plate with excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance described in any one of (7) to (9), further including cooling the hot-rolled steel plate by water cooling to a temperature of not more than 250°C.(11) The method for manufacturing an abrasion resistant steel plate with excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance described in any one of (7) to (10), wherein the reheating of the hot-rolled or water-cooled steel plate to Ac3 transformation point or above is performed at a rate of not less than 1°C/s. Advantageous Effects of Invention The abrasion resistant steel plates of the present invention have a Brinell hardness of 401 or more and still exhibit superior low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance, and the inventive methods can manufacture such steel plates. These advantages are very useful in industry. Description of Embodiments There will be described the reasons why the microstructure in the invention is limited. An abrasion resistant steel plate of the present invention includes a lath martensitic steel having a microstructure in which the region from the surface of the steel plate to at least a depth of 1/4 of the plate thickness is a lath martensitic structure and the average grain size of crystal grains in the lath martensitic steel that are surrounded by high-angle grain boundaries having an orientation difference of 15° or more is not more than 20 µm, preferably not more than 10 µm, and more preferably not more than 5 µm. High-angle grains serve as locations where slips are accumulated. Thus, the reduction of the size of high-angle grains remedies the concentration of stress due to the accumulation of slips to the grain boundaries, and hence reduces the occurrence of cracks due to brittle fracture, thereby enhancing low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance. The effects in enhancing low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance are increased with decreasing grain sizes. The marked effects may be obtained by controlling the average grain size of crystal grains surrounded by high-angle grain boundaries having an orientation difference of 15° or more to not more than 20 µm. The average grain size is preferably not more than 10 µm, and more preferably not more than 5 µm. For example, the crystal orientations may be measured by analyzing the crystal orientations in a 100 µm square region by an EBSP (electron back scattering pattern) method. Assuming that the high angle refers to 15° or more difference in the orientations of grain boundaries, the diameters of grains surrounded by such grain boundaries are measured and the simple average of the results is determined. In the invention, the steel includes fine precipitates having a diameter of not more than 50 nm, preferably not more than 20 nm, and more preferably not more than 10 nm with a density of 50 or more particles per 100 µm2. The main fine precipitates for which the effects have been confirmed are Nb carbonitrides, Ti carbonitrides, Al nitrides and V carbides. However, the precipitates are not limited thereto as long as the sizes are met, and may include other forms such as oxides. The fine precipitates having a smaller diameter and a larger density provide higher effects in suppressing the coarsening of crystals by virtue of their pinning effect. The size of crystal grains is reduced and low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance are enhanced by the presence of at least 50 or more particles of fine precipitates having a diameter of not more than 50 nm, preferably not more than 20 nm, and more preferably not more than 10 nm per 100 µm2. To determine the average particle diameter of the fine precipitates, for example, a specimen prepared by a carbon extraction replica method is observed and photographed by TEM, and the image is analyzed to measure the average particle diameter of 50 or more particles of fine precipitates as the simple average. The Brinell hardness is 401 or more in order to obtain high abrasion resistant performance. The plate thickness is 6 to 125 mm that is the general range of the thickness of abrasion resistant steel plates. However, the plate thickness is not limited to this range and the technique of the present invention is applicable to steel plates having other thicknesses. It is not always necessary that the steel plate is composed of the lath martensitic structure throughout its entirety. Depending on use, for example, the lath martensitic structure may extend from the surface of the steel plate to a depth of 1/4 of the plate thickness, and the other region extending from a depth of 1/4 to a depth of 3/4 of the plate thickness as measured from the surface may be, for example, lower bainitic structure or upper bainitic structure. A preferred chemical composition and conditions for the manufacturing of the abrasion resistant steel plates having the aforementioned microstructure are limited for the reasons described below. [Chemical composition] The unit % in the chemical composition is mass%. C: 0.20 to 0.30% Carbon is added to ensure martensite hardness and hardenability. These effects are not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.20%. On the other hand, adding more than 0.30% carbon results in a decrease in the toughness of base steel and weld heat affected zones, and also causes a marked decrease in weldability. Thus, the C content is limited to 0.20 to 0.30%. When, however, the C content exceeds 0.25%, heat affected zones slightly decrease toughness and weldability. Thus, the C content is preferably controlled to 0.20 to 0.25%. Si: 0.05 to 0.5% Silicon is added as a deoxidizer in steelmaking and also as an element for ensuring hardenability. These effects are not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.05%. If, on the other hand, more than 0.5% silicon is added, grain boundaries are embrittled, and low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance are decreased. Thus, the Si content is limited to 0.05 to 0.5%. Mn: 0.5 to 1.5% Manganese is added as an element for ensuring hardenability. This effect is not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.5%. If, on the other hand, more than 1.5% manganese is added, the strength at grain boundaries is lowered, and low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance are decreased. Thus, the Mn content is limited to 0.5 to 1.5%. Cr: 0.05 to 1.20% Chromium is added as an element for ensuring hardenability. This effect is not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.05%. On the other hand, adding more than 1.20% chromium results in a decrease in weldability. Thus, the Cr content is limited to 0.05 to 1.20%. Nb: 0.01 to 0.08% Niobium forms Nb carbonitrides in the form of fine precipitates which serve to pin heated austenite grains and thus suppress the coarsening of grains. This effect is not obtained sufficiently if the Nb content is less than 0.01%. On the other hand, adding more than 0.08% niobium causes a decrease in the toughness of weld heat affected zones. Thus, the Nb content is limited to 0.01 to 0.08%. B: 0.0005 to 0.003% Boron is added as an element for ensuring hardenability. This effect is not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.0005%. Adding more than 0.003% boron causes a decrease in toughness. Thus, the B content is limited to 0.0005 to 0.003%. Al: 0.01 to 0.08% Aluminum is added as a deoxidizer and also forms Al nitrides in the form of fine precipitates which serve to pin heated austenite grains and thus suppress the coarsening of grains. Further, aluminum fixes free nitrogen as Al nitrides and thereby suppresses the formation of B nitrides to allow free boron to be effectively used for the enhancement of hardenability. Thus, in the invention, it is most important to control the Al content. Aluminum needs to be added in 0.01% or more because the above effects are not obtained sufficiently if the Al content is less than 0.01%. Preferably, it is recommended to add 0.02% or more aluminum, and more preferably 0.03% or more aluminum. On the other hand, adding more than 0.08% aluminum increases the probability of the occurrence of surface defects on the steel plates. Thus, the Al content is limited to 0.01 to 0.08%. N: 0.0005 to 0.008% Nitrogen forms nitrides with elements such as niobium, titanium and aluminum in the form of fine precipitates which serve to pin heated austenite grains and thereby suppress the coarsening of grains. Thus, nitrogen is added to obtain an effect in enhancing low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance. The effect in reducing the size of microstructure is not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.0005%. If, on the other hand, more than 0.008% nitrogen is added, the amount of solute nitrogen is so increased that the toughness of base steel and weld heat affected zones is decreased. Thus, the N content is limited to 0.0005 to 0.008%. P: not more than 0.05% Phosphorus is an impurity element and is readily segregated in crystal grain boundaries. If the P content exceeds 0.05%, the strength of bonding between adjacent crystal grains is lowered, and low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance are decreased. Thus, the P content is limited to not more than 0.05%. S: not more than 0.005% Sulfur is an impurity element and is readily segregated in crystal grain boundaries. Sulfur also tends to form MnS which is a nonmetal inclusion. Adding more than 0.005% sulfur decreases the strength of bonding between adjacent crystal grains, and also increases the amount of inclusions, resulting in a decrease in low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance. Thus, the S content is limited to not more than 0.005%. O: not more than 0.008% Oxygen affects the workability of steel through the formation of oxides with elements such as aluminum. If more than 0.008% oxygen is added, workability is deteriorated due to the increase in the amount of inclusions. Thus, the O content is limited to not more than 0.008%. The abrasion resistant steel plate of the invention is composed of the basic components described above and the balance that is Fe and inevitable impurities. In the invention, the following components may be further added in accordance with desired characteristics. Mo: not more than 0.8% Molybdenum has an effect of enhancing hardenability. However, this effect is not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.05%. It is therefore preferable to add 0.05% or more molybdenum. Economic efficiency is deteriorated if more than 0.8% molybdenum is added. Thus, the content of molybdenum, when added, is limited to not more than 0.8%. V: not more than 0.2% Vanadium has an effect of enhancing hardenability and also forms V carbides in the form of fine precipitates which serve to pin heated austenite grains and thereby suppress the coarsening of grains. These effects are not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.005%. It is therefore preferable to add 0.005% or more vanadium. However, adding more than 0.2% vanadium results in a decrease in the toughness of weld heat affected zones. Thus, the content of vanadium, when added, is limited to not more than 0.2%. Ti: not more than 0.05% Titanium forms Ti carbonitrides in the form of fine precipitates which serve to pin heated austenite grains and thus suppress the growth of grains. Further, titanium fixes free nitrogen as Ti nitrides and thereby suppresses the formation of B nitrides to allow free boron to be effectively used for the enhancement of hardenability. However, these effects are not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.005%. It is therefore preferable to add 0.005% or more titanium. However, adding more than 0.05% titanium results in a decrease in the toughness of weld heat affected zones. Thus, the content of titanium, when added, is limited to not more than 0.05%. Nd: not more than 1% Neodymium decreases the amount of sulfur segregated at grain boundaries by incorporating sulfur as inclusions, and thereby enhances low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance. However, these effects are not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.005%. It is therefore preferable to add 0.005% or more neodymium. However, adding more than 1% neodymium results in a decrease in the toughness of weld heat affected zones. Thus, the content of neodymium, when added, is limited to not more than 1%. Cu: not more than 1% Copper has an effect of enhancing hardenability. However, this effect is not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.05%. It is therefore preferable to add 0.05% or more copper. If, however, the Cu content exceeds 1%, hot tearing tends to occur during slab heating and welding. Thus, the content of copper, when added, is limited to not more than 1%. Ni: not more than 1% Nickel has an effect of enhancing toughness and hardenability. However, this effect is not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.05%. It is therefore preferable to add 0.05% or more nickel. If, however, the Ni content exceeds 1%, economic efficiency is decreased. Thus, the content of nickel, when added, is limited to not more than 1%. W: not more than 1% Tungsten has an effect of enhancing hardenability. This effect is not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.05%. It is therefore preferable to add 0.05% or more tungsten. However, adding more than 1% tungsten causes a decrease in weldability. Thus, the content of tungsten, when added, is limited to not more than 1%. Ca: not more than 0.005% Calcium has an effect of controlling the form of sulfide inclusion to CaS that is a spherical inclusion hardly extended by rolling, instead of MnS that is a form of inclusion readily extended by rolling. However, this effect is not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.0005%. It is therefore preferable to add 0.0005% or more calcium. However, adding more than 0.005% calcium decreases cleanliness and results in a deterioration in quality such as.toughness. Thus, the content of calcium, when added, is limited to not more than 0.005%. Mg: not more than 0.005% Magnesium is sometimes added as a desulfurizer for hot metal. However, this effect is not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.0005%. It is therefore preferable to add 0.0005% or more magnesium. However, adding more than 0.005% magnesium causes a decrease in cleanliness. Thus, the amount of magnesium, when added, is limited to not more than 0.005%. REM: not more than 0.02% Rare earth metals form oxysulfides REM(O, S) in steel and thereby decrease the amount of solute sulfur at crystal grain boundaries to provide improved SR cracking resistance characteristics. However, this effect is not obtained sufficiently if the amount added is less than 0.0005%. It is therefore preferable to add 0.0005% or more rare earth metals. However, adding more than 0.02% rare earth metals results in excessive buildup of REM sulfides in sedimentation zones and causes a decrease in quality. Thus, the amount of rare earth metals, when added, is limited to not more than 0.02%. 0.03 ≤ Nb + Ti + Al + V ≤ 0.14 Niobium, titanium, aluminum and vanadium form Nb carbonitrides, Ti carbonitrides, Al nitrides and V carbides in the form of fine precipitates which serve to pin heated austenite grains and thus suppress the coarsening of grains. Detailed studies of the relationship between the contents of these elements and the grain size have shown that a marked reduction in crystal grain size is achieved and enhancements in low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance are obtained when the contents satisfy 0.03 ≤ Nb + Ti + Al + V ≤ 0.14. Thus, the contents are preferably controlled to satisfy 0.03 ≤ Nb + Ti + Al + V ≤ 0.14. Here, Nb, Ti, Al and V indicate the respective contents (mass%) and are 0 when these elements are absent. [Manufacturing conditions] The shapes of the abrasion resistant steel plates of the invention are not limited to steel plates and may be any of other various shapes such as pipes, shaped steels and rod steels. The temperature and the heating rate specified in the manufacturing conditions are parameters describing the central area of the steel, namely, the center through the plate thickness of a steel plate, the center through the plate thickness of a portion of a shaped steel to which the characteristics of the invention are imparted, or the center of the radial directions of a rod steel. However, regions in the vicinity of the central area undergo substantially the same temperature history and thus the above parameters do not strictly describe the temperature conditions for the exact center. Casting conditions The present invention is effective for steels manufactured under any casting conditions. It is therefore not necessary to set particular limitations on the casting conditions. That is, casting of molten steel and rolling of cast steel into slabs may be performed by any methods without limitation. Use may be made of steels smelted by a process such as a converter steelmaking process or an electric steelmaking process, and slabs produced by a process such as continuous casting or ingot casting. Reheating and quench hardening The steel plate that has been hot rolled to a prescribed plate thickness is reheated to Ac3 transformation point or above, and is subsequently quenched by water cooling from a temperature of not less than Ar3 transformation point to a temperature of not more than 250°C, thereby forming a lath martensitic structure. If the reheating temperature is below Ac3 transformation point, part of the ferrite remains untransformed and consequently subsequent water cooling fails to achieve the target hardness. If the steel is cooled to below Ar3 transformation point before water cooling, part of the austenite is transformed to ferrite before water cooling and consequently subsequent water cooling fails to achieve the target hardness. If water cooling is terminated at a temperature higher than 250°C, the crystal may be partly transformed into structures other than lath martensite, such as bainite. Thus, the reheating temperature is limited to not less than Ac3 transformation point, the water cooling start temperature is limited to not less than Ar3 transformation point, and the water cooling finish temperature is limited to not more than 250°C. In the invention, Ac3 transformation point (°C) and Ar3 transformation point (°C) may be obtained by using any equations without limitation. For example, Ac3 = 854 - 180C + 44Si - 14Mn - 17.8Ni - 1.7Cr and Ar3 = 910 - 310C - 80Mn - 20Cu - 15Cr - 55Ni - 80Mo. In the equations, the element symbols indicate the contents (mass%) in the steel. In the invention, the following limitations on the manufacturing conditions may be further adopted in accordance with desired characteristics. Hot rolling conditions When appropriate, the slab is reheated to a temperature that is preferably controlled to not less than 1100°C, more preferably not less than 1150°C, and still more preferably not less than 1200°C. The purpose of this control is to allow a larger amount of crystals such as Nb crystals formed in the slab to be dissolved in the slab and thereby to effectively ensure a sufficient amount of fine precipitates that will be formed. When hot rolling is controlled, it is preferable that the rolling reduction in an unrecrystallized region be not less than 30%, more preferably not less than 40%, and still more preferably not less than 50%. The purpose of rolling in an unrecrystallized region with 30% or more reduction is to form fine precipitates by the strain-induced precipitation of precipitates such as Nb carbonitrides. Cooling When water cooling is performed after the completion of hot rolling, it is preferable that the steel plate be forcibly cooled to a temperature of not more than 250°C. The purpose of this cooling is to restrain the growth of fine precipitates that have been formed by strain-induced precipitation during the rolling. Temperature-increasing rate during reheating When the reheating temperature during reheating for quench hardening is controlled, it is preferable that the steel plate be reheated to Ac3 transformation point or above at a rate of not less than 1°C/s. The purpose of this control is to restrain the growth of fine precipitates formed before the reheating and the growth of fine precipitates formed during the reheating. The heating method may be any of, for example, induction heating, electrical heating, infrared radiation heating and atmospheric heating as long as the desired temperature-increasing rate is achieved. Under the aforementioned conditions, abrasion resistant steel plates having fine crystal grains and exhibiting excellent low-temperature toughness and hydrogen embrittlement resistance may be obtained. EXAMPLES Steels A to K having a chemical composition described in Table 1 were smelted and cast into slabs, which were worked under conditions described in Table 2 to form steel plates. The temperature of the plates was measured with a thermocouple inserted to the central area through the plate thickness. Table 2 describes the structures of the steel plates, the average grain sizes of crystal grains surrounded by high-angle grain boundaries having an orientation difference of 15° or more, the densities of fine precipitates with a diameter of not more than 50 nm, and the Brinell hardnesses, the Charpy absorbed energies at -40°C and the safety indexes of delayed fracture resistance of the steel plates obtained. To determine the structures in the steel plate, a sample was collected from a cross section perpendicular to the rolling direction, the cross section was specular polished and etched with a nitric acid methanol solution, and the structures were identified by observation with an optical microscope at x400 magnification with respect to an area that was 0.5 mm below the steel plate surface and an area that corresponded to 1/4 of the plate thickness. To measure the crystal orientations, a 100 µm square region that included an area corresponding to 1/4 of the plate thickness was analyzed by an EBSP (electron back scattering pattern) method. While defining a high angle as being a 15° or more difference in the orientations of grain boundaries, the diameters of grains surrounded by such grain boundaries were measured and the simple average of the results was obtained. To determine the numerical density of fine precipitates per unit area, a specimen prepared from an area corresponding to 1/4 of the plate thickness by a carbon extraction replica method was observed and photographed by TEM. The number of fine precipitates having a diameter of not more than 50 nm was counted, and the numerical density per 100 µm2 was obtained. To determine the Brinell hardness, an area that was 0.5 mm below the steel plate surface was tested in accordance with JIS Z2243 (2008) with a testing force of 3000 kgf with use of a cemented carbide ball having an indenter diameter of 10 mm (HBW10/3000). The Charpy absorbed energy at -40°C was measured in accordance with JIS Z2242 (2005) with respect to full-size Charpy V-notch specimens that had been collected from an area at 1/4 of the plate thickness along a direction perpendicular to the rolling direction. The data was obtained from three specimens representing the respective conditions, and the results were averaged. To determine the safety index of delayed fracture resistance, a rod specimen was charged with hydrogen by a cathodic hydrogen charging method. Consequently, the amount of diffusible hydrogen in the specimen was increased to approximately 0.5 mass ppm. Zinc was plated on the surface of the specimen to seal the hydrogen. Thereafter, a tensile test was performed at a strain rate of 1 x 10-6/s, and the reduction of area of the fractured specimen was measured. Separately, a specimen without hydrogen charging was subjected to a tensile test at the same strain rate. The safety index was evaluated using the following equation. Safety index%of delayed fracture resistance=100×X⁢1/X⁢0Here, X0: the reduction of area of the specimen substantially free from diffusible hydrogen, andX1: the reduction of area of the specimen charged with diffusible hydrogen. The target values (the inventive range) of the Brinell hardness were 401 and above, those of the Charpy absorbed energy at -40°C were 27 J and above, and those of the safety index of delayed fracture resistance were 50% and above.

Note 2: Structures in steel plate LM: lath martensite, F: ferrite The steel plates Nos. 1 to 7, 10, 11 and 14 to 16 described in Table 2 satisfied the chemical composition and the manufacturing conditions required in the invention. These steel plates also satisfied the average grain size and the density of fine precipitates required in the invention, and achieved the target values of the Brinell hardness, the vE-40°C and the safety index of delayed fracture resistance in the invention. The steel plates Nos. 10 and 14 satisfied the requirements in the invention and involved a higher heating temperature than used for the steel plates Nos. 1 and 5, respectively. Consequently, the grain size was reduced, the density of fine precipitates was increased, and enhancements were obtained in vE-40°C and the safety index of delayed fracture resistance. The steel plate No. 11 satisfied the requirements in the invention and involved a larger rolling reduction in an unrecrystallized region than the steel plate No. 2. Consequently, the grain size was reduced, the density of fine precipitates was increased, and enhancements were obtained in vE-40°C and the safety index of delayed fracture resistance. The steel plate No. 15 satisfied the requirements in the invention and involved water cooling after rolling in contrast to the steel plate No. 6. Consequently, the grain size was reduced, the density of fine precipitates was increased, and enhancements were obtained in vE-40°C and the safety index of delayed fracture resistance. The steel plate No. 16 satisfied the requirements in the invention and involved a higher temperature-increasing rate during reheating as compared to the steel plate No. 7. Consequently, the grain size was reduced, the density of fine precipitates was increased, and enhancements were obtained in vE-40°C and the safety index of delayed fracture resistance. On the other hand, the Nb content and the (Nb + Ti + Al + V) content in the steel plate No. 8, and the Nb content in the steel plate No. 9 were below the lower limits of the inventive ranges. Consequently, their average grain sizes, densities of fine precipitates, vE-40°C and safety indexes of delayed fracture resistance did not reach the target values. In the steel plate No. 12, the region from the surface to a depth of 1/4 of the plate thickness included a two-phase structure, namely ferrite and martensite, due to the reheating temperature being less than Ac3. The failure of the sufficient formation of lath martensitic structure resulted in a Brinell hardness below the level required in the invention. In the steel plate No. 13, the region from the surface to a depth of 1/4 of the plate thickness included a two-phase structure, namely ferrite and martensite, due to the water cooling start temperature being less than Ar3. The failure of the sufficient formation of lath martensitic structure resulted in a Brinell hardness below the level required in the invention. On the other hand, the steel plates Nos. 17 and 18 had an Al content below the lower limit of the inventive range. Consequently, their average grain sizes, densities of fine precipitates, vE-40°C and safety indexes of delayed fracture resistance did not reach the target values.
