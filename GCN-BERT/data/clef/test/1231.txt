Example 4. 2-(6-Chloro-8-(2,6-dichloropyridin-3-yl)-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indol-9-yl)acetonitrile
6-Chloro-8-(2,6-dichloropyridin-3-yl)-9H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole (324 mg, 0.7 mmol) was placed in DMF (2 ml) and treated with potassium carbonate (242 mg, 1.75 mmol) and bromoacetonitrile (85 mg, 0.7 mmol). The mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight, then admixed with water (5 ml) and extracted with EA (3 x 10 ml). The combined organic phases were washed with a saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by preparative RP HPLC. The fractions containing the product were pooled, concentrated and freeze-dried. 36 mg (10%) of the title compound was obtained in the form of its salt with trifluoroacetic acid.
