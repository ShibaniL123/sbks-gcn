TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a method of preparing a cyclic olefin polymer using a metal catalyst complex, and a polymer prepared using the method. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of preparing a cyclic olefin addition polymer using a metal catalyst complex including an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand, and a polymer prepared using the method. BACKGROUND ART Cyclic olefin polymers, which are polymers composed of cyclic olefin monomers such as norbornene, have better transparency, heat resistance, and chemical resistance, and much lower birefringence and hygroscopicity, compared with conventional olefin-based polymers, and thus, can be widely applied as optical materials for CDs, DVDs, or POFs (Plastic Optical Fibers), information and electronic materials for capacitor films or low dielectrics, medical materials for low-absorbent syringes or blister packagings, etc. In particular, polynorbornenes are noncrystalline polymers which have a high glass transition temperature, a high refractive index, and a low dielectric constant, and thus, have been widely used as electronic materials. Much research about polynorbornenes has been actively done by Heitz et al [(a) T. F. A. Haselwander, W. Heitz, S. A. Krugel, J. H. Wendorff, Macromolecules, 1997, 30, 534. (b) T. F. A. Haselwander, W. Heitz, S. A. Krugel, J. H. Wendorff, Macromol. Chem, Phys. 1996, 197, 3435.]. Norbornene monomers can be easily polymerized since they can be easily converted to polymers in the presence of various palladium or nickel complexes and cocatalysts [Ni : (a) WO95 14048A1 (1995), B. F. Goodrich Co., invs.: B. L. Goodall, G. M. Benedikt, L. H. McIntosh III, D. A. Barnes; Chem. Abstr. 1995, 123, 341322p. (b) EP 445755 A2 (1991), Idemitsu Kosan Co. Ltd., invs. : H. Maezawa, J. Aiura, S. Asahi. Chem. Abstr 1991, 115, 256943g., Pd : (a) US 3330815 (1967), Union Carbide Corp., invs. : J. E. McKeon, P. S. Starcher; Chem. Abstr. 1967, 67, 64884g. (b) F. Hojabri, M. M. Mohaddes, A. Talab, Polymer 1976, 17, 710]. However, norbornene monomers having a saturated hydrocarbon ring structure are hardly soluble in organic solvents, and are inferior in adsorptivity to metals, etc. which is required for use of them as electronic materials, thereby limiting the applications of the norbornene monomers. In view of these problems, extensive research has been actively conducted. In order to easily change the physical properties of polymers, for example, to improve the solubility of conventional polynorbornenes, and to provide new physical properties to the polynorbornenes, a method of modifying the chemical structures of norbornene monomers and a method of incorporating new functional groups to norbornene monomers have been proposed. In particular, low solubility in organic solvents of norbornene monomers can be easily overcome by incorporating polar functional groups to the norbornene monomers. Alternatively, research about norborene/ethane copolymerization [(a) H. Cherdron, M. J. Brekner, F. Osan, Angew. Makromol. Chem. 1994, 223, 121. (b) M. Arndt, I. Beulich, Macromol. Chem. Phys. 1998, 199, 1221] or norbornene/functionalized norbornene copolymerization [T. F. A. Haselwander, W. Heitz, M. Maskos, Macromol, Rapid. Commun. 1997, 198, 3963] has been actively conducted. These copolymerization reactions can also contribute to better adsorption of copolymers with other objects. A catalyst mainly used in the preparation of cyclic olefin polymers was a catalyst complex including, as a cocatalyst, an organic phosphine compound that has been used as a σ electron donor ligand. For example, U.S. Patent No. 6,455,650 discloses a method of polymerizing a functionalized norbornene-based monomer in the presence of a catalyst complex represented by [(R')zM(L')x(L")y]b[WCA]d where phosphine and a hydrocarbyl (e.g., allyl)-containing hydrocarbon are used as ligands. Sen, et al. [Organometallics 2001, Vol. 20, 2802-2812] reported ester norbornene polymerization catalyzed by [(1,5-cyclooctadiene)(CH3)Pd(Cl)] and cocatalyzed by phosphine (PPh3) and [Na]+[B(3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)4]-. However, separate addition of a phosphine cocatalyst requires a separate step for converting a catalyst precursor to an activated catalyst and significantly reduces catalyst activity in the presence of a polar functional group-containing cyclic olefin monomer. Recently, preparation of polar functional group-containing norbornene polymers in the presence of phosphonium compounds as cocatalysts have been disclosed in Korean Patent Laid-Open Publication Nos. 2004-0052612 and 2004-0074307. For synthesis of an aromatic olefin monomer (e.g.: stilbene), EP 0721953B1 discloses a metal catalyst complex including an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand instead of a phosphine ligand. However, the working examples of this patent document disclose that the NHC ligand is mainly substituted simply by an alkyl group or a sulfonated alkyl group. As one of various methods for improving the performance of metal catalysts, a method of partially substituting ligands with various functional groups has been proposed. The method is considering an electronic effect of a ligand. The improvement of the performance of catalysts through adjustment of the electronic effect of a ligand has been reported in several documents. For example, an improvement of catalyst activity through a ligand electronic effect adjusted by changing a substituent of a Grubbs ruthenium carbene catalyst ligand has been reported [(a) Trnka, T. M.; Grubbs, R. H. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001, 34, 18-29. (b) Love, J. A.; Sanford, M. S.; Day, M. W.; Grubbs, R. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 10103-10109]. With respect to catalysts used in polymer synthesis, Waymouth found that the electronic effect of a ligand plays an important role in adjusting the stereoselectivity of propylene polymerization in the presence of a zirconocene catalyst [Lin, S.; Hauptman, E.; Lal, T. K.; Waymouth, R. M.; Quan, R. W.; Ernst, A. B. J. Mol. Catal. A: Chem. 1998, 136, 23-33]. Coates reported that when carbon dioxide (CO2) and epoxide are copolymerized in the presence of a β-diiminate zinc alkoxide catalyst, partial substitution of a ligand with a cyano group enables to significantly increase a polymerization rate [Moore, D. R.; Cheng, M.; Lobkovsky, E. B.; Coates, G. W. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2002, 41, 2599-2602]. However, until now, there was no report about a further improvement in performance of metal catalysts through a ligand electronic effect achieved by partially substituting a NHC ligand with various functional groups affecting ligand electron density. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new polymerization method of preparing a cyclic olefin polymer using a metal catalyst complex that shows better performance by substituting a NHC ligand with various functional groups.

In the method of preparing the cyclic olefin polymer according to the present invention, the metal catalyst complex is loaded on a microparticle support. The microparticle support may be silica, titania, silica/chromia, silica/chromia/titania, silica/alumina, aluminum phosphate gel, silanized silica, silica hydrogel, montmorillonite clay, or zeolite. The use of the metal catalyst complex loaded on the microparticle support enables to adjust a molecular weight distribution of the polymer according to a specific application of the polymer and to enhance an apparent density of the polymer. In the method of preparing the cyclic olefin polymer according to the present invention, the metal catalyst complex may be used as a solution obtained by dissolving it in an organic solvent selected from the group consisting of dichloromethane, dichloroethane, toluene, chlorobenzene, and a mixture thereof. The content of the organic solvent may be 10 to 800 parts by weight, more preferably 50 to 400 parts by weight, based on the total weight (100 parts by weight) of monomers in a monomer solution. If the content of the organic solvent is less than 10 parts by weight, stirring may be difficult and unreacted monomers may remain due to too high viscosity, thereby lowering a polymerization yield. Furthermore, it is necessary to dilute a reaction solution using excess solvent to compensate for too high viscosity. On the other hand, if the content of the organic solvent exceeds 800 parts by weight, the reaction rate may be lowered, thereby resulting in a reduction in yield and molecular weight of a product. Alternatively, the metal catalyst complex may also be introduced as a solid phase into a monomer solution. In the method of preparing the cyclic olefin polymer according to the present invention, the molar ratio of the metal catalyst complex to all monomers in a monomer solution may be 1/50 to 1/100,000, more preferably 1/100 to 1/20,000. If the molar ratio of the metal catalyst complex exceeds 1/100, it may be difficult to remove a catalyst residue on a polymer. On the other hand, if it is less than 1/20,000, a polymerization yield may be lowered. In the method of preparing the cyclic olefin polymer according to the present invention, the cyclic olefin polymer may be a cyclic olefin homopolymer having a polar functional group; a copolymer of cyclic olefin monomers having different polar functional groups; or a copolymer of a cyclic olefin monomer having a polar functional group and a cyclic olefin monomer having a nonpolar functional group. A polar functional group-containing norbornene addition polymer prepared using the method of the present invention may include at least 0.1-99.9 mole% of a polar functional group-containing norbornene monomer. At this time, the polar functional group-containing norbornene monomer may be a mixture of an endo isomer and an exo isomer, and the mixture ratio of the endo isomer and the exo isomer is not limited. A detailed description thereof will be provided in the following working examples. The addition polymerization of the present invention may be performed in the same manner as a conventional method of preparing a norbornene-based polymer including: mixing a norbornene-based monomer and a catalyst in a solvent and performing polymerization of the resultant mixture. According to the method of the present invention, a polar functional group-containing cyclic olefin addition polymer can be obtained in a high yield of 40% or more, and can have a high weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 20,000 or more. Therefore, according to the method of the present invention, a polar functional group-containing cyclic olefin addition polymer having a high molecular weight can be prepared in a high yield. If the molecular weight of a cyclic olefin polymer is less than 20,000, mechanical properties may be lowered. On the other hand, if it exceeds 500,000, processability of a polymer may be lowered. The present invention also provides a cyclic olefin polymer prepared in the method, which is a cyclic olefin addition polymer having a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 20,000 to 500,000 and including a polar functional group. More specifically, the cyclic olefin addition polymer may be represented by Formula 9 below: wherein m, R7, R7', R7", and R7'" are as defined above with respect to Formula 2 above,at least one of R7, R7', R7", and R7'" is a polar functional group, andn is degree of polymerization and is a real number of 100 to 5,000.

The cyclic olefin addition polymer may also be represented by Formula 11 below: wherein m, R7, R7', R7" and R7'" are as defined above with respect to Formula 2 above,at least one of R7, R7', R7", and R7"' is a polar functional group,m's may be different,n" is degree of polymerization and is a real number of 100 to 2,500,e and f are molar ratios, e+f=1, 0.1≤e≤0.9 and 0.1≤f≤0.9, anda repeating unit satisfying the molar ratio e is different from a repeating unit satisfying the molar ratio f. A polar functional group-containing norbornene-based polymer prepared according the present invention is a cyclic olefin polymer that is transparent and has good adhesion to metals or polymers having different polar functional groups, low dielectric constant suitable for insulating electronic devices, and good thermal stability and strength. Furthermore, the polar functional group-containing norbornene-based polymer has an adhesion to electronic substrates in the absence of a coupling agent and a good adhesion to metal substrates such as copper, silver, or gold. Still furthermore, the polar functional group-containing norbornene-based polymer has good optical characteristics and thus can be used as materials for protection films of polarization plates. In addition, the polar functional group-containing norbornene-based polymer can be used as materials for electronic devices such as integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, or multichip modules.

Moreover, polymerization in the presence of a halogen-substituented precatalyst (the precatalyst B (-I) and the precatalyst C (-Br)) produces a polymer with a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of at least 5,000 (20,000 or more in Examples 17-18 and Comparative Example 4, 5,000 or more in Examples 19-20 and Comparative Example 5, 10,000 or more in Example 22 and Comparative Example 6, 40,000 or more in Example 25 and Comparative Example 8, 10,000 or more in Examples 26-27 and Comparative Example 10), unlike polymerization in the presence of a halogen-unsubstituted precatalyst (the precatalyst A). This shows that the performance of a halogen-substituted precatalyst is more excellent than that of a halogen-unsubstituted precatalyst. Such an enhancement in catalyst performance is attributed to the electronic effect of a ligand. In detail, a catalyst coordinated with a carbene ligand having a functional group capable of providing the electronic effect of a ligand is used in a method of the present invention, thereby increasing the weight average molecular weight (Mw) or yield of a polymer, compared with the use of a catalyst having no electronic effect of a ligand. In particular, considering that norbornene including a polar substituent generally has low reactivity, the preparation of a norbornene polymer having a higher yield and Mw of 5,000 or more in the presence of a metal catalyst complex according to the present invention is considered to have commercial importance. For example, Sen, et al. [Organometallics 2001, Vol. 20, 2802-2812] produced an ester norbornene polymer by polymerization catalyzed by [(1,5-cyclooctadiene)(CH3)Pd(Cl)] and cocatalyzed by phosphine (PPh3) and [Na]+[B(3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)4]-. However, in the experimental conditions wherein a ratio of a catalyst to a monomer is about 1/400, a polymerization yield was 40% or less and a molecular weight of a polymer was merely 6500. U.S. Patent No. 6,455,650 discloses a method of polymerizing a functionalized norbornene-based monomer in the presence of a catalyst complex represented by [(R')zM(L')x(L")y]b[WCA]d where phosphine and a hydrocarbyl (e.g., allyl)-containing hydrocarbon are used as ligands. In this case, however, polymerization of a polar functional group (e.g., carbonyl)-containing norbornene monomer resulted in a very low yield of 5%. Thermal stability test TGA) TGA of about 4.4-4.6 mg of polynorbornene 2-carboxylic acid methylester (exo:endo=50:50) was performed using a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 by blowing nitrogen (N2) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The TGA results of the homopolymers prepared in Examples 16-18 and Comparative Example 4 are illustrated in FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 2, all the polymers exhibited good thermal stability with no change in weight at a temperature of 300°C or more.
