904 1 o.z. 22,o44 PRODUCTION OF POLYMERS OF ETHYLENICALLY UNSATURATED MONOMERIC COMPOUNDS This invention concerns a new process for the production of polymers of ethylenically unsaturated monomeric compounds. More specifically the invention concerns a process for the production of polymers of ethylenically unsaturated compounds in which navel catalysts are employed. It is known that ethylenically unsaturated compounds polymerize in the presence of certain catalysts according to an anionic reaction mechanism. Two groups of catalysts can be used for this reaction, namely (i) organometallic compounds or alkali metals and (2) combined catalysts consisting of a compound of a transition metal and an organometallic compound. These catalysts are sensìtive to air and water and they are dangerous to handle on account of the fact, for example, that they ignite spontaneously in air. A further disadvantage in the use of these catalysts is that the monomers require extensive purification before the polymerization in order to free them from water. It has already been proposed to use chelate complex compounds of metals of groups IV to VIII of the Periodic System of Elements (Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 38th edition, 394-395, Chemical Rubber Publishing Co., Cleveland, Ohio) as initiators for the polymerization of ethylenlcally unsaturated monomeric polymerlzable compounds. An object of this invention is to provide a process for the production of homopolymers and copolymers of ethylenlcally unsaturated monomeric polymerlzabie compounds in which it is unnecessary to subject the monomers to special purification. A further object of the invention is to provide a polymerization process involving the use of catalysts which do not ignite 73 904 1 o.z. 22,o44 spontaneously. An additional object of the invention is to provide particularly effective polymerization catalysts for use in the process. These objects are achieved in accordance with this invention by using mixtures containing:- (a) at least one metal chelate compound of a metal of group lU/B, VA, VB, VIB, VIIB and VIII of the Periodle System and (b) at least one aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic chlorine, bromine or iodine compound having one to twelve carbon atoms. i0 The process according to this invention may be used for the polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomeric polymerizable compounds such as -olefines, vlnylaromatic compounds such as styrene, halostyrenes, styrenesulfonic acid, i, BLunsaturated carboxyllc acids, such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, esters of acrylic acid with alcohols having one to eight carbon atoms, such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, esters of methacrylic acid with alcohols having one to eight carbon atoms, such as methyl methacrylate and tertlary-butyl methacrylate, vinyl esters of alcohols having one to ten carbon atoms, such as vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl benzoate, vinyl ethers of alcohols having one to four carbon atoms, such as vinyl methyl ether and vinyl n-butyl ether, vinyl chloride, vlnylidene chloride, nitriles and amides of -unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, acrylamide, methacrylamide, vinyl ketoues having four to seven carbon atoms, such as methyl vinyl ketone and isopropenyl vinyl ketone, N-vlnyl compounds, such as vinylpyrrolidone, vinyl caprolactam, vlnylimidazole and vinylcarbazole, fumaric acid, maleic acid, malefic anhydride, malelc imide, esters of malelc acid with alcohols having one to six carbon atoms, such as diethyl maleate, dimethyl maleate, di-n- -- 2 -- 0,Z. 22j044 butyl maleate and the corresponding esters of fumaric acid. The process is particularly advantageous for the polymerization of ;-olefines having two to ten carbon atoms and one or two olefinic double bonds, such as OE-olefines having two to four carbon atoms and a single double bond, as for example ethylene, propylene, u-butylene-(1), isobutylene and vinyl aromatic compounds, such as styrene OE-methylstyrene and 2-, 3or 4-methylstyrene, and also olefiues having two double bonds, such as bntadiene-l,3, isoprene, 2-phenylbutadiene-l,3 and 2,3-dimethylI0 butadiene-(l,3). The process according to the invention can also be used for the production of copolymers of -olefines and copolymers of «-olefines with other ethylenically unsaturated monomeric polymerizable compounds. Copolymers of -olefines are defined as polymers which contain at least 50% by weight of olefines in polymerized form. Metal chelate compounds are defined as compounds in which a metal atom is linked to two functional groups of a molecule by main valencies and coordinate bonds. Compounds of this type are for example described in the book "Chemistry of the Metal Chelate Compounds" by Arthur E. Martell and Melvin Calvin, New York, Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1952. Compounds suitable for the formation of metal chelate compounds (a) which contain two functional groups capable of becoming linked with metal atoms, one group being linked by main valencies and the other by coordinate bonds, are particularly -diketoues, such as acetylacetone, -ketocarboxylic esters, such as ethyl acetoacetate and propyl acetoacetate, and also diacetoacetic esters, for example the ethyl ester, amino acids having two to six carbon atoms, such as glycine and histidine, hydroxyaldehydes, such as salicylaldehyde, dialdehydes, such as chloromalonodial- " 3 - 78 904 1 o.z. 22,0,4 dehyde, and also o-aminophenol, o-aminobenzoic acid or 2,2'- hydroxyazobenzene. Mixtures of the acetylacetonates and 2-ketocarboxylic esters of metals of the groups of the Periodic System referred to above with the aliphatic, aromatic or heterocycllc chlorine, bromine or ìodine compounds are particularly suitable for use as polymerization catalysts for ethylenically unsaturated monomeric polymerlzable compounds. The metal chelate compounds are illustrated by the following fO formula for an acetylacetonate:- o » \ I " • ,Me "-- ?-cH3 C C CH in which MeII represents a divalent metal from the groups referred to above, Me may also be monovalent, trivalent or have a higher polyvalency. Examples of suitable aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic chlorine, bromine or iodine compounds having one to twelve carbon atoms (b) which may be used in admixture with the metal chelate compounds (a) as polymerization catalysts are: monohalogenated and polyhalogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as methylene Chloride, chloroform, bromoform, iodöform, carbon tetrachloride, ethyl bromide, ethyl iodide, n-butyl chloride, n-butyl bromide, tertiary-butyl chloride, n-amyl chloride, isoamyl chloride, n-lauryl chloride, 1,2-dlchloroethane, 1,4-dichlorobutane, 1,4dichlorobutene-2, 1,1',2,2'-tetrachloroethane, hexachloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, cyclohexyl chloride, cyclohexyl bromide, chlorobenzene, bromobenzene, iodobenzene, 73904 1 O.Z. »o 044 .'i :»i xylylene dichloride, o-, mand p-dichlorobenzene, sym.-trichlorobenzene, hexachlorobenzene, hexachlorocyclohexane, and also 2-amlno5-iodopyrimidine, cyanuric chloride, chloropyridines, and also halogenated carboxylic acids and their derivatives, halogenated alcohols, ketones and ethers, such as chloroacetic acid, O -bromocaproic acid, -bromoacetophenone and pentachloropropanol. The metal chelate compounds (a) are used in amounts between O.OO1 and 5, preferably between O.O1 and i% by weight with reference to the monomeric compounds. i0 From O.O1 to 50 parts of one or more aliphatio, aromatic or heterocyclic chlorine, bromine or iodine compounds having one to twelve carbon atoms (b) is used for each part of one or more metal chelate compounds (a). Sometimes it is advantageous to heat the mixture of metal chelate compound and organic halogen compound for some time prior to the use of the mixture as a polymerization catalyst. Monomers which cannot be copolymerized or can only be copolymerlzed incompletely with prior art catalysts can be copolymerized with the catalyst mixtures to be used according to the present invention. For example it is possible to copolymerize butadiene with ethylene, butadiene with acrylic acid, ethylene with vinyl ethers, propylene with acrylic acid, and styrene with ethylene in practically any ratio by the process according to this invention. Some of the polymers have a sterlcally ordered structure; for example polyethylene prepared according to the invention has a high crystalline fraction. The density is more than 0.95. In the polymerization of dienes, the 1,4-cis-and 1,4-translinkage is favoured. The molecular weights of the polymers obtained may vary within a wide range according to the polymerization conditions. 73 9O4 1 O.Z. 22,044 Polymerization may be carried out at between 0O and200Oc. The temperature which is to be preferred depends on the monomers to be polymerized. Thus ethylene is preferably homopolymerlzed or copolymerized at 50o to 150°C, and styrene, butadiene and isoprene are preferably homopolymerized or copolymerized at 20° to 130°C. Any pressure may be used, if desired up to about 4000 atmospheres gauge or more. Monomers may be homopolymerized and copolymerized in bulk with the catalyst mixtures to be used according to the invention. Somei0 times it may also be advantageous to dissolve or suspend the monomers in inert auxiliary liquids for the polymerization. Such auxiliary liquids are for example aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as n-pentane, n-hexane, isohexane, n-heptane, n-octane, isooctane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene, cumene, isopropylbenzene, tetrahydronaphthalene or decahydronaphthalene. Ethers, such as diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, glycol dimethyl ether or glycol phenylmethyl ether, ŒEnd also alcohols and ketones, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanols, cyclohexanol, benzyl alcohol, and acetone are also suitable. The polymerization may be carried out continuously or batchwise. In continuous polymerization, the initiator mixture may be introduced into the reactor in admixture with the monomers or with an auxiliary liquid. The mixtures of metal chelate compounds and organic chlorine, bromine or iodine compounds may be contacted with the monomers by various methods. For example they may be suspended or dissolved in the monomers or in solutions or suspensions of the monomers. The mixtures of metal chelate compounds of the metals of 73 904 1 o.z. 22,044 lO groups IVB, VA, VB, VIB, VIIB and VIII of the Periodic System with organic chlorine, bromine or iodine compounds have a better activity than the pure metal chelate compounds, Thus for example higher rates of polymerization and higher yields are taloned with these mixtures. Furthermore the polymerization may be at considerably lower temperatures at which in some cases the metal chelate compounds alone are practically inactive. The organic halogen compounds act as co-catalysts but are inactive by themselves as polymerization catalysts. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples in which parts are by weight. The K-values are determined by the method of H, Fikentscher, "Cellulosechemie", volume 13, (1932), 58. Example ! A number of mixtures, each consisting of 20 parts of styrene, 0.I part of a chelate complex compound and 0.01 part of carbon tetrachloride are heated for two hours at temperatures between i00° and120°C. The polymers obtained are then precipitated in methanol. The K-values are measured in i% solution in cyclohexanone. The results are collected in Table l. For comparison, styrene is polymerized under the same conditions but only with the chelate complex compound. The results obtained are indicated in brackets in the Table.
