(3) Preparation of 7-methyl-5-nitro-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin
5-Methyl-3-nitrobenzene-1,2-diol (9.5 g, 56.2 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (200 mL), and 1,2-dibromoethane (21 g, 112 mmol)and potassium carbonate (23 g, 167 mmol) were added. The resultant mixture was heated to 55°C and reacted under stirring for 16 h. After the reaction, the resultant mixture was cooled to room temperature, and 300 mL water was added. After extraction with ethyl acetate (200 mL × 3), the organic phases were combined, washed with saturated NaCl aqueous solution, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtrated, and concentrated. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate=30:1) to obtain the product (8.5 g, yield: 78%).
