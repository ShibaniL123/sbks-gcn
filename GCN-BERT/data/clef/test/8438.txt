Preparation Example 3 : Preparation of 4-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-6-methylpyrimidin-2-amine (LXIX)
Preparation Example 3-1 : Preparation of methyl 3-hydroxypicolinate (LXV)
3-Hydroxypicolinic acid (5.0 g, 35.94 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (120 mL). To the resulting solution was slowly added dropwise sulfuric acid (5.75 mL, 107.83 mmol) at 0 Â°C and the solution was refluxed with heat for 24 hrs, cooled to room temperature, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was diluted with dichloromethane and distilled water, neutralized with 6N sodium hydroxide, and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane/ethylacetate = 1/1) to give the white title compound (4.62 g, 83 %).
