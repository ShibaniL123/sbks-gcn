Field of the invention The present invention relates to bioactive particles, particularly for use in medicine, and includes methods for treatment of disorders, e.g., of blood glucose regulation. Background to the invention The present invention is directed at compositions and products, and methods of making and administering such compositions and products, including for the treatment of mammals and particularly humans. Bioactive agents, such as peptides, frequently suffer from poor stability, particularly thermo-stability, which may limit the conditions to which the agents can be subjected during preparation, processing, storage and/or delivery. For example, insulin is widely-used in the control and treatment of, e.g., Type 1 & Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medical preparations of insulin for human use are generally formulated with one or more preservatives and/or stabilisers. Moreover, limited gastrointestinal stability typically presents a barrier to effective-, oral administration of bio-active peptides, such as insulin. Bdoactive agents such as peptide hormones frequently exhibit suboptimal pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties when administered by conventional, methods and delivery systems. Moreover, administration of combinations of bid-active agents is significantly complies feed by varying, and often pearly-matched,. pharmaeokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profiles of each Of the individual actives that, make up the combination. There remains an unmet need for compositions for delivery of combinations of bdoactive: peptides that exhibit a more desirable t r e a fcment ρ r ο £ 1 1 ℮ , Any discussion of. documents,: acts, materials, devices, articles- or the: like which has been included in. the present specification is not to- be taken as an admission that any or all of these matters: form part of the prior art base or were: common 'general knowledge" in the field relevant to the present disclosure as it existed before the priority date of each claim of this application.

Detailed description of the invention In describing the present invention, the following terms will be employed, and are intended to be defined as indicated below. As used herein, "nanoparticle" refers to a particle having a nanomeric scale, and is not intended to convey any specific shape limitation. In particular, "nanoparticle" encompasses nanospheres, nanotubes, nanoboxes, nanoclusters, nanorods and the like. In certain embodiments the nanoparticles and/or nanoparticle cores contemplated herein have a generally polyhedral or spherical geometry. Nanoparticles comprising a plurality of carbohydrate-containing ligands have been described in, for example, WO 2002/032404, WO 2004/108165, WO 2005/116226, WO 2006/037979, WO 2007/015105, WO 2007/122388, WO 2005/091704 (the entire contents of each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference) and such nanoparticles may find use in accordance with the present invention. Moreover, gold-coated nanoparticles including a magnetic core of iron oxide ferrites (having the formula XFe204, where X = Fe, Μη or Co) are described in European patent application publication No. ΕΡ2305310, the entire contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference, and may find use in accordance with the present invention. As used herein, "corona" refers to a layer or coating, which may partially or completely cover the exposed surface of the nanoparticle core. The corona includes a plurality of ligands which include at least one carbohydrate moiety. Thus, the corona may be considered to be an organic layer that surrounds or partially surrounds the metallic core. In certain embodiments the corona provides and/or participates in passivating the core of the nanoparticle. Thus, in certain cases the corona may include a sufficiently complete coating layer substantially to stabilise the metal-containing core. However, it is specifically contemplated herein that certain nanoparticles having cores, e.g., that include a metal oxide-containing inner core coated with a noble metal may include a corona that only partially coats the core surface. As used herein, "peptide" is intended to encompass any sequence of amino acids and specifically includes peptides, polypeptides proteins (including proteins having secondary, tertiary and/or quaternary structure) and fragments thereof. The expression "peptide bound to" is specifically intended to encompass a part (but may include the whole) of the amino acid sequence of the peptide forming a bonding interaction with one or more parts (such as a chemical group or moiety) of one or more of the plurality of ligands of the nanoparticle. In certain embodiments the peptide may have a molecular weight of < 500 kDa, < 100 kDa, < 50 kDa, such as up to 20 kDa. The term "bound" is intended to include a physical and/or a chemical association between two components. This term includes any form of chemical linkage, e.g., covalent, ionic, hydrogen bonding or intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals forces or electrostatic forces. The term includes physical coupling or linking. This physical and or chemical association may be intended to be reversible, i.e., the component may be separated or disassociated, one from the other, e.g., to release the active component from the carrier component. As used herein the term "carbohydrate"" is intended to include compounds of the general formula Cn(H20)m where η = m and η is greater than 3. Also, included within the definition of carbohydrate are carbohydrate analogues / mimetics that are not included in the general formula Cn(H20)m. The carbohydrate analogues / mimetics include but are not limited to pseudo-sugars (carbasugars), amino-sugars, imino-sugars and inositols. Amino-sugars include polyhydroxylated piperidines, pyrrolidines, pyrrolizidines and indolizidines. The phrases "uniformity of active" and "uniformity of active content" are intended to mean that the active is present in the product in an amount such that substantially equally sized dosage units can be prepared from the manufactured product, or some division of, and that the dosage units will not vary in their active content when compared to each other by more than about 10% by weight. That is, the variance of active content from dosage unit to dosage unit is about 10% or less. The phrases "uniformity of active" and "uniformity of active content" are intended to be distinct and separate from other physical properties of uniformity, such as visual uniformity. Visual uniformity may include, for example, a uniform, smooth or glossy appearance, or ability to reflect light, none of which relate directly to the content of the film. For example, the properties of being "mottle free" or being "glossy" relate to surface appearance and shininess, respectively. These properties do not indicate that the content in the product is uniform. Although a product, such as a film, may be mottle-free or glossy, it may not necessarily be uniform in its active content. The converse may also be true. It is possible, of course, that a film product may have each of the uniformity properties outlined above, but each property is distinct and is not dependent upon the others. As used herein, the term "degradation temperature" is intended to mean a temperature at which some degree of degradation of an active occurs. Actives, such as pharmaceuticals and biological actives, are known to degrade over a range of various temperatures and in the presence of other materials. The term "degradation temperature" is not necessarily the temperature at which degradation of the active begins, but is intended to include a range of temperatures at which some degradation of an active component occurs or continues to 5 occur, alone or in the presence of other materials. Any temperature at which degradation of the active occurs is included in this term. As used herein the term "film" includes delivery systems of any thickness, including films, sheets, discs, wafers, and the like, in D any shape, including rectangular, square, or other desired shape. The film may be in the form of a continuous roll of film or may be sized to a desired length and width. The films described herein may be any desired thickness and size suitable for the intended use. For example, a film of the present invention may be sized such that it may be placed into the oral cavity of the user. Other films may be sized for application to the skin of the user, i.e., a topical use. For example, some films may have a relatively thin thickness of from about 0.1 to about 10 mils, while others may have a somewhat thicker thickness of from about 10 to about 30 mils. For some films, especially those intended for topical use, the thickness may be even larger, i.e., greater than about 30 mils. It will be understood, of course, that the thickness of the film may be limited due to the formulation used, and thicker films may require longer drying times. Further, thicker films may desirably be formed through lamination of thinner films. In addition, the term "film" includes single-layer compositions as well as multi-layer compositions, such as laminated films, coatings on films and the like. The composition in its dried film form maintains a uniform distribution of components through the application of controlled drying of the film. Films may include a pouch or region of drug between two films. The active components used herein may be formed as part of a film delivery system. In this fashion, the active components described herein may be dispersed throughout the film, or may be deposited onto one or more surfaces of the film. In either way, the amount of nanoparticles per unit area is desirably substantially uniform throughout the film. It is desired that the films of the present invention include a uniformity of component distribution throughout the volume of a given film. Such uniformity includes a substantially uniform amount of nanoparticles per unit volume of the 3 film, whether the nanoparticles are within the matrix of the film or coated, laminated, or stabilized on one or more surfaces thereof. When such films are cut into individual units, the amount of nanoparticles in the unit can be known with a great deal of accuracy. 3 Uniformity of components throughout the film is beneficial in administering an accurate and effective dose to a user. Various methods of forming uniform films, as well as various additives and fillers, may be used, including those methods and materials described in U.S. Patent Nos. 7,425,292, 7,357,891, and 7,666,337, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. In some particularly desirable embodiments, the amount of active-carrying component, or the amount of active per se, per unit volume does not vary more than about 10%, as discussed above. Thus a large sheet of film may be made and equally sized dosage units cut therefrom and the amount of active-carrying component or active per se in each dosage unit will not vary more than 10% by weight between units. The present invention provides a nanoparticle comprising: (i) a core comprising a metal and/or a semiconductor; (ii) a corona comprising a plurality of ligands covalently linked to the core, wherein at least one of said ligands comprises a carbohydrate moiety; and (iii) at least two different species of peptide bound to the corona. Said at least two different species of peptide may be reversibly and/or non-covalently bound to the corona. The combination of peptides may be bound to the corona such that at least a fraction, or more, of each of the bound peptides is released from the nanoparticle upon contacting the nanoparticle with a physiological solution, e.g. a saline solution. The release may facilitate biological effects of the active peptides, for example by allowing the peptides to interact with their biological receptors. Generally, the peptides will be bioactive peptides, i.e. capable of stimulating a physiological response in a mammalian subject. In some cases in accordance with the present invention, each of the at least two different species of peptide may be independently selected from the group consisting of: insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 ("GLP-1"; including without limitation GLP-l(7-37) and GLP-1-(7-36)NH2) , IGF1, IGF2, relaxin, INSL5, INSL6, INSL7, pancreatic polypeptide(ΡΡ), peptide tyrosine tyrosine(ΡΤΤ), neuropeptide Υ, oxytocin, vasopressin, GnRH, TRH, CRH, GHRH/somatostatin, FSH, LH, TSH, CGA, prolactin, CUP, ACTH, MSH, enorphins, lipotropin, GH, calcitonin, PTH, inhibin, relaxin, hCG, HPL, glucagons, somatostatin, melatonin, thymosin, thmulin, gastrin, ghrelin, thymopoietin, CCK, GIP secretin, motin VIP, enteroglucagon, IGF-1, IGF-2, leptin, adiponectin, resistin Osteocalcin, renin, ΕΡΟ, calicitrol, ΑΝΡ, BNP, chemokines, cytokines, adipokines, ΡΥΥ(3-36), oxyntomodulin and all suitable biologically active analogues of any one of the peptides listed herein. Thus, in certain cases one or more of the peptides may be capable of stimulating a reduction in blood glucose levels in a mammalian subject. For example, one of the peptides may comprise or consist of monomeric and/or dimeric human insulin or a suitable analogue of human insulin. Furthermore, in some cases one of the peptides may comprise or consist of GLP-1 or a suitable analogue thereof. In certain cases, the combination may be a combination of (i) insulin or an insulin analogue; and (ii) GLP-1 or a suitable GLP-1 analogue as well as exenatide and its suitable analogues thereof. A number of suitable GLP-1 analogues are known in the art, and may find use in accordance with any aspect of the present invention. As described herein, the present inventors have found that the in vivo biological effects of a nanoparticle having both insulin and GLP-1 bound to the corona of the same nanoparticle differ from those exhibited by a mixture of a first nanoparticle having insulin bound to its corona and a second nanoparticle having GLP-1 bound to its corona. The combination nanoparticle with both insulin and GLP-1 bound to the corona (NP-insulin/GLP-1) exhibits pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties that are distinct from the aforementioned mixture, and which are in many respects superior from a therapeutic standpoint. The combination NP-insulin/GLP-1 particle may advantageously exhibit one or more properties selected from: reduced glucose excursion in response to a glucose challenge, enhanced biodistribution of insulin, enhanced glucagon response, a decreased in situ pancreatic insulinotropic effect, when administered to a mammalian subject. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is presently believed that therapy based on the combination NP-insulin/GLP-1 particle may be associated with reduced risk of pancreatitis, for example pancreatitis induced or exacerbated by the in situ pancreatic insulinotropic effect of exogenous or endogenous GLP-1. In some cases in accordance with the present invention the two different species of peptide comprise first and second peptides which differ, and the molar ratio of said first peptide to said second peptide is in the range 1:100 to 100:1, preferably the ratio is in the range 1:10 to 10:1. In certain cases, the first peptide comprises insulin and the second peptide comprises GLP-1 and the molar ratio of insulin to GLP-1 is in the range 5:1 to 20:1. In some cases in accordance with the present invention said carbohydrate moiety may comprises a monosaccharide and/or a disaccharide. The carbohydrate moiety may be as defined further herein, including a carbohydrate mimetic. The carbohydrate moiety may be covalently linked to the core via a linker selected from the group consisting of: sulphur-containing linkers, amino-containing linkers, phosphate-containing linkers and oxygen-containing linkers. In some cases the linker comprises an alkyl chain of at least two carbons.

For example the first and second ligands may be as follows: (a) said first ligand comprises 2'-thioethyl-a-Dgalactopyranoside and said second ligand comprises l-amino-17-mercapto-3,6,9,12,15,-pentaoxa-heptadecanol; (b) said first ligand comprises 2'-thioethyl-p-Dglucopyranoside or 2'-thioethyl-a-D-glucopyranoside and said second ligand comprises 5'-thiopentanyl-2-deoxy-2-imidazolacetamido-a,β-ϋglucopyranoside; (c) said first ligand comprises 2'-thioethyl^-Dglucopyranoside or 2'-thioethyl-a-D-glucopyranoside and said second ligand comprises l-amino-17-mercapto-3,6,9,12,15,-pentaoxaheptadecanol ; or (d) said first ligand comprises 2'-thioethyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy^-D-glucopyranoside and said second ligand comprises 1-amino-17-mercapto-3,6,9,12,15,-pentaoxa-heptadecanol, and wherein said first and second ligands are covalently linked to the core via their respective sulphur atoms. In some cases the first ligand may comprise a carbohydrate moiety and said second ligand a non-carbohydrate ligand. One or more of the ligands may be an amine group. In particular, the second ligand may comprise l-amino-17-mercapto-3,6,9,12,15,-pentaoxa-heptadecanol covalently linked to the core via its sulphur atom. As described further herein, where there different ligands are present on the nanoparticle they may be present at, e.g., certain defined ratios or ranges of ratios. For example, the first ligand 5 and said second ligand may present on the nanoparticle in a ratio in the range of 1:40 to 40:1, 1:10 to 10:1 or even 1:2 to 2:1. It has been found that the nanoparticles in accordance with the present invention may be provided with a variety of numbers of D ligands forming the corona. For example, in some cases the corona comprises at least 5 ligands per core, e.g. between about 10 to about 1000 ligands per core or 44-106 ligands per core. The number of peptide molecules bound per core is not particularly limited. For certain applications, it may be desirable to employ as few as 2, 3 or 4 peptides per core, while in other cases the nanoparticle of the invention may comprise at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 50 or more peptide molecules bound per core. The nanoparticle "core" includes a metal and/or a semiconductor. Suitable cores are described in, e.g., WO 2002/032404, WO 2004/108165, WO 2005/116226, WO 2006/037979, WO 2007/015105, WO 2007/122388, WO 2005/091704 (the entire contents of each of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference) and such nanoparticle cores may find use in accordance with the present invention. Moreover, gold-coated nanoparticles including a magnetic core of iron oxide ferrites (having the formula XFe204, where X = Fe, Μη or Co) are described in European patent application publication No. ΕΡ2305310, the entire contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference, and may find use in accordance with the present invention.

The metal oxide may advantageously be of the formula XFe204, where X is a metal selected from the group of: Fe, Μη and Co. The nanoparticle core in accordance with the present invention may in some cases have a diameter in the range of about 0.5 nm to about 50 nm, such as about 1 nm to about 10 nm or about 1.5 nm to about 2 nm. The presence of more than one species of peptide bound to the nanoparticle may exhibit preferred properties (in particular, pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic properties such as bioavailability or treatment profile) compared with binding of a single species of peptide. In particular, combinations of peptides may be carried on a nanoparticle such that the peptides perform mutually beneficial or complementary functions and/or act in concert, such as in a synergistic fashion. The presence of more than one species may be used for the purpose of treating one or more conditions and for one or more therapeutic indications. In accordance with the present invention the nanoparticle of the invention may comprise a component having a divalent state, such as a metal or a compound having a divalent state, or an oxide or salt thereof. For example, metals or metal complexes having the ability to exist in a divalent state are particularly useful. Such a component may be in the divalent state as added or may be transformed into a divalent state after addition. Oxides and salts of the divalent component are also useful and may be added directly or formed in situ subsequent to addition. Among the useful salts of the divalent component include halide salts, such as chloride, iodide, bromide and fluoride. Such divalent components may include, for example, zinc, magnesium, copper, nickel, cobalt, cadmium, or calcium, and their oxides and salts thereof. The component is desirably present in an amount sufficient to produce a stabilizing effect and/or in an amount sufficient to enhance the binding of the peptide to the corona to a level greater than the level of binding of the peptide to the corona in the absence of the component having a divalent state. In some cases, the component having a divalent state is desirably present in an amount of about 0.5 to 2.0 equivalents to the core metal (e.g. gold), or optionally about 0.75 to 1.5 equivalents to the core metal (e.g. gold). In the context of the present invention, "equivalents" may be mole equivalents, for example 1.0 equivalent of zinc may be taken to mean the same number of zinc atoms or Zn2+ cations as the number of gold atoms in the core of the nanoparticle. The divalent component may in some cases be present in the corona of the nanoparticle. It is specifically contemplated herein that the divalent component may be included in the nanoparticle, including in the corona of the nanoparticle as a result of inclusion of the divalent component in the process of synthesis of the nanoparticle. Additionally or alternatively, the divalent component may be added after synthesis of the nanoparticle. In some cases in accordance with the present invention, the divalent component, such as zinc may be selected from: Zn2+ and ΖηΟ. For example, the zinc may be in the form of ZnCl2. In a further aspect the invention provides a plurality of nanoparticles of the invention. For example, a plurality may be 100, 1000, 100000, or more. The plurality may be in as associated form, a suspension or contained together in a single package, container or carrier. In certain cases, the plurality may take the form of one or more doses (e.g. a defined quantity of peptide or peptide activity units), such as in the form of a therapeutic dose or defined number of doses. In a further aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a plurality of nanoparticles of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. In some cases, the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated for administration to a mammalian subject by intraveneous (i.v.), intramuscular (i.m.), intradermal (i.d.) or subcutaneous (s.c) route. In a further aspect of the invention, the pharmaceutical composition comprising a plurality of nanoparticles of the present invention may be incorporated into a nasal delivery system. Such delivery systems may include a variety of stabilizing agents, surface active agents, penetrating agents, typically in a buffered aqueous solution. Desirably, the pH of the solution is chosen such that penetration is enhanced for absorption of the active while minimizing irritation of the nasal mucus membranes. This permits rapid absorption of the active, such as the insulin/GLP-1 nanoparticles, into the bloodstream. Among the surface active agents useful are non-ionic agents such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid ester, polyoxyethylene alcohol ethers, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene alcohol ethers, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ether, polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil and combinations thereof. Generally, surface active agents having a hydrophilic lipophilic balance value in the range of from about 9 to about 22 are preferred. Polyethylene glycol may also be used in place of the aforementioned surface active agents or in addition to such agents. Polyethylene glycols having molecular weights of about 200 to about 7500 and more preferably from about 600 to 7500 are more preferable. The insulin content of the nasal delivery system composition may be from about .1 to about 10% by weight. The upper limit is governed by the need for prevention of precipitation and/or stability concerns. In another aspect of the invention, there is provided implantable compositions designed to controllably release the insulin/GLP-1 nanoparticles into the body. Such implantable compositions may comprise one or more bioerodable polymers, such as poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly(lactic acid)(PLA), polydioxanoes, polyoxalates, poly(a-esters), polyanhydrides, polyacetates, polycaprolactones and combinations thereof. These polymers may be combined with various other components as described herein to enhance the release profile and the erodability and hence, absorption of the actives. The implant may be in the form of a film, particulate, disc, or other suitable delivery form. In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a buccal dosage form designed to adhere to the buccal membrane and controllably release the active. Such dosage forms may comprise one or more of the film compositions described herein which contain the inventive nanoparticles and in particular, the insulin/GLP-1 nanoparticles. In some aspects, the buccal dosage form may comprise an outer film and inner film, whereby the inventive nanoparticles may be present in one or more of the two films. Desirably, the nanoparticles containing the active are present in the inner film. More desirably, the outer film occludes the inner film and provides adhesivity to the cheek, while the inner film is surrounded by the outer film and provides release of the inventive nanoparticles. In such a manner, the nanoparticles containing the actives are thereby directed toward the mucus membrane of the buccal cavity. Nanoparticles of the present invention may also be delivered sublingually, for example using the inventive film compositions. Absorption may be through more than one mucosal membrane, for example multiple dosages may be used or a single dose may affect more than one membrane. Moreover, dosages may be reconstituted in liquid media and used in injectable compositions. In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method of modifying at least one pharmcodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic property of a combination of at least two different peptides, the method comprising: contacting the combination of at least two peptides with a nanoparticle under conditions which allow the at least two peptides 1 to bind to the nanoparticle.

In some cases at least one of said peptides comprises monomeric and/or dimeric human insulin or a suitable analogue of human insulin. In some cases at least one of said peptides comprises GLP-1 or a suitable analogue thereof. In some cases the at least two different species of peptide comprise: (i) insulin or an analogue thereof; and (ii) GLP-1 or a suitable analogue thereof as well as exenatide and its suitable analogues thereof. The method in accordance with this aspect of the invention may be 3 for enhancing the biodistribution of the combination of peptides upon administration of said combination of peptides to a mammalian subject. For example, the biodistribution of the two or more different species of peptide co-bound to the nanoparticle may be enhanced as compared with a mixture of the same peptides which are ) not co-bound to a nanoparticle. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for: reducing the glucose excursion of a subject in response to a glucose challenge; enhancing biodistribution and/or bioavailability in a subject; enhancing the glucagon response of a subject; and/or reducing the pancreatic insulinotropic effect in a subject when insulin and GLP-1 are administered to a mammalian subject, the method comprising: contacting both said insulin and said GLP-1 with a nanoparticle under conditions which allow the insulin and the GLP-1 to bind to the nanoparticle, thereby forming a nanoparticle having both insulin and GLP-1 bound thereto. In a further aspect the present invention provides a method of lowering blood glucose in a mammalian subject (for example a human) in need thereof, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a nanoparticle of the invention, for example a nanoparticle having insulin and GLP-1 bound to the corona. In a further aspect the present invention provides a method of treating diabetes in a mammalian subject in need thereof, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a nanoparticle of the invention, for example a nanoparticle having insulin and GLP-1 bound to the corona. The nanoparticle of the invention or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the nanoparticle may be administered to a subject by any suitable route of administration. In particular cases, the nanoparticle of the invention or pharmaceutical composition comprising said nanoparticle may be administered intraveneously (i.v.), intramuscularly (i.m.), intradermally (i.d.) or subcutaneously (s.c.). j In a further aspect the present invention provides a nanoparticle of the invention for use in a method of medical treatment. The nanoparticle may be formulated for pharmaceutical use, for example by combining one or, typically, a plurality of nanoparticles of the invention with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or ) carriers. The nanoparticle of the invention or pharmaceutical composition comprising said nanoparticle may be formulated for administration by any suitable route for delivery to a subject. In particular, the nanoparticle of the invention or pharmaceutical composition comprising said nanoparticle may be formulated for administration intraveneously (i.v.), intramuscularly (i.m.), intradermally (i.d.) or subcutaneously (s.c.). In a further aspect the present invention provides a nanoparticle of the invention (for example a nanoparticle having insulin and GLP-1 bound to the corona) for use in a method of lowering blood glucose in a mammalian subject in need thereof and/or treating diabetes in a mammalian subject in need thereof. In a further aspect the present invention provides use of a nanoparticle of the invention (for example a nanoparticle having insulin and GLP-1 bound to the corona) in the preparation of a medicament for use in a method of lowering blood glucose in a mammalian subject in need thereof and/or treating diabetes. The subject may be a human or any of a variety of domestic, farm, experimental or companion animals, such as a dog, cat, cow, sheep, pig, horse, non-human primate, mouse, rat or rabbit. In some cases, the subject is has been diagnosed as having, or being at risk of developing, diabetes mellitus (including type 1 diabetes, type-2 diabetes, insulin resistance or gestational diabetes). Additionally or alternatively, the subject may have, or be at risk of developing, pancreatitis (including insulin- or GLP-l-induced pancreatitis). In a further aspect the present invention provides an article of manufacture comprising: at least one nanoparticle of the invention; j a container for housing the at least one nanoparticle; and an insert and/or a label. As described herein with reference to certain embodiments of the present invention, the peptides may be bound such that at least a 3 fraction or portion of the bound peptides is released from the nanoparticle upon contacting the nanoparticle with a physiological solution. As described herein the peptides may be bound to the nanoparticle in a manner such that the peptides are stabilised (e.g. thermostabilised) while bound, but are releasable and available in a form that is biologically active (for example, releasable such that each of the bound peptides is detectable by ELISA and/or capable of exerting at least one biological action in an in vitro or in vivo system that is characteristic of the free peptide). In particular, when the peptides includes (human) insulin, the binding to the nanoparticle may be such that a suspension of the nanoparticles gives a positive result in an ELISA for (human) insulin and/or exerts an effect on blood glucose levels in a mammalian subject following administration thereto. A variety of release kinetics are contemplated for dissociation of bound peptide molecules from the nanoparticle, including bi- or multi-phase release (such as an initial fast release followed by a slower subsequent release phase). For example, the release may include dissociation of one or more of the different species of bound peptide molecules from the nanoparticle rapidly within seconds or minutes followed by further sustained release over a period of at least 2, 4, 6, 8 or more hours. Such release kinetics may be advantageous in certain circumstances, e.g. where sustained action is desired, in comparison with, e.g., an injection of the free peptides. Mixing a Film Forming Matrix As discussed above, the active components of the present invention may be provided in the form of a film dosage form. In such 3 embodiments, a flowable film-forming matrix is prepared to be uniform in content in accordance with the teachings of the present invention. Uniformity should be maintained as the flowable mass is formed into a film and dried. During the drying process of the present invention, several factors produce uniformity within the ) film while maintaining the active component at a safe temperature, i.e., below a temperature at which degradation occurs. First, the films of the present invention have an extremely short heat history, usually only on the order of minutes, so that total temperature exposure is minimized to the extent possible. The films are controllably dried to prevent aggregation and migration of components, as well as preventing heat build up within. The films may be dried from the bottom. In any drying method, however, it is desirable to rapidly form a visco-elastic film within the first fifteen minutes of drying, and desirably within the first ten minutes of drying, and even more preferably within the first four minutes of drying. Due to the short heat exposure and evaporative cooling, the film components such as drug or volatile actives remain unaffected by high temperatures, and small-scale particles of active agent are maintained in a non-aggregated fashion. In contrast, skinning on the top surface traps liquid carrier molecules of increased energy within the film, thereby causing the temperature within the film to rise and exposing active components to high, potentially deleterious temperatures. Preferably, the interior of the film does not reach a level at which degradation of the active contained therein will occur or, if occurring, the degradation does not affect the potency of the film. Once the rapid formation of a visco-elastic film is achieved, to "lock-in" the uniformity of active content per unit dose, the film may be further dried, such as by exposure to heat, radiation, or other drying source. The step of further drying the thus-formed visco-elastic film may reduce the water or solvent content in the film to less than 10% by weight, less than 8% by weight, less than 6% by weight, less than 4% by weight, or less than 2% by weight. Second, thermal mixing occurs within the film due to controlled 3 drying and absence of surface skinning. Thermal mixing occurs via convection currents in the film. As heat is applied to the bottom of the film, the liquid near the bottom increases in temperature, expands, and becomes less dense. As such, this hotter liquid rises and cooler liquid takes its place. While rising, the hotter liquid D mixes with the cooler liquid and shares thermal energy with it, i.e., transfers heat. As the cycle repeats, thermal energy is spread throughout the film. Robust thermal mixing achieved by the controlled drying process of the present invention produces uniform heat diffusion throughout the film. In the absence of such thermal mixing, "hot spots" may develop. Pockets of heat in the film result in the formation of particle aggregates or danger areas within the film and subsequent non-uniformity. The formation of such aggregates or agglomerations is undesirable because it leads to non-uniform films in which the active may be randomly distributed. Such uneven distribution may lead to large differences in the amount of active per film, which is problematic from a safety and efficacy perspective. Furthermore, thermal mixing helps to maintain a lower overall temperature inside the film. Although the film surfaces may be exposed to a temperature above that at which the active component degrades, the film interior may not reach this temperature. Due to this temperature differential, the active does not degrade to a level that reduces the amount of viable active to an undesirable amount. That is, while some degradation of the active may occur during drying, the remaining active is within about 10% of a target level of the active, as will be explained below. For instance, the films of the present invention may be dried for 15 minutes or less, desirably 10 minutes or less to achieve a desired solvent content. Drying the films at 80°C for 10 minutes produces a temperature differential of about 5°C. This means that after 10 minutes of drying, the temperature of the inside of the film is 5°C less than the outside exposure temperature. In many cases, however, drying times of less than 10 minutes are sufficient, such as 4 to 6 minutes. Drying for 4 minutes may be accompanied by a temperature differential of about 30°C, and drying for 6 minutes may be accompanied by a differential of about 25°C. Due to such large temperature differentials, the films may be dried at efficient, high external temperatures without causing heat sensitive actives to degrade. Further drying may be used to reduce the solvent content to an even lower level. After mechanical mixing, the film may be placed on a conveyor for continued thermal mixing during the drying process. At the outset of the drying process, the film preferably is heated from the bottom as it is travels via conveyor. Heat may be supplied to the film by a heating mechanism, such as, but not limited to, a dryer. As the film is heated, the liquid carrier, or volatile, begins to evaporate. Thermal mixing also initiates as hotter liquid rises and cooler liquid takes its place. Because no skin forms on the top surface of the film, the volatile liquid continues to evaporate and thermal mixing continues to distribute thermal energy throughout the film. Once a sufficient amount of the volatile liquid has evaporated, thermal mixing has produced uniform heat diffusion throughout the film. The components desirably are locked into a uniform distribution throughout the film. It may be desired to form a visco-elastic solid rapidly, for example within the first 15 minutes or less, desirably within the first 10 minutes or less, more desirably within the first 6 minutes or less, and most desirably within the first 0.5 minutes to 4 minutes. Although minor amounts of liquid carrier, i.e., water, water/alcohol carrier, or other suitable carrier, may remain subsequent to formation of the visco-elastic film, the film may be dried further without affecting the desired uniformity of active content and heterogeneity of the film, if desired. Further drying forms the final film, by desirably removing solvent from the visco-elastic solid such that less than 10% of solvent remains, and more desirably less than 8% of solvent remains, and most desirably less than 6% of the solvent remains in the final film. The internal temperature of the film matrix during drying is desirably less than about 100°C, desirably less than about 70°C, less than about 60°C, less than about 50°C, less than about 40°C, or less than about 30°C. The external temperature at which the film is dried may be higher than the internal temperature, and may be, for example, 40°C or greater, 50°C or greater, 60° or greater, 70°C or greater, may be 80°C or greater, or may be 100°C or greater. The film may be exposed to a high temperature, such as about 100°C or greater, for a short period of time, such as less than about a few minutes. For example, the air temperatures used to dry the film may be about 130°C or higher, the upper limit being dictated by the specific formulation (e.g., the types and amount of solvent, polymers, fillers, etc.) and active used. The air temperature is also dictated by the length of the drying required to rapidly form the visco-elastic film to lock in the uniformity of content, as discussed herein. Furthermore, particles or particulates may be added to the film-forming composition or material after the composition or material is cast into a film. For example, particles may be added to the film prior to the drying of the film. Particles may be controllably metered to the film and disposed onto the film through a suitable technique, such as through the use of a doctor blade, which is a device which marginally or softly touches the surface of the film and controllably disposes the particles onto the film surface. Other suitable, but non-limiting, techniques include the use of an additional roller to place the particles on the film surface, spraying the particles onto the film surface, and the like. The particles may be placed on either or both of the opposed film surfaces, i.e., the top and/or bottom film surfaces. Desirably, the particles are securably disposed onto the film, such as being embedded into the film. Moreover, such particles are desirably not fully encased or fully embedded into the film, but remain exposed to the surface of the film, such as in the case where the particles are partially embedded or partially encased. Monitoring and control of the thickness of the film also contributes to the production of a uniform film by providing a film of uniform thickness. The thickness of the film may be monitored with gauges such as Beta Gauges. A gauge may be coupled to another gauge at the end of the drying apparatus, i.e. drying oven or tunnel, to communicate through feedback loops to control and adjust the opening in the coating apparatus, resulting in control of uniform film thickness. Alternatively, the thickness of the film can also be controlled by manual measurement during the production process to achieve the desired thickness of the film. The film products are generally formed by combining a properly selected polymer and polar solvent, as well as any agent or filler as desired. Desirably, the solvent content of the combination is at least about 30% by weight of the total combination. The material formed by this combination is formed into a film, desirably by roll coating, and then dried, desirably by a rapid and controlled drying process to maintain the uniformity of the film, more specifically, a non-self-aggregating uniform heterogeneity. The resulting film will desirably contain less than about 10% by weight solvent, more desirably less than about 8% by weight solvent, even more desirably less than about 6% by weight solvent and most desirably less than about 2%. The solvent may be water, a polar organic solvent including, but not limited to, ethanol, isopropanol, acetone, methylene chloride, or any combination thereof. Consideration of the above discussed parameters, such as, but not limited to, rheology properties, viscosity, mixing method, casting method and drying method, also impact material selection for the different components of the present invention. Furthermore, such consideration with proper material selection provides the compositions of the present invention, including a pharmaceutical and/or cosmetic dosage form or film product having no more than a 10% variance of a pharmaceutical and/or cosmetic active per unit volume, or no more of than a ten percent (10%) variance by weight of an active-carrying component (e.g. nanoparticles) per unit volume of the film product. The compositional uniform distribution may be measured by preparing substantially equally-sized individual unit doses from the film, where the substantially equally-sized individual unit doses do not vary from each other by more than 10% of active component. In other words, the uniformity of the present invention may be determined by the presence of no more than a 10% by weight of pharmaceutical, biological, bioeffecting, active-containing component, and/or cosmetic variance throughout the matrix, or in other words, substantially equally sized dosage units cut from the same film do not vary from each other by more than about 10% of the target level of active content. Desirably, the variance is less than 5% by weight, less than 2% by weight, less than 1% by weight, or less than 0.5% by weight. In some embodiments, compositional uniformity may be measured with respect to a target or desired level of active. The film is prepared so as to provide each unit dose with a target level of active therein. Compositional uniformity is achieved when each individual unit dose varies by no more than 10% of the target level of active (by weight). More desirably, each unit dose varies by no more than 8% of the target level of active, no more than 6% of the target level of active, or no more than 4% of the target level of active. In addition, if any degradation of the active occurs during the process, the amount of remaining active that has not degraded should be within 10% of the target level, or within about 8% of the target level, or within about 6% of the target level, or within about 4% of the target level.

Films or dosage forms of the present invention formed from such water soluble polymers are desirably sufficiently water soluble to be dissolvable upon contact with bodily fluids. Other polymers useful for incorporation into the films of the present invention include biodegradable polymers, copolymers, block polymers and combinations thereof. Among the known useful polymers or polymer classes which meet the above criteria are: poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), polydioxanoes, polyoxalates, poly(a-esters), polyanhydrides, polyacetates, polycaprolactones, poly(orthoesters), polyamino acids, polyaminocarbonates, polyurethanes, polycarbonates, polyamides, poly(alkyl cyanoacrylates), and mixtures and copolymers thereof. Additional useful polymers include, stereopolymers of L- and D-lactic acid, copolymers of bis(p-carboxyphenoxy) propane acid and sebacic acid, sebacic acid copolymers, copolymers of caprolactone, poly(lactic acid)/poly(glycolic acid)/polyethyleneglycol copolymers, copolymers of polyurethane and (poly(lactic acid), copolymers of polyurethane and polydactic acid), copolymers of a-amino acids, copolymers of αamino acids and caproic acid, copolymers of a-benzyl glutamate and polyethylene glycol, copolymers of succinate and poly(glycols), polyphosphazene, polyhydroxy-alkanoates and mixtures thereof. Binary and ternary systems are contemplated. Other specific polymers useful include those marketed under the Medisorb and Biodel trademarks. The Medisorb materials are marketed by the Dupont Company of Wilmington, Delaware and are generically identified as a "lactide/glycolide co-polymer" containing "propanoic acid, 2-hydroxy-polymer with hydroxy-polymer with hydroxyacetic acid." Four such polymers include lactide/glycolide 100L, believed to be 100% lactide having a melting point within the range of 338°-347°F (170°-175°C); lactide/glycolide 100L, believed to be 100% glycolide having a melting point within the range of 437°-455°F (225°-235°C); lactide/glycolide 85/15, believed to be 85% lactide and 15% glycolide with a melting point within the range of 338°-347°F (170°-175° C) ; and lactide/glycolide 50/50, believed to be a copolymer of 50% lactide and 50% glycolide with a melting point within the range of 338°-347°F (170°-175°C). The Biodel materials represent a family of various polyanhydrides which differ chemically. Although a variety of different polymers may be used, it is desired to select polymers to provide a desired viscosity of the mixture prior to drying. For example, if the agent or other components are not soluble in the selected solvent, a polymer that will provide a greater viscosity is desired to assist in maintaining uniformity. On the other hand, if the components are soluble in the solvent, a polymer that provides a lower viscosity may be preferred. The polymer plays an important role in affecting the viscosity of the film. Viscosity is one property of a liquid that controls the stability of the topical agent in a solution, an emulsion, a colloid or a suspension. Generally the viscosity of the matrix will vary from about 400 cps to about 100,000 cps, preferably from about 800 cps to about 60,000 cps, and most preferably from about 1,000 cps to about 40,000 cps. Desirably, the viscosity of the film-forming matrix will rapidly increase upon initiation of the drying process. The viscosity may be adjusted based on the selected topical agent component, depending on the other components within the matrix. For example, if the component is not soluble within the selected solvent, a proper viscosity may be selected to prevent the component from settling which would adversely affect the uniformity of the resulting film. The viscosity may be adjusted in different ways. To increase viscosity of the film matrix, the polymer may be chosen of a higher molecular weight or crosslinkers may be added, such as salts of calcium, sodium and potassium. The viscosity may also be adjusted by adjusting the temperature or by adding a viscosity increasing component. Components that will increase the viscosity or stabilize the emulsion/suspension include higher molecular weight polymers and polysaccharides and gums, which include without limitation, alginate, carrageenan, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, locust bean gum, guar gum, xanthan gum, dextran, gum arabic, gellan gum and combinations thereof. It has also been observed that certain polymers which when used alone would ordinarily require a plasticizer to achieve a flexible film, can be combined without a plasticizer and yet achieve flexible films. For example, HPMC and HPC when used in combination provide a flexible, strong film with the appropriate plasticity and elasticity for manufacturing and storage. No additional plasticizer or polyalcohol is needed for flexibility. Additionally, polyethylene oxide (ΡΕ0), when used alone or in combination with a hydrophilic cellulosic polymer and/or polydextrose, achieves flexible, strong films. Additional plasticizers or polyalcohols are not needed for flexibility. Νοηlimiting examples of suitable cellulosic polymers for combination with ΡΕΟ include HPC and HPMC. ΡΕΟ and HPC have essentially no gelation temperature, while HPMC has a gelation temperature of 58-64°C (Methocel EF available from Dow Chemical Co.). Moreover, these films are sufficiently flexible even when substantially free of organic solvents, which may be removed without compromising film properties. As such, if there is no solvent present, then there is no plasticizer in the films. ΡΕΟ based films also exhibit good resistance to tearing, little or no curling, and fast dissolution rates when the polymer component contains appropriate levels of ΡΕΟ. To achieve the desired film properties, the level and/or molecular weight of ΡΕΟ in the polymer component may be varied. Modifying the ΡΕΟ content affects properties such as tear resistance, dissolution rate, and adhesion tendencies. Thus, one method for controlling film properties is to modify the ΡΕΟ content. For instance, in some embodiments rapid dissolving films are desirable. By modifying the content of the polymer component, the desired dissolution characteristics can be achieved. In accordance with the present invention, ΡΕΟ desirably ranges from about 201 to 100% by weight in the polymer component. In some embodiments, the amount of ΡΕΟ desirably ranges from about lmg to about 200mg. The hydrophilic cellulosic polymer and/or polydextrose ranges from about 0% to about 80% by weight, or in a ratio of up to about 4:1 with the ΡΕΟ, and desirably in a ratio of about 1:1. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to vary the ΡΕΟ levels to promote certain film properties. To obtain films with high tear resistance and fast dissolution rates, levels of about 50% or greater of ΡΕΟ in the polymer component are desirable. To achieve adhesion prevention, i.e., preventing the film from adhering to the roof of the mouth, ΡΕΟ levels of about 20% to 75% are desirable. In some embodiments, however, adhesion to the roof of the mouth may be desired, such as for administration to animals or children. In such cases, higher levels of ΡΕΟ may be employed. More specifically, structural integrity and dissolution of the film can be controlled such that the film can adhere to mucosa and be readily removed, or adhere more firmly and be difficult to remove, depending on the intended use. The molecular weight of the ΡΕΟ may also be varied. High molecular weight ΡΕΟ, such as about 4 million, may be desired to increase mucoadhesivity of the film. More desirably, the molecular weight may range from about 100,000 to 900,000, more desirably from about 100,000 to 600,000, and most desirably from about 100,000 to 300,000. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to combine high molecular weight (600,000 to 900,000) with low molecular weight (100,000 to 300,000) PEOs in the polymer component. For instance, certain film properties, such as fast dissolution rates and high tear resistance, may be attained by combining small amounts of high molecular weight PEOs with larger amounts of lower molecular weight PEOs. Desirably, such compositions contain about 60% or greater levels of the lower molecular weight ΡΕΟ in the ΡΕΟblend polymer component. To balance the properties of adhesion prevention, fast dissolution rate, and good tear resistance, desirable film compositions may include about 50% to 75%, by weight of the total composition, low molecular weight ΡΕΟ, optionally combined with a small amount of a higher molecular weight ΡΕΟ, with the remainder of the polymer component containing a hydrophilic cellulosic polymer (HPC or HPMC) and/or polydextrose. In some embodiments the film may include polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), alone or in combination with at least one additional polymer Examples of an additional polymer include a cellulosic polymer, starch, polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), polyethylene oxide (ΡΕΟ), an alginate, a pectin, or combinations thereof. PVA can be used in the films to improve film strength and/or to vary and slow dissolution times. The films are especially useful for the delivery of cosmetics, nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals. In a preferred embodiment, the film includes PVA without any added plasticizers. For example, the film can include both PVA, which provides strength to the film and ΡΕΟ, which provides flexibility to the film and nay obviate the need for a plasticizer. PVA can be used in varying amounts depending upon the product application and characteristics desired. For example, in general, a larger amount of PVA will increase film strength and increase dissolution time. For films that require high active dosing, PVA can be used effectively at minimum amount of 0.5, preferably 1%, more preferably 5%, by weight of the film, to improve film strength. The PVA an be effectively used at a maximum amount, for example, 80%, preferably 50%, more preferably 25% by weight of the film. For slowing dissolution time, PVA can be used at levels as high as 80%. A film containing an active can be coated on one or both surfaces with a PVA containing layer to modify the dissolution of the film and the release of an active from the film. High loading of actives can decrease the strength and flexibility of the film. Including PVA in the film either alone or in combination with at least one other polymer can increase the tensile strength of the film. Also, drug particles or taste-masked or coated or modified release drug particles may have a larger particle size, which can make loading of these particles into the film difficult. PVA can increase the viscosity of the film solution to allow improved drug loading. Controlled Release Films The term "controlled release" is intended to mean the release of the components at a pre-selected or desired rate. For example, in embodiments where the film includes nanoparticles within the body of the film, it may be desirable to control its release from the film. This rate will vary depending upon the application. Desirable rates include fast or immediate release profiles as well as delayed, sustained or sequential release. Combinations of release patterns, such as initial spiked release followed by lower levels of sustained release of active are contemplated. Pulsed releases of the agent are also contemplated. Dissolvable films generally fall into three main classes: fast dissolving, moderate dissolving and slow dissolving. Films of the present invention are dissolvable in the presence of liquid, such as in the oral cavity of the user or when mixed with a liquid, such as water. Fast dissolving films generally dissolve in about 1 second to about 30 seconds. Moderate dissolving films generally dissolve in about 1 to about 30 minutes, and slow dissolving films generally dissolve in more than 30 minutes, e.g., up to about 60 minutes or more. Fast dissolving films may consist of low molecular weight hydrophilic polymers (i.e., polymers having a molecular weight between about 1,000 to 200,000). In contrast, slow dissolving films generally have high molecular weight polymers (i.e., having a molecular weight in the millions). Moderate dissolving films tend to fall in between the fast and slow dissolving films. Moderate dissolving films dissolve rather quickly, but also have a good level of mucoadhesion. Moderate films are also flexible, quickly wettable, and are typically nonirritating to the user. For oral-dissolving films, moderate dissolving films are preferred, since such films provide a quick enough dissolution rate (between about 1 minute and about 5 minutes), while providing an acceptable mucoadhesion level such that the film is not easily removable once it is placed in the oral cavity of the user. The polymers that are chosen for the films of the present invention may also be chosen to allow for controlled disintegration of the components. This may be achieved by providing a substantially water insoluble film that incorporates an nanoparticle that will be released from the film over time. This may be accomplished by incorporating a variety of different soluble or insoluble polymers and may also include biodegradable polymers in combination. Alternatively, coated controlled release agent particles may be incorporated into a readily soluble film matrix to achieve the controlled release property of the nanoparticles. The convenience of administering a single dose of a medication which releases components in a controlled fashion over an extended period of time, as opposed to the administration of a number of single doses at regular intervals has long been recognized in the pharmaceutical arts. The advantage to the patient and clinician in having consistent and uniform levels of medication delivered to the body over an extended period of time are likewise recognized. In some embodiments, the erosion or disintegration of the film (e.g., the residence time) can be controlled by a combination of factors. One factor may be the thickness of the film, whereby due to its physical dimensions, disintegration of a thicker film in the body, such as in the oral cavity, as with a buccal dosage form, is designed to be slower than a film that has thinner dimensions. Additionally, the selection of amounts and types of polymers and/or molecular weights of polymers, as well as inclusion of additives or disintegration aides, may be employed to vary residence time. Selection of polymers and inclusion of additives may be used alone or in combination with the use of different thicknesses to achieve the desired residence time. These factors have the ability to effect the release of active in a desired time. Optional Components A variety of other components and fillers may also be added to the films of the present invention. These may include, without limitation, surfactants; plasticizers which assist in compatibilizing the components within the mixture; polyalcohols; anti-foaming agents, such as silicone-containing compounds, which promote a smoother film surface by releasing oxygen from the film; and thermo-setting gels such as pectin, carageenan, and gelatin, which help in maintaining the dispersion of components. The variety of additives that can be incorporated into the inventive compositions may provide a variety of different functions. Examples of classes of additives include excipients, lubricants, buffering agents, stabilizers, blowing agents, pigments, coloring agents, fillers, bulking agents, fragrances, release modifiers, adjuvants, plasticizers, flow accelerators, mold release agents, polyols, granulating agents, diluents, binders, buffers, absorbents, glidants, adhesives, anti-adherents, acidulants, softeners, resins, demulcents, solvents, surfactants, emulsifiers, elastomers and mixtures thereof. These additives may be added with the active ingredient(s). Useful additives include, for example, gelatin, vegetable proteins such as sunflower protein, soybean proteins, cotton seed proteins, peanut proteins, grape seed proteins, whey proteins, whey protein isolates, blood proteins, egg proteins, acrylated proteins, water soluble polysaccharides such as alginates, carrageenans, guar gum, agar-agar, xanthan gum, gellan gum, gum arabic and related gums (gum ghatti, gum karaya, gum tragancanth), pectin, water soluble derivatives of cellulose: alkylcelluloses hydroxyalkylcelluloses and hydroxyalkylalkylcelluloses, such as methylcelulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxyethylmethy1cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxybutylmethylcellulose, cellulose esters and hydroxyalkylcellulose esters such as cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC); carboxyalkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylalkylcelluloses, carboxyalkylcellulose esters such as carboxymethylcellulose and their alkali metal salts; water soluble synthetic polymers such as polyacrylic acids and polyacrylic acid esters, polymethacrylic acids and polymethacrylic acid esters, polyvinylacetates, polyvinylalcohols, polyvinylacetatephthalates (PVAP), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), PVY/vinyl acetate copolymer, and polycrotonic acids; also suitable are phthalated gelatin, gelatin succinate, crosslinked gelatin, shellac, water soluble chemical derivatives of starch, cationically modified acrylates and methacrylates possessing, for example, a tertiary or quaternary amino group, such as the diethylaminoethyl group, which may be quaternized if desired; and other similar polymers. Such extenders may optionally be added in any desired amount desirably within the range of up to about 80%, desirably about 3% to 50% and more desirably within the range of 3% to 20% based on the weight of all components. Further additives may be glidants and opacifiers, such as the oxides of magnesium aluminum, silicon, titanium, etc. desirably in a concentration range of about 0.02% to about 3% by weight and desirably about 0.02% to about 1% based on the weight of all components. Further examples of additives are plasticizers which include polyalkylene oxides, such as polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, polyethylene-propylene glycols, organic plasticizers with low molecular weights, such as glycerol, glycerol monoacetate, diacetate or triacetate, triacetin, polysorbate, cetyl alcohol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, sodium diethylsulfosuccinate, triethyl citrate, tributyl citrate, and the like, added in concentrations ranging from about 0.5% to about 30%, and desirably ranging from about 0.5% to about 20% based on the weight of the polymer. There may further be added compounds to improve the texture of the starch material such as animal or vegetable fats, desirably in their hydrogenated form, especially those which are solid at room temperature. These fats desirably have a melting point of 50°C or higher. Preferred are tri-glycerides with C12-, C14-, Ci6-, Ci8-, C2oand C22“ fatty acids. These fats can be added alone without adding extenders or plasticizers and can be advantageously added alone or together with mono- and/or di-glycerides or phosphatides, especially lecithin. The mono- and di-glycerides are desirably derived from the types of fats described above, i.e. with Ci2-, C14-, Ci6~, Ci8-, C2o_ and C22~ fatty acids. The total amounts used of the fats, mono-, di-glycerides and/or lecithins are up to about 5% and preferably within the range of about 0.5% to about 2% by weight of the total composition It is further useful to add silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, or titanium dioxide in a concentration of about 0.02% to about 1% by weight of the total composition. These compounds act as opacifiers and flow agents. These additives are to be used in amounts sufficient to achieve their intended purpose. Generally, the combination of certain of these additives will alter the overall release profile of the active ingredient and can be used to modify, i.e. impede or accelerate the release. Lecithin is one surface active agent for use in the present invention. Lecithin can be included in the feedstock in an amount of from about 0.25% to about 2.00% by weight. Other surface active agents, i.e. surfactants, include, but are not limited to, cetyl alcohol, sodium lauryl sulfate, the Spans™ and Tweens™ which are commercially available from ICI Americas, Inc. Ethoxylated oils, including ethoxylated castor oils, such as Cremophor® EL which is commercially available from BASF, are also useful. Carbowax™ is yet another modifier which is very useful in the present invention. Tweens™ or combinations of surface active agents may be used to achieve the desired hydrophilic-lipophilic balance ("HLB"). The present invention, however, does not require the use of a surfactant and films or film-forming compositions of the present invention may be essentially free of a surfactant while still providing the desirable uniformity features of the present invention. As additional modifiers which enhance the procedure and product of the present invention are identified, Applicants intend to include all such additional modifiers within the scope of the invention claimed herein. Other ingredients include binders which contribute to the ease of formation and general quality of the films. Non-limiting examples of binders include starches, pregelatinize starches, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, polyacrylamides, polyvinyloxoazolidone, and polyvinylalcohols. Films of the present invention, particularly films useful for oral ingestion by a user, may further include one or more taste-enhancing agents, such as flavors and/or sweeteners. Suitable flavors and sweeteners include those set forth in U.S. Patent No. 7,425,292, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. Further potential additives include solubility enhancing agents, such as substances that form inclusion compounds with active components. Such agents may be useful in improving the properties of very insoluble and/or unstable actives. In general, these substances are doughnut-shaped molecules with hydrophobic internal cavities and hydrophilic exteriors. Insoluble and/or instable actives may fit within the hydrophobic cavity, thereby producing an inclusion complex, which is soluble in water. Accordingly, the formation of the inclusion complex permits very insoluble and/or instable actives to be dissolved in water. A particularly desirable example of such agents are cyclodextrins, which are cyclic carbohydrates derived from starch. Other similar substances, however, are considered well within the scope of the present invention. The various embodiments of the invention may include penetration and permeation enhancers. Among such useful enhancers are included medium chain mono- and diacylglycerol fatty acid derivative, such as glycerol laurate, and mixtures thereof; synthetic and natural surfactants and mixtures thereof; medium chain fatty acids and salts and esters thereof, including mono-, di- and triglycerides such as sodium caprylate and sodium caprate and mixtures thereof; bile salts; chelating agents, such as EDTA; detergents; cylodextrins, enamine derivatives, phospholipids, lecithins, cetomacrogels, sodium salicylate, sodium-5-methoxysalicyclic acid; glycerol and polyethylene glycol estess such as those sold under the name Labrasol; zonula occludens toxin; and alkyl glycosides.

As previously stated, combinations of penetration and permeation enhancers from different classes are also useful. Forming the Film The films of the present invention may be formed into a film strip or a sheet prior to drying. After the desired components are combined to form a multi-component matrix, including the polymer, water, and nanoparticles, as well as any other component as desired, the combination is formed into a sheet or film, by any method known in the art such as coating, spreading, casting or drawing the multi-component matrix. If a multi-layered film is desired, this may be accomplished by co-extruding more than one combination of components which may be of the same or different composition. A multi-layered film may also be achieved by coating, spreading, or casting a combination onto an already formed film layer, thus forming a multi-layered film with the already formed film layer and a second layer. The already formed film layer may be the same or may be different than the second layer. The already formed film layer may be partially dried when the second layer is coated, spread, or cast onto its surface, or it may be fully dried to a desired solvent content. The already formed film layer may be dissolvable or disintegrable, and its dissolution or disintegration time may be longer or shorter than that of the second film layer. A number of techniques may be employed in the mixing stage to prevent bubble inclusions in the final film. To provide a composition mixture with substantially no air bubble formation in the final product, anti-foaming or surface-tension reducing agents are employed. Additionally, the speed of the mixture is desirably controlled to prevent cavitation of the mixture in a manner which pulls air into the mix. Finally, air bubble reduction can further be achieved by allowing the mix to stand for a sufficient time for bubbles to escape prior to drying the film. Desirably, the inventive process first forms a masterbatch of film-forming components without active ingredients or volatile materials. In one embodiment, the active(s) are combined with smaller mixes of the masterbatch just prior to casting. Thus, the masterbatch pre-mix can be allowed to stand for a longer time without concern for instability of the active agent or other ingredients. Although a variety of different film-forming techniques may be used, it is desirable to select a method that will provide a flexible film, such as reverse roll coating. The flexibility of the film allows for the sheets of film to be rolled and transported for storage or prior to being cut into individual dosage forms. Desirably, the films will also be self-supporting or, in other words, able to maintain their integrity and structure in the absence of a separate support. Furthermore, the films of the present invention may be selected of materials that are edible or ingestible. Casting or Depositing the Film Composition The invention uses processes for making self-supporting films having a substantially uniform distribution of components. The self supporting film is particularly useful for delivery of actives as discussed herein. The processes for making the film are designed to maintain the compositional uniformity of components distributed throughout the film, which is particularly necessary when actives, such as pharmaceutical actives, are incorporated into the film. In the pharmaceutical context, it is essential that the film is compositionally uniform so that it can be divided into individual film dosage units, each dosage unit having the appropriate amount of active when administered, such that regulatory approval can be secured. The process may further include the preliminary steps of forming a masterbatch premix of an edible water-soluble polymer and water; optionally deaerating the premix (such as by mixing); feeding a predetermining amount of the premix to at least one mixer; adding the nanoparticles to the mixer; and mixing the components to achieve a uniform distribution thereof. Thereafter, the wet film is formed and dried. Coating or casting methods are particularly useful for the purpose of forming the films of the present invention. Specific examples include reverse roll coating, gravure coating, immersion or dip coating, metering rod or meyer bar coating, slot die or extrusion coating, gap or knife over roll coating, air knife coating, curtain coating, or combinations thereof, especially when a multi-layered film is desired. Roll coating, or more specifically reverse roll coating, is particularly desired when forming films in accordance with the present invention. This procedure provides excellent control and uniformity of the resulting films, which is desired in the present invention. In this procedure, the coating material is measured onto the applicator roller by the precision setting of the gap between the upper metering roller and the application roller below it. The coating is transferred from the application roller to the substrate as it passes around the support roller adjacent to the application roller. Both three roll and four roll processes are common. The gravure coating process relies on an engraved roller running in a coating bath, which fills the engraved dots or lines of the roller with the coating material. The excess coating on the roller is wiped off by a doctor blade and the coating is then deposited onto the substrate as it passes between the engraved roller and a pressure roller. Offset Gravure is common, where the coating is deposited on an intermediate roller before transfer to the substrate. In the simple process of immersion or dip coating, the substrate is dipped into a bath of the coating, which is normally of a low viscosity to enable the coating to run back into the bath as the substrate emerges. In the metering rod coating process, an excess of the coating is deposited onto the substrate as it passes over the bath roller. The wire-wound metering rod, sometimes known as a Meyer Bar, allows the desired quantity of the coating to remain on the substrate. The quantity is determined by the diameter of the wire used on the rod. In the slot die process, the coating is squeezed out by gravity or under pressure through a slot and onto the substrate. If the coating is 100% solids, the process is termed "Extrusion" and in this case, the line speed is frequently much faster than the speed of the extrusion. This enables coatings to be considerably thinner than the width of the slot. The gap or knife over roll process relies on a coating being applied to the substrate which then passes through a "gap" between a "knife" and a support roller. As the coating and substrate pass through, the excess is scraped off. Air knife coating is where the coating is applied to the substrate and the excess is "blown off" by a powerful jet from the air knife. This procedure is useful for aqueous coatings. In the curtain coating process, a bath with a slot in the base allows a continuous curtain of the coating to fall into the gap between two conveyors. The object to be coated is passed along the conveyor at a controlled speed and so receives the coating on its upper face. Drying the Film The drying step can also be a contributing factor with regard to maintaining the uniformity of the film composition. A controlled drying process is particularly important when, in the absence of a viscosity increasing composition or a composition in which the viscosity is controlled, for example by the selection of the polymer, the components within the film may have an increased tendency to aggregate or conglomerate. An alternative method of forming a film with an accurate dosage, that would not necessitate the controlled drying process, would be to cast the films on a predetermined well. With this method, although the components may aggregate, this will not result in the migration of the active to an adjacent dosage form, since each well may define the dosage unit per se. One process used to make the films is described in U.S. Patent Number 7,425,292, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. In this process, the films are prepared by rapidly forming a visco-elastic film by applying hot air currents to the film to prevent flow migration and intermolecular forces from creating aggregates or conglomerates thereby maintaining compositional uniform distribution of components in the film; and further drying the visco-elastic film to form a self-supporting film. The wet film forming matrix first may be fed onto the top side of a surface prior to the application of hot air currents. The wet film is desirably formed from a deaerated matrix within a time period before the active contained therein degrades. The process may further include a step of dividing the dried film into individual dosage units of equal dimensions and compositional make-up. There may be hot air currents applied to the top surface, if desired. In such embodiments, it may be desired that hot air currents be applied to the bottom surface of the film at a higher velocity than to the top surface of the film during drying. Hot air currents applied to dry the top of the films are preferably less than that which would cause surface rippling or skinning. This permits the film to sufficiently thicken in viscosity to lock-in volumetric uniformity while permitting evaporation of water through the non-skinned surface. When a controlled or rapid drying process is used, liquid carriers are removed from the film in a manner such that the uniformity, or more specifically, the non-self-aggregating uniform heterogeneity, that is obtained in the wet film is maintained. Desirably, the film is rapidly dried, such that a solid, visco-elastic structure is initially formed and the contents of the film are "locked in". This can take place within the first few minutes, e.g. about the first 0.5 to about 15 minutes, desirably about the first 10 minutes, and most desirably about the first 4.0 minutes of the drying process. This rapid drying may be achieved by increasing the viscosity of the film at the initiation of the drying process, such as by initially exposing the film to a drying source, such as heat or radiation energy. Rapid drying means that the film product's viscosity begins to develop at the initiation of the drying process to lock in the uniformity of the active content as described above. The rapid increase in viscosity is achieved at the initial stage of drying because the initial rate of heat transfer in the film should be sufficiently high in order to achieve the visco-elastic film formation. It may be desired to limit the amount of top air flow during this initial drying stage. Controlling the drying in this manner prevents the destruction and reformation of the film's top surface, which results from conventional drying methods. This is accomplished by forming the film and placing it on the top side of a surface having top and bottom sides. Then, heat is initially applied to the bottom side of the film to provide the necessary energy to evaporate or otherwise remove the liquid carrier. The films dried in this manner dry more quickly and evenly as compared to air-dried films, or those dried by conventional drying means. In contrast to an air-dried film that dries first at the top and edges, the films dried by applying heat to the bottom dry simultaneously at the center as well as at the edges. This also prevents settling of ingredients that occurs with films dried by conventional means. The internal temperature of the film forming matrix during drying is desirably about 100°C or less, desirably about 70°C or less, and most desirably about 60°C or less. It may be desired to dry the film such that the temperature within the film is less than the boiling point of any solvent or solvents that are within the film forming matrix. Further, it is desirable that the temperature within the film forming matrix is maintained below a temperature at which substantial degradation of actives contained within the film will occur. It is noted, however, that the temperature outside of the film may be above the temperature within the film, and in some instances may be substantially higher than the temperature within the film. The interior of the film remains at a temperature below which substantial degradation of the active contained therein occurs. It is generally understood that some degradation of the active may occur, but such degradation should not be of a substantial amount such that the uniformity of the non-degraded active content is outside the uniformity levels set forth above. That is, unit doses cut from the film should not vary from each other or from the target level of active by about 10% of viable, non-degraded active content. Another method of controlling the drying process, which may be used alone or in combination with other controlled methods as disclosed above includes controlling and modifying the humidity within the drying apparatus where the film is being dried. In this manner, the premature drying of the top surface of the film may be avoided. Another method of drying tracks that previously set forth by Magoon, which is based on an interesting property of water. Although water transmits energy by conduction and convection both within and to its surroundings, water only radiates energy within and to water. Therefore, the apparatus of Magoon includes a surface onto which the fruit pulp is placed that is transparent to infrared radiation. The underside of the surface is in contact with a temperature controlled water bath. The water bath temperature is desirably controlled at a temperature slightly below the boiling temperature of water. When the wet fruit pulp is placed on the surface of the apparatus, this creates a "refractance window." This means that infrared energy is permitted to radiate through the surface only to the area on the surface occupied by the fruit pulp, and only until the fruit pulp is dry. The apparatus of Magoon provides the films of the present invention with an efficient drying time reducing the instance of aggregation of the components of the film. The objective of the drying processes described herein is to provide a method of drying the films that avoids complications, such as the noted "rippling" effect, that are associated with conventional drying methods and which initially dry the upper surface of the film, trapping moisture inside. In conventional oven drying methods, as the moisture trapped inside subsequently evaporates, the top surface is altered by being ripped open and then reformed. These complications are avoided by the present drying methods, and a uniform film is provided by drying the bottom surface of the film first or otherwise preventing the formation of polymer film formation (skin) on the top surface of the film prior to drying the depth of the film. This may be achieved by applying heat as described above, or alternatively by the introduction of radiation (such as controlled microwaves) to evaporate the water or other polar solvent within the film. In some embodiments, the film is rapidly dried so as to form a visco-elastic structure within the first ten minutes of drying, and more particularly within the first four minutes of drying. Desirably, the film is dried at such a rapid rate that any components, including the nanoparticles, do not undesirably aggregate together. By rapidly drying the wet matrix, a substantial number of the nanoparticles do not have time to agglomerate. Yet alternatively, drying may be achieved by using balanced fluid flow, such as balanced air flow, where the bottom and top air flows are controlled to provide a uniform film. In such a case, the air flow directed at the top of the film should not create a condition which would cause movement of particles present in the wet film, due to forces generated by the air currents, that is, any top air flow that is present during this drying stage should be insufficient to overcome the inherent viscosity of the film surface. Additionally, any air currents directed at the bottom of the film should desirably be controlled such that the film does not lift up due to forces from the air. There may be more top air currents than bottom air currents, so long as the air currents are controlled so as to avoid skinning, rippling, or movement of particles within the matrix that results in undesirable agglomeration or non-uniformity. Uncontrolled air currents, either above or below the film, can create non-uniformity in the final film products. The humidity level of the area surrounding the top surface may also be appropriately adjusted to prevent premature closure or skinning of the polymer surface. The present invention yields exceptionally uniform film products when attention is paid to reducing the aggregation of the compositional components. By avoiding the introduction of and eliminating excessive air in the mixing process, selecting polymers and solvents to provide a controllable viscosity and by drying the film in a rapid manner from the bottom up, such films result. Various drying methods include those set forth in U.S. Patent Nos. 7,425,292 and 7,357,891, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. The films may initially have a thickness of about 500 pm to about 1,500 pm, or about 20 mils to about 60 mils, and when dried have a thickness from about 3 pm to about 250 pm, or about 0.1 mils to about 10 mils. In some embodiments, the film product has a thickness of greater than 0.1 mils. In some other embodiments, the film product has a thickness of about 10 mils or fewer. In some further embodiments, the film product has a thickness of about 0.5 mils to about 5 mils. Desirably, the dried films will have a thickness of about 2 mils to about 8 mils, and more desirably, from about 3 mils to about 6 mils. Extruding the Film Composition In alternative embodiments, the film products of the present invention may be formed by extrusion rather than casting or deposition methods. Extrusion is particularly useful for film compositions containing polyethylene oxide-based polymer components, as discussed below. For instance, a single screw extrusion process may be employed in accordance with the present invention. According to such an extrusion process, pressure builds in the polymer melt so that it may be extruded through a die or injected into a mold. It may be particularly desirable to employ extrusion methods for forming film compositions containing ΡΕΟ polymer components. These compositions contain ΡΕΟ or ΡΕΟ blends in the polymer component, and may be essentially free of added plasticizers, and/or surfactants, and polyalcohols. The compositions may be extruded as a sheet at processing temperatures of less than about 90°C. Extrusion may proceed by squeezing the film composition through rollers or a die to obtain a uniform matrix. The extruded film composition then is cooled by any mechanism known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, chill rollers, air cooling beds, or water cooling beds may be employed. The cooling step is particularly desirable for film compositions containing ΡΕΟ polymer components because ΡΕΟ tends to hold heat. The thus formed sheets can be formed into various shapes, as desired. Uses of Thin Films The thin films of the present invention are well suited for many uses. The high degree of uniformity of the components of the film makes them particularly well suited for incorporating pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the polymers used in construction of the films may be chosen to allow for a range of disintegration times for the films. A variation or extension in the time over which a film will disintegrate may achieve control over the rate that the active is released, which may allow for a sustained release delivery system. In addition, the films may be used for the administration of nanoparticles to skin and other body surfaces, including those with mucous membranes. The films may be used to administer nanoparticles through topical, oral, or any other administration desired. The films may also be reconstituted in a suitable liquid carrier and subsequently administered by injection or infusion. Administration may be accomplished by preparing the film as described above, introducing the film to a skin or mucosal surface of a mammal, and wetting the film if necessary, for example. If desired, this film may be prepared and adhered to a second or support layer from which it is removed prior to use, i.e. application to the skin. An adhesive may be used to attach the film to the support or backing material, which may be any of those known in the art, and is preferably not water soluble. If an adhesive is used, it will desirably be an adhesive that does not alter the properties of the active. Mucoadhesive compositions are also useful. The film compositions in many cases serve as mucoadhesives themselves. The films of the present invention take advantage of the films' tendency to dissolve quickly when wetted, i.e., through contact with a wetting agent such as water or saliva. The nanoparticles may be introduced to a liquid by preparing a film in accordance with the present invention, introducing it to a liquid, and allowing the film to dissolve. This may be used to prepare a liquid dosage form of the nanoparticles, which may then be administered to the user. The following is presented by way of example and is not to be construed as a limitation to the scope of the claims.

NP-alpha-Gal(1)EG6NH2(1) Preparation of amine alpha-gal gold nanoparticles Batch MI-NP-10-AMINE-GAL: To a mix of amine-mercapto hexaethylenglycol linker 6 and alpha-galactose ligand 3 in a ratio 1:1 (0.58 mmol, 3 eq.) in Μ℮ΟΗ (49 mL) was added an aqueous solution of gold salt (7.86 mL, 0.19 mmol, 0.025Μ). The reaction was stirred during 30 seconds and then, an aqueous solution of NaBH4 (IN) was added in several portions (4.32 mL, 4.32 mmol). The reaction was shaken for 100 minutes at 900 rpm. After this time, the suspension was centrifuged 1 minute at 14000 rpm. The supernatant is removed and the precipitated was dissolved in 2 mL of water. Then, 2 mL of the suspension were introduced in two filters (AMICON, 10 KDa, 4 mL) and were centrifuged 5 minutes at 4500g. The residue in the filter was washed twice more with water. The final residue was dissolved in 80 mL of water. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, a schematic representation of the resulting nanoparticles having a plurality of ligands in the ratio 1:1 of alpha-Gal:EG6NH2 "NP-alpha- Gal (1)EG6NH2(1)" is shown in Figure 11. For the preparation of gold NPs manufacture was under laminar flow cabinet. All glass and plastic material (such as eppendorfs, vials and bottles) and solvent (water, HAc) were first sterilized in an autoclave. All other disposables (such as tips and filters) came pre-sterilized. Example 3 - Insulin binding to nanoparticles The following method details how the binding of insulin to alphaGal(l) EG6NH2(1) NPs was performed. The method used fixed insulin and variable ΝΡ levels, lower/different levels of ΝΡ were used for the other ΝΡ samples tested, but with this exception the method was the same for all NPs tested. Preparation of insulin stock solution; weight 20mg human insulin into a clean glass vial and add 8.7ml lOmM HC1 mix gently insulin will dissolve completely, then pH back to 7.5 by adding 1.3ml lOOmM Tris base, the solution will go cloudy briefly as the insulin passes through its isoelectric point, check the pH is 7.5 and store capped at 4“C, this is the 2mg/ml insulin stock solution. Add variable amounts of alphaGal(l) EG6NH2(1) NPs to an eppendorf or suitably sized vessel, for example; 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 480 nmoles gold content of ΝΡ, make up to a total volume of 200μ1 with water, then add 50μ1 of human insulin (2mg/ml in tris HC1 ρΗ7.5 see above for preparation of insulin stock solution). Mix gently and leave at room temp for 2h, follow with a 2 minute bench spin (2000rpm) to bring down the aggregate. A standard tube which has just 200μ1 water and 50 μ1 insulin should be performed to give the maximum supernatant value, as should a blank i.e. 50μ1 Tris HC1 ρΗ7.5 + 200μ1 water. If high accuracy is required a sample containing a known amount of alphaGal(l) EG6NH2(1) ΝΡ i.e. 10μg gold content is made up to 200μ1 with water, and 50μ1 of the insulin buffer added (Tris HC1 ρΗ7.5), this can be used to correct for the slight positive result the alphaGal(l) EG6NH2(1) ΝΡ gives in the BCA assay see below*. Assay the supernatants, 20μ1 in triplicate by standard micro BCA assay (Pierce kit 23235), this will give data showing how much insulin remains in supernatant. By subtracting this value from the value for the insulin only standard calculate the amount of ΝΡ bound insulin, it can also be expressed as a percent if required. The data obtained here shows the amount of alphaGal(l) EG6NH2(1)-ΝΡ that if required to maximally bind the lOC^g of insulin used, these conditions can be scaled up to produce the amount alphaGal(l) EG6NH2(1)-NP-insulin required. *The data can be correcting for the slight interference of the free alphaGal(l) EG6NH2(1)-ΝΡ in the BCA assay. To do this perform a gold analysis on all the final samples and calculate how much gold remains in the various supernatants, higher levels will be seen in samples with an excess of ΝΡ to insulin. Use the BCA value for the 10 μg gold content ΝΡ to correct relative to the gold content seen, as demonstrated by the following example: If the 10 μg gold content ΝΡ without insulin gives 0.5 by BCA and 40 pg Au test ΝΡ supernatant gives BCA of 1.25, and also shows gold content of 5μg, that means 0.25 of BCA value (50% of 0.5) is actually due to the free ΝΡ, hence corrected value for 40 μg gold test ΝΡ supernatant should be 1.00 not 1.25. This is a simplified, illustrative example, the correction factor will be minimal where the gold content in the supernatant is low. The amount of human insulin bound (in nmoles) per amount of gold (in nmoles) is shown in Figure 12, wherein: Glc = 2'-thioethyl-3~D-glucopyranoside; GlcNAc = 2'-thioethyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy- p-D-glucopyranoside; GlcaminelAA = 5'-thiopentanyl-2-deoxy-2-imidazolacetamido- α,β-Dglucopyranoside (alpha, beta mix of isomers); AGal = 2'-thioethyl-a-D-galactopyranoside; EG6NH2 = l-amino-17-mercapto-3,6,9,12,15,-pentaoxa-heptadecanol; AGlc = 2'-thioethyl-a-D-glucopyranoside; and The numbers in the legend refer to the ligand stiochiometry. As can be seen by reference to Figure 12, a relatively high degree of insulin binding was obtained using nanoparticles having a corona of AGal and EG6NH2 in approximately 1:1 ratio. Insulin binding was also exhibited by nanoparticles having any of the following corona compositions: AGal: EG6NH2 1:1 ( Trace 11 Figure 12) Glc:GlcaminelAA 1:1 (Trace 10 Figure 12) AGlc: EG6NH2 1:1 ( Trace 8 Figure 12) BGlc: EG6NH2 1:1 (Trace 6 Figure 12) GlcNAc: EG6NH2 1:1 (Trace 7 Figure 12). The insulin bound to nanoparticles as described herein was found to be releasable upon contact with a physiological solution (e.g. a saline solution) and was found to be detectable such that a positive result was achieved in an ELISA for (human) insulin. These results indicate that insulin-bound nanoparticles of the invention provide insulin in a form that is available for interaction with biological systems and/or components. Thus, the nanoparticles are capable of acting as a carrier/stabiliser of insulin (e.g. for storage and/or processing for incorporation into, e.g., a pharmaceutical product) whilst also maintaining the ability to present or make available insulin (for example, monomeric insulin) to exert its biological effects, for example following delivery to a subject, organ or cell thereof. Example 4 - Characterisation of nanoparticles I) Characterization of insulin gold nanoparticles batch MI-NP-10-Ins (NP-alpha-Gal(1)EG6NH2(1)) a) Gold content: The gold content was determined using a method based on the formation of a coloured complex between ethopropazine and the gold after complete oxidation to Au(III). The absorbance of the sample is measured at 513 nm and quantitatively compared to similar solutions having a known amount of gold. The gold content was determined to be (batch # ΝΡ10): 262.5 ± 56.3 mg/L. ΤΕΜ: a transmission electron microscopy (ΤΕΜ) image of the nanoparticle suspension is shown in Figure 13. The sample was determined to have the following size characteristics for the gold core: Count = 783 Mean (diameter) = 2.323 nm ± 0.716 nm Min. = 1.002 nm Max. = 4.859 nm Mode = 2.104 nm d) Size distribution by Dynamic Light Scattering: number and volume distributions were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) for MI-NP-10 amine-gal (i.e. NP-alpha-Gal(1)EG6NH2(1) nanoparticles), and are shown in Figure 14 A and Β, respectively. The peak value for the peak shown in Figure 14Α is as follows: Peak 1 4.875 nm The peak value for the peak shown in Figure 14Β is as follows: Peak 1 5.289 nm III) Final preparation of insulin gold nanoparticles Batch MI-NP-10-INS . A solution of gold nanoparticles MI-NP-10 ( 13.041 mg gold) was made up to 49.68 mL of water. To the final solution was added acetic acid to obtain a ρΗ=4.6. Then, 55.7 mg of human insulin in 27.85 mL of Tris.HCl pH 7.5 was added. The suspension was left 24 hours and after this time, was centrifuged 1 minute at 4500g. The supernatant was removed and stored for further insulin and gold content analysis. The precipitate was resuspended in 3.220 mL of water to get a final insulin concentration of 500 units insulin/mL. The size distribution of the insulin-gold nanoparticles was determined by DLS analysis. The insulin content was determined by BCA standard assay. ** The final preparation of insulin gold ΝΡ was manufactured under laminar flow cabinet. All glass and plastic material (such as eppendorfs and bottles) and solvent (such as water, TrisHCl and HAc) used were sterilized in an autoclave. All other disposables (such as tips and filters) came pre-sterilized. Characterisation: a) Size distribution by Dynamic Light Scattering is shown by number and volume in Figure 15 A, and Β, respectively for MI-NP-10-INS (amine-gal-INSULIN nanoparticles). The peak value for the peak shown in Figure 15Α is as follows: Peak 1 68.46 nm The peak value for the peak shown in Figure 15Β is as follows: Peak 1 88.38 nm b) Insulin content: The % of insulin binding to the nanoparticles was determined by the following formula: „. , insulin added - insulin supernatant , „. % insulin = χ 100 insulin added Table 2 - Insulin content Sample Insulin added (mg) Insulin supernatant (mg) Insulin bound (mg) % insulin bound MI-NP-10 insulin 55.700 1.308 54.4 97.65 Concentration of insulin and gold in NP-insulin nanoparticles: Insulin: 55.7 mg Insulin Gold: 13.041 mg of gold Total volume: 3.23 mL water Final insulin concentration: 17.25 mg insulin/mL= 500 units/mL Final gold concentration: 4.037 mg Au/mL. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the present inventors consider the following: 102 Au atoms/NP, for which the mathematical result is 14 insulin molecules attached to 1 ΝΡ. Since geometrical considerations allow space for about 7 insulin molecules on the surface of the nanoparticle, these results suggest that each ΝΡ contains 7 insulin dimer units. Further characterisation of the insulin gold nanoparticles Batch MI-NP-10-INS yielded the following results. Final insulin concentration: 17.25 mg insulin/mL = 500 U/mL, determined by colorimetric bicinchonicic acid assay after calibration against insulin standardized solutions of known concentrations. Final gold concentration: 4.037 mg Au/mL, determined by colorimetric assay with ethopropazine assay after calibration against gold standardized solutions of known concentrations. Total volume: 3.23 mL in MilliQ water. After geometrical considerations, one a-galactose-EG-amine-Au nanoparticle contains a gold core with 102 atoms. Then: 4.037 mg = 2.049℮-5 moles = 1.234℮19 atoms = 1.21℮17 nanoparticles 17.25 mg = 2.97℮-6 moles = 1.789℮18 molecules Therefore one a-galactose- EG6NH2-Au nanoparticle is bound to about between 14 and 15 insulin molecules to produce the final nanoparticle. Results from thermogravimetric analysis: Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the present inventors consider that for insulin-NP we have 500 ug of dry weight in which 410 ug is decomposed. Therefore the percent organic is 82%. Considering 102 atoms of gold in one a-galactose- EG6NH2-Au nanoparticle, gold weight would be 20091 (18%) and an organic corona 12122. Therefore to have a particle that is 82% organic it must have weight of 111616 that is 91525 organic. Since 12122 of organic is corona that leaves about 79403 of the organic as insulin. Since insulin has MW 5808 then we must have 14 moles insulin per particle. Figure 16 shows the experimental thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data. Example 5 - Ζη optimisation of insulin binding Gold nanoparticles (NPs), alphaGal(l) EG6NH2(1) NPs, were prepared as described in Example 2 above. In order to evaluate the influence of Ζη on insulin binding to the NPs, a first batch of NPs was synthesised in the absence of Ζη. A second batch of NPs was synthesised in the presence of 1.33 equivalents of Ζη. A third batch of NPs was synthesised in the absence of Ζη, but had 1.33 equivalents of ZnCl2 added to the NPs post-synthesis. The binding of human insulin to the three batches of gold NPs was then measured. The results are shown in Figure 17. Figure 17 displays a Graph showing the amount of fixed 17.2 nmoles of Insulin binding to varying gold ΝΡ concentrations. Comparison of ΝΡ synthesised without Ζη, a ΝΡ with synthesised with 1.33 eq, and Ζη free NPs with 1.33 eq of ZnC12. The graph in Figure 17 shows that with no zinc present insulin binding is at a very low level. When zinc is present insulin binding is significantly higher up to quantitative. Equivalent insulin binding occurs whether the zinc is present during ΝΡ synthesis or whether it is added post synthesis. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the present inventors believe that the Zn2+ cation provides improved insulin binding to the gold NPs. Other forms of Ζη, such as ΖηΟ may also mediate improved insulin binding. In particular, presence of ΖηΟ in gold ΝΡ sample that had been stored for a period of months indicates that ΖηΟ can form and may additionally or alternatively to Zn2+ cation mediate or facilitate improved insulin binding to the NPs. The importance of Zn2+ in insulin crystallisation, form and function has been reported previously. However, data described herein indicate that insulin bound to NPs, including in the presence of Zn2+, is in monomeric or dimeric form rather than the hexameric form more commonly associated with human insulin in the presence of Zn2+ (i.e. insulin not bound to NPs). This may present a considerable advantage in relation to the present invention because monomeric or dimeric insulin is preferred in many settings (e.g. clinical settings) as compared with hexameric insulin. The present inventors have found that binding of GLP-1 to gold NPs (described herein) takes place the presence of Ζη (including, but not limited to Zn2+ and/or ΖηΟ). GLP-1 binding to gold NPs described herein was to NPs synthesised in the presence of Ζη. It is specifically contemplated herein that Ζη may be present in GLP-1-bound gold nanoparticle compositions. Example 6 - GLP-1 Binding to Gold Nanoparticles Gold nanoparticles (NPs), alphaGal(l) EG6NH2{1) NPs, were prepared as described in Example 2 above. Rather than adding insulin, GLP-1 was added. It was found that GLP-1 binds to the NPs. The binding of a fixed 29.8 nmoles of GLP-1 to varying gold ΝΡ concentrations is shown in Figure 18. These results demonstrate that a peptide other than insulin binds to the nanoparticles of the invention. Example 7 - Nanoparticles co-binding more than one protein: combination insulin/GLP-1 nanoparticles Gold nanoparticles (NPs), alphaGal(l) EG6NH2(1) NPs, were prepared as described in Example 2 above. Insulin and GLP-1 were both added to the NPs. An aqueous solution of the GLP-l/Insulin NPs was subjected to analysis by MALDI and the results are shown in Figure 19. The GLP-l/Insulin NPs were subjected to HPLC and the trace is shown in Figure 20. The HPLC data show that 19.8 mg of insulin was measured and 1.33 mg of GLP-1. The binding reaction was performed using a 1:1 molar ratio of insulin and GLP-1. The HPLC data show that the approximate ratio of insulin:GLP-1 was 9:1 indicating preferential binding of the insulin relative to GLP-1 to the nanoparticle coronal surface. The MALDI and HPLC data demonstrate the mixed binding of GLP-1 and Insulin to gold nanoparticles. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, the present inventors believe that co-binding of two or more different species of peptide to the nanoparticle of the invention may be preferred in certain settings (e.g. certain clinical settings) as compared with binding of a single species of peptide. In particular, combinations of peptides may be carried on a nanoparticle such that the peptides perform mutually beneficial functions and/or act in concert, such as in a synergistic fashion. Example 8 - in vivo treatment of minipigs with insulin-carrying nanoparticles, GLP-1-carrying nanoparticles, mixtures thereof and combination insulin/GLP-1 nanoparticles In order to explore further the monomeric release characteristics of NP-insulin, constructs of insulin and GLP-1 were synthesized. We have proposed that GLP-1 is immediately removed from the plasma via receptors (rather than enzymatic degradation) and that the pharmacodynamics (PD) effect of GLP-1 will, like insulin, be temporally and quantitatively unrelated to the pharmacokinetics (ΡΚ), which is thought to be just minutes. We have previously used NP-insulin to provide a source of monomer insulin for receptor blockade ten minutes before IVG stimulated release of endogenous monomeric insulin. The ΡΚ of endogenous insulin through the 1st phase and 2nd phase was then visualized. We have also used Novo Rapid entrainment to block insulin receptors and measure the ΡΚ of NP-insulin. In this study we have used the co-administration of ΝΡ-GLP-1 along with the administration of NP-insulin to provide a pancreatic insulinotropic effect and to the reduce the clearance rate of both endogenously released insulin and exogenous NP-insulin in response to IVG. The ΡΚ of both the endogenous released and exogenous NP-insulin were measured. The ΡΚ and PD of NP-insulin, a combination nanoparticle having both insulin and GLP-1 loaded on the same nanoparticle (NP-insulin/GLP-1 - see Example 7 for details of preparation) and a mixture preparation of NP-insulin and NP-GLP-1 were assessed using healthy female minipigs. Surface analysis showed that single NP-insulin particles have ~16 moles insulin/particle and NP-insulin/GLP-1 particles have ~26moles insulin/particle. Analysis of the NP-insulin/GLP-1 nanoparticles as shown in Figure 21 revealed a molar ratio of insulin to GLP-1 on the same particle was 9/1. The administered dose of insulin was 2.5U/animal and the dose of GLP-1 was O.lnmol/kg (average wt. 19kg) either using a single particle or mixing NP-insulin particles and NP-GLP-1 particles to give a molar ratio of 9/1 for insulin/GLP-1. This stoichiometry provides the opportunity to deliver a therapeutic dose of both insulin and GLP-1 on a single particle. Animals were fasted overnight and then placed under anaesthesia. After 120 minutes a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of the test items was administered in water vehicle and 10 minutes later an intraveneous glucose (IVG) challenge of 0.33gm/kg was administered intravenous. Blood was sampled at intervals and measurements of insulin, glucose, C-peptide and glucagon recorded. The IVG was required since exogenously administered GLP-1 only stimulates pancreatic insulintropic actions in the presence of hyperglycaemia. Further, IVG doesn't result in endogenous release of GLP-1 from intestinal L cells since a plasma/portal glucose differential which is required for endogenous release, is not present after systemic administration of glucose. This contrasts with an oral glucose test which will induce endogenous GLP-1. GLP-1 has also been shown to increase plasma insulin levels by decreasing the catabolic rate of plasma insulin. For hormones with short half-lives this can have a rapid and significant effect on plasma levels. Direct insulinotropic effects have also been proposed based on studies with isolated pancreatic islets but the mechanism in vivo has not been definitively established. Extrapancreatic effects of exogenous GLP-1 will be present in either oral glucose test (OGT) or IVG protocols. Reduction in blood glucose levels after oral glucose tolerance tests has been proposed to be secondary to reduced gastric emptying but this action of GLP-1 has recently been challenged and nausea may be implicated in the effect. Clarification of the mechanism of action of exogenous administered native GLP-1 can not necessarily be extrapolated from studies on the exendin analogues or GLP-1 protease inhibitors. In the present experimental protocol the test items were given prior to the glucose challenge and therefore models a potential pharmacodynamics (PD) effect on a subsequent glucose load - i.e. pre-meal treatment of diabetics. Figure 22 shows the PD of glucose clearance for the NP-insulin and NP-insulin/GLP-1 particles. The data demonstrate that the magnitude of the glucose Cmax was reduced by almost 50% for the combination NP-insulin/GLP-1 as compared with treatment using the NP-insulin preparation. The blunting of the Cmax is a characteristic of cephalic phase insulin release and may indicate an increase in volume of distribution (Vd). GLP-1 is known to reduce AV glucose differences and this effect may therefore promote glucose entering interstitial space more efficiently where the target organs of muscle and liver (space of Disse) can dispose of the glucose. PET scans of FDG in normal and diabetic patients after insulin injection has demonstrated liver and muscle to be the main target organs with abnormal enhanced accumulation in muscle in diabetics, in contrast in normal individuals almost all the glucose is removed by the liver. The ability of NP-insulin/GLP-1 to reduce the magnitude of the glucose Cmax in response to a glucose challenge indicates that the "glucose excursion" is relatively normalised compared with the large glucose excursion that is typically exhibited by diabetic patients in response to a glucose challenge. This indicates that the NP-insulin/GLP-1 addresses a key feature of the diabetic condition: the regulation of the glucose excursion in response to a glucose challenge (see Bagger et al., 2011, J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., Vol. 96(3), ρρ. 737-745, the entire contents of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference). This is expected to be of therapeutic benefit. The inventors presently believe that ΝΡ-insulin/GLP-1 may advantageously regulate the "incretin effect" such that the glucose excursion in a treated diabetic following a glucose challenge is reduced to, or close to the normal, non-diabetic, range of around 2 times baseline blood glucose concentration. Figures 23 and 24 show the data plotted from 6 minutes after IVG (1 minute after the end of the 5 minute square wave infusion). The pre-treatment with the NP-insulin had a dramatic effect on the initial clearance of the glucose (vascular compartment 1) with a half-life of l.lmin. The second clearance half-life was 42min for the interstitial space elimination (compartment 2). The presence of GLP-1 on the same particle had the effect of dramatically damping the Cmax (glucose excursion) and the two compartment model could not be used and the data could only be fit to a single exponential giving a calculated half-life of 28 min. Figure 25 shows the PD data for mixing two particles containing insulin or GLP-1 (that is the insulin and GLP-1 were on separate particles). Again a significant damping of the Cmax is observed and the majority of the glucose is cleared with a half-life of ~29 min which was similar to the particle containing both insulin and GLP-1. Figure 26 compares the three test items in the same pigs. Both GLP-1 containing test items dampened the Cmax of the glucose square-wave infusion, confirming this unique PD effect of the GLP-1. Reduction of glucose excursion is critical in the treatment of type II diabetes and as far as we are aware this has not previously been reported for free GLP-1 or the acylated analogues. GLP-1 has recently been shown to reduce water intake and if the effects we observe are due to Vd redistribution these two observation could be linked. Figures 27 and 28 show the glucagon levels after administration of NP-insulin and NP-insulin/GLP-1 in individual animals. As we have found previously in the absence of an IVG, subcutaneous (s.c.) NP-insulin has a dramatic effect on maintaining the anaesthesia induced suppression of glucagon. In contrast (Figure 28) the NP-insulin/GLP-1 particles increased glucagon levels in all animals during the first ten minutes after sc injection. A rapid drop in levels immediately followed the IVG at the ten minute point and then elevated levels returned as the glucose levels returned to normal glycaemia. In Figure 29 the data is plotted as the mean of the percent change in order to normalize for different starting values. Since none of the animals in the study had hypoglycaemia (Figure 26), the differences in glucagon response must be a measure of the balanace between the counter-hormones required to maintain normal glycaemia rather than a response to hypoglycaemia. These data suggest that the glucose ΡΚ shown in Figure 24 for the ΝΡ-insulin/GLP-1 is a balance of the strong glucose lowering action of the NP-insulin which was being counter-acted by the glucose elevating potential of the glucagon. A characteristic of some rapid-acting insulin is to drive hypoglycaemia without a clear counter-hormone response in anesthetised minipigs. The addition of the GLP-1 component to NP-insulin appears to provide a counter-hormone response even in this protocol. As reported in Figure 27, we found almost undetectable levels of glucagon after the IVG but these were significantly raised by the administration of the NP-insulin/GLP-1 as shown in Figure 28. Figure 30 shows the effect of administering the insulin and GLP-1 on separate particles compared to the NP-insulin/GLP-1 combination. For both test items an initial spike of glucagon was measured followed by a rapid decline and then post IVG an elevation of glucagon levels were significantly elevated for the NP-insulin/GLP-1 particles. This indicates that the NP-insulin/GLP-1 treatment induces a more normal glucagon response (also known as counter-hormone response) as compared with the mixture of NP-insulin and NP-GLP-1. This suggests that the NP-insulin/GLP-1 combination may avoid or minimize any undesirable hypoglycaemia. This experiment provides preliminary evidence that administering the insulin and GLP-1 on the same particle results in a different PD effect from administering two particles with either GLP-1 or insulin attached. The release rate of the GLP-1 and insulin is rapid in plasma but it would perhaps be expected that some of the ΝΡ insulin and GLP-1 remains associated with the particle during at least one circulation. Under this condition either the insulin or the GLP-1 could be acting as a homing molecule such that delivery of the insulin and GLP-1 are to the same target. For example the fate of most administered insulin is the pancreas and therefore this could result in targeting of the GLP-1 to that compartment. In contrast GLP-1 predominantly cleared by the kidney and like insulin is localized to the pancreas and this could result in insulin/GLP-1 delivery to the pancreas but different histological sites. Figure 31 shows the C-peptide response to the IVG after administration of the sc NP-insulin. Insulin doesn't suppress insulin synthesis and the C-peptide levels, in principle, reflect the glucose stimulus to the pancreas and release of endogenous insulin. Figure 32 shows the individual responses for the same pigs administered NP-insulin/GLP-1. No clear insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 was observed when it is attached to the same particle as insulin, as shown in Figure 32 except possibly for pig 3. In Figure 33 no difference in C-peptide synthesis is seen between the NP-insulin and NP-insulin/GLP-1. In contrast, the administration of the insulin and GLP-1 on separate particles has resulted in an insulinotropic effect. This suggests that the NP-insulin/GLP-1 combination advantageously avoids or reduces a GLP-1 induced insulinotropic effect in a subject as compared with the NP-insulin and NP-GLP-1 mixture. The expected GLP-1 insulinotropic response is therefore not observed when the GLP-1 is attached to a particle which also contains insulin. This is further evidence of insulin targeting of the GLP-1. It is controversial but the direct pancreatic effects of GLP-1 may be a counter indication of GLP-1 therapy since pancreatitis and pancreatic tumours have now been reported. The ability to deliver GLP-1 and avoid the insulinotropic activity in the pancreas is a potentially important characteristic of NP-insulin/GLP-1 constructs. The strong insulinotropic effect is also clearly seen in the insulin ΡΚ measurements as shown in Figure 34 which shows the data for pigs when treated with a mixture of particles and Figure 34 shows that the composite picture of the endogenous insulin release which has been enhanced by the insulinotropic action of GLP-1 and the exogenous NP-insulin which was administered s.c. From the entrainment experiments we know that the pre-treatment of the animals ten minutes prior to the IVG induced receptor blockade and we can observe predominantly the ΡΚ of endogenously produced monomeric insulin. Figure 35 shows the insulin ΡΚ after using the NP-insulin/GLP-1. Figure 36 shows the effect of an intravenous infusion of NP-GLP-1 compared to control and free GLP-1 simultaneous with a glucose infusion. Under these conditions GLP-1 is thought to enhance the 1st and 2nd phase response by either an insulinotropic effect or by enhancing insulin Cmax by reducing the clearance or degradation of insulin. This confirms that the NP-insulin/GLP particles are providing the stabilization activity of GLP-1 (peak around 10-12 minutes) but not the insulintropic effect which is evident post 50-75 minutes, as shown in Figure 34.. The insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 is controversial since it is difficult to explain how endogenous GLP-1 is able to anatomically reach the pancreas prior to it being degraded. GLP-1 is also thought to be released into lymphatics that make its biodistribution more difficult to predict. Analogue GLP-ls have longer plasma half-lives and clearly would be able to reach the pancreas and have an insulinotropic effect, however, this action may be associated with abnormal physiology such as overstimulation of islets cell and pancreatitis. It is clear that the NP-insulin/GLP-1 and the mixture of the two particles have different biological effects. The biodistribution of the two constructs may be very different depending on the relative release rates of the two peptides when they are attached to the same particle. The "side car" phenomena could be important in determining the final biological outcome. In summary the ability to separate out the ability of GLP-1 to increase insulin Cmax and avoid a pancreatic insulinotropic effect could be of significant medical benefit -possibly reducing the risk of pancreatitis. Diabetic patients do not have a defect in the quantity of intestinal endogenous GLP-1 released after a meal or glucose challenge. But peripheral insulin resistance in diabetics is paralleled by GLP-1 tissue resistance - i.e. reduced bioactivity at the receptor organs and the metabolic mechanisms may be identical. The main therapeutic action then for GLP-1 treatment should therefore be aimed at enhancing the bioavailability of insulin either endogenously produced or exogenously administered. The ability of NP-insulin/GLP to solve both of these problems is very attractive for a therapeutic product. Example 9 As mentioned above, the compositions of the present invention may be delivered via nasal delivery. For example, an aqueous solution containing insulin/GLP-1 nanoparticles may be formulated and applied in the form of a spray to the nasal membranes using an atomizer, a nebulizer or a sprayer. The spray of the solution carrying the nanoparticles are contacted with the nasal mucus membrane and absorbed thereby.
