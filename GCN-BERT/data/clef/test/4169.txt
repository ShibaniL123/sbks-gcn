DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Before describing the disclosed embodiments of this technology in detail, it is to be understood that the technology is not limited in its application to the details of the particular arrangement shown here since the technology described is capable of other embodiments. Also, the terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation. Writing on plastic and like surfaced food containers is usually done with a Sharpie® type marker which is permanent. This defeats the reusability of containers for other items. Other markers, such as for example, grease pencils, crayons, and paint pens do not work well either. Additionally all of these marking instruments are no food-safe and non-toxic. In each case these marking instruments either ruin the container and/or do not work well. Utilizing stickers or labels on containers and then writing on the stickers is one option, but such use results in sticky label residue and time consuming cleaning efforts for reuse of the container. There are many deficiencies and shortcomings with these marking instruments. In various exemplary embodiments, the technology described herein provides a refillable marking device with a washable marking composition for food containers, and the like, that is food-safe and non-toxic. The marking device is suitable for labeling, for example, food leftovers in a container. The device is suitable on plastic surfaces and also on surfaces such as reservation boards and the like. The marking device is in a form of a stick for use like a refill in a pen-like device. The composition used within the marking device is food-safe and non-toxic. Once used the marking composition is easily removed from a surface. With soap and water the markings can easily be removed. Additionally, the marking composition does not smear and is not compromised by heat and condensation. Testing of the marking composition has found that heat and condensation do not adversely affect the applied markings. This is very beneficial for containers having food items where any loss of the labeling information would likely result in the loss of food at an expense to the owner. In use, the marking device allows for repeatedly writing on food containers for labelling and identification purposes, and provides for ease of use to reuse the containers. There is a significant savings in both time and money when using this marking device instead of using traditional sticky labels and markers. This marking instrument eliminates the need for expensive labels. Such labels are designed for single use and are hard to remove. This technology provides an easy to use, inexpensive alternative to such labels. In addition to food containers, the marking device also is suitable for clothing containers, restaurant equipment, stainless steel, glass, plastic, laminate, metal, holding bins and pans, reservation boards, and so forth. Testing has shown that the marking device applies very well to Pyrex®, Rubbermaid®, Tupperware®, and other brand name container and pan devices ubiquitous in the marketplace. The marking instrument can write on dry, non-porous surfaces. Due to the nature of the marking composition used, the marking device does not dry out. Known marking device systems dry out over time. Thus, this marking device provides a device that is much longer lasting. The marking instrument is beneficial in commercial and institutional settings. By way of example, this marking device will be useful to restaurants, schools, kitchen facilities, and so forth. Use of such a marking device allows these institutions to avoid use of labels which provides great cost savings. The marking device requires less training of the prep staff, requires less work, and provides for quick labeling of items. The marking device reduces errors, therefore decreasing risk and liability. The marking device endures compliance with FDA Food Code and HACCP food management systems. This product conforms to U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, and is therefore exempt from the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard as an Article. Additionally, the marking device reduces food waste due to improper sticky labeling. Referring now to the figures, a writing instrument 10 marking device having a refillable, washable marking composition for labeling food containers, and the like, such as for example, container 44 in FIG. 4, that is food-safe and non-toxic, is shown. The marking device includes a housing 16. The housing 16 is essentially shell within which or coupled to all other elements work. The housing 16 is elongated and generally cylindrical in form and having a hollow interior channel. In at least one embodiment, the writing instrument 10 includes a clip 18. Clip 18 provides a means by which the writing instrument 10 can be attached to an item, such as for example, a pocket in a shirt. The clip 18 is plastic in at least one embodiment. The clip 18 is metal in at least one embodiment. The clip 18 includes cuff 14 by which the clip is attached to the housing 16 of the writing instrument 10. The marking device includes a marking composition 24. The marking composition 24 is disposed within the hollow interior channel of the housing 16. The marking composition 24 is food-safe and non-toxic. The marking composition 24 provides a means by which a container 44 can be marked with a mark 46, as depicted in FIG. 4, to identify an item contained within the container 44. The marking device includes a marker tip 22. The marker tip 22 is removably coupled to the housing 16 to receive the marking composition 24 within the housing 16 as it is extended outwardly for use. In at least one embodiment, the point at which the marker tip 22 and the housing 16 are coupled is contoured with taper 20. The marker tip 22 includes an aperture 26. The aperture 26 is disposed within a distal end of the marker tip 22 to guide the marking composition 24 as it advances within the hollow interior channel of the housing 16 to extend into the marker tip 22 and extends outwardly for use. As depicted in FIG. 1, the marking composition 24 is extended out from the aperture 26. As depicted in FIG. 3, the marking composition 24 is not extended out from the aperture 26 and is in a retracted or non-extended form. The marker tip 22 includes threads 30. The threads 30 are configured to be received by the hollow interior channel of the housing 16. As such, the marker tip 22 is removable by the user in order to replace the marking composition 24 when the prior one is used. The threads 30 are disposed on the marker tip 22 at surface 28, which is slightly less in diameter than the remaining portion of the marker tip 22 to allow room for the threads 30 within the housing 16. The marking device 10 includes a twist cap 12. The twist cap 12 is coupled to the housing 16. As twisted the twist cap 12 advances the marking composition 24 disposed within the hollow interior channel of the housing 16 to extend into the marker tip 22 and extended outwardly for use. The twist cap 12 can be a portion of a large cylindrical sleeve have a first portion 40 and a second portion 42. The sleeve is sized such that it fits within the hollow interior channel of the housing 16. The sleeve also covers the driving column 34. The marking device 10 includes a driving column 34. The driving column 34 is disposed within the hollow interior channel of the housing 16. The driving column 34 includes threads 36 in at least one embodiment. The driving column 34 is configured to advance the marking composition 24 disposed within the hollow interior channel of the housing 16 to extend into the marker tip and extended outwardly for use. Placement spacers such as 38 and 32 are utilized within the housing 16 to further couple and secure the driving column 34, marker tip 22 within the housing 16. The marking device 10 can vary in size and shape. However, in at least one embodiment, the marking device 10 is approximately five and a quarter inches in length and approximately three eights of an inch in width. The marker tip 22 of the device 10 is approximately one fourth of an inch in width. The lengths, widths, diameters of the marking device 10 can vary based on use and application. In at least one embodiment, the marking composition 24 includes a natural wax, a fatty acid, and a toner. Additionally, in varied embodiments, the marking composition 24 also includes ceresin. Furthermore, in varied embodiments, the marking composition 24, also includes talc powder. Still furthermore, in varied embodiments, the marking composition includes beef tallow. These novel combinations and compositions provides a marking means that is easily washable and well suited for marking food storage containers and the like. The marking composition 24 can include varied coloring agents to vary the color of the markings. A natural wax is an organic compound. It is plastic (malleable) near ambient temperatures. Because of its properties, a natural wax is useful as a base for the marking composition. In at least one embodiment, the natural wax is a beeswax. Beeswax is a natural wax produced in the bee hive of honey bees of the genus Apis. It is mainly esters of fatty acids and various long-chain alcohols. Small amounts of beeswax have food and flavoring applications, and are edible in the sense of having similar toxicity to undigestable plant waxes. However, the wax monoesters in beeswax are poorly hydrolysed in the guts of humans and mammals, so are of no significant food value. With the base of beeswax, other composition elements are added that are suitable for a marking composition 24 in the marking device 10. In at least one embodiment, the marking composition includes 8-12% beeswax. In at least one embodiment, the marking composition 24 comprises 10% beeswax. Ceresin is a wax derived from ozokerite by a purifying process. The purifying process of the ozokerite commonly comprises a treatment with heat and sulfuric acid, but other processes are also in use. Ceresin can be used as an alternative to, or in combination with beeswax. In at least one embodiment, the marking composition 24 includes between 8-12% ceresin. In at least one embodiment, the marking composition 24 comprises 10% ceresin. Beef tallow is a rendered form of beef, processed from suet. It is solid at room temperature. Unlike suet, tallow can be stored for extended periods without the need for refrigeration to prevent decomposition, provided it is kept in an airtight container to prevent oxidation. In industry, tallow is not strictly defined as beef or mutton fat. In this context, tallow is animal fat that conforms to certain technical criteria, including its melting point. It is common for commercial tallow to contain fat derived from other animals, such as lard from pigs, or even from plant sources. In at least one embodiment, the marking composition 24 includes between 8-12% beef tallow. In at least one embodiment, the marking composition 24 comprises 10% beef tallow. Talc is a mineral composed of hydrated magnesium silicate with the chemical formula H2Mg3(SiO3)4 or Mg3Si4O10(OH)2. In loose form, it is the widely used substance known as talcum powder. It occurs as foliated to fibrous masses, and in an exceptionally rare crystal form. It is the softest known mineral and listed as I on the Mohs hardness scale. It can be easily scratched by a fingernail. In at least one embodiment, the marking composition 24 includes between 4-6% talc powder. In at least one embodiment, the marking composition 24 comprises 5% talc powder. A fatty acid is a carboxylic acid (organic compound) with a long aliphatic tail (chain), which is either saturated or unsaturated. Most naturally occurring fatty acids have a chain of an even number of carbon atoms, from 4 to 28. Fatty acids are usually derived from triglycerides or phospholipids. When they are not attached to other molecules, they are known as “free” fatty acids. Stearic acid and zinc stearate are fatty acids. In at least one embodiment, the marking composition 24 includes between 40-50% stearic acid. In at least one embodiment, the marking composition 24 comprises 45% stearic acid. The commercial stearic acid from which the stearate salts are manufactured is actually a mixture of monocarboxylic acids obtained from animal and/or vegetable sources. In general, applications of stearic acid exploit its bifunctional character, with a polar head group that can be attached to metal cations and a nonpolar chain that confers solubility in organic solvents. The combination leads to uses as a surfactant and softening agent. Stearic acid undergoes the typical reactions of saturated carboxylic acids. The salts and esters of stearic acid are called stearates. Stearic acid is one of the most common saturated fatty acids found in nature. One such stearate is zinc stearate. The Stearate salts, including Lithium Stearate, Aluminum Distearate, Aluminum Stearate, Aluminum Tristearate, Ammonium Stearate, Calcium Stearate, Magnesium Stearate, Potassium Stearate, Sodium Stearate, and Zinc Stearate are fine, white powders with a slight fatty odor. In cosmetics and personal care products, Stearate salts are used mainly in the formulation of makeup products such as eyeliner, eye shadow, mascara, lipsticks, blushers, face powders and foundations. They are also used in fragrances, deodorants, and hair and skin care products. The Stearate salts are generally used for their lubricating properties. They also help to keep emulsions from separating into their oil and liquid components. The Stearate salts increase the thickness of the lipid (oil) portion of cosmetics and personal care products and reduce the clear or transparent appearance of finished products. With this combined marking composition 24 of beeswax, serving as a base, stearic acid, as a softening agent, and zinc stearate, as a lubricant, a useful means for marking containers for food and the like is made. Additionally, a toner is utilized within the marking composition 24. The toner can be used to provide color to the marking composition 24. It at least one embodiment, the toner is titanium. Alternative toners are anticipated in various embodiments. In at least one embodiment, titanium dioxide is used between 15 to 25% of the marking composition 24. In at least one embodiment, titanium dioxide comprises 20% of the marking composition 24. Therefore, it at least one preferred embodiment, the marking composition comprises: 40-50% stearic acid, 15-25% titanium dioxide, 8-12% beeswax, 8-12% beef tallow, 8-12% ceresin, and 4-6% talc powder. In yet another preferred embodiment, the marking composition comprises: 45% stearic acid, 20% titanium dioxide, 10% beeswax, 10% beef tallow, 10% ceresin, and 5% talc powder. The marking device 10 can be utilized with the following method steps: providing a marking device having a refillable, washable marking composition 24; advancing the marking composition with the hollow interior channel of the housing 16, extending into the marker tip 22, and extending outwardly for use; applying the marker tip 22 to a surface 44 to be marked with sufficient pressure to apply the marking composition to the surface and to leave a marking 46; and moving the marker tip 22 along the surface 44 to write on the surface, leaving a mark 46 of the marking composition 24. Additionally, the method can include refilling the marking composition 24 when a new one is needed.
