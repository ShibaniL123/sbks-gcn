FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method of repairing and preventing hair damage. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Shampoo and conditioner compositions comprising various combinations of detersive surfactants, conditioning agents, and carriers are known. These products typically include a shampoo which comprises an anionic detersive surfactant in combination with a cationic deposition polymer and a conditioning agent such as a silicone, a hydrocarbon oil, a fatty ester, or combinations thereof, and a conditioner composition comprising a cationic surfactant and silicone materials. These products have become more popular among consumers as a means of conveniently obtaining hair conditioning and cleansing performance. Historically, it has been difficult to provide a rinse off hair care shampoo and conditioner regimen which delivers hair damage repair and prevention while still delivering the consumer desired hair cleaning benefits. In rinse off compositions a number of attempts have been made to address aspects of damage repair and prevention with minimal success. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved hair care regimen that repairs existing hair damage, prevents future hair damage while continuing to deliver consumer desired cleaning benefits.

Cationic Guar Deposition Polymer According to an embodiment of the present invention, the shampoo composition comprises a cationic guar polymer, which is a cationically substituted galactomannan (guar) gum derivatives. Guar gum for use in preparing these guar gum derivatives is typically obtained as a naturally occurring material from the seeds of the guar plant. The guar molecule itself is a straight chain mannan, which is branched at regular intervals with single membered galactose units on alternative mannose units. The mannose units are linked to each other by means of β(1-4) glycosidic linkages. The galactose branching arises by way of an α(1-6) linkage. Cationic derivatives of the guar gums are obtained by reaction between the hydroxyl groups of the polygalactomannan and reactive quaternary ammonium compounds. The degree of substitution of the cationic groups onto the guar structure must be sufficient to provide the requisite cationic charge density described below. According to one embodiment, the cationic guar polymer has a weight average M.Wt. of less than about 2.2 million g/mol and greater than about 500,000 g/mol, and has a charge density of from about 0.05 meq/g to about 2.5 meq/g.

Accordingly, insoluble polysiloxanes referred to herein for the purpose of the invention include polysiloxanes such as alpha, omega hydroxy-terminated polysiloxanes or alpha, omega alkoxy-terminated polysiloxanes having a molecular weight within the range from about 50,000 to about 500,000 g/mol. As used herein, “insoluble polysiloxane” means that the water solubility of the polysiloxane is less than 0.05 wt %. The water solubility of the polysiloxane can be less than 0.02 wt %, or less than 0.01 wt %, or less than 0.001 wt %. The insoluble polysiloxane can be present in the personal care composition in an amount within the range from about 0.1 wt % to less than about 2 wt %, based on the total weight of the composition. For example, the insoluble polysiloxane can be present in an amount within the range from about 0.1 wt % to about 1.75 wt %, or from about 0.2% to about 1.75%, or from about 0.4 wt % to about 1.5 wt %, or from about 0.5 wt % to about 1.5 wt %, based on the total weight of the composition. According to one aspect of the silicone emulsion, the insoluble polysiloxane used herein include alpha, omega hydroxy- or alkoxy-terminated polysiloxanes having a general formula I: [in-line-formulae]R1[O—SiR2]n-OR1,[/in-line-formulae] wherein ‘n’ is an integer, R is a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C10 alkyl or aryl, and R1 is a hydrogen or a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C10 alkyl or aryl. Non-limiting examples of R and R1 may be independently selected from alkyl groups such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, tertpentyl, hexyl such as n-hexyl, heptyl such as n-heptyl, octyl such as n-octyl and isooctyl such as 2,2,4-trimethyl-pentyl, nonyl such as n-nonyl, decyl such as n-decyl, dodecyl such as n-dodecyl, octadecyl such as n-octadecyl; or aryl groups such as phenyl, naphthyl, anthryl and phenanthryl. Suitable insoluble polysiloxanes can have a general formula H—[O—SiR2]n-OH. According to another aspect of the silicone emulsion, the insoluble polysiloxane has a molecular weight within the range from about 50,000 to about 500,000 g/mol. For example, the insoluble polysiloxane may have a molecular weight within the range from about 60,000 to about 400,000; from about 75,000 to about 300,000; from about 100,000 to about 200,000; or the molecular weight may be about 150,000 g/mol. According to another aspect of the silicon emulsion, total content of a cyclic polysiloxane having a general formula: wherein R is as defined above, and wherein m is 4 or 5, is present in the silicone emulsion in an amount less than about 2.5 wt % based on the total weight of all polysiloxanes. For example, dimethiconol may include significant quantities of cyclic polysiloxanes, such as octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) and decamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D5). In an embodiment, the amount of D4 is less than about 2.0%, or less than about 1.5%, or less than about 1.0%, or less than about 0.5%, based on the total weight of all polysiloxanes. In an embodiment, the amount of D5 is less than about 0.5%, or less than about 0.4%, or less than about 0.3%, or less than about 0.2%, based on the total weight of all polysiloxanes. According to yet another aspect of the silicone emulsion, the emulsion has a viscosity up to about 500,000 cPs. For example, the viscosity may be within the range from about 75,000 to about 300,000, from about 100,000 to about 200,000, or about 150,000 cPs. According to yet another aspect of the silicone emulsion, the insoluble polysiloxane has an average particle size within the range from about 30 nm to about 10 micron. The average particle size may be within the range from about 40 nm to about 5 micron, from about 50 nm to about 1 micron, from about 75 nm to about 500 nm, or about 100 nm, for example. The molecular weight of the insoluble polysiloxane, the viscosity of the silicone emulsion, and the size of the particle comprising the insoluble polysiloxane are determined by methods commonly used by those skilled in the art, such as the methods disclosed in Smith, A. L. The Analytical Chemistry of Silicones, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.: New York, 1991. For example, the viscosity of the silicone emulsion can be measured at 30° C. with a Brookfield viscosimeter with spindle 6 at 2.5 rpm. According to another aspect of the silicone emulsion, the emulsion further includes an anionic surfactant that participates in providing high internal phase viscosity emulsions having particle sizes in the range from about 30 nm to about 10 micron. The anionic surfactant is selected from organic sulfonic acids. Most common sulfonic acids used in the present process are alkylaryl sulfonic acid; alkylaryl polyoxyethylene sulphonic acid; alkyl sulfonic acid; and alkyl polyoxyethylene sulfonic acid. General formulas of the sulfonic acids are as shown below: [in-line-formulae]R2C6H4SO3H (II)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]R2C6H4O(C2H4O)mSO3H (III)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]R2SO3H (IV)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]R2O(C2H4O)mSO3H (IV)[/in-line-formulae] Where R2, which may differ, is a monovalent hydrocarbon radical having at least 6 carbon atoms. Non-limiting examples of R2 include hexyl, octyl, decyl, dodecyl, cetyl, stearyl, myristyl, and oleyl. ‘m’ is an integer from 1 to 25.

Generally, 1 to 15% anionic surfactant is used in the emulsion process. For example, 3-10% anionic surfactant can be used to obtain an optimum result. The silicone emulsion may further include an additional emulsifier together with the anionic surfactant, which along with the controlled temperature of emulsification and polymerization, facilitates making the emulsion in a simple and faster way. Non-ionic emulsifiers having a hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) value of 10 to 19 are suitable and include polyoxyalkylene alkyl ether, polyoxyalkylene alkylphenyl ethers and polyoxyalkylene sorbitan esters.

High Melting Point Fatty Compound The conditioner gel matrix of the conditioner composition includes one or more high melting point fatty compounds. The high melting point fatty compounds useful herein may have a melting point of 25° C. or higher, and is selected from the group consisting of fatty alcohols, fatty acids, fatty alcohol derivatives, fatty acid derivatives, and mixtures thereof. It is understood by the artisan that the compounds disclosed in this section of the specification can in some instances fall into more than one classification, e.g., some fatty alcohol derivatives can also be classified as fatty acid derivatives. However, a given classification is not intended to be a limitation on that particular compound, but is done so for convenience of classification and nomenclature. Further, it is understood by the artisan that, depending on the number and position of double bonds, and length and position of the branches, certain compounds having certain carbon atoms may have a melting point of less than 25° C. Such compounds of low melting point are not intended to be included in this section. Nonlimiting examples of the high melting point compounds are found in International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary, Fifth Edition, 1993, and CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Handbook, Second Edition, 1992. Among a variety of high melting point fatty compounds, fatty alcohols are suitable for use in the conditioner composition. The fatty alcohols useful herein are those having from about 14 to about 30 carbon atoms, from about 16 to about 22 carbon atoms. These fatty alcohols are saturated and can be straight or branched chain alcohols. Suitable fatty alcohols include, for example, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, behenyl alcohol, and mixtures thereof. High melting point fatty compounds of a single compound of high purity can be used. Single compounds of pure fatty alcohols selected from the group of pure cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, and behenyl alcohol can also be used. By “pure” herein, what is meant is that the compound has a purity of at least about 90%, and/or at least about 95%. These single compounds of high purity provide good rinsability from the hair when the consumer rinses off the composition. The high melting point fatty compound can be included in the conditioner composition at a level of from about 0.1% to about 20%, alternatively from about 1% to about 15%, and alternatively from about 1.5% to about 8% by weight of the composition, in view of providing improved conditioning benefits such as slippery feel during the application to wet hair, softness and moisturized feel on dry hair. C. Aqueous Carrier The conditioner gel matrix of the conditioner composition includes a second aqueous carrier. Accordingly, the formulations of the conditioner composition can be in the form of pourable liquids (under ambient conditions). Such compositions will therefore typically comprise a second aqueous carrier, which is present at a level of from about 20 wt % to about 95 wt %, or from about 60 wt % to about 85 wt %. The second aqueous carrier may comprise water, or a miscible mixture of water and organic solvent, and in one aspect may comprise water with minimal or no significant concentrations of organic solvent, except as otherwise incidentally incorporated into the composition as minor ingredients of other components. The second aqueous carriers useful in the conditioner composition include water and water solutions of lower alkyl alcohols and polyhydric alcohols.

The polyhydric alcohols useful herein include propylene glycol, hexylene glycol, glycerin, and propane diol. D. Additional Conditioning Agents According to embodiments of the present invention, the hair care composition includes a silicone conditioning agent which comprises a silicone compound. The silicone compound may comprise volatile silicone, non-volatile silicones, or combinations thereof. In one aspect, non-volatile silicones are employed. If volatile silicones are present, it will typically be incidental to their use as a solvent or carrier for commercially available forms of non-volatile silicone materials ingredients, such as silicone gums and resins. The silicone compounds may comprise a silicone fluid conditioning agent and may also comprise other ingredients, such as a silicone resin to improve silicone fluid deposition efficiency or enhance glossiness of the hair. The concentration of the silicone compound in the conditioner composition typically ranges from about 0.01 wt % to about 10 wt %, from about 0.1 wt % to about 8 wt %, from about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt %, or even from about 0.2 wt % to about 3 wt %, for example Exemplary silicone compounds include (a) a first polysiloxane which is non-volatile, substantially free of amino groups, and has a viscosity of from about 100,000 mm2s−1 to about 30,000,000 mm2s−1; (b) a second polysiloxane which is non-volatile, substantially free of amino groups, and has a viscosity of from about 5 mm2s−1 to about 10,000 mm2s−1; (c) an aminosilicone having less than about 0.5 wt % nitrogen by weight of the aminosilicone; (d) a silicone copolymer emulsion with an internal phase viscosity of greater than about 100×106 mm2S−1, as measured at 25° C.; (e) a silicone polymer containing quaternary groups; or (f) a grafted silicone polyol, wherein the silicone compounds (a)-(f) are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2008/0292574, 2007/0041929, 2008/0292575, and 2007/0286837, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. The hair care composition of the present invention may comprise an amino silicone having less than about 0.5 wt % nitrogen by weight of the aminosilicone, such as less than about 0.2 wt %, or less than about 0.1 wt %, in view of friction reduction benefit. It has been surprisingly found that higher levels of nitrogen (amine functional groups) in the amino silicone tend to result in less friction reduction, and consequently less conditioning benefit from the aminosilicone. The aminosilicone useful herein may have at least one silicone block with greater than 200 siloxane units, in view of friction reduction benefit. The aminosilicones useful herein include, for example, quaternized aminosilicone and non-quaternized aminosilicone. In one embodiment, the aminosilicones useful herein are water-insoluble. In the present invention, “water-insoluble aminosilicone” means that the aminosilicone has a solubility of 10 g or less per 100 g water at 25° C., in another embodiment 5 g or less per 100 g water at 25° C., and in another embodiment 1 g or less per 100 g water at 25° C. In the present invention, “water-insoluble aminosilicone” means that the aminosilicone is substantially free of copolyol groups. If copolyol groups are present, they are present at a level of less than 10 wt %, less than 1 wt %, or less than 0.1 wt % by weight of the aminosilicone. According to one embodiment, aminosilicone useful herein are those which conform to the general formula (III): [in-line-formulae](R2)aG3-a-Si(—O—SiG2)n(—O—SiGb(R2)2-b)m—O—SiG3-a(R2)a (IIII)[/in-line-formulae] wherein G is hydrogen, phenyl, hydroxy, or C1-C8 alkyl, such as methyl; a is an integer having a value from 1 to 3, such as 1; b is an integer having a value from 0 to 2, such as 1; n is a number from 1 to 2,000, such as from 100 to 1,800, from 300 to 800, or from 500 to 600; m is an integer having a value from 0 to 1,999, such as from 0 to 10, or 0; R2 is a monovalent radical conforming to the general formula CqH2qL, wherein q is an integer having a value from 2 to 8 and L is selected from the following groups: —N(R32)CH2—CH2—N(R32)2; —N(R3)2; —N+(R3)3A−; —N(R3)CH2—CH2—N+R3H2A−; wherein R3 is hydrogen, phenyl, benzyl, or a saturated hydrocarbon radical, such as an alkyl radical from about C1 to about C20; A− is a halide ion. According to an embodiment, L is —N(CH3)2 or —NH2. According to another embodiment, L is —NH2. The aminosilicone of the above formula is used at levels by weight of the composition of from about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt %, alternatively from about 0.2 wt % to about 2 wt %, alternatively from about 0.2 wt % to about 1.0 wt %, and alternatively from about 0.3 wt % to about 0.8 wt %. According to one embodiment, the aminosilicone may include those compounds corresponding to formula (III) wherein m=0; a=1; q=3; G=methyl; n is from about 1400 to about 1700, such as about 1600; and L is —N(CH3)2 or —NH2, such as —NH2. According to another embodiment, the aminosilicone may include those compounds corresponding to formula (III) wherein m=0; a=1; q=3; G=methyl; n is from about 400 to about 800, such as from about 500 to around 600; and L is L is —N(CH3)2 or —NH2, such as —NH2. Accordingly, the aforementioned aminosilicones can be called terminal aminosilicones, as one or both ends of the silicone chain are terminated by nitrogen containing group. Such terminal aminosilicones may provide improved friction reduction compared to graft aminosilicones. Another example of an aminosilicone useful herein includes, for example, quaternized aminosilicone having a tradename KF8020 available from Shinetsu. The above aminosilicones, when incorporated into the hair care composition, can be mixed with solvent having a lower viscosity. Such solvents include, for example, polar or non-polar, volatile or non-volatile oils. Such oils include, for example, silicone oils, hydrocarbons, and esters. Among such a variety of solvents, exemplary solvents include those selected from the group consisting of non-polar, volatile hydrocarbons, volatile cyclic silicones, non-volatile linear silicones, and mixtures thereof. The non-volatile linear silicones useful herein are those having a viscosity of from about 1 mm2s−1 to about 20,000 mm2s−1, such as from about 20 mm2s−1 to about 10,000 mm2s−1, at 25° C. According to one embodiment, the solvents are non-polar, volatile hydrocarbons, especially non-polar, volatile isoparaffins, in view of reducing the viscosity of the aminosilicones and providing improved hair conditioning benefits such as reduced friction on dry hair. Such mixtures may have a viscosity of from about 1,000 mPa·s to about 100,000 mPa·s, and alternatively from about 5,000 mPa·s to about 50,000 mPa·s.

In Home Product Use Test Method Naïve female panelists in the U.S., ranging in age from 18-65 participated in this usage study. The study was executed and data was collected by an independent marketing research supplier. Research panelists were voluntary participants from the supplier's on-line database and represented a spectrum of ethnicities, hair types and lengths, income levels, household sizes and geographic regions within the U.S. on-line population. The recruitment criteria included a minimum shampoo frequency of 3 times a week (or more) and usage of a rinse-off conditioner in at least half of the shampoo occasions. In addition to the above recruitment criteria, the supplier also ensured that upon placement every test leg was balanced across a spectrum of hair lengths. Panelists were given a test shampoo & rinse-off conditioner to use in place of their typical products for four weeks. Throughout the study period, the women followed their typical usage routine. Shampoo and conditioner dosage and frequency of use were determined by the panelists. The test products were placed in plain white packaging and simply labeled as “Shampoo” and “Rinse-off Conditioner” test products. Neither brand nor benefit context were provided. Throughout the study period, panelists were permitted to use their normal styling products and follow their typical drying and styling routine. At the end of the study period, a self-administered, on-line survey was completed by each panelist. Study participants were asked to rate the test “Shampoo” and “Rinse-off Conditioner” combination on a standard 5 point “Poor to Excellent” scale, overall and for a series of Hair Care related benefits. The total base size of completed evaluations for each test “Shampoo” and “Rinse-off Conditioner” combination was a minimum of 200 women. In addition to the full panel, data was also analyzed among certain sub-populations seeking specific benefits. These sub-populations consisted of a minimum of 45 women. For this analysis, panelists seeking damage prevention benefits from their shampoo and rinse-off conditioner were studied. This population was selected because reducing hair breakage and preventing split ends are important indications of strong, damage resistant hair. All data was then analyzed using standard statistical tests at 90% Confidence and 80%. Shampoo Composition Described herein is a hair care composition, such as a shampoo composition comprising: a a) surfactant; b) a cationic deposition polymer; and c) a silicone emulsion; d) carrier, as well as an e) an optional benefit agent. The shampoo and conditioner combination (system) delivers substantially better split end prevention and reduction in hair breakage as determined by a blinded consumer usage test among panelists who are seeking damage prevention benefits (Table 1). These unique shampoo and conditioner systems (Shampoo Examples 1 and 7 and Conditioner Example 1) demonstrate better breakage reduction and split end prevention than the same shampoo paired with a different conditioner (Shampoo Example 1 and Comparative Conditioner Example A) and the same conditioner paired with a different shampoos (Comparative Shampoo Examples A, B, and C and Conditioner Example 1). Panelists' assessment of these benefits was completed following four weeks of using the designated shampoo and conditioner pairing under normal usage conditions. See Table 1.
