REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a Continuation-In-Part of application Ser. No. 13/918,506 filed Jun. 14, 2013, entitled “Polyethylene Composition, Film and Polymerization Process”, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The preparation of polyethylene copolymers, the films made from them as well as a polyethylene polymerization process are disclosed herein. In an embodiment, a phosphinimine type catalyst is employed to make ethylene copolymers having a relatively high melt flow ratio (I21/I2) and a multimodal TREF profile. The ethylene copolymers have a composition distribution breadth index CDBI50 of between about 45 wt % and about 75 wt % and can be made into film with good physical properties while exhibiting enhanced processability. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The search for polyethylene products having an improved balance of physical properties and processability has led to the development of products having improved output capacity and ever improving end use properties such as enhanced film tear or dart impact properties. Particularly useful is the development of polymer architectures for which polymer blending strategies can be avoided for enhancement of polymer properties, since these strategies increase cost. U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2011/0003099 discusses low melt flow ratio (MFR) linear polyethylene and high melt flow ratio (MFR) linear polyethylene, which are distinguished by an I21/I2 of less than 30 and an I21/I2 of greater than 30 respectively. Resins having both a narrow molecular weight distribution and a low melt flow ratio are well known and include resins produced with metallocene catalysts and phosphinimine catalysts. Such resins include for example Exceed 1018A™ from ExxonMobil and those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,420,220 and Canadian Pat. Appl. No. 2,734,167. These resins can be made into films having a good balance of physical and optical properties, but can be difficult to process in the absence of processing aids, as indicated by, for example, a relatively low output capacity on a blown film line. Resins having a higher melt flow ratio are more attractive to film producers because they are generally easier to process. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,255,426 and 6,476,171 and U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2011/0003099 each describe the production and use of resins having melt flow ratios which are in excess of 30 and which have moderately broad molecular weight distributions. The resins are thought to contain long chain branching. The polymers disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,255,426 and 6,476,171 are made with a bridged bis-indenyl zirconocene catalyst and have a composition distribution breadth index (CDBI) of greater than 75%. The resins have been referred to as Enable™ polymers (ExxonMobil) in the patent literature (see for example, the Example Polymers disclosed in U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2011/0003099), and although the resins are relatively easy to process, they also have a good balance of strength and stiffness properties when blown into film. For example, the films had physical properties which were comparable to Exceed 1018A materials despite their better shear thinning behavior. The polymers disclosed in U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2011/0003099, include a new “Enable” grade resin having a low melt index (I2=0.3), a relatively high melt flow ratio (I21/I2 is from 46-58) and a moderately broad molecular weight distribution (e.g. Mw/Mn is 3.4). The polymers also have a single peak in a TREF profile, with a T(75)−T(25) of less than 4° C. Manipulation of the comonomer distribution profile has also provided novel ethylene copolymer architectures in an effort to improve the balance between physical properties and polymer processability. It is generally the case that metallocene catalysts and other so called “single site catalysts” typically incorporate comonomer more evenly than traditional Ziegler-Natta catalysts when used for catalytic ethylene copolymerization with alpha olefins. This fact is often demonstrated by measuring the composition distribution breadth index (CDBI) for corresponding ethylene copolymers. The definition of composition distribution breadth index (CDBI50) can be found in PCT publication WO 93/03093 and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,206,075. The CDBI50 is conveniently determined using techniques which isolate polymer fractions based on their solubility (and hence their comonomer content). For example, temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF) as described by Wild et al. J. Poly. Sci., Poly. Phys. Ed. Vol. 20, p 441, 1982 can be employed. From the weight fraction versus composition distribution curve, the CDBI50 is determined by establishing the weight percentage of a copolymer sample that has a comonomer content within 50% of the median comonomer content on each side of the median. Generally, Ziegler-Natta catalysts produce ethylene copolymers with a CDBI50 lower than that of a single site catalyst at a similar density consistent with a heterogeneously branched copolymer. Typically, a plurality of prominent peaks is observed for such polymers in a TREF (temperature raising elution fractionation) analysis. Such peaks are consistent with the presence of heterogeneously branched material which generally includes a highly branched fraction, a medium branched fraction and a higher density fraction having little or no short chain branching. In contrast, metallocenes and other single site catalysts, will most often produce ethylene copolymers having a CDBI50 higher than that of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst at similar density and which often contain a single prominent peak in a TREF analysis, consistent with a homogeneously branched copolymer. Despite the forgoing, methods have been developed to access polyethylene copolymer compositions having a broadened comonomer distribution (i.e. more Ziegler-Natta like) while otherwise maintaining product characteristics typical of metallocene and single site catalyst resin, such as high dart impact strength for blown film. Such resins can be made, for example, by using a mixture of metallocene catalysts in a single reactor, using a plurality of polymerization reactors under different polymerization conditions, or by blending metallocene produced ethylene copolymers. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,382,630, 5,382,631 and WO 93/03093 describe polyethylene copolymer blend compositions having broad or narrow molecular weight distributions, and broad or narrow comonomer distributions. For example a blend may have a narrow molecular weight distribution, while simultaneously having a bimodal composition distribution. Alternatively a blend may have a broad molecular weight distribution while simultaneously having a unimodal composition distribution. The blends are made by melt blending two polyethylene resins with similar or different molecular weights and similar or different comonomer contents, where each resin is formed using a metallocene catalyst in a gas phase reactor. U.S. Pat. No. 7,018,710 discloses blends comprising a high molecular weight component having a high comonomer content and a low molecular weight component having a low comonomer content. The ethylene copolymer blend, which arises from the use of a metallocene catalyst in a cascade dual reactor process where each reactor is operated under different conditions (e.g. a cascade slurry phase-gas phase reactor), shows two distinct maxima in a TREF fractogram. The polymers were applied as a sealing layer in a heat sealable film. A mixed catalyst system containing a “poor comonomer incorporator” and a “good comonomer incorporator” is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,828,394 and 7,141,632. The poor comonomer incorporating catalyst may be a metallocene having at least one fused ring cyclopentadienyl ligand, such as an indenyl ligand, with appropriate substitution (e.g. alkyl substitution at the 1-position). The good comonomer incorporating catalyst was selected from an array of well-known metallocenes and which was generally less sterically encumbered toward the front end of the molecule than the poor comonomer incorporator. These mixed catalyst systems produced polyethylene copolymers having a bimodal TREF distribution in which two elution peaks are well separated from one another, consistent with the presence of higher and lower density components. The mixed catalysts also produced ethylene copolymer having a broadened molecular weight distribution relative to ethylene copolymer made with either one of the single metallocene component catalysts. A mixed catalyst system comprising three distinct metallocene catalysts is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,384,158. Ethylene copolymers having broadened molecular weight distributions were obtained when using these catalyst systems to polymerize ethylene with an alpha olefin such as 1-hexene. U.S. Pat Appl. No. 2011/0212315 describes a linear ethylene copolymer having a bimodal or multimodal comonomer distribution profile as measured using DSC, TREF or CRYSTAF techniques. The copolymers maintain a high dart impact resistance when blown into film and are relatively easy to process as indicated by a reduced shear thinning index, relative to ethylene copolymers having a unimodal comonomer distribution profile. The exemplified ethylene copolymer compositions, which have a melt flow ratio of less than 30, are made in a single gas phase reactor by employing a mixed catalyst system comprising a metallocene catalyst and a late transition metal catalyst. U.S. Pat. No. 7,534,847 demonstrates that use of a chromium based transition metal catalyst gives an ethylene copolymer having a bimodal comonomer distribution (as indicated by CRYSTAF) with a CDBI of less than 50 wt % (see Table 1 of U.S. Pat. No. 7,534,847). The patent teaches that the copolymers may have a molecular weight distribution of from 1 to 8, significant amounts of vinyl group unsaturation, long chain branching and specific amounts of methyl groups as measured by CRYSTAF fractionation. U.S. Pat. No. 6,932,592 describes very low density (i.e. <0.916 g/cc) ethylene copolymers produced with a bulky non-bridged bis-Cp metallocene catalyst. A preferred metallocene is bis(1-methyl-3-n-butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride. The examples show that in the gas phase, supported versions of this catalyst produce copolymer from ethylene and 1-hexene which has a CDBI of between 60 and 70% and a bimodal comonomer distribution as measured by temperature raising elution fractionation (TREF). U.S. Pat. No. 6,420,507 describes a low density ethylene copolymer having a narrow molecular weight distribution (i.e. 1.5 to 3.0) and a bimodal TREF profile. The polymerization is carried out in the gas phase using a so called “constrained geometry” catalyst having an indenyl ligand. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,248,845, 6,528,597, 7,381,783 and U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2008/0108768 disclose that a bulky ligand metallocene based on hafnium and a small amount of zirconium can be used to provide an ethylene/1-hexene copolymer which has a bimodal TREF profile. It is taught that the hafnium chloride precursor compounds used to synthesize the bulky metallocene catalysts are either contaminated with small amount of zirconium chloride or that zirconium chloride may be deliberately added. The amounts of zirconium chloride present range from 0.1 mol % to 5 mol %. Hence, the final hafnocene catalysts contain small amounts (i.e. 0.1 to 5 mol %) of their zirconocene analogues. Since zirconium based catalysts can have superior activity relative to their hafnium analogs it is possible that the products made have a significant contribution from the zirconocene species. If this is the case, then it is perhaps not surprising that a bimodal TREF profile results. The patent provides data for cast and blown film applications which shows that compared to Exceed type resins, the polymers are more easily extruded, with lower motor load, higher throughput and reduced head pressure. The resins give cast film with high tear values and blown film with high dart impact values. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,956,088, 6,936,675, 7,179,876 and 7,172,816 disclose that use of a “substantially single” bulky ligand hafnium catalyst provides an ethylene copolymer composition having a CDBI of below 55%, especially below 45% as determined by CRYSTAF. Recall, that hafnocene catalysts derived from hafnium chloride are expected to have zirconocene contaminants present in low amounts. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,936,675 and 7,179,876 further teach that the CDBI could be changed under different temperature conditions when using hafnocene catalysts. Polymerization at lower temperatures gave ethylene copolymer having a broader composition distribution breadth index (CDBI) relative to polymers obtained at higher temperatures. For example, use of the catalysts bis(n-propylcyclopentadienyl)hafnium dichloride or bis(n-propylcyclopentadienyl)hafnium difluoride in a gas phase reactor for the copolymerization of ethylene and 1-hexene at ≦80° C., gave copolymers having a CDBI of between 20 and 35%, compared to CDBI values of between 40 and 50% for copolymers obtained at 85° C. The polymers disclosed can, under certain draw down ratios, provide films having a machine direction tear value of greater than 500 g/mil, a dart impact resistance of greater than 500 g/mil, as well as good stiffness. The polymers also have good processability. U.S. Pat. No. 5,281,679 describes bis-cyclopentadienyl metallocene catalysts which have secondary or tertiary carbon substituents on a cylcopentadienyl ring. The catalysts provide polyethylene materials with broadened molecular weight during gas phase polymerization. Cyclic bridged bulky ligand metallocene catalysts are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,339,134 and 6,388,115 which give easier processing ethylene polymers. A hafnocene catalyst is used in U.S. Pat. No. 7,875,690 to give an ethylene copolymer in a gas phase fluidized bed reactor. The copolymer has a so called “broad orthogonal composition distribution” which imparts improved physical properties and low extractables. A broad orthogonal composition distribution is one in which the comonomer is incorporated predominantly in the high molecular weight chains. The copolymers had a density of at least 0.927 g/cc. Polyethylene copolymers having a similarly broad orthogonal composition distribution but a lower density are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,084,560 and U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2011/0040041A1. Again a hafnocene catalyst is employed in a gas phase reactor to give the ethylene copolymer. U.S. Pat. No. 5,525,689 also discloses the use of a hafnium based metallocene catalyst for use in olefin polymerization. The polymers had a ratio of I10/I2 of from 8 to 50, a density of from 0.85 to 0.92 g/cc, a Mw/Mn of up to 4.0, and were made in the gas phase. U.S. Pat. No. 8,114,946 discloses ethylene copolymers which have a molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) ranging from 3.36 to 4.29, a reversed comonomer incorporation and contain low levels of long chain branching. The melt flow ratios of the disclosed polymers are generally below about 30. A bridged cyclopentadienyl/fluorenyl metallocene catalyst having an unsaturated pendant group is used to make the ethylene copolymers. The patent application does not mention films or film properties. U.S. Pat. No. 6,469,103 discusses ethylene copolymer compositions comprising a first and a second ethylene copolymer component. The individual components are defined using ATREF-DV analytical methods which show a bimodal or multimodal structure with respect to comonomer placement. The compositions have an I10/I2 value of greater 6.6 and a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution (i.e. Mw/Mn is less than or equal to 3.3) consistent with the presence of long chain branching. The polymers are made using a dual solution reactor system with mixed catalysts. A process for making ethylene polymer compositions involving the use of at least two polymerization reactors is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,319,989. The ethylene copolymers have a molecular weight distribution of greater than 4.0 and show two peaks when subjected to a crystallization analysis fractionation (CRYSTAF). U.S. Pat. No. 6,462,161 describes the use of either a constrained geometry type catalyst or a bridged bis-Cp metallocene catalyst to produce, in a single reactor, a polyolefin composition having long chain branching and a molecular weight maximum occurring in the part of the composition having the highest comonomer content (i.e. a reversed comonomer distribution). The compositions made with a constrained geometry catalyst have multimodal TREF profiles, and relatively narrow molecular weight distributions (e.g. the exemplified resins have a Mw/Mn of from 2.19 to 3.4, see Table 1 in the examples section of U.S. Pat. No. 6,462,161). The compositions made with a bridged bis-Cp metallocene catalyst have complex TREF profiles and somewhat broader molecular weight distribution (e.g. the exemplified reins have a Mw/Mn of 3.43 or 6.0, see Table 1 in the Examples section of U.S. Pat. No. 6,462,161). Ethylene copolymers are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 7,968,659 which have a melt index of from 1.0 to 2.5, a Mw/Mn of from 3.5 to 4.5, a melt elastic modulus G′ (G″=500 Pa) of from 40 to 150 Pa and an activation energy of flow (Ea) in the range of 28 to 45 kJ/mol. Constrained geometry catalysts are used to make the polymer compositions in the gas phase. U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,518 describes the use of a constrained geometry catalyst to give an ethylene copolymer composition having a reversed comonomer distribution as determined by various cross fractionation chromatography (CFC) parameters and a molecular weight distribution of from 2 to 10. U.S. Pat. No. 5,874,513 describes that the use of a mixture of components which give rise to a supported metallocene catalyst can, in a gas phase reactor, give an ethylene copolymer with reduced comonomer distribution homogeneity. The patent defines a composition distribution parameter Cb which is representative of the distribution of comonomers within the polymer composition. The TREF analysis of the copolymer composition showed a bimodal distribution. U.S. Pat. No. 6,441,116 discloses a film comprising an ethylene copolymer with a composition distribution curve obtained by TREF having four distinct areas including one peak defining area which is attributed to a highly branched component. An ethylene/alpha olefin copolymer produced with a Ziegler-Natta catalyst and having greater than about 17 weight percent of a high density fraction, as determined by analytical TREF methods, and a molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of less than about 3.6 is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,487,938. The high density fraction has little short chain branching, while the balance of the copolymer composition is referred to as the fraction containing short chain branching. Hence, the data is consistent with a bimodal distribution of comonomer incorporation into the ethylene copolymer. U.S. Pat. No. 6,642,340 describes an ethylene copolymer having a specific relationship between a melt flow rate and melt tension. The polymers further comprise between 0.5 and 8 wt % of a component eluting at not lower than 100° C. in a TREF analysis. Use of phosphinimine catalysts for gas phase olefin polymerization is the subject matter of U.S. Pat. No. 5,965,677. The phosphinimine catalyst is an organometallic compound having a phosphinimine ligand, a cyclopentadienyl type ligand and two activatable ligands, and which is supported on a suitable particulate support such as silica. The exemplified catalysts had the formula CpTi(N═P(tBu)3)X2 where X was Cl, Me or CI and —O-(2,6-iPr—C6H3). In co-pending CA Pat. Appl. No. 2,734,167 we showed that suitably substituted phosphinimine catalysts gave narrow molecular weight distribution copolymers which when made into film showed a good balance of optical and physical properties. Polymers and films made in the gas phase using various single site catalysts, including so called “phosphinimine” catalysts, were disclosed at Advances in Polyolefins II, Napa, California—Oct. 24-27, 1999 (“Development of NOVA's Single Site Catalyst Technology for use in the Gas Phase Process”—I. Coulter; D. Jeremic; A. Kazakov; I. McKay). In a disclosure made at the 2002 Canadian Society for Chemistry Conference (“Cyclopentadienyl Phosphinimine Titanium Catalysts—Structure, Activity and Product Relationships in Heterogeneous Olefin Polymerization.” R. P. Spence; I. McKay; C. Carter; L. Koch; D. Jeremic; J. Muir; A. Kazakov. NOVA Research and Technology Center, CIC, 2002), it was shown that phosphinimine catalysts bearing variously substituted cyclopentadienyl and indenyl ligands were active toward the gas phase polymerization of ethylene when in supported form. U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2008/0045406, discloses a supported phosphinimine catalyst comprising a C6F5 substituted indenyl ligand. The catalyst was activated with an ionic activator having an active proton for use in the polymerization of ethylene with 1-hexene. U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2006/0122054 discloses the use of a dual catalyst formulation one component of which is a phosphinimine catalyst having an n-butyl substituted indenyl ligand. The patent is directed to the formation of bimodal resins suitable for application in pipe. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We now report that a polymerization catalyst system comprising a single phosphinimine catalyst can provide an ethylene copolymer having a multimodal comonomer distribution profile and medium molecular weight distribution when used in a single reactor. Embodiments of the invention mitigate the need for polymer blends, mixed catalysts, or mixed reactor technologies in the formation of polyethylene resin which is easy to process and has a good balance of physical properties.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Other than in the operating examples or where otherwise indicated, all numbers or expressions referring to quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, etc. used in the specification and claims are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term “about.” Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that can vary depending upon the desired properties, which the present invention desires to obtain. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical values, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. Also, it should be understood that any numerical range recited herein is intended to include all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range of “1 to 10” is intended to include all sub-ranges between and including the recited minimum value of 1 and the recited maximum value of 10; that is, having a minimum value equal to or greater than 1 and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10. Because the disclosed numerical ranges are continuous, they include every value between the minimum and maximum values. Unless expressly indicated otherwise, the various numerical ranges specified in this application are approximations. All compositional ranges expressed herein are limited in total to and do not exceed 100 percent (volume percent or weight percent) in practice. Where multiple components can be present in a composition, the sum of the maximum amounts of each component can exceed 100 percent, with the understanding that, and as those skilled in the art readily understand, that the amounts of the components actually used will conform to the maximum of 100 percent. Provided herein are ethylene copolymers having a relatively high melt flow ratio and a multimodal profile in a temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF) plot. The copolymers can be made into film having high dart impact values and good stiffness properties under decreased extruder pressures and at good output rates. Polymerization Catalyst System The polymerization catalyst system used in embodiments of the present invention will comprise a single transition metal catalyst, but may comprise further components such as but not limited to a support(s), catalyst activator(s), and catalyst modifier(s). The term “single transition metal catalyst” and similar terms means that during preparation of the polymerization catalyst system, only one type of active transition metal catalyst is included, and excludes polymerization catalyst systems which comprise two or more different active transition metal catalysts such as mixed catalysts and dual catalysts. In some embodiments, the transition metal catalyst is an organometallic catalyst based on a group 4 transition metal. By organometallic catalyst it is meant that the catalyst will have at least one ligand within the transition metal coordination sphere which is bonded to the metal via at least one carbon-metal bond. Such catalysts may collectively be called “organotransition metal catalysts” or “group 4 organotransition metal catalysts” when based on a group 4 metal. In some embodiments, the organotransition metal catalyst is a single site catalyst based on a group 4 metal (where the number refers to columns in the Periodic Table of the Elements using IUPAC nomenclature). This includes titanium, hafnium and zirconium. The organotransition metal catalysts can be group 4 metal complexes in their highest oxidation state. An example organotransition metal catalyst that is useful in an embodiment of the present invention is a group 4 organotransition metal catalyst further comprising a phosphinimine ligand. Any organometallic catalyst/compound/complex having a phosphinimine ligand and which can be used to make the copolymer compositions further defined and described below (in the section titled “The Ethylene Copolymer Composition”) are contemplated for use. In one embodiment, organotransition metal catalysts having at least one phosphinimine ligand and which are active in the polymerization of olefins to polymers are termed “phosphinimine catalysts.” Transition metal catalysts are usually activated by one or more cocatalytic or catalyst activator species in order to provide polymer. Hence, transition metal polymerization catalysts are sometimes called “pre-catalysts”. In an embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine catalyst is defined by the formula: L(PI)MX2 where M is a group 4 transition metal selected from Ti, Hf, Zr; PI is a phosphinimine ligand; L is a substituted or unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl type ligand; and X is an activatable ligand. In an embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine catalyst will have a phosphinimine ligand which is not bridged to, or does not make a bridge with another ligand within the metal coordination sphere of the phosphinimine catalyst, such as for example a cyclopentadienyl type ligand. In an embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine catalyst will have a cyclopentadienyl type ligand which is not bridged to, or does not make a bridge with another ligand within the metal coordination sphere of the phosphinimine catalyst, such as for example a phosphinimine ligand. The phosphinimine ligand is defined by the formula: R13P═N— wherein each R1 is independently selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom; a halogen atom; a C1-20 hydrocarbyl radical which is unsubstituted or further substituted by one or more halogen atom; a C1-20 alkyl radical; a C1-8 alkoxy radical; a C6-10 aryl or aryloxy radical; an amido radical; a silyl radical; and a germanyl radical; P is phosphorus and N is nitrogen (which bonds to the metal M). In an embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine ligand is chosen so that each R1 is a hydrocarbyl radical. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine ligand is tri-(tertiarybutyl)phosphinimine (i.e. where each R1 is a tertiary butyl group or t-Bu group for short). As used herein, the term “cyclopentadienyl-type” ligand is meant to include ligands which contain at least one five-carbon ring which is bonded to the metal via eta-5 (or in some cases eta-3) bonding. Thus, the term “cyclopentadienyl-type” includes, for example, unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl, singly or multiply substituted cyclopentadienyl, unsubstituted indenyl, singly or multiply substituted indenyl, unsubstituted fluorenyl and singly or multiply substituted fluorenyl. Hydrogenated versions of indenyl and fluorenyl ligands are also contemplated for use, so long as the five-carbon ring which bonds to the metal via eta-5 (or in some cases eta-3) bonding remains intact. Substituents for a cyclopentadienyl ligand, an indenyl ligand (or hydrogenated version thereof) and a fluorenyl ligand (or hydrogenated version thereof) may be selected from the group consisting of a C1-30 hydrocarbyl radical (which hydrocarbyl radical may be unsubstituted or further substituted by for example a halide and/or a hydrocarbyl group; for example a suitable substituted C1-30 hydrocarbyl radical is a pentafluorobenzyl group such as —CH2C6F5); a halogen atom; a C1-8 alkoxy radical; a C6-10 aryl or aryloxy radical (each of which may be further substituted by for example a halide and/or a hydrocarbyl group); an amido radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by up to two C1-8 alkyl radicals; a phosphido radical which is unsubstituted or substituted by up to two C1-8 alkyl radicals; a silyl radical of the formula —Si(R′)3 wherein each R′ is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, a C1-8 alkyl or alkoxy radical, C6-10 aryl or aryloxy radicals; and a germanyl radical of the formula —Ge(R′)3 wherein R′ is as defined directly above. The term “perfluorinated aryl group” means that each hydrogen atom attached to a carbon atom in an aryl group has been replaced with a fluorine atom as is well understood in the art (e.g. a perfluorinated phenyl group or substituent has the formula —C6F5). In an embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine catalyst will have a single or multiply substituted indenyl ligand and a phosphinimine ligand which is substituted by three tertiary butyl substituents. An indenyl ligand (or “Ind” for short) as defined herein will have framework carbon atoms with the numbering scheme provided below, so the location of a substituent can be readily identified. In an embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine catalyst will have a singly substituted indenyl ligand and a phosphinimine ligand which is substituted by three tertiary butyl substituents. In an embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine catalyst will have a singly or multiply substituted indenyl ligand where the substituent is selected from the group consisting of a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a substituted or an unsubstituted aryl group, and a substituted or unsubstituted benzyl (e.g. C6H5CH2—) group. Suitable substituents for the alkyl, aryl or benzyl group may be selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups, aryl groups, alkoxy groups, aryloxy groups, alkylaryl groups (e.g. a benzyl group), arylalkyl groups and halide groups. In an embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine catalyst will have a singly substituted indenyl ligand, R2—Indenyl, where the R2 substituent is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a substituted or an unsubstituted aryl group, or a substituted or unsubstituted benzyl group. Suitable substituents for an R2 alkyl, R2 aryl or R2 benzyl group may be selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups, aryl groups, alkoxy groups, aryloxy groups, alkylaryl groups (e.g. a benzyl group), arylalkyl groups and halide groups. In an embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine catalyst will have an indenyl ligand having at least a 1-position substituent (1-R2) where the substituent R2 is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a substituted or an unsubstituted aryl group, or a substituted or unsubstituted benzyl group. Suitable substituents for an R2 alkyl, R2 aryl or R2 benzyl group may be selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups, aryl groups, alkoxy groups, aryloxy groups, alkylaryl groups (e.g. a benzyl group), arylalkyl groups and halide groups. In an embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine catalyst will have a singly substituted indenyl ligand, 1-R2-Indenyl where the substituent R2 is in the 1-position of the indenyl ligand and is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group, or a substituted or an unsubstituted benzyl group. Suitable substituents for an R2 alkyl, R2 aryl or R2 benzyl group may be selected from the group consisting of alkyl groups, aryl groups, alkoxy groups, aryloxy groups, alkylaryl groups (e.g. a benzyl group), arylalkyl groups and halide groups. In an embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine catalyst will have a singly substituted indenyl ligand, 1-R2-Indenyl, where the substituent R2 is a (partially/fully) halide substituted alkyl group, a (partially/fully) halide substituted benzyl group, or a (partially/fully) halide substituted aryl group. In an embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine catalyst will have a singly substituted indenyl ligand, 1-R2-Indenyl, where the substituent R2 is a (partially/fully) halide substituted benzyl group. When present on an indenyl ligand, a benzyl group can be partially or fully substituted by halide atoms, for example, fluoride atoms. The aryl group of the benzyl group may be a perfluorinated aryl group, a 2,6 (i.e. ortho) fluoro substituted phenyl group, 2,4,6 (i.e. ortho/para) fluoro substituted phenyl group or a 2,3,5,6 (i.e. ortho/meta) fluoro substituted phenyl group respectively. The benzyl group is, in an embodiment of the invention, located at the 1 position of the indenyl ligand. In an embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine catalyst will have a singly substituted indenyl ligand, 1-R2-Indenyl, where the substituent R2 is a pentafluorobenzyl (C6F5CH2—) group. In an embodiment of the invention, the phosphinimine catalyst has the formula: (1-R2-(Ind))M(N═P(t-Bu)3)X2 where R2 is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group, a substituted or an unsubstituted aryl group, or a substituted or unsubstituted benzyl group, wherein substituents for the alkyl, aryl or benzyl group are selected from the group consisting of alkyl, aryl, alkoxy, aryloxy, alkylaryl, arylalkyl and halide substituents; M is Ti, Zr or Hf; and X is an activatable ligand.

Other organotransition metal catalysts which may also be contemplated for use include metallocene catalysts (which have two cyclopentadienyl type ligands), and constrained geometry catalysts (which have an amido type ligand and a cyclopentadienyl type ligand). Some non-limiting examples of metallocene catalysts, which may or may not be useful, can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,808,561; 4,701,432; 4,937,301; 5,324,800; 5,633,394; 4,935,397; 6,002,033 and 6,489,413, which are incorporated herein by reference. Some non-limiting examples of constrained geometry catalysts, which may or may not be useful, can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,057,475; 5,096,867; 5,064,802; 5,132,380; 5,703,187 and 6,034,021, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. The term “activatable”, means that the ligand X may be cleaved from the metal center M via a protonolysis reaction or abstracted from the metal center M by suitable acidic or electrophilic catalyst activator compounds (also known as “co-catalyst” compounds) respectively, examples of which are described below. The activatable ligand X may also be transformed into another ligand which is cleaved or abstracted from the metal center M (e.g. a halide may be converted to an alkyl group). Without wishing to be bound by any single theory, protonolysis or abstraction reactions generate an active “cationic” metal center which can polymerize olefins. In embodiments of the present invention, the activatable ligand, X is independently selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom; a halogen atom, a C1-10 hydrocarbyl radical; a C1-10 alkoxy radical; and a C6-10 aryl or aryloxy radical, where each of the hydrocarbyl, alkoxy, aryl, or aryl oxide radicals may be un-substituted or further substituted by one or more halogen or other group; a C1-8 alkyl; a C1-5 alkoxy, a C6-10 aryl or aryloxy; an amido or a phosphido radical, but where X is not a cyclopentadienyl. Two X ligands may also be joined to one another and form for example, a substituted or unsubstituted diene ligand (i.e. 1,3-butadiene); or a delocalized heteroatom containing group such as an acetate or acetamidinate group. In a convenient embodiment of the invention, each X is independently selected from the group consisting of a halide atom, a C1-4 alkyl radical and a benzyl radical. Particularly suitable activatable ligands are monoanionic such as a halide (e.g. chloride) or a hydrocarbyl (e.g. methyl, benzyl). The catalyst activator (or simply the “activator” for short) used to activate the transition metal polymerization catalyst can be any suitable activator including one or more activators selected from the group consisting of alkylaluminoxanes and ionic activators, optionally together with an alkylating agent. Without wishing to be bound by theory, alkylaluminoxanes are thought to be complex aluminum compounds of the formula: R32Al1O(R3Al1O)mAl1R32, wherein each R3 is independently selected from the group consisting of C1-20 hydrocarbyl radicals and m is from about 3 to about 50. Optionally a hindered phenol can be added to the alkylaluminoxane to provide a molar ratio of Al1:hindered phenol of from about 2:1 to about 5:1 when the hindered phenol is present. In an embodiment of the invention, R3 of the alkylaluminoxane, is a methyl radical and m is from about 10 to about 40. The alkylaluminoxanes are typically used in substantial molar excess compared to the amount of group 4 transition metal in the organometallic compound/complex. The Al1:group 4 transition metal molar ratios may be from about 10:1 to about 10,000:1, or from about 30:1 to about 500:1. In an embodiment of the invention, the catalyst activator is methylaluminoxane (MAO). In an embodiment of the invention, the catalyst activator is modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO). It is well known in the art, that the alkylaluminoxane can serve dual roles as both an alkylator and an activator. Hence, an alkylaluminoxane activator is often used in combination with activatable ligands such as halogens. Alternatively, the catalyst activator may be a combination of an alkylating agent (which may also serve as a scavenger) with an activator capable of ionizing the group 4 of the transition metal catalyst (i.e. an ionic activator). In this context, the activator can be chosen from one or more alkylaluminoxane and/or an ionic activator, since an alkylaluminoxane may serve as both an activator and an alkylating agent. When present, the alkylating agent may be selected from the group consisting of (R4)pMgX22-p wherein X2 is a halide and each R4 is independently selected from the group consisting of C1-10 alkyl radicals and p is 1 or 2; R4Li wherein in R4 is as defined above, (R4)qZnX22-q wherein R4 is as defined above, X2 is halogen and q is 1 or 2; (R4)sAl2X23-s wherein R4 is as defined above, X2 is halogen and s is an integer from 1 to 3. In some embodiments, in the above compounds R4 is a C1-4 alkyl radical, and X2 is chlorine. Commercially available compounds include triethyl aluminum (TEAL), diethyl aluminum chloride (DEAC), dibutyl magnesium ((Bu)2Mg), and butyl ethyl magnesium (BuEtMg or BuMgEt). Alkylaluminoxanes can also be used as alkylating agents.

In an embodiment of the invention, the ionic activator compounds may be used in amounts which provide a molar ratio of group 4 transition metal to boron that will be from about 1:1 to about 1:6. Optionally, mixtures of alkylaluminoxanes and ionic activators can be used as activators for the organometallic complex. In some embodiments of the current invention, the polymerization catalyst system may comprise an inert support (note: the terms “support” and “inert support” are used interchangeably herein). In one embodiment of the invention, the polymerization catalyst system comprises a phosphinimine catalyst which is supported on an inert support. The inert support can be any support known in the art to be suitable for use with polymerization catalysts. For example the support can be any porous or non-porous support material, such as talc, inorganic oxides, inorganic chlorides, aluminophosphates (i.e. AlPO4) and polymer supports (e.g. polystyrene, etc). Hence, supports include Group 2, 3, 4, 5, 13 and 14 metal oxides generally, such as silica, alumina, silica-alumina, magnesium oxide, magnesium chloride, zirconia, titania, clay (e.g. montmorillonite) and mixtures thereof. Agglomerate supports such as agglomerates of silica and clay may also be used as a support. Supports are generally used in calcined form. An inorganic oxide support, for example, will contain acidic surface hydroxyl groups which will react with a polymerization catalyst. Prior to use, the inorganic oxide may be dehydrated to remove water and to reduce the concentration of surface hydroxyl groups. Calcination or dehydration of a support is well known in the art. In an embodiment of the invention, the support is calcined at temperatures above about 200° C., or above about 300° C., or above about 400° C., or above about 500° C. In other embodiments, the support is calcined at from about 500° C. to about 1000° C., or from about 600° C. to about 900° C. The resulting support may be free of adsorbed water and may have a surface hydroxyl content from about 0.1 to about 5 mmol/g of support, or from about 0.5 to about 3 mmol/g. The amount of hydroxyl groups in a silica support may be determined according to the method disclosed by J. B. Peri and A. L. Hensley Jr., in J. Phys. Chem., 72 (8), 1968, pg 2926. The support material, especially an inorganic oxide, typically has a surface area of from about 10 to about 700 m2/g, a pore volume in the range from about 0.1 to about 4.0 cc/g and an average particle size of from about 5 to about 500 μm. In a more specific embodiment, the support material has a surface area of from about 50 to about 500 m2/g, a pore volume in the range from about 0.5 to about 3.5 cc/g and an average particle size of from about 10 to about 200 μm. In another more specific embodiment the support material has a surface area of from about 100 to about 400 m2/g, a pore volume in the range from about 0.8 to about 3.0 cc/g and an average particle size of from about 5 to about 100 μm. The support material, especially an inorganic oxide, typically has an average pore size (i.e. pore diameter) of from about 10 to about 1000 Angstroms(Å). In a more specific embodiment, the support material has an average pore size of from about 50 to about 500 Å. In another more specific embodiment, the support material has an average pore size of from about 75 to about 350 Å. The surface area and pore volume of a support may be determined by nitrogen adsorption according to B.E.T. techniques, which are well known in the art and are described in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, 1938, v 60, pg 309-319. A suitable silica support has a high surface area and is amorphous. By way of example only, useful silicas are commercially available under the trademark of Sylopol® 958, 955 and 2408 by the Davison Catalysts, a Division of W. R. Grace and Company and ES-70W by Ineos Silica. Agglomerate supports comprising a clay mineral and an inorganic oxide, may be prepared using a number techniques well known in the art including pelletizing, extrusion, drying or precipitation, spray-drying, shaping into beads in a rotating coating drum, and the like. A nodulization technique may also be used. Methods to make agglomerate supports comprising a clay mineral and an inorganic oxide include spray-drying a slurry of a clay mineral and an inorganic oxide. Methods to make agglomerate supports comprising a clay mineral and an inorganic oxide are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,686,306; 6,399,535; 6,734,131; 6,559,090 and 6,958,375. An agglomerate of clay and inorganic oxide may have the following properties: a surface area of from about 20 to about 800 m2/g, or from about 50 to about 600 m2/g; particles with a bulk density of from about 0.15 to about 1 g/ml, or from about 0.20 to about 0.75 g/ml; an average pore diameter of from about 30 to about 300 Angstroms (Å), or from about 60 to about 150 Å; a total pore volume of from about 0.10 to about 2.0 cc/g, or from about 0.5 to about 1.8 cc/g; and an average particle size of from about 4 to about 250 microns (μm), or from about 8 to about 100 microns. Alternatively, a support, for example a silica support, may be treated with one or more salts of the type: Zr(SO4)2.4H2O, ZrO(NO3)2, and Fe(NO3)3 as taught in co-pending Canadian Patent Application No. 2,716,772. Supports that have been otherwise chemically treated are also contemplated for use with the catalysts and processes described herein. The present invention is not limited to any particular procedure for supporting a transition metal catalyst or catalyst system components. Processes for depositing such catalysts (e.g. a phosphinimine catalyst) as well as a catalyst activator on a support are well known in the art (for some non-limiting examples of catalyst supporting methods, see “Supported Catalysts” by James H. Clark and Duncan J. Macquarrie, published online Nov. 15, 2002 in the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology Copyright © 2001 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.; for some non-limiting methods to support an organotransition metal catalyst see U.S. Pat. No. 5,965,677). For example, a transition metal catalyst (e.g. a phosphinimine catalyst) may be added to a support by co-precipitation with the support material. The activator can be added to the support before and/or after the transition metal catalyst or together with the transition metal catalyst. Optionally, the activator can be added to a supported transition metal catalyst in situ or a transition metal catalyst may be added to the support in situ or a transition metal catalyst can be added to a supported activator in situ. A transition metal catalyst may be slurried or dissolved in a suitable diluent or solvent and then added to the support. Suitable solvents or diluents include but are not limited to hydrocarbons and mineral oil. A transition metal catalyst for example, may be added to the solid support, in the form of a solid, solution or slurry, followed by the addition of the activator in solid form or as a solution or slurry. Transition metal catalyst (e.g. phosphinimine catalyst), catalyst activator, and support can be mixed together in the presence or absence of a solvent. Polymerization Process Copolymer compositions can be made using a single reactor, for example, a single gas phase or slurry phase reactor. A polymerization catalyst system comprising a single transition metal catalyst in a single gas phase reactor may be used. Detailed descriptions of slurry polymerization processes are widely reported in the patent literature. For example, particle form polymerization, or a slurry process where the temperature is kept below the temperature at which the polymer goes into solution is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,248,179. Other slurry processes include those employing a loop reactor and those utilizing a plurality of stirred reactors in series, parallel, or combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of slurry processes include continuous loop or stirred tank processes. Further examples of slurry processes are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,613,484. Slurry processes are conducted in the presence of a hydrocarbon diluent such as an alkane (including isoalkanes), an aromatic or a cycloalkane. The diluent may also be the alpha olefin comonomer used in copolymerizations. Alkane diluents include propane, butanes, (i.e. normal butane and/or isobutane), pentanes, hexanes, heptanes and octanes. The monomers may be soluble in (or miscible with) the diluent, but the polymer is not (under polymerization conditions). The polymerization temperature may be from about 5° C. to about 200° C., or less than about 120° C. typically from about 10° C. to about 100° C. The reaction temperature is selected so that the ethylene copolymer is produced in the form of solid particles. The reaction pressure is influenced by the choice of diluent and reaction temperature. For example, pressures may range from about 15 to about 45 atmospheres (about 220 to about 660 psi or about 1500 to about 4600 kPa) when isobutane is used as diluent (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,325,849) to approximately twice that (i.e. from about 30 to about 90 atmospheres—about 440 to about 1300 psi or about 3000-9100 kPa) when propane is used (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,684,097). The pressure in a slurry process is kept sufficiently high to keep at least part of the ethylene monomer in the liquid phase. The reaction typically takes place in a jacketed closed loop reactor having an internal stirrer (e.g. an impeller) and at least one settling leg. Catalyst, monomers and diluents are fed to the reactor as liquids or suspensions. The slurry circulates through the reactor and the jacket is used to control the temperature of the reactor. Through a series of let-down valves the slurry enters a settling leg and then is let down in pressure to flash the diluent and unreacted monomers and recover the polymer generally in a cyclone. The diluent and unreacted monomers are recovered and recycled back to the reactor. A gas phase polymerization process is commonly carried out in a fluidized bed reactor. Such gas phase processes are widely described in the literature (see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,543,399, 4,588,790, 5,028,670, 5,317,036, 5,352,749, 5,405,922, 5,436,304, 5,453,471, 5,462,999, 5,616,661 and 5,668,228). In general, a fluidized bed gas phase polymerization reactor employs a “bed” of polymer and catalyst which is fluidized by a flow of monomer, comonomer and other optional components which are at least partially gaseous. Heat is generated by the enthalpy of polymerization of the monomer (and comonomers) flowing through the bed. Un-reacted monomer, comonomer and other optional gaseous components exit the fluidized bed and are contacted with a cooling system to remove this heat. The cooled gas stream, including monomer, comonomer and optional other components (such as condensable liquids), is then re-circulated through the polymerization zone, together with “make-up” monomer (and comonomer) to replace that which was polymerized on the previous pass. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the “fluidized” nature of the polymerization bed helps to evenly distribute/mix the heat of reaction and thereby minimize the formation of localized temperature gradients. The reactor pressure in a gas phase process may vary from about atmospheric to about 600 psig. In a more specific embodiment, the pressure can range from about 100 psig (about 690 kPa) to about 500 psig (about 3448 kPa). In another more specific embodiment, the pressure can range from about 200 psig (about 1379 kPa) to about 400 psig (about 2759 kPa). In yet another more specific embodiment, the pressure can range from about 250 psig (about 1724 kPa) to about 350 psig (about 2414 kPa). The reactor temperature in a gas phase process may vary according to the heat of polymerization as described above. In a specific embodiment, the reactor temperature can be from about 30° C. to about 130° C. In another specific embodiment, the reactor temperature can be from about 60° C. to about 120° C. In yet another specific embodiment, the reactor temperature can be from about 70° C. to about 110° C. In still yet another specific embodiment, the temperature of a gas phase process can be from about 70° C. to about 100° C. The fluidized bed process described above is well adapted for the preparation of polyethylene but other monomers (i.e. comonomers) may also be employed. Monomers and comonomers include ethylene and C3-12 alpha olefins respectively, where C3-12 alpha olefins are unsubstituted or substituted by up to two C1-6 alkyl radicals, C8-12 vinyl aromatic monomers which are unsubstituted or substituted by up to two substituents selected from the group consisting of C1-4 alkyl radicals, C4-12 straight chained or cyclic diolefins which are unsubstituted or substituted by a C1-4 alkyl radical. Illustrative non-limiting examples of such alpha-olefins are one or more of propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, and 1-decene, styrene, alpha methyl styrene, p-tert-butyl styrene, and the constrained-ring cyclic olefins such as cyclobutene, cyclopentene, dicyclopentadiene norbornene, alkyl-substituted norbornenes, alkenyl-substituted norbornenes and the like (e.g. 5-methylene-2-norbornene and 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene, bicyclo-(2,2,1)-hepta-2,5-diene). In one embodiment, the invention is directed toward a polymerization process involving the polymerization of ethylene with one or more of comonomer(s) including linear or branched comonomer(s) having from 3 to 30 carbon atoms, or 3-12 carbon atoms, or 3 to 8 carbon atoms. The process is particularly well suited to the copolymerization reactions involving the polymerization of ethylene in combination with one or more of the comonomers, for example alpha-olefin comonomers such as propylene, butene-1, pentene-1,4-methylpentene-1, hexene-1, octene-1, decene-1, styrene and cyclic and polycyclic olefins such as cyclopentene, norbornene and cyclohexene or a combination thereof. Other comonomers for use with ethylene can include polar vinyl monomers, diolefins such as 1,3-butadiene, 1,4-pentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 1,5-hexadiene, norbornadiene, and other unsaturated monomers including acetylene and aldehyde monomers. Higher alpha-olefins and polyenes or macromers can be used also. The comonomer is an alpha-olefin having from 3 to 15 carbon atoms, or from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, or from 4 to 10 carbon atoms. In an embodiment of the invention, ethylene comprises at least about 75 wt % of the total weight of monomer (i.e. ethylene) and comonomer (i.e. alpha olefin) that is fed to a polymerization reactor. In an embodiment of the invention, ethylene comprises at least about 85 wt % of the total weight of monomer (i.e. ethylene) and comonomer (i.e. alpha olefin) that is fed to a polymerization reactor. In an embodiment of the invention, ethylene is polymerized with at least two different comonomers to form a terpolymer and the like. Examples of comonomers are a combination of monomers, such as, alpha-olefin monomers having 3 to 10 carbon atoms, or 3 to 8 carbon atoms, optionally with at least one diene monomer. Example terpolymers include combinations such as ethylene/butene-1/hexene-1, ethylene/propylene/butene-1, ethylene/propylene/hexene-1, ethylene/propylene/norbornadiene, ethylene/propylene/1,4-hexadiene and the like.

The polymerization catalyst system may be fed to a reactor system in a number of ways. If the transition metal catalyst is supported on a suitable support, the transition metal catalyst may be fed to a reactor in dry mode using a dry catalyst feeder, examples of which are well known in the art. Alternatively, a supported transition metal catalyst may be fed to a reactor as a slurry in a suitable diluent. If the transition metal catalyst is unsupported, the catalyst can be fed to a reactor as a solution or as a slurry in a suitable solvent or diluents. Polymerization catalyst system components, which may include a transition metal catalyst, an activator, a scavenger, an inert support, and a catalyst modifier, may be combined prior to their addition to a polymerization zone, or they may be combined on route to a polymerization zone. To combine polymerization catalyst system components on route to a polymerization zone they can be fed as solutions or slurries (in suitable solvents or diluents) using various feed line configurations which may become coterminous before reaching the reactor. Such configurations can be designed to provide areas in which catalyst system components flowing to a reactor can mix and react with one another over various “hold up” times which can be moderated by changing the solution or slurry flow rates of the catalyst system components. Catalyst Modifier A “catalyst modifier” is a compound which, when added to a polymerization catalyst system or used in the presence of the same in appropriate amounts, can reduce, prevent or mitigate at least one: of fouling, sheeting, temperature excursions, and static level of a material in polymerization reactor; can alter catalyst kinetics; and/or can alter the properties of copolymer product obtained in a polymerization process. A long chain amine type catalyst modifier may be added to a reactor zone (or associated process equipment) separately from the polymerization catalyst system, as part of the polymerization catalyst system, or both as described in co-pending CA Pat. Appl. No. 2,742,461. The long chain amine can be a long chain substituted monoalkanolamine, or a long chain substituted dialkanolamine as described in co-pending CA Pat. Appl.

Non limiting examples of catalyst modifiers which can be used are Kemamine AS990™, Kemamine AS650™, Armostat-1800™, bis-hydroxy-cocoamine, 2,2′-octadecyl-amino-bisethanol, and Atmer163™. The amount of catalyst modifier added to a reactor (or other associated process equipment) is conveniently represented herein as the parts per million (ppm) of catalyst modifier based on the weight of copolymer produced. The amount of catalyst modifier included in a polymerization catalyst system is conveniently represented herein as a weight percent (wt %) of the catalyst modifier based on the total weight of the polymerization catalyst system (e.g. the combined weight of the transition metal catalyst, the inert support, the cocatalyst and the catalyst modifier). The catalyst modifier may be added to a polymerization reactor in a number of ways. The catalyst modifier may be added to a reactor system separately from the polymerization catalyst system or it may be combined with the polymerization catalyst system prior to feeding the combination to a reactor system. If the catalyst modifier is added to the polymerization catalyst system prior to its addition to a reactor, then the catalyst modifier can be added at any point during the preparation of the polymerization catalyst system. Thus, one transition metal catalyst, at least one activator, at least one inert support and at least one catalyst modifier may be combined in any order to form a polymerization catalyst system suitable for use. In specific embodiments of the invention: the catalyst modifier may be added to a support after both the transition metal catalyst and the cocatalyst have been added; the catalyst modifier may be added to a support before either of the transition metal catalyst or the cocatalyst are added; the catalyst modifier may be added to a support after the transition metal catalyst but before the cocatalyst; the catalyst modifier may be added to a support after the cocatalyst but before the transition metal catalyst. Also, the catalyst modifier can be added in portions during any stage of the preparation of the polymerization catalyst system. The catalyst modifier may be included in the polymerization catalyst system (or where appropriate, added to a polymerization catalyst system component or components which may comprise one transition metal catalyst, the inert support and the cocatalyst) in any suitable manner. By way of non-limiting example, the catalyst modifier may be dry blended (if it is a solid) with the polymerization catalyst system (or a polymerization catalyst system component) or it may be added neat (if the catalyst modifier is a liquid) or it may be added as solution or slurry in a suitable hydrocarbon solvent or diluent respectively. The polymerization catalyst system (or polymerization catalyst system components) can likewise be put into solution or made into a slurry using suitable solvents or diluents respectively, followed by addition of the catalyst modifier (as a neat solid or liquid or as a solution or a slurry in suitable solvents or diluents) or vice versa. Alternatively, the catalyst modifier may be deposited onto a separate support and the resulting supported catalyst modifier blended either dry or in a slurry with the polymerization catalyst system (or a polymerization catalyst system component). In an embodiment of the present invention, the catalyst modifier is added to a polymerization catalyst system already comprising the single transition metal catalyst, inert support and cocatalyst. The catalyst modifier can be added to the polymerization catalyst system offline and prior to addition of the polymerization catalyst system to the polymerization zone, or the catalyst modifier may be added to the polymerization catalyst system, or components on route to a polymerization reactor. The catalyst modifier may be fed to a reactor system using any appropriate method known to persons skilled in the art. For example, the catalyst modifier may be fed to a reactor system as a solution or as a slurry in a suitable solvent or diluent respectively. Suitable solvents or diluents are inert hydrocarbons well known to persons skilled in the art and generally include aromatics, paraffins, and cycloparaffinics such as for example benzene, toluene, xylene, cyclohexane, fuel oil, isobutane, mineral oil, kerosene and the like. Further specific examples include but are not limited to hexane, heptanes, isopentane and mixtures thereof. Alternatively, the catalyst modifier may be added to an inert support material and then fed to a polymerization reactor as a dry feed or a slurry feed. The catalyst modifier may be fed to various locations in a reactor system. When considering a fluidized bed process for example, the catalyst modifier may be fed directly to any area of the reaction zone (for example, when added as a solution), or any area of the entrainment zone, or it may be fed to any area within the recycle loop, where such areas are found to be effective sites at which to feed a catalyst modifier. When added as a solution or mixture with a solvent or diluent respectively, the catalyst modifier may make up, for example, from about 0.1 to about 30 wt % of the solution or mixture, or from about 0.1 to about 20 wt %, or from about 0.1 to about 10 wt %, or from about 0.1 to about 5 wt % or from about 0.1 to about 2.5 wt % or from about 0.2 to about 2.0 wt %, although a person skilled in the art will recognize that further, possibly broader ranges, may also be used and so some embodiments of the invention should not be limited in this regard. The catalyst modifier can be added to a reactor with all or a portion of one or more of the monomers or the cycle gas. The catalyst modifier can be added to a reactor through a dedicated feed line or added to any convenient feed stream including an ethylene feed stream, a comonomer feed stream, a catalyst feed line or a recycle line. The catalyst modifier can be fed to a location in a fluidized bed system in a continuous or intermittent manner. In an embodiment of the invention, the rate of addition of a catalyst modifier to a reactor will be programmed using measured reactor static levels (or other lead indicators such as reactor temperature) as programming inputs, so as to maintain a constant or pre-determined level of static (or for example, temperature) in a polymerization reactor. The catalyst modifier can be added to a reactor at a time before, after or during the start of the polymerization reaction. The catalyst modifier may be added to the polymerization catalyst system or to one or more polymerization catalyst system components (e.g. a phosphinimine catalyst, inert support, or cocatalyst) on route to a reaction zone. In an embodiment of the invention, the catalyst modifier is added directly to a reaction zone, separately from the polymerization catalyst system. Most typically, it is so added by spraying a solution or mixture of the catalyst modifier directly into a reaction zone. In an embodiment of the invention, the catalyst modifier is included (combined) with the polymerization catalyst system before adding the combination directly to a reaction zone. In an embodiment of the invention, the catalyst modifier is added to a polymer seed bed present in a reactor prior to starting the polymerization reaction by introduction of a catalyst. In an embodiment of the invention, the catalyst modifier is added directly to a reaction zone, separately from a polymerization catalyst system, and the catalyst modifier is added as a mixture with an inert hydrocarbon. In an embodiment of the invention, the catalyst modifier is added directly to a reaction zone, separately from a polymerization catalyst system, and the catalyst modifier is added as a mixture with an inert hydrocarbon, and is added during a polymerization reaction. The total amount of catalyst modifier that may be fed to a reactor and/or included in the polymerization catalyst system is not specifically limited, but it should not exceed an amount which causes the organotransition metal based polymerization catalyst system activity to drop to below that which would be commercially acceptable. In this regard, the amount of catalyst modifier fed to a reactor will generally not exceed about 150 ppm, or about 100 ppm, or about 75 ppm, or about 50 ppm, or about 25 ppm (parts per million based on the weight of the (co)polymer being produced) while the amount of catalyst modifier included in the polymerization catalyst system will generally not exceed about 10 weight percent (based on the total weight of the polymerization catalyst system, including the catalyst modifier). In embodiments of the invention, the catalyst modifier fed to a reactor will be from about 150 to 0 ppm, and including narrower ranges within this range, such as but not limited to, from about 150 to about 1 ppm, or from about 150 to about 5 ppm, or from about 100 to 0 ppm, or from about 100 to about 1 ppm, or from about 100 to about 5 ppm, or from about 75 to 0 ppm, or from about 75 to about 1 ppm, or from about 75 to about 5 ppm, or from about 50 to 0 ppm, or from about 50 to about 1 ppm, or from about 50 to about 5 ppm, or from about 25 to 0 ppm, or from about 25 to about 1 ppm, or from about 25 to about 5 ppm (parts per million by weight of the polymer being produced). In embodiments of the invention, the amount of catalyst modifier included in the polymerization catalyst system will be from 0 to about 10 weight percent, and including narrower ranges within this range, such as but not limited to, from 0 to about 6.0 weight percent, or from about 0.25 to about 6.0 weight percent, or from 0 to about 5.0 weight percent, or from about 0.25 to about 5.0 weight percent, or from 0 to about 4.5 weight percent, or from about 0.5 to about 4.5 weight percent, or from about 1.0 to about 4.5 weight percent, or from about 0.75 to about 4.0 weight percent, or from 0 to about 4.0 weight percent, or from about 0.5 to about 4.0 weight percent, or from about 1.0 to about 4.0 weight percent, or from 0 to about 3.75 weight percent, or from about 0.25 to about 3.75 weight percent, or from about 0.5 to about 3.5 weight percent, or from about 1.25 to about 3.75 weight percent, or from about 1.0 to about 3.5 weight percent, or from about 1.5 to about 3.5 weight percent, or from about 0.75 to about 3.75 weight percent, or from about 1.0 to about 3.75 weight percent (wt % is the weight percent of the catalyst modifier based on the total weight of the polymerization catalyst system; e.g. the combined weight of an organotransition metal catalyst, an inert support, a catalyst activator and a catalyst modifier). Other catalyst modifiers may be used and include compounds such as carboxylate metal salts (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,354,880; 6,300,436; 6,306,984; 6,391,819; 6,472,342 and 6,608,153 for examples), polysulfones, polymeric polyamines and sulfonic acids (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,562,924; 6,022,935 and 5,283,278 for examples). Polyoxyethylenealkylamines, which are described in for example in European Pat. Appl. No. 107,127, may also be used. Further catalyst modifiers include aluminum stearate and aluminum oleate. Catalyst modifiers are supplied commercially under the trademarks OCTASTAT™ and STADIS™. The catalyst modifier STADIS is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,476,715; 6,562,924 and 5,026,795 and is available from Octel Starreon. STADIS generally comprises a polysulfone copolymer, a polymeric amine and an oil soluble sulfonic acid. Commercially available catalyst modifiers sometimes contain unacceptable amounts of water for use with polymerization catalysts. Accordingly, the catalyst modifier may be treated with a substance which removes water (e.g. by reaction therewith to form inert products, or adsorption or absorption methods), such as a metal alkyl scavenger or molecular sieves. See for example, U.S. Pat. Appl. Pub. No. 2011/0184124 for use of a scavenger compound to remove water from a metal carboxylate antistatic agent. Alternatively, a catalyst modifier may be dried under reduced pressure and elevated temperatures to reduce the amount of water present (see the Examples section below). For example, a catalyst modifier may be treated with elevated temperatures (e.g. at least about 10° C. above room temperature or ambient temperature) under reduced pressure (e.g. below atmospheric pressure) to distill off water, as can be achieved by using a dynamic vacuum pump. Scavenger Optionally, scavengers are added to the polymerization process. Any suitable scavenger or scavengers can be used. Scavengers are well known in the art. In an embodiment of the invention, scavengers are organoaluminum compounds having the formula: Al3(X3)n(X4)3-n, where (X3) is a hydrocarbyl having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms; (X4) is selected from alkoxide or aryloxide, any one of which having from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms; halide; or hydride; and n is a number from 1 to 3, inclusive; or alkylaluminoxanes having the formula: R32Al1O(R3Al1O)mAl1R32 wherein each R3 is independently selected from the group consisting of C1-20 hydrocarbyl radicals and m is from about 3 to about 50. Some non-limiting examples of scavengers include triisobutylaluminum, triethylaluminum, trimethylaluminum or other trialkylaluminum compounds. The scavenger may be used in any suitable amount but by way of non-limiting examples only, can be present in an amount to provide a molar ratio of Al:M (where M is the metal of the organometallic compound) of from about 20 to about 2000, or from about 50 to about 1000, or from about 100 to about 500. Generally the scavenger is added to the reactor prior to the catalyst and in the absence of additional poisons and over time declines to about 0, or is added continuously. Optionally, the scavengers may be independently supported. For example, an inorganic oxide that has been treated with an organoaluminum compound or alkylaluminoxane may be added to the polymerization reactor. The method of addition of the organoaluminum or alkylaluminoxane compounds to the support is not specifically defined and is carried out by procedures well known in the art. The Ethylene Copolymer Composition The term “ethylene copolymer” is used herein interchangeably with the term “copolymer”, or “polyethylene copolymer” and all connote a polymer consisting of polymerized ethylene units and at least one type of polymerized alpha olefin. In some embodiments of the present invention, the ethylene copolymer compositions are not polymer blends, but optionally they may be used as a component in a polymer blend. The term polymer “blend” is herein meant to connote a dry blend of two dissimilar or different polymers, in-reactor blends arising from the use of multi or mixed catalyst systems in a single reactor zone, and blends that result from the use of one catalyst in at least two reactors operating under different polymerization conditions, or blends involving the use of at least two distinct catalysts in one or more reactors under the same or different conditions (e.g. a blend resulting from in series reactors each running under different conditions or with different catalysts). In one embodiment, the ethylene copolymer compositions are copolymers of ethylene and an alpha olefin selected from 1-butene, 1-hexene and 1-octene. In embodiments of the invention, the ethylene copolymer composition will comprise at least about 75 weight % of ethylene units, or at least about 80 wt % of ethylene units, or at least about 85 wt % of ethylene units with the balance being an alpha-olefin unit, based on the weight of the ethylene copolymer composition.

In embodiments of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will have a melt index (I2) of from greater than about 1.0 to about 2.0 g/10 min, or from greater than about 1.0 to about 1.75 g/10 min, or from greater than about 1.0 to about 1.5 g/10 min. In embodiments of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will have a density of from about 0.916 g/cc to about 0.936 g/cc including narrower ranges within this range, such as for example, from about 0.916 g/cc to about 0.935 g/cc, or from about 0.916 g/cc to about 0.932 g/cc, or from about 0.916 g/cc to about 0.930 g/cc, or from about 0.917 g/cc to about 0.932 g/cc, or from about 0.916 g/cc to about 0.930 g/cc, or from about 0.917 g/cc to about 0.930 g/cc, or from about 0.916 g/cc to about 0.925 g/cc, or from about 0.917 g/cc to about 0.927 g/cc, or from about 0.917 g/cc to about 0.926 g/cc, or from about 0.917 g/cc to about 0.925 g/cc, or from about 0.917 g/cc to about 0.923 g/cc, or from about 0.918 g/cc to about 0.932 g/cc, or from about 0.918 g/cc to about 0.930 g/cc, or from about 0.918 to about 0.930 g/cc, or from about 0.918 to about 0.928 g/cc, or from about 0.920 to about 0.935 (note: “g” stands for gram; “cc” stands for cubic centimeter, cm3) In an embodiment of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will have a density of from about 0.916 g/cc to about 0.936 g/cc. In an embodiment of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will have a density of greater than about 0.916 g/cc to less than about 0.930 g/cc. In an embodiment of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will have a density of from about 0.917 g/cc to about 0.927 g/cc. In an embodiment of the invention, the ethylene copolymer composition will have a density of from about 0.918 g/cc to about 0.927 g/cc. The ethylene copolymers may have a unimodal, broad unimodal, bimodal, or multimodal profile in a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) curve generated according to the method of ASTM D6474-99. The term “unimodal” is herein defined to mean there will be only one significant peak or maximum evident in the GPC-curve. A unimodal profile includes a broad unimodal profile. By the term “bimodal” it is meant that in addition to a first peak, there will be a secondary peak or shoulder which represents a higher or lower molecular weight component (i.e. the molecular weight distribution, can be said to have two maxima in a molecular weight distribution curve). Alternatively, the term “bimodal” connotes the presence of two maxima in a molecular weight distribution curve generated according to the method of ASTM D6474-99. The term “multi-modal” denotes the presence of two or more maxima in a molecular weight distribution curve generated according to the method of ASTM D6474-99. In an embodiment of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will have a unimodal profile in a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) curve generated according to the method of ASTM D6474-99 In embodiments of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will exhibit a weight average molecular weight (MW) as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of from about 30,000 to about 250,000, including narrower ranges within this range, such as for example, from about 50,000 to about 200,000, or from about 50,000 to about 175,000, or from about 75,000 to about 150,000, or from about 80,000 to about 130,000. In embodiments of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will exhibit a number average molecular weight (Mn) as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of from about 5,000 to about 100,000 including narrower ranges within this range, such as for example from about 7,500 to about 100,000, or from about 7,500 to about 75,000, or from about 7,500 to about 50,000, or from about 10,000 to about 100,000, or from about 10,000 to about 75,000, or from about 10,000 to about 50,000. In embodiments of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will exhibit a Z-average molecular weight (MZ) as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of from about 50,000 to about 1,000,000 including narrower ranges within this range, such as for example from about 75,000 to about 750,000, or from about 100,000 to about 500,000, or from about 100,000 to about 400,000, or from about 125,000 to about 375,000, or from about 150,000 to about 350,000, or from about 175,000 to about 375,000, or from about 175,000 to about 400,000, or from about 200,000 to about 400,000 or from about 225,000 to about 375,000. In embodiments of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will have a molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of from about 3.5 to about 7.0, including narrower ranges within this range, such as for example, from about 3.5 to about 6.5, or from about 3.6 to about 6.5, or from about 3.6 to about 6.0, or from about 3.5 to about 5.5, or from about 3.6 to about 5.5, or from about 3.5 to about 5.0, or from about 4.5 to about 6.0, or from about 4.0 to about 6.0, or from about 4.0 to about 5.5. In embodiments of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will have a Z average molecular weight distribution (Mz/Mw) as determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of from about 2.0 to about 5.5, including narrower ranges within this range, such as for example, from about 2.0 to about 5.0, or from about 2.0 to about 4.5, or from about 2.0 to about 4.0, or from about 2.0 to about 2.5, or from about 2.0 to about 3.0, or from about 2.0 to about 3.5. In an embodiment of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will have a flat comonomer incorporation profile as measured using Gel-Permeation Chromatography with Fourier Transform Infra-Red detection (GPC-FTIR). In an embodiment of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will have a negative (i.e. “normal”) comonomer incorporation profile as measured using GPC-FTIR. In an embodiment of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will have an inverse (i.e. “reverse”) or partially inverse comonomer incorporation profile as measured using GPC-FTIR. If the comonomer incorporation decreases with molecular weight, as measured using GPC-FTIR, the distribution is described as “normal” or “negative”. If the comonomer incorporation is approximately constant with molecular weight, as measured using GPC-FTIR, the comonomer distribution is described as “flat” or “uniform”. The terms “reverse comonomer distribution” and “partially reverse comonomer distribution” mean that in the GPC-FTIR data obtained for the copolymer, there is one or more higher molecular weight components having a higher comonomer incorporation than in one or more lower molecular weight segments. The term “reverse(d) comonomer distribution” is used herein to mean, that across the molecular weight range of the ethylene copolymer, comonomer contents for the various polymer fractions are not substantially uniform and the higher molecular weight fractions thereof have proportionally higher comonomer contents (i.e. if the comonomer incorporation rises with molecular weight, the distribution is described as “reverse” or “reversed”). Where the comonomer incorporation rises with increasing molecular weight and then declines, the comonomer distribution is still considered “reverse”, but may also be described as “partially reverse”. In an embodiment of the invention the ethylene copolymer has a reversed comonomer incorporation profile as measured using GPC-FTIR. In an embodiment of the invention, the ethylene copolymer will have a comonomer incorporation profile as determined by GPC-FTIR which satisfies the following condition: SCB/1000C at MW of 200,000−SCB/1000C at MW of 50,000 is a greater than 0; where “−” is a minus sign, SCB/1000C is the comonomer content determined as the number of short chain branches per thousand carbons and MW is the corresponding molecular weight (i.e. the absolute molecular weight) on a GPC or GPC-FTIR chromatograph.

Film Production The extrusion-blown film process is a well-known process for the preparation of plastic film. The process employs an extruder which heats, melts and conveys the molten plastic and forces it through an annular die. Typical extrusion temperatures are from about 330 to about 500° F., especially about 350 to about 460° F. The polyethylene copolymer film is drawn from the die and formed into a tube shape and eventually passed through a pair of draw or nip rollers. Internal compressed air is then introduced from a mandrel causing the tube to increase in diameter forming a “bubble” of the desired size. Thus, the blown film is stretched in two directions, namely in the axial direction (by the use of forced air which “blows out” the diameter of the bubble) and in the lengthwise direction of the bubble (by the action of a winding element which pulls the bubble through the machinery). External air is also introduced around the bubble circumference to cool the melt as it exits the die. Film width is varied by introducing more or less internal air into the bubble thus increasing or decreasing the bubble size. Film thickness is controlled primarily by increasing or decreasing the speed of the draw roll or nip roll to control the draw-down rate. The bubble is then collapsed immediately after passing through the draw or nip rolls. The cooled film can then be processed further by cutting or sealing to produce a variety of consumer products. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is generally believed by those skilled in the art of manufacturing blown films that the physical properties of the finished films are influenced by both the molecular structure of the ethylene copolymer and by the processing conditions. For example, the processing conditions are thought to influence the degree of molecular orientation (in both the machine direction and the axial or cross direction). A balance of “machine direction” (“MD”) and “transverse direction” (“TD”—which is perpendicular to MD) molecular orientation is generally considered desirable for the films associated with some embodiments of the invention (for example, Dart Impact strength, Machine Direction and Transverse Direction tear properties may be affected). Thus, it is recognized that these stretching forces on the “bubble” can affect the physical properties of the finished film. In particular, it is known that the “blow up ratio” (i.e. the ratio of the diameter of the blown bubble to the diameter of the annular die) can have a significant effect upon the dart impact strength and tear strength of the finished film. The above description relates to the preparation of monolayer films. Multilayer films may be prepared by 1) a “co-extrusion” process that allows more than one stream of molten polymer to be introduced to an annular die resulting in a multi-layered film membrane or 2) a lamination process in which film layers are laminated together. In an embodiment of the invention, the films of this invention are prepared using the above described blown film process. An alternative process is the so-called cast film process, wherein the polyethylene is melted in an extruder, then forced through a linear slit die, thereby “casting” a thin flat film. The extrusion temperature for cast film is typically somewhat hotter than that used in the blown film process (with typically operating temperatures of from about 450 to about 550° F.). In general, cast film is cooled (quenched) more rapidly than blown film. In an embodiment of the invention, the films of this invention are prepared using a cast film process. Additives The ethylene copolymer composition used to make films, may also contain additives, such as for example, primary antioxidants (such as hindered phenols, including vitamin E); secondary antioxidants (especially phosphites and phosphonites); nucleating agents, plasticizers or polymer processing aids PPAs (e.g. fluoroelastomer and/or polyethylene glycol bound process aid), acid scavengers, stabilizers, anticorrosion agents, blowing agents, other ultraviolet light absorbers such as chain-breaking antioxidants, etc., quenchers, antistatic agents, slip agents, anti-blocking agent, pigments, dyes and fillers and cure agents such as peroxide. These and other common additives in the polyolefin industry may be present in copolymer compositions from about 0.01 to about 50 wt % in one embodiment, and from about 0.1 to about 20 wt % in another embodiment, and from about 1 to about 5 wt % in yet another embodiment, wherein a desirable range may comprise any combination of any upper wt % limit with any lower wt % limit. In an embodiment of the invention, antioxidants and stabilizers such as organic phosphites and phenolic antioxidants may be present in the copolymer compositions from about 0.001 to about 5 wt % in one embodiment, and from about 0.01 to about 0.8 wt % in another embodiment, and from about 0.02 to about 0.5 wt % in yet another embodiment. Non-limiting examples of organic phosphites that are suitable are tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite (IRGAFOS 168) and tris(nonyl phenyl)phosphite (WESTON 399). Non-limiting examples of phenolic antioxidants include octadecyl 3,5 di-t-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate (IRGANOX 1076) and pentaerythrityl tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) propionate (IRGANOX 1010); and 1,3,5-Tri(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl-isocyanurate (IRGANOX 3114). Fillers may be present in the ethylene copolymer composition from about 0.1 to about 50 wt % in one embodiment, and from about 0.1 to about 25 wt % of the composition in another embodiment, and from about 0.2 to about 10 wt % in yet another embodiment. Fillers include but are not limited to titanium dioxide, silicon carbide, silica (and other oxides of silica, precipitated or not), antimony oxide, lead carbonate, zinc white, lithopone, zircon, corundum, spinel, apatite, Barytes powder, barium sulfate, magnesiter, carbon black, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc and hydrotalcite compounds of the ions Mg, Ca, or Zn with Al, Cr or Fe and CO3 and/or HPO4, hydrated or not; quartz powder, hydrochloric magnesium carbonate, glass fibers, clays, alumina, and other metal oxides and carbonates, metal hydroxides, chrome, phosphorous and brominated flame retardants, antimony trioxide, silica, silicone, and blends thereof. These fillers may include any other fillers and porous fillers and supports which are known in the art. Fatty acid salts may also be present in the copolymer compositions. Such salts may be present from about 0.001 to about 2 wt % of the copolymer composition in one embodiment, and from about 0.01 to about 1 wt % in another embodiment. Examples of fatty acid metal salts include lauric acid, stearic acid, succinic acid, stearyl lactic acid, lactic acid, phthalic acid, benzoic acid, hydroxystearic acid, ricinoleic acid, naphthenic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, and erucic acid, suitable metals including Li, Na, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Cd, Al, Sn, Pb and so forth. Desirable fatty acid salts are selected from magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, sodium stearate, zinc stearate, calcium oleate, zinc oleate, and magnesium oleate. With respect to the physical process of producing the blend of the ethylene copolymer and one or more additives, sufficient mixing should take place to assure that a uniform blend will be produced prior to conversion into a finished product. The copolymer can be in any physical form when used to blend with the one or more additives. In one embodiment, reactor granules, defined as the granules of polymer that are isolated from the polymerization reactor, are used to blend with the additives. The reactor granules have an average diameter of from about 10 μm to about 5 mm, and from about 50 μm to about 10 mm in another embodiment. Alternately, the ethylene copolymer is in the form of pellets, such as, for example, having an average diameter of from about 1 mm to about 6 mm that are formed from melt extrusion of the reactor granules. One method of blending the additives with the ethylene copolymer is to contact the components in a tumbler or other physical blending means, the copolymer being in the form of reactor granules. This can then be followed, if desired, by melt blending in an extruder. Another method of blending the components is to melt blend the copolymer pellets with the additives directly in an extruder, or any other melt blending means. Film Properties. Film (or film layer), is made from the ethylene copolymers defined as above. Generally, an additive as described above is mixed with the ethylene copolymer prior to film production. The ethylene copolymers and films have a balance of processing and mechanical properties. Accordingly, films may be made from an ethylene copolymer having a melt index I2 of below about 1.0 g/10 min, will have a dart impact strength of ≧about 400 g/mil, a about 1% MD secant modulus of greater than about 140 MPa, and a about 1% TD secant modulus of greater than about 170 MPa in combination with good film processing output rates.

The film or film layer may, by way of non-limiting example only, have a total thickness ranging from about 0.5 mils to about 4 mils (note: 1 mil=0.0254 mm), which will depend on for example the die gap employed, during film casting or film blowing. The above description applies to monolayer films. However, the film may also be used in a multilayer film. Multilayer films can be made using a co-extrusion process or a lamination process. In co-extrusion, a plurality of molten polymer streams are fed to an annular die (or flat cast) resulting in a multi-layered film on cooling. In lamination, a plurality of films are bonded together using, for example, adhesives, joining with heat and pressure and the like. A multilayer film structure may, for example, contain tie layers and/or sealant layers. The film of some embodiments the current invention may be a skin layer or a core layer and can be used in at least one or a plurality of layers in a multilayer film. The term “core” or the phrase “core layer”, refers to any internal film layer in a multilayer film. The phrase “skin layer” refers to an outermost layer of a multilayer film (for example, as used in the production of produce packaging). The phrase “sealant layer” refers to a film that is involved in the sealing of the film to itself or to another layer in a multilayer film. A “tie layer” refers to any internal layer that adheres two layers to one another. By way of example only, the thickness of the multilayer films can be from about 0.5 mil to about 10 mil total thickness. The films can be used for heavy duty bags, shrink film, agricultural film, garbage bags and shopping bags. The films can be produced by blow extrusion, cast extrusion, co-extrusion and be incorporated also in laminated structures. The present invention will further be described by reference to the following examples. The following examples are merely illustrative of the invention and are not intended to be limiting. Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLES General All reactions involving air and or moisture sensitive compounds were conducted under nitrogen using standard Schlenk and cannula techniques, or in a glovebox. Reaction solvents were purified either using the system described by Pangborn et. al. in Organometallics 1996, v 15, p. 1518 or used directly after being stored over activated 4 Å molecular sieves. The methylaluminoxane used was a 10% MAO solution in toluene supplied by Albemarle which was used as received. The support used was silica Sylopol 2408 obtained from W.R. Grace. & Co. The support was calcined by fluidizing with air at 200° C. for 2 hours followed by nitrogen at 600° C. for 6 hours and stored under nitrogen. Melt index, I2, in g/10 min was determined on a Tinius Olsen Plastomer (Model MP993) in accordance with ASTM D1238 Procedure A (Manual Operation) at 190° C. with a 2.16 kilogram weight. Melt index, I10, was determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 Procedure A at 190° C. with a 10 kilogram weight. High load melt index, I21, in g/10 min was determined in accordance with ASTM D1238 Procedure A at 190° C. with a 21.6 kilogram weight. Melt flow ratio (also sometimes called melt index ratio) is I21/I2. Polymer density was determined in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc) according to ASTM D792. Molecular weight information (Mw, Mn and Mz in g/mol) and molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn), and z-average molecular weight distribution (MZ/MW) were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), using an instrument sold under the trade name “Waters 150c”, with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the mobile phase at 140° C. The samples were prepared by dissolving the polymer in this solvent and were run without filtration. Molecular weights are expressed as polyethylene equivalents with a relative standard deviation of 2.9% for the number average molecular weight (“Mn”) and 5.0% for the weight average molecular weight (“Mw”). Polymer sample solutions (1 to 2 mg/mL) were prepared by heating the polymer in 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) and rotating on a wheel for 4 hours at 150° C. in an oven. The antioxidant 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) was added to the mixture in order to stabilize the polymer against oxidative degradation. The BHT concentration was 250 ppm. Sample solutions were chromatographed at 140° C. on a PL 220 high-temperature chromatography unit equipped with four Shodex columns (HT803, HT804, HT805 and HT806) using TCB as the mobile phase with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/minute, with a differential refractive index (DRI) as the concentration detector. BHT was added to the mobile phase at a concentration of 250 ppm to protect the columns from oxidative degradation. The sample injection volume was 200 mL. The raw data were processed with Cirrus GPC software. The columns were calibrated with narrow distribution polystyrene standards. The polystyrene molecular weights were converted to polyethylene molecular weights using the Mark-Houwink equation, as described in the ASTM standard test method D6474. The branch frequency of copolymer samples (i.e. the short chain branching, SCB per 1000 carbons) and the C6 comonomer content (in wt %) was determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) as per the ASTM D6645-01 method. A Thermo-Nicolet 750 Magna-IR Spectrophotometer equipped with OMNIC version 7.2a software was used for the measurements. The determination of branch frequency as a function of molecular weight (and hence the comonomer distribution) was carried out using high temperature Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and FT-IR of the eluent. Polyethylene standards with a known branch content, polystyrene and hydrocarbons with a known molecular weight were used for calibration. Hexane extractables using compression molded plaques were determined according to ASTM D5227. To determine the composition distribution breadth index CDBI50 (which is also designated CDBI(50)-CDBI50 and CDBI(50) are used interchangeably herein), a solubility distribution curve is first generated for the copolymer. This is accomplished using data acquired from the TREF technique (see below). This solubility distribution curve is a plot of the weight fraction of the copolymer that is solubilized as a function of temperature. This is converted to a cumulative distribution curve of weight fraction versus comonomer content, from which the CDBI50 is determined by establishing the weight percentage of a copolymer sample that has a comonomer content within 50% of the median comonomer content on each side of the median (see WO 93/03093 for the definition of CDBI50). The weight percentage of copolymer eluting at from 90-105° C., is determined by calculating the area under the TREF curve at an elution temperature of from 90 to 105° C. The weight percent of copolymer eluting below at or 40° C. and above 100° C. was determined similarly. For the purpose of simplifying the correlation of composition with elution temperature, all fractions are assumed to have a Mn≧15,000, where Mn is the number average molecular weight of the fraction. Any low weight fractions present generally represent a trivial portion of the polymer. The remainder of this description and the appended claims maintain this convention of assuming all fractions have Mn≧15,000 in the CDBI50 measurement. The specific temperature rising elution fractionation (TREF) method used herein was as follows. Homogeneous polymer samples (pelletized, 50 to 150 mg) were introduced into the reactor vessel of a crystallization-TREF unit (Polymer ChAR™). The reactor vessel was filled with 20 to 40 mL 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), and heated to the desired dissolution temperature (e.g. 150° C.) for 1 to 3 hours. The solution (0.5 to 1.5 mL) was then loaded into the TREF column filled with stainless steel beads. After equilibration at a given stabilization temperature (e.g. 110° C.) for 30 to 45 minutes, the polymer solution was allowed to crystallize with a temperature drop from the stabilization temperature to 30° C. (0.1 or 0.2° C./minute). After equilibrating at 30° C. for 30 minutes, the crystallized sample was eluted with TCB (0.5 or 0.75 mL/minute) with a temperature ramp from 30° C. to the stabilization temperature (0.25 or 1.0° C./minute). The TREF column was cleaned at the end of the run for 30 minutes at the dissolution temperature. The data were processed using Polymer ChAR software, Excel spreadsheet and TREF software developed in-house. The TREF procedures described above are well known to persons skilled in the art and can be used to determine the modality of a TREF profile, a CDBI50, a copolymer wt % eluting at or below 40° C., a copolymer wt % eluting at above 100° C., a copolymer wt % eluting at from 90° C. to 105° C., a T(75)−T(25) value, as well as the temperatures or temperature ranges where elution intensity maxima (elution peaks) occur. The melting points including a peak melting point (Tm) and the percent crystallinity of the copolymers are determined by using a TA Instrument DSC Q1000 Thermal Analyzer at 10° C./min. In a DSC measurement, a heating-cooling-heating cycle from room temperature to 200° C. or vice versa is applied to the polymers to minimize the thermo-mechanical history associated with them. The melting point and percent of crystallinity are determined by the primary peak temperature and the total area under the DSC curve respectively from the second heating data. The peak melting temperature Tm is the higher temperature peak, when two peaks are present in a bimodal DSC profile (typically also having the greatest peak height). The melt strength of a polymer is measured on Rosand RH-7 capillary rheometer (barrel diameter=15 mm) with a flat die of 2-mm Diameter, L/D ratio 10:1 at 190° C. Pressure Transducer: 10,000 psi (68.95 MPa). Piston Speed: 5.33 mm/min. Haul-off Angle: 52°. Haul-off incremental speed: 50-80 m/min2 or 65±15 m/min2. A polymer melt is extruded through a capillary die under a constant rate and then the polymer strand is drawn at an increasing haul-off speed until it ruptures. The maximum steady value of the force in the plateau region of a force versus time curve is defined as the melt strength for the polymer. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA). Rheological measurements (e.g. small-strain (10%) oscillatory shear measurements) were carried out on a dynamic Rheometrics SR5 Stress rotational rheometer with 25 mm diameter parallel plates in a frequency sweep mode under full nitrogen blanketing. The polymer samples are appropriately stabilized with the anti-oxidant additives and then inserted into the test fixture for at least one minute preheating to ensure the normal force decreasing back to zero. All DMA experiments are conducted at 10% strain, 0.05 to 100 rad/s and 190° C. Orchestrator Software is used to determine the viscoelastic parameters including the storage modulus (G′), loss modulus (G″), phase angle (6), complex modulus (G*) and complex viscosity (η*). The complex viscosity |η*(ω)| versus frequency (ω) data were then curve fitted using the modified three parameter Carreau-Yasuda (CY) empirical model to obtain the zero shear viscosity η0, characteristic viscous relaxation time τη, and the breadth of rheology parameter-a. The simplified Carreau-Yasuda (CY) empirical model used is as follows: [in-line-formulae]|η*(ω)|=η0/[1+(τηω)a](1-n)/a [/in-line-formulae] wherein: |η*(ω)|=magnitude of complex shear viscosity; η0=zero shear viscosity; τη=characteristic relaxation time; a=“breadth” of rheology parameter (which is also called the “Carreau-Yasuda shear exponent” or the “CY a-parameter” or simply the “a-parameter”); n=fixes the final power law slope, fixed at 2/11; and w=angular frequency of oscillatory shearing deformation. Details of the significance and interpretation of the CY model and derived parameters may be found in: C. A. Hieber and H. H. Chiang, Rheol. Acta, 28, 321 (1989); C. A. Hieber and H. H. Chiang, Polym. Eng. Sci., 32, 931 (1992); and R. B. Bird, R. C. Armstrong and O. Hasseger, Dynamics of Polymeric Liquids, Volume 1, Fluid Mechanics, 2nd Edition, John Wiley & Sons (1987); each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The Shear Thinning Index (SHI) was determined according to the method provided in U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2011/0212315: the SHI is defined as SHI(ω)=η*(ω)/η0 for any given frequency (ω) for dynamic viscosity measurement, wherein η0 is zero shear viscosity @190° C. determined via the empiric Cox-Merz-rule. η* is the complex viscosity @190° C. determinable upon dynamic (sinusoidal) shearing or deformation of a copolymer as determined on a Rheometrics SR5 Stress rotational rheometer using parallel-plate geometry. According to the Cox-Merz-Rule, when the frequency (ω) is expressed in Radiant units, at low shear rates, the numerical value of η* is equal to that of conventional, intrinsic viscosity based on low shear capillary measurements. The skilled person in the field of rheology is well versed with determining η0 in this way. The films of the current examples were made on a blown film line manufactured by Battenfeld Gloucester Engineering Company of Gloucester, Mass using a die diameter of 4 inches, and a die gap of 35 or 50 mil (note: a fluoroelastomer type PPA was added to inv. resin 1 for purposes of film production; analysis of competitive resin 2 shows that ca. 250-300 ppm of a fluoroelatomer PPA is present; analysis of competitive resin 3 suggests ca. 600 ppm of carbowax and fluoroelatomer PPA in total is present). This blown film line has a standard output of more than 100 pounds per hour and is equipped with a 50 horsepower motor. Screw speed was 35 to 50 RPM. The extender screw has a 2.5 mil diameter and a length/diameter (L/D) ratio of 24/1. Melt Temperature and Frost Line Height (FLH) are 420 to 430° F. and 16 inches respectively. The blown film bubble is air cooled. Typical blow up ratio (BUR) for blown films prepared on this line are from 1.5/1 to 4/1. An annular die having a gap of 35 mils was used for these experiments. The films of this example were prepared using a BUR aiming point of 2.5:1 and a film thickness aiming point of 1.0 mils. The haze (%) was measured in accordance with the procedures specified in ASTM D 1003-07, using a BYK-Gardner Haze Meter (Model Haze-gard plus). Dart impact strength was measured on a dart impact tester (Model D2085AB/P) made by Kayeness Inc. in accordance with ASTM D-1709-04 (method A). Machine (MD) and transverse (TD) direction Elmendorf tear strengths were measured on a ProTear™ Tear Tester made by Thwing-Albert Instrument Co. in accordance with ASTM D-1922. Puncture resistance was measured on a MTS Systems Universal Tester (Model SMT(HIGH)-500N-192) in accordance with ASTM D-5748. MD or TD secant modulus was measured on an Instrument 5-Head Universal Tester (Model TTC-102) at a crosshead speed of 0.2 in/min up to 10% strain in accordance with ASTM D-882-10. The MD or TD secant modulus was determined by an initial slope of the stress-strain curve from an origin to 1% strain. Film tensile testing was conducted on an Instrument 5-Head Universal Tester (Model TTC-102) in accordance with ASTM D-882-10.

Seal strength or sealability parameter was measured as a function of seal temperature on an Instrument 5-Head Universal Tester (Model TTC-102) in accordance with ASTM F88-09. INVENTIVE EXAMPLES Catalyst System Preparation Synthesis of (1-C6F5CH2—Indenyl)((t-Bu)3P═N)TiCl2 To distilled indene (15.0 g, 129 mmol) in heptane (200 mL) was added BuLi (82 mL, 131 mmol, 1.6 M in hexanes) at room temperature. The resulting reaction mixture was stirred overnight. The mixture was filtered and the filter cake washed with heptane (3×30 mL) to give indenyllithium (15.62 g, 99% yield). Indenyllithium (6.387 g, 52.4 mmol) was added as a solid over 5 minutes to a stirred solution of C6F5CH2—Br (13.65 g, 52.3 mmol) in toluene (100 mL) at room temperature. The reaction mixture was heated to 50° C. and stirred for 4 h. The product mixture was filtered and washed with toluene (3×20 mL). The combined filtrates were evaporated to dryness to afford 1-C6F5CH2-indene (13.58 g, 88%). To a stirred slurry of TiCl4.2THF (1.72 g, 5.15 mmol) in toluene (15 mL) was added solid (t-Bu)3P═N—Li (1.12 g, 5 mmol) at room temperature. The resulting reaction mixture was heated at 100° C. for 30 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature. This mixture containing ((t-Bu)3P═N)TiCl3 (1.85 g, 5 mmol) was used in the next reaction. To a THF solution (10 mL) of 1-C6F5CH2-indene (1.48 g, 5 mmol) cooled at −78° C. was added n-butyllithium (3.28 mL, 5 mmol, 1.6 M in hexanes) over 10 minutes. The resulting dark orange solution was stirred for 20 minutes and then transferred via a double-ended needle to a toluene slurry of ((t-Bu)3P═N)TiCl3 (1.85 g, 5 mmol). The cooling was removed from the reaction mixture which was stirred for a further 30 minutes. The solvents were evaporated to afford a yellow pasty residue. The solid was re-dissolved in toluene (70 mL) at 80° C. and filtered hot. The toluene was evaporated to afford pure (1-C6F5CH2—Indenyl)((t-Bu)3P═N)TiCl2 (2.35 g, 74%). Drying of the Catalyst Modifier. 950 g of commercially available Armostat® 1800 (mp 50° C., by >300° C.), which was used as a catalyst modifier, was loaded in a 2 L-round bottom flask and melted in an oil bath at 80° C. The oil bath temperature was then raised to 110° C. and a high vacuum was applied while maintaining stirring. At first, a lot of bubbles were seen due to the release of gas and moisture vapor. Approximately two hours later, gas evolution subsided and heating/evacuation was continued for another hour. The Armostat 1800 material was then cooled down to room temperature and stored under nitrogen atmosphere until use. To determine the level of moisture in the Armostat 1800, a 15 wt % of an Armostat solution in pre-dried toluene was prepared and the moisture of the solution was determined by Karl-Fischer titration method. The moisture levels in Armostat 1800 as received from the commercial supplier, as well as that dried by traditional methods (i.e. drying the solution over molecular sieves) and by use of low pressure water distillation was determined. The unpurified catalyst modifier was found to make a 15 wt % toluene solution having 138 ppm of H2O. The catalyst modifier which was dried over molecular sieves was found to make a 15 wt % toluene solution having 15-20 ppm of H2O. The catalyst modifier which was dried by vacuum distillation of water was found to make a 15 wt % toluene solution having 14-16 ppm of H2O. It has thus been shown, that simple vacuum distillation to remove water is as effective as drying methods which employ molecular sieves. In fact, the vacuum distillation has an advantage over use of molecular sieves as a drying agent in that it is far less time consuming (molecular sieves took over 2 days to dry the catalyst modifier sufficiently and multiple batches of the sieves were used), and more cost effective (the use of sieves led to a decrease in the concentration of the catalyst modifier in toluene solution due to catalyst modifier absorption into the sieves, and used large quantities of solvent to sufficiently solubilize the catalyst modifier in order to make efficient contact with the sieves). Preparation of Supported Catalyst. Sylopol 2408 silica purchased from Grace Davison was calcined by fluidizing with air at 200° C. for 2 hours and subsequently with nitrogen at 600° C. for 6 hours. 114.273 grams of the calcined silica was added to 620 mL of toluene. 312.993 g of a MAO solution containing 4.5 weight % Al purchased from Albemarle was added to the silica slurry quantitatively. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours at ambient temperature. The stirring rate should be such so as not to break-up the silica particles. 2.742 grams of (1-C6F5CH2—Indenyl)((t-Bu)3P═N)TiCl2 (prepared as above in Example 1) was weighed into a 500-mL Pyrex bottle and 300 mL of toluene added. The metal complex solution was added to the silica slurry quantitatively. The resulting slurry was stirred for 2 hours at ambient temperature. 21.958 g of 18.55 wt % toluene solution of Armostat® 1800 was weighed into a small vessel and transferred quantitatively to the silica slurry. The resulting mixture was stirred for a further 30 minutes after which the slurry was filtered, yielding a clear filtrate. The solid component was washed with toluene (2×150 mL) and then with pentane (2×150 mL). The final product was dried in vacuo to between 450 and 200 mtorr and stored under nitrogen until used. The finished catalyst had a pale yellow to pale orange colour. The catalyst had 2.7 wt % of Armostat present. Polymerization—TSR Continuous ethylene/1-hexene gas phase copolymerization experiments were conducted in a 56.4 L Technical Scale Reactor (TSR) in continuous gas phase operation (for an example of a TSR reactor set up see Eur. Pat. Appl. No. 659,773A1). Ethylene polymerizations were run at 75° C.-90° C. with a total operating pressure of 300 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). Gas phase compositions for ethylene and 1-hexene were controlled via closed-loop process control to values of 65.0 and 0.5-2.0 mole %, respectively. Hydrogen was metered into the reactor in a molar feed ratio of 0.0008-0.0020 relative to ethylene feed during polymerization. Nitrogen constituted the remainder of the gas phase mixture (approximately 34-64 mole %). A typical production rate for these conditions is 2.0 to 3.0 kg of polyethylene per hour. A seed-bed was used and prior to polymerization start-up was washed with a small amount of triethylaluminum, TEAL to scavenge impurities. Prior to introduction of the catalyst TEAL was flushed from the reactor. The catalyst was fed to the reactor together with small amount of dilute TEAL solution (0.25 wt %) during the start-up phase. The addition of TEAL was discontinued once the desired polymer production rate was reached. Alternatively, the reactor can be started with the catalyst feed line alone during the polymerization start-up phase (that is, without initially feeding the TEAL solution). The polymerization reaction was initiated under conditions of low comonomer concentration, followed by gradual adjustment of the comonomer to ethylene ratio to provide the targeted polymer density. Pelletization of Granular Resins. 500 ppm of Irganox 1076 and 1000 ppm of Irgafos 168 were dry blended with the granular resin prior to pelletization. The resulting powder blend was extruded on Leistritz twin-screw extruder with a screw diameter of 38 mm and L/D ratio of 33/1 under nitrogen atmosphere to minimize polymer degradation. The pelletization conditions of the extruder were set at a melt temperature of 210° C. an output rate of 20 to 25 lb/hr, a screw speed of 120 rpm and a pelletizer speed of 30 to 40 rpm. The pelleted resin was cooled and then collected for the resin characterization and film evaluation. Catalyst composition information and steady state polymerization conditions are provided in Table 1 (C2=ethylene; C6=1-hexene; H2=hydrogen; and C6/C2 for example is the molar feed ratio of each component to the reactor). Polymer data for the resulting inventive resins are provided in Table 2. Film data for inventive films made from the inventive resins are provided in Table 3. Polymerization—Pilot Plant Ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization experiments were conducted in a continuous fluidized bed gas phase Pilot Plant scale reactor. An example of a reactor configuration and typical process operational parameters is given in for example U.S. Pat. No. 8,338,551 B2 and in Eur. Pat. Appl. No. 1,308,464 A1 (see Examples 10 and 11). Ethylene polymerizations were run at 80° C.-85° C. with a total operating pressure of 300 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). Gas phase compositions for ethylene and 1-hexene were controlled via closed-loop process control to values of 35-50.0 and 0.5-2.0 mole %, respectively. Hydrogen was metered into the reactor in a molar feed ratio of 0.0008-0.0015 relative to ethylene feed during polymerization. Nitrogen constituted the remainder of the gas phase mixture (approximately 34-49 mole %). A typical production rate for these conditions is 100 to 250 kg of polyethylene per hour. A seed-bed was used and prior to polymerization start-up was washed with a small amount of triethylaluminum, TEAL to scavenge impurities. The gas composition of ethylene, 1-hexene, hydrogen, nitrogen and pentane/isopentane in the reactor is built to target amounts before injection of catalyst. The level of pentane/isopentane can range from 9-17 mole % in the reactor. The reactor was started with the catalyst feed line alone without additional scavenging with TEAL during the polymerization start-up. The polymerization reaction was initiated under conditions of lower comonomer concentration and higher hydrogen concentration, followed by gradual adjustment of the comonomer to ethylene ratio and hydrogen to ethylene ratio to achieve targeted polymer density and melt index. Pelletization of the granular resin was carried out as per TSR scale (see above). Catalyst composition information and steady state polymerization conditions are provided in Table 1 (C2=ethylene; C6=1-hexene; H2=hydrogen; and C6/C2 for example is the molar feed ratio of each component to the reactor). Polymer data for the resulting inventive resins are provided in Table 2. Film data for inventive films made from the inventive resins are provided in Table 3.

No. 7,531,602 (see Example 2). Preparation of the Supported Catalyst. To a slurry of dehydrated silica (122.42 g) in toluene (490 mL) was added a 10 wt % MAO solution (233.84 g of 4.5 wt Al in toluene) over 10 minutes. The vessel containing the MAO was rinsed with toluene (2×10 mL) and added to the reaction mixture. The resultant slurry was stirred with an overhead stirrer assembly (200 rpm) for 1 hour at ambient temperature. To this slurry was added a toluene (46 mL) solution of (1,2-(n-propyl)(C6F5)Cp)Ti(N═P(t-Bu)3)Cl2 (2.28 g) over 10 minutes. This solution may need to be gently heated to 45° C. for a brief period (5 minutes) to fully dissolve the molecule. The vessel containing the molecule was rinsed with toluene (2×10 mL) and added to the reaction mixture. After stirring for 2 hours (200 rpm) at ambient temperature a toluene (22 mL) solution of Armostat-1800 (which was previously dried according to the method above for “Drying a Catalyst Modifier”) at 8.55 wt % was added to the slurry which was further stirred for 30 minutes. The slurry was filtered and rinsed with toluene (2×100 mL) and then with pentane (2×100 mL). The catalyst was dried in vacuo to less than 1.5 wt % residual volatiles. The solid catalyst was isolated and stored under nitrogen until further use. The catalyst had 2.7 wt % of Armostat present. Polymerization Continuous ethylene/1-hexene gas phase copolymerization experiments were conducted in a 56.4 L Technical Scale Reactor (TSR) in continuous gas phase operation. Ethylene polymerizations were run at 75° C.-90° C. with a total operating pressure of 300 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). Gas phase compositions for ethylene and 1-hexene were controlled via closed-loop process control to values of 65.0 and 0.5-2.0 mole %, respectively. Hydrogen was metered into the reactor in a molar feed ratio of 0.0008-0.0015 relative to ethylene feed during polymerization. Nitrogen constituted the remainder of the gas phase mixture (approximately 38 mole %). A typical production rate for these conditions is 2.0 to 3.0 kg of polyethylene per hour. Pelletization of Granular Resins. 500 ppm of Irganox 1076 and 1000 ppm of Irgafos 168 were dry blended with the granular resin prior to pelletization. The resulting powder blend was extruded on Leistritz twin-screw extruder with a screw diameter of 38 mm and L/D ratio of 33/1 under nitrogen atmosphere to minimize polymer degradation. The pelletization conditions of the extruder were set at a melt temperature of 210° C. an output rate of 20 to 25 lb/hr, a screw speed of 120 rpm and a pelletizer speed of 30 to 40 rpm. The pelleted resin was cooled and then collected for the resin characterization and film evaluation. Steady state polymerization conditions are provided in Table 4 (C2=ethylene; C6=1-hexene; C6/C2 is the molar feed ratio of each component to the reactor). Polymer data for the resulting comparative resin 1 is provided in Table 5. Film data for films made from the comparative resin 1 is provided in Table 6.

The inventive resins (see inv. 1-6) have a MFR (i.e. I21/I2) of greater than 30, while the comparative resins 1 and 2 each have a melt flow ratio of less than 30. Further, the copolymer compositions having a fractional melt index (inv. 1-5) have a similar MFR as an Enable 20-05™ resin having a fractional melt index (comp. 3), but a very different TREF profile. Similarly, a copolymer composition having a melt index of about 1.2 (inv. 6) has a similar MFR as an Enable 20-10™ resin having a melt index of about 1.1 (comp. 4), but a very different TREF profile. The TREF profile of the inventive resins is multimodal (bimodal or trimodal with two or three prominent peaks separated by 5° C. or more), while the comp. resins 3 and 4 each have a single peak evident in the TREF analysis. The inventive resins 1-6 have a composition distribution breadth index CDBI50 of less than 75 wt % while comp. resins 3 and 4 each have a CDBI50 of greater than 85%. Comparison of the inventive resins 1-6, with ELITE resins (comparative examples 6 and 7) shows that although each may have a multimodal TREF profile (note: that the Elite resin is a copolymer of ethylene and 1-octene, and the inventive resin is a copolymer of ethylene and 1-hexene), the inventive resins 1-6 have a broader molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn of greater than 4.0) and a higher MFR (I21/I2 is greater than 32). The comparative resin 8, which is DOWLEX 2045G, and is made using a Ziegler-Natta catalyst, has a bimodal TREF profile and a MFR of less than 30. When blown into film, inv. resins 1-5 have good dart impact values, good stiffness, and are easy to process as indicated by the low shear thinning index (SHI) and the high specific output rates. As shown in Tables 3 and 6, the dart impact of the fractional melt index resins, inv. resins 1, 3-5 is typically more than 500 g/mil and are almost as good as comp. resin 2, which has a much lower melt flow ratio (I21/I2). An exception is inv. resin 2 which has a dart impact of 438 g/mil. The inv. resins 1, 3-5 also have a higher dart impact value than comparative resins of similar melt index and/or melt flow ratio: compare for example, comp. resin 3 (an Enable type resin) and comp. resin 5 (a melt blend of LLDPE and HPLDPE) which have dart impact values of 473 g/mil and 317 g/mil respectively with inventive resins 1, 3, 4 and 5, which have a dart impact value of 638 g/mil, 887 g/mil, 542 g/mil and 684 g/mil respectively. Inventive resin 6 (which has a melt index I2 of about 1.2 g/10 min), has a somewhat lower dart impact at 225 g/mil than that of comp. resin 4 at 286 g/mil (which has a similar melt index I2), but this may be due to the fact that it also has a higher density. The stiffness of the inv. resins 1-5, as indicated by the 1% TD and MD secant modulus is similar or higher relative to comparative resins 2, 3 or 5. As shown in Tables 3 and 6, the inventive resins 1, 3-5 have a 1% MD secant modulus of greater than 190 MPa when blown into a ˜1 mil film. Comparative resins 2, 3 and 5 have a 1% MD secant modulus of 137, 187, and 167 MPa respectively when blown into a ˜1 mil film. Inv. resins 1-5 have a 1% TD secant modulus of greater than 210 MPa when blown into a ˜1 mil film. Comparative resins 2, 3 and 5 have a 1% TD secant modulus of 166, 208 and 208 MPa respectively when blown into a ˜1 mil film. A similar comparison between inv. resin 6 (which has a melt index I2 of about 1.2 g/10 min) with comp. resin 4 (which has a melt index I2 of 1.1 g/10 min), shows that inv. resin 6 has higher 1% TD and MD secant modulus. Inv. resin 6 has a 1% MD secant modulus of 230 MPa and a 1% TD secant modulus of 255 MPa, while comp. resin 4 has a 1% MD secant modulus of 156 MPa and a 1% TD secant modulus of 171 MPa. In terms of processability, the inventive resins 1-5 extrude with a higher specific output rate at lower head pressure than comparative resin 2 which has a lower melt flow ratio (see Tables 3 and 6). Inventive resins 1-5 have a similar specific output rate relative to comp. resin 3, but generally at lower extruder head pressure (with inv. resin 3 being an exception). Comp. resin 5 is a melt blend comprising a linear low density resin LLDPE and 5 wt % of high pressure low density polyethylene (HPLDPE) resin which is known to impart improved processability to a LLDPE due to the presence of long chain branching. Nevertheless, inventive resins 1-5 show higher specific output even at lower extruder head pressure than comparative resin 5 (see Tables 3 and 6). As can be seen in Table 2, the inventive resins having a fractional melt index I2, inventive resins 1-5 have a reverse comonomer distribution, a multimodal TREF profile, a CDBI50 within a range of from 45 to 75 wt %, an MFR within a range of 32 to 50, a Mw/Mn within a range of from 3.5 to 6.0 and a melt index I2 of less than 1.0 g/10 min. Also shown in Table 2, inventive resin 6 has a reverse comonomer distribution, a multimodal TREF profile, a CDBI50 within a range of from 45 to 75 wt %, an MFR within a range of 32 to 50, a Mw/Mn within a range of from 3.5 to 6.0 and a melt index I2 of about 1.2 g/10 min. Each of the inventive resins 1-6 shown in Table 2 also have a broad unimodal molecular weight distribution (see FIG. 2 as representative of the inventive ethylene copolymers). Representative TREF curves are shown in FIG. 1A for inventive resin 1 and in FIG. 1B for inventive resin 3. A representative GPC curve is shown for Inventive resin 1 in FIG. 2. A representative GPC-FTIR curve is shown for inventive resin 1 in FIG. 3. A van Gurp-Palmen analysis is a means by which to study a polymer architecture (e.g. molecular weight distribution, linearity, etc.) as reflected by the polymer melt morphology. A VGP curve is simply a plot of the phase angle (δ) versus complex modulus (G*), where the two rheology parameters are obtained using the frequency sweep test in dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). A shift of a VGP curve from a baseline curve or a decrease in the phase angles at the mid-range of complex modulus may indicate changes in the polymer melt morphology. A VGP plot allows for a determination of the crossover rheology parameter which is defined as the intersecting point obtained between the phase angle (δ) vs. complex modulus (G*) plot and a phase angle (δ) vs. complex viscosity (if) plot. Based on a linear viscoelasticity theory, the VGP crossover rheology parameter or “crossover phase angle” (δXO) occurs at a frequency (ω) which is equal to unity. It is the phase angle at which the G* and the η* are equivalent. Hence the VGP crossover rheology parameter can be determined in a single DMA test. The VGP crossover plots for resins sold under the trade-names Exceed 1018CA (Comp. 2) and Enable (Comp. 3) are included in FIGS. 4A and 4B respectively. The VGP crossover plots for the inventive resin 1 is shown in FIG. 4B. The VGP crossover plots for comparative resin 1, made according to comparative example 1, are included in FIG. 4A. Finally, the resin sold under the trade name Elite 5400G (Comp. 7) is included in FIG. 4B. The VGP crossover points are dependent upon the copolymer architecture. Generally, for resins which are easier to process such as inventive copolymer 1 and comparative resin 3, the VGP phase angle at which crossover occurs defined as δXO is lower than for resins which are more difficult to process such as comparative copolymers 1 and 2 (compare FIGS. 4A and 4B). For resins that are easier to process, the shape of the phase angle-complex viscosity curves and the shape of the phase-angle complex modulus curves, are deflected somewhat and more closely resemble mirror images of each other, relative to the curves obtained for resins which are more difficult to process (compare the curves in FIG. 4A with the curves in FIG. 4B). As shown in Table 2, all the inventive ethylene copolymers 1-6 also satisfy one or more of the following relationships: [in-line-formulae](Mw/Mn)≧72[(I21/I2)−1+10−6(Mn)];[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]δXO of from 55° to 70°;[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]δXO≦83.0−1.25(CDBI50)/(Mw/Mn); and[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]δXO≦80.7−(CDBI50)/(Mw/Mn) at a δXO of from 55° to 70°;[/in-line-formulae] where δXO is the crossover phase angle, Mw, Mn, I21, I2 and CDBI50 are all as defined as above. The data provided in Table 5, shows that none of the comparative resins 1-8 satisfy the condition: i) (Mw/Mn)≧72 [(I21/I2)−1+10−6 (Mn)] and that none of the comparative resins 1-4, and 6-8 satisfy either of the conditions: ii) δXO≦83.0−1.25 (CDBI50)/(Mw/Mn), or iii) δXO≦80.7−(CDBI50)/(MW/Mn) at a δXO of from 55° to 70°. For further comparison purposes, inventive ethylene copolymers 1-6 have been plotted against several known commercial resins in FIG. 5. FIG. 5 shows a plot of the equation: (Mw/Mn)=72 [(I21/I2)−1+10−6 (Mn)], as well as a plot of the Mw/M, vs. 72 [(I21/I2)1+10−6 (Mn)] values for inv. resins 1-6 as well as several known commercial resins. The commercial resins included in FIG. 5 for comparison purposes are all resins having an melt index I2 of 1.5 g/10 min or less and a density of between 0.916 and 0.930 g/cm3 and which are sold under trade names such as, Elite™, Exceed™, Marflex™, Starflex™ Dowlex™, SURPASS™, SCLAIR™, NOVAPOL™ and Enable™. As can be seen from FIG. 5, none of these commercial grades satisfy the condition: (Mw/Mn)≧72 [(I21/I2)−1+10−6 (Mn)]. In contrast all of the inv. resins 1-6 satisfy the condition: (Mw/Mn)≧72 [(I21/I2)−1+10−6 (Mn)]. This work demonstrates the distinct architecture of the inventive ethylene copolymers. For further comparison purposes, inventive ethylene copolymers 1-6 have been plotted against several known commercial resins in FIG. 6. FIG. 6 shows a plot of the equation: δXO=83.0−1.25 (CDBI50)/(Mw/Mn), as well as a plot of the δXO vs. 83.0−1.25 (CDBI50)/(Mw/Mn) values for inv. resins 1-6 and several known commercial resins. The commercial resins included in FIG. 6 for comparison purposes are all resins having a melt index I2 of 1.5 g/10 min or less and a density of between 0.916 and 0.930 g/cm3 and which are sold under trade names such as, Elite™, Exceed™, Marflex™, Starflex™ Dowlex™, SURPASS™, SCLAIR™, NOVAPOL™ and Enable™. As can be seen from the figure, none of these commercial grades satisfy the condition: δXO<83.0−1.25 (CDBI50) (Mw/Mn). In contrast, most of the inv. resins 1-6 satisfy the condition: δXO≦83.0−1.25 (CDBI50)/(Mw/Mn). This work further demonstrates the distinct architecture of the inventive ethylene copolymers. For further comparison purposes, inventive ethylene copolymers 1-6 have been plotted against several known commercial resins in FIG. 7. FIG. 7 shows a plot of the equation: δXO=80.7−(CDBI50)/(Mw/Mn), as well as a plot of the δXO vs. 80.7−(CDBI50)/(Mw/Mn) values for inv. resins 1-6 and several known commercial resins. FIG. 7 also shows which of the inventive and commercial resins have a δXO of from 55° to 70°. The commercial resins included in FIG. 7 for comparison purposes are all resins having an melt index I2 of 1.5 g/10 min or less and a density of between 0.916 and 0.930 g/cm3 and which are sold under trade names such as, Elite™, Exceed™, Marflex™, Starflex™ Dowlex™, SURPASS™, SCLAIR™, NOVAPOL™ and Enable™. As can be seen from FIG. 7, none of these commercial grades satisfy the condition where δXO≦80.7−(CDBI50)/(Mw/Mn) at a δXO of from 55° to 70°. In contrast all of the inv. resins 1-6 satisfy the condition where δXO≦80.7−(CDBI50)/(Mw/Mn) at a δXO of from 55° to 70°. This work demonstrates the distinct architecture of the inventive ethylene copolymers. The present invention has been described with reference to certain details of particular embodiments thereof.
