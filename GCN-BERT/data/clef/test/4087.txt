(10) Preparation of (2S,5R)-2-((2-azaspiro[3.5]nonane-7-yl)carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate · trifluoroacetate
Tetra(n-butyl)ammonium (2S,5R)-2-((2-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-2-azaspiro[3.5]nonane-7-yl) carbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl sulfate (400 mg, 0.55 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL), at 0°C trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL) was added dropwise. The system was reacted at 0°C for 1 h, and ethyl ether (30 mL) was added, filtrated to obtain a solid. The solid was purified by high performance liquid chromatography to obtain the title compound as a yellow solid (12 mg, yield 6%).
