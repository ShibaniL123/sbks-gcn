Example 4A
2-tert-Butyl 4-ethyl 5-{[(2,4-dimethoxybenzyl)carbamoyl]amino}-3-methylthiophene-2,4-dicarboxylate
8.78 g (30.8 mmol) of 2-tert-butyl 4-ethyl 5-amino-3-methylthiophene-2,4-dicarboxylate (Example 1A) were dissolved in 300 ml of dichloromethane and 9.98 g (61.5 mmol) of CDI and 17.2 ml (123 mmol) of triethylamine were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 2 days, after which 9.3 ml (61.5 mmol) of 2,4-dimethoxybenzylamine were added. After stirring at RT for a further 2 h, the mixture was diluted with 200 ml of dichloromethane and washed successively with in each case about 200 ml of water and saturated sodium chloride solution. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, the mixture was filtered and the filtrate was evaporated. The remaining residue was taken up in dichloromethane, insolubles being removed by filtration. The filtrate was applied to silica gel and chromatographed on silica gel using cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 2:1â†’1:1 as eluent. After combination of the product fractions, evaporation and drying of the residue under high vacuum, 12.8 g (87% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
