2-chloro-5-(2-piperidinoethoxy)aniline (500 mg, 1.9 mmol, 1 eq.) was placed in mixture of acetone (653 µL) and water (852 µL) in the presence of K2CO3 (541 m g, 3.9 mmol, 2 eq.). Cinnamoyl chloride (326 mg, 1.9 mmol, 1 eq.) was then added at 0°C. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm-up to room temperature, stirred for 2 hours and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to afford N-(2-chloro-5-(2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethoxy)phenyl)cinnamamide (521 mg, 69%).
