Step 4: (E)-3-((2,6-Dichlorophenyl)amino)-1-(2,4,5-trichloropyridin-3-yl)but-2-en-1-one
To a solution of 1-(2,4,5-trichloropyridin-3-yl)but-2-yn-1-one (2.36 g, 9.50 mmol) and 2,6-dichloroaniline (1.69 g, 10.45 mmol) in 50 ml of DCM was added AlCl3 (1.52 g, 11.40 mmol) at 0Â° C. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. 2N NaOH solution was added to the reaction mixture and it was extracted with DCM three times. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude was purified with silica-gel chromatography (10-100% EtOAc in heptane) to give the title compound (2.99 g, 77%).
