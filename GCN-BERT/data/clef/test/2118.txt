PALATABILITY ENHANCING COMPOSITIONS Field of the Invention The invention relates generally to palatability enhancing compositions and particularly to palatability enhancing compositions containing two or more palatability enhancing ingredients. Background of the Invention Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field. There are various ways of enhancing the palatability of comestible compositions. Addition of one or more ingredients that provide an appealing aroma or flavor can increase palatability. Ingredients that affect food qualities such as aroma, flavor, texture, or mouthfeel, can also affect palatability. It is known that, for some compositions, increasing sweetness or increasing fat or salt content can enhance palatability for some animals. Flavor enhancers, such as glutamic acid or its salts and various nucleotide or ribonucleotide compounds are known in the art to be palatability enhancers. There are many known specific methods and compositions useful for enhancing palatability. For example, US20080085350A1 discloses a method for producing a palatability enhancer for a companion animal food product, wherein the method includes combining at least one aroma chemical selected from 2-methylfuran, 2-methylpyrrole, 2-methyl-thiophene and dimethyl disulfide with an animal or vegetarian digest composition. US20050276881A1 discloses a catnip palatability enhancer comprising nepetalactone in form of catnip, catnip oil, matatabi, extract of matatabi, nepetalactone, and/or active analog of nepetalactone. Tetrasodium pyrophosphate (№4Ρ2Ο7) is a common food additive. Tetrasodium pyrophosphate is found in foods such as tuna and chicken nuggets and in food analogs such as imitation crab meat. Tetrasodium pyrophosphate is also a palatability enhancer used in various foods such as pet foods. US6254920, US6350485, US7244460 and US7186437 disclose the use of tetrasodium pyrophosphate as a palatability enhancer or component thereof. Tetrasodium pyrophosphate is available commercially; methods for producing tetrasodium pyrophosphate are known to skilled artisans, e.g., US4873068, US4873068, and US4997634. It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative. The invention relates generally to new methods and compositions that make foods and other comestible compositions more palatable. The invention relates generally to palatability enhancing compositions. The invention relates generally to comestible compositions having enhanced palatability. The invention relates generally to methods for hydrating animals. The invention relates generally to using palatability enhancing compositions comprising a palatability enhancing amount of two or more of tetrasodium pyrophosphate, one or more animal by-products, and one or more microbial proteins. The palatability enhancing compositions are combined with one or more comestible ingredients to produce comestible compositions having enhanced palatability. In a preferred embodiment, water is combined with palatability enhancing amounts of tetrasodium pyrophosphate, one or more animal by-products, and one or more microbial proteins to produce a highly palatable water beverage that increases consumption and therefore hydration when offered to an animal. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words “comprise”, “comprising”, and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of “including, but not limited to”. Although the invention will be described with reference to specific examples it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be embodied in many other forms.
