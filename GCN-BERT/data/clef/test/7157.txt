No. 14/230,097, filed Mar. 31, 2014), which is a continuation of U.S. Pat. No. 8,731,696, issued May 20, 2014 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/616,762, filed Sep. 14, 2012), which is a divisional application of U.S. Pat. No. 8,295,962, issued Oct. 23, 2012 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/053,445, filed Mar. 22, 2011), which is a divisional application of U.S. Pat. No. 7,945,343, issued May 17, 2011 (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/612,320, filed Dec. 18, 2006), all of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. BACKGROUND 1. Field The present invention relates generally to articles of footwear and in particular to a method of making an article of footwear. 2. Description of Related Art Customization systems for some types of apparel have been previously proposed. Usually, designs may be applied to t-shirts. In some cases, apparel such as jeans may be modified and custom designed. Sometimes, the system through which the customer designs and orders the apparel may be the Internet. Sullivan (U.S. patent number 2005/0289018) discloses an online personal apparel design and sales technology with associated technology and fulfillment techniques and processes. Sullivan teaches methods for customized and personalized design of apparel. The most common type of apparel taught by Sullivan includes various types of shirts and t-shirts. Generally, Sullivan teaches a system for customization, but does not disclose detailed processes by which the customized apparel is produced. Costin (U.S. patent number 2005/0131571) teaches an Internet customization of apparel. Specifically, Costin teaches an Internet based technique of allowing customization of denim apparel over the Internet. Costin uses a laser device that etches designs and patterns into denim apparel. Generally, techniques of applying intricate images and graphics involving multiple colors are not disclosed. Allen et al. (U.S. patent number 2005/0071242) discloses a method and system for custom-manufacturing footwear. This system and method may allow a retailer to control the selection of choices given to the customer for custom-manufacturing the footwear. Generally, however, the method of Allen lacks provisions for allowing for a full range of graphical designs and modifications to customize an article of footwear. In the method of Allen, the designs of the article of footwear are pre-determined by the manufacturer, allowing the user the option of selecting between designs and in some cases, various colors for the designs. There is no feature, for example, allowing a user to add a customized image of their choosing to an article of footwear. Articles of footwear that may be designed by printing along a two-dimensional portion of an article of footwear have also been proposed. Davis et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,299,962) teaches an invention directed to an article of footwear and a method of making the same, where the article of footwear has a minimum number of upper pieces. In the method of Davis, the outer layer of the upper is molded using an embossing tool. Additionally, the outer layer may be decorated by screen printing, sublimation, large format ink jet printing, cold and hot peel transfers, as well as other means. Generally, however, the method of Davis is limited to printing only a single portion of an upper. While the related art teaches various methods for customizing apparel, there are many shortcomings. Generally, the automated methods used for producing customized apparel based on customized designs lack provisions for applying customized designs to objects with curved surfaces. Specifically, the methods used for producing customized t-shirts, which are themselves flat and two-dimensional, are not appropriate for articles of footwear that include many curved surfaces. Additionally, the article of footwear disclosed in the prior art lacks customization and variability in the footwear portions that may be modified using a printer or other similar devices. There is therefore a need in the art for a customization system directed at articles of footwear including steps for customizing the article of footwear as well as steps for manufacturing the customized article of footwear.

In this embodiment, second image 606 may be selected and tiled along footwear representation 402, using tiling tool 603. Although, in this embodiment, second image 606 is a simple shape, in other embodiments any image, photo, or word may be tiled using tiling tool 603. In still other embodiments, numbers and/or various logos may be added to footwear representation 402 along any portion. These numbers and/or logos may also be tiled. Generally, a customization system for an article of footwear may include provisions for applying words or letters to an article of footwear. In some embodiments, a graphical interface system may include a provision for applying letters to a footwear representation. In a preferred embodiment, the graphical interface system may include a text tool. Referring to FIG. 7, toolbox 420 preferably includes text tool 424, as previously discussed. In some embodiments, text tool 424 may be applied to any portion of footwear representation 402. In a preferred embodiment, text tool 424 includes a variety of fonts as well as font sizes and colors. In other words, a customer may add letters or words to footwear representation using the default font and default font size. Following this, the customer may modify the font type, font size and/or font color using font menu 702. In this embodiment, footwear representation 402 includes first text 704. In some embodiments, first text 704 may be disposed along customer selected portion 705 of medial side 706. In a preferred embodiment, first text 704 may be a name. Generally, first text 704 may be any group of letters that may be fit along medial side 706 of footwear representation 402. In many cases, the customer may prefer a particular background color or a set of colors for footwear representation 402. As the design will eventually be printed onto a sheet material that may not have the desired background color, graphical interface system 400 preferably includes provisions for allowing the customer (or the manufacturer) to implement a specific background color, or set of background colors (including a background image) to footwear representation 402. By printing a background color, substantially all of an article of footwear can be colored using a digital printing process. Preferably, a graphical interface system may include provisions for easily applying simple patterns to a footwear representation. Since the footwear representation is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object, the application of stripes and other design patterns to the footwear representation should reflect the curved nature of the article of footwear. In this case it may be preferable that the graphical interface system include tools for easily applying various patterns to the curved surfaces of the footwear representation. Referring to FIGS. 8-10, graphical interface system 400 may include freehand line tool 802 and single stripe tool 840. In some embodiments, selecting free hand line tool 802 may allow the user to draw free hand line 808 along footwear representation 402. In particular, free hand line tool 802 is preferably configured to apply a user drawn wavy line along customer designated portion 807 of footwear representation 402. Generally, custom selected portion 807 may be associated with any portion of footwear representation 402. In some cases, single stripe tool 840 may be selected, resulting in the application of stripe 804 to footwear representation 402. Preferably, stripe 804 is disposed over throat region 806 of footwear representation 402. Using directional tool 404 to rotate footwear representation 402, vamp region 902 of footwear representation 402 may be seen to include stripe 804. In other words, stripe 804 continues from outsole 830 of medial side 706 to vamp region 902. In a similar manner, stripe 804 also preferably extends to a lateral side of footwear representation 402. In some embodiments, stripes may be applied in a direction perpendicular to stripe 804. In other words, stripes that are oriented along the length of footwear representation 402 may be applied. In a preferred embodiment, third stripe 1002 may be applied to footwear representation 402 using single stripe tool 840. In this embodiment, third stripe 1002 preferably runs from front region 1006 to rear region 1008 of footwear representation 402. With free hand line tool 802 and single stripe tool 840 the customer need not account for the three dimensionality of the surface of the final article of footwear in applying stripes, lines or images to footwear representation 402. Instead, graphical interface system 400 applies the stripes, lines, or images in a manner that matches the structural design of the final article of footwear. Additionally, the thicknesses of shapes created using free hand line tool 802 and single stripe tool 840 may be varied. In some embodiments, the colors of stripes created using free hand line tool 802 and single stripe tool 840 may also be varied. In a preferred embodiment, each of the tools 802 and 840 may include customizable options including a thickness level and a color selector. The tools intended for graphic design and editing mentioned here are not meant to be exhaustive, but only illustrative of the various types of graphical and editing tools that may be applied to footwear representation 402 in order to allow a customer to personally customize an article of footwear to their exact specifications. Examples of other graphical and/or editing tools that may be included in toolbox 420 or within graphical interface system 400 in general, include but are not limited to, selection tools, direct selection tools, magic wand tools, pen tools, line segment tools, paintbrush tools, pencil tools, gradient tools, paint bucket tools, cropping tools, as well as other kinds of tools. Generally, each of the tools mentioned previously may be applied simultaneously in order to customize an article of footwear. In some embodiments, text may be combined with stripes and/or lines. In other embodiments, lines may be combined with custom designated images. In some embodiments, stripes, text, and custom designated images may be applied to the same footwear representation. FIG. 11 is a preferred embodiment of graphical interface system 400 including customized footwear representation 1100. In this embodiment, customized footwear representation 1100 is oriented so that medial side 1102 is visible. In some embodiments, customized footwear representation 1100 may include first lightning bolt 1106 disposed along front region 1108. Additionally, customized footwear representation 1100 may include first photo 1110 and large stripe 1112, disposed along medial side 1102. Additionally, first portion 1113 of text 1114 may be disposed along rear region 1116. Finally, small stripes 1120 are preferably disposed along cuff region 1122. Using directional tool 420, lateral side 1202 of customized footwear representation 1100 may be displayed within graphical interface system 400, as seen in FIG. 12. In a similar manner to medial side 1102, lateral side 1202 preferably includes second lightning bolt 1204 disposed along front region 1108. Lateral side 1202 also preferably includes second photo 1206. Preferably, rear region 1116 may include second portion 1208 of text 1114. Finally, lateral side 1202 also preferably includes large stripe 1112 and small stripes 1120. Once a customer has finished customizing a design for an article of footwear, they may be provided with an option of duplicating the design for a second, complementary, article of footwear. In some embodiments, this option may be provided through the graphical interface system. In a preferred embodiment, the graphical interface system may include a button configured to duplicate a design and apply it to a second, complementary, article of footwear. In some embodiments, the customer may decline this duplication option and proceed to independently design a second, complementary, article of footwear. Preferably, once the customer has completed the designs for a pair of articles of footwear, these designs may be finalized and submitted to the factory, as previously discussed. Once the designs have been received by the factory, the article of footwear may be produced by a series of steps as discussed with respect to FIG. 3. For clarity, the following detailed discussion includes the steps of producing the first article of footwear based on a customized design. However, it should be understood that these same steps apply to the production of the second, complementary article of footwear as well. The following detailed discussion discusses the steps of applying a customized footwear representation to an article of footwear. In some embodiments, a footwear representation to be applied to an article of footwear may be pre-designated by the manufacturer or by a third party designer. In other words, the design to be applied to an article of footwear need not be created using the customization system previously discussed. For clarity, the following detailed description discusses steps for applying a customer created customized design to an article of footwear, however it should be kept in mind that the customized design may include designs created by the manufacturer, a third party designer, or anyone else. Additionally, in some embodiments, a design for an article of footwear may be originally designed as a two dimensional surface. In such an embodiment, the following steps of converting a three dimensional design into two-dimensional portions may be skipped. Preferably, a customization system may include provisions for converting a three-dimensional customized footwear representation into two-dimensional portions that may be printed onto a two dimensional surface. In some embodiments, these provisions may include a step for associating the two-dimensional portions with a two-dimensional surface. In a preferred embodiment, the two-dimensional portions may be oriented in a manner that reduces the space between them. This optimization step may be included in order to reduce the amount of excess sheet material that is used once the two-dimensional portions are printed onto the sheet material. Referring to FIGS. 11-15, converting the customized design of a footwear representation into flat portions that may be printed preferably includes several steps. During a first step, customized footwear representation 1100 may be divided into several portions. A preferred embodiment of the division of customized footwear representation 1100 may be visualized with first boundary 1180, second boundary 1182, and third boundary 1184. In this embodiment, first boundary 1180 separates forefoot portion 1186 from medial portion 1188 and lateral portion 1190. Second boundary 1182 also separates cuff portion 1192 from medial portion 1188 and lateral portion 1190. Similarly, third boundary 1184 preferably separates heel portion 1194 from medial portion 1188 and lateral portion 1190. A fourth boundary, not shown here, separates medial portion 1188 and lateral portion 1190 along the top of customized footwear representation 1100. FIG. 13 is an isometric exploded view of portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192 and 1194 into which customized footwear representation 1100 may be divided. Preferably, each of the portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192, and 1194 is configured so that they may be flattened along a two dimensional surface. During a third and final step, following the division of customized footwear representation 1100 into various portions, an optimization procedure is performed in order to minimize the amount of excess material between each portion along a two dimensional layout. In a preferred embodiment, each of the portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192, and 1194 may be rearranged along a two-dimensional surface in order to minimize the space between them. The preceding discussion of a layout procedure uses FIGS. 13-15 for illustrative purposes only. Generally, the layout may be managed by a computer algorithm that uses calculations to determine an optimized layout. The steps discussed here are only intended to figuratively represent the general procedure by which an algorithm may optimize the layout of two dimensional portions. Finally, a pre-configured size of sheet material 1300 may be selected based on the final arrangement of portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192, and 1194, as seen in FIG. 16. In this embodiment, the outlines of portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192, and 1194 may be visualized for illustrative purposes only. Generally, the outlines of these portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192, and 1194 may not be apparent until sheet material 1300 has been placed through a printer. Sheet material 1300 may be any material associated with manufacturing articles of footwear. Example sheet materials include, but are not limited to, felt, leather, synthetic leather, and/or micro-fiber. Generally, any suitable knitted, woven, and/or non-woven textile material may be used as sheet material 1300. Additionally combinations of these materials may also be used to form a composite material. In a preferred embodiment, sheet material 1300 may be synthetic leather. Generally, the size of sheet material 1300 may vary. Some articles of footwear may be configured to different shoe sizes as well as different shoe styles. These variations may require various different sheet material sizes. In a preferred embodiment, sheet material 1300 may be a stock material that is provided as a continuous roll. In other embodiments, sheet material 1300 may be a cut sheet. Using a stock material, only the necessary amount of material can be processed or printed. This can help to reduce waste. In some embodiments, sheet material 1300 may be configured for printing two complementary articles of footwear. Generally, as was done for first customized footwear representation, a second customized footwear representation would be divided into two-dimensional portions. An optimized layout for both articles of footwear would include these additional two-dimensional portions as well. Referring to FIG. 17, a customization system preferably includes provisions for applying any designs including customized designs to sheet material 1300. In some embodiments, printer 1402 may be used to apply customized designs to sheet material 1300. Generally, printer 1402 may be any type of printer, including, but not limited to a dot matrix printer, an ink jet printer, a laser printer, as well as other kind of printer. In a preferred embodiment, printer 1402 may be any digital printer. In some embodiments, a custom design may be applied to sheet material 1300 using a film transfer, or film lamination method. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 18, the custom design may be printed onto film 1450. Any technique may be used to print onto film 1450, including the techniques mentioned above. In some embodiments, film 1450 may be a thin layer of polyurethane. In other embodiments, film 1450 may be a material containing polyester. Preferably, the design may be printed in reverse, on a printed side 1452 of film 1450. The printed side 1452 can then be placed against sheet material 1300, as shown in FIG. 18. Printing in reverse on printed side 1452 allows the correct image of the custom design to appear when film 1450 is flipped so that printed side 1452 confronts sheet material 1300, and the custom design is viewed through upper side 1454 of film 1450. Preferably, film 1450 is substantially transparent, allowing the custom design to be visible from upper side 1454 of film 1450. It should be understood that in some cases the application of a printed design to an article of footwear may include printing the entire article of footwear. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 19, the entirety of portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192, and/or 1194 may be colored. Referring to FIG. 19, shading applied to entire portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192 and 1194 represents an embodiment where substantially the entire upper of an article of footwear has been colored by a digital printing process. In other words, it is not simply images, stripes or other designs that are printed onto film 1450 and associated with sheet material 1300, but also the background portions, which can be thought of as analogous to base colors of the article, have been printed as a specific color. In some embodiments, the background or base coloring may exceed the expected cut out region of portion 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192, or 1194. This can be referred to as bleeding, and this can be done to insure that the entire portion is completely colored, and that minor printing errors, misalignment, or cutting variations do not reveal blank, uncolored areas. Even in cases where the sheet material is substantially identical in color to the background color of portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192 and 1194, the background may still be printed to film 1450 or directly to sheet material 1300. This preferred configuration may also be true for other embodiments. Generally, all the material used to manufacture an upper for an article of footwear may be cut from sheet material 1300. Additionally, any portion of sheet material 1300 may be printed to, and therefore any of the material used to manufacture the upper of an article of footwear using this method may be printed. This is useful since, as previously discussed, the sheet material may be made of a material with a color that is different from the desired background color of the footwear representation designed by a customer or other party. With this method, the entirety of the article of footwear may be made to have any background color (or colors) designed by the customer or another party. This method of printing onto the entirety of the material configured to be used in manufacturing an article of footwear is preferred over traditional methods of printing to articles of footwear or clothing that only provide a method of printing to a portion of the article. These traditional methods lack the means of printing to the entirety of the material configured for use in making the upper of an article of footwear. Instead, they generally rely on printing a single image, design, text, or portion of an article, including articles of footwear. Once film 1450 has been associated with material 1300, several methods may be used to bond film 1450 to sheet material 1300. Generally, applying heat and/or pressure to film 1450 may cause film 1450 to bond with sheet material 1300. In FIG. 20, press 1460 preferably applies pressure and heat to film 1450, including ink layer 1462. This pressing and heating process preferably attaches film 1450, including ink layer 1462 to sheet material 1300. In other embodiments, in the process of attaching a film to a sheet material, a texture may be applied to the film. In some embodiments, an embossing plate or a plate with a textured release paper may be used. In other embodiments, an embossing roll may be used. FIG. 21 is a preferred embodiment of a system for attaching a film to sheet material 1300. In this embodiment, film 1470, including ink layer 1472, has just been bonded to sheet material 1300 by press 1476, using heat and pressure. In this embodiment, press 1476 includes a textured surface 1474. This textured surface 1474 deflects or plastically deforms the upper surface 1478 of film 1470. In some embodiments, press 1476 may be referred to as an embossing plate. However, in other embodiments, a textured paper may be attached to the lower surface 1475—which in this embodiment is smooth—of press 1476, to apply a texture to film 1470. In another embodiment, shown in FIG. 22, film 1480, including ink layer 1482, can be bonded to sheet material 1300 using embossing roll 1484. In this embodiment, the upper surface of film 1480 is plastically deformed under the heat and pressure applied by embossing roll 1484 during the bonding process. This results in a composite structure of film 1480, having a textured surface 1490, attached to substrate 1300. Using one of the preferred film transfer techniques described here, the design of an article of footwear may not be limited by the processes associated with simple printing techniques. Instead, film transfer methods may be used to provide textured surfaces due to deformations of the film itself during an embossing process, or through the use of release paper. Therefore, the finished product may include various textures in addition to colors and other visible design features. In some embodiments, printer 1402 may be used to apply a protective coating directly to sheet material 1300, without the use of a film transfer technique, once a customized design has been printed onto sheet material 1300. In some embodiments, printer 1402 may apply protective coating 1502, as seen in FIG. 23. Preferably, protective coating 1502 is applied on top of ink layer 1504. FIG. 25 is a two dimensional layout of portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192, and 1194, disposed along sheet material 1300. In some embodiments, sheet material 1300 may also include first label 1601, second label 1602, third label 1603, fourth label 1604, and fifth label 1605. Generally, labels 1601-1605 may be used to describe the names of portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192, and 1194, respectively. For example, in this embodiment, first label 1601 may be FRONT, second label 1602 may be MEDIAL, third label 1603 may be LATERAL, fourth label 1604 may be CUFF, and fifth label 1605 may be REAR. Using this configuration, a worker who may facilitate the assembly of the various pieces into a final article of footwear may know how to assemble the portions together. Preferably, a customization system includes provisions for removing portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192, and 1194 from sheet material 1300. In some embodiments, the customization system may include cutting machine 1702, seen in FIG. 26. Generally, cutting machine 1702 may be any kind of device that cuts portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192, and 1194 from sheet material 1300. In some embodiments, cutting machine 1702 may include blade 1704. In other embodiments, cutting machine 1702 may include other provisions for removing portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192, and 1194 from sheet material 1300. In some embodiments, cutting may be done via a laser. Referring to FIG. 27, once portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192, and 1194 have been removed from sheet material 1300, they may be assembled. In this embodiment, portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192 and 1194 have already been assembled with outsole 1802 to construct article of footwear 1800. Forefoot portion 1186 is preferably configured to attach to medial portion 1188, lateral portion 1190, and outsole 1802. Generally, the assembly of article of footwear 1800 may be accomplished by stitching together portions 1186, 1188, 1190, 1192 and 1194. In some embodiments, a worker may accomplish the stitching. In other embodiments, an automated machine may accomplish the stitching. In a preferred embodiment, a worker may facilitate stitching that is accomplished by an automated machine. Once article of footwear 1800 has been fully assembled, it may be inspected for quality by the manufacturer. During this step, the assembled article of footwear 1800 may be compared to the customer designed footwear representation. Therefore, article of footwear 1800 is not only inspected for structural integrity, but also for design accuracy. Finally, once article of footwear 1800 has passed inspection, it may be prepared to ship to the customer. FIG. 28 is a preferred embodiment of article of footwear 1800 being placed inside shipping box 1900. Here, second article of footwear 1902 has already been manufactured, inspected, and placed inside shipping box 1900. At this point, articles of footwear 1800 and 1902 may be shipped to a pre-designated shipping address. While various embodiments of the invention have been described, the description is intended to be exemplary, rather than limiting and it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible that are within the scope of the invention.
