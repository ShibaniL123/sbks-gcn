4-[(S)-2-((S)-2-Acetamido-3-phenylpropanamido)-2-(4-ethylthiazol-2-yl)ethyl]phenylsulfamic acid (15)
Preparation of (S)-2-acetamido-N-[(S)-1-(4-ethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-ethyl]-3-phenylpropanamide (14): To a solution of 1-(S)-(4-ethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethyl amine hydrobromide, 3, (0.343 g, 0.957 mmol), N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine (0.218 g), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (0.161g), diisopropyl-ethylamine (0.26 g), in DMF (10 mL) at 0°, is added 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDCI) (0.201 g). The mixture is stirred at 0 °C for 30 minutes then at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture is diluted with water and extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic phase is washed with 1 N aqueous HCl, 5 % aqueous NaHCO3, water and brine, and dried over Na2SO4. The solvent is removed in vacuo to afford 0.313 g (70 % yield) of the desired product which is used without further purification. LC/MS ESI+ 467 (M+1).
