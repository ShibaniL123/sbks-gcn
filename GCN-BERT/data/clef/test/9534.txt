Step 2. N-Acetyl-N-(7-chloroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-8-yl)acetamide
To a solution of 7-chloroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-8-amine (0.50 g, 3.0 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (37 mg, 0.30 mmol) in DCM (20 mL) at 0° C. was added triethylamine (2.5 mL, 18 mmol) and then acetic anhydride (0.84 mL, 9.0 mmol). After coming to room temperature, the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 0° C., and acetyl chloride (0.42 mL, 6.0 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature, stirred for 3 h, and then heated at reflux for 4 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with DCM and washed successively with sat. NaHCO3, water, and brine. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography (1-10% MeOH in DCM) afforded the title compound as a brown solid (0.68 g, 90%). LCMS for C11H11ClN3O2 (M+H)+: calculated m/z=252.1; found 252.0.
