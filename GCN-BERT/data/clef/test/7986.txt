Step 1. (4-(Hydroxymethyl)-2-oxabicyclo[2.1.]hexan-1-yl)methyl acetate
To a solution of (1-(iodomethyl)-2-oxabicyclo[2.1.1]hexan-4-yl)methanol (874 mg, 3.4 mmol, Example 424, Step 2) in DMF (6.0 mL) was added cesium acetate (990 mg, 5.2 mmol), and the reaction mixture was heated to 100Â° C. for 2 h. The reaction mixture was partitioned between water and EtOAc and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (0-100% EtOAc/hexanes, followed by 15% MeOH/DCM) to afford the title compound (326 mg, 51%).
