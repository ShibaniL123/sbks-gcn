(6) Preparation of (2S,5R)-7-oxo-2-(spiro[3.3]heptan-2-ylcarbamoyl)-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate
(2S,5R)-6-hydroxyl-7-oxo-N-(spiro[3.3]heptan-2-yl)-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-car boxamide (225 mg, 0.81 mmol), sulfur trioxide-trimethylamine complex (125 mg, 0.90 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture solvent of isopropanol (15 mL) and water (15 mL), reacted at 25°C for 12h, water (50 mL) was added, washed with ethyl acetate (50 mL), to the aqueous phase was added tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (9.6 g, 60 mmol), reacted at 25°C for 1h, the aqueous phase was extracted with dichloromethane, the organic phase was dried, concentrated in vacuum, washed with acetonitrile (1 mL), suck filtrated to obtain product as a white solid (63 mg, yield 21.8%).
