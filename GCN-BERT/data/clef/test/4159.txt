Example 1. (R)-3-(3-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)pyrrolidine-1-yl)-3-oxopropanenitrile
103 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 10-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 4.70 mL of n-butanol. After 0.505 mL of ethyl cyanoacetate was added thereto, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0360 mL of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), and then heated at about 80Â°C for about 24 hours. After termination of the reaction, the reaction solution was distilled under reduced pressure to remove the solvent. The resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 101 mg of (R)-3-(3-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)pyrrolidine-1-yl)-3-oxopropanenitrile was obtained with a yield of about 74.8%.
