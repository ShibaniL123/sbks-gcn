SMAC MIMETIC Field of the Invention This invention is in the field of SMAC mimetics and compositions and uses thereof to treat proliferative disorders including cancers. Background of the Invention Inhibitors of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs) are naturally occurring intra-cellular proteins that suppress caspase-dependent apoptosis. SMAC, also known as DIABLO, is another intracellular protein that functions to antagonize, i.e., inhibit the activity of IAPs. In normal healthy cells, SMAC and IAPs function together to maintain healthy cells. However, in certain disease states, e.g., cancers and other proliferative disorders, IAPs are not adequately antagonized and therefore prevent apoptosis and cause or exacerbate abnormal proliferation and survival. SMAC mimetics, also known as IAP antagonists, are synthetic small molecules that mimic the structure and IAP antagonist activity of the four N-terminal amino acids of SMAC. (SMAC mimetics are sometimes referred to as IAP antagonists.) When administered to animals suffering proliferative disorders, the SMAC mimetics antagonize IAPs, causing an increase in apoptosis among abnormally proliferating cells. Examples of SMAC peptidomimetics are those disclosed in US 7,517,906; US 7,309,792; US 7,419,975; US 2005/0234042; US 2005/0261203; US 2006/0014700; US 2006/0025347; US 2006/0052311; US 2006/0128632; US 2006/0167066; US 2007/0042428; US 2007/032437; US 2008/0132485; WO 2005/069888; WO 2005/069894; WO 2006/010118; WO 2006/122408; WO 2006/017295; WO 2006/133147; WO 2006/128455; WO 2006/091972; WO 2006/020060; WO 2006/014361; WO 2006/097791; WO 2005/094818; WO 2008/045905; WO 2008/016893; WO 2007/136921; WO 2007/021825; WO 2007/130626; WO 2007/106192; and WO 2007/101347.

In some embodiments of the invention, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compound of the invention, alone or in combination with one or more other active pharmaceutical ingredients, are administered to a human or veterinary subject. The pharmaceutical compositions typically comprise at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, e.g., a carrier or diluent, and can be administered in the conventional manner by routes including systemic, topical, or oral routes. Administration is normally by intravenous injection, either as a bolus or infusion, but other routes of administration are not precluded. An intravenous formulation can be 1 mg/mL of Compound 15 in sterile 0.05Μ citrate buffered PBS, ρΗ5. Specific modes of administration will depend on the indication and other factors including the particular compound being administered. The amount of compound to be administered is that amount which is therapeutically effective. The dosage to be administered will depend on the characteristics of the subject being treated, e.g., the particular patient treated, age, weight, health, types of concurrent treatment, if any. Frequency of treatments can be easily determined by one of skill in the art (e.g., by the clinician). Typically, the compound of the invention will be administered by intravenous injection, including, e.g., by infusion over about 1 to about 120 minutes, e.g., about 30 minutes. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention is a composition in which the active pharmaceutical ingredient, i.e., the compound of the invention, is pure enough, and the composition is otherwise suitable, for internal administration to a human or other mammal. It can he prepared in unit dose form, i.e., a form suitable for single administration to a subject. So, e.g., a pharmaceutical composition in intra-venous unit dose form may comprise a vial or pre-filled syringe, each comprising an effective amount or a convenient fraction of an effective amount such that one the contents of one vial or syringe are administered at a time. Such administration can be repeated up to about 4 times per day over a period of time, if necessary to achieve a cumulative effective dose, e.g., tumor regression. A dosing regimen can be, e.g., daily or twice-weekly intravenous injections, or, e.g., weekly injections in cycles of three weeks on and one week off for as long as the treatment is effective, e.g., until disease progresses or the drug is not tolerated. The effective dose administered in each injection is an amount that is effective and tolerated; it can be, e.g., 0.01 to 30 mg/m2, e.g., 0.2 to 10 mg/m2, or, e.g., 0.5 to 5 mg/m2. The compound of the invention can also be applied locally, such as in isolated limb perfusion. The compound of the invention can also be applied topically, e.g., as a cream, gel, lotion, or ointment, or in a reservoir or matrix-type patch, or in an active transdennal delivery system. An effective dose is one that over the course of therapy, which may be, e.g., 1 or more weeks, e.g., multiple courses of 3 weeks on/1 week off, results in tr eatment of the proliferative disorder, i.e., a decrease in the rate of disease progression, termination of disease progression, or regression or remission. Pharmaceutical compositions to be used comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound as described above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or other form thereof together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The phrase "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a composition suitable for administration in medical use. It should be appreciated that the determinations of proper dosage forms, dosage amounts, and routes of administration for a particular patient are within the level of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical and medical arts. Compositions suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile aqueous preparation of the compound of the invention, which is preferably isotonic with the blood of the recipient. This aqueous preparation may be formulated according to known methods using suitable carriers or diluents which may include a buffer. When practicing the conjoint or combination therapy described in more detail below, the administration of the compound and compositions of the present invention can occur simultaneous with, subsequent to, or prior to chemotherapy or radiation, so long as the chemotherapeutic agent or radiation sensitizes the system to the compound and compositions of the present invention. The present invention also is directed to the use of the compound and compositions as a chemopotentiating agent with other treatment approaches. The term "chemopotentiating agent" refers to an agent that acts to increase the sensitivity of an organism, tissue, or cell to a chemical compound, or treatment namely "chemotherapeutic agents" or "chemo drugs" or to radiation treatment. Thus, compound and compositions of the present invention can be used for inhibiting tumor growth in vivo by administering them in combination with a biologic or chemotherapeutic agent or by using them in combination with radiation. In these applications, the administration of the compound and compositions of the present invention may occur prior to, and with sufficient time, to cause sensitization of the site to be treated. Alternatively, the compound and compositions of the present invention may be used contemporaneously with radiation and/or additional anti-cancer chemical agents (infra). Such systems can avoid repeated administrations of the compound and compositions of the present invention, increasing convenience to the subject and the physician, and may be particularly suitable for certain compositions of the present invention. Biological and chemotherapeutics/anti-neoplastic agents and radiation induce apoptosis by activating the extrinsic or intrinsic apoptotic pathways, and, since the compound and compositions of the present invention relieve antagonists of apoptotic proteins (IAPs) and, thus, remove the block in apoptosis, the combination of chemotherapeutics/anti-neoplastic agents and radiation with the compound and compositions of the present invention should work additively or synergistically to facilitate apoptosis. A combination of the compound of the present invention and a biological or chemotherapeutic/anti neoplastic agent and/or radiation therapy of any type that activates the extrinsic or intrinsic pathway may provide a more effective approach to destroying tumor cells. The compound of the present invention interacts with IAP's, such as XIAP, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, ML-IAP, etc., and removes the IAP mediated block of apoptosis. Most chemotherapeutics/anti neoplastic agents and/or radiation therapy kills actively dividing cells by activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway leading to apoptosis and cell death. Biological antitumor agents such as TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand) activate extrinsic apoptotic pathways. As is described in more detail below, embodiments of the invention provide combinations of the compound of the present invention and a biological or chemotherapeutic/anti-neoplastic agent and/or radiation which provide a synergistic action against unwanted cell proliferation. This synergistic action between the compound of the present invention and a biological or chemotherapeutic/anti-neoplastic agent and/or radiation therapy can improve the efficiency of the biological or chemotherapeutic/anti-neoplastic agent and/or radiation therapies. This will allow for an increase in the effectiveness of current biological or chemotherapeutic/anti-neoplastic agents or radiation treatments allowing a higher percentage of tumors to respond to the therapy, an improved tumor response, and, potentially, a reduction in the dose of the biological or chemotherapeutic/anti-neoplastic agent needed to treat a tumor, thereby providing the use of a more tolerable dose of biological or chemotherapeutic/anti-neoplastic agent and/or radiation. In an embodiment of the present invention, the patient is treated by administering the compound or a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention at a time the patient is subject to concurrent or antecedent radiation or chemotherapy for treatment of a neoproliferative pathology of a tumor such as, but not limited to, bladder cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, hepatoma, melanoma, lymphoma, sarcoma, and combinations thereof. In another embodiment of the present invention, the compound or a composition of the present invention can be administered in combination with a biological or chemotherapeutic and/or for use in combination with radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or photodynamic therapy, promoting apoptosis and enhancing the effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or photodynamic therapy. Embodiments of the invention also include a method of treating a patient afflicted with cancer by the contemporaneous or concurrent administration of a biological or chemotherapeutic agent. Such biological or chemotherapeutic agents include but are not limited to the chemotherapeutic agents described in "Modem Pharmacology with Clinical Applications", Sixth Edition, Craig & Stitzel, Chpt. 56, pg 639-656 (2004), herein incorporated by reference. The chemotherapeutic agent can be, but is not limited to, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, anti-tumor antibiotics, plant-derived products such as taxanes, enzymes, hormonal agents, miscellaneous agents such as cisplatin, monoclonal antibodies, glucocorticoids, mitotic inhibitors, topoisomerase I inhibitors, topoisomerase II inhibitors, immunomodulating agents such as interferons, cellular growth factors, cytokines, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory compounds (NSAID), cellular growth factors and kinase inhibitors. Other suitable classifications for chemotherapeutic agents include mitotic inhibitors,and anti-estrogenic agents. Specific examples of suitable biological and chemotherapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, cisplatin, carmustine (BCNU), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cytarabine (Ara-C), gemcitabine, methotrexate, daunombicin, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, topotecan, etoposide, paclitaxel, vincristine, tamoxifen, TNF-alpha, TRAIL and other members, i.e., other than TRAIL and TNF-alpha, of the TNF superfamily of molecules., interferon (in both its alpha and beta forms), thalidomide, thalidomide derivatives such as lenalidomide, melphalan, and PARP inhibitors. Other specific examples of suitable chemotherapeutic agents include nitrogen mustards such as cyclophosphamide, alkyl sulfonates, nitrosoureas, ethylenimines, triazenes, folate antagonists, purine analogs, pyrimidine analogs, anthracyclines, bleomycins, mitomycins, dactinomycins, plicamycin, vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, taxanes, glucocorticoids, L-asparaginase, estrogens, androgens, progestins, luteinizing hormones, octreotide actetate, hydroxyurea, procarbazine, mitotane, hexamethylmelamine, carboplatin, mitoxantrone, monoclonal antibodies, levamisole, interferons, interleukins, filgrastim and sargramostim. Another embodiment of the present invention relates to the use of the compound or a composition of the present invention in combination with topoisomerase inhibitors to potentiate their apoptotic inducing effect. Topoisomerase inhibitors inhibit DNA replication and repair, thereby promoting apoptosis and are used as chemothemotherapeutic agents. Topoisomerase inhibitors promote DNA damage by inhibiting the enzymes that are required in the DNA repair process. Therefore, export of Smac from the mitochondria into the cell cytosol is provoked by the DNA damage caused by topoisomerase inhibitors. Topoisomerase inhibitors of both the Type I class (camptothecin, topotecan, SN-38 (irinotecan active metabolite) and the Type II class (etoposide) are expected to show potent synergy with compounds of the present invention. Further examples of topoisomerase inhibiting agents that may be used include, but are not limited to, irinotecan, topotecan, etoposide, amsacrine, exatecan, gimatecan, etc. Other topoisomerase inhibitors include, for example, Aclacinomycin A, camptothecin, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, ellipticine, epirubicin, and mitaxantrone. Another embodiment of the present invention relates to the use of the compound or a composition of the present invention in combination with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In another embodiment of the invention, the chemotherapeutic/anti^-neoplastic agent for use in combination with the compound and compositions of the present invention may be a platinum containing compound. In one embodiment of the invention, the platinum containing compound is cisplatin. Cisplatin can synergize with a compound of the present invention and potentiate the inhibition of an IAP, such as but not limited to Χ1ΑΡ, cIAP-1, c-IAP-2, ML-IAP, etc. In another embodiment a platinum containing compound is carboplatin. Carboplatin can synergize with a compound of the present invention and potentiate the inhibition of an IAP, including, but not limited to, Χ1ΛΡ, cIAP-1, c-IAP-2, ML-IAP, etc. In another embodiment a platinum containing compound is oxaliplatin. The oxaliplatin can synergize with a compound of the present invention and potentiate the inhibition of an IAP, including, but not limited to, XIAP, cIAP-1, c-IAP-2, ML-IAP, etc. Platinum chemotherapy drugs belong to a general group of DNA modifying agents. DNA modifying agents may be any highly reactive chemical compound that bonds with various nucleophilic groups in nucleic acids and proteins and cause mutagenic, carcinogenic, or cytotoxic effects. DNA modifying agents work by different mechanisms, disruption of DNA function and cell death; DNA damage/the formation of cross-bridges or bonds between atoms in the DNA; and induction of mispairing of the nucleotides leading to mutations, to achieve the same end result. Three non-limiting examples of a platinum containing DNA modifying agents are cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin. Yet another embodiment of the present invention is the therapeutic combination or the therapeutic use in combination of the compound or compositions of the present invention with TRAIL or TRAIL agonist antibodies, or other chemical or biological agents which bind to and activate the TRAIL receptor(s). Many cancer cell types are sensitive to TRAILinduced apoptosis, while most normal cells appear to be resistant to this action of TRAIL. TRAIL-resistant cells may arise by a variety of different mechanisms including loss of the receptor, presence of decoy receptors, overexpression of FLIP which competes for zymogen caspase-8 binding during DISC formation and inhibition of activated caspase-3 and/or caspase-9 by XIAP. In TRAIL resistance, a compound or composition of the present invention may increase tumor cell sensitivity to TRAIL leading to enhanced cell death, the clinical correlations of which are expected to be increased apoptotic activity in TRAIL resistant tumors, improved clinical response, increased response duration, and ultimately, enhanced patient survival rate. In another embodiment of the invention, Compound 15 is administered in combination with a cytokine, e.g., TNFa. The compound and compositions of the present invention also can be used to augment radiation therapy (or radiotherapy), i.e., the medical use of ionizing radiation as part of cancer treatment to control malignant cells. Although radiotherapy is often used as part of curative therapy, it is occasionally used as a palliative treatment, where cure is not possible and the aim is for symptomatic relief. Radiotherapy is commonly used for the treatment of tumors. It may be used as the primary therapy. It is also common to combine radiotherapy with surgery and/or chemotherapy. The most common tumors treated with radiotherapy are breast cancer, prostate cancer, rectal cancer, head & neck cancers, gynecological tumors, bladder cancer and lymphoma. Radiation therapy is commonly applied just to the localized area involved with the tumor. Often the radiation fields also include the draining lymph nodes. It is possible but uncommon to give radiotherapy to the whole body, or entire skin surface. Radiation therapy is usually given daily for up to 35-38 fractions (a daily dose is a fraction). These small frequent doses allow healthy cells time to grow back, repairing damage inflicted by the radiation. Three main divisions of radiotherapy are external beam radiotherapy or teletherapy, brachytherapy or sealed source radiotherapy and unsealed source radiotherapy, which are all suitable examples of treatment protocol in the present invention. The differences relate to the position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, while sealed and unsealed source radiotherapy has radioactive material delivered internally. Brachytherapy sealed sources are usually extracted later, while unsealed sources are injected into the body. Compound 15 is capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including but not limited to acid addition and/or base addition salts. Such salts are included within all aspects of the invention. It is intended that the present invention encompass Compound 15 synthesized in vitro using laboratory techniques, such as those well known to synthetic chemists; or synthesized using in vivo techniques, such as through metabolism, fermentation, digestion, and the like. It is also contemplated that the compound of the present invention may be synthesized using a combination of in vitro and in vi vo techniques. The present invention also includes isotopically-enriched compounds, which are identical to Compound 15 but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be included in the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 160, 170,31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36C1. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, are also included. Isotopically enriched compounds of this invention can generally be prepared by substituting a readily available isotopically labelled reagent for a non-isotopically enriched reagent. For example, incorporation of deuterium can be accomplished by substituting sodium borohydride with frTsodi um borohydride, or by replacing iodomethane with rid-iodomethane. Representative examples of specific deuterated analogs and their preparation are described in Example 1. Compound 15 may exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. Furthermore, Compound 15 may exist in various solid states including crystalline, semi-crystalline and amorphous (noncrystalline) forms, and in the form of clathrates, prodrugs, polymorphs, bio-hydrolyzable esters, racemic mixtures, non-racemic mixtures, or as purified stereoisomers including, but not limited to, optically pure enantiomers and diastereomers. In general, all of these and other such forms are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the term, Compound 15. References to Compound 15 and to the compound of the invention, and other similar phrases in this specification and in the claims, are intended to include not only the compound of formula (I), but also pharmaceutically acceptable salts of Compound 15, as well as various forms of said compound or salts thereof such as those that are described above and below. In additional embodiments, the invention comprises compounds useful as intermediates in the synthesis of Compound 15, as well as in processes for preparing such intermediates and Compound 15. For example, in such embodiments, the invention comprises compounds shown in the Examples, below, such as Compounds 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and the isotopically enriched compounds such as Compounds 18 through 32. One such embodiment is Compound 15 in which the 4-OH substituent on the pyrrolidine moiety is protected with a protecting group. An illustrative protecting group is an acetyl group, which is illustrated in Compounds 11-14, below. Other useful protecting groups will be apparent to persons of skill in the art and include, e.g., benzoyl, benzyl, trimethylsilyl, and triphenylmethyl groups. The protecting group is removed, e.g., by contacting the protected intermediate with an acid or a base, as shown in Schemes XIII and XIV, below. Thus, the invention comprises the compound having the structure of Compound 15 as well as protected versions of Compound 15 such as Compounds 13 and 14 in which the N-termini are protected with carbamate moieties and/or free hydroxyl groups are protected as esters such compounds being herein referred to as Protected Compound 15. The invention further comprises the step of deprotecting a Protected Compound 15 by contacting the Protected Compound 15 with an acid or base whereby the Protecting Group is removed to afford Compound 15. Isotopically emiched compounds of the invention include deuterated forms of Compound 15 such as Compounds 20, 29, and 32. Protected forms of such compounds, e.g., Compounds 19, 28, and 31, are also comprised within the invention.

Briefly, Α375 cell lines expressing GFP-tagged cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 were generated by transfecting HA2xEGFP-pcDNA3 vector containing either cIAP-1 (A375Gcl) or cIAP-2 (A375Gc2) coding region. 2χ104 of A375Gcl or A375Gc2 cells were grown in 96-well plate and treated with various concentrations of test compounds for 2 h. After incubation, cells were collected by trypsinization and suspended in 150 μΐ of DMEM-10% FBS. A total of 104 cells were analyzed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). GFP fluorescence was monitored by using an excitation filter at 488 nm and emission was measured with a 530 nm filter. IC50 is defined as the concentration of drug at which 50% of GFP signal was inhibited. Results of the clAP-1 and -2 degradation assay are shown in Table 2.

Example 2Β. Caspase-3 Derepression Assay Exponentially growing MDA-MB-231 tumor cells (ATCC) were harvested by trypsinization and collected by centrifugation in a table top centrifuge at lOOOxg for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cell pellet was washed one time by resuspending in 5 mL hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, ρΗ7.5, 10 mM KC1, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1.0 mM EDTA, 1.0 mM DTT) and recollected by centrifugation. Pellet was next resuspended in 1 volume of hypotonic lysis buffer supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche) and allowed to swell on ice for 30 minutes. Cells were disrupted by approximately 50 passages through a 27 gauge needle. Lysis was monitored by light microscopy. Lysate was centrifuged at 12000xg for 10 minutes at 4°C to remove membrane fraction, unlysed cells and debris. The soluble fraction was collected for protein concentration determination and subsequent assay analysis. The hypotonic lysate (25 pg protein), 50 pg/mL cytochrome c and 10 mM dATP were combined in a microcentrifuge tube to a final volume of 9 pi in hypotonic lysis buffer followed by addition of test compound and incubated for 30 minutes at room temp. Following incubation 50 pi of hypotonic lysis buffer containing 5 ρΜ of pro-fluorescent rhodamine-110(2) based caspase-3 substrate zDEVD-Rl 10(2) was added and fluorescence intensity was monitored over time. Activation of the lysate by addition of cytochrome c and dATP results in apoptosome formation and subsequent activation of caspases-9 and -3. Endogenous XIAP inhibits much of this activity and addition of test compound to the activated lysate results in more caspase activity than is generated by activated lysate alone as measured by increase in fluorescence intensity upon cleavage of zDEVD-Rl 10(2) by caspase-3. IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism by plotting increase in fluorescence intensity vs. different concentrations of compounds tested and the results are shown in Table 3.

Example 3 - Cytotoxicity SKOV-3 ovarian tumor cell cytotoxicity data were generated substantially as follows. The ΜΤΤ (3-(4.5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltelrazolium bromide) assay is an example of an assay that has been used for measuring cell growth as previously described (Hansen, Μ. Β., Nielsen, S. Ε., and Berg, Κ. (1989) J. Immunol. Methods119, 203-210) and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, SK-OV-3 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in McCoy’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum albumin (5,000 per well) and incubated overnight at 37°C. The next day, test compounds were added at various concentrations (0.003-10 μΜ) and the plates were incubated at 37°C for an additional 72 hrs. This incubation time was optimal for measuring inhibitory effects of different analogs. Fifty microliters of 5mg/mL ΜΤΤ reagent to each well was added and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 3 hours. At the end of the incubation period, 50 microliters of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve cells and the optical density (OD) of the wells was measured using a microplate reader (Victor2 1420, Wallac, Finland) at 535 nm. Cell survival (CS) was calculated by the following equation: CS = (OD treated well/ mean OD control wells) X 100% The CC5o, defined as the drug concentration that results in 50% CS, was derived by calculating the point where the dose-response curve crosses the 50% CS point using GraphPad Prism. These results suggest that Smac mimetics that bind to cIAP-1 can be used in the treatment of cancer either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapeutics. The results of SKOV-3 cytotoxicity assays for the compounds tested in this assay are shown in Table 4.

Example 4 - Toxicity Body weight loss (BWL), mortality and additional toxicity data were generated substantially as follows. Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed daily (QDx4, i.v. bolus slow push) with Compounds 15, 4 and 5. Body weights were taken on day 4 and are shown as percent change from day 1. Compounds 4 and 5 were administered at 0.3 mg/Kg, 1 mg/Kg, or 3 mg/Kg; Compound 15 was administered at 1, 5, or 10 mg/Kg. The results of the BWL assay are shown in Fig 1. Mortality, Compounds 4 and 5 were not tolerated at 3 mg/Kg, and caused the animals to die at this dose. No mortality was observed with Compound 15 at 5 mg/Kg (mortality was observed at 10 mg/Kg.) Clinical Results. There were no clinical signs noted at 1 mg/kg/day with Compound 15 after 4 days of administration. Animals treated with Compound 15 at 5 mg/kg/day exhibited clinical signs similar to Compounds 4 and 5 at 1 mg/kg/day such as lethargy, increased/irregular respiration and increased heart rate. Rats treated with 1 mg/kg Compound 5 exhibited additional clinical observations including dehydration, ungroomed appearance, chromorhinorrhea, alopecia (head), and excessive scratching from days 2 to 4. Body Weight. At 1 mg/Kg, animals receiving Compounds 4 and 5 lost weight whereas animals receiving Compound 15 at 1 mg/kg/day gained weight. At 5 mg/kg/day with Compound 15, a treatment related mean body weight loss of approximately 8% was noted from day 1 to day 4. A treatment-related mean body weight loss of approximately 4 % and 6 % was noted in animals treated with Compounds 4 and 5, respectively, at 1 mg/kg/day. Pathology. Assessment of anatomic pathology after treatment with Compounds 4 and 5 at 1 mg/kg/day resulted in the following findings. There was marked to severe bone marrow hypocellularity of the erythroid series, mild to moderate hypercellularity of the myeloid series, and mild to moderate hypertrophy and hyperplasia of megakaryocytes in the tibia and sternum when Compounds 4 and 5 were administered at 1 mg/kg/day. For Compounds 4 and 5 the lungs had dose-related mild to moderate diffuse hypertrophy/hyperplasia of Type 2 pneumocytes which were accompanied by an increase in alveolar macrophages, hypertrophied bronchiolar epithelium, proliferating perivascular mononuclear cells and hypertrophied visceral pleural cells. In contrast, assessment of anatomic pathology following treatment with Compound 15 at the same dose (1 mg/kg/day) identified minimal to mild hypocellularity of erythroid cells, minimal to mild hypercellularity of myeloid cells, and minimal Type 2 pneumocyte hypertrophy in the lungs. The data described above indicate that Compound 15 is approximately 5-fold better tolerated in the rat as compared to Compounds 4 and 5 on a dose per dose basis. Example 5 - Tumor Volume Reduction and Body Weight Change MDA-MB-231 xenograft data were generated substantially as follows. MDA-MB-231 human breast tumor cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice and dosing initiated twelve days later at an average tumor volume of approximately 148 mm3. No tumor burden was associated with this model based on lack of weight loss or animal morbidity in control groups. Mice were injected subcutaneously into the mammary fat pad with 1χ107 cells suspended in 200μ1 of a 1:1 HBSS: Matrigel solution ; injected cells were within nine passages of the original lot. Pre-study tumor volumes were recorded beginning approximately one week prior to the estimated start date. When tumors reached approximately 150 mm3 animals are matched by tumor volume into treatment and control groups and dosing initiated (Day 0); mice are tagged and followed individually throughout the experiment. Animals were dosed by weight (0.01 mL per gram; 10 ml/Kg). Beginning on Day 0, animals were observed daily and weighed twice weekly using a digital scale (Ohaus SP601); data including individual and mean gram weights (Mean We ± SD), mean percent weight change versus Day 0 (%vDo) and mean percent weight change versus prior measurement (%vD_x) were recorded for each group and plotted at study completion. Beginning on Day 0, tumor dimensions were measured twice weekly by digital caliper (Fowler Ultra-Cal IV) and data including individual and mean estimated tumor volumes (Mean TV ± SEM) recorded for each group; tumor volume was calculated using the formula: TV~- width2χ length χ 0.52. Individual mice reaching the designated study endpoint (an estimated tumor volume of approximately 1 cm3) were assigned a time to endpoint (ΤΤΕ) value corresponding to that day; the tumor growth delay (TGD) study was concluded once all mice reach the study endpoint or sixty days following study initiation. At study completion, TGD and %TGD are calculated using the median ΤΤΕ (ΜΤΤΕ) value for each treatment (Τ) group versus control (C) by the formulas: TGD(ciaySI- T-C and %TGD=T-C/Cχ100, wherein T-C is the difference between MTTE-Treatment Group and MTTE-Control. Tumored animals not reaching the designated volume endpoint by study completion are considered long-term survivors (LTS) and assigned a ΤΤΕ value corresponding to the final study day; tumor-free animals are not included in TGD calculations. A Log-rank test is used to determine statistically significant differences in overall survival experience between each treated group compared to control. Individual mice reporting a tumor volume <50% of the Day 0 measurement for two consecutive measurements over a seven day period were considered partial responders (PR). If the PR persisted until study completion, percent tumor regression (%TR) was determined using the formula: %TR= 1-Tf / 7) χ/00: a mean value was calculated if multiple PR mice occurred in one group. Individual mice lacking palpable tumors (< 4x4 mm2 for two consecutive measurements over a seven day period) were classified as complete responders (CR); a CR that persisted until study completion was considered a tumor-free survivor (TFS); TFS animals are excluded from TGD calculations and statistical analysis. Statistical differences in ΜΤΤΕ values between control and treatment groups are compared using a Log Rank test. Compound 15 was administered by i.p. injection alone at 20, 40 or 60 mg/Kg on a q3dx5 schedule (every three days for 5 cycles). T-C values of 22 days were calculated for these groups, all of which were found statistically significant compared with control (ρ=0.005, p<0.0001, or p-0.0001). In the 20 mg/Kg group, 6/10 mice were considered long-tenn survivors and partial tumor regression was reported in three mice. In the 40 mg/Kg group, 9/10 mice were considered long-term survivors and partial tumor regression was reported in three mice. In the 60 mg/Kg group, 8/10 mice were considered long-term survivors and partial tumor regression was reported in seven mice. Compound 5 was administered by i.p. injection alone at 15 mg/Kg on a q3dx5 schedule. A T-C value of 21 days was calculated for this group which was found to be statistically significant compared with control (ρ=0.002). In this group 3/10 mice were considered long-term survivors and partial tumor regression was reported in five mice. The efficacy of this dose level produced half the number of long term survivors as 20 mg/Kg of Compound 15. The results of the MDA-MB-231 xenograft assay are shown in Figures 2Α and 2Β. Compound 15 at 20 mg/Kg had comparable anti-tumor activity to Compound 5 at 15 mg/Kg. Subsequent studies have shown that the minimal effective dose of Compound 15 in this model is less than 1 mg/Kg. Weight loss was greater in the mice administered Compound 5 at 15 mg/Kg when compared to the mice dosed with Compound 15 at 20 mg/Kg. Thus, Compound 15 has comparable efficacy with less toxicity relative to Compound 5 and therefore has an improved therapeutic index. The compound of Formula 1 is particularly well tolerated and well suited for use in a pharmaceutical composition, as well as in a method for treating a proliferative disorder or an autoimmune disorder. In particular, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention for the treatment of a proliferative disorder, which comprises an effective amount of Compound 15 in addition to at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, can improve therapeutic index by reducing toxicities. The reduced toxicities include, e.g., one of, or any combination of one or more of: • reduced body weight loss, • decreased incidence of mortality, • reduced bone marrow hypocellularity of the erythroid series, • reduced hypercellularity of the myeloid series, • reduced hypertrophy and hyperplasia of megakaryocytes, • reduced diffuse hypertrophy/hyperplasia of Type 2 pneumocytes • decreased lethargy, • more regular respiration, • lessened increase in heart rate. The reduced toxicities listed above are those observed in the animals tested. Similar, additional, or different reduced toxicities will be observed in humans. The reductions are relative, e.g,, relative to the extent that toxicities would be observed following internal administration of a pharmaceutical composition in which the active pharmaceutical ingredient is an analog of Compound 15, e.g., one or more of the analogs in which R5 is -CH2CH3, CH(CH3)CH3, -K-CH(OH)CH3, -S-CH(OH)CH3, and -/?-CH(OCH3)CH3, e.g., at the same dose or at a dose of comparable potency.
