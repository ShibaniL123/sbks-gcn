Step 2: 3,5-Difluoro-N-methoxy-N-methylisonicotinamide
3,5-difluoro-N-methoxy-N-methylisonicotinamide (10.25 g, 50.7 mmol) was dissolved in THF (127 ml) and the reaction mixture was cooled down to 0° C. Prop-1-yn-1-ylmagnesium bromide (0.5 M in THF, 304 ml, 152 mmol) was then added slowly (˜30 minutes) using an addition funnel and the mixture was allowed to warm up to room temperature overnight. The next day it was quenched by adding it to a stirring 0.5N HCl solution at 0° C. and extracted with DCM (3×). The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified with silica-gel chromatography (0-50% EtOAc in heptane) to afford the title compound as solid (7.22 g, 79% yield).
