DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS Embodiments of the invention are based, at least in part, on the discovery of a dry adhesive formed by mechanically interlocking a first plurality of substantially aligned fiber segments with a second plurality of substantially aligned fiber segments. In one or more embodiments, a first plurality of substantially aligned fibers comprises the first plurality of substantially aligned fiber segments and a second plurality of substantially aligned fibers comprises the second plurality of substantially aligned fiber segments. In one or more embodiments, a single plurality of substantially aligned fibers is provided, where the plurality has a first end region and a second end region, where the first end region and the second end region are mechanically interlocked. In one or more embodiments, a first plurality of aligned fibers is mechanically interlocked with a second plurality of aligned fibers. In certain advantageous embodiments, a dry adhesive is formed using a semi-batch or a continuous process. In one or more embodiments, the fibers are formed by an electrospinning process. A dry adhesive having substantially aligned polymeric nanofibers and one or more methods of making will now be described in greater detail. It should be noted that the specific materials and the specific process conditions disclosed in the following disclosures are given only as examples within the scope of the invention, and this invention should not be limited to these materials or process conditions as such. Referring now to FIG. 2, a first fiber mat, generally indicated by the numeral 12, includes a plurality of substantially aligned fibers 14 on a face stock 16. A second fiber mat, generally indicated by the numeral 18, includes a plurality of substantially aligned fibers 20 on a face stock 22. Although first fiber mat 12 and second fiber mat 18 are shown with face stock 16 and face stock 22, it should be appreciated that first fiber mat 12 and second fiber mat 18 can also be made only from substantially aligned fibers 14 and substantially aligned fibers 20, respectively. Face stock 16 and face stock 22 may be provided to give additional support to substantially aligned fibers 14 and substantially aligned fibers 20, respectively. To form mechanical interlocking between substantially aligned fibers 14 and substantially aligned fibers 20, first fiber mat 12 is brought into intimate contact with second fiber mat 18, as represented by arrow A. Referring now to FIG. 3, substantially aligned fibers 14 of first fiber mat 12 are mechanically interlocked with substantially aligned fibers 20 of second fiber mat 18. The mechanical interlock occurs at a mechanical interlock region, generally indicated by the numeral 24. It should be appreciated that FIG. 3 is not fully representative of mechanical interlocking as defined herein, because it does not show the fibers interlocked with a void space. It should be appreciated that FIG. 4 and FIG. 9 show schematic representations of mechanical interlock as defined herein. FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 are representative of one or more embodiments where a first plurality of fibers and a second plurality of fibers are brought together by mechanical interlocking. FIG. 4 is representative of one or more embodiments where a plurality of fibers has a first end region and a second end region, where the first end region and second end region are mechanically interlocked. For FIGS. 2-4, it can be said that a first plurality of fiber segments and a second plurality of fiber segments are mechanically interlocked. Referring now to FIG. 4, a fiber mat, generally indicated by the numeral 26, includes a plurality of substantially aligned fibers 28. In one or more embodiments, fiber mat 26 includes a face stock. In one or more embodiments, fiber mat 26 is devoid of a face stock. In one or more embodiments, fiber mat 26 consists only of substantially aligned fibers 28. Fiber mat 26 includes a first end region, generally indicated by the numeral 30, terminating at end 32, and a second end region, generally indicated by the numeral 34, terminating at end 36. Fiber mat 26 can then be manipulated, such as by wrapping around, to bring first end region 30 into intimate contact with second end region 34. This intimate contact allows the fibers of first end region 30 to enter the void spaces of second end region 34, and the fibers of second end region 34 to enter the void spaces of first end region 30, as to form a mechanical interlock region, generally indicated by the numeral 38. Opening, generally indicated by the numeral 40, formed by fiber mat 26 can contain one or more objects. Referring now to FIG. 9, a first fiber mat, generally indicated by the numeral 12′, includes a plurality of substantially aligned fibers 14′ having void spaces 15 therebetween. A second fiber mat, generally indicated by the numeral 18′, includes a plurality of substantially aligned fibers 20′ having void spaces 17 therebetween. To form mechanical interlocking between substantially aligned fibers 14′ and substantially aligned fibers 20′, first fiber mat 12′ is brought into intimate contact with second fiber mat 18′, as represented by the arrow provided. Substantially aligned fibers 14′ of first fiber mat 12′ are mechanically interlocked with substantially aligned fibers 20′ of second fiber mat 18′ based on substantially aligned fibers 14′ entering void spaces 17 between substantially aligned fibers 20′. Similarly, substantially aligned fibers 20′ enter void spaces 15 between substantially aligned fibers 14′. The mechanical interlock occurs at a mechanical interlock region, generally indicated by the numeral 24′. As used herein, dry adhesive or adhesion can be generally defined as attaching one substance to another substance. As used herein, adhesive or dry adhesive can be generally defined as attaching one substrate to another substrate, or as attaching one plurality of fiber segments or fibers with another plurality of fibers or fiber segments. As suggested herein, adhesion can be achieved by mechanical interlock, which can also be described as mechanical adhesion. The fibers described herein, which can also be referred to as aligned nanofibers, can be formed by electrospinning a spinnable liquid. Once received by an electrospinning collection surface, the fibers can also be described as an electrospun non-woven or a fiber mat. As will be further described below, viscoelastic properties of the fibers can be adjusted based on the use of various polymers, solvents, and additives. The viscoelasticity of the nanofibers can be finely tuned to enhance the intimate contacts between nanofibers and their derived mechanical interlocks. It should be appreciated that the use of the term alignment or substantially aligned is meant to describe the fibers as extending in a common direction. It should be appreciated that the alignment is general in nature and not absolutely perfect alignment as the collection of nanofibers on the collecting surface exhibiting a minute degree of instability. Thus, the alignment of nanofibers can also be referred to as being substantially aligned or generally aligned. Exemplary alignment is shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in FIG. 1. Electrospun fibers having general alignment exhibit significant improvement in adhesion strength compared to randomly orientated fiber mats, particularly those mats having a high degree of porosity. The porosity of a fiber mat provided herein is substantially reduced at least due to the alignment of the fibers. In one or more embodiments of the present invention, specific electrospinning apparatuses are used to encourage the formation of non-woven fabrics having aligned nanofibers. The nanofibers can be aligned using a rotating mandrel or a parallel electrodes collector. The rotating collector is typically cylindrically shaped, although any shapes known in the art can be utilized. The rotating mandrel can be a drum or a disc. The collected fibers tend to be drawn, stretched, and aligned in the direction of rotation. In one or more embodiments, a more helical winding of the nanofibers is achieved to create a non-woven with aligned fibers in a helical arrangement. It can be said that the nanofibers are aligned to be substantially parallel with other nanofibers. The collected fibers are understood as being aligned as opposed to randomly collected. The alignment of the fibers can be induced by a rotating drum where the degree of fiber alignment improves with the rotational speed. Randomly oriented fibers are obtained on the drum at take-up velocity (TUV) lower than the fiber TUV. At higher TUV, the fibers extend before being collected on the drum due to a centrifugal force which is developed on the surface of the rotating drum. Electrospinning is preferably employed to create non-woven fabrics of nanofibers that can serve as dry adhesives. Electrospinning processes are generally well known by those skilled in the art. It is preferred that syringe-less or nozzle-less electrospinning processes are used to form dry adhesives of the present invention. One or more aspects of an electrospinning process may be disclosed by U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,585,437; 8,157,554; 8,231,822; and 8,573,959, which are incorporated herein by reference. One or more aspects of an electrospinning process may be disclosed by PCT Publication No. WO 2014/025793, which is incorporated herein by reference, although certain embodiments of WO 2014/025793 disclose the use of a syringe or spinning nozzle, which is not preferred in the present invention. A syringe-less or nozzle-less electrospinning process can generally include a container for a polymer solution having at least one polymer solution inlet and at least one polymer solution outlet. The at least one polymer solution inlet and outlet serve to provide circulation of the polymer solution and to maintain the constant height of its level in the container. An air supply can be provided to supply air to the space between a charged electrode and a counter electrode. The charged electrode is partially immersed in the polymer solution. By rotating the charged electrode, the part of its circumference that is immersed in the polymer solution draws the polymer solution from the container into the space between the charged electrode and the counter electrode, where an electric field is formed. The nanofibers then form on the surface of the counter electrode support material. The formed nanofibers are attracted to the counter electrode based on the effects of the electric field, and consequently they are deposited on the surface of the counter electrode support material, such as a roller. The surface of the counter electrode support material can include a collection material thereon, such as a face stock, for receiving the nanofibers. The thickness of the layer of nanofibers can be controlled by maintaining the counter electrode support material in a collecting position for a predetermined time period. The thickness of the layer of nanofibers can also be controlled using the velocity of an associated reeling device and unreeling device. Referring now to FIG. 5, an electrospinning apparatus for creating non-woven fabrics with aligned nanofibers is shown and designated by the numeral 50. Apparatus 50 includes a container 52 holding a spinnable solution 54 for electrospinning. A roller 56 comprises a charged electrode and is partially immersed in spinnable solution 54. Roller 56 can include a multitude of protrusions (not shown), which can become coated with spinnable solution 54. A second roller 58 comprises a counter electrode and is positioned proximate to roller 56. Second roller 58 provides a peripheral collecting surface 60 that can have a face stock positioned therearound. Second roller 58 can be provided as a drum collector, where the designation as a drum collector typically relates to the collector having a collecting surface that is of a more substantial axial length, whereas designation as a disc collector typically relates to the collector having a very narrow collecting surface, i.e., a more sharp edge. Roller 56 comprising the charged electrode is allowed to rotate, as indicated by the provided arrow, such that the portion of its circumference that is immersed in spinnable solution 54 is able to draw spinnable solution 54 from container 52. Upon rotation of roller 56, spinnable solution 54 is drawn into a space between the charged electrode and the counter electrode, that is, between roller 56 and second roller 58, where an electric field is formed. The formed nanofibers are attracted to the counter electrode based on the effects of the electric field, and consequently they are deposited on surface 60 of second roller 58. Second roller 58 is also rotatable, as indicated by the provided arrow, as to allow multiple layers of nanofibers to be collected thereon. Surface 60 of second roller 58 can include a collection material thereon, such as a face stock, for receiving the nanofibers. The thickness of the layer of nanofibers can be controlled by allowing the electrospinning to occur for a predetermined time period or for a predetermined amount of rotations of second roller 58. Roller 56 and second roller 58 can rotate either in the same direction or in opposite directions. Fiber alignment can be improved if roller 56 and second roller 58 rotate in the same direction. Roller 56 and second roller 58 can be rotated by any known methods in the art, such as by attachment to a motor. Based on the above, it should be appreciated that the apparatus in FIG. 5 operates as a generally batch process. Referring now to FIG. 6, an electrospinning apparatus for creating non-woven fabrics with aligned nanofibers is shown and designated by the numeral 70. Apparatus 70 includes a container 72 holding a spinnable solution 74 for electrospinning. An internal roller 76 comprises a charged electrode and is partially immersed in a spinnable solution 74. Internal roller 76 can include a multitude of protrusions (not shown), which can become coated with spinnable solution 74. Apparatus 70 includes a plurality of external rollers 78, 80, 81, each comprising a counter electrode. External rollers 78, 80, 81 are coupled as by way of wheel 82. Wheel 82 is rotatable, as indicated by the provided arrow, as to move external rollers 78, 80 to various positions. Wheel 82 may also be described as wheel-type frame 82. External rollers 78, 80, 81 may be positioned equidistant with each other. That is, external roller 78 may be positioned equidistant from external roller 80 and external roller 81. Where four external rollers are utilized, the four external rollers may be positioned equidistant from each other. An external roller in the position of external roller 78 receives a face stock 84 from a roll 86. Roll 86 can rotate to dispense face stock 84 and external roller 78 can rotate to receive face stock 84. It can be said that roll 86 conveys face stock 84 to external roller 78. Once roller 78 has received sufficient face stock 84, cutting device 88 can cut the face stock 84. Cutting device 88 can be any known device for cutting or severing a face stock. After roller 78 receives a predetermined amount of face stock 84, it is allowed to rotate to the position of external roller 81. Once in that position, internal roller 76 is allowed to rotate, such that the portion of its circumference that is immersed in polymer solution 74 is able to draw polymer solution 74 from container 72. Upon rotation of roller 76, polymer solution 74 is drawn into a space between the charged electrode and the counter electrode, that is, between roller 76 and external roller 81, where an electric field is formed. The formed nanofibers are attracted to the counter electrode based on the effects of the electric field, and consequently they are deposited on the surface of the roller positioned as at external roller 81. External roller 81 is also rotatable as to allow multiple layers of nanofibers to be collected thereon. The surface of external roller 81 includes face stock 84 as a collection material for receiving the nanofibers. The thickness of the layer of nanofibers can be controlled by allowing the electrospinning to occur for a predetermined time period or for a predetermined amount of rotations of external roller 81. External rollers 78, 80, and 81 can rotate either in the direction of the rotation of internal roller 76 or in the opposite direction of the rotation of internal roller 76. As suggested above, fiber alignment can be improved if external rollers 78, 80, and 81 rotate in the same direction as internal roller 76. Once electrospinning has been allowed to occur for a predetermined time period, external roller 81 is allowed to rotate to the position of external roller 80. At this point of the process, external roller 81 comprises a fiber mat 90 having substantially aligned fibers 92. Once at the position of external roller 80, external roller 80 is allowed to rotate as to collect fiber mat 90. External roller 80 can rotate to dispense fiber mat 90 and roll 94 can rotate to receive fiber mat 90. It can be said that roll 94 conveys fiber mat 90 having substantially aligned fibers 92 to roll 94. Once roller 80 has dispensed all of fiber mat 90, wheel 82 and external rollers are allowed to move to the next position. External rollers 78, 80, 81 can be provided as drum collectors, where the designation as drum collectors typically relates to the collectors having a collecting surface that is of a more substantial axial length, whereas designation as disc collectors typically relates to the collector having a very narrow collecting surface, i.e., a more sharp edge. Based on the above, it should be appreciated that the apparatus in FIG. 6 can be said to operate as a generally semi-batch process on the basis that the external rollers move to, and remain at, discrete positions. It should also be appreciated that the apparatus in FIG. 6 can be said to operate as a generally continuous and roll-to-roll process on the basis that it can continuously make fiber mat product. Such an apparatus and process may be scaled, such as including more external rollers, or differing configurations, as to make the process even more continuous and roll-to-roll. Referring now to FIG. 8, an electrospinning apparatus for creating non-woven fabrics with aligned nanofibers is shown and designated by the numeral 100. The apparatus 100 includes a dispenser 102 holding a spinnable solution for electrospinning. A roll 104 comprises a face stock 106 that moves underneath dispenser 102. Roll 104 can rotate to dispense face stock 106. Apparatus 100 includes a charged electrode and a ground electrode such that dispenser 102 can electrospin nanofibers onto face stock 106 as it moves underneath dispenser 102. In one or more embodiments, dispenser 102 comprises a charged electrode and a ground electrode is positioned below or on face stock 106. In one or more embodiments, a charged electrode and a ground electrode are positioned below or on a conveyer belt. The electrospun nanofibers form as aligned fibers 108 to form fiber mat 110. Fiber mat 110 can be collected by a roll 112, as by roll 112 rotating to collect fiber mat 110. Further details of such roll to roll processes are known to those skilled in the art. Based on the above, it should be appreciated that the apparatus in FIG. 8 operates as a generally continuous process. As described above, nanofibers are formed by electrospinning a spinnable liquid. The spinnable liquid can also be described as a spinnable polymer solution or a spinnable solution. In one or more embodiments, the spinnable liquid is polymeric. Most polymers can be dissolved in suitably selected solvents. In one or more embodiments, the spinnable liquid is a polymer solution comprising a highly spinnable polymer carried in an appropriate solvent at an overall viscosity suitable for electrospinning. In one or more embodiments, the spinnable polymer can be selected from polyurethanes (PU), polycaprolactones (PCL), polyvinyl alcohols (PVA), poly(vinyldiene fluoride)s (PVDF), polyamides (PA), polybenzimidazoles (PBI), polycarbonates (PC), polyacrylonitriles (PAN), polylactic acids (PLA), polyethylene oxides (PEO) and polyethylene glycols (PEG), polyethylene terephthalates (PET), polystyrenes (PS), polyvinylphenols (PVP), polyvinylchlorides (PVC), cellulose acetates (CA), polyether imides (PEI), poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane)s (PFDMS), polyvinylpyrrolidone, polytetrafluoroethylene, polynorbornene, polysulfone, polyether ether ketone, polyacrylates including poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (PHEMA), poly(glycidyl methacrylate), poly(2-dimethylamino ethylmethacrylate) (PDMAEMA), poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine), polyacrylamides including poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and poly(N, N-dimethyl acrylamide) (PDMA), and mixtures thereof. Thus, in one or more embodiments, the spinnable liquid is a polymer solution formed from one or more polymers dissolved in one or more solvents. The particular one or more polymers and one or more solvents can be chosen based on the corresponding properties. In one or more embodiments, two or more solvents are used in the spinnable liquid to produce synergistic effects. Suitable solvents will be appreciated as being useful for particular polymers. In accordance with the list of polymers provided herein, suitable solvents can be chosen from toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CHCl3), alcohols including methanol, ethanol, and propanol, dimethylacetamide (DMAC), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), 2-butanone, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, xylene, acetone, formic acid, distilled water, trifluoracetic acid, hexafluoro-2-propanol, ionic liquids, and mixtures thereof. In one or more embodiments, the polymer or polymers are present in the polymer solution at a concentration suitable for providing acceptable solution properties, such as viscosity, conductivity, and surface tension, suitable for successful electrospinning. The molecular weight and molecular weight distribution and architecture of the polymer can also be varied to achieve a desired electrospinning. In one or more embodiments, the polymer or polymers are present in the polymer solution at a percentage of from 1 wt % or more to 30 wt % or less. In one or more embodiments, the polymer or polymers are present in the polymer solution at a concentration of from 3 wt % or more to 25 wt % or less, in other embodiments, from 5 wt % or more to 20 wt % or less. The viscosity of the solution influences its spinnability. Controlling the viscosity of a solution is generally known in the art. A solution that is too viscous, and a solution that is not viscous enough, cannot be spun. In some embodiments, the highly spinnable solution can be selected from one or more of the following: (i) nylon 6,6 dissolved in formic acid with a concentration of 5-20 wt %; (ii) polyurethanes dissolved in dimethyl formamide with a concentration of 5-20 wt %; (iii) polybenzimidazole (PBI) dissolved in dimethyl accetamide with a concentration of 5-10 wt. %; (iv) polycarbonate dissolved in dimethyl formamide:tetrahydrofuran with a concentration of 5-10 wt. %; (v) polycarbonate dissolved in dichloromethane with a concentration of 5-20 wt. %; (vi) polyacrylonitrile (PAN) dissolved in dimethyl formamide with a concentration of 5-20 wt. %; (vii) polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) dissolved in distilled water with a concentration of 1-16 wt. %; (viii) polylactic acid (PLA) dissolved in dichloromethane with a concentration of 1-15 wt %; (ix) polyethylene oxide (PEO) dissolved in distilled water with a concentration of 4-10 wt %; (x) polyethylene terephthalate (PET) dissolved in dichloromethane and trifluoracetic acid with a 12-18 wt %; (xi) polystyrene (PS) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran with a concentration of 1-25 wt % (xi) polyvinyl phenol (PVP) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran with a concentration of 20-60% (wt./vol.); (xii) polyvinylchloride (PVC) dissolved in mixture of tetrahydrofuran and dimethylformamide with 10-15 wt %; (xiii) cellulose acetate, CA dissolved in acetone and acetic acid, dimethylacetamide; with concentration of 12.5-20%; (xiv) poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) dissolved in mixture of dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide with a concentration of 20 wt. %; (xv) polyether imide (PEI) dissolved in hexafluoro-2-propanol with a concentration of 10 wt. %; (xvi) polyethylene glycol (PEG) dissolved in chloroform with a concentration of 0.5-30 wt % poly(ferrocenyldimethylsilane); and (xvii) PFDMS dissolved in tetrahydrofuran and dimethylformamide with a concentration of 5-30 wt. %. The dielectric properties of a solvent can be controlled as desired for better dry adhesive properties. In one or more embodiments, the spinnable liquid is combined with an adhesive component to further enhance the adhesion properties. In one or more embodiments, the non-woven is electrospun form a polymer solution including a small amount of low modulus adhesive component. The adhesive component can be chosen to provide selected adhesion capability in certain embodiments. The adhesive component can impact the intermolecular interactions such as van der Waals forces, such that these interactions are further augmented by the adhesive nature of the low modulus viscous component and its dielectric properties. The adhesive component is broadly a viscoelastic and/or a resin-curable component. In some embodiments, the low modulus viscous component is flowable at room temperature. In one or more embodiments, the adhesive component has a Young's modulus of less than 0.1 GPA (gigapascal). In other embodiments, the adhesive component has a Young's modulus of 0.1 GPA or less, in other embodiments 0.075 GPA or less, in other embodiments 0.05 GPA or less, in other embodiments 0.03 GPA or less, in other embodiments 0.02 GPA or less, in other embodiments 0.01 GPA or less, in other embodiments 0.005 GPA or less, in other embodiments 0.001 GPA or less. In embodiments comprising an adhesive polymeric component, the adhesive polymeric component can be added in order to improve the shear adhesion of the resulting non-woven. The adhesive properties of electrospun fibers can be finely tuned by solution blending techniques that are well known in the art. In one or more embodiments, the adhesive component is polyisobutylene. Polyisobutylene, which can also be referred to as “PIB” or (C4H8)n, is the homopolymer of isobutylene, or 2-methyl-1-propene, on which butyl rubber is based. Structurally, polyisobutylene resembles polypropylene, having two methyl groups substituted on every other carbon atom. In one or more embodiments, an electrospinnable liquid solution includes a tackifier. Tackifiers are chemical compounds that can be used in formulating adhesives to increase the tack, the wettability between an adhesive and a substrate, and the stickiness of the surface of an adhesive. They are generally low-molecular weight compounds with glass transition temperature above room temperature. At low strain rate, they provide higher stress compliance, and become stiffer at higher strain rates. Tackifiers are generally resins (e.g. rosins and their derivatives, terpenes and modified terpenes, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic resins (C5 aliphatic resins, C9 aromatic resins, and C5/C9 aliphatic/aromatic resins), hydrogenated hydrocarbon resins, and their mixtures, terpene-phenol resins (TPR, used often with ethylene-vinyl acetate adhesives)). A tackifier can be dissolved in a solvent including DCM, toluene, THF, and DMAC prior to electrospinning and therefore integrated with the spinnable material. In one or more embodiments, the adhesive component is cyanoacrylate or polyacrylate. In one or more embodiments, the adhesive component is present in an amount from 1 wt % or more to 5 wt % or less, based upon the total weight of the spinnable material. The content should be low enough as to not interfere with the spinnability of the major component as a solution for electrospinning. The adhesive component, when present, is blended in the spinnable material solution prior to electrospinning. The spinnable material is used as a carrier for the adhesive component. Based on the above, the stickiness, dryness and tackiness can be fine tuned during the solution blending process. In one or more embodiments, the spinnable liquid is devoid of an additional adhesive component. In one or more embodiments, a non-woven has an adhesion energy of 200 mJ/m2 or higher. In other embodiments, a non-woven has an adhesion energy of 300 mJ/m2 or higher. In one or more embodiments, a non-woven has a shear adhesion strength of 40 N/cm2 or higher. In one or more embodiments, a non-woven has a shear adhesion strength of 45 N/cm2 or higher. In other embodiments, a non-woven has a shear adhesion strength of 50 N/cm2 or higher. In other embodiments, a non-woven has a shear adhesion strength of 55 N/cm2 or higher. In other embodiments, a non-woven has a shear adhesion strength of 60 N/cm2 or higher. In one or more embodiments, a non-woven has a shear adhesion strength greater than the tear strength of a face stock that the non-woven is positioned on. This is evident when, during testing, the face stock exhibits a failure, such as tearing, before the non-woven reaches a point of failure. The suitable adhesive component could be dissolved in the same solvents which are used to dissolve the spinnable polymer. Solvents that are particularly beneficial for dissolving adhesive components include toluene, THF, DCM, chloroform, methanol, DMAC, DMSO, DMF, and xylene. Certain properties of the nanofibers can be controlled in order to tailor the adhesion strength. These properties include fiber diameter (d) and fiber surface roughness. The properties of a non-woven that is formed from the nanofibers can also be controlled in order to tailor the adhesion strength. These properties include bending stiffness (b), non-woven thickness (T), loading angle, and molecular orientation. The properties of both the fibers and the fiber mats can have an effect on the adhesion strength and friction coefficient (μ) of the fiber mats. Generally, as the fiber diameter decreases, the bending moment and thus bending stiffness decrease. Similarly, as the fiber diameter increases, the bending moment and thus bending stiffness increase. The bending stiffness of the non-woven critically influences the shear adhesion strength measured. In a method including utilizing a rotating drum collector, the diameter of the nanofiber can be controlled through the take-up velocity (TUV) of the drum. In one or more embodiments, the fiber diameter is less than or equal to 10 microns. In other embodiments, the fiber diameter is less than or equal to 1 microns, in other embodiments, the fiber diameter is less than or equal to 500 nanometers, in other embodiments, the fiber diameter is less than or equal to 100 nanometers, and in other embodiments, the fiber diameter is less than or equal to 50 nanometers. In one or more embodiments, the fiber diameter is from 50 nanometers or more to 1000 nanometers or less. In one or more embodiments, the fiber diameter is from 50 nanometers or more to 500 nanometers or less. Electrospinning a spinnable solution, as disclosed herein, yields non-woven fabrics of aligned nanofibers. As suggested above, the non-woven fabric can also be described as a plurality of fibers, a plurality of fiber segments, a fiber array, or a fiber mat. The surfaces of the non-woven fabric are defined by many generally aligned nanofibers, as generally seen in the image of FIG. 1. The nanofibers, being of such nanoscopic diameters, are able to be received in the mating space of another group of nanofibers. The aligned nanofibers possess great flexibility, which allows the fibers to conform to the mating space. Thus, the non-woven can serve as a dry adhesive. In one or more embodiments, the non-woven can be wrapped around an object for securing the object. Where two pluralities of fibers are joined, the architecture of the first non-woven and the fibers thereof should be tailored to be comparable to the dimensions of the second non-woven and the fibers thereof. That is, the sizes of the fibers of the first non-woven should be such that they fit in the void spaces of the second non-woven. The thickness of a non-woven or fiber mat might be optimized for a given application. In one or more embodiments, the thickness of a non-woven is from 1 micrometer or more to 1 millimeter or less. In other embodiments, the thickness of a non-woven is from 1 micrometer or more to 10 micrometers or less, in other embodiments, from 0.1 micrometers or more to 1 micrometer or less. In one or more embodiments, the thickness of a non-woven is less than 2 millimeters. A fiber mat of the present invention generally has higher shear adhesion while also having generally lower normal adhesion strength. Shear adhesion is the adhesion strength measured in a direction that is coplanar with a cross section of the material, in other words, the adhesion strength measured in a direction that is generally parallel to the surface of the material. Normal adhesion strength, or normal lifting force, is the adhesion strength measured in a direction that is generally perpendicular with the surface of the material. A large difference between shear adhesion and normal adhesion is desired in order to easily switch between attachment of the adhesive and detachment. This property of the fiber mat allows the fiber mat to be removable, repositionable, and reusable. That is, the fiber mat can be attached and detached a number of times without failure and without residue being left on an adherend surface. In one or more embodiments, a fiber mat has a shear adhesion strength that is at least 500% higher than normal adhesion strength. In one or more embodiments, a fiber mat has a shear adhesion strength that is 1000% or more higher than normal adhesion strength. In one or more embodiments, a fiber mat has a shear adhesion strength that is 2000% or more higher than normal adhesion strength. In one or more embodiments, a fiber mat has a shear adhesion strength that is at least 3000% higher than normal adhesion strength. A fiber mat or dry adhesive as provided herein can be characterized by the quantified alignment of the fibers thereof. Such quantification can be the angle that the fibers extend through, a distribution calculation of the amount of fibers that are aligned using the angular power spectrum, percentage of alignment, also referred to as the density of alignment, and surface area coverage of a face stock. A fiber mat or dry adhesive as provided herein can be characterized by the angle at which the fibers extend. For a reference point, a fiber extending parallel with the direction of extension is considered to be extending at 90 degrees. It can also be said that the reference angle of 90 degrees is the direction of formation when electrospun fibers are applied to a surface, such as a roller or conveyer. In one or more embodiments, substantially all of the fibers extend at angles between 80 degree and 100 degrees. In one or more embodiments, at least 90 percent of the fibers extend at angles between 80 degrees and 100 degrees. In one or more embodiments, at least 80 percent of the fibers extend at angles between 80 degrees and 100 degrees. In one or more embodiments, substantially all of the fibers extend at angles between 85 degree and 95 degrees. In one or more embodiments, at least 90 percent of the fibers extend at angles between 85 degrees and 95 degrees. In one or more embodiments, at least 80 percent of the fibers extend at angles between 85 degrees and 95 degrees. A fiber mat or dry adhesive as provided herein can be characterized by the degree of alignment of the fibers using 2-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D FFT) analysis of SEM images. 2D FFT provides a reliable and straightforward way to measure fiber alignment in electrospun fibers. 2D FFT has been used widely accepted as a standard method for evaluating alignment. A FFT frequency distribution constructs a plot of normalized intensity versus alignment angle. It can be said that an FFT analysis of a data image containing randomly aligned fibers generates an output image containing pixels distributed in a symmetrical, circular shape. This distribution occurs because the frequency at which specific pixel intensities occur in the data image is theoretically identical in any direction. In contrast, the FFT analysis of a data image containing aligned fibers results in an output image containing pixels distributed in a non-random, elliptical distribution. This distribution occurs because the pixel intensities are preferentially distributed with a specific orientation. Further information regarding FFT analysis is disclosed in the reference article “Modulation of anisotropy in electrospun tissue-engineering scaffolds: Analysis of fiber alignment by the fast Fourier transform” by Ayres et al. from Biomaterials Nov. 2006 (Online Jul. 21, 2006), which is incorporated herein by reference. This quantification results in a distribution graph where the angle of alignment is the x-axis and the normalized intensity (frequency) is the y-axis. In one or more embodiments, the distribution graph includes a frequency peak at 90 degrees of at least 0.40. In one or more embodiments, the distribution graph includes a frequency peak at 90 degrees of at least 0.70. In one or more embodiments, the distribution graph includes a frequency peak at 90 degrees of at least 0.80. Furthermore, the sharpness of the frequency peak at 90 degrees is representative of the uniformity of alignment. The sharper the peak at 90 degrees, the more area occupied between the specific degree range under the frequency peak. In one or more embodiments, the distribution graph includes at least 70 percent of the area under the curve between the angles of 80 degrees and 100 degrees. In one or more embodiments, the distribution graph includes at least 85 percent of the area under the curve between the angles of 80 degrees and 100 degrees. In one or more embodiments, the distribution graph includes at least 90 percent of the area under the curve between the angles of 80 degrees and 100 degrees. In one or more embodiments, the distribution graph includes at least 70 percent of the area under the curve between the angles of 85 degrees and 95 degrees. In one or more embodiments, the distribution graph includes at least 85 percent of the area under the curve between the angles of 85 degrees and 95 degrees. In one or more embodiments, the distribution graph includes at least 90 percent of the area under the curve between the angles of 85 degrees and 95 degrees. A fiber mat or dry adhesive as provided herein can be characterized by the percentage of fibers that are substantially aligned. The percentage of fibers that are substantially aligned can also be referred to as the density of alignment. In one or more embodiments, substantially all of the fibers are substantially aligned. In one or more embodiments, at least 98 percent of the fibers are substantially aligned. In one or more embodiments, at least 95 percent of the fibers are substantially aligned. In one or more embodiments, at least 85 percent of the fibers are substantially aligned. In one or more embodiments, at least 70 percent of the fibers are substantially aligned. Where a fiber mat or dry adhesive as provided herein includes a face stock, the fiber mat or dry adhesive can be characterized by the surface area coverage of the fiber mat or dry adhesive when compared to the face stock. That is, if the surface area of the face stock is taken as a 100 percent reference point, the percentage of that 100 percent reference point being covered by a fiber mat or dry adhesive can be said to be the surface area coverage. In one or more embodiments, the surface area coverage of a face stock by a fiber mat or dry adhesive is 100 percent or approximate thereto. In one or more embodiments, the surface area coverage of a face stock by a fiber mat or dry adhesive is at least 95 percent. In one or more embodiments, the surface area coverage of a face stock by a fiber mat or dry adhesive is at least 85 percent. In one or more embodiments, the surface area coverage of a face stock by a fiber mat or dry adhesive is at least 80 percent. In one or more embodiments, the surface area coverage of a face stock by a fiber mat or dry adhesive is at least 70 percent. The fiber properties described herein can be measured using digital image processing techniques as are known to those skilled in the art. An exemplary digital image processing technique includes the use of the Fourier power spectrum method. An exemplary software utilizing a digital image processing technique is the ImageJ software from National Institutes of Health. The nanofibers and fiber mat formed therefrom may also be characterized by the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the one or more polymeric materials used to make the nanofibers. The glass transition temperature can be described as the reversible transition in amorphous materials from a hard and relatively brittle state into a molten or rubber-like state. It can also be said that materials having a lower glass transition temperature are generally more “wet.” Generally, forming a fiber mat from a polymeric material that is less “wet” will give the fiber mat improved reusability properties. Generally, forming a fiber mat from a polymeric material that is more “wet” will give the fiber mat improved intimate contacts due to flow. These properties can be balanced based on the desired application. In one or more embodiments, the one or more polymeric materials used to make the nanofibers has a glass transition temperature less than ambient temperature. In one or more embodiments, the one or more polymeric materials used to make the nanofibers has a glass transition temperature greater than ambient temperature. It can be said that a polymer with a glass transition temperature less than ambient temperature is considered to behave in liquid state at room temperature. It can be said that a polymer with a glass transition temperature higher than ambient temperature is considered to behave in solid state at room temperature. As used herein, mechanical interlock is defined as fiber segments or fibers entering the void space between other fiber segments or fibers. The void space can also be referred to as mating space, as the fiber segments or fibers are matingly received in the mating space and held together. It can also be said that the fiber segments or fibers are mutually complementary with the void space. For example, a first plurality of fibers can include void spaces between the fibers. To form a mechanical interlock, at least a portion of a second plurality of fibers is allowed to enter the void spaces between the fibers of the first plurality of fibers. A general schematic of mechanical interlocking is provided in FIG. 9, although it should be appreciated that in the nanofiber scale, the first plurality of fiber segments or fibers is in immediate proximity with the second plurality of fiber segments or fibers upon becoming mechanically interlocked. The mechanical action of the mechanical interlock described herein can be said to be similar to hook and loop fasteners, such as Velcro™. As such, a dry adhesive as described herein can be used in similar applications as hook and loop fasteners. However, fiber mats described herein offer one or more improvements over such hook and loop fasteners, such as improved reusability. The intimate contact between the two pluralities of nanofibers can be maximized by three factors: (i) improved alignment of nanofibers, (ii) higher surface area based on the nanoscale size of the fibers, and (iii) increased flexibility of the nanofibers, allowing the nanofibers to be easily conformable. As such, the strength of the interlocks can be increased by choosing viscoelastic polymers and their derivatives as the base materials for forming the nanofibers. Mechanical interlocking can also be defined as the first plurality of fiber segments or fibers having nano-scale protrusions extending from the first plurality. The second plurality of fiber segments or fibers can be said to have nano-scale void spaces within the second plurality. Based on this definition of mechanical interlocking, a mechanical interlock is formed by the nano-scale protrusions filling nano-scale void spaces. Referring now to FIG. 10, a cross-sectional schematic representation of mechanical interlocking is represented. A first fiber mat, generally indicated by the numeral 12″, includes a plurality of substantially aligned fibers 14″ having void spaces 15″ therebetween. A second fiber mat, generally indicated by the numeral 18″, includes a plurality of substantially aligned fibers 20″ having void spaces 17″ therebetween. To form mechanical interlocking between substantially aligned fibers 14″ and substantially aligned fibers 20″, first fiber mat 12″ is brought into intimate contact with second fiber mat 18″. Substantially aligned fibers 14″ of first fiber mat 12″ are mechanically interlocked with substantially aligned fibers 20″ of second fiber mat 18″ based on substantially aligned fibers 14″ entering void spaces 17″ between substantially aligned fibers 20″. Similarly, substantially aligned fibers 20″ enter void spaces 15″ between substantially aligned fibers 14″. The mechanical interlock occurs at a mechanical interlock region, generally indicated by the numeral 24″. Where one or more face stocks are described herein, suitable face stocks can include metal substrates, aluminum foil, polymer films, polyethylene terephthalate films, woven polyester fibers, paper materials, laminates, and carbon fibers. In one or more embodiments, a dry adhesive includes a release liner. In one or more embodiments, a desired face stock is chosen based on the polymer that is used to make the nanofibers. Referring now to FIG. 7, an applicator for applying a dry adhesive is shown and generally designated by the numeral 120. Applicator 120 includes a handle 122 with a main arm 124 extending therefrom. Main arm 124 terminates at an end, where two holder arms 126 extend therefrom in a horseshoe-type shape. A distal end of each holder arm 126 is coupled to an internal roller 128 that carries a fiber mat roll 130 therearound. An applicator arm 132 extends from a middle portion of main arm 124. A distal end of applicator arm 132 carries an applicator, generally indicated by the numeral 134. Applicator 134 comprises an applicator roll 136. Fiber mat roll 130 comprises a length of fiber mat rolled on itself as to form a cylinder having a central hole therethrough. The central hole receives roller 128 as to position fiber mat roll 130 in applicator 120. Fiber mat roll 130 has a fiber mat application portion 138 extending therefrom and to applicator 134. Fiber mat application portion 138 extends underneath applicator roll 136 in order to be applied to the surface of a substrate. Advantageously, applicator roll 136 can be used to press fiber mat application portion 138 against the surface of a substrate, where the fiber mat application portion 138 will stick for reasons described herein and in PCT Publication No. WO 2014/025793, which is incorporated herein by reference. Applicator roll 136 can also be said to be used for removing air from the fiber mat application portion 138 upon being applied to the surface of a substrate. In one or more embodiments, fiber mat roll 130 comprises a release substrate (not shown) that is peeled from fiber mat application portion 138 before applying fiber mat application portion 138 to the surface of a substrate. Once all of a fiber mat roll 130 has been applied, a new fiber mat roll 130 can be supplied to applicator 120. Another exemplary applicator is a laminating knife as known by those skilled in the art. As suggested above, a function of an applicator is to rub out air trapped in between nanofibers, enhancing the intimate contacts between the mating faces. This is an improvement over randomly orientated fiber mats, where it is difficult or not possible to remove the air. The trapped air can then cause cracks and delamination of the adhesive from the adherend. In one or more embodiments, a dry adhesive can be said to be airtight. A dry adhesive formed as described herein may be useful in household applications, biomedical applications, aerospace applications, microelectronic fabrication, wafer fabrication, coatings, advertising, films or labels, robotics applications, textiles and apparels, automotive applications, and as adhesives. A dry adhesive may be used as a high temperature adhesive, where polymers capable of withstanding high temperature are utilized. Based on the mechanism of the mechanical interlock described herein, a dry adhesive as described herein can be used underwater and in aqueous environments. The mechanical interlock remains secured even in these environments. A method of securing a first substrate with a second substrate can include first steps of providing a first substrate having a plurality of substantially aligned fiber segments having void spaces therebetween and providing a second substrate having a plurality of substantially aligned fiber segments having void spaces therebetween. The pluralities of substantially aligned fiber segments can de directly applied to the first substrate and the second substrate. The substantially aligned fiber segments of the first substrate are allowed to become intimately positioned with the void spaces of the second substrate. The substantially aligned fiber segments of the second substrate are allowed to become intimately positioned with the void spaces of the first substrate. This forms a mechanical interlock utilizing the fiber segments of the first substrate and the fiber segments of the second substrate. The air can be removed, as by pressing or rolling out the air, as to further secure the mechanical interlock. In light of the foregoing, it should be appreciated that the present invention significantly advances the art by providing improved dry adhesives and associated methods of manufacture and use. While particular embodiments of the invention have been disclosed in detail herein, it should be appreciated that the invention is not limited thereto or thereby inasmuch as variations on the invention herein will be readily appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. The scope of the invention shall be appreciated from the claims that follow.
