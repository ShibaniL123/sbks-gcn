Step 4
2-(3,5-Dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)ethyl methanesulfonate
2-(3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)ethanol (100 mg, 0.708 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (3 mL), and triethylamine (143 mg, 1.42 mmol) and methanesulfonyl chloride (79.3 mg, 0.708 mmol) were added at 0°C. The reaction solution was reacted at 25°C for 2 hours, and then quenched by adding sodium bicarbonate saturated aqueous solution (10 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (10 mL x 3). The organic phases were combined, washed with saturated sodium chloride solution (10 mL x 3), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give 2-(3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)ethyl methanesulfonate (100 mg, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 64%.
