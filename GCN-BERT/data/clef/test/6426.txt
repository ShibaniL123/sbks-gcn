Step 2: Preparation of (S)-7-amino-5-(1-(8-chloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethylamino)pyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one
60 mg of (S)-7-amino-5-(1-(8-chloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethylamino)pyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one was prepared as a white solid by using 170 mg (0.346 mmol) of (S)-5-(1-(8-chloro-1-oxo-2-phenyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-3-yl)ethylamino)-7-(methylthio)pyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one prepared in step 2 according to the same manner as described in step 4 of Example 15 (yield: 38%).
