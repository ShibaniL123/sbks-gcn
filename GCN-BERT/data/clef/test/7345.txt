Reference Example B-5: Synthesis of 1-(furo[3,2-c]pyridin-2-ylsulfonylamino)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (B-5)
(step 1) Synthesis of 4-chlorofuro[3,2-c]pyridine-2-sulfonyl chloride
A solution of 4-chlorofuro[3,2-c]pyridine (3.0 g, 20 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (80 mL) was cooled to -40째C, 2.5 mol/L n-butyllithium (hexane solution, 9.4 mL, 24 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred for 1 hr. Sulfur dioxide was blown into the reaction mixture for 30 min while maintaining the temperature at -40째C to -30째C, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hr. To the reaction mixture was added hexane (100 mL), and the insoluble material was collected by filtration, and dried. To the obtained solid was added dichloromethane (75 mL) and N-chlorosuccinimide (3.1 g, 23 mmol) was added at 0째C, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. The reaction mixture was washed 5 times with water. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate, the desiccant was filtered off, and the solvent was evaporated to give the title compound (3.5 g, 14 mmol, 71%).
