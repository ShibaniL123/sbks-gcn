Plant support system The present invention relates to an apparatus for plant support, in particular to the support of plants used in horticulture. Plants used in horticulture often require support in order to encourage upright growth and to prevent damage to the stems or shoots, for example during windy conditions. This is particularly the case for plants which grow to a significant height, for example to a height of one metre or more, and those that produce hanging ripening produce, such as cordon tomatoes. Methods for plant support known in the art include the use of stakes, wires or other elements which are used in combination with ties which are used to tether the stems or shoots to the support elements. The use of ties to tether plants has a number of drawbacks. The ties may restrict plant stem development and can be a cause of damage to delicate plant stems and side shoots through chafing and tearing, and even breaking of the stem. The positioning and repositioning of stakes adjacent to a plant can also lead to root damage and the roots may need to divert to circumvent the obstruction caused. In addition as a plant develops, and in order to avoid restriction of stem growth, the ties are often required to be loosened and retied or cut and replaced. This requires handling of the plant and is time consuming and difficult for some, for example those with reduced finger dexterity. Furthermore, current systems of ties and support elements are not constructed to, and thus not able to, to support the weight of hanging produce. There is a need for systems which provide alternative means for plant support with reduced likelihood of damage to stems or side shoots, which are easily and rapidly adjustable, and support the weight of hanging produce. Such systems would reduce the energy required for plants to respond to damage and restriction caused by human intervention and would contribute beneficially to yield and quality of produce. Accordingly there is provided an apparatus for plant support which comprises at least two upright elements, one or more bracing bars positioned between two upright elements, and at least one additional support means attached to at least one bracing bar, wherein, in use, the one or more bracing bars provide support for the stem of at least one plant, and the position of the additional support means is adjustable along the length of the bracing bar. The apparatus is suitable for providing support for plant stems, side shoots and plant produce. Preferably at least one of said bracing bars comprises a pair of bracing bars which, in use, provide support on opposite sides of the stem of at least one plant. More preferably, each pair of bracing bars is substantially parallel. The apparatus as described herein provides support for plants, especially those of a height up to one metre or more, both at the stem and also beneath side shoots and trusses. The apparatus maintains plant stems substantially vertical and provides support without the use of ties and / or stakes. This enables a reduction in the number of stem breakages and reduces the damage to plants from the ties themselves and from the handling of the plants during adjustment of the ties. In addition, there is no requirement to position a stake other support next to the roots of the plants. Preferably, the one or more bracing bars are substantially horizontal. The apparatus described herein may be used to support plants collectively or individually. An advantage of the claimed invention is that the apparatus is reusable and readily adaptable depending on the horticultural requirements. For example, it will be apparent to the skilled person that the length of the bracing bars may be selected depending on the number of plants to be cultivated. In addition, the height of the upright elements and the vertical position of the bracing bars are easily adjustable depending on the height of the plants. The apparatus may also be extended by introducing additional upright elements, bracer struts and bracing bars. Preferably, in use, the additional support means provide support for the stem of at least one plant in a direction perpendicular to the support provided by the one or more bracing bars. The apparatus described herein therefore enables support of a plant on several sides without the use of ties and this support is easily adjustable in perpendicular directions. The additional support means may comprise a plate or tray which is held substantially horizontal and which helps to support side shoots, trusses and ripening produce. The additional support means may also comprise at least one rod. Preferably, the rod has an attached collar. This enables the plant to be adjustably supported by the collar. Preferably the collar is able to move laterally, responding to the growth of the stem. This enables unrestricted growth of the plant during periods when the plant is unattended. Preferably, the additional support means is attached to at least one bracing bar using a movable grip clip. This enables easy adjustment of the additional support means along the length of the bracing bar without handling of the plant. The clip may be adjusted using one hand and may be readily used by those with reduced finger dexterity. The upper jaw of the movable grip clip may be attached to a plate or tray, or a plate or tray may form the upper jaw of the clip. Preferably the grip clip clamps across a pair of bracing bars. Preferably, all points of contact between the plant and the apparatus are smooth in order to reduce plant damage. For example, the bracing bars and / or the collar may be rounded with a smooth surface. In addition, the apparatus may additionally comprise at least one sleeve on a bracing bar. In use, the sleeve may be used to adjust the gap between the stem and the bracing bar. Additionally, the sleeve may act as a cushioning element for delicate plants. Preferably, the one or more bracing bars are laterally adjustable. The lateral adjustment of the one or more bracing bars may be achieved by moving the bars from one position to another using a series of one or more channels in the upright elements. This enables straightforward adjustment of the bracing bars as support requirements change, for example using the two fingers of one hand only. Preferably, the series of one or more channels is shaped to allow for easy insertion and removal of a bracing bar. As an alternative, the bars may be received into a series of unconnected holes which have an internal diameter sufficient for the bars to be easily inserted and removed and replaced each time for lateral adjustment. The described apparatus may be adapted to support one or more plants in a range of settings. For example, the upright elements may comprise means for connecting the apparatus to a container for growing plants. The means may enable connection, for example, to the wall of a raised bed or planter frame, a tray, a growing bag trough or a platform and cradle for one pot or a series of pots. Alternatively the upright elements may be connectable to means for stabilising the apparatus in soil. For example the upright elements may comprise means to connect the apparatus to rods or bars which enter soil enabling use with plants growing uncontained in open ground. In another aspect, the invention provides a kit of parts for assembly into a plant support system. The plant support system may be readily assembled and disassembled and components of the system, such as the upright elements, the bracer struts and the bracing bars may be formed from a series of smaller parts which are easily joined together for use. This enables the system to be conveniently packaged, stored and transported. The invention will now be further and more particularly described, by way of example only, and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: Figure 1 shows a perspective schematic view of a plant support apparatus. Figure 2 shows an end view of part of an upright element with a pattern of channels for receiving bracing bars. Figure 3 shows a cross sectional view of a bracing bar fitted with a sleeve. Figure 4 shows a plan view of an adjustable support means. Figure 5 shows a cross-sectional view through the additional support means of Figure 4, corresponding to a view along the line Α-Α. Figure 6 shows a schematic representation of a plant support apparatus. The apparatus described herein may be made from a range of materials, such as wood, metal or ultraviolet A resistant plastic material. Referring to Figure 1, the apparatus 1 comprises at least two upright elements 10. The upright elements 10 may be held in a spaced apart relationship by at least one bracer strut 11 which helps to maintain the integrity of the structure. The bracer strut 11 may, for example, pass through the upright elements 10 and be threaded at each end, the thread housing a flange lock nut or similar against the inward face of the upright element 10 and a connector nut or similar against the outward face. Optionally, the bracer struts 11 may be formed from a series of smaller lengths connected together. The apparatus 1 includes one or more bracing bars 12 and one or more additional support means 13 attached to at least one bracing bar 12. In a preferred embodiment the bracing bars 12 are provided in pairs and the plants grow between the bracing bars which provide support to stems, correcting any stray of the stems from the vertical. However, the apparatus may be provided with one or more single bracing bars spaced as appropriate. Additionally, the bracing bars 12 may support side shoots and hanging trusses and ripening produce. The bracing bars 12 may be solid or tubular and are preferably rounded with a smooth surface to minimise damage to delicate plant stems. The bracing bars 12 may, for example, include a groove or other indentation at appropriate intervals or along the length of the bar to facilitate attachment and movement of the additional support means 13. In addition, the bracing bar 12 may carry at least one sleeve 18 to enable small adjustments to the gap between the bracing bar 12 and the stem of an individual plant. Each upright element 10 comprises a lower limb 14 with a shoulder 15. The upright elements may comprise separate parts which are connected before use or may be formed from a single structure. In use, at least one upper limb 16 may be added to a lower limb 14 to increase the height of the apparatus as the supported plants grow. The upper limb 16 and the lower limb 14 may be provided with attachment means (not shown in Figure 1) that overlap in order to facilitate joining the components. Typically, these may be joined with standard techniques, for example using carpentry joints and / or threaded screws and nuts. The shoulder 15 forms part of the lower limb 14 of the upright element 10 and may optionally be integral to the upright element 10, ora separate piece connectable to the upright element 10. The shoulder is shaped to enable use of the proposed device in multiple settings and / or to take fixing attachments, such as clamps, bolts, screws etc. In Figure 1, the apparatus 1 is shown attached to a growing bag trough 17 (attachment means not shown). The shoulder 15 may also be clamped or otherwise attached to, for example, the wall of raised bed or planter frame, a tray, a cradle for one pot or a series of pots etc. Alternatively the shoulder 15 may sit at ground level. The shoulder may be connected to rods or bars which directly enter soil, thus enabling use of the apparatus with plants growing uncontained in open ground. Alternatively, the shoulder may be shaped to be driven directly into soil. The ends of the bracing bars 12 are received into the upright elements 10. Referring to Figure 2, the bracing bar 12 may be received in one of a series of channels 21. The spacing of the channels may be regular or not regular. This series provides for the bracing bars 12 to be adjusted laterally without the need for their removal from the upright and enables adjustment of the gap between bracing bars 12 to be made using two fingers of one hand only. This is an advantage for those with reduced finger dexterity and also enables rapid alteration of the support for a series of plants. The channels are also shaped to enable easy insertion and removal of a bracing bar 12, for example with a part of a channel which has a width and depth sufficient for removal of the bar. As an alternative, the bracing bars 12 may be received into a series of unconnected holes which have an internal diameter sufficient for the bracing bars 12 to be removed and replaced each time for lateral adjustment. A set of channels or holes are placed at intervals vertically in the upright elements 10. The vertical distance between the channels or holes may be the same or different depending on the requirements of the plants being cultivated. This arrangement also enables the bracing bars 12 to be removed and placed higher or lower, or additional bracing bars 12 to be added, depending on the requirements of the growing plants. The distal ends of the bracing bars 12 may be threaded and may be fitted with a washer 22 and a connector nut 23 or similar which may, for example, be tightened by hand. This enables the rigidity of the bracing bars 12 to be maintained and applies inward force opposed to the outward for of the bracer struts 11, maintaining the stability of the apparatus vertically. Optionally, the bracing bars 12 may be formed from a series of smaller lengths connected together. The stems of plants in a row will vary slightly in size and therefore the gap between the bracer bar 12 and the stem may vary. Referring to Figure 3, each bracing bar 12 may carry at least one sleeve 18 which may be moved along the bracing bar 12 to make small adjustments to narrow the gap between the bracing bar 12 and the stem of an individual plant 31. The internal diameter of the sleeve 18 gives space for the outer wall of the sleeve 18 to shift laterally in response to plant growth. Depending on the size of stem 31, the sleeve 18 can be positioned beside the stem 31 to absorb pressure in response to movement and to growth of the stem 31 when unattended. This makes possible particularly sensitive bracing of seedlings and young plants with slight, narrow stems. One or more additional support means 13 may be attached to each bracing bar 12 and may provide support for at least one plant in the direction perpendicular to the support provided by the bracing bars 12. The additional support means 13 may be provided in the form of a movable grip clip. Figure 4 shows an embodiment of the additional support means in the form of a grip clip 40, for attachment to a pair of bracing bars 12. The upper jaw 41 of the grip clip 40 is shaped as a plate or tray which is held substantially horizontal in use. At each side of the upper jaw 41 is provided a rod 42 which is set into flat retainer bar 43 attached to the upper jaw 41, for example by means of at least one screw 47. Alternatively, one end of the rod 42 can be attached to the upper jaw 41 or set directly into this jaw. The rod 42 is provided with a collar 44. The rod 42 may have a head or nut to prevent the collar 44 slipping off the rod. The lower jaw 46 is in the form of a flat plate, and may be the same width as, or less wide than, the upper jaw 41. Preferably, where the jaws 41,46 meet the bracing bar 12 their thickness is identical. In one embodiment, the upper jaw 41 has a raised edge along each of the sides in order to help keep produce in a position supported by the additional support means 13. The raised edge may be fixed on or alongside the upper jaw 41, or be an integral part of the upper jaw 41. The raised edge may be continuous or discontinuous. Preferably, the raised edge has a rounded top. All or some of the parts of the additional support means 13 may be separate pieces joined together or merged as one piece. For example, the additional support means 13 may be made from moulded plastic. The collar 44 braces the stem in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the horizontal bracing bars 12 correcting stray from the vertical. Preferably the additional support element provides a degree of flexibility, for example the internal diameter of the collar 44 may allow for the collar wall to shift laterally or the rod 42 may be flexible. Depending on the size of stem, the collar 44 can be positioned beside the stem, so as to respond to movement and to growth of the stem when unattended, absorbing pressure on the stem and with potential for particularly sensitive bracing of seedlings and young plants with slight, narrow stems. Moving the grip clip 40 along the bracing bar 12 to open the gap between collar 44 and plant stem in one direction relieves pressure on an individual plant stem. Moving in the opposite direction closes the gap to reinforce bracing. Referring to Figure 5, adjustment of the position of the grip clip 40 is easily accomplished using the clip handles 45 which may be squeezed together with one hand, opening the jaws 41,46 and allowing disengagement from the bracing bars 12. The upper jaw 41, shaped for example as a plate or tray, provides upward support to carry side shoots, hanging trusses, and ripening produce. The grip clips can be moved vertically and horizontally for this purpose to any position on any pair of bracing bars 12. It will be apparent to the skilled person that the described apparatus is readily extendable depending on horticultural requirements. A schematic representation of a plant support apparatus 50 is shown in Figure 6. This shows that each upright element 10 may be extended in height using one or more of upper limbs 16. In addition the apparatus may be extended by introducing additional upright elements 10, bracing bars 12 and bracer struts 11 as required. Other variations and modifications will be apparent to the skilled person. Such variations and modifications may involve equivalent and other features that are already known and which may be used instead of, or in addition to, features described herein. Features that are described in the context of separate embodiments may be provided in combination in a single embodiment. Conversely, features that are described in the context of a single embodiment may also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination.
