(6S,8R)-6-(5-bromo-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
Trifluoroacetic acid (319 μL) was added to a solution of (R)-N-(1-(1H-indazol-4-yl)propan-2-yl)-3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropan-1-amine (681 mg, 1.34 mmol) and 5-bromo-3-fluoropicolinaldehyde (287 mg, 1.41 mmol) in toluene (6.39 mL) and the resulting mixture was stirred at 110° C. for 1 hour. The reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature, evaporated to dryness and dissolved in DMSO. The crude product was purified by fFlash reverse phase chromatography (100 g Redisep Rf C18 column), using decreasingly polar mixtures of water (containing 0.1% formic acid) and MeCN (60-100%) as eluents. Fractions containing the desired compound were combined and was isolated by ion exchange chromatography, using an SCX-2 column. The desired product was eluted from the column using 1M NH3/MeOH and pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromo-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (763 mg, 82%) as an off-white solid.
