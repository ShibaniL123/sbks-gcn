BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The Wnt signaling pathways are a group of signal transduction pathways made of proteins that pass signals from outside of a cell through cell surface receptors to the inside of the cell. Wnt proteins are secreted glycoproteins with a molecular weight in the range of 39-46 kD, whereby in total 19 different members of the Wnt protein family are known (McMahon et al., Trends Genet. 8, 1992, 236 - 242). They are the ligands of so-called Frizzled receptors, which form a family of seven-transmembrane spanning receptors comprising 10 distinct subtypes. A certain Wnt ligand can thereby activate several different Frizzled receptor subtypes and vice versa a particular Frizzled receptor can be activated by different Wnt protein subtypes (Fluang et al., Genome Biol. 5, 2004, 234.1-234.8). Binding of a Wnt to its receptor can activate two different signaling cascades, one is called the ηοηcanonical pathway, which involves CamK II and PKC (Kuhl et al., Trends Genet. 16 (7), 2000, 279 283). The other, the so-called canonical pathway (Tamai et al., Mol. Cell 13, 2004, 149-156) regulates the concentration of the transcription factor p-catenin. In the case of non-stimulated canonical Wnt signaling, p-catenin is captured by a destruction complex consisting of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), glycogen synthase kinase 3-p (GSK-3P), Axin-1 or -2 and Casein Kinase lot. Captured p-catenin is then phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the proteasome. However, when a canonical Wnt activates the membrane complex of a Frizzled receptor and its Lipoprotein 5 or 6 (LRP 5/6) co-receptor, this leads to the recruitment of dishevelled (Dvl) by the receptors and subsequent phosphorylation of LRP 5/6, followed by binding of Axin-1 or Axin-2 to the membrane complex as well. The deprivation of Axin from the p-catenin destruction complex leads to the disassembly of the latter and p-catenin can reach the nucleus, where it together with TCF and LEF transcription factors and other transcriptional coregulators like Pygopus, BCL9/Legless, CDK8 module of Mediator and TRRAP initiates transcription of genes with promoters containing TCF elements (Najdi, J. Carcinogenesis 2011; 10:5). The Wnt signaling cascade can be constitutively activated by mutations in genes involved in this pathway. This is especially well documented for mutations of the APC and axin genes, and also for mutations of the p-catenin phosphorylation sites, all of which are important for the development of colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas (Polakis, ΕΜΒΟ J., 31, 2012, 2737-2746). The Wnt signaling cascade has important physiological roles in embryonal development and tissue homeostasis the latter especially for hair follicles, bones and the gastrointestinal tract. Deregulation of the Wnt pathway can activate in a cell and tissue specific manner a number of genes known to be important in carcinogenesis. Among them are c-myc, cyclin Dl, Axin-2 and metalloproteases (He et al., Science 281, 1998, 1509-1512). Deregulated Wnt activity can drive cancer formation, increased Wnt signaling can thereby be caused through autocrine Wnt signaling, as shown for different breast, ovarian, prostate and lung carcinomas as well as for various cancer cell lines (Bafico, Cancer Cell 6, 2004, 497-506; Yee, Mol. Cancer 9, 2010, 162-176; Nguyen, Cell 138, 2009, 51-62). For cancer stem cells (CSCs) it was shown that they have increased Wnt signaling activity and that its inhibition can reduce the formation of metastases (Vermeulen et al., Nature Cell Biol. 12 (5), 2010, 468-476; Polakis, ΕΜΒΟ J. 31, 2012, 2737-2746; Reya, Nature, 434, 2005, 843-850). Furthermore, there is a lot of evidence supporting an important role of Wnt signaling in cardiovascular diseases. One aspect thereby is heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy where deletion of Dapper-1, an activator of the canonical p-catenin Wnt pathway has been shown to reduce functional impairement and hypertrophy (Hagenmueller, Μ. et al.: Dapper-1 induces myocardial remodeling through activation of canonical wnt signaling in cardiomyocytes; Hypertension, 61 (6), 2013, 1177-1183). Additional support for a role of Wnt signaling in heart failure comes from animal experimental models and clinical studies with patients, in which it was shown, that the level of secreted frizzled related protein 3 (sFRP3) is associated with the progression of heart failure (Askevold, Ε.Τ. et al.: The cardiokine secreted Frizzled-related protein 3, a modulator of Wnt signaling in clinical and experimental heart failure; J. Intern Med., 2014 (doi:10.1111/joim.l2175)). For cardiac remodeling and infarct healing the expression of Fzd2 receptors on myofibroblasts migrating into the infarct area has been demonstrated (Blankesteijn, W.M. et al.: A homologue of Drosophila tissue polarity gene frizzled is expressed in migrating myofibroblasts in the infarcted rat heart; Nat. Med. 3, 1997, 541-544). The manifold effects of Wnt signaling in heart failure, fibrosis and arrhythmias have been recently reviewed by Dawson et al. (Dawson, Κ. et al.: Role of the Wnt-Frizzled system in cardiac pathophysiology: a rapidly developing, poorly understood area with enormous potential; J. Physiol. 591 (6), 2013, 1409-1432). For the vasculature, effects of Wnt signaling could be shown as well, mainly in respect to restenosis via enhancement of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation (Tsaousi, A. et al.: Wnt4/b-catenin signaling induces VSMC proliferation and is associated with initmal thickening; Circ. Res. 108, 2011, 427-436). Besides the effects on heart and vasculature, dysregulated Wnt signaling is also an important component in chronic kidney disease as could be shown for upregulated Wnt activity in immune cells from corresponding patients (Al-Chaqmaqchi, Η.Α. et al.: Activation of Wnt/b-catenin pathway in monocytes derived from chronic kidney disease patients; PLoS One, 8 (7), 2013, doi: 10.1371) and altered levels of secreted Wnt inhibitor in patient sera (de Oliveira, R.B. et al.: Disturbances of Wnt/bcatenin pathway and energy metabolism in early CKD: effect of phosphate binders; Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. (2013) 28 (10): 2510-2517). In adults, mis-regulation of the Wnt pathway also leads to a variety of abnormalities and degenerative diseases. An LRP mutation has been identified that causes increased bone density at defined locations such as the jaw and palate (Boyden LM et al.: High bone density due to a mutation in LDL-receptor-related protein 5; Ν Engl J Med. 2002 May 16; 346(20):1513-21, Gong Υ, et al.: LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) affects bone accrual and eye development; Cell 2001; 107:513-23). The mutation is a single amino-acid substitution that makes LRP5 insensitive to Dkk-mediated Wnt pathway inhibition, indicating that the phenotype results from overactive Wnt signaling in the bone. Recent reports have suggested that Wnt signaling is an important regulator for adipogenesis or insulin secretion and might be involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. It has been shown that expression of the Wnt5B gene was detectable in several tissues, including adipose, pancreas, and liver. Subsequent in vitro experiments identified the fact that expression of the Wnt5b gene was increased at an early phase of adipocyte differentiation in mouse 3T3-L1 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of the Wnt5b gene in preadipocytes resulted in the promotion of adipogenesis and the enhancement of adipocytokine-gene expression. These results indicate that the Wnt5B gene may contribute to conferring susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease through the regulation of adipocyte function (Kanazawa A, et al.: Association of the gene encoding wingless-type mammary tumor virus integration-site family member 5Β (Wnt5B) with type 2 diabetes; Am J Flum Genet. 2004 Nov; 75(5):832-43) Accordingly, identification of methods and compounds that modulate the Wnt - dependent cellular responses may offer an avenue for regulating physiological functions and therapeutic treatment of diseases associated with aberrant activity of the pathways.

The term "substituted" means that one or more hydrogens on the designated atom is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valency under the existing circumstances is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. The term "optionally substituted" means that the number of substituents can be zero. Unless otherwise indicated, optionally substituted groups may be substituted with as many optional substituents as can be accommodated by replacing a hydrogen atom with a non-hydrogen substituent on any available carbon or nitrogen atom.

Where the plural form of the word compounds, salts, polymorphs, hydrates, solvates and the like, is used herein, this is taken to mean also a single compound, salt, polymorph, isomer, hydrate, solvate or the like. The compounds of this invention contain one or more asymmetric centres, depending upon the location and nature of the various substituents desired. Asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in the (R) or (S) configuration. In certain instances, asymmetry may also be present due to restricted rotation about a given bond, for example, the central bond adjoining two substituted aromatic rings of the specified compounds. Substituents on a ring may also be present in either cis or trans form. It is intended that all such configurations are included within the scope of the present invention. Preferred compounds are those which produce the more desirable biological activity. Separated, pure or partially purified isomers and stereoisomers or racemic or diastereomeric mixtures of the compounds of this invention are also included within the scope of the present invention. The purification and the separation of such materials can be accomplished by standard techniques known in the art. The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes, for example, by the formation of diastereoisomeric salts using an optically active acid or base or formation of covalent diastereomers. Examples of appropriate acids are tartaric, diacetyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic acid. Mixtures of diastereoisomers can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical and/or chemical differences by methods known in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallisation. The optically active bases or acids are then liberated from the separated diastereomeric salts. A different process for separation of optical isomers involves the use of chiral chromatography (e.g., chiral HPLC columns), with or without conventional derivatisation, optimally chosen to maximise the separation of the enantiomers. Suitable chiral HPLC columns are manufactured by Diacel, e.g., Chiracel OD and Chiracel OJ among many others, all routinely selectable. Enzymatic separations, with or without derivatisation, are also useful. The optically active compounds of this invention can likewise be obtained by chiral syntheses utilizing optically active starting materials. In order to limit different types of isomers from each other reference is made to IUPAC Rules Section Ε (Pure Appl Chem 45, 11-30, 1976). The invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of a compound of the invention. An isotopic variation of a compound of the invention is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually or predominantly found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into a compound of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, such as 2H (deuterium), 3H (tritium), nC, 13C, 14C, 1SN, 170, 180, 32P, 33P, 33S, 34S, 35S, 36S, 1SF, 36CI, 82Br, 123l, 124l, 129l and 131l, respectively. Certain isotopic variations of a compound of the invention, for example, those in which one or more radioactive isotopes such as 3H or 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopic variations of a compound of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures known by a person skilled in the art such as by the illustrative methods or by the preparations described in the examples hereafter using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents. The present invention includes all possible stereoisomers of the compounds of the present invention as single stereoisomers, or as any mixture of said stereoisomers, in any ratio.

GENERAL SYNTHESIS OF THE COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION The following paragraphs outline a variety of synthetic approaches suitable to prepare compounds of formulae (la), (lb) and (Ic), in which LA, R1, R2, R3, R5 and R6 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra. Formulae (la) and (lb), in which R4 represents hydrogen, both constitute subsets of formula (I) in that they feature different orientations of the amide linker LB, which stands for -NH-C(=0)- in formula (la) whilst representing -C(=0)-NH- in formula (lb), as shown in Scheme A. In formula (Ic), LB represents -C(=0)-NH-, alike formula (lb), and R4 is as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, but different from hydrogen. Scheme A: Formulae (I), (la), lb), and (Ic). In addition to the routes described below, also other routes may be used to synthesise the target compounds, in accordance with common general knowledge of a person skilled in the art of organic synthesis. The order of transformations exemplified in the following Schemes is therefore not intended to be limiting, and suitable synthesis steps from various schemes can be combined to form additional synthesis sequences. In addition, interconversion of any of the substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and/or R6, can be achieved before and/or after the exemplified transformations. These modifications can be such as the introduction of protective groups, cleavage of protective groups, reduction or oxidation of functional groups, halogenation, metallation, metal catalysed coupling reactions, substitution or other reactions known to a person skilled in the art. These transformations include those which introduce a functionality allowing for further interconversion of substituents. Appropriate protective groups and their introduction and cleavage are well-known to a person skilled in the art (see for example T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd edition, Wiley 1999). Specific examples are described in the subsequent paragraphs. Further, it is possible that two or more successive steps may be performed without work-up being performed between said steps, e.g. in a "one-pot" reaction, as it is well-known to a person skilled in the art. Scheme Β outlines the preparation of compounds of the formula (la), in which LA, R1, R2, R3, R5, and R6 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, starting from mefa-nitrobenzoic acid derivatives (II), in which R5 and R6 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), which can be converted into the corresponding benzoyl chlorides (III), by treatment with a suitable chlorinating agent, such as oxalyl chloride. Benzoic acid derivatives of the formula (II) are well known to the person skilled in the art, and are often commercially available. Said benzoyl chlorides of the formula (III) can be subsequently converted into amides of the general formula (V), e.g. directly by aminolysis with amines R3-R2-NH2, in which R2 and R3 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I). Alternatively, amides of the formula (V) can be accomplished in two steps by aminolysis of (III) using an amine X-R2-NH2, in which R2 is as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), giving rise to amides of the formula (IV). Said amides can be subsequently coupled with R3-X', in which R3 is as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), in a palladium catalysed coupling reaction such as a Suzuki coupling to furnish amides of general formula (V). In X-R2-NFl2 and R3-X', both X and X' represent groups enabling palladium catalysed coupling reactions, such as chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy, -S(=0)2C4Fg (nonaflyl) or a boronic acid or an ester thereof, with the proviso that if X represents a boronic ester or an ester thereof, X' stands for bromo, iodo, trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy or nonaflyl and the like, or vice versa. The nitro group present in said amides (V) is then reduced by treatment with a suitable reducing agent, such as titanium(lll)chloride, or hydrogenation in the presence of a suitable catalyst, e.g. palladium on charcoal, to give anilines of the formula (VI). Said anilines of the formula (VI) are then elaborated into compounds of the formula (la). This can be accomplished directly by reacting a compound of the formula (VI) with a carboxylic acid HChC-l^-R1, wherein LA and R1 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), in an amide coupling reaction, for example in the presence of a tertiary aliphatic amine, such as /V,/V-diisopropylethylamine, and 2,4,6-tripropyl-l,3,5,2,4,6-trioxaphosphinane 2,4,6-trioxide (also known as Τ3Ρ), in a suitable sovent such as Λ/,Λ/dimethylformamide. Alternatively, the transformation of anilines (VI) into compounds of the formula (la) can be performed by reaction of anilines (VI) with suitable reagents such as Cl-C(=0)-LA-R1, or, in a two step synthesis firstly with Cl-C(=0)-LA-LG, in which LA is as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), and LG stands for a leaving group, preferably chloro or bromo, to give the corresponding compounds of formula (VII), which are subsequently reacted with agents suitable for the introduction of R1, exemplified by but not limited to cyclic secondary amines, to give compounds of the formula (la). Scheme Β: Preparation of compounds of the formula (la) from mefa-nitrobenzoic acid derivatives of formula (II) Alternatively, compounds of the formula (la) can be prepared starting from mefa-aminobenzoic acid derivatives of formula (VIII), in which R5 and R6 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, as outlined in Scheme C. Said mefa-aminobenzoic acid derivatives of formula (VIII) are well known to the person skilled in the art and are commercially available in many cases. Compounds of formula (VIII) can be reacted with an amine R3R2NH2, in which R2 and R3 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, in a standard amide coupling reaction, to give amide derivatives of formula (VI). Said compounds of formula (VI) can also be obtained by coupling the aformentioned acids of formula (VIII) with an amine X-R2-NH2, in which R2 is as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, giving rise to amides of the formula (IX). These are subsequently subjected to a palladium catalysed coupling reaction, such as a Suzuki coupling, with R3-X', in which R3 is as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), in order to furnish amides of general formula (VI), respectively. In X-R2-NH2 and R3-X', both X and X' represent groups enabling palladium catalysed coupling reactions, such as bromo, iodo, trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy, nonaflyl or a boronic acid or an ester thereof, with the proviso that if X represents a boronic ester or an ester thereof, X' stands for bromo, iodo, trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy or nonaflyl and the like, or vice versa. Amides of the formula (VI) are subsequently converted into compounds of formula (la) as described supra in context with Scheme Β. Scheme C: Preparation of compounds of the formula (la) from mefa-aminobenzoic acid derivatives of formula (VIII) The sequence of synthetic steps can be varied as outlined in Scheme D, in order to convert metaaminobenzoic acid derivatives of formula (VIII), in which R5 and R6 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), into compounds of the formula (la). Said benzoic acid derivatives of the formula (VIII) can be converted into compounds of the formula (X), in which LG stands for a leaving group, preferably chloro or bromo, followed e.g. by aminolysis of compounds of the formula (X) using reagents suitable for the introduction of R1, exemplified by but not limited to suitable cyclic secondary amines, to give compounds of the formula (XI). Subsequently, the carboxy group present in compounds of the formula (XI) can be coupled with an amine R3R2NH2, in which R2 and R3 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, in an amide coupling reaction, for example in the presence of a tertiary aliphatic amine, such as /V,/V-diisopropylethylamine, and 2,4,6-tripropyl-1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxaphosphinane 2,4,6-trioxide (also known as Τ3Ρ), in a suitable solvent such as Ν,Νdimethylformamide, to afford compounds of the formula (la). Scheme D: Alternative preparation of compounds of the formula (la) from mefa-aminobenzoic acid derivatives of formula (VIII) Instead of said benzoic acid derivatives of formula (VIII), also the corresponding ester analogues of formula (XII), in which R5 and R6 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), and in which Re stands for a Ci-C6-alkyl group, preferably methyl or ethyl, can be employed in a similar fashion in order to prepare compounds of the formula (la), as outlined in Scheme Ε. Esters of the formula (XII) are well known to the person skilled in the art, and are commercially available in many cases. Elaboration of said benzoic acid esters of formula (XII) into compounds of formula (XIV), in which R1 is as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, can proceed via compounds of formula (XIII), in which LG stands for a leaving group, preferably chloro or bromo, and can be performed analogously as described in context with Scheme D. Subsequently, the ester group present in compounds of formula (XIV) can be saponified by reaction with e.g. lithium hydroxide to yield the lithium salt of the formula (Xla). Said lithium salt of formula (Xla) or the corresponding carboxylic acid is then converted into compounds of formula (la). Scheme Ε: Preparation of compounds of the formula (la) from mefa-aminobenzoic acid esters of formula (XII) A first approach to compounds of the formula (lb) from mefa-nitroaniline derivatives of formula (XV), in which R5 and R6 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, is outlined in Scheme F. Said mefa-nitroaniline derivatives of formula (XV) are well known to the person skilled in the art, and are often commercially available. They can be converted into amide derivatives of formula (XVI) e.g. by a reacting with a carboxylic acid chloride R3-R2-C(=0)CI, in which R2 and R3 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, in the presence of a suitable base, such as potassium carbonate, and in a suitable solvent, such as acetonitrile. Basic solvents, such as pyridine, can take over both the role of a base and of a solvent, respectively. Alternatively, conversion of (XV) into (XVI) can be performed via standard amide coupling reactions. The nitro group present in amides of the formula (XVI) can be subsequently reduced e.g. by hydrogenation in the presence of a suitable catalyst, e.g. palladium on charcoal, to give the corresponding aniline derivatives of formula (XVII). Said anilines of the formula (XVII) can then be elaborated into compounds of the formula (lb). This can be accomplished directly by reacting a compound of the formula (XVII) with a carboxylic acid HChC-l^-R1, wherein LAand R1 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), in an amide coupling reaction, for example in the presence of a tertiary aliphatic amine, such as Λ/,Λ/diisopropylethylamine, and 2,4,6-tripropyl-l,3,5,2,4,6-trioxaphosphinane 2,4,6-trioxide (also known as Τ3Ρ), in a suitable sovent such as /V,/V-dimethylformamide. Alternatively, the transformation of anilines (XVII) into compounds of the formula (la) can be performed by reaction of anilines (XVII) with suitable reagents, such as Cl-C(=0)-LA-LG, in which LA is as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), and LG stands for a leaving group, preferably chloro or bromo, to give the corresponding compounds of formula (XVIII), which are subsequently reacted with agents suitable for the introduction of R1, exemplified by but not limited to cyclic secondary amines, to give compounds of the formula (lb). Scheme F: Preparation of compounds of the formula (lb) from mefa-nitroaniline derivatives of formula (XV) Scheme G outlines an approach complimentary to Scheme F as an alternative synthesis route for compounds of the formula (lb), from mefa-nitroaniline derivatives of formula (XIX), in which R5 and R6 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, and which differ from the compounds of formula (XV) by the inverse arrangement of their nitro and amino groups, respectively. Said mefa-nitroaniline derivatives of formula (XIX) are well known to the person skilled in the art, and are often commercially available. They can be converted into amide derivatives of formula (XX), in which LA is as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, and in which LG stands for a leaving group, preferably chloro or bromo, by a reacting with a carboxylic acid LG-LA-CO2H, in a standard amide coupling reaction. Said amides of the formula (XX) can be subsequently converted into compounds of the formula (XXI), in which R1 is as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, using reagents suitable for the introduction of R1, exemplified by but not limited to cyclic secondary amines. The nitro group present in amides of the formula (XXI) is then reduced e.g. by hydrogenation in the presence of a suitable catalyst, e.g. palladium on charcoal, to give the corresponding aniline derivatives of formula (XXII). Compounds of formula (XXII) can be reacted with a carboxylic acid R3R2CC>2H, wherein R2 and R3 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, in an amide coupling reaction, for example in the presence of a tertiary aliphatic amine, such as /V,/V-diisopropylethylamine, and 2,4,6-tripropyl-l,3,5,2,4,6-trioxaphosphinane 2,4,6-trioxide (also known as Τ3Ρ), in a suitable sovent such as Ν,Νdimethylformamide, to give compounds of the formula (lb). The compounds of formula (lb) can also be obtained by coupling the aformentioned anilines of formula (XXII) with a carboxylic acid X-R2-CO2H, in which R2 is as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, giving rise to amides of the formula (XXIII). These can be subsequently subjected to a palladium catalysed coupling reaction, such as a Suzuki coupling, with R3-X', in which R3 is as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), in order to furnish compounds of the formula (lb), respectively. In X-R2-CC>2H and R3-X', both X and X' represent groups enabling palladium catalysed coupling reactions, such as chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy, nonaflyl or a boronic acid or an ester thereof, with the proviso that if X represents a boronic ester or an ester thereof, X' stands for chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoromethylsulfonyloxy or nonaflyl and the like, or vice versa. Scheme G: Preparation of compounds of the formula (lb) from mefa-nitroaniline derivatives of formula (XIX) Scheme Η illustrates the introduction of R4 groups different from hydrogen. In order so to do, primary anilines of the formula (XVII), in which LA, R1, R2, R3, R5, and R6 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, and which can be prepared according to Scheme F, can be converted into secondary anilines of the formula (XXIV), in which R4 is as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, but different from hydrogen. This can be accomplished by various methods known to the person skilled in the art, such as a reductive amination with an aldehyde suitable to confer R4, e.g. benzaldehyde for R4 = benzyl, in the presence of a suitable borohydride reagent, such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride, and in the presence of a suitable acid, such as acetic acid, in a suitable solvent, such as a chlorinated hydrocarbon, preferably dichloromethane. The resulting compounds of the formula (XXIV) are subsequently elaborated into compounds of the formula (Ic), in which LA, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are as defined for the compounds of general formula (I), supra, with the proviso that R4 is different from hydrogen. Scheme Η: Preparation of compounds of the formula (Ic) from aniline derivatives of formula (XVII) Further details (reaction conditions, suitable solvents etc.) can be obtained from the experimental section below. In the present text, in particular in the Experimental Section, for the synthesis of intermediates and of examples of the present invention, when a compound is mentioned as a salt form with the corresponding base or acid, the exact stoichiometric composition of said salt form, as obtained by the respective preparation and/or purification process, is, in most cases, unknown. Unless specified otherwise, suffixes to chemical names or structural formulae such as "hydrochloride", "trifluoroacetate", "sodium salt", or "x HCI", "x CF3COOH", "x Na+", for example, are to be understood as not a stoichiometric specification, but solely as a salt form. This applies analogously to cases in which synthesis intermediates or example compounds or salts thereof have been obtained, by the preparation and/or purification processes described, as solvates, such as hydrates with (if defined) unknown stoichiometric composition.

Pharmaceutical compositions of the compounds of the invention This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more compounds of the present invention. These compositions can be utilised to achieve the desired pharmacological effect by administration to a patient in need thereof. A patient, for the purpose of this invention, is a mammal, including a human, in need of treatment for the particular condition or disease. Therefore, the present invention includes pharmaceutical compositions that are comprised of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound, or salt thereof, of the present invention. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is preferably a carrier that is relatively non-toxic and innocuous to a patient at concentrations consistent with effective activity of the active ingredient so that any side effects ascribable to the carrier do not vitiate the beneficial effects of the active ingredient. A pharmaceutically effective amount of compound is preferably that amount which produces a result or exerts an influence on the particular condition being treated. The compounds of the present invention can be administered with pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers well known in the art using any effective conventional dosage unit forms, including immediate, slow and timed release preparations, orally, parenterally, topically, nasally, ophthalmically, optically, sublingually, rectally, vaginally, and the like. For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated into solid or liquid preparations such as capsules, pills, tablets, troches, lozenges, melts, powders, solutions, suspensions, or emulsions, and may be prepared according to methods known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. The solid unit dosage forms can be a capsule that can be of the ordinary hard- or soft-shelled gelatine type containing, for example, surfactants, lubricants, and inert fillers such as lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate, and corn starch. In another embodiment, the compounds of this invention may be tableted with conventional tablet bases such as lactose, sucrose and cornstarch in combination with binders such as acacia, corn starch or gelatine, disintegrating agents intended to assist the break-up and dissolution of the tablet following administration such as potato starch, alginic acid, corn starch, and guar gum, gum tragacanth, acacia, lubricants intended to improve the flow of tablet granulation and to prevent the adhesion of tablet material to the surfaces of the tablet dies and punches, for example talc, stearic acid, or magnesium, calcium or zinc stearate, dyes, colouring agents, and flavouring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavouring, intended to enhance the aesthetic qualities of the tablets and make them more acceptable to the patient. Suitable excipients for use in oral liquid dosage forms include dicalcium phosphate and diluents such as water and alcohols, for example, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, and polyethylene alcohols, either with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, suspending agent or emulsifying agent. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance tablets, pills or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. Dispersible powders and granules are suitable for the preparation of an aqueous suspension. They provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example those sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents described above, may also be present. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil such as liquid paraffin or a mixture of vegetable oils. Suitable emulsifying agents may be (1) naturally occurring gums such as gum acacia and gum tragacanth, (2) naturally occurring phosphatides such as soy bean and lecithin, (3) esters or partial esters derived form fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example, sorbitan monooleate, (4) condensation products of said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring agents. Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil such as, for example, arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent such as, for example, beeswax, hard paraffin, or cetyl alcohol. The suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example, ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate ; one or more colouring agents ; one or more flavouring agents ; and one or more sweetening agents such as sucrose or saccharin. Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents such as, for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, and preservative, such as methyl and propyl parabens and flavouring and colouring agents. The compounds of this invention may also be administered parenterally, that is, subcutaneously, intravenously, intraocularly, intrasynovially, intramuscularly, or interperitoneally, as injectable dosages of the compound in preferably a physiologically acceptable diluent with a pharmaceutical carrier which can be a sterile liquid or mixture of liquids such as water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, an alcohol such as ethanol, isopropanol, or hexadecyl alcohol, glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol, glycerol ketals such as 2,2-dimethyl-l,l-dioxolane-4-methanol, ethers such as poly(ethylene glycol) 400, an oil, a fatty acid, a fatty acid ester or, a fatty acid glyceride, or an acetylated fatty acid glyceride, with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant such as a soap or a detergent, suspending agent such as pectin, carbomers, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, or carboxymethylcellulose, or emulsifying agent and other pharmaceutical adjuvants. Illustrative of oils which can be used in the parenteral formulations of this invention are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, olive oil, petrolatum and mineral oil. Suitable fatty acids include oleic acid, stearic acid, isostearic acid and myristic acid. Suitable fatty acid esters are, for example, ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate. Suitable soaps include fatty acid alkali metal, ammonium, and triethanolamine salts and suitable detergents include cationic detergents, for example dimethyl dialkyl ammonium halides, alkyl pyridinium halides, and alkylamine acetates ; anionic detergents, for example, alkyl, aryl, and olefin sulfonates, alkyl, olefin, ether, and monoglyceride sulfates, and sulfosuccinates ; non-ionic detergents, for example, fatty amine oxides, fatty acid alkanolamides, and poly(oxyethylene-oxypropylene)s or ethylene oxide or propylene oxide copolymers ; and amphoteric detergents, for example, alkyl-beta-aminopropionates, and 2-alkylimidazoline quarternary ammonium salts, as well as mixtures. The parenteral compositions of this invention will typically contain from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight of the active ingredient in solution. Preservatives and buffers may also be used advantageously. In order to minimise or eliminate irritation at the site of injection, such compositions may contain a non-ionic surfactant having a hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) preferably of from about 12 to about 17. The quantity of surfactant in such formulation preferably ranges from about 5% to about 15% by weight. The surfactant can be a single component having the above HLB or can be a mixture of two or more components having the desired HLB. Illustrative of surfactants used in parenteral formulations are the class of polyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, for example, sorbitan monooleate and the high molecular weight adducts of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base, formed by the condensation of propylene oxide with propylene glycol. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of sterile injectable aqueous suspensions. Such suspensions may be formulated according to known methods using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents such as, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia ; dispersing or wetting agents which may be a naturally occurring phosphatide such as lecithin, a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid, for example, polyoxyethylene stearate, a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol, for example, heptadeca-ethyleneoxycetanol, a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived form a fatty acid and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or a condensation product of an ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent. Diluents and solvents that may be employed are, for example, water, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride solutions and isotonic glucose solutions. In addition, sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as solvents or suspending media. For this purpose, any bland, fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid can be used in the preparation of injectables. A composition of the invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritation excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are, for example, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycol. Another formulation employed in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices ("patches"). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art (see, e.g., US Patent No. 5,023,252, issued June 11, 1991, incorporated herein by reference). Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Controlled release formulations for parenteral administration include liposomal, polymeric microsphere and polymeric gel formulations that are known in the art. It may be desirable or necessary to introduce the pharmaceutical composition to the patient via a mechanical delivery device. The construction and use of mechanical delivery devices for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. Direct techniques for, for example, administering a drug directly to the brain usually involve placement of a drug delivery catheter into the patient's ventricular system to bypass the blood-brain barrier. One such implantable delivery system, used for the transport of agents to specific anatomical regions of the body, is described in US Patent No. 5,011,472, issued April 30, 1991. The compositions of the invention can also contain other conventional pharmaceutically acceptable compounding ingredients, generally referred to as carriers or diluents, as necessary or desired. Conventional procedures for preparing such compositions in appropriate dosage forms can be utilized. Such ingredients and procedures include those described in the following references, each of which is incorporated herein by reference: Powell, M.F. et al., "Compendium of Excipients for Parenteral Formulations" PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science & Technology 1998, 52(5), 238-311 ; Strickley, R.G "Parenteral Formulations of Small Molecule Therapeutics Marketed in the United States (1999)-Part-1" PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science & Technology 1999, 53(6), 324-349 ; and Nema, S. et al., "Excipients and Their Use in Injectable Products" PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science & Technology 1997, 51(4), 166-171.

These disorders have been well characterized in humans, but also exist with a similar etiology in other mammals, and can be treated by administering pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention. The term "treating" or "treatment" as stated throughout this document is used conventionally, e.g., the management or care of a subject for the purpose of combating, alleviating, reducing, relieving, improving the condition of, etc., of a disease or disorder, such as a carcinoma. Dose and administration Based upon standard laboratory techniques known to evaluate compounds useful for the treatment of hyper-proliferative disorders and angiogenic disorders, by standard toxicity tests and by standard pharmacological assays for the determination of treatment of the conditions identified above in mammals, and by comparison of these results with the results of known medicaments that are used to treat these conditions, the effective dosage of the compounds of this invention can readily be determined for treatment of each desired indication. The amount of the active ingredient to be administered in the treatment of one of these conditions can vary widely according to such considerations as the particular compound and dosage unit employed, the mode of administration, the period of treatment, the age and sex of the patient treated, and the nature and extent of the condition treated. The total amount of the active ingredient to be administered will generally range from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg body weight per day, and preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 20 mg/kg body weight per day. Clinically useful dosing schedules will range from one to three times a day dosing to once every four weeks dosing. In addition, "drug holidays" in which a patient is not dosed with a drug for a certain period of time, may be beneficial to the overall balance between pharmacological effect and tolerability. A unit dosage may contain from about 0.5 mg to about 1500 mg of active ingredient, and can be administered one or more times per day or less than once a day. The average daily dosage for administration by injection, including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and parenteral injections, and use of infusion techniques will preferably be from 0.01 to 200 mg/kg of total body weight. The average daily rectal dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.01 to 200 mg/kg of total body weight. The average daily vaginal dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.01 to 200 mg/kg of total body weight. The average daily topical dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.1 to 200 mg administered between one to four times daily. The transdermal concentration will preferably be that required to maintain a daily dose of from 0.01 to 200 mg/kg. The average daily inhalation dosage regimen will preferably be from 0.01 to 100 mg/kg of total body weight. Of course the specific initial and continuing dosage regimen for each patient will vary according to the nature and severity of the condition as determined by the attending diagnostician, the activity of the specific compound employed, the age and general condition of the patient, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion of the drug, drug combinations, and the like. The desired mode of treatment and number of doses of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester or composition thereof can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional treatment tests. Preferably, the diseases of said method are haematological tumours, solid tumour and/or metastases thereof. The compounds of the present invention can be used in particular in therapy and prevention, i.e. prophylaxis, of tumour growth and metastases, especially in solid tumours of all indications and stages with or without pre-treatment of the tumour growth. Methods of testing for a particular pharmacological or pharmaceutical property are well known to persons skilled in the art. The example testing experiments described herein serve to illustrate the present invention and the invention is not limited to the examples given. Combination therapies The term "combination" in the present invention is used as known to persons skilled in the art and may be present as a fixed combination, a non-fixed combination or kit-of-parts. A "fixed combination" in the present invention is used as known to persons skilled in the art and is defined as a combination wherein the said first active ingredient and the said second active ingredient are present together in one unit dosage or in a single entity. One example of a "fixed combination" is a pharmaceutical composition wherein the said first active ingredient and the said second active ingredient are present in admixture for simultaneous administration, such as in a formulation. Another example of a "fixed combination" is a pharmaceutical combination wherein the said first active ingredient and the said second active ingredient are present in one unit without being in admixture. A non-fixed combination or "kit-of-parts" in the present invention is used as known to persons skilled in the art and is defined as a combination wherein the said first active ingredient and the said second active ingredient are present in more than one unit. One example of a non-fixed combination or kit-of-parts is a combination wherein the said first active ingredient and the said second active ingredient are present separately. The components of the non-fixed combination or kit-of-parts may be administered separately, sequentially, simultaneously, concurrently or chronologically staggered.

Biological assays Examples were tested in selected biological assays one or more times. When tested more than once, data are reported as either average values or as median values, wherein • the average value, also referred to as the arithmetic mean value, represents the sum of the values obtained divided by the number of times tested, and • the median value represents the middle number of the group of values when ranked in ascending or descending order. If the number of values in the data set is odd, the median is the middle value. If the number of values in the data set is even, the median is the arithmetic mean of the two middle values. Examples were synthesized one or more times. When synthesized more than once, data from biological assays represent average values or median values calculated utilizing data sets obtained from testing of one or more synthetic batch. Measurement of the inhibitory activity of selected compounds on the Wnt signaling cascade In order to discover and characterize small molecules which inhibit the constitutive active colorectal cancer cell (CRC) Wnt pathway, a cellular reporter assay was employed. The corresponding assay cell was generated by transfection of the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 (ATCC, #CCL-247) with the Super TopFlash vector (Morin, Science 275, 1997, 1787-1790; Molenaar et al., Cell 86 (3), 1996, 391-399). The HCT116 cell line is cultivated at 37°C and 5% CO2 in DMEM/F-12 (Life Technologies, #11320-074), supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 20 mM HEPES, 1.4 mM pyruvate, 0.15% Na-bicarbonate and 10% foetal bovine serum (GIBCO, #10270), this cancer cell line is pathophysiological relevant since it carries a deletion of position S45 in the p-catenin gene, leading to constitutive active Wnt signaling. Stable transfectants were generated by cotransfection with pcDNA3 and selection of stable transfected cells with 1 mg/ml G418. In a parallel approach, HCT116 cells were cotransfected with the FOP control vector and pcDNA3. The FOP vector is identical to the TOP construct, but it contains instead of functional TCF elements a randomized, non-functional sequence. For this transfection a stable transfected cell line was generated as well. In preparation of the assay, the two cell lines were plated 24 hours before at 10000 cells per well of a 384 micro titre plate (ΜΤΡ) in 30 pL growth medium. Selective inhibitory activity for small molecules on the mutated Wnt pathway was determined after parallel incubation of both (TOP and FOP) HCT116 reporter cell lines with a compound dilution series from 50 μΜ to 15 ηΜ in steps of 3.16-fold dilutions in CAFTY buffer (130 mM NaCI, 5 mM KCI, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCI2, 5 mM NaHCOs, pH 7.4) containing 2 mM Ca2+ and 0.01% BSA. The compounds were thereby serially prediluted in 100% DMSO and thereafter in addition 50 fold into the CAFTY compound dilution buffer (described above). From this dilution 10 pL were added to the cells in 30 pL growth medium and incubated for 36 hours at 37°C and 5% C02. Thereafter luciferase assay buffer (1:1 mixture of luciferase substrate buffer (20 mM Tricine, 2.67 mM MgS04, 0.1 mM EDTA, 4 mM DTT, 270 μΜ Coenzyme A, 470 μΜ Luciferin, 530 μΜ ATP, ph adjusted to pH 7.8 with a sufficient volume of 5Μ NaOH) and Triton buffer (30 mL Triton Χ-100, 115 mL glycerol, 308 mg Dithiothreitol, 4.45 g Na2HP04 · 2 H20, 3.03 g TRIS HCI, ad II H20, pH 7.8) was added as equal volume to the compound solution on the cells to determine luciferase expression as a measure of Wnt signaling activity in a luminometer. In order to determine the inhibitory activity of compounds for the WT Wnt signaling pathway, the Super TopFlash vector respectively FOP vector were cotransfected with pcDNA3 into ΗΕΚ293 and stable transfected ΗΕΚ293 cells were isolated by antibiotic selection. In preparation of compound testing, a dose response curve for the Wnt dependent luciferase expression was recorded by stimulating the assay cells with human recombinant Wnt-3a (R&D, #5036-WN-010) at different concentrations for 16 hours at 37°C and 5% C02 followed by subsequent luciferase measurement as described above to determine the Wnt-3a EC50 for the ΗΕΚ293 TOP cell line on the day of testing. The recombinant human Wnt-3a was thereby used between 2500 and 5 ng/ml in two-fold dilution steps. To determine the inhibitory activity of compounds on the WT Wnt pathway they were prepared and diluted as described above for the constitutive active Wnt pathway and coincubated with the EC5o concentration of Wnt-3a for 16 hours at 37°C and 5% C02 on the ΗΕΚ293 TOP respectively control ΗΕΚ293 FOP cells. Measurement of luciferase expression was done as described for the constitutive active Wnt assay.

W02011/035321A1) which is less selective than the compounds of the present invention. Some of the compounds of general formula (I) show low solubility in aqueous media and organic solvents. This can affect the possibility to assess the activity of such compounds with the described assays. For example, the IC5o value we determined for 4-methoxy-3-[(morpholin-4-ylacetyl)amino]-N(5-phenyl-l,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)benzamide in the HCT116 TOPFIash assay was higher than expected. But it turned out that the solubility of this compound was determined to be lower than 0.1 mg/L or 0.22 pmol/L, respectively in a buffer at ρΗ6.5. Therefore, the high IC5o value of the compound might be a result of the low solubility. Measurement of the inhibitory activity of selected compounds on the Wildtype Wnt signaling cascade In order to discover and characterize small molecules which inhibit the wildtype Wnt pathway, a cellular reporter assay was employed. The corresponding assay cell was generated by transfection of the mammalian cell line FIEK293 (ATCC, #CRL-1573) with the Super TopFlash vector (Morin, Science 275, 1997, 1787-1790; Molenaar et al., Cell 86 (3), 1996, 391-399). The ΗΕΚ293 cell line is cultivated at 37°C and 5% CO2 in DMEM (Life Technologies, #41965-039), supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 20 mM HEPES, 1.4 mM pyruvate, 0.15% Na-bicarbonate and 10% foetal bovine serum (GIBCO, #10270). Stable transfectants were generated by selection with 300 pg/ml Hygromycin. In a parallel approach, ΗΕΚ293 cells were cotransfected with the FOP control vector and pcDNA3. The FOP vector is identical to the TOP construct, but it contains instead of functional TCF elements a randomized, non-functional sequence. For this transfection a stable transfected cell line was generated as well, based on selection with Geneticin (1 mg/ml). In preparation of the assay, the two cell lines were plated 24 hours before beginning the test at 10000 cells per well in a 384 micro titre plate (ΜΤΡ) in 30 μΐ growth medium. Before compound testing a dose response curve for the Wnt dependent luciferase expression was recorded by stimulating the assay cell line with human recombinant Wnt-3a (R&D, #5036-WN-010) at different concentrations for 16 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2 followed by subsequent luciferase measurement, to determine the Wnt-3a EC50 for the ΗΕΚ293 TOP cell line on the day of testing. The recombinant human Wnt-3a was thereby applied between 2500 and 5 ng/ml in two-fold dilution steps. Selective inhibitory activity for small molecules on the wildtype Wnt pathway was determined after parallel incubation of both (TOP and FOP) ΗΕΚ293 reporter cell lines with a compound dilution series from 50 μΜ to 15 ηΜ in steps of 3.16-fold dilutions in CAFTY buffer (130 mM NaCI, 5 mM KCI, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCI2, 5 mM NaHCOs, pH 7.4) containing 2 mM Ca2+ and 0.01% BSA. The compounds were thereby serially prediluted in 100% DMSO and thereafter 50 fold into the CAFTY compound dilution buffer (described above). From this dilution 10 μΐ were added in combination with the EC50 concentration of recombinant Wnt3a to the cells in 30 μΐ growth medium and incubated forhours at 37°C and 5% CO2. Thereafter luciferase assay buffer (1:1 mixture of luciferasebuffer (20 mM Tricine, 2.67 mM MgS04, 0.1 mM EDTA, 4 mM DTT, 270 μΜ Coenzyme A, 470Luciferin, 530 μΜ ATP, ph adjusted to pH 7.8 with a sufficient volume of 5Μ NaOH) and Triton(30 ml Triton Χ-100, 115 ml glycerol, 308 mg Dithiothreitol, 4.45 g Na2HP04 2 Η2Ο, 3.03 g TRIS(CAS Number 1185-53-1), ad II Η2Ο, pH 7.8) was added in an equal volume to determineexpression as a measure of Wnt signaling activity in a luminometer. The Wnt inhibitory activitydetermined as IC50 of resulting dose response curves.

The TaqMan fluorogenic detection system can monitor PCR in real time using a dual-labeled fluorogenic hybridization probe (TaqMan probe) and a polymerase with 5'-3' exonuclease activity. Cells from different cancer cell lines (as HCT116, but not limited to) were grown at 500-1000 cells/well in 384 well cell culture plates. For cell lysis the cell medium was carefully removed. The cells were washed carefully once with 50 pL/well PBS. Then 9.75 pL/well cell lysis buffer (50 mM TRIS HCI pH 8,0, 40 mM NaCI, 1,5 mM MgCh, 0,5 % IGEPAL CA 630, 50mM Guanidium thiocyanate) and 0.25 pL RNASeOUT (40 U/pl, Invitrogen, 10777-019)) per well were added. The plate was incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Then 30 pL DNAse/RNAse-free water per well added and the lysates were mixed. For the One-Step RT-PCR 2 pL lysate (each) was transferred to a 384 well PCR plate. The PCR reaction was composed by 5 pL 2χ One Step RT qPCR MasterMix Plus, 0.05 pL Euroscript RT/RNAse Inhibitor (50 U/pl, 20 U/pl) and 200 ηΜ of the appropriate Primer/Hydrolysis Probe mix (primer sequences of forward, reverse and probe are given below for each analysed gene of interest or house keeping gene). 10 pL water were added per well. Seal the plate with an adhesive optical film. The RT-PCR protocol was setup with 30 min 48°C, then 10 min 95°C followed by 50 cycles of 15 sec 95°C/1 min 60°C and a cooling step of 40°C for 30 sec using a Lightcycler LS440 from Roche. Relative expression was calculated using CP values from the gene of interest (e.g. ΑΧ1Ν2, but not limited to) and a house keeping gene (L32).
