Preparation of (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
(1S,3R)-1-(5-Bromopyridin-2-yl)-2-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (295 mg, 0.73 mmol) in propionic acid (8291 μL) was cooled to −20° C. Sodium nitrite (50.3 mg, 0.73 mmol) in water (829 μL) was added dropwise over 2-3 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred at −20° C. for 45 minutes. The reaction mixture was diluted with ice-cold EtOAc (30 mL). The reaction mixture was poured into saturated NaHCO3 (40 mL). The mixture was stirred vigorously for 5 minutes. The layers were separated and the organic layer was washed with saturated NaHCO3 (2×30 mL). The combined aqueous layers were back extracted with EtOAc (2×30 mL). The combined organic phases were dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated to give the crude product as brown oil. The crude material was purified by flash silica column chromatography eluting with 0-45% EtOAc in heptane to afford (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazlo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (107 mg, 35%) as an orange solid.
