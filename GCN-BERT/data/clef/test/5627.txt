Antibodies Against Human Receptor Integrin Alpha-4 FIELD The invention generally relates to the field of molecular biology, immunology, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and oncology. More specifically, the invention relates to antibodies that bind to human receptor integrin alpha-4. BACKGROUND Alpha4 integrin is among 24 integrin families of cell-adhesion molecules containing noncovalently-associated alpha and beta subunits. Eighteen different integrin alpha subunits and eight different beta subunits have been reported to date in vertebrates, forming at least 24 alpha/beta heterodimers. These varied formations suggest that integrins constitute the most structurally and functionally diverse family of cell-adhesion molecules yet known. Integrins mediate cell-cell and cell extracellular matrix interactions over a wide range of biological contexts. Integrins support force-resistant stable firm adhesion as well as the dynamic adhesive interactions observed in cellular polarization and cell migration. Integrins play a crucial role in many physiological processes, including tissue morphogenesis, inflammation, wound healing, and regulation of cell growth and differentiation. The adhesive and signaling activities carried out by integrins are vital to many of the cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions involved in immune responses. Alpha4 integrin plays a critical role in their adhesive interactions with endothelial cells during migration to lymphoid organs and extravasation to sites of inflammation. Alpha-4 integrin subunit pairs with the betal and beta7, thereby constituting integrin alpha-4-betal (also termed very late antigen-4 or VLA-4) and alpha4-beta7 (also termed lymphocyte Peyer's patch adhesion molecules or LPAM-1) receptors. Alpha4-betal binds to a major endothelial ligand vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), and an extracellular matrix ligand fibronectin (FN) deposited in inflamed tissues, while alpha4-beta7 binds to MAdCAM-1 preferentially expressed in the gut. Alpha4 integrins are known to play crucial roles in tissue-specific leukocyte trafficking to the inflamed brain (alpha4- betal) and to the inflamed gut (alpha4-beta7). Alpha4 integrins are also known to regulate hematopoietic stem cell trafficking and retention in the bone marrow. Persistent accumulation of leukocytes is a hallmark of the chronic inflammation observed in the affected tissues of autoimmune diseases such as Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Crohn's disease. For leukocytes to accumulate within inflamed tissues, they must interact with and subsequently pass an endothelial lining on the inner surface of the vasculature. The leukocyte-endothelial interactions leading to extravasation are regulated by a sequence of multiple steps involving adhesion molecules and chemokine signaling. At inflammatory sites, circulating leukocytes that flow in blood vessels start to tether and roll along endothelial cells via selectins and their ligands. This rolling interaction serves to slow down leukocytes and place them in proximity to the inflamed endothelial cells, thereby enabling these cells to efficiently scan the endothelial surface for available chemokines. While rolling, leukocytes encounter chemokines and become activated via chemokine receptors present on the leukocytes. Chemokine signaling elicits an intracellular signaling cascade that eventually impinges on integrin cytoplasmic domains, thereby triggering integrin activation. Upon activation, global conformational changes occur that rapidly convert a low-affinity latent integrin into a high-affinity ligand-competent state. In this way, the high-affinity integrin mediates the rapid arrest of rolling leukocytes and shear-resistant firm adhesion at inflamed endothelial cells. The cascade of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions was originally thought to contain three steps (i.e., rolling by selectins, activation by chemokines, and upregulation of integrin affinity) before transmigration of leukocytes across the endothelial barrier could occur. A crawling step has recently been added to this cascade. Specifically, leukocytes crawl along the endothelial surface from the point of arrest to that of transmigration. The dynamic regulation of integrin affinity plays a critical role in supporting such leukocyte crawling. During transendothelial migration (TEM), leukocytes proceed through endothelial cells via two distinct routes, either paracellular or transcellular. In the former, leukocytes transmigrate in between adjacent endothelial cells, which usually form tightly sealed junctions, thereby leaving no space between them. During paracellular TEM, the junctions between endothelial cells are dynamically disassembled, thereby creating a gap for a leukocyte to pass through. This gap is closed as soon as the trailing edge of the leukocyte passes beyond it. In contrast, during transcellular TEM, a leukocyte transmigrates through a single endothelial cell. A pore is formed for a leukocyte to move through. The pore formation that develops during transcellular TEM is thought to be mediated by a dynamic remodeling of the endothelial cell-rich plasma membrane that involves vimentin as well as caveolae or vesiculovacuolar organelles. Organ-specific homing of leukocytes is made possible primarily by unique combinations of cell-adhesionmolecules and chemokine receptors. Naive lymphocytes recirculate between the blood stream and peripheral lymphoid tissues, thereby patrolling the body for microorganisms and transformed cells. Gut-tropic effector T cells, which play a pathogenic role in inflammatory bowel diseases, upregulate in integrin alpha-4-beta7 and the chemokine receptor CCR9. Brain-tropic effector T cells, which are responsible for the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, upregulate in integrin alpha-4-betal . Migration of leukocytes from the blood into the central nervous system (CNS) involves multiple events that occur in a defined chronological and spatial order, including rolling, chemoattraction, cell adhesion, and proteolytic degradation of biological membranes. It is thought that slow rolling on endothelial walls allows leukocytes to identify proper arrays of chemoattractants and integrin ligands. Prolonged selectin-mediated rolling of neutrophils and lymphocytes may also lead to integrin activation. Once firmly arrested, integrins serve for leukocytes to bind to other blood-borne leukocytes and platelets. VLA-4 have been shown to facilitate leukocyte migration across the basement membrane of blood vessels, as well as across extracellular matrix (ECM). The interaction of these integrins with ECM may propagate leukocyte immobilization, or bridging between cells. Eventually, VLA-4 integration leads to extravasation of neutrophils and lymphocytes into peripheral tissues and CNS. Thus antibodies that inhibit the interaction between integrin alpha-4 and it's ligand VCAM1 may serve as a therapy for MS and Crohn's disease. MS is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of CNS. Histopatho logically, most acute active MS lesions are characterized by monocytes and lymphocytes infiltration in to the brain. This is considered a critical event in the pathogenesis of MS. Cell adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelial wall has been a major target of drug development against MS. Antibodies against integrin alpha-4 (VLA-4) were the first pharmacological agents that were successfully brought to clinical trials and approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS). Natalizumab (KEGG DRUG: D06886 ) is a humanized anti-integrin alpha-4 monoclonal antibody which under the trade name TYSABRI was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of RR-MS and of Crohn's disease. Currently natalizumab is regarded as the most potent treatment for RR-MS. The scientific rationale for the therapy with antibodies that block integrin alpha-4 is the reduction of leukocyte extravasations into the peripheral tissues, including the brain and the spinal cord by interfering with the physical interaction of VLA-4 with its natural ligands, VCAM-1 and FN. Other indications where antibodies against VLA-4 may provide therapeutic utility include cancer, such as glioblastomas, multiple myeloma, recurring gliomas, recurring breast and other cancer metastasis, as well as fibrosis.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention is based, in part, upon the discovery of antibodies that specifically bind to human integrin alpha-4 (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: P13612) and block interactions with its cognate ligand VCAM-1 (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: PI 9320). The antibodies could be used for a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic applications and as research tools.

Additionally, the functional properties of the abtibodies were tested in a quantitative VCAM-1 adhesion assay. Since the antibodies described herein are engineered on the basis of human sequences, all of them could be administered to humans directly. Depending on a particular application, the described antibodies could be used as targeting moieties for various payloads such as radionuclides, drugs, toxins and other effector molecules. Certain features and aspect of the application of the invention are described in more details below. I - ANTIBODIES AGAINST HUMAN INTEGRIN ALPHA-4 In one aspect, the invention provides for an isolated antibody that specifically binds to human integrin alpha-4. The antibody is comprised of (1) an immunoglobulin light chain variable region comprised of three CDRs and (2) an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region comprised of three other CDRs. The CDRs are embedded into the immunoglobulin framework generated by less variable FR domains. The CDRs of the immunoglobulin light and heavy chain brought together in immunoglobulin molecule define a unique binding site that specifically binds to a native conformation of integrin alpha-4. The terms "binds specifically" or "specifically binds" are interchangeable and mean that binding affinities (EC50 values) of the antibodies described herein are below 50 nM (5* 10~8 M). It is understood that the antibodies can comprise both immunoglobulin heavy and light chain sequences of fragments thereof, such as Fab or Fab2 fragments. It is understood that specific binding and functional properties can be displayed by a full-length intact immunoglobulin or antigen binding fragment thereof or biosynthetic antibody site. It is understood that each of the antibody molecules can be an intact antibody, for example, a monoclonal antibody. Alternatively, the antigen binding could be displayed by an antigen binding fragment of an antibody or can be a biosynthetic antibody binding site. Antibody fragments include Fab, Fab2 or Fv fragments. Techniques for making such antibody fragments are known to those skilled in the art. A number of biosynthetic antibody binding sites are known in the art and include single Fv or sFv molecules, for example as described in US Patent # 5,476,786. Other biosynthetic antibody binding sites include bi-specific or bi-functional antibodies that bind to at least two different target molecules. For example, a bi-specific antibody can bind to human integrin alpha-4 and to another antigen of interest. Methods for making bi-specific antibodies are known in art and include fusing hybridomas or linking Fab fragment together. II - PRODUCTION OF INTEGRIN ALPHA-4 ANTIBODIES Antibodies described in this invention can be produced in different ways utilizing previously developed approaches. For example, DNA encoding variable regions of light and heavy chains can be synthesized chemically using commercially available services and sequence information provided in this invention. Alternatively, the DNA encoding variable regions of heavy and light chains can be amplified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using the original clones of Fab fragments of the antibodies described herein, as templates. Synthetic or PCR-amplified DNA fragments can be genetically fused with appropriate nucleotide sequences to generate full-size antibodies or fragments thereof. Antibody expression constructs can be generated by including immunoglobulin constant region coding sequences, sequences providing expression control and other standard elements of expression systems. Generation of specific gene expression constructs is within ordinary skill in the art. The DNA sequences encoding antibodies of interest can be genetically inserted into expression vectors that can be introduced into host cells using standard transfection of transformation procedures known in the art. Examples of expression approaches include bacterial expression (E. coli) or mammalian expression (Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, HeLa cells, Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells, monkey kidney (COS) cells, Human Embryo Kidney (HEK- 293) cells and myeloma cells that do not produce endogenous immunoglobulins. Transfected or transformed host cells can be propagated under conditions providing expression of genes of interest, such as immunoglobulin light and heavy chains and fragments thereof. The expressed proteins can be harvested using common techniques known in the art. The particular conditions for production of antibodies or fragments thereof vary depending on the expression system utilized. For example, E. co/z'-based expression system is particularly suitable for production of Fab, Fab2 or sFv antibody fragments. The engineered antibody gene is cloned into a vector suitable for bacterial expression downstream from a commonly used bacterial promoters, e.g. T5 of Lac. Genetic fusion of a signal sequence providing targeting on the expressed protein into the periplasm may enable production and accumulation of soluble forms of antibody fragments into the periplasm of bacterial cells. Extraction of proteins of interest and, specifically, of antibody fragments from the periplasm of bacteria is a well-established array of standard methods known in the art. If the antibodies are produced in mammalian expression systems, DNA coding sequences must be inserted into appropriate expression vectors containing adequate eukaryotic promoter, signal peptide for secretion from the cells and other genetic elements known in the arts. Mammalian expression systems are particularly suitable for production of full-size immunoglobulins. One of the approaches for antibody production is transient co-expression of heavy (variable + constant) and light (variable + constant) chains of immunoglobulin genetically introduced into two separate expression vectors. Another approach for antibody production is expression on both heavy and light chains from a single bi-cistronic vector. Alternatively, stable cell lines constitutively expressing both heavy and light chains can be generated using single vector approach or utilizing two-vector systems. Alternative approaches for antibody production include expression in yeast (P. Pastoris or similar strains) or plant cells. Each expression system requires generation of host-specific genetic constructs and generation of expression constructs is very similar to described above bacterial and mammalian expression systems. It is understood that regardless of the expression system utilized for production of antibodies of fragments thereof, the protein sequence of each antibody remains the same and directly corresponds to the sequence of this invention. It is also understood that DNA sequence may be altered, for example, by the process known as codon optimization that provides higher protein production, depending on host-specific codon usage. It is understood that during the process of generation of expression constructs for antibodies and fragments thereof, various genetic modifications can be introduced. For example, epitope or purification tags or peptide and protein toxins can be genetically fused to the expression constructs encoding heavy chain, light chain or combination of both immunoglobulin chains. III - MODIFICATIONS OF INTEGRIN ALPHA-4 ANTIBODIES It is understood that the antibodies disclosed herein can be modified to improve performance which largely depends on the intended use. For example, if used as therapeutic agent, the antibody can be genetically modified to reduce its immunogenicity in the intended recipient. Additionally, or as an alternative, the antibody can be genetically fused or coupled to another peptide or protein, such as epitope tag, purification tag, a growth factor, cytokine or natural or modified toxin. These modifications can be readily achieved by utilizing genetic manipulations known in the art. IV - USE OF INTEGRIN ALPHA-4 ANTIBODIES The integrin alpha-4 -specific antibodies described herein can be used as therapeutic agents, and diagnostic agents or as reagents for basic and applied research and development. (1) Therapeutic Applications Because the antibodies in the invention specifically bind to human integrin alpha-4 and block interactions with its cognate ligand VCAM-1, they can be utilized in a variety of therapeutic applications. It is contemplated that the antibodies of the invention can be used for the treatment of a variety of disorders in which integrin alpha-4 mediated signaling is involved. This includes autoimmune disorders, such as Multiple Sclerosis, Crohn's desease and alike, as well as various types of cancers, such as glioblastomas, multiple myeloma, recurring gliomas, recurring breast and other cancer metastasis. (2) Diagnostic Applications Whenever the antibodies are used for diagnostic purposes, either in vivo or in vitro, the antibodies are typically modified directly or indirectly with a detection moiety. The detection moiety is a functional addition to the antibody that can be detected either directly or indirectly or is capable of generating a detectable signal. For example, the detectable moiety can be a 125 32 14 radionuclide ( Iodine, Phosphorus, Carbon or others), fluorescent or chemiluminescent compound, such as fluorescein, rhodamine or luciferine. Enzyme moieties include alkaline phosphatase, horse radish peroxidase, beta-galactozidase and others. Methods for conjugation of the detection moieties largely depend on the nature of the moiety and routinely can be reproduced by those experienced in the art. The antibodies of the invention can be used in a broad range of immunological techniques know in the art. Examples of such techniques include sandwich immunoassays (ELISA), competitive immunoassays, cell surface staining procedures combined with FACS analysis, immunocyto- and immunohistochemical procedures. Protocols and method all of these procedures and assays are well-established and can be routinely carried out by those skilled in the art. EXAMPLES The following examples illustrate selection, identification and characterization of a number of fully human recombinant antibodies against human integrin alpha-4 receptor.

Isolation of antibodies that recognize native conformations of integrin alpha-4 is absolutely critical for the development of such antibodies as therapeutics. In the human body and tissues integrin alpha-4 is present in its native form, therefore only the antibodies that bind to the native receptor have practical utility. Preparation of antigen-presenting platforms that provide oriented and functional receptor in its native conformation is far from being trivial. Many methods of antibody generation, for example generation of antibodies against peptide epitopes or receptor fragments, usually are not successful for complex targets such as integrin alpha-4. Previously patented technology that relies on the generation of magnetic proteoliposomes (MPLs) (Sodroski, J.G. and T. Mirzabekov, Proteoliposomes containing an integral membrane protein having one or more transmembrane domains; US Patent 6,761,902;) has been used for isolation of antibodies against integrin alpha-4. The main advantage of the core technology that relies on usage of MPLs is the ability to present highly purified and concentrated antigen (human integrin alpha-4 in this invention) properly oriented and, most importantly, in its native conformation and functional state. Although the technology disclosed in US Patent 6,761,902 can be applied to a variety of complex membrane proteins, each target requires extensive optimization of protein extraction and MPL formation conditions. Prior to preparing MPL particles, a stable cell line was prepared, utilizing established protocols, overexpressing human recombinant integrin alpha-4. The condition for extraction of human integrin alpha-4 were tested and optimized prior to the initiation of the antibody selection procedure. An extensive matrix of combinations of various detergents, salts and buffer components was analyzed to identify conditions providing a balance between effective extraction of the integrin alpha-4 and retaining of its function and native conformation. The integrin alpha-4 functionality was tested by assaying binding of its ligand, VCAM-1, to the integrin alpha-4 immobilized on the surface of the MPLs. Stability of the MPL particles (as judged by VCAM-1 and Tysabri (natalizumab)) binding was also tested to ensure that the native conformation of the integrin alpha-4 is retained for the duration of the antibody selection protocol. Example 2 - Antibody libraries and selection of anti-integrin alpha-4 antibodies. Selection of human integrin alpha-4-specific antibodies was carried out from antibody libraries encoding a series of fully human Fab antibody fragments consisting of 1010 - 1011 independent antibody clones. Randomization of all three CDRs (CDRl, CDR2 and CDR3) was carried out for the heavy chain of Fab fragments. Randomization of CDR3 was carried out for the light chain of Fab fragments whereas CDRl, CDR2 were kept invariant. A phage display library represents a collection of individual phage particles that express only a certain type of a genetic fusion of an individual Fab antibody fragment with a surface protein intrinsic for this particular type of phage. A fraction of the phage display library usually containing 1012-1013 phage particles is used as a primary source of the antibody variety. A fraction of the phage display library (1012-1013 phage particles) was incubated with MPL preparations containing functional integrin alpha-4 in its native conformation. The phage particles that did not bind to the integrin alpha-4-MPLs were removed by a series of subsequent washes under conditions providing retention of the native conformation of integrin alpha-4. The pool of phage particles that was bound to integrin alpha-4-MPLs was removed by acidic elution. The deconvo luted phage output (usually 106-108 phage particles) was harvested and further amplified by propagation in E. coli. The pool of the amplified phage is then used further for the second selection round as described for the first round above. A minimum of 2 and maximum of 4 selection rounds are carried out for a standard selection procedure. Example 3 - Screening of anti-integrin alpha-4 antibodies. This example describes a procedure for screening antibodies specific against native conformations of integrin alpha-4 receptor. The screening procedure is based on the usage of live cells expressing human integrin alpha- 4 receptor on their surface. Generation of stable cell lines expressing integrin alpha-4 is described in Example 6 below. R1610 cells expressing integrin alpha-4 were used for screening. Phage outputs from 3rd or 4th selection rounds represented pools of page particles that were used to infect E. coli to produce phagemid DNA. The phagemid DNA was digested with Nhel and BstEII to excise the entire Fab fragment and further introduced (ligated) into pQE3-Kan expression vector (Quiagen) digested with the same restriction enzymes, Nhel-BstEII. The resulting genetic construct was suitable for expression of Fab antibody fragment in bacteria under control of T5 promoter. Pool of pQE3-Kan vector with inserted Fab fragments was used for transformation of E. coli. The individual colonies resulting from the transformation were picked up and propagated in 96- well plates. Expression of Fab fragments was induced by IPTG and the expressed protein was harvested using standard biochemical approaches know to those in the art. Each well of 96-well plate containing single Fab clone was harvested separately and used further for binding property testing. A minimum of 500 and maximum of 50,000 individual clones were usually analyzed in the screening procedure. The cells expressing human integrin alpha-4 were mixed with individual Fab preparations and allowed to interact for 30 min at 4°C. Unbound material was removed by pelleting the cells and by aspirating the supernatant. Binding the Fab antibody fragments to the cells was analyzed by secondary antibodies conjugated to phycoerythrin. The antibody binding was quantified by FACS analysis using 96-well plate compatible Guava flow cytometer. Clones that gave increase of the signal >5 fold over the background were scored as positive and kept for further analysis. The antibody clones that bound to integrin alpha-4 were re-tested for their ability to interact with parental cells that did not express integrin alpha-4 in order to identify specific integrin alpha- 4 binders. The test was performed as described above and the final candidates from the screening had the following properties: they bind to the integrin alpha-4-expressing cells but not the integrin alpha-4-negative parental cells. Example 4 - Sequencing of anti-integrin alpha-4 antibodies. The candidate Fab antibody clones identified in Example 3 were subjected to a sequencing analysis to identify independent clones. Bacterial cultures were submitted to Beckman Genomics automated sequencing facility. The experimental sequencing data were analyzed by appropriate software, specifically the nucleic acid sequences were aligned to identify identical clones and to determine the differences in the deduced protein sequences. For example, variable regions can be identified using IMGT/V- QUEST webserver-based software at http:/y\vwwamgt.org,'1M n^_vquest/share/textes/. The sequencing analysis enabled detection of clones with identical sequences and only clones with unique and distinct DNA and protein sequences were kept for further evaluation. Of several initially identified antibodies a single antibody, designated IN 10, was selected for further optimization by affinity maturation, which included scanning mutagenesis of CDRs in the heavy chain and the light chain on antibody IN 10. Every position in the IN 10 CDRs was substituted with one of 18 aminoacids (all natural L-aminoacids, except Met and Cys) and inhibitory properties of the mutant antibodies were assessed as described in Example 8 below. Unexpectedly, several single aminoacid substitutions significantly improved IN 10 affinities. Some of the best single mutations we then combined into double mutants, some of which showed further improvements. The best IN10 heavy chain single mutants are designated Y32N, T50W and T50V, while double mutants are designated Y32NT50W and Y32NT50V. The complete heavy chain variable regions of the best heavy chain mutants are shown in a sequence alignment presented in Figure 2, while a sequence alignment of their heavy chain CDRs is presented in Figure 3. The best IN10 light chain mutants are designated VK1, VK2, VK3, VK4, VK5 and VK12. The complete light chain variable regions of the best light chain mutants are shown in a sequence alignment presented in Figure 4, while a sequence alignment of their light chain CDRs is presented in Figure 5. The IN 10 heavy chain and the best heavy chain IN 10 mutants were then combined with the IN 10 light chain and the best IN 10 light chain mutants to produce fully human antibodies on the IgGl frame, as described in the Examples below. Thus obtained antibodies were assed for their inhibitory properties and the best candidates were also produced on the IgG4 frame (CHI, CH2 and CH3 from human IgG4), or a mixed IgGl/4 frame (CHI from IgGl, while CH2 and CH3 from IgG4), and their binding properties were also assessed. In order to create a complete heavy chain and light chain immunoglobulin sequences, the variable region of the sequences shown below are combined with the corresponding constant region sequences. Signal peptides are not presented in the sequence; each sequence starts from the actual beginning of the antibody molecule according to Kabat numbering system. IN10 Variable Region, Heavy Chain (Seq.

This Example describes design and generation of expression constructs for inducible expression of human integrin alpha-4 receptor. In particular, this example describes epitope and purification tags genetically fused to the nucleic acid sequences encoding integrin alpha-4 and its orthologs. Human integrin alpha-4 receptor (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_000885.4) was amplified by PCR using Clone ID HsCD00446160 (DNASU Plasmid Repository) as a template. To the coding sequence of integrin alpha-4, Nhel restriction site for cloning purpose and Kozak sequence was genetically fused upstream of the starting native ATG codon using IA-003 Direct primer. The endogenous native Stop codon of integrin alpha-4 was removed using IA-004 Reverse primer to provide in- frame genetic fusion with Strep-tag (h.ttp://www.iba-go.de/prottoojs/prot_stT ptag.html.. a 8-amino acid peptide tag) and FLAG epitope tag for detection purposes, and Aflll restriction site was introduced for cloning purpose. The PCR product obtained from the reaction using IA-003 and IA-004 primers and human integrin alpha-4 as the template, was Nhel-Aflll digested and cloned into pcDNA3.1-FlagStr vector (Invitrogen). Cloning of pcDNA3.1-FlagStr vector was performed by PCR assembly of the epitope tag: -Link-FLAG-SBP-* (where SBP stands for Streptavidin Binding Peptide) into the cloning site between Aflll and Apal cloning clonig sites. Combining of AC-001 , AC-002 'structural' primers and AC-003 and AC-004 direct and reverse PCR primers was required for assembly of the tag.

The expression constructs encoding human integrin alpha-4 receptor described in Example 5 were used for generation of stable cell lines. Commercially available cell lines, R1610, Cf2Th and HEK-293 (ATCC) were used. The expression constructs were verified for the expression of the protein of interest in a transient transfection experiment and then the cells were propagated on a medium containing Zeocin to select for stable cell lines harboring the gene of interest. Expression of the integrin alpha-4 was verified by Western blot and by FACS analysis to ensure that the expressed protein was translocated to the plasma membrane. For both techniques, commercially available antibodies were used. All steps of the cell line generation were carried out according to the manufacturers' protocols. Example 7 - Conversion of the Fab antibody fragments into immunoglobulins and their production. This Example provides description an approach for subcloning of Fab fragments into mammalian expression vectors for production of fully functional immunoglobulins. A protein production approach is also provided herein. The candidate Fab antibody Heavy Chain variable region fragments described in the foregoing Examples 2-4 were converted into full size immunoglobulins of IgGl framework. Variable region of the heavy chain was fused to the constant region of human IgGl isotype using expression vector pTT-5 (NRC Biotechnology Research Institute, National Research Council of Canada) modified by introducing the constant region of human IgGl from pFUSE-CHIg-hGl expression vector (Invivogen) resulting in pTT-IgGl-HC vector.

CHO-3E7 cells provided by NRC Biotechnology Research Institute, National Research Council of Canada, were diluted to 0.8 xlO6 cells/ml 24 h before transfection. On the day of transfection cell density was adjusted to 2.0 to 2.2xl06 cells/ml using complete FreeStyle™ CHO medium and cell viability was greater than 97%. The working solution of Polyethylenimine (PEI) was prepared as follows. To the 450 ml Milli-Q water, 1500 mg PEI "MAX" was added and stirred until complete dissolution and a final concentration of 3 mg/ml. The initial pH of the solution was around 2.2 and then it was adjusted to pH 7.0 by NaOH. The final pH adjustments were made using HC1 and/or NaOH. The final volume of the solution was adjusted to 500 ml, filter-sterilize using a 0.22 μιη membrane and stored at -20°C. Polyethylenimine ' 'MAX' ' linear, MW 25 kDa (40 kDa nominal), 3 mg/ml stock solution in water, pH 7.0 (Polysciences Inc. cat# 24765-2) was mixed with purified and quantified plasmid DNA of interest. A260/A280 ratio (use 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 to dilute the plasmid DNA) was between 1.85 and 1.95. The cells were used in exponential growth phase, 2-2.2xl06 cells/ml in CHO FreeStyle medium. DNA preparations (0.75mg/L) encoding for Heavy or Light chains of immunoglobulin were mixed with PEI in CHO FreeStyle medium at 1 :5 (w:w) ratio, the mixture was then incubated 8-10 min, add then added to culture. Volume of the transfection mixture was 1/10 of the final volume of the production culture. Procedures for production of antibodies on IgG4 framework or the hybrid IgGl/4 framework were essentially similar to the one described above for IgGl framework. Variable Region of heavy chain was fused to the constant region of human IgG4 isotype using expression vector pTT-5 (NRC Biotechnology Research Institute, National Research Council of Canada) modified by introduction of the constant region of human IgG4 from pFUSE-CHIg-hG4 expression vector (Invivogen) resulting in pTT-IgG4-HC. Alternetively for IgGl/4 hybrid variable Region of heavy chain was fused to the constant region of a hybrid human IgGl (CHI) - IgG4 (CH2-CH3) isotype using expression vector pTT-5 (NRC Biotechnology Research Institute, National Research Council of Canada) modified by introduction of the CHI constant region of human IgGl from pFUSE-CHIg-hGl expression vector (Invivogen) and CH2-CH3 constant regions of human IgG4 from pFUSE-CHIg-hG4 expression vector (Invivogen) resulting in pTT-IgGl/4-HC. Routinely, expression level for various immunoglobulins was from 20 to 100 mg/L. The immunoglobulin production was monitored by commercially available ELISA kit (Bethyl Laboratories). Purification of immunoglobulin preparations was carried out as follows. Tris-Gly cine-Native Buffer, lOx, pH 8.5 (Boston Bioproducts; Cat# BP- 160) was added to the supernatant (1/10 volume/volume) containing IgG at a final concentration of 20-100 mg/L and gently mixed. The supernatant volume was evenly distributed into 50-ml centrifuge tubes, 50ml per tube. Protein A Plus Agarose (Pierce, Cat. # 22812), a wet pellet, was used at 1/100 ratio to the total volume of the supernatant material. The appropriate amount of Protein A Plus Agarose was incubated with the IgG-containing supematants at an orbital shaker for overnight. After the incubation, the Protein A Plus Agarose resin was harvested and placed into 15 -ml columns (Pierce) and then washed with 10 volumes of lx PBS, then with 10 volumes of 25mM Tris-HCl, 0.12M Glycine, 1.5M NaCl (pH 8.5), then with 10 volumes of TBS-Tween-20, then with 10 volumes of 20mM Sodium Citrate Buffer, 1M NaCl (pH 5.5) and the final wash with 10 volumes of 150mM Sodium Chloride without any buffer. The elution of bound immunoglobulins was carried out with Elution Buffer (0.1 M Glycine pH 3.0, 10% Sucrose, 150mM NaCl) that was added at ratio of 1 : 1 to the volume of Protein A Plus Agarose resin. The elution buffer was incubated with the Protein A Plus Agarose resin for 3 min, removed and then another portion of fresh Elution Buffer was added to the Protein A Plus Agarose resin. The eluted material was immediately neutralized by 0.5 M Sodium Citrate Buffer, pH 6.0, at the 1/10 volume ratio to the eluted volume. The concentration of the resulting immunoglobulin preparations was determined by measure optical density of the solution at 280nm in UV-transparent cuvettes where a mixture of 0.1 ml of 0.5 M Sodium Citrate, pH 6, with 1ml of the Elution Buffer was used as a Reference Buffer. To calculate the concentration of IgG, the following formula that provides IgG concentration in mg/ml, was used: ^ DilutionF actor . . . [IgG] = OD2m * , where 1.37 is the standard extinction coefficient for an IgG. The purity of thus purified antibodies was over 95%, based on SDS-PAGE coomassie staining. Example 8 - Determination of affinities of integrin alpha-4 antibodies This example describes the method for determination of the affinities of the antibodies against human integrin alpha-4 receptor and provides means of comparison of properties of different antibody clones. Determination of EC50 values for the antibodies against Integrin alpha-4 was performed using cells overexpressing human integrin alpha-4. The antibody at various concentrations (from 0.001 nM to 500 nM) was allowed to interact with the indicated cell lines and then the binding of the antibody to the cells was revealed by fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. The stained cells were analyzed by FACS where Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) was measured. The binding curves for several representative antibodies of the present teachings are shown in Figure 6. The obtained data were analyzed utilizing GraphPad Prism 5.0 software and EC50 values were calculated using antagonistic 4-parameter curve fit algorithm. Determination of IC50 values for the antibodies against Integrin alpha-4 was performed using cells overexpressing human integrin alpha-4. VCAM-1 was coated onto a protein binding 96-well plate by overnight incubation at lOug/ml concentration in PBS buffer. The plate was washed 3 times with PBS. At the same time KA4 cells (K562 cells overexpressing Integrin alpha- 4) (5xl03 per well) were mixed with appropriate antibodies on a 96-well plate. Antibodies were added at various concentrations (from 0.001 nM to 500 nM) and incubated for 30 minutes with the KA4 cells. The antibody-cell mix were transferred onto the VCAM-1 coated plate and incubated overnight at 37°C. Cell attachment was monitored both, by microscope visualization, and by MTT assay. Functional antibodies including natalizumab (Tysabri) as control inhibited binding of the cells to the VCAM1 coated plate. For the MTT assay unbound cells were removed by washing three times with PBS. Washing efficiency was monitored using a microscope. The cells that remained attached to the VCAM-1 coated plate were analyzed using the MTT assay for colorimetric analysis and quantitation. Background binding was assessed using BSA-coated wells and subtracted from the experimental values. As a positive control commercially available comparator anti- integrin alpha-4 antibody - natalizumab was used. The obtained data were analyzed utilizing GraphPad Prism 5.0 software and IC50 values were calculated using antagonistic 4-parameter curve fit algorithm. The results of the analysis for the antibodies that demonstrated superior affinities are summarized in Table 1.

As is apparent from the table, most of the antibodies produced exhibit superior affinities that the commercially available natalizumab, with some exhibiting up to an order of magnitude higher affinities. Example 9 - Biophysical characterization of the anti-integrin alpha4 antibodies In vitro stability of representative antibodies of the present invention was assessed utilizing several biophysical methods, including Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Circular Dichroism. Thermal stability of the antibodies was assessed by DLS technique. Dynamic light scattering (also called photon correlation spectroscopy or quasi-elastic light scattering) is a method that is broadly used in the development of MAB therapeutics for detecting antibody oligomerization. Large protein (di-, tri-, and other multimer) particles exhibit long decay times and contribute more significantly to the overall light scattering intensity compared to small particles, e.g. a monomeric form of a MAB. DLS allows picking up signals arising from small populations of protein oligomers among a highly concentrated monomeric form. On the other hand, in the case of presence of even a relatively low concentration of aggregated protein forms the light scattering arising from a monomeric protein is often lost in the strong contribution of aggregates. To prevent this effect, all protein solutions to be studied by DLS are thoroughly filtrated prior to analysis. Two sets of the studies were performed on representative antibodies of the present teachings - one on freshly isolated and stored at 20° C; and the other - on the same antibodies after 6 hour incubation at 50° C. Tysabri was used as a comparator antibody. Prior to conducting measurements, the antibodies were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. DLS measurements were carried out using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, UK) system. The backscattered light from a 4 mW He-Ne 632.8 nM laser was collected at an angle of 173°. Protein concentration was about 0.15 mg/ml. Buffer conditions were as follows: 10 mM phosphate, 70 mM NaCl, 29 mM sucrose, pH 6.1. Prior to experiments solutions were passed through 0.1 μιη Whatman® Anotop® 10 syringe filter. Sample temperature was kept at 25.0°C. The acquisition time for a single autocorrelation function was 70 s. The resulting autocorrelation functions were calculated using averaged values from two measurements. The results of the measurements are presented in Figure 7. As is apparent from the DLS studied, all the antibodies tested exhibit nearly identical distributions of their hydrodynamic diameters, none of the antibodies form multiple molecule aggregates in solution and thus are aggregationally stable. The secondary structure analysis of representative antibodies of the present invention was performed by circular dichroism. Circular dichroism refers to the difference in absorption of left and right circularly polarized light. Each of the protein secondary structure types possesses its own characteristic CD spectrum. The CD spectrum of protein under study is deconvoluted into components corresponding to the contributions from different secondary structure types. Since antibodies are characterized by very high content of β-pleated sheets, their CD spectra closely resemble those for pure β-strand structure. The experiment was performed in similar conditions as DLS: one on freshly isolated and stored at 20° C; and the other - on the same antibodies after 6 hour incubation at 50° C. Figure 8 shows far-UV CD data for representative antibodies of the present teachings, alongside with Tysabri, all formulated in 10 mM phosphate, 70 mM NaCl, 29 mM sucrose, -0.007% NaN3, pH 6.1. Protein concentration used was between 0.9-1.2 μΜ. CD studies were carried out utilizing a J-810 spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Inc.), equipped with a Peltier-controlled cell holder. The instrument was calibrated with an aqueous solution of d-10- camphorsulfonic acid. The cell compartment was purged with nitrogen. A quartz cell with a path length of 1 mm was used. Buffer contribution was subtracted from experimental spectra. Bandwidth was 2 nm, averaging time - 2 s, and accumulation - 3. The CD spectra for several representative antibodies of the present teachings are shown in Figure 8. Measured CD data indicates that all antibodies studied are characterized by predominance of β-sheets, while closely resembling the spectra of Tysabri.
