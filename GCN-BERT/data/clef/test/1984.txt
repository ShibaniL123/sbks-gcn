Step 1. (S)-3-Bromo-N-(1-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide
To a mixture of (S)-2-aminopropan-1-ol (55.7 mg, 0.742 mmol, Aldrich) and triethylamine (0.16 mL, 1.1 mmol) in DCM (4.0 mL) at 0° C. was added dropwise a solution of 3-bromo-4-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (100.0 mg, 0.371 mmol, Enamine) in DCM (2.0 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for one hr at 0° C. Solvent was removed in vacuo and the product was purified by flash chromatography, eluting with a gradient from 0-17% EtOAc in hexanes to afford a colorless oil (0.096 g, 84%). LCMS for C10H15BrNO3S (M+H)+: calculated m/z=308.0; found 307.9.
