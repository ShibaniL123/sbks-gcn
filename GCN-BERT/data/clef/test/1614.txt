New polymorphs and new solid states of Tiacumicin B The present invention relates to new polymorphs and new solid states of Tiacumicin B. Tiacumicin B can be produced as disclosed in US4918174 or WO2004014295. There are several publications mentioning various polymorphs and crystals related to tiacumicins e.g. US8722863, US7863249, US8518899, CN103275153, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans, by Arnone and Nasini, 1987, page 1353-1359. The following background is based on Florence et al, Physiochemical Principles of Pharmacy, 5th edition, August 201 1 : The physical properties of the solid state seen in crystals and powders of both drugs and pharmaceutical excipients are of interest because they can affect both the production of dosage forms and the performance of the finished product. Crystalline solids can exist in several subphases, such as polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, and cocrystals. Polymorphs are different crystalline forms (at different free energy states) of the same compound. On the other hand, solvates, hydrates and co-crystals are similar in that they comprise a stoichiometric or significant amount of an additional compound. E.g., a drug together with an organic solvent (to form a solvate) or water (to form a hydrate), or another crystalline solid (to form co- crystals). Both types of compounds participate in the short-range and long-range orders of the crystal and therefore these subphases are regarded as single crystalline forms consisting of two types of molecules. The nature of the crystalline form of a drug substance may affect its stability in the solid state, its solution properties and its absorption. The solid state is important for a variety of reasons: morphology, particle size, polymorphism, solvation or hydration can affect filtration, flow, tableting, dissolution and bioavailability. The crystals of a given substance may vary in size, the relative development of the given faces and the number and kind of the faces (or forms) present; that is, they may have different crystal habits. The habit describes the overall shape of the crystal in rather general terms and includes, for example, acicular (needle-like), prismatic, pyramidal, tabular, equant, columnar and lamellar types. A more fundamental difference in properties may be found when the compounds crystallise as different polymorphs. When polymorphism occurs, the molecules arrange themselves in two or more different ways in the crystal; either they may be packed differently in the crystal lattice or there may be differences in the orientation or conformation of the molecules at the lattice sites. These variations cause differences in the X-ray diffraction patterns of the polymorphs and this technique is one of the main methods of detecting the existence of polymorphs. The polymorphs have different physical and chemical properties; for example, they may have different melting points and solubilities and they also usually exist in different habits. Polymorphism is common with pharmaceutical compounds, but predictability of the phenomenon is difficult. Its pharmaceutical importance depends very much on the stability and solubility of the forms concerned. It is difficult, therefore, to generalise, except to say that where polymorphs of insoluble compounds occur there are likely to be biopharmaceutical implications. The term "polymorph" as used herein is meant to embrace crystalline solid states of a pure compound including solvates, co-crystals and crystals. However, polymorphs also have different crystal lattices and consequently their energy contents may be sufficiently different to influence their stability and biopharmaceutical behaviour. The most important consequence of polymorphism is the possible difference in the bioavailability of different polymorphic forms of a drug; particularly when the drug is poorly soluble. The rate of absorption of such a drug is often dependent upon its rate of dissolution. The most stable polymorph has the lowest solubility and slowest dissolution rate and consequently often a lower bioavailability than the metastable polymorph. It has been proposed that when the free energy differences between the polymorphs are small there may be no significant differences in their biopharmaceutical behaviour as measured by the blood levels they achieve. When some compounds crystallise they may entrap solvent in the crystal. Crystals that contain a solvent as part of the crystal lattice are called crystal solvates, or crystal hydrates when water is the solvent of crystallisation. Crystals that contain no water of crystallisation are termed anhydrates. Crystal solvates exhibit a wide range of behaviour depending on the interaction between the solvent and the crystal structure. With some solvates the solvent plays a key role in holding the crystal together; for example, it may be part of a hydrogen-bonded network within the crystal structure. These solvates are very stable and are difficult to desolvate. When these crystals lose their solvent they may collapse and re-crystallise in a new crystal form. We can think of these as polymorphic solvates. In other solvates, the solvent is not part of the crystal bonding and merely occupies voids in the crystal. These solvates lose their solvent more readily and desolvation does not destroy the crystal lattice. Certain impurities can inhibit the growth pattern and favour the growth of metastable polymorphs. Impurities in a crystallization process have been found to have vast effects on the morphology of the resulting crystal, with both beneficial and detrimental effects possible for the resultant product. Impurities occur because materials are never 100% pure. An impurity compound can often be incorporated at a regular site in the crystal structure.

The various aspects and more of the present invention, including various embodiments, will be described in further detail, with reference to the detailed description, examples and appended drawings. Detailed description of the invention According to one embodiment, Tiacumicin B can be produced by fermentation of Dactylosporangium aurantiacum subspecies hamdenensis NRRL 18085 or Actinoplanes deccanensis ATCC 21983. The term "polymorph" as used herein is meant to embrace crystalline solid states of a pure compound including solvates, co-crystals and crystals. A "pure compound" as used herein is meant to cover compounds with a HPLC purity of at least 95%, or more preferred at least 97% and even more preferred at least 99%. A "crystal solvate" as used herein is meant to cover polymorphs comprising a significant amount of a solvent relative to the pure compound. By "significant amount of a solvent relative to the pure compound" we mean a molar ratio of solvent : compound from 1 :2 or more. Tiacumicin B is meant to cover the compound represented by the following structure: The term "XRPD" is meant to embrace any method using X-rays for obtaining a diffraction pattern of a solid state material. E.g. a method employing copper Ka radiation wavelength 1.54 A. The methods used herein are described in more detail in the experimental part. A "peak" as used herein concerning XRPD is a relatively sharp rise and fall of the signal between two 2Θ values separated by a maximum of 2 degrees. Most peaks in the XRPDs herein have a relatively sharp rise and fall of the signal between two 2Θ values separated by 1 degree or less. A peak at a specific 2Θ value is to be understood as a peak displaying the highest intensity at this value ± 0.1 degrees. A crystal solvate displaying peaks at 2Θ values x, y and z ± 0.1 means that the pertaining XRPD comprises peaks at x ± 0.1 , y ±0.1 and z ± 0.1. Amorphous Tiacumicin B can be obtained from solutions comprising dissolved Tiacumicin B by a variety of methods well known to the skilled person. E.g adding in an anti-solvent followed by solvent removal, sudden cooling of a saturated solution, freeze drying/lyophilization of the solutions, spray drying of the solutions etc. Solutions comprising dissolved Tiacumicin B can be obtained by dissolving Tiacumicin B of any solid state or by purification of a fermentation broth from Dactylosporangium aurantiacum subspecies hamdenensis NRRL 18085 or Actinoplanes deccanensis ATCC 21983. A "high purity amorphous Tiacumicin material" is a material comprising 97% or more of Tiacumicin B as measured by HPLC and displays a XRPD without any peaks. It can be obtained as described in Example 1. The high purity amorphous Tiacumicin material is hygroscopic with near linear water uptake (see Figure 7C), but it's not deliquescent. The high purity amorphous Tiacumicin material is suitable for storage as demonstrated in example 7 or even longer-term storage. Thus the high purity amorphous Tiacumicin material is relatively stable with respect to crystallization and suitable for long-term storage (e.g storage for 3 months, 6 months, 9 months etc.). A "crystal solvate of Tiacumicin B" is any crystal solvate comprising pure Ticaumicin B. Pure Tiacumicin B as used herein is meant to cover Tiacumicin B with a HPLC purity of at least 95%, or more preferred at least 97% and even more preferred at least 99% by detection at 230 nm. Tiacumicin B can be produced as disclosed in the prior art but is also commercially available (e.g. Bioaustralis Fine Chemicals). The crystalline Tiacumicin B starting material is also commercially available (e.g Brightgene Bio-MedicalTechnology).
