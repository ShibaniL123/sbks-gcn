Step 2. N-(6-Chloroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-8-yl)acetamide
To a solution of 6-chloroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-8-amine (0.25 g, 1.5 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (5 mg, 0.04 mmol) in DCM (10 mL) at 0° C. was added triethylamine (0.63 mL, 4.5 mmol) and then acetic anhydride (0.21 mL, 2.2 mmol). After coming to room temperature, the reaction mixture was stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was again cooled to 0° C. Additional portions of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (7 mg, 0.06 mmol), triethylamine (0.63 mL, 4.5 mmol), and acetic anhydride (0.21 mL, 2.2 mmol) were added. After coming to room temperature, the reaction mixture was stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was diluted with DCM and washed with sat. NaHCO3 (aq), water, and then brine. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography (17-100% EtOAc in hexanes, then 1-10% MeOH in EtOAc) afforded the title compound as a brown solid (0.12 g, 38%). LCMS for C9H9ClN3O (M+H)+: calculated m/z=210.0; found 210.0.
