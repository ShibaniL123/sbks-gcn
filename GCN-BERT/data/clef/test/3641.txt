Step 3. tert-Butyl 3-cyanobicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-ylcarbamate
tert-Butyl (3-carbamoylbicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-yl)carbamate (200.0 mg, 0.884 mmol) in DCM and triethylamine (0.370 mL, 2.65 mmol) at 0Â° C. was treated with trichloroacetyl chloride (0.15 mL, 1.3 mmol). After 30 minutes, additional triethylamine (0.37 mL, 3.0 eq) and trichloroacetyl chloride (0.15 mL, 1.5 eq) were added. After 30 minutes, the reaction was quenched by the addition of sat'd. NaHCO3 solution and the aqueous mixture was extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash chromatography, eluting with a gradient from 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes and ELSD was used to detect the product which was isolated as a white solid (107 mg, 58%).
