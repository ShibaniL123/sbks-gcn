BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION (a) Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a polymerizable liquid crystal compound, a liquid crystal composition including the same, and an optically anisotropic body. (b) Description of the Related Art A phase retarder is a type of optical element changing the polarization state of light passing through the same, and equally said a wave plate. When a light passes through an electromagnetic phase retarder, the polarization direction (direction of electric field vector) becomes a sum of two elements (an ordinary ray and an extraordinary ray) parallel or perpendicular to the optic axis, and changes after passing the phase retarder because the vector sum of two elements varies according to the birefringence and the thickness of the phase retarder. Recently, one of big issues of preparing optical film which can be used to the phase retarder is to prepare a high performance film at a small charge. Because, when liquid crystal compounds having high birefringence are used for preparing an optical film, it is possible to realize the necessary retardation value with small quantity of liquid crystal compounds. And, when such liquid crystal compounds are used, it is possible to prepare a thinner folial film. Therefore, many studies for obtaining the liquid crystal compounds having high birefringence have been carried out actively, but there was a limitation on applying them to the industry in practice because of the orientation problem of the membrane when prior liquid crystal compounds were coated on a film. Particularly, in the case of the liquid crystal compound which is soluble in a specific solvent only, there is a limit to various applications because the kind of films on which the composition including the liquid crystal compound is coated is limited. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Therefore, it is an aspect of the present invention to provide a polymerizable liquid crystal compound having high birefringence and large solubility in various solvents, and showing excellent orientation when it is coated. It is another aspect of the present invention to provide a polymerizable liquid crystal composition including the compound. It is still another aspect of the present invention to provide an optically anisotropic body including the polymer prepared from the polymerizable liquid crystal composition. According to one embodiment of the present invention, a polymerizable liquid crystal compound represented by Chemical Formula 1 is provided: in Chemical Formula 1, A is aldehyde, nitro, or a C1-C5 alkyl sulfone group; D1, D2, G1, and G2 are independently a single bond or a divalent connecting group; E1 and E2 are independently benzene ring or naphthalene ring, and at least one of E1 and E2 is naphthalene ring; J1 and J2 are independently a C1-C10 alkylene group; and L1 and L2 are independently hydrogen or a polymerizable group, where at least one of said L1 and L2 is the polymerizable group. Furthermore, according to another embodiment of the present invention, a polymerizable liquid crystal composition including the compound represented by Chemical Formula 1 is provided. And, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, an optically anisotropic body including a hardened material or polymer of the polymerizable liquid crystal compound is provided. Effects of the Invention The polymerizable liquid crystal compound according to the present invention has not only large solubility in various solvents but also high birefringence and excellent coating orientation, and thus it can provide an optically anisotropic body which is thin but superior in optical properties. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS Hereinafter, the polymerizable liquid crystal compound, the polymerizable liquid crystal composition including the same, and the optically anisotropic body according to the embodiments of the present invention are explained in more detail. Before that, unless there is overt mention about them in the present specification, technical terms used in the specification are just for representing a specific embodiment and they are not intended to limit the present invention. And, the singular words used here include plural meaning unless the words represent apparent opposite meaning. And, the meaning of ‘include’ used in the present specification specifies specific characteristics, territories, essences, steps, motions, elements, or components, and it does not exclude the addition of other specific characteristics, territories, essences, steps, motions, elements, or components. Meanwhile, the ‘polymerizable liquid crystal compound’ is a liquid crystal compound having a polymerizable group, and it is possible to prepare a polymer having a fixed orientation structure of liquid crystal molecules by exposing the compound to an active energy ray after aligning a liquid crystal composition including at least one of the polymerizable liquid crystal compound in a liquid crystal state. The polymer obtained like this shows anisotropy in physical properties such as refractive index, dielectric constant, magnetic susceptibility, modulus, thermal expansion rate, and so on. And, for example, it may be applied to an optically anisotropic body such as a retardation plate, a polarizing plate, a polarizing prism, a brightness enhancing film, a covering material of optical fiber, and so on. And, for example, the properties such as transparency, strength, coatability, solubility, crystallinity, heat resistance, and so on are important besides the anisotropy of the polymer. As the result of repeating studies for the liquid crystal compound, the present inventors found that the polymerizable liquid crystal compound having the chemical structure like the following Chemical Formula 1 has not only high birefringence but also excellent orientation in coating process and makes it possible to prepare an optically anisotropic body having excellent optical properties with thin thickness, and particularly, the compound shows large solubility in various solvents and can be applied more widely, and accomplished the present invention. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the polymerizable liquid crystal compound represented by the following Chemical Formula 1 is provided: in Chemical Formula 1, A is aldehyde, nitro, or a C1-C5 alkyl sulfone group; D1, D2, G1, and G2 are independently a single bond or a divalent connecting group; E1 and E2 are independently benzene ring or naphthalene ring, and at least one of E1 and E2 is naphthalene ring; J1 and J2 are independently a C1-C10 alkylene group; and L1 and L2 are independently hydrogen or a polymerizable group. Since the polymerizable liquid crystal compound according to the present invention has the structure of Chemical Formula 1, it can exhibit basically high birefringence and excellent orientation when it is coated. And particularly, it can exhibit large solubility in various solvents due to the substituent A connected to the center benzene ring. Therefore, the polymerizable liquid crystal compound can be dissolved in a solvent like cyclohexanone and coated on a cycloolefin polymer (COP) film and the like. And, it goes without saying that the compound can be coated on triacetyl cellulose (TAC) film and the like by using common solvents known in the art to which the present invention pertains. According to the present invention, it is advantageous for the realization of said effects that A in Chemical Formula 1 is aldehyde (—CHO), nitro (—NO2), or a C1-C5 alkyl sulfone group (preferably, —SO2CH3, —SO2CH2CH3, and the like).

Furthermore, each of E1 and E2 in Chemical Formula 1 is independently benzene ring or naphthalene ring, preferably at least one of E1 and E2 may be naphthalene ring, and more preferably each of E1 and E2 may be naphthalene ring. And, in Chemical Formula 1, said J1 and J2 may be independently a C1-C10 alkylene group, preferably a C2-C9 alkylene group, and more preferably a C3-C6 alkylene group. And, in Chemical Formula 1, said L1 and L2 may be independently hydrogen or a polymerizable group. Here, the ‘polymerizable group’ can be defined as any cross-linkable or polymerizable functional group such as a unsaturated bond and (meth)acrylate group. According to the present invention, said L1 and L2 may be independently hydrogen, an acrylate, a methacrylate, an epoxy, and so on. Specific examples of the polymerizable liquid crystal compound of Chemical Formula 1 may be represented by the following Chemical Formulae 2a to 2d. In Chemical Formulae 2a to 2d, n may be an integer of 1 to 10. However, the polymerizable liquid crystal compound of the present invention is not limited by or to the following exemplified compounds. Meanwhile, the polymerizable liquid crystal compound represented by Chemical Formula 1 may be prepared by applying a known reaction, and more detailed preparation method will be disclosed in Examples of the present specification. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the polymerizable liquid crystal composition including the compound represented by Chemical Formula 1 is provided.

The composition may further include an arbitrary liquid crystal compound in addition to the compound of Chemical Formula 1, and the arbitrary liquid crystal compound may have a polymerizable property or not. Here, for example, the arbitrary liquid crystal compound may be a liquid crystal compound having an ethylenically unsaturated bond, a compound having an optical active group, a rod-like liquid crystal compound, and the like. At this time, the arbitrary liquid crystal compounds may be mixed with a proper amount according to their structure. Preferably, it is advantageous in the aspect of achieving the object of the present invention that the content of the compound of Chemical Formula 1 is 60 wt % or more per the total monomer weight. The polymerizable liquid crystal composition may further include an additive such as a solvent, a polymerization initiator, a stabilizer, a liquid crystal orientation agent, a dye, a pigment, and so on. The additive may be a common component in the technical field to which the present invention pertains, and the details are not limited. On the other hand, according to still another embodiment of the present invention, an optically anisotropic body including a hardened material or polymer of the polymerizable liquid crystal compound of Chemical Formula 1 is provided. The optically anisotropic body may include a hardened material or polymer in which at least part of the end polymerizable groups of the polymerizable liquid crystal compound of Chemical Formula 1 is addition-polymerized or cross-linked. Specifically, as the optically anisotropic body according to the present invention includes the hardened material or polymer of the polymerizable liquid crystal compound, the light leakage phenomenon can be disappeared or minimized with high retardation value. Furthermore, the optically anisotropic body according to the present invention is thinner than prior laminate type optically anisotropic body and can be prepared by more simplified process.

And, in the process of aligning the polymerizable liquid crystal composition, any known methods can be used, for example, a method of rubbing the composition layer formed or a method of applying a magnetic field or an electric field to the composition layer formed may be used. The thickness of the optically anisotropic body may be adjusted according to its use, and preferably it may be in the range of 0.01 to 100 μm.

And then, the retardation film was prepared by exposing the film to a non-polarized UV from a high pressure mercury lamp of 200 mW/cm2 so as to fixing the oriented state of the liquid crystal. Like above method, the compositions including any one of compounds RM-02 to RM-08 instead of compound RM-01 were prepared, and the retardation films were prepared respectively by using the same. COMPARATIVE PREPARATION EXAMPLES 1˜2 Preparation of Retardation Film The retardation films were prepared substantially according to the same method as in Preparation Examples 1˜8, except that compounds RM-09 and RM-10 were used respectively instead of compound RM-01. REFERENCE EXAMPLE The polymerizable liquid crystal compound (RM 257, made by XI'AN RUILIAN MODERN Co., Ltd) represented by the following Chemical Formula 10 was prepared as the reference example: And, the retardation film was prepared substantially according to the same method as in Preparation Examples 1˜8, except that the compound of Chemical Formula 10 was used instead of compound RM-01. EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 1 Measurement of Solubility of the Compound Concerning compounds RM-01 to RM-08 according to Examples 15˜22, compounds RM-09 and RM-10 according to Comparative Examples 3 and 4, and compound RM 257 according to Reference Example, the solubility in various solvents were measured. At this time, the content of each compound in the solvent was 25 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of total solution. The solubility of the compound was measured and the results are listed in Table 1. In the following Table 1, when the compound was completely dissolved in the solvent and the solution was transparent, it was indicated by ‘◯’; when the compound was dissolved in the solvent but the solution was opaque, it was indicated by ‘Δ’; and when the compound was not dissolved at all, it was indicated by ‘×’. And, the term ‘heated’ in Table 1 means that the solution of room temperature including the compound was heated for about 10 secs by using a heat gun. And, the term ‘TXB’ in Table 1 means the mixed solvent of Toluene:Xylene:Butyl cellosolve=7:2:1 (weight ratio). EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 2 Measurement of Birefringence Quantitative retardation values of the retardation films according to Preparation Examples 1˜8, Comparative Preparation Examples 1˜2, and Reference Example were measured by using Axoscan (made by Axomatrix Co.). At this time, the thickness of the film was independently measured and Δn was calculated from the obtained values. The results are listed in Table 1.

And, even in the case of putting the compounds in toluene and heating the same, just opaque solution was obtained. Furthermore, the compounds were not dissolved in TXB mixed solvent at all. By comparison, compounds RM-01 to RM-08 according to Examples were easily dissolved in toluene at all. And, it was recognized that the compounds were completely dissolved and the solution becomes transparent when the solution was heated. Furthermore, most of the compounds RM-01 to RM-08 according to Examples showed high solubility in cyclopentanone, and they showed high solubility in the TXB mixed solvent particularly. In addition, it was recognized that the retardation films including compounds RM-01 to RM-08 according to Preparation Examples 1˜8 have higher birefringence than the film of Reference Example. 1.
