BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field The present disclosure relates to surgical instruments and, more specifically, to an adaptor to convert rotary input from a handle of a surgical instrument into linear output for a loading unit. 2. Discussion of Related Art As medical and hospital costs continue to increase, surgeons are constantly striving to develop advanced surgical techniques. Advances in the surgical field are often related to the development of operative techniques which involve less invasive surgical procedures which reduce overall patient trauma. In this manner, the length of hospital stays and thus, medical costs can be significantly reduced. One of the truly great advances to reduce the invasiveness of surgical procedures is endoscopic surgery. Endoscopic surgery involves performing surgical procedures through small incisions formed in body walls. There are many common endoscopic surgical procedures, including arthroscopy, laparoscopy (pelviscopy), gastroentroscopy and laryngobronchoscopy, just to name a few. Typically, trocars are utilized for creating incisions through which the endoscopic surgery is performed. Trocar tubes or cannula devices can be extended through the incisions to provide access for endoscopic surgical tools. A camera or endoscope can be inserted through a trocar tube to permit visual inspection and magnification of the body cavity. The surgeon can then perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures at the surgical site with the aid of specialized instrumentation, such as, forceps, cutters, applicators, and the like which are designed to fit through additional cannulas. In many surgical procedures, it is often necessary to suture body organs or tissue. Traditionally, suturing was accomplished by hand using a needle attached to a suture material. This procedure required open access to the tissue to be sutured. Upon the advent of endoscopic surgical procedures, endoscopic suturing instruments have been developed. The development of endoscopic suturing instruments is especially challenging because of the small openings through which the suturing of body organs or tissues must be accomplished. A number of surgical device manufacturers have developed product lines with proprietary powered drive systems for operating and/or manipulating surgical devices. In many instances the surgical devices include a powered handle assembly, which is reusable, and a disposable loading unit or the like that is selectively connected to the powered handle assembly prior to use and then disconnected from the loading unit following use in order to be disposed of or in some instances sterilized for re-use. Loading units for performing suturing procedures, endo-gastrointestinal anastomosis procedures, end-to-end anastomosis procedures, and transverse anastomosis procedures, typically require a linearly driven actuator to actuate the loading unit. As such, these loading units are not compatible with surgical devices and/or handle assemblies that have a rotary driven actuator. In order to make linearly driven loading units compatible with powered surgical devices or handle assemblies that provide a rotary driven actuator, a need exists for adapters or adapter assemblies to interface between and interconnect the linearly driven loading units with the powered rotary driven surgical devices or handle assemblies. SUMMARY In an aspect of the present disclosure, an adaptor for a powered surgical instrument includes a casing, a cam drum, a first linear driver, and a second linear driver. The cam drum defines a longitudinal axis and is translatable between retracted and advanced positions in relation to the casing. The cam drum is supported for rotation about the longitudinal axis and defines first and second radial cam grooves about an outer surface thereof. The first cam groove defines a first profile and the second cam groove defines a second profile. The first linear driver includes a first cam follower disposed in the first cam groove. The first linear driver is supported for movement between advanced and retracted positions in relation to the cam drum along an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis in response to rotation of the cam drum about the longitudinal axis. The second linear driver includes a second cam follower disposed in the second cam groove. The second linear driver is supported for movement between advanced and retracted positions in relation to the cam drum along an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis in response to rotation of the cam drum about the longitudinal axis. In aspects, the adaptor includes a lead screw that is rotatable about the longitudinal axis. The lead screw may be received within a lead screw passage defined by cam drum. Rotation of the cam drum may effect longitudinal translation of the cam drum and the first and second linear drivers along the longitudinal axis. In some aspects, the second cam groove is positioned distal to the first cam groove. In certain aspects, the adaptor includes a cam drum gear that is coupled to the cam drum. Rotation of the cam drum gear may effect rotation of the cam drum. In embodiments, the adaptor includes a middle gear and a cam drum input shaft disposed about axes that are parallel to the longitudinal axis. The cam drum input shaft may be engaged with the middle gear and the middle gear may be engaged with the cam drum gear such that rotation of the cam drum input shaft effects rotation of the cam drum. The middle gear may be in continuous engagement with the cam drum input shaft and the cam drum gear as the cam drum is longitudinally translated between the retracted and advanced positions. In particular aspects, the first and second linear drivers define a first pair of linear drivers. In addition, as the cam drum is rotated, the first and second profiles of the first and second cam grooves translate the first pair of linear drivers through a cycle having four phases of movement. In the first phase of movement, the first and second linear drivers may longitudinally advance in relation to the casing. In the second phase of movement, the first linear driver may be longitudinally fixed in relation to the casing and the second linear driver may longitudinally advance in relation to the casing. In a third phase of movement, the first linear driver may be longitudinally fixed and the second linear driver may longitudinally retract in relation to the casing. In a fourth phase of movement, the first and second linear drivers may both be longitudinally fixed in relation to the casing. In aspects, the adaptor includes a second pair of linear drivers having a third linear driver and a fourth linear driver. The third linear driver may include a third cam follower disposed in the first cam groove. The third linear driver may be supported for movement between advanced and retracted positions in relation to the cam drum along an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis in response to rotation of the cam drum about the longitudinal axis. The fourth linear driver may include a fourth cam follower disposed in the second cam groove. The fourth linear driver may be supported for movement between advanced and retracted positions in relation to the cam drum along an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis in response to rotation of the cam drum about the longitudinal axis. As the cam drum is rotated, the first and second profiles of the first and second cam grooves may translate the second pair of linear drivers through the cycle. The third linear driver may be positioned about the cam drum in opposed relation to the first linear driver and the fourth linear driver may be positioned about the cam drum in opposed relation to the second linear driver. In embodiments, the first, second, third, and fourth cam followers are positioned in the first and second cam grooves such that when the first pair of linear drivers begin the first phase of movement, the second pair of linear drivers is in the fourth phase of movement. In other embodiments, the first, second, third, and fourth cam followers are positioned in the first and second cam grooves such that when the first pair of linear drivers begin the third phase of movement, the second pair of linear drivers begin the first phase of movement. In some aspects, the adaptor includes an articulation assembly having an articulation shaft, an articulation drum, an articulation cam, and an articulation arm. The articulation shaft may extend along an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis and may be engaged with the articulation drum to effect rotation of the articulation drum when the articulation shaft is rotated. The articulation cam may be disposed within the articulation drum. The articulation cam and the articulation drum may be radially fixed relative to one another. The articulation cam may define a proximal camming surface and the articulation drum may define a distal camming surface. The proximal and distal camming surfaces may be helical surfaces. The articulation arm may include an articulation cam follower that is disposed between the proximal and distal camming surfaces. The articulation cam follower may longitudinally translate between a first articulated position, a straight position, and a second articulated position as the articulation drum and the articulation cam are rotated about the longitudinal axis. The straight configuration of the articulation arm may be about halfway between the first and second articulated positions of the articulation arm. In some aspects of the present disclosure, a powered surgical instrument includes a handle, an adaptor, and a loading unit. The handle includes a receiver. The adaptor may be any of the adaptors detailed herein and includes a casing, a handle interface, a cam drum, a first pair of linear drivers, a second pair of linear drivers, and a locking mechanism. The casing has proximal and distal end portions. The handle interface is disposed in the proximal end portion of the adaptor and is releasably coupled to the receiver of the handle. The locking mechanism is positioned adjacent the distal end portion of the casing. The locking mechanism includes a release switch and a lock bar that are operatively associated with one another. The locking mechanism has a locked configuration and an unlocked configuration. The loading unit includes a connector assembly that is releasably secured within the locking mechanism of the adaptor when the locking mechanism is in the locked configuration. In aspects, the handle interface includes a cam drum input shaft that is operatively associated with the cam drum to rotate the cam drum about the longitudinal axis. In some aspects, the adaptor includes a distal cover and an articulation assembly disposed substantially within the distal cover. The distal cover may be disposed over the distal end portion of the casing and may include an articulation shaft, an articulation drum, an articulation cam, and an articulation arm. The articulation shaft may extend along an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis and may be engaged with the articulation drum to effect rotation of the articulation drum when the articulation shaft is rotated. The articulation cam may be disposed within and radially fixed relative to the articulation drum. The articulation cam may define a proximal camming surface and the articulation drum may define a distal camming surface. The articulation arm may include an articulation cam follow that is positioned between the proximal and distal camming surfaces. As the articulation drum and the articulation cam are rotated about the longitudinal axis, the proximal and distal camming surfaces may engage the articulation cam follower to longitudinal translate the articulation arm between a first articulated position, a straight position, and a second articulated position. In embodiments, the locking mechanism includes a lock arm that is operatively associated with the lock bar and the articulation drum may define an articulation lock groove. When the articulation assembly is in the straight position, the articulation interlock groove may be aligned with the lock arm to receive the lock arm. When the articulation assembly is in an articulated position, the articulation interlock groove may be offset from the lock arm to prevent the locking mechanism from transitioning to the unlocked configuration. In particular aspects, the distal end portion of the casing defines a locking opening and a locking groove and the loading unit includes a guide lug. The locking groove receiving the guide lug to align the loading unit with the adaptor. The distal end portion of the casing may define a lug lock in communication with the locking groove and radially offset from the locking groove. When the guide lug is captured in the lug lock, the loading unit may be secured to the adaptor. The lock bar may be disposed within the locking groove. In the locked configuration of the locking mechanism, the lock bar may extend past the lug lock to capture the guide lug in the lug lock. In the unlocked configuration of the locking mechanism, the lock bar may be retracted to a position proximal to the lug lock to allow the guide lug to rotate out of the lug lock. Further, to the extent consistent, any of the aspects described herein may be used in conjunction with any or all of the other aspects described herein.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Embodiments of the present disclosure are now described in detail with reference to the drawings in which like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding elements in each of the several views. As used herein, the term “clinician” refers to a doctor, a nurse, or any other care provider and may include support personnel. Throughout this description, the term “proximal” refers to the portion of the device or component thereof that is closest to the clinician and the term “distal” refers to the portion of the device or component thereof that is furthest from the clinician. Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, an exemplary embodiment of a surgical instrument 10 is provided in accordance with present disclosure including a handle 20, an adaptor 30, and a stitching loading unit 40. The surgical instrument 10 is configured to capture tissue within the stitching loading unit 40, create stitches through the captured tissue with sutures disposed within the stitching loading unit 40, and sever the captured tissue within the stitching loading unit 40. An exemplary embodiment of such a stitching loading unit is disclosed in commonly owned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. XX/XXX,XXX [Atty. Docket No. H-US-04011 (203-9872)], the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The handle 20 is a powered handle and may include one or more drive shafts (not shown) that rotate independently of one another. The handle 20 includes a control interface 22 and a receiver 24. The control interface 22 includes one or more control(s) associated with rotary drive shafts (not shown) within the handle 20 (e.g., an actuator button, a rotate button, a clamp button, a stitch button, etc.). The receiver 24 is supported at the distal end of the handle 20 and includes a recess configured to receive an interface (e.g., a handle interface 50 (FIG. 2) of the adaptor 30) of an adaptor or loading unit (e.g., a connector 44 of the loading unit 40). An exemplary example of such a powered handle is disclosed in commonly owned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/484,975 filed May 31, 2012, and published as U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0253329 on Oct. 4, 2012, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. It is also contemplated that the handle 20 may be a manually driven handle with one or more output shafts. The adaptor 30 converts the rotary motion of the drive shafts of the handle 20 into linear motion of linear drivers 65a-d (FIG. 5) to manipulate the stitching loading unit 40 as detailed below. The stitching loading unit 40 includes a jaw assembly 41 having first and second jaw members 43a, 43b for stitching and severing tissue captured therein, and a connector 44 (FIG. 2) for releasably securing the stitching loading unit 40 to the adaptor 30. With reference to FIG. 3, the handle interface 50 of the adaptor 30 includes a cam drum input shaft 52, a lead screw input shaft 54, an articulation input shaft 56, and an interface 58 supported within the body 50a. Interface 58 is positioned on the proximal end of the adaptor 30. The body 50a of the handle interface 50 is configured to be received within the recess defined in a distal end of the receiver 24 of the handle 20 (FIG. 2). Each of the input shafts 52, 54, 56 is configured to operably engage a respective drive shaft (not shown) of the handle 20 within the receiver 24 such that actuation of the input shafts can be selectively controlled through operation of the handle 20. The handle interface 50 may define one or more interface grooves 51 and include one or more interface protrusions 53 that guide the handle interface 50 into the receiver 24 of the handle 20 and ensure that only compatible adaptors 30 are connectable to particular handles 20. The interface grooves 51 and the interface protrusions 53 may also radially align the handle interface 50 with the handle 20 such that each of the input shafts 52, 54, 56 engages a respective drive shaft of the handle 20. The connector 58 communicates with a receiver (not shown) of the handle 20 to transmit to the handle 20 characteristics of the adaptor 30 and the loading unit 40. These characteristics of the adaptor 30 and the loading unit 40 are provided to a controller (not shown) of the handle 20 such that the handle 20 can be properly operated to control the loading unit 40. The characteristics may include, but are not limited to, the type of loading unit, the manufacturer of the loading unit, the manufacturer of the adaptor 30, the serial numbers of the loading unit or the adaptor 30, the clamping force of the jaw assembly 41, the required torque applied to each of the input shafts 52, 54, 56, the required speed of each of the input shafts 52, 54, 56, and the type of adaptor. The connector 58 may also transmit power or control signals from the handle 20 to the adaptor 30. As shown, the connector 58 is a contact connector; however, it is also contemplated that the connector 58 may be a non-contact connector, e.g., a connector that inductively transfers power or control signals. Referring to FIG. 4, the adaptor 30 includes an outer casing 31, the handle interface 50, a cam drum assembly 60, and an articulation assembly 70. As illustrated, the body 50a of the handle interface 50 extends proximally from a proximal end of the outer casing 31. The articulation assembly 70 includes an articulation drum 72, an articulation drum 74, and an articulation shaft 76. The articulation assembly 70 is positioned adjacent a distal end of the outer casing 31 within a distal cover 36. The distal cover 36 is secured to the distal end surface 37 of the outer casing 31 over a distal end portion 38 of the outer casing 31. The articulation assembly 70 is disposed substantially between the distal end surface 37 of the outer casing 31 and the distal cover 36. With reference to FIGS. 5 and 6, the cam drum assembly 60 includes a cam drum gear 61, a cam drum 62, a plurality of linear drivers 65a-d, and a middle gear 69. The cam drum gear 61 defines a keyed opening 61 a that mates with a raised surface 62a formed at a proximal end of the cam drum 62 to rotatably fix the cam drum gear 61 to the cam drum 62. The cam drum 62 is cylindrical and defines a first or proximal cam groove 63, a second or distal cam groove 64, and a threaded lead screw passage 62b. Each cam groove 63, 64 includes a channel disposed within the outer surface of the cam drum 62 that is configured and dimensioned to receive a cam follower 66 of one of the linear drivers 65a-d to facilitate longitudinal translation of the linear drivers 65a-d as detailed below. Each linear driver 65a-d includes a proximal portion 66a and a linear drive arm 67. The linear drive arm 67 has a distal end which supports an engagement hook 68. The proximal portion 66a supports the cam follower 66 and is configured to mate with adjacent linear drivers 65a-d to substantially enclose the cam drum 62 within the proximal portions 66a of the linear drivers 65a-d as shown in FIG. 6. The proximal portion 66a of each of the linear drivers 65a-d may include mating flanges 66b that slidably engage the mating flanges 66b of the adjacent linear drivers 65a-d to facilitate linear movement of the linear drivers 65a-d in relation to each other along an axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the adaptor 30. As detailed above, the cam follower 66c protrudes from an inner surface of the proximal portion 66a of each of the linear drivers 65a-d and is received within one of the proximal or distal cam grooves 63, 64. The cam followers 66c of adjacent linear drivers 65a-d are positioned within different cam grooves 63, 64 and the cam followers 66c of opposing linear drivers 65a-d are positioned within the same cam grooves 63, 64. As the cam drum 62 is rotated, each cam follower 66c moves within a respective cam groove 63, 64 to effect longitudinal translation of a respective one of the linear drivers 65a-d. The linear drive arms 67 extend distally from the proximal portion 66a of each of the linear drivers 65a-d along the outer surface of the lead screw 55 (FIG. 6). The engagement hook 68 of each of the linear drivers 65a-d is positioned and configured to engage a drive rod of a loading unit (e.g., a drive rod 48 (FIG. 17) of the stitching loading unit 40) as detailed below. Referring also to FIG. 7, the cam drum 62 is supported about the lead screw 55 for rotation and longitudinal translation. More specifically, the lead screw 55 is disposed within the lead screw passage 62b of the cam drum 62. As the lead screw 55 is rotated, the cam drum 62 longitudinally translates between a fully retracted position (FIG. 6) and a fully extended position (FIG. 7). In addition, the cam drum 62 is rotatable via rotation of the cam drum gear 61 to effect longitudinal translation of the linear drivers 65a-d in relation to cam drum 62. The middle gear 69 of the cam drum assembly 60 includes teeth 69a that extends along a length thereof. As the cam drum 62 translates between the fully retracted and extended positions, the middle gear 69 remains in continuous engagement with the cam drum gear 61 such that the cam drum input shaft 52 can effect rotation of the cam drum 62 to effect longitudinal translation of the linear drivers 65a-d at all the longitudinal positions of the cam drum 62. With additional reference to FIG. 8, the cam drum assembly 60 is disposed within the outer casing 31 of the adaptor 30 and the linear drivers 65a-d of the cam drum assembly 60 are rotatably fixed relative to the outer casing 31. The inner surface of the outer casing 31 defines longitudinal alignment grooves 31a that receive the mating flanges 66b of the linear drivers 65a-d to rotatably fix the linear drivers 65 within the outer casing 31. The mating flanges 66b slide within the longitudinal alignment grooves 31a as the cam drum 62 translates between the fully retracted and fully extended positions and as the linear drivers 65a-d are advanced distally in response to rotation of the cam drum 62. When in the fully extended position, the linear drive arms 67 and the engagement hooks 68 extend from the distal end portion 38 of the outer casing 31. Referring now to FIGS. 8-13, the adaptor 30 converts the rotation of the input shafts 52, 54, 56 (FIG. 9) into longitudinal translation of the linear drivers 65a-d, the cam drum 62, and/or the articulation arm 78. The lead screw input shaft 54 engages the lead screw 55 to effect longitudinal translation of the cam drum 62 within the outer casing 31 as detailed above. In embodiments, the lead screw input shaft 54 and the lead screw 55 are integrally formed. When the cam drum 62 longitudinally translates, the mating flanges 66b of the linear drivers 65a-d are disposed within the longitudinal alignment grooves 31a of the outer casing 31 to rotatably fix the linear drivers 65a-d. As detailed above, the cam followers 66c of the linear drivers 65a-d are received within the cam grooves 63, 64 of the cam drum 62 such that upon rotation of the cam drum 62 the linear drivers 65a-d translate longitudinally relative to the cam drum 62 as detailed below. As illustrated, the linear driver 65a and 65b define a first pair of linear drivers and the linear drivers 65c and 65d define a second pair of linear drivers. In this embodiment, the linear drivers of the first pair of linear drivers 65a, 65b are positioned adjacent to one another; however, it is also within the scope of this disclosure for the linear drivers of the first and second pair of linear drivers to oppose one another. The first pair of linear drivers 65a, 65b is associated with components of the first jaw member 43a (FIG. 1) and the second pair of linear driver 65c, 65d is associated with components of the second jaw member 43b (FIG. 1). The cam follower 66c of one of the linear drivers of each pair of linear drivers (e.g., 65a, 65c) is disposed within the distal cam groove 64 and the cam follower 66c of the other one of the linear drivers of each pair of linear drivers (e.g., 65b, 65d) is disposed within the proximal cam groove 63. As the cam drum 62 rotates, the cam follower 66c moves within a respective cam groove 63, 64 to effect longitudinal advancement and retraction of the linear drivers 65a-d relative to the outer casing 31. The pitch of each of the cam grooves 63, 64 is configured to cycle (i.e., advance and retract) the linear drivers 65a-d to manipulate drive rods of a loading unit (e.g., a drive rods 48 (FIG. 17) of the stitching loading unit 40) to manipulate components within the jaw assembly 41 of the loading unit 40 (FIG. 1). A full rotation of the cam drum 62 may effect one longitudinal advancement and refraction of each of the linear drivers 65a-d or may effect multiple longitudinal advancements and retractions of each of the linear drivers 65a-d. A full cycle of each of the first and second pairs of linear drivers 65a, 65b and 65c, 65d includes four phases of movement. In a first phase of movement, both of the linear drivers of the pair of linear drivers (e.g., the linear drivers 65a, 65b) are advanced together in substantial alignment with one another. In a second phase of movement, a first driver of the pair of linear drivers (e.g., the linear driver 65a) is longitudinally fixed relative to the outer casing 31 and a second driver of the pair of linear drivers (e.g., the linear driver 65b) is longitudinally advanced relative to the outer casing 31. In a third phase of movement, the first driver of the pair of linear drivers (e.g., the linear driver 65a) remains longitudinally fixed within the outer casing 31 and the second linear driver of the pair of linear drivers (e.g., the linear driver 65b) is retracted within the outer casing 31 to move the second linear driver into substantial alignment with the first linear driver. In a fourth phase, both of the linear drivers of the pair of linear drivers (e.g., the linear driver 65a, 65b) are longitudinally fixed relative to the outer casing 31. It will be understood, that a full cycle of the second pair of linear drivers 65c, 65d is as detailed above with regard to the linear drivers 65a, 65b. In embodiments, when the first pair of linear drivers 65a, 65b is in the first phase of movement, the second pair of linear drivers 65c, 65d are in the fourth phase of movement. The first, second, and third phases of movement may be substantially equal in duration and the fourth phase of movement may account for a duration equal to the sum of the duration of the first three phases of movement. As one of the pairs of linear drivers cycles through the first three phases of movement, the other one of the pairs of linear drivers is in the fourth phase of movement. In some embodiments, as the first pair of linear drivers 65a, 65b begins the third phase of movement the second pair of linear drivers 65c, 65d begins the first phase of movement. In such embodiments, each of the four phases of movement may be substantially equal in duration. The pitch of each of the cam grooves 63, 64 may be configured to cycle the linear drivers 65a-d as the lead screw 55 effects constant advancement of the cam drum 62. It is also contemplated that the lead screw 55 may be intermittently rotated to intermittently advance the cam drum 62 (i.e., in a stepwise manner) and the pitch of the cam grooves 63, 64 may be configured cycle the linear drivers 65a-d as the lead screw 55 effects intermittent advancement of the cam drum 62. The cam drum input shaft 52 (FIG. 9) has a distal end supporting a drive gear 52a. As best shown in FIG. 10, the drive gear 52a engages the teeth 69a of a middle gear 69 such that the middle gear 69 rotates in response to rotation of the input shaft 52. The teeth 69a of the middle gear 69 engage the cam drum gear 61 such that the cam drum gear 61 rotates in response to rotation of the cam drum input shaft 52 as shown in FIG. 11. It will be appreciated that the cam drum 62 rotates in the same radial direction as the cam drum input shaft 52 and the middle gear 69 rotates in the opposite radial direction. The articulation input shaft 56 (FIG. 9) has a distal end supporting a drive gear 56a. The articulation shaft 76 (FIG. 9) has a proximal end supporting a proximal gear 76a. With reference to FIGS. 10 and 11, the drive gear 56a of the articulation input shaft 56 engages the proximal gear 76a of the articulation shaft 76 to effect rotation of the articulation shaft 76 in response to rotation of the articulation input shaft 56. As shown in FIG. 13, the articulation shaft 76 has a distal end supporting a distal gear 76b. The distal gear 76 engages teeth on the outer surface of the articulation drum 72 to rotate the articulation drum 72 in response to the rotation of the articulation input shaft 56. It will be appreciated that the articulation drum 72 rotates in the same radial direction as the articulation input shaft 56 and the articulation shaft 76 rotates in the opposite radial direction to that of the input shaft 56. It is further appreciated, that a portion of the articulation shaft 76 positioned between the proximal and distal gears 76a, 76b is dimensioned to prevent the articulation shaft 76 from interfering with the cam drum gear 61 as the cam drum 62 is translated within the outer casing 31 as shown in FIGS. 11 and 12. With reference to FIGS. 13-15, the articulation assembly 70 includes the articulation drum 72, the articulation cam 74, and an articulation drive bar 78. The articulation drive bar 78 includes an articulation hook 78a configured to engage an articulation rod 48 of the stitching loading unit 40 (FIG. 17) as detailed below. The articulation drum 72 and the articulation cam 74 are substantially cylindrical. The articulation cam 74 is disposed within the articulation drum 72 and includes a proximal flange 74a. The proximal flange 74a engages a surface of the articulation drum 72 to longitudinally fix the articulation cam 74 relative to the articulation drum 72. The articulation cam 74 includes a proximal camming surface 75 and an articulation key 75a. The articulation key 75a extends from the proximal camming surface 75 and is received within an articulation keyway 73a defined in an inner surface of the articulation drum 72. The cooperation of the articulation key 75a and the articulation keyway 73a rotationally fixes the articulation cam 74 to the articulation drum 72 such that rotation of the articulation cam 74 is effected by rotation of the articulation drum 72. The proximal camming surface 75 of the articulation cam 74 is a helical surface configured to slidably engage an articulation cam follower 79 of the articulation drive bar 78 such that rotational movement of the articulation cam 74 effects advancement of the articulation drive bar 78. The articulation drum 72 includes a helical distal camming surface 73 that is configured to slidably engage the articulation cam follower 79 such that rotational movement of the articulation drum 72 effects rotation of the articulation drive bar 78. The camming surfaces 73, 75 have a substantially similar profile such that the articulation cam follower 79 is retained between the camming surfaces 73, 75. As the as the articulation drum 72 rotates in a first direction (e.g., counter-clockwise when viewed from the proximal end), the cam follower 79 is advanced and as the articulation drum 72 is rotated in a second opposite direction (e.g., clockwise when viewed from the proximal end), the articulation cam follower 79 is retracted. The articulation assembly 70 includes a plurality of articulated positions between a first articulated position and a second articulated position. The articulation assembly 70 also includes a straight position substantially halfway between the first and second articulated positions. Referring to FIGS. 16-28, the adaptor 30 is secured to a connector of a loading unit (e.g., the connector 44 of the stitching loading unit 40) by a locking mechanism 80 of the adapter 30. With particular reference to FIGS. 17 and 18, a proximal portion of the stitching loading unit 40 includes a connector 44. The connector 44 includes guide lugs 47, drive rods 48, and an articulation rod 49. Referring also to FIG. 19, the locking mechanism 80 is disposed substantially within the distal cover 36 of the adaptor 30 and includes a release switch 81 (FIG. 18) disposed on an outer surface of the outer casing 31. A distal end portion 38 of the outer casing 31 defines a locking opening 82 and locking grooves 83. The release switch 81 includes a lock arm 85 extending distally therefrom. A switch-biasing member 81 a is operatively associated with the release switch 81 to urge the release switch 81 distally. A lock bar 84 is operatively associated with the release switch 81 such that longitudinal advancement or retraction of the release switch 81 effects longitudinal advancement or retraction of the lock bar 84 and longitudinal advancement or retraction of the lock bar 84 effects longitudinal advancement or retraction of the release switch 81 as detailed below. The lock bar 84 is disposed in one of the locking grooves 83. The articulation drum 72 defines an articulation interlock groove 86 that is aligned with the lock arm 85 when the articulation assembly 70 is in the straight configuration as shown in FIG. 20. A portion of the lock arm 85 may be in contact with the outer surface of the articulation cam 74 as shown in FIG. 21. With particular reference to FIGS. 22-24, the distal end portion 38 of the outer casing 31 defines a lug lock 87 in communication with the locking groove 83. The lock arm 85 is disposed within the locking groove 83. The locking mechanism 80 has a locked configuration (FIG. 22) and an open configuration (FIG. 23). In the locked configuration, the lock bar 84 extends within the locking groove 83 past the lug lock 87. The switch biasing member 81 a (FIG. 19) biases the locking mechanism 80 towards the locked configuration. The release switch 81 may be engaged by a clinician to move the release switch 81 proximally against the switch-biasing member 81 a as shown in FIG. 23 or one of the guide lugs 47 may engage the lock bar 84 to move the lock bar 84 proximally to the unlocked configuration. It will be appreciated that the lock arm 85 must be aligned with the articulation lock groove 86 (FIG. 20) for the locking mechanism 80 to transition to the unlocked configuration (i.e., the articulation assembly must be in the straight configuration). For example, if the articulation assembly 70 is in the first or second articulated configurations, the articulation drum 72 will be positioned such that the articulation lock groove 86 will not be aligned with the lock arm 85 to prevent the locking mechanism 80 from transitioning to the unlocked configuration. Moreover, when the locking mechanism 80 is in the unlocked configuration, the lock arm 85 will prevent the articulation drum 72 from rotating and will prevent the articulation assembly 70 from transitioning to the straight configuration. When the connector 44 of the stitching loading unit 40 engages the adaptor 30, the guide lugs 47 are aligned with the locking grooves 83. As shown in FIG. 24, when the guide lugs 47 slide proximally within the locking grooves 83, one of the guide lugs 47 may engage the lock bar 84 to urge the locking mechanism 80 to the unlocked configuration. When the guide lugs 47 abut the lock bar 84 in the unlocked configuration, the stitching loading unit 40 is rotated relative to the adaptor 30 to rotate the guiding lug 47 into the lug lock 87 as shown in FIG. 25. The locking mechanism 80 then returns to the locked configuration such that the lock bar 84 extends within the locking groove 83 to capture the guiding lug 47 within the lug lock 87 as shown in FIG. 26. With reference to FIGS. 27 and 28, when the stitching loading unit 40 is inserted into the adaptor 30, the drive rods 48 and the articulation rod 49 are captured by the engagement hooks 68 of the linear drive arms 67 and the articulation hook 78a of the articulation drive arm 78 respectively. When the guide lugs 47 are aligned in the locking grooves 83, the drive rods 48 are offset from the engagement hooks 68 and the articulation rod 49 is offset from the articulation hook 78a as shown in FIG. 27. When the stitching loading unit 40 is rotated to secure the guiding lug 47 within the lug lock 87 as shown in FIG. 25, the drive rods 48 are captured in the engagement hooks 68 and the articulation rod 49 is captured in the articulation hook 78a as shown in FIG. 28. When the rods 48, 49 are captured within the hooks 68, 78a, longitudinal translation of the hooks 68, 78a effects longitudinal translation of the rods 48, 49 as detailed above to manipulate components of the stitching loading unit 40. The stitching loading unit 40 can be released from the adaptor 30 by retracting the release switch 81 against the switch-biasing member 81 a as shown in FIG. 23. With the release switch 81 retracted, the stitching loading unit 40 is rotated to move the guide lug 47 out of the lug lock 87. With the guide lug 47 out of the lug lock 87, the stitching loading unit 40 is free to be removed from the adaptor 30. The switch 81 may be released when the guide lug 47 is within the locking groove 83 such that the lock bar 84 is advanced by the switch-biasing member 81 a to disengage the stitching loading unit 40 from the adaptor 30. Another loading unit may then be secured to the adaptor 30.
