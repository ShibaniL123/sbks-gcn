(122-2) Synthesis of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-{2-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-2H-tetrazol-5-yl}pyrrolidin-2-one (Compound 122)
A suspension of 1-(4-Chlorophenyl)-4-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)pyrrolidin-2-one (190 mg), [4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl] boronic acid (237 mg), potassium carbonate (110 mg), lithium chloride (15 mg) and di-µ-hydroxo-bis[(N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) copper (II)] chloride (41 mg) in dichloromethane (3 mL) was stirred at room temperature under an oxygen atmosphere for 24 hours. After stirring for 24 hours, the reaction was stopped by adding a 10% aqueous ammonia solution (15 mL). The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (30 mL × 2), and the combined organic layer was washed with saturated brine (30 mL) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to obtain the title compound 13 mg (yield 3.4%).
