EXAMPLE 16
5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (reaction scheme No. 3, compound 16)
16.1: (1-benzyl-piperidin-4-yl)-[2-(2-nitrophenyl)-ethyl]-amine
8 ml (40 mmol) of 1-benzyl-piperidin-4-ylamine is added to 4 g (17.4 mmol) of 1-(2-bromoethyl)-2-nitrobenzene and the mixture is heated at 100Â° C. for 18 hours. After cooling, diethyl ether is added, the mixture is filtered and the filtrate is concentrated. The crude residue is purified by silica gel chromatography eluted with an ethyl acetate/heptane mixture, 60/40 and then dichloromethane/methanol/ammonia, 95/3/2. 4.9 g (82%) of (1-benzyl-piperidin-4-yl)-[2-(2-nitrophenyl)-ethyl]-amine is obtained in the form of an orange-coloured oil.
