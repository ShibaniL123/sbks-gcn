DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIGS. 1 through 5 thereof, a new exercise device embodying the principles and concepts of an embodiment of the disclosure and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described. As best illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 5, the compressive exercise device 10 generally comprises a tube 12 being elongated and having a bottom section 14 and a top section 16. The top section 16 is slidably inserted into the bottom section 14 wherein the tube 12 is telescopic. The top section 16 of the tube 12 may comprise a first portion 18 coupled to a second portion 20. A connector 22 couples the first portion 18 to the second portion 20 such that the first portion 18 is linearly aligned with the second portion 20. A longitudinal slot 24 extends through the bottom section 14 of the tube 12. The slot 24 has a top end 26 and a bottom end 28. A loop 30 is resilient and has a first end 32 coupled to the bottom section 14 of the tube 12 proximate a bottom end 34 of the bottom section 14 of the tube 12. Each of a pair of rollers 36 is coupled to an associated side 38 of the bottom section 14 of the tube 12 between the top end 26 of the slot 24 and a top end 40 of the bottom section 14 of the tube 12. The loop 30 extends over each of the rollers 36. A pin 42 is coupled to the top section 16 of the tube 12. The pin 42 extends through the slot 24 and is slidable in the slot 24 as the top section 16 of the tube 12 slides relative to the bottom section 14 of the tube 12. The loop 30 is coupled to the pin 42 such that the loop 30 is stretched as the pin 42 is moved in the slot 24 away from the top end 26 of the slot 24 towards the bottom end 28 of the slot 24 wherein the loop 30 provides resistance to compression of the tube 12. A channel 44 is coupled to the pin 42. The loop 30 is seated in the channel 44. A wheel 46 is rotatably coupled to the pin 42. The channel 44 extends around a complete diameter of the wheel 46 wherein tension in the loop 30 as the tube 12 is compressed is distributed evenly over each roller 36. A swivel bracket 48 may be coupled to the bottom section 14 of the tube 12. The first end 32 of the loop 30 is coupled to the swivel bracket 48. An elongated extension 50 may define the second portion 20 of the top section 16. The extension 50 has a first end 52 selectively couplable to an upper end 54 of the first portion 18 of the top section 16 of the tube 12. A handle 56 is selectively couplable to the extension 50 wherein the handle 56 is in a static position relative to the upper section 16 of the tube 12. Thus, the handle 56 is configured to be grasped to facilitate urging the upper section 16 of the tube 12 to slide into the bottom section 14 of the tube 12. The handle 56 may have a pair of outer sections 58. The outer sections 58 extend outwardly from the extension 50 when the handle 56 is coupled to the extension 50. The outer sections 58 may extend transversely relative to the extension 50. Each outer section 58 may further comprise a first section 60 and a second section 62 with the first section 60 forming a right angle with the second section 62. A sleeve 64 may be coupled to the handle 56. The extension 50 is inserted through the sleeve 64. The handle 56 may comprise an offset section 66 coupled to and extending between the sleeve 64 and the outer sections 58 of the handle 56 wherein the outer sections 58 are laterally offset from the extension 50. A locking member 68 selectively engages the sleeve 64 and the extension 50 wherein the locking member 68 secures the sleeve 64 in a static position on the extension 50. A plurality of holes 70 extends through the extension 50. The locking member 68 is engageable to a selectable one of the holes 70 wherein the handle 56 is selectively positionable along a length of the extension 50. A plurality of apertures 72 extends through the first portion 18 of the top section 16 of the tube 12. Each aperture 72 is aligned with the slot 24. The pin 42 is couplable to a selectable one of the apertures 72 wherein resistance to compression from the loop 30 is adjustable by selective positioning of the pin 42 along a length of the top section 16 of the tube 12 within the slot 24. In use, the device 10 is configured to provide a desired amount of resistance as the tube 12 is compressed. The handle 56 may be used or the top section 16 of the tube 12 may be grasped directly and force exerted to compress the top section 16 into the bottom section 14. The loop 30 provides resistance over the full range of motion during compression. The user may also release compressive force on the tube 12 gradually to prevent the loop 30 from aggressively expanding the tube 12. With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure.
