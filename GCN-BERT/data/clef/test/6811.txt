TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a photosensitive resin composition, and a photosensitive film using the same. BACKGROUND ART As image forming methods utilized for patterning and the like of electronic components such as semiconductor integrated circuits, liquid crystal display devices and printed wiring boards, there are known methods of utilizing positive-type photoresists using as a raw material a positive-type photosensitive resin composition containing a novolac-type phenol resin and 1,2-quinonediazide compound (for example, Patent Literatures 1 to 6). In the case where a photosensitive layer is formed by applying a positive-type photosensitive resin composition on a substrate or the like, it is usual that the film thickness of the layer is 0.5 to several microns. When such a positive-type photosensitive resin composition is used, the formation of an image pattern over wide dimensional ranges is enabled. The dimensional range has wide ranges of, for example, from a sub-half-micron region of about 0.3 μm to a considerably large dimensional width of about several hundred microns. Thereby, the microfabrication of a wide variety of substrate surfaces is enabled.

Thus, a pattern can be formed by again irradiating the remaining film with light. Then, for a substrate having two or more metal layers, there has been studied the formation of patterns of the metal layers on the substrate by repeating a step of etching the metal layers after exposure and development of a photosensitive layer using a positive-type photosensitive resin composition. However, it is difficult for a conventional positive-type photosensitive resin composition to form a photosensitive layer simultaneously satisfying the developing solution resistance of unexposed portions and the developability of exposed portions in the repeated development. Particularly in image formation applications to be utilized for patterning and the like of touch panel sensors, metal layers to be used are diversified accompanying the wiring micronization, the size reduction, the cost reduction, the avoidance of risks due to being free from rare metals, and the energy saving. Then, it is an object of the present invention to provide: a positive-type photosensitive resin composition to form a photosensitive layer which is excellent in its adhesion force to various types of metals, sufficiently excellent in the developability of exposed portions and the developing solution resistance of unexposed portions, and capable of being repeatedly developed with a weak alkali developing solution; and a photosensitive film using the positive-type photosensitive resin composition.

Advantageous Effects of Invention According to the present invention, there can be provided: a positive-type photosensitive resin composition to form a photosensitive layer which is excellent in its adhesion force to various types of metals, sufficiently excellent in the developability of exposed portions and the developing solution resistance of unexposed portions, and capable of being repeatedly developed with a weak alkali developing solution; and a photosensitive film using the positive-type photosensitive resin composition.

Examples of the aldehyde include formaldehyde, acetoaldehyde, acetone, glyceraldehyde and methyl glyoxylate. A precursor of formaldehyde such as paraformaldehyde or trioxane may be used for a reaction with the phenol derivative. These are used singly or in a combination of two or more. From the viewpoint of the adhesivity of a resist pattern and the flexibility of a photosensitive layer, it is preferable for the unsaturated hydrocarbon group of the unsaturated hydrocarbon group-containing compound to contain two or more unsaturated groups. Further, from the viewpoint of the compatibility when a resin composition is formulated and the flexibility when a photosensitive layer is formed, the number of carbon atoms of the unsaturated hydrocarbon group is preferably 4 to 100, more preferably 8 to 80, and still more preferably 10 to 60.

The reaction time is usually 1 to 50 hours, though depending on the kind or the amount of a catalyst to be used. After the finish of the reaction, a modified novolac-type phenol resin having unsaturated hydrocarbon groups is obtained by dehydrating a reaction product at a temperature of 200° C. or lower under reduced pressure. Here, in the reaction, a solvent such as toluene, xylene or methanol can be used. A modified novolac-type phenol resin having unsaturated hydrocarbon groups can also be obtained by polycondensing the above-mentioned unsaturated hydrocarbon group-modified phenol derivative with an aldehyde together with a compound other than phenol, such as m-xylene. In this case, the molar ratio of the compound other than phenol to a compound obtained by reacting a phenol derivative with an unsaturated hydrocarbon group-containing compound is preferably lower than 0.5.

There can also be used, as an (A) component, a phenol resin acid-modified by reacting phenolic hydroxyl groups remaining in the above-mentioned modified novolac-type phenol resin having unsaturated hydrocarbon groups further with a polybasic acid anhydride. The acid modification with a polybasic acid anhydride introduces carboxyl groups and the acid-modified phenol resin is enabled to be easily developed even with a weak alkali aqueous solution (developing solution).

Since these 1,2-quinonediazide compounds having a sulfo group and/or a sulfonyl chloride group are good in the compatibility with compounds represented by the above formulae (1) to (3), they can reduce the amount of aggregates produced when at least one selected from the group consisting of an (A) component, a (B) component and a (C) component is mixed with a (D) component. When a photosensitive resin composition containing these is used as a photosensitive component of a positive-type photoresist, the positive-type photoresist becomes better in the sensitivity, the image contrast and the heat resistance. It is more preferable for a compound represented by one of the above formulae (1) to (3) to be a compound represented by one of the following formulae (4) to (6), respectively. This case has an advantage of being better in the photosensitivity. Examples of the method for synthesizing a 1,2-quinonediazide compound using a compound represented by one of the above formulae (4) to (6) includes the following method. Specifically, a compound represented by one of the above formulae (4) to (6) and a 1,2-naphthoquinone-2-diazide-sulfonyl chloride are added in a solvent such as dioxane or THF (tetrahydrofuran), and the resulting solution is allowed to react in the presence of an alkali catalyst such as triethylamine, triethanolamine, an alkali carbonate or an alkali hydrogencarbonate. At this time, there is synthesized a 1,2-quinonediazide compound in which a hydroxyl group of the compound represented by one of the above formulae (4) to (6) and a sulfonyl group of 1,2-naphthoquinone-2-diazide-sulfonyl chloride are condensed. Here, it suffices if at least one bond between a hydroxyl group of the compound represented by one of the above formulae (4) to (6) and a sulfonyl group of the 1,2-naphthoquinone-2-diazide-sulfonyl chloride is present in the molecule of the 1,2-quinonediazide compound to be obtained. As 1,2-naphthoquinone-2-diazide-sulfonyl chloride, 1,2-naphthoquinone-2-diazide-4-sulfonyl chloride or 1,2-naphthoquinone-2-diazide-5-sulfonyl chloride is suitable. These may be used singly or in a combination of two or more. From the viewpoint of the photosensitive property and the mechanical property, the content of the (D) component in a photosensitive resin composition is preferably 3 to 30 parts by mass, more preferably 5 to 25 parts by mass, and especially preferably 10 to 20 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass of the total amount of the (A) component, the (B) component, the (C) component and the (D) component. <(E) Component> The (E) component is a polybasic acid or a polybasic acid anhydride. In the positive-type photosensitive resin composition according to the present embodiment, the content of the (E) component is lower than 40 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the total amount of the (A) component, the (B) component, the (C) component and the (D) component. By adding a polybasic acid or a polybasic acid anhydride, carboxyl groups are introduced and the complex formation reaction with the surface of a metal substrate is easily caused to thereby improve the adhesivity, and further the positive-type photosensitive resin composition is enabled to be easily developed even with a weak alkali aqueous solution (developing solution). From the viewpoint of the solubility to a solvent to be used when a photosensitive resin composition is prepared, it is preferable to use a polybasic acid anhydride as the (E) component. The polybasic acid anhydride is not especially limited as long as having an acid anhydride group formed by dehydrating condensation of carboxyl groups of a polybasic acid having a plurality of carboxyl groups. Examples of the polybasic acid anhydride include dibasic acid anhydrides such as phthalic anhydride, succinic anhydride, octenylsuccinic anhydride, pentadodecenylsuccinic anhydride, maleic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic anhydride, methyltetrahydrophthalic anhydride, methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride, nadic anhydride, 3,6-endomethylenetetrahydrophthalic anhydride, methylendomethylenetetrahydrophthalic anhydride, tetrabromophthalic anhydride and pyromellitic anhydride, and aromatic tetrabasic acid dianhydrides such as biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride, naphthalenetetracarboxylic dianhydride, diphenyl ether tetracarboxylic dianhydride, butanetetracarboxylic dianhydride, cyclopentanetetracarboxylic dianhydride, pyromellitic anhydride and benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride. These may be used singly or in a combination of two or more. Among these, it is preferable for the polybasic acid anhydride to be a dibasic acid anhydride; and it is more preferable for the polybasic acid anhydride to be one or more selected from the group consisting of tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, succinic anhydride and phthalic anhydride. This case has an advantage of being capable of forming a resist pattern having a better shape. The polybasic acid is not especially limited as long as having a polybasic acid having a plurality of carboxyl groups obtained by hydrolyzing the above polybasic acid anhydride. Further as the (E) component, there may be used a substance containing both of a polybasic acid and a polybasic acid anhydride in one molecule thereof, such as trimellitic anhydride or pyromellitic monoanhydride. From the viewpoint of the photosensitive property and the mechanical property, the upper limit value of the content of the (E) component in a photosensitive resin composition is lower than 40 parts by mass, preferably 35 parts by mass or lower, and more preferably 30 parts by mass or lower, per 100 parts by mass of the total amount of the (A) component, the (B) component, the (C) component and the (D) component. On the other hand, the lower limit value of the content of the (E) component is higher than 0 part by mass, preferably 0.1 parts by mass or higher, more preferably 1 part by mass or higher, still more preferably 3 parts by mass or higher, and especially preferably 5 parts by mass or higher. <(F) Component> For the purpose of improving the coatability, the defoaming property, the leveling property and the like of a positive-type photosensitive resin composition, and improving the separability of a photosensitive layer from a support film when the composition is made into a photosensitive film, the photosensitive resin composition according to the present embodiment may contain a fluorine-based surfactant as an (F) component. As the fluorine-based surfactant, there can be used commercially available products, for example, BM-1000, BM-1100 (hitherto, manufactured by BM Chemie GmbH, trade name); Megafac F142D, Megafac F172, Megafac F173, Megafac F183, Megafac R-08, Megafac R-30, Megafac R-90PM-20, Megafac BL-20 (hitherto, manufactured by DIC Corp., trade name, “Megafac” is its registered trademark); Fluorad FC-135, Fluorad FC-170C, Fluorad FC-430, Fluorad FC-431, Novec FC-4330, Novec FC-4432 (hitherto, manufactured by Sumitomo 3M Ltd., trade name); and Surflon S-112, Surflon S-113, Surflon S-131, Surflon S-141, Surflon S-145 (hitherto, manufactured by Asahi Glass Co., Ltd., trade name, “Surflon” is its registered trademark). Among these, from the viewpoint of more improving the crack generating property after exposure, Novec FC-4430 and Novec FC-4432, which are fluorine-based surfactants having a perfluorobutanesulfonic acid skeleton, are especially preferable. These are used singly or in a combination of two or more. In the case where the (F) component is blended in a photosensitive resin composition, the content thereof is preferably 0.1 to 5 parts by mass, more preferably 0.2 to 2 parts by mass, and still more preferably 0.3 to 1 part by mass, per 100 parts by mass of the total amount of the (A) component, the (B) component, the (C) component and the (D) component. When the content of the (F) component exceeds 5 parts by mass, the image contrast is likely to decrease. <(G) Component> From the viewpoint of improving the coatability to a support film, and the adhesivity of a formed photosensitive layer to a base material and the developability thereof after exposure, the photosensitive resin composition according to the present embodiment may contain an adhesivity-imparting agent as a (G) component. As the (G) component, there can be used an adhesive auxiliary agent such as a nitrogen-containing compound, a silane coupling agent and an aluminum chelating agent, and a solubility regulating agent such as a high-boiling point solvent. It is preferable for the nitrogen-containing compound to have an azole group, an amino group, an amido group, an imino group, an imido group or the like, and examples thereof include imidazole, pyrazole, benzimidazole, triazole-based compounds such as benzotriazol and mercaptotriazole, alkylamines, piperidine, piperazine, morpholine, aniline, ethylenediamine, catecholamine, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, bipyridine, terpyridine, and phenanthroline. It is preferable for the silane coupling agent to have a reactive substituent such as a carboxyl group, a methacryloyl group, an isocyanate group or an epoxy group, and examples thereof include trimethoxysilyl benzoate, γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, vinyltriacetoxysilane, vinyltrimethoxysilane, γ-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, and β-(3,4-epoxycyclohexyl)ethyltrimethoxysilane. Examples of the aluminum chelating agent include aluminum ethyl acetoacetate.diisopropylate, aluminum tris(ethyl acetoacetate), aluminum bis(ethyl acetoacetate).monoacetylacetonate and aluminum trisacetylacetonate. Among these adhesive auxiliary agents, from the viewpoint of the developability, nitrogen-containing compounds are especially preferable; triazole-based compounds are more preferable; and mercaptotriazole is still more preferable. In the case where an adhesive auxiliary agent is blended in a photosensitive resin composition, the content thereof is preferably 0.1 to 5 parts by mass, more preferably 0.15 to 3 parts by mass, and still more preferably 0.2 to 2 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass of the total amount of the (A) component, the (B) component, the (C) component and the (D) component. The high-boiling point solvent is a solvent having a boiling point under normal pressure of 150° C. or higher, and examples thereof include N-methylformamide, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide, dihexyl ether, caproic acid, caprylic acid, 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, benzyl alcohol, benzyl acetate, ethyl benzoate, γ-butyrolactone, and phenyl cellosolve acetate. The blending amount of the solubility regulating agent can suitably be adjusted depending on the application and the coating method, and is not especially limited as long as the blending amount is capable of homogeneous mixing of the photosensitive resin composition, but it is preferably 60% by mass or smaller with respect to the total amount of the photosensitive resin composition, and more preferably 40% by mass or smaller. <Other Components> In the photosensitive resin composition according to the present embodiment, a solvent later described may be contained in order to regulate the viscosity, and additives such as sensitizers, light absorbers (dyes), crosslinking agents, plasticizers, pigments, fillers, flame retardants, stabilizers, stripping accelerators, antioxidants, perfumes, imaging agents and thermal crosslinking agents may be contained, as required. These can be used singly or in a combination of two or more. The blending amount of these additives is not especially limited as long as the properties of the photosensitive resin composition are not impaired, but the blending amount is preferably 50% by mass or smaller with respect to the total amount of the photosensitive resin composition. The preparation of the photosensitive resin composition may be made by mixing and stirring by usual methods, and in the case of adding fillers, pigments and the like, may be made by dispersing and mixing by using a dispersing machine such as a dissolver, a homogenizer or a three-roll mill. Further as required, the filtration may be carried out using a mesh, a membrane filter or the like. [Photosensitive Film] A photosensitive film according to the present embodiment has a support film at least one surface of which has been subjected to a release treatment, and a photosensitive layer provided on the surface of the support film which has been subjected to a release treatment and formed from the positive-type photosensitive resin composition. On the surface of the photosensitive layer opposite to the support film, as required, a protecting film can be laminated. FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating one embodiment of the photosensitive film. The photosensitive film 10 illustrated in FIG. 1 has a structure in which a photosensitive layer 4 is laminated on a support film 2, and a protecting film 6 is further laminated on the surface of the photosensitive layer 4 opposite to the support film 2. The photosensitive layer 4 is a layer formed using the photosensitive resin composition according to the present embodiment. <Support Film> The support film 2 according to the present embodiment has at least one surface which has been subjected to a release treatment. Here, the release treatment refers to a chemical treatment in which the surface of a support film is thinly coated with a release agent including a silicone-based surfactant, a silicone-based compound such as a silicone resin, a fluorine-based surfactant, a fluorine-containing compound such as a fluororesin, or an alkyd resin; or a physical treatment in which a support film is corona-treated or the like. In the case of applying a release agent on a support film, it is preferable to thinly apply the release agent within the limits of providing a release effect. After the application of the release agent, the release agent may be fixed on the support film by heat or a UV treatment. It is more preferable to provide an undercoat layer on the support film before the release agent is applied. From the viewpoint of the coatability of a photosensitive resin composition and the separability of a photosensitive layer, the surface tension (wetting tension) at 23° C. of the release treatment-subjected surface of a support film is preferably 20 to 45 mN/m, more preferably 30 to 45 mN/m, and still more preferably 35 to 45 mN/m. Further from the viewpoint of the separability of a photosensitive layer, the 180° peel strength at 23° C. of the release treatment-subjected surface of a support film is preferably 5 to 300 gf/inch (1.97 to 118 gf/cm or 19.3 to 1156.4×10−3 N/cm), more preferably 5 to 200 gf/inch (1.97 to 78.7 gf/cm or 19.3 to 771.3×10−3 N/cm), and still more preferably 100 to 200 gf/inch (39.4 to 78.7 gf/cm or 386.1 to 771.3×10−3 N/cm). The 180° peel strength can be measured by a usual method (for example, a method according to JIS K6854-2) using an adhesive tape (manufactured by Nitto Denko Corp., trade name: “NITTO31B”). The support film before being subjected to a release treatment is not especially limited as long as a surface thereof is smooth, and there can be used a polymer film formed of, for example, a polyester such as a polyethylene terephthalate, or a polyolefin such as a polypropylene or a polyethylene; and among these, a polyethylene terephthalate film (hereinafter, referred to as “PET film”) is preferable. As a PET film at least one surface of which has been subjected to a release treatment with a silicone compound, for example, “Purex A53”, “A31-25”, “A51-25” and “A53-38” by trade name, manufactured by Teijin DuPont Films Japan Ltd., are available as commercial products (“Purex” is its registered trademark). The thickness of the support film 2 is preferably 15 to 50 μm, and more preferably 25 to 40 μm. With the thickness of the support film 2 of smaller than 15 μm, there arises a possibility that strains in the release treatment remain and winding wrinkles are generated when the film is taken up; and with that exceeding 50 μm, bubbles are likely to be easily entrained between a base material and the photosensitive layer 4 in thermal pressure bonding when the photosensitive layer 4 is laminated on the base material. <Protecting Film> As the protecting film 6, there can be used a polymer film formed of, for example, a polyester such as PET, or a polyolefin such as a polypropylene or a polyethylene. As in the support film, the polymer film having been subjected to a release treatment may be used. From the viewpoint of the flexibility of the photosensitive film when being taken up in a roll-form, a polyethylene film is especially preferable as the protecting film 6. Further, it is preferable for the protecting film 6 to be a low-fish eye film so as to be able to reduce recesses of the photosensitive layer surface. The thickness of the protecting film 6 is preferably 10 to 100 μm, and especially preferably 15 to 80 μm. Then, a method for fabricating the photosensitive film 10 according to the present embodiment will be described. The photosensitive layer 4 can be formed by applying the photosensitive resin composition as a liquid resist on the support film 2. When the photosensitive resin composition is applied on the support film 2, there may be used, as a coating solution, a solution prepared by dissolving the photosensitive resin composition in a predetermined solvent and having a solid content of 20 to 90% by mass, as required. Examples of such solvents include organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, octane, decane, petroleum ether, petroleum naphtha, hydrogenated petroleum naphtha, solvent naphtha, acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, diethyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, methyl amyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, toluene, xylene, tetramethylbenzene, N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylphosphorylamide, tetramethylene sulfone, γ-butyrolactone, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monoethyl ether, propylene glycol monopropyl ether, propylene glycol monobutyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, triethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl lactate, benzyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, ethoxyethyl propionate, 3-methylmethoxy propionate, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate, dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether, dipropylene glycol diethyl ether and dipropylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate; and mixed solvents thereof. Examples of the coating method include methods of roll coat, comma coat, gravure coat, air knife coat, die coat, bar coat, spin coat and the like. The removal of the solvent can be carried out, for example, by heating. In this case, the heating temperature is preferably about 70 to 150° C.; and the heating time is preferably about 5 to about 30 min. The amount of the remaining organic solvent in the photosensitive layer 4 thus formed is preferably 2% by mass or smaller, from the viewpoint of preventing the diffusion of the organic solvent in subsequent steps. With respect to the thickness of the photosensitive layer 4, though depending on the applications, the thickness after the removal of the solvent is preferably about 1 to 30 μm. In the case where a photosensitive film is used in a roll-form, the thickness of the photosensitive layer 4 is preferably made to be 1 to 5 μm, from the viewpoint of being able to reduce cracks in the photosensitive layer 4. Here in the case of fabricating a thick photosensitive film the thickness of which photosensitive layer 4 is made to be 5 pan to 30 μm, by using a modified phenol resin having unsaturated hydrocarbon groups as the (A) component, cracks of the photosensitive layer 4 can be suppressed. The photosensitive film 10 may further have middle layers or protecting layers such as a cushioning layer, an adhesion layer, a light absorbing layer and a gas barrier layer, between the support film 2 and the photosensitive layer 4, and/or between the photosensitive layer 4 and the protecting film 6. The photosensitive film 10, for example, can be taken up on a cylindrical or another shape winding core, and stored in a roll-form. The winding core is not especially limited as long as being one conventionally used, and examples thereof include plastics such as polyethylene resins, polypropylene resins, polystyrene resins, polyvinyl chloride resins and ABS resins (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymers). In the storage time, it is preferable for the photosensitive film 10 to be taken up so that the support film is present outermost. Further, it is preferable to install edge surface separators on the edge surfaces of the photosensitive film (photosensitive film roll) taken up in a roll-form, from the viewpoint of the edge surface protection; and it is preferable to install moistureproofing edge surface separators additionally from the viewpoint of the edge fusion resistance. Further, it is preferable to wrap the photosensitive film 10, when packaging, in a black sheet having a low moisture permeability. [Method for Forming a Resist Pattern] Then, a method for forming a resist pattern will be described. A method for forming a resist pattern comprises a step of forming a photosensitive layer on a base material by using the positive-type photosensitive resin composition, a step of exposing the photosensitive layer formed on the base material, and a step of developing the photosensitive layer with an alkali developing solution after the exposure to thereby form a resist pattern. The photosensitive layer to be formed from the positive-type photosensitive resin composition according to the present embodiment can repeatedly be subjected to an exposure step and a development step. As the base material to form a resist pattern, there can be used, for example, a base material which has two or more layers of metal layers on a substrate constituted of a material undissolvable to an etching solution for metal use. As the substrate, there can be used a substrate constituted of, for example, a glass, a metal oxide such as titanium oxide or alumina, a semiconductor such as silicon, or an organic compound such as polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyester or polycarbonate. Examples of the metal layer include layers constituted of a metal such as gold, silver, copper, aluminum, iron, tungsten, molybdenum, titanium and nickel, or a metal oxide such as indium tin oxide (ITO) and zinc oxide. The metal layer can be formed by stacking the metal or metal oxide on the substrate by vacuum deposition, sputtering, electroplating, electroless plating, or chemical vapor deposition using a plasma. Examples of a method for forming a photosensitive layer include a method in which the positive-type photosensitive resin composition is applied on a base material, and dried to vaporize a solvent and the like to thereby form a coating film (photosensitive layer), and a method in which the photosensitive layer in the above-mentioned photosensitive film is transferred to a base material. As a method for applying a photosensitive resin composition on a base material, there can be used the same method as the above-mentioned application method on the support film. A method for forming a photosensitive layer on a base material by using the photosensitive film 10 will be described. The method for forming a resist pattern involves laminating the photosensitive film 10 on the base material so that the photosensitive layer 4 closely adheres on the base material, and thereafter irradiating the laminate with an active light beam in an image pattern and removing exposed portions by development. Portions not irradiated with the active light beam, since the (D) component as a photosensitive agent causes interactions with phenol resins as the (A), (B) and (C) components and functions as a dissolution inhibitor, hardly dissolves in an alkali. In the portions irradiated with the active light beam, however, the (D) component is photodecomposed and the dissolution inhibition effect is lost. Thereby, the exposed portions irradiated with the active light beam become alkali-soluble. A lamination method of the photosensitive layer 4 on the base material includes a method in which after the protecting film 6 is removed, the photosensitive layer 4 is pressure-bonded to the base material under being heated at about 70 to 130° C. by using a laminator or the like under a pressure of about 0.1 to 1 MPa (about 1 to 10 kgf/cm2). Such a lamination step may be carried out under reduced pressure. The photosensitive layer 4 thus laminated on the base material is irradiated with an active light beam in an image pattern through a negative or positive mask pattern to thereby form exposed portions. At this time, in the case where the support film 2 present on the photosensitive layer 4 is transparent to the active light beam, the active light beam can be irradiated through the support film 2; and in the case where the support film 2 exhibits the light blocking effect on the active light beam, the photosensitive layer 4 is irradiated with the active light beam after the support film 2 is removed. As a light source of the active light beam, there is used a conventionally well-known light source, for example, a lamp effectively radiating ultraviolet light, visible light or the like, such as a carbon arc lamp, a mercury vapor arc lamp, a high-pressure mercury lamp, or a xenon lamp. Also a laser direct writing exposure method or the like may be used. After the formation of the exposed portions, a resist pattern is formed by removing the photosensitive layer of the exposed portions by development. Removal methods of such exposed portions include a method in which the support film 2 is removed by an autopeeler or the like in the case where the support film 2 is present on the photosensitive layer 4, and the exposed portions are removed by a wet development using a developing solution such as an alkali aqueous solution, an aqueous developing solution or an organic solvent, by a dry development or the like. Examples of alkalis to be used in the wet development include weak alkali inorganic compounds such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and ammonia; alkali metal compounds such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide; alkaline earth metal compounds such as calcium hydroxide; weak alkali organic compounds such as monomethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, monoethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, monopropylamine, dimethylpropylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, ethylenediamine, diethylenetriamine, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate and polyethyleneimine; and tetramethylammonium hydroxide, and tetraethylammonium hydroxide. These may be used singly or in a combination of two or more as an aqueous solution. The pH of the alkali aqueous solution is preferably in the range of 9 to 13; and from the viewpoint of the environmental load reduction, the pH is preferably in the range of 9 to 12. The temperature is regulated so as to suit the developability of the photosensitive layer. The alkali aqueous solution may further be mixed with a surfactant, a defoaming agent, an organic solvent and the like. Examples of the development method include a dip method, a spray method, a brushing method, and a slapping method. Here, as a treatment after the development, the resist pattern may be cured by heating at about 60 to 250° C. before use, as required. The resist pattern is thus obtained. The use of the photosensitive film 10 according to the present invention, since being excellent in the transferability of the photosensitive layer 4 to the base material, makes easy the separation or removal of the support film 2, enables the photosensitive layer 4 to be transferred with no defects to the base material, and resultantly enables the resist pattern having sufficiently few defects to be formed. Further since the exposed portions of the photosensitive layer 4 easily dissolve in the weak alkali aqueous solution and strip from the base material, and are remarkably good in the weak alkali developability, a fine resist pattern excellent in contrast is enabled to be formed. In the present embodiment, a photosensitive layer can be formed by directly applying and drying a positive-type photosensitive resin composition on the base material. In this case, the positive-type photosensitive resin composition is rotationally applied on the base material by using a spinner or the like to thereby form a coating film. The base material having the coating film formed thereon is dried by using a hot plate, an oven or the like. Thereby, the photosensitive layer is formed on the base material. An exposure step and a development step thereafter can be carried out similarly to the case of using the photosensitive film 10. In the present embodiment, as required, the exposure and the development are allowed to be repeated twice or more times in the state that the photosensitive layer is formed on the base material. That is, when two or more layers of metal layers are etched by repeating exposure and development steps, the use of the positive-type photosensitive resin composition according to the present embodiment enables to eliminate steps of stripping a resist pattern once formed from the base material and again newly forming a photosensitive layer on the base material. Thereby, since the steps when metal layers of a base material are etched by using a resist pattern can be shortened, the use thereof is useful in cost performance and environmentally. <Method for Manufacturing a Touch Panel> The positive-type photosensitive resin composition according to the present embodiment can suitably be utilized for a method for manufacturing a touch panel. The method for manufacturing a touch panel according to the present embodiment comprises a step of subjecting the base material having the resist pattern formed by the method for forming a resist pattern to an etching treatment. The etching treatment is carried out on conductive layers and the like of the base material with the formed resist pattern being used as masks. By forming a pattern of lead wiring and transparent electrodes by the etching treatment, the touch panel is manufactured. Hereinafter, in comparison with the case of using a negative-type photosensitive resin composition, there will be described a method for manufacturing a touch panel using the positive-type photosensitive resin composition according to the present embodiment. FIG. 2 is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating a method for manufacturing a touch panel using a negative-type photosensitive resin composition. This method comprises a first step of forming a resist pattern 29 composed of a cured material of a photosensitive resin composition on a metal layer 26 of a laminated base material having a support base material 22, a transparent conductive layer 24 provided on one surface of the support base material 22, and the metal layer 26 provided on the transparent conductive layer 24, a second step of etching the metal layer 26 and the transparent conductive layer 24 to thereby form a laminated pattern (24+26 in FIG. 2(d)) composed of remaining portions of the transparent conductive layer 24 and remaining portions of the metal layer 26, and a third step of removing the metal layer from a part of the laminated pattern to thereby form transparent electrodes composed of the remaining portions of the transparent conductive layer 24 and metal wirings composed of remaining portions of the metal layer. In the first step, first, as illustrated in FIG. 2(a), a negative-type photosensitive layer 28 using the negative-type photosensitive resin composition is laminated on the metal layer 26 of the laminated base material having the support base material 22, the transparent conductive layer 24 provided on one surface of the support base material 22, and the metal layer 26 provided on the transparent conductive layer 24. The photosensitive layer 28 may have a support film on the surface thereof opposite to the metal layer 26. The metal layer 26 includes metal layers containing copper, an alloy of copper and nickel, a molybdenum-aluminum-molybdenum laminated body, an alloy of silver, palladium and copper, or the like. The transparent conductive layer 24 contains an indium tin oxide (ITO). Then, a partial region of the photosensitive layer 28 is irradiated with an active light beam and cured to thereby form a cured material region, and the region excluding the cured material region of the photosensitive layer is removed from on the laminated base material. Thereby, as illustrated in FIG. 2(b), the resist pattern 29 is formed on the laminated base material. In the second step, by the etching treatment, the metal layer 26 and the transparent conductive layer 24 which are not masked with the resist pattern 29 are removed from on the support base material 22. A method of the etching treatment is suitably selected according to layers to be removed. Examples of an etching solution to remove the metal layer include a cupric chloride solution, a ferric chloride solution and a phosphoric acid solution. Further as an etching solution to remove the transparent conductive layer, there is used oxalic acid, hydrochloric acid, aqua regia or the like. FIG. 2( c) is a view illustrating a state after the etching treatment; and a laminated body composed of remaining portions of the metal layer 26, remaining portions of the transparent conductive layer 24 and remaining portions of the photosensitive layer 28 is formed on the support base material 22. In the manufacture method according to the present embodiment, the resist pattern 29 is removed from this laminated body. For the removal of the resist pattern 29, for example, an aqueous solution having a stronger alkalinity than the alkali aqueous solution used in the above-mentioned development step can be used. As the strong-alkali aqueous solution, there is used a 1 to 10-mass % sodium hydroxide aqueous solution, a 1 to 10-mass % potassium hydroxide aqueous solution, or the like. Among these, it is preferable to use a 1 to 10-mass % sodium hydroxide aqueous solution, or a 1 to 10-mass % potassium hydroxide aqueous solution; and it is more preferable to use 1 to 5-mass % sodium hydroxide aqueous solution, or a 1 to 5-mass % potassium hydroxide aqueous solution. A method for stripping the resist pattern includes an immersion method, a spray method and the like, and these may be used singly or in a combination. FIG. 2( d) is a view illustrating a state after the stripping of the resist pattern 29; and the laminated pattern composed of remaining portions of the metal layer 26 and remaining portions of the transparent conductive layer 24 is formed on the support base material 22. In the third step, portions of the metal layer 26 excluding portions thereof for forming the metal wirings are removed from the laminated pattern to thereby form the metal wirings composed of remaining portions of the metal layer 26 and the transparent electrodes composed of the remaining portions of the transparent conductive layer 24. In the method of using the negative-type photosensitive resin composition, and in the case where the transparent conductive layer 24 is intended to be partially exposed by multi-stage etching, a photosensitive layer needs to be again formed. That is, in the third step, first, a photosensitive layer 30 using a negative-type photosensitive resin composition is formed on the laminated base material having undergone the second step (FIG. 2(e)). Then, through an exposure and a development of the photosensitive layer 30, a resist pattern 31 composed of a cured material of the photosensitive layer 30 is formed (FIG. 2(f)). Then, the metal layer 26 is removed from portions where the resist pattern 31 is not formed out of the laminated pattern by an etching treatment. At this time, as an etching solution, the same etching solution as the above-mentioned etching solution to remove the metal layer can be used. FIG. 2( g) is a view illustrating a state after the etching treatment; and the transparent electrodes composed of remaining portions of the transparent conductive layer 24 are formed on the support base material 22, and a laminated body composed of the metal layer 26 and the resist pattern 31 is formed on a part of the transparent electrodes. By removing the resist pattern 31 from the laminated body, as illustrated in FIG. 2(h), the transparent electrodes composed of the remaining portions of the transparent conductive layer 24 and the metal wirings composed of remaining portions of the metal layer 26 are formed on the support base material 22. By contrast, in a method of using the positive-type photosensitive resin composition according to the present embodiment, and in the case where the transparent conductive layer 24 is intended to be partially exposed by multi-stage etching, a step of again forming a photosensitive layer is not needed. In the case of a photosensitive layer to be formed from a positive-type photosensitive resin composition, since the photosensitive layer has a property in which portions thereof irradiated with light (exposed portions) can be removed with an alkali aqueous solution, and portions thereof not irradiated with light (unexposed portions) remain as a film, a pattern can be formed by again irradiating the remaining film with light. FIG. 3 is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating one embodiment of a method for manufacturing a touch panel using the positive-type photosensitive resin composition. In a first step, first, as illustrated in FIG. 3(a), a positive-type photosensitive layer 40 using the positive-type photosensitive resin composition is laminated on a metal layer 26 of a laminated base material having a support base material 22, a transparent conductive layer 24 provided on one surface of the support base material 22, and the metal layer 26 provided on the transparent conductive layer 24. The photosensitive layer 40 may have a support film on the surface thereof opposite to the metal layer 26. Then, a partial region of the photosensitive layer 40 is irradiated with an active light beam to thereby form exposed portions; and thereafter, the photosensitive layer of the exposed portions is removed from on the laminated base material by development. Thereby, as illustrated in FIG. 3(b), a resist pattern 40a composed of the photosensitive layer 40 of unexposed portions is formed on the laminated base material. In a second step, by an etching treatment, the metal layer 26 and the transparent conductive layer 24 which are not masked with the resist pattern 40a are removed from on the support base material 22. A method of the etching treatment is suitably selected according to layers to be removed. Examples of an etching solution to remove the metal layer include an ammonium persulfate solution, a sodium persulfate solution, a cupric chloride solution, a ferric chloride solution and a phosphoric acid solution. Further as an etching solution to remove the transparent conductive layer, there is used oxalic acid, hydrochloric acid, aqua regia or the like. FIG. 3( c) is a view illustrating a state after the etching treatment; and a laminated body composed of remaining portions of the metal layer 26, remaining portions of the transparent conductive layer 24, and the resist pattern 40a is formed on the support base material 22. Then, in a third step, a partial region of the resist pattern 40a is irradiated with an active light beam to thereby form exposed portions, and thereafter, the photosensitive layer of the exposed portions is removed from on the laminated base material by development. Thereby, as illustrated in FIG. 3(d), a resist pattern composed of a resist pattern 40b of unexposed portions is formed on the laminated base material. Then, by an etching treatment, the metal layer 26 is removed from portions where the resist pattern 40b is not formed out of the laminated pattern. At this time, as an etching solution, the same etching solution as the above-mentioned etching solution to remove the metal layer can be used. FIG. 3( e) is a view illustrating a state after the etching treatment; and the transparent electrodes composed of the remaining portions of the transparent conductive layer 24 are formed on the support base material 22, and a laminated body composed of the metal layer 26 and the resist pattern 40b is formed on a part of the transparent electrodes. By removing the resist pattern 40b from the laminated body, as illustrated in FIG. 3(f), the transparent electrodes composed of the remaining portions of the transparent conductive layer 24 and metal wirings composed of remaining portions of the metal layer 26 are formed on the support base material 22. In such a way, in the method for manufacturing a touch panel according to the present embodiment, steps corresponding to the steps (d) and (e) in FIG. 2 are not needed. Here, although the transparent conductive layer 24 contains an indium tin oxide (ITO), the positive-type photosensitive resin composition according to the present embodiment can suitably be used also for a method for manufacturing a touch panel in which the transparent conductive layer 24 is altered from the ITO to a metal mesh. FIG. 4 is a top view illustrating one embodiment of a touch panel 100 obtained by utilizing the present invention. In the touch panel 100, X electrodes 52 and Y electrodes 54 as transparent electrodes are alternately juxtaposed; the X electrodes 52 installed in a same row in the longitudinal direction are connected to one another by one lead wiring 56; and the Y electrodes 54 installed in a same row in the width direction are connected to one another by one lead wiring 57. The preferred embodiments according to the present invention is described, but the present invention is not limited to the above embodiments. Various modifications and changes in the present invention may be made without departing from its gist.

First, the photosensitive resin composition was applied on the release treatment-subjected surface of a PET film “Purex A53” (manufactured by Teijin DuPont Films Japan Ltd., trade name, having a film thickness of 25 μm, a 180° peel strength at 23° C. of 100 g/inch as using an adhesive tape “NITTO 31B” manufactured by Nitto Denko Corp., and a surface tension of the release treatment-subjected surface of 44 mN/m), one surface of which was subjected to a release treatment with a silicone-based compound, by using a spin coater (manufactured by Daitron Technology Co., Ltd.) under the condition of 300 rpm and for 10 sec and then under the condition of 500 rpm and for 30 sec. Then, the applied photosensitive resin composition was dried at 95° C. for 5 min in a conveyer-type drying machine (RCP Oven Line, manufactured by Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd.) to thereby fabricate a photosensitive film having a photosensitive layer of 4.0 μm in thickness formed thereon. The photosensitive layer of the photosensitive film was laminated on a substrate by using a roll laminator (manufactured by Hitachi Chemical Techno-Plant Co., Ltd.) under the condition of a pressure of 0.5 MPa, upper and lower roll temperatures of 120° C., and a speed of 0.5 m/min, to thereby obtain a positive-type photoresist laminated body. By using the obtained positive-type photoresist laminated body, the photosensitive layer was exposed and developed in the order of the following steps 1 to 3. (Step 1) The PET film was peeled off the positive-type photoresist laminated body, and the photosensitive layer was exposed by using a UV exposing machine (manufactured by Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd., trade name: “Large Manual Exposing Machine MAP-1200”) under the condition of 100 mJ/cm2. For the pattern formation, a glass mask (manufactured by Toppan Printing Co., Ltd., trade name: “TOPPAN-TEST-CHART-NO1-N L78I1”) was used. Then, as a developing solution, a 0.7-mass % KOH (potassium hydroxide) aqueous solution was used; and the photosensitive layer was developed at 25° C. for a predetermined time by using a spray-type developing apparatus (manufactured by Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd., trade name: “DVW-911”), washed with distilled water, and thereafter dried by a nitrogen blow to thereby form a resist film 1. (Step 2) A half of the resist film 1 remaining in the step 1 was covered with a black sheet, and the resist film 1 was exposed under the condition of 100 mJ/cm2 as in the step 1. The resist film 1 was developed using a 0.7-mass % KOH developing solution by a spray developing machine at 25° C. for a predetermined time as in the step 1, washed with distilled water, and thereafter dried by a nitrogen blow to thereby form a resist film 2. (Step 3) The whole surface of the resist film 2 remaining in the step 2 was exposed under the condition of 100 mJ/cm2 as in the step 1. The resist film 2 was developed using a 0.7-mass % KOH aqueous solution by a spray developing machine at 25° C. for a predetermined time as in the step 1, and washed with distilled water. The resist film 2 was thereafter dried by a nitrogen blow. Example 13 The photosensitive resin composition prepared in Example 1 was applied directly on a copper substrate by using a spin coater (manufactured by Daitron Technology Co., Ltd.) under the condition of 300 rpm and for 10 sec and then under the condition of 500 rpm and for 30 sec, and dried at 95° C. for 5 min in a conveyer-type drying machine (RCP Oven Line, manufactured by Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd.) to thereby obtain a positive-type photoresist laminated body. By using the obtained positive-type photoresist laminated body and carrying out the operations of the above steps 1 to 3, the photosensitive layer was exposed and developed. <Evaluation of the Photosensitive Layer> The flexibility and the adhesivity of the photosensitive layer formed on the support film, and the repeated developability of the photosensitive layer in the steps 1 to 3 were evaluated according to the following criteria.

Specifically, the cutting property of pattern edge parts, the development residues of solid portions, the adherence of stripped pieces and stringy residues on the substrate were evaluated in five ranks using the following criteria. Here, the term “edge parts” refers to edge parts of a resist pattern of unexposed portions on the adhesion surface of the substrate; the term “good cutting property” indicates a shape following the photomask, and indicates that the cross-sectional shape of the resist pattern is rectangular; and the term of “poor cutting property” indicates that the cross-sectional shape of the resist pattern is not rectangular. A: good cutting property of pattern edge parts, no development residues on solid portions, no stripped pieces, no stringy residues B: poor cutting property of pattern edge parts, no development residues on solid portions, no stripped pieces, no stringy residues C: poor cutting property of pattern edge parts, no development residues on solid portions, no stripped pieces, stringy residues being present D: poor cutting property of pattern edge parts, development residues being present on solid portions, no stripped pieces, stringy residues being present E: poor cutting property of pattern edge parts, development residues being present on solid portions, stripped pieces being present, stringy residues being present (Developing Solution Resistance) The developing solution resistance of the unexposed portions of the photosensitive layer in the steps 1 and 2 was evaluated according to the following criteria.
