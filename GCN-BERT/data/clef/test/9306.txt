Step 3: Synthesis of methyl 4-(4-(7-hydroxyhepta-1,3-diyn-1-yl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate
To a solution of 7-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)hepta-4,6-diyn-1-ol hydrochloride (900 mg, 1 eq) in DMF (20 ml) wad added with N,N-diisopropylethylamine (2.79 ml, 4 eq) and methyl 4-bromo-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate (Intermediate 1) (2.18 g, 2 eq). The mixture was stirred for 12 hr at 60Â° C., cooled down to room temperature, and extracted with ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (300 mg, 19.8%).
