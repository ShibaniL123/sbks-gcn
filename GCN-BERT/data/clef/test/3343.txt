The present invention concerns novel antibiotic derivatives, a pharmaceutical antibacterial composition containing them and the use of these compounds in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of infections (e.g. bacterial infections). These compounds are useful antimicrobial agents effective against a variety of human and veterinary pathogens including among others Gram positive and Gram negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and mycobacteria. The intensive use of antibiotics has exerted a selective evolutionary pressure on micro-organisms to produce genetically based resistance mechanisms. Modern medicine and socio-economic behaviour exacerbates the problem of resistance development by creating slow growth situations for pathogenic microbes, e.g. in artificial joints, and by supporting long-term host reservoirs, e.g. in immuno-compromised patients. In hospital settings, an increasing number of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp., and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, major sources of infections, are becoming multi-drug resistant and therefore difficult if not impossible to treat: S. atreus is resistant to ß-lactams, quinolones and now even to vancomycin;S. pneumoniae is becoming resistant to penicillin or quinolone antibiotics and even to new macrolides;Enteroccocci are quinolone and vancomycin resistant and ß-lactam antibiotics are inefficacious against these strains;Enterobacteriacea are cephalosporin and quinolone resistant;P. aeruginosa are ß-lactam and quinolone resistant. Further new emerging organisms like Acinetobacter spp. or Clostridium difficile, which have been selected during therapy with the currently used antibiotics, are becoming a real problem in hospital settings. In addition, microorganisms that are causing persistent infections are increasingly being recognized as causative agents or cofactors of severe chronic diseases like peptic ulcers or heart diseases. Certain antibacterial agents are known from WO 2006/081289, but these agents do not contain an oxazolidinone moiety. Further antibacterial agents are disclosed in WO 2002/050040, but in these agents the piperazine ring is not directly bound to the quinoline analog moiety. Certain oxazolidinone derivatives having effects on the central nervous system are known from EP0300272.

Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvents used, but such conditions can be determined by a person skilled in the art by routine optimisation procedures. Sections a) to f) hereafter describe general methods for preparing compounds of formula (I). The preparation of elaborated intermediates and basic building blocks is described thereafter. General synthetic methods used repeatedly throughout the schemes below are referenced to and described in the end of this section. If not indicated otherwise, the generic groups or integers U, V, W, X, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, Ra, Rb, Rc, Rd, Re, Rf, Rg, Rh, A, B, D, E, G, m and n are as defined for formula (I). Other abbreviations used are defined in the experimental section. In some instances the generic groups R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, Ra, Rb, Rc, Rd, Re, Rf, Rg, Rh, A, B, D or E might be incompatible with the assembly illustrated in the schemes below and so will require the use of protecting groups (PG). The use of protecting groups is well known in the art (see for example "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", T.W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience, 1999). For the purposes of this discussion, it will be assumed that such protecting groups as are necessary are in place. a) Compounds of formula (I) can be obtained by reacting a compound of formula (II) with a carbonic acid derivative of formula (III), wherein L0 and L00 both represent chloro, OCCl3, imidazolyl or succinimidyloxy, or L0 represents chloro and L00 represents OCCl3. This reaction is preferably carried out in a dry aprotic solvent such as DCM or THF in presence of an organic base such as TEA or pyridine and at a temperature range between -30°C and +80°C. In case there is one or two free amino or alcohol functions on A, B, D or E, these functional groups are protected [see general synthetic method 1 and 2] prior to the reaction and the protecting groups removed thereafter [see general synthetic method 3 and 10].b) Compounds of formula (I) can be obtained by reacting a compound of formula (IV) with the anion generated from compound of formula (V), wherein R represents alkyl or benzyl, with a base such as KHMDS.

In case Rz represents hydrogen, the nitrogen atom may subsequently be further alkylated following [general synthetic method 11] or, preferably, using standard reductive amination procedures. In scheme 1, Rz represents hydrogen, Rb, Rc, Re, Rf or Rg as defined for formula (I), o represents the integer 0 or 1 and p represents the integer 0 or 1.e) Compounds of formula (I) wherein B represents CH, D represents *-CONH- wherein the asterisk indicates the bond which is attached to B, and E represents CH2 or CH2-CH2 can be obtained according to scheme 2 by reacting a compound of formula (XIA) with a compound of formula (XA), wherein o represents the integer 0 or 1 following [general synthetic method 8]. f) Compounds of formula (I) can be obtained by reacting a compound of formula (IVA) with a compound of formula L1-G, wherein L1 represents OTf or halogen such as bromine or iodine.

In particular by using CuI and 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane in presence of CsCO3 (Org. Let. 2006, 8, 5609-5612), or Pd(OAc)2 and DPEphos in presence of K3PO4. In case G represents 2-pyridinyl, the reaction is performed in presence of a NaH. ELABORATED INTERMEDIATES Compounds of formulae (II) and (IV) can be obtained as described in scheme 3. The vinyl derivatives of formula (XIII) are transformed into the corresponding epoxides of formula (IV) either through direct epoxidation of the terminal double bond with a peracide such as mCPBA or H2O2 in presence of an inorganic base such as NaOH, NaHCO3 or urea or via cis-dihydroxylation with OsO4/NMO following [general synthetic method 9], or as described in Tetrahedron Lett. 1976, 23, 1973-76, followed by conversion into the corresponding epoxides after mesylation or tosylation, and ring closure under basic conditions such as K2CO3 or NaOMe. In case chiral epoxides are required, they can be obtained by hydrolytic kinetic resolution (HKR) catalyzed by chiral (salen)-Co(III) complex (e.g. [(R,R)-N,N'-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylidene)-1,2-cyclohexanediaminato(2-)]cobalt(III) of the racemic mixture of epoxides as described by Jacobsen et al in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 1307-1315 and Science, 1997, 277, 936-938. Alternatively, the chiral epoxides can also be obtained from the ethylenic derivatives of formula (XIII) through either Shi chiral epoxidation using a chiral ketone as described Acc. Chem Res. 2004, 37, 488-496 or through chiral cis-dihydroxylation using AD mixtures in presence of methanesulfonamide in a water/2-methyl-2-propanol mixture as described in Chem. Rev. 1994, 94, 2483. The sense of induction relies on the chiral ligand contained in the mixture, either a dihydroquinine-based ligand in AD-mix α or a dihydroquinidine-based ligand in AD-mix β [see general synthetic method 9] In the particular case wherein the group -D-E- represents -CH2-NH-CH2- or -NH-CH2-, the epoxide of formula (IV) can also be obtained by reacting the amines of formula (XI) with epichlorhydrin, or optionally with one of the two enantiomers of epichlorhydrin, followed by protection of the amine function with a benzyloxycarbonyl or a tert-butoxycarbonyl group following [general synthetic method 1], epoxide formation after basic treatment and removal of the transient amino protecting group following [general synthetic method 10]. The epoxides of formula (IV) are reacted with amines of formula G-NH2 affording compounds of formula (II).

The intermediate ketals are transformed into the corresponding ketone following [general synthetic method 12]. Compounds of formula (VI) are obtained as described in scheme 5. The vinyl derivatives (XX), wherein PG represents a nitrogen protecting group such as benzyloxycarbonyl or tert-butoxycarbonyl, are transformed into the oxazolidinones (XXI) using one of the methods described in a) or b). The protecting group of compounds of formula (XXI) are removed to afford compounds of formula (VI) following [general synthetic method 10]. BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS Compounds of formula (X) wherein o represents the integer 0 or 1, L2 represents O-Ms, O-Tf, O-Ts, chloro, bromo or iodo are obtained from the corresponding alcohol derivatives of formula (XXVI) following [general synthetic method 7], the latter being obtained as shown in scheme 6. Compounds of formula (X) can in turn be transformed to the corresponding amines of formula (XA) via reaction with sodium azide and subsequent hydrogenation in presence of a noble metal catalyst.. PG represents -C(O)R, wherein R represents alkyl, or a silyl protecting group such as tert-butyldimethylsilyl-. The known epoxide derivatives (XXV), wherein PG represents -C(O)R and o represents the integer 0, are reacted with the anion of the carbamate of formula (V) generated by the action of a strong base such as n-BuLi between -80°C and-30°C, affording the alcohols of formula (XXVI).

The required quinoline, [1,5]-naphthyridine, quinazoline and quinoxaline derivatives of formula (VII) wherein L1 represents Br are either commercially available or prepared following literature procedures. For example, compounds wherein L1 = Br, W = N and X = V = U= CH are prepared according to WO 2003/087098, compounds wherein L1 = Br, W = V = N and X = U = CH are prepared according to WO 2006/032466, compounds wherein L1 = Br, X = N and U = V= W = CH or wherein L1 = Cl, W = N and X = V= U= CH are prepared according to WO 2004/089947, and compounds wherein L1 = Cl, V = N and X = W = U = CH are prepared according to WO 2005/019215.

These sulfonates can be reacted with sodium iodide in acetone or DMF between +40°C and +120°C delivering the corresponding iodo derivatives. Once activated (either as a sulfonate or a iodo derivative), the alcohol reacts with an amine as described in [general synthetic method 11]. General synthetic method 8: amide coupling The carboxylic acid is reacted with the amine in presence of an activating agent such as DCC, EDC, HOBT, n-propylphosphonic cyclic anhydride, HATU or di-(N-succinimidyl)-carbonate, in a dry aprotic solvent such as DCM, MeCN or DMF between -20°C and +60°C (see G.

Section nitriles, carboxylic acids and derivatives p.1653-1655. Among them, potassium permanganate in an acetone-water mixture (see Synthesis 1987, 85) or sodium chlorite in 2-methyl-2-propanol in presence of 2-methyl-2-butene (see Tetrahedron 1981, 37, 2091-2096) are frequently used. Alcohols can be directly oxydized into their corresponding acids by a variety of methods as described in Comprehensive Organic Transformations.

Chem. 1978, 43, 2480-2482) or Dess Martin (see D.B. Dess and J.C. Martin, J. Org. Chem. 1983, 48, 4155) conditions, respectively Alternatively the esters can be transformed into their corresponding aldehydes by controlled reduction with a bulky hydride reagent such as DIBAH. General synthetic method 15: hydrolysis of ester into carboxylic acids When the ester side chain is a linear alkyl, the hydrolysis is usually performed by treatment with an alkali hydroxide such as LiOH, KOH or NaOH in a water-dioxane or water - THF mixture between 0°C and +80°C. When the ester side chain is tert-butyl, the hydrolysis can also be performed in neat TFA or diluted TFA or HCl in an organic solvent such as ether or THF. When the ester side chain is the allyl group, the reaction is performed in presence of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) in presence of an Π-allyl cation scavenger such as morpholine, dimedone or tributyltin hydride between 0°C and +50°C in a solvent such as THF. When the ester side chain is benzyl, the reaction is performed under hydrogen in presence of a noble metal catalyst such as Pd/C in a solvent such as MeOH, THF or EA.
