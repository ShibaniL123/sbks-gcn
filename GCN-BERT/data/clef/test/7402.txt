Synthesis of (R)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one Hydrochloride
A solution of hydrogen chloride in diethyl ether (2.0 N, 0.281 mL, 0.562 mmol) was added to a solution of (R)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-y1)propan-1-one (0.0594 g, 0.225 mmol) in diethyl ether (2.3 mL) at 0Â° C. The reaction liquid was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour and then stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. The white solid precipitated was filtered and collected, washed with diethyl ether and dried at room temperature to obtain (R)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one hydrochloride (0.0492 g, 0.146 mmol, 65%)(hereinafter referred to as the compound of Example 15) as a white solid.
ESI-MS: as (R)-1-(3-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one: m/z=265 (M+H)+.
