BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The activity of cells can be regulated by external signals that stimulate or inhibit intracellular events. The process by which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response is referred to as signal transduction. Over the past decades, cascades of signal transduction events have been elucidated and found to play a central role in a variety of biological responses. Defects in various components of signal transduction pathways have been found to account for a vast number of diseases, including numerous forms of cancer, inflammatory disorders, metabolic disorders, vascular and neuronal diseases (Gaestel et al. Current Medicinal Chemistry (2007) 14:2214-2234). Kinases represent a class of important signaling molecules. Kinases can generally be classified into protein kinases and lipid kinases, and certain kinases exhibit dual specificities. Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins and/or themselves (i.e., autophosphorylation). Protein kinases can be generally classified into three major groups based upon their substrate utilization: tyrosine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine residues (e.g., erb2, PDGF receptor, EGF receptor, VEGF receptor, src, abl), serine/threonine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on serine and/or threonine residues (e.g., mTorC1, mTorC2, ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Akt), and dual-specificity kinases which phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine, serine and/or threonine residues. Lipid kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids within cells. These enzymes, and the resulting phosphorylated lipids and lipid derived biologically active organic molecules, play a role in many different physiological processes, including cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and differentiation. A particular group of lipid kinases comprises membrane lipid kinases, i.e., kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids contained in or associated with cell membranes. Examples of such enzymes include phosphinositide(s) kinases (such as PI3-kinases, PI4-Kinases), diacylglycerol kinases, and sphingosine kinases. The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) signaling pathway is one of the most highly mutated systems in human cancers. PI3K signaling is involved in many other disease states including allergic contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, disorders related to diabetic complications, and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome. PI3Ks are members of a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3'-OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family comprises 15 kinases with distinct substrate specificities, expression patterns, and modes of regulation (Katso et al., 2001). The class I PI3Ks (p110α, p110β, p110δ, and p110γ) are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors to generate PIP3, which engages downstream effectors such as the Akt/PDK1 pathway, mTOR, the Tec family kinases, and the Rho family GTPases. The class II and III PI3-Ks play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P2. The production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate initiates potent growth and survival signals. In some epithelial cancers the PI3K pathway is activated by direct genetic mutation. Additionally, the PI3K signaling pathway appears to be a crucial survival and growth signal in a broad spectrum of cancers. As PI3K signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation and differentiation, inhibition of this pathway is believed to be beneficial in hyperproliferative diseases. Downstream mediators of the PI3K signal transduction pathway include Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Akt posseses a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds PIP3, leading to Akt kinase activation. Akt phosphorylates many substrates and is a central downstream effector of PI3K for diverse cellular responses. Full activation of Akt typically requires phosphorylation of T308 in the activation loop and S473 in a hydrophobic motif. One important function of Akt is to augment the activity of mTOR, through phosphorylation of TSC2 and other mechanisms. mTOR is a serine-threonine kinase related to the lipid kinases of the PI3K family. mTOR has been implicated in a wid range of biological processes including cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility and survival. Disregulation of the mTOR pathway has been reported in various types of cancer. mTOR is a multifunctional kinase that integrates growth factor and nutrient signals to regulate protein translation, nutrient uptake, autophagy, and mitrochondrial function. mTOR exists in two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 contains the raptor subunit and mTORC2 contains rictor. These complexes are differentially regulated, and have distinct substrate specificities and rapamycin sensitivity. For example, mTORC1 phosphorylates S6 kinase (S6K) and 4EBP1, promoting increased translation and ribosome biogenesis to facilitate cell growth and cell cycle progression. S6K also acts in a feedback pathway to attenuate PI3K/Akt activation. mTORC2 is generaly insensitive to rapamycin. mTORC2 is though to modulate growth factor signaling by phosphorylating the C-terminal hydrophobic motif of some AGC kinases such as Akt. In many cellular contexts, mTORC2 is required for phosphorylation of the S473 site of Akt. Dysregulation of signaling pathways mediated by many other kinases is a key factor in the development of human diseases. Aberrant or excessive protein kinase activity or expression has been observed in many disease states including benign and malignant proliferative diseases, disorders such as allergic contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, disorders related to diabetic complications, and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome. As such, kinases particularly protein kinases such as mTor and lipid kinases such as PI3Ks are prime targets for drug development. WO 2007/114926 discloses i.a. pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives which are antagonists of PI3 kinase and tyrosine kinase, PDKinase and mTOR or PI3 kinase, mTOR and tyrosine kinase. The present invention addresses a need in the art by providing a new class of kinase inhibitors and various treatment methods.

The term "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" refers to that amount of a compound described herein that is sufficient to effect the intended application including but not limited to disease treatment, as defined below. The therapeutically effective amount may vary depending upon the intended application (in vitro or in vivo), or the subject and disease condition being treated, e.g., the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the disease condition, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The term also applies to a dose that will induce a particular response in target cells, e.g. reduction of platelet adhesion and/or cell migration. The specific dose will vary depending on the particular compounds chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, whether it is administered in combination with other compounds, timing of administration, the tissue to which it is administered, and the physical delivery system in which it is carried. The terms "treatment," "treating," "palliating," and "ameliorating" are used interchangeably herein. These terms refer to an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including but not limited to therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Also, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the eradication or amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the patient, notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For prophylactic benefit, the compositions may be administered to a patient at risk of developing a particular disease, or to a patient reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though a diagnosis of this disease may not have been made. A "therapeutic effect," as used herein, encompasses a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit as described above. A prophylactic effect includes delaying or eliminating the appearance of a disease or condition, delaying or eliminating the onset of symptoms of a disease or condition, slowing, halting, or reversing the progression of a disease or condition, or any combination thereof. The term "co-administration," "administered in combination with," and their grammatical equivalents, as used herein, encompass administration of two or more agents to an animal so that both agents and/or their metabolites are present in the animal at the same time. Co-administration includes simultaneous administration in separate compositions, administration at different times in separate compositions, or administration in a composition in which both agents are present. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to salts derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art and include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like; and when the molecule contains a basic functionality, salts of organic or inorganic acids, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, tartrate, mesylate, acetate, maleate, oxalate and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and organic acids.

"Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" or "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions of the invention is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. The terms "antagonist" and "inhibitor" are used interchangeably, and they refer to a compound having the ability to inhibit a biological function of a target protein, whether by inhibiting the activity or expression of the target protein. Accordingly, the terms "antagonist" and "inhibitors" are defined in the context of the biological role of the target protein. While preferred antagonists herein specifically interact with (e.g. bind to) the target, compounds that inhibit a biological activity of the target protein by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target protein is a member are also specifically included within this definition. A preferred biological activity inhibited by an antagonist is associated with the development, growth, or spread of a tumor, or an undesired immune response as manifested in autoimmune disease. The term "agonist" as used herein refers to a compound having the ability to initiate or enhance a biological function of a target protein, whether by inhibiting the activity or expression of the target protein. Accordingly, the term "agonist" is defined in the context of the biological role of the target polypeptide. While preferred agonists herein specifically interact with (e.g. bind to) the target, compounds that initiate or enhance a biological activity of the target polypeptide by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target polypeptide is a member are also specifically included within this definition. As used herein, "agent" or "biologically active agent" refers to a biological, pharmaceutical, or chemical compound or other moiety. Non-limiting examples include simple or complex organic or inorganic molecule, a peptide, a protein, an oligonucleotide, an antibody, an antibody derivative, antibody fragment, a vitamin derivative, a carbohydrate, a toxin, or a chemotherapeutic compound. Various compounds can be synthesized, for example, small molecules and oligomers (e.g., oligopeptides and oligonucleotides), and synthetic organic compounds based on various core structures. In addition, various natural sources can provide compounds for screening, such as plant or animal extracts, and the like. A skilled artisan can readily recognize that there is no limit as to the structural nature of the agents of the present invention. "Signal transduction" is a process during which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response. A modulator of a signal transduction pathway refers to a compound which modulates the activity of one or more cellular proteins mapped to the same specific signal transduction pathway. A modulator may augment (agonist) or suppress (antagonist) the activity of a signaling molecule. An "anti-cancer agent", "anti-tumor agent" or "chemotherapeutic agent" refers to any agent useful in the treatment of a neoplastic condition. One class of anti-cancer agents comprises chemotherapeutic agents. "Chemotherapy" means the administration of one or more chemotherapeutic drugs and/or other agents to a cancer patient by various methods, including intravenous, oral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravesical, subcutaneous, transdermal, buccal, or inhalation or in the form of a suppository. The term "cell proliferation" refers to a phenomenon by which the cell number has changed as a result of division. This term also encompasses cell growth by which the cell morphology has changed (e.g., increased in size) consistent with a proliferative signal. The term "selective inhibition" or "selectively inhibit" as applied to a biologically active agent refers to the agent's ability to selectively reduce the target signaling activity as compared to off-target signaling activity, via direct or interact interaction with the target. "mTorC1 and/or mTorC2 activity" as applied to a biologically active agent refers to the agent's ability to modulate signal transduction mediated by mTorC1 and/or mTorC2. For example, modulation of mTorC1 and/or mTorC2 activity is evidenced by alteration in signaling output from the PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway. The term "B-ALL" as used herein refers to B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. "Subject" refers to an animal, such as a mammal, for example a human. The methods described herein can be useful in both human therapeutics and veterinary applications. In some embodiments, the patient is a mammal, and in some embodiments, the patient is human. "Radiation therapy" means exposing a patient, using routine methods and compositions known to the practitioner, to radiation emitters such as alpha-particle emitting radionucleotides (e.g., actinium and thorium radionuclides), low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation emitters (i.e. beta emitters), conversion electron emitters (e.g. strontium-89 and samarium-153-EDTMP, or high-energy radiation, including without limitation x-rays, gamma rays, and neutrons. An "anti-cancer agent", "anti-tumor agent" or "chemotherapeutic agent" refers to any agent useful in the treatment of a neoplastic condition. One class of anti-cancer agents comprises chemotherapeutic agents. "Chemotherapy" means the administration of one or more chemotherapeutic drugs and/or other agents to a cancer patient by various methods, including intravenous, oral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravesical, subcutaneous, transdermal, buccal, or inhalation or in the form of a suppository. "Prodrug" is meant to indicate a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active compound described herein. Thus, the term "prodrug" refers to a precursor of a biologically active compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, e.g.,Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam). A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, T., et al., "Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems," A.C.S. Symposium Series, Vol. 14, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987. The term "prodrug" is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of an active compound, as described herein, may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide, formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like. The term "in vivo" refers to an event that takes place in a subject's body. The term "in vitro" refers to an event that takes places outside of a subject's body. For example, an in vitro assay encompasses any assay run outside of a subject assay. In vitro assays encompass cell-based assays in which cells alive or dead are employed. In vitro assays also encompass a cell-free assay in which no intact cells are employed. Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures wherein hydrogen is replaced by deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by 13C- or 14C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention. The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. When ranges are used herein for physical properties, such as molecular weight, or chemical properties, such as chemical formulae, all combinations and subcombinations of ranges and specific embodiments therein are intended to be included. The term "about" when referring to a number or a numerical range means that the number or numerical range referred to is an approximation within experimental variability (or within statistical experimental error), and thus the number or numerical range may vary from, for example, between 1% and 15% of the stated number or numerical range. The term "comprising" (and related terms such as "comprise" or "comprises" or "having" or "including") include those embodiments, for example, an embodiment of any composition of matter, composition, method, or process, or the like, that "consist of" or "consist essentially of" the described features. The following abbreviations and terms have the indicated meanings throughout: PI3-K = Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PI = phosphatidylinositol; PDK = Phosphoinositide Dependent Kinase; DNA-PK = Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid Dependent Protein Kinase; PIKK = Phosphoinositide Kinase Like Kinase; AIDS = Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome; TLC = Thin Layer Chromatography; MeOH = Methanol; and CHCl3 = Chloroform.

"Stereoisomers" are isomers that differ only in the way the atoms are arranged in space. "Enantiomers" are a pair of stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. A 1:1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers is a "racemic" mixture. The term "(.±.)" is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. "Diastereoisomers" are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms, but which are not mirror-images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog R-S system. When a compound is a pure enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon can be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated (+) or (-) depending on the direction (dextro- or levorotatory) which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that can be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-. The present chemical entities, pharmaceutical compositions and methods are meant to include all such possible isomers, including racemic mixtures, optically pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active (R)- and (S)- isomers can be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. The optical activity of a compound can be analyzed via any suitable method, including but not limited to chiral chromatography and polarimetry, and the degree of predominance of one stereoisomer over the other isomer can be determined. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. "Isothiocyanato" refers to a -NCS radical. "Mercaptyl" refers to a (alkyl)S- or (H)S- radical. "Moiety" refers to a specific segment or functional group of a molecule.

The R groups in -NRR of the -S(=O)2-NRR radical may be taken together with the nitrogen to which it is attached to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. In some embodiments, it is a C1-C10 sulfonamido, wherein each R in sulfonamido contains 1 carbon, 2 carbons, 3 carbons, or 4 carbons total.

"Tautomers" are structurally distinct isomers that interconvert by tautomerization. "Tautomerization" is a form of isomerization and includes prototropic or proton-shift tautomerization, which is considered a subset of acid-base chemistry. "Prototropic tautomerization" or "proton-shift tautomerization" involves the migration of a proton accompanied by changes in bond order, often the interchange of a single bond with an adjacent double bond. Where tautomerization is possible (e.g. in solution), a chemical equilibrium of tautomers can be reached. An example of tautomerization is keto-enol tautomerization. A specific example of keto-enol tautomerization is the interconversion of pentane-2,4-dione and 4-hydroxypent-3-en-2-one tautomers. Another example of tautomerization is phenol-keto tautomerization. A specific example of phenol-keto tautomerization is the interconversion of pyridin-4-ol and pyridin-4(1H)-one tautomers. The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. A "leaving group or atom" is any group or atom that will, under the reaction conditions, cleave from the starting material, thus promoting reaction at a specified site. Suitable examples of such groups unless otherwise specified are halogen atoms, mesyloxy, p-nitrobenzensulphonyloxy and tosyloxy groups. "Protecting group" has the meaning conventionally associated with it in organic synthesis, i.e. a group that selectively blocks one or more reactive sites in a multifunctional compound such that a chemical reaction can be carried out selectively on another unprotected reactive site and such that the group can readily be removed after the selective reaction is complete. A variety of protecting groups are disclosed, for example, in T.H. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, John Wiley & Sons, New York (1999). For example, a hydroxy protected form is where at least one of the hydroxy groups present in a compound is protected with a hydroxy protecting group. Likewise, amines and other reactive groups may similarly be protected. "Solvate" refers to a compound (e.g., a compound selected from Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) in physical association with one or more molecules of a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent. It will be understood that "a compound of Formula I" encompass the compound of Formula I and solvates of the compound, as well as mixtures thereof. "Thiocyanato" refers to a -CNS radical. "Thioxo" refers to the =S radical. "Substituted" means that the referenced group may be substituted with one or more additional group(s) individually and independently selected from acyl, alkyl, alkylaryl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl, carbohydrate, heteroaryl, heterocyclic, hydroxy, alkoxy, aryloxy, mercapto, alkylthio, arylthio, cyano, halo, carbonyl, ester, thiocarbonyl, isocyanato, thiocyanato, isothiocyanato, nitro, perhaloalkyl, perfluoroalkyl, phosphate, silyl, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, sulfonamidyl, sulfoxyl, sulfonate, and amino, including mono- and di-substituted amino groups, and the protected derivatives thereof. The subsituents themselves may be substituted, for example, a cycloakyl substituent may have a halide substituted at one or more ring carbons, and the like.The protecting groups that may form the protective derivatives of the above substituents are known to those of skill in the art and may be found in references such as Greene and Wuts, above. Where substituent groups are specified by their conventional chemical formulae, written from left to right, they equally encompass the chemically identical substituents that would result from writing the structure from right to left, e.g., -CH2O- is equivalent to -OCH2-. Compounds of the present invention also include crystalline and amorphous forms of those compounds, including, for example, polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs, solvates, hydrates, unsolvated polymorphs (including anhydrates), conformational polymorphs, and amorphous forms of the compounds, as well as mixtures thereof. "Crystalline form," "polymorph," and "novel form" may be used interchangeably herein, and are meant to include all crystalline and amorphous forms of the compound, including, for example, polymorphs, pseudopolymorphs, solvates, hydrates, unsolvated polymorphs (including anhydrates), conformational polymorphs, and amorphous forms, as well as mixtures thereof, unless a particular crystalline or amorphous form is referred to. "Solvent," "organic solvent," and "inert solvent" each means a solvent inert under the conditions of the reaction being described in conjunction therewith including, for example, benzene, toluene, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran ("THF"), dimethylformamide ("DMF"), chloroform, methylene chloride (or dichloromethane), diethyl ether, methanol, N-methylpyrrolidone ("NMP"), pyridine and the like. Unless specified to the contrary, the solvents used in the reactions described herein are inert organic solvents. Unless specified to the contrary, for each gram of the limiting reagent, one cc (or mL) of solvent constitutes a volume equivalent. Isolation and purification of the chemical entities and intermediates described herein can be effected, if desired, by any suitable separation or purification procedure such as, for example, filtration, extraction, crystallization, column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography or thick-layer chromatography, or a combination of these procedures. Specific illustrations of suitable separation and isolation procedures can be had by reference to the examples hereinbelow. However, other equivalent separation or isolation procedures can also be used.

The compounds disclosed herein may be prepared by the routes described below. Materials used herein are either commercially available or prepared by synthetic methods generally known in the art. These schemes are not limited to the compounds listed or by any particular substituents employed for illustrative purposes, but are useful generally for the compounds disclosed herein. Numbering does not necessarily correspond to that of claims or other tables. I. General Route of Synthesis Scheme 1 depicts the synthesis of 2-(4-amino-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl) iodide (Cpd. 1-3), an intermediate in the synthesis of the compounds and its further reactions to obtain final inhibitor analogs. Cyano substituted aminopyrazole 1-1 is heated with formamide at 160°C for 5 hours to yield 2-(4-amino-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (compound 1-2) in 90% yield. This intermediate is reacted with N-iodosuccinimide in dimethylformamide at 80°C for 16 hours, to produce 2-(4-amino-1R-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl iodide (Cpd. 1-3) in 90% yield. The pyrazolopyrimidinyl iodide, Cpd. 1-3, is reacted with a species RX in the presence of a base, where X is a good leaving group such as for example, a halide, including bromo, chloro or iodide, or a tosylate, or another moiety which will act as a leaving group under the reaction conditions. The "R" portion of the moiety is alkyl, heterocycloalkyl, alkylaryl, alkylheteroaryl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or cycloalkyl. The base is, for example, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium hydride, potassium tert-butoxide, and the like. The product, compound 1-4, incorporates a "R" moiety coupled to nitrogen, as shown. This intermediate is subjected to a Suzuki coupling, i.e. palladium catalyzed coupling between and iodide bearing compounds and a boronic acid, depicted as ArB(OH)2 to produce a compound of the invention, Cpd. 1-5, after deprotection. Many boronic acid analogs of formula ArB(OH)2 are commercially available, or may be synthesized as is known in the art, and may include heteroaromatic as well as carbocyclic aromatic moieties. II. Illustrative Syntheses of Compounds with 1-Isopropyl Substitution. Example 1. Synthesis of 2-(4-amino-1-isopropyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)-1H-indol-5-ol (Compound 2-4). Compound 2-4 is synthesized as shown in Scheme 2. Compound 1-3 is reacted with isopropyl bromide in dimethylformamide with potassium carbonate at 80°C, to provide the 1-isopropyl pyrazolopyrimidine 2-1. This intermediate with the protected indolyl boronic acid species 2-2, using tetrakistriphenylphosphine palladium catalysis in DME-water solvent at 80°C for 4-5 hours, to produce the Suzuki coupling product, compound 2-3. Removal of the protecting groups with acid in dioxane yields the product, 2-(4-amino-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl iodide (Cpd. 2-4). An alternative route to perform the Suzuki coupling is shown in Scheme 2-B. In this approach, methyl ether protection is used for the 5-hydroxy on the indolyl boronic acid. Palladium acetate and triphenylphosphine catalyze the coupling in the presence of sodium carbonate base to provide intermediate 2-6. Along with the desired product, some amount of partially de-protected product is also formed. The crude mixture is taken into the next step for complete Boc deprotection reaction with concentrated aqueous HCl in ethanol solution, and compound 2-7 is isolated as the HCl salt. The reaction is brought to approximately pH 8 with aqueous sodium carbonate to obtain the free base. Deprotection with borontribromide affords the final product, 2-(4-amino-1-isopropyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)-1H-indol-5-ol (Compound 2-4). This sequence can be generalized for other compounds of the invention. Example 2. 2-(4-amino-1-isopropyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)-1H-indole (Compound 3-3). Synthesis of 2-( 4-amino-1-isopropyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)-1H-indole (Compound 3-3) is accomplished via the same reactions as shown in Scheme 2, except that boronic acid 3-1 is used, as shown in Scheme 3. Example 3. The synthesis of 2-(4-amino-1-isopropyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)-1H-indol-7-ol (Compound 3-4) is accomplished via the same reactions as in Schemes 1 and 2-B, using a 7-methoxy indolyl boronic acid instead of the 5-methoxy indolyl species illustrated in Scheme 2-B. Alternatively, Compound 3-4 is synthesized via the reactions as in Schemes 1 and 2, using a 7- tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy (TBS) indolyl boronic acid instead of the 5-TBSO-indolyl species illustrated in Scheme 2. Example 4. The synthesis of 2-(4-amino-1-isopropyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)-1H-indol-6-ol (Compound 3-5) is accomplished via the same reactions as in Schemes 1 and 2-B, using a 6-methoxy indolyl boronic acid instead of the 5-methoxy indolyl species illustrated in Scheme 2-B. Alternatively, Compound 3-5 is synthesized via the reactions as in Schemes 1 and 2, using a 6- tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy (TBS) indolyl boronic acid instead of the 5-TBSO-indolyl species illustrated in Scheme 2. III. Illustrative Syntheses of Various Substituted Indolyl Boronic Acids Example 5. Synthesis of 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl) - 7 chloro- 5 methoxy-1H-indol-2-yl boronic acid is shown in Scheme 4. Meta- chlorophenol is nitrated with fuming nitric acid in acetic acid to yield 4- nitro-3-chlorophenol, compound 4-2. The phenol is methylated with dimethylsulfate and potassium carbonate in ethanol, producing compound 4-3, which is treated with vinyl Grignard reagent and cyclized to form the indole, compound 4-4. Compound 4-4 is protected with Boc and then treated with lithium diispropylamide and triisopropylborate to produce the protected substituted boronic acid 4-6. Example 6. Synthesis of 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)- 7-chloro-5 -methoxy-1H-indol-2-yl boronic acid (Cpd. 5-4) is shown in Scheme 5. Compound 4-2 is protected as the TBS ether, treated with vinyl Grignard reagent, and cyclized to yield compound 5-2. Boc protection is carried out, and introduction of the boronic acid is performed as described above, yielding compound 5-4. Example 7. Synthesis of 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-6-chloro- 5- methoxy-1H-indol-2yl boronic acid (Cpd. 6-7) is shown in Scheme 6. 3-Methyl- 5-chlorophenol is nitrated using sodium nitrate/nitric acid in an acetic acid/sulfuric acid mixture. The resulting 4-nitro phenol (Cpd. 6-2) is converted to the methyl protected species, compound 6-3, using dimethylsulfate in aqueous dioxane. Compound 6-3 is elaborated to form the vinylogous pyrrolidinyl intermediate, compound 6-4, via condensation with dimethyl acetal and pyrrolidine. Reduction of the nitro substituent with hydrazine and Raney nickel results in cyclization to indolyl analog 6-5. Boc protection and introduction of the boronic acid species as described above affords boronic acid 6-7. Example 8. The synthesis of 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl) -5-(tert-butyldimethylsiloxy) -4-chloro-1H-indol-2-yl boronic acid (Compound 7-7) is shown in Scheme 7. 4-Nitro-2-chlorophenol (cpd. 4-1) is protected as the benzyl ether, and converted to the mixture of compounds 7-2 and 7-3. Treatment with palladium on carbon under a hydrogen atmosphere reduces the nitro functionality, cyclizes the indole heterocyclic ring and removes the O-benzyl protection, to obtain compound 7-4. The hydroxyl is reprotected as the tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether 7-5, the indole nitrogen is protected with Boc (Cpd. 7-6), and subsequently treated with treated with lithium diispropylamide and triisopropylborate to produce the protected substituted boronic acid 7-7. Example 9. Synthesis of 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-4-chloro- 7-methoxy-1H-indol-2-yl boronic acid (Compound 8-5) is shown in Scheme 8. 4-Chloro-2 nitrophenol is methylated with dimethylsulfate in ethanol and in the presence of potassium carbonate. Vinyl Grignard reagent adds to the resulting methoxy compound, compound 8-2, which then cyclizes to obtain the indole of compound 8-3. Boc protection of the basic nitrogen and treatment with triisopropyl boronate produces boronic acid 8-5. The boronic acids illustrated herein, compounds, compounds 4-6, 5-4, 6-7, 7-7 and 8-5 are illustrative, but not limiting examples of the intermediates of use in the syntheses of compounds of the invention. Many other variants are made, using variants of the syntheses shown above. IV. Illustrative Syntheses of Other Compounds The following syntheses are illustrated with a 5-hydroxy indolyl moiety, but the disclosure encompasses all manner of substitutions as illustrated by the boronic acid syntheses above. Example 10. The synthesis of 2-(4-amino-1-(4-N-acetyl-piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)-1H-indol-4-ol (Compound 9-6) is accomplished as illustrated in Scheme 9. Acetic anhydride is used to protect the nitrogen of 4- hydroxy piperidine to obtain compound 9-2. Tosyl chloride, with triethylamine and dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) in methylene chloride is used to produce the tosylate 9-3. The iodopyrazolopyrimidine intermediate (compound 1-3) is reacted with tosylate 9-3 in dimethylformamide in the presence of cesium carbonate at 80°C to couple the piperidinyl moiety to the pyrazolopyrimidine molecule, yielding intermediate 9-4. Compound 9-4 is transformed via a Suzuki coupling with boronic acid 2-2 using dichloro[1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene] palladium II (PdCl2(dppf)) in aqueous DME, to obtain compound 9-5, which is deprotected under acidic conditions to yield compound 9-6. Example 11. The synthesis of 2-(4-amino-1-(1-(methylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl)-1H-pyrazolo [3, 4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)-1H-indol-5-ol (Compound 10-5) is illustrated in Scheme 10. 4-Hydroxypiperidine is reacted with methanesulfonyl chloride to produce compound 10-2. The mesylate of compound 10-2 is coupled with the pyrazolopyrimidine iodide (compound 1-3) to yield compound 10-3. Palladium catalyzed Suzuki coupling of boronic acid compound 2-2 with compound 10-3 yields the title compound (compound 10-5) after deprotection. Example 12. The synthesis of 2-(4-amino-1-(1-isopropylpiperidin-4-yl)-1H-pyrazolo [3, 4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)-1H-indol-5-ol (Compound 11-7) is described in Scheme 11. 4-Hydroxypiperidine is protected at nitrogen as the Boc derivative (compound 11-1), then converted to the tosylate (compound 11-2). The tosylate is reacted with pyrazolopyrimidine iodide (compound 1-3) in the presence of cesium carbonate as base, to produce compound 11-3. The Boc protection is removed under acidic conditions and the free amine (compound 11-4) is reacted with isopropyl bromide to yield compound 11-5. Example 13. The synthesis of 2-(4-amino-1-(3-morpholinocyclobutyl)-1H-pyrazolo [3, 4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)-1H-indol-5-ol (Compound 12-6) is described in Scheme 12. Bromocyclobutanone is produced from compound 12-1 by reaction with mercuric oxide and bromine, which is coupled with pyrazolopyrimidine iodide, compound 2-2, to yield compound 12-3. Reductive amination with morpholine affords compound 12-4. Compound 12-4 is then coupled with a boronic acid derivative to produce compound 12-6. Example 14. The synthesis of 2-(4-amino-1-(3-hydroxycyclobutyl)-1H-pyrazolo [3,4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)-1H-indol-5-ol (Compound 13-3) is described in Scheme 13. Intermediate 12-3 is reduced to the corresponding alcohol with sodium borohydride, yielding compound 13-1. Compound 13-1 is coupled with indolyl boronic acid 2-2 and produces compound 13-3 after deprotection under standard conditions. Example 15. The synthesis of 2-(4-amino-1-(34-hydroxycyclohexyl)-1H-pyrazolo [3, 4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl)-1H-indol-5-ol (Compound 14-9) is described in Scheme 14. 1, 4 cyclohexyldione is selectively monoketalized, then the remaining ketone is reduced with sodium borohydride to yield compound 14-3. The hydroxyl is converted to the tosylate (compound 14-4), which is then reacted with pyrazolopyrimidine iodide 1-3, to produce compound 14-5. The ketone of the cyclohexyl moiety is unmasked with acid treatment and reduced to hydroxy compound 14-7. Palladium catalyzed coupling with indolyl boronic acid and subsequent deprotection affords compound 14-9. Example 16. The synthesis of 2-(4-amino-1-(3-hydroxycyclobutyl)-1H-pyrazolo [3, 4-d]pyrimidin-3-yl) - 7 chloro -1H-indol-5-ol (Compound 15-2) is described in Scheme 15. The hydroxycyclobutyl pyrazolopyrimidine 13-1, synthesized as shown in Scheme 13, is reacted with the protected 7-chloro indolyl boronic acid species 5-5 under Suzuki coupling conditions. The product, compound 15-1, is deprotected with acid to remove both the tert-butyldimethylsilyl and Boc protection to produce compound 15-2. Reaction Schemes 16, 17 and 18 illustrate methods of synthesis of borane reagents useful in preparing intermediates of use in synthesis of the compounds of the invention as described above, to introduce heteroaryl substituents.

For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient such as, but not limited to, a binder, a lubricant, an inert diluent, and/or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. This invention further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water may be added (e.g., 5%) in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition may be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions may be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs. An active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the compositions for an oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as suspensions, solutions, and elixirs) or aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations, in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example, suitable carriers include powders, capsules, and tablets, with the solid oral preparations. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof. Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof. Disintegrants may be used in the compositions of the invention to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant may produce tablets which may disintegrate in the bottle. Too little may be insufficient for disintegration to occur and may thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient(s) from the dosage form. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient(s) may be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used may vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration, and may be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant, may be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other algins, other celluloses, gums or mixtures thereof. Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethylaureate, agar, or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel, a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica, or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added, in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the essential active ingredient therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various combinations thereof. The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil. Surfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, hydrophilic surfactants, lipophilic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. That is, a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants may be employed, a mixture of lipophilic surfactants may be employed, or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant may be employed. A suitable hydrophilic surfactant may generally have an HLB value of at least 10, while suitable lipophilic surfactants may generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non-ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (" HLB" value). Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic, and have greater solubility in oils, while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10, as well as anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly, lipophilic (i.e., hydrophobic) surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10. However, HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial, pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions. Hydrophilic surfactants may be either ionic or non-ionic. Suitable ionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, alkylammonium salts; fusidic acid salts; fatty acid derivatives of amino acids, oligopeptides, and polypeptides; glyceride derivatives of amino acids, oligopeptides, and polypeptides; lecithins and hydrogenated lecithins; lysolecithins and hydrogenated lysolecithins; phospholipids and derivatives thereof; lysophospholipids and derivatives thereof; carnitine fatty acid ester salts; salts of alkylsulfates; fatty acid salts; sodium docusate; acylactylates; mono- and di-acetylated tartaric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; succinylated mono- and di-glycerides; citric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; and mixtures thereof.

In one embodiment, the composition may include a solubilizer to ensure good solubilization and/or dissolution of the compound of the present invention and to minimize precipitation of the compound of the present invention. This can be especially important for compositions for non-oral use, e.g., compositions for injection. A solubilizer may also be added to increase the solubility of the hydrophilic drug and/or other components, such as surfactants, or to maintain the composition as a stable or homogeneous solution or dispersion. Examples of suitable solubilizers include, but are not limited to, the following: alcohols and polyols, such as ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, benzyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butanediols and isomers thereof, glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, transcutol, dimethyl isosorbide, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyvinylalcohol, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and other cellulose derivatives, cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin derivatives; ethers of polyethylene glycols having an average molecular weight of about 200 to about 6000, such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol PEG ether (glycofurol) or methoxy PEG ; amides and other nitrogen-containing compounds such as 2-pyrrolidone, 2-piperidone, .epsilon.-caprolactam, N-alkylpyrrolidone, N-hydroxyalkylpyrrolidone, N-alkylpiperidone, N-alkylcaprolactam, dimethylacetamide and polyvinylpyrrolidone; esters such as ethyl propionate, tributylcitrate, acetyl triethylcitrate, acetyl tributyl citrate, triethylcitrate, ethyl oleate, ethyl caprylate, ethyl butyrate, triacetin, propylene glycol monoacetate, propylene glycol diacetate, ε-caprolactone and isomers thereof, δ-valerolactone and isomers thereof, β-butyrolactone and isomers thereof; and other solubilizers known in the art, such as dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl isosorbide, N-methyl pyrrolidones, monooctanoin, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and water.

Particularly preferred solubilizers include sorbitol, glycerol, triacetin, ethyl alcohol, PEG-400, glycofurol and propylene glycol. The amount of solubilizer that can be included is not particularly limited. The amount of a given solubilizer may be limited to a bioacceptable amount, which may be readily determined by one of skill in the art. In some circumstances, it may be advantageous to include amounts of solubilizers far in excess of bioacceptable amounts, for example to maximize the concentration of the drug, with excess solubilizer removed prior to providing the composition to a patient using conventional techniques, such as distillation or evaporation. Thus, if present, the solubilizer can be in a weight ratio of 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%, or up to about 200% by weight, based on the combined weight of the drug, and other excipients. If desired, very small amounts of solubilizer may also be used, such as 5%, 2%, 1% or even less. Typically, the solubilizer may be present in an amount of about 1% to about 100%, more typically about 5% to about 25% by weight. The composition can further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable additives and excipients. Such additives and excipients include, without limitation, detackifiers, anti-foaming agents, buffering agents, polymers, antioxidants, preservatives, chelating agents, viscomodulators, tonicifiers, flavorants, colorants, odorants, opacifiers, suspending agents, binders, fillers, plasticizers, lubricants, and mixtures thereof. In addition, an acid or a base may be incorporated into the composition to facilitate processing, to enhance stability, or for other reasons. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable bases include amino acids, amino acid esters, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium aluminum silicate, synthetic aluminum silicate, synthetic hydrocalcite, magnesium aluminum hydroxide, diisopropylethylamine, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, triethanolamine, triethylamine, triisopropanolamine, trimethylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) and the like.

Pharmaceutical compositions for injection. In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for injection containing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for injection. Components and amounts of agents in the compositions are as described herein. The forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration by injection include aqueous or oil suspensions, or emulsions, with sesame oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs, mannitol, dextrose, or a sterile aqueous solution, and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Aqueous solutions in saline are also conventionally used for injection. Ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like (and suitable mixtures thereof), cyclodextrin derivatives, and vegetable oils may also be employed. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, for the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the compound of the present invention in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients as enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, certain desirable methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. Pharmaceutical compositions for topical (e.g., transdermal) delivery. In some embodiments, the inventio provides a pharmaceutical composition for transdermal delivery containing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for transdermal delivery. Compositions of the present invention can be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, or liquid forms suitable for local or topical administration, such as gels, water soluble jellies, creams, lotions, suspensions, foams, powders, slurries, ointments, solutions, oils, pastes, suppositories, sprays, emulsions, saline solutions, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-based solutions. In general, carriers with higher densities are capable of providing an area with a prolonged exposure to the active ingredients. In contrast, a solution formulation may provide more immediate exposure of the active ingredient to the chosen area. The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients, which are compounds that allow increased penetration of, or assist in the delivery of, therapeutic molecules across the stratum corneum permeability barrier of the skin. There are many of these penetration-enhancing molecules known to those trained in the art of topical formulation. Examples of such carriers and excipients include, but are not limited to, humectants (e.g., urea), glycols (e.g., propylene glycol), alcohols (e.g., ethanol), fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid), surfactants (e.g., isopropyl myristate and sodium lauryl sulfate), pyrrolidones, glycerol monolaurate, sulfoxides, terpenes (e.g., menthol), amines, amides, alkanes, alkanols, water, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols. Another exemplary formulation for use in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices ("patches"). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of a compound of the present invention in controlled amounts, either with or without another agent. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,023,252, 4,992,445 and 5,001,139. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Pharmaceutical compositions for inhalation. Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a face mask tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices that deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner. Other pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions may also be prepared from compositions described herein and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients suitable for sublingual, buccal, rectal, intraosseous, intraocular, intranasal, epidural, or intraspinal administration. Preparations for such pharmaceutical compositions are well-known in the art. See, e.g., See, e.g., Anderson, Philip O.; Knoben, James E.; Troutman, William G, eds., Handbook of Clinical Drug Data, Tenth Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2002; Pratt and Taylor, eds., Principles of Drug Action, Third Edition, Churchill Livingston, New York, 1990; Katzung, ed., Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, Ninth Edition, McGraw Hill, 20037ybg; Goodman and Gilman, eds., The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Tenth Edition, McGraw Hill, 2001; Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins., 2000; Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, Thirty-Second Edition (The Pharmaceutical Press, London, 1999). Administration of the compounds or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular, intraperitoneal or infusion), topical (e.g. transdermal application), rectal administration, via local delivery by catheter or stent or through inhalation. Compounds can also abe administered intraadiposally or intrathecally. The amount of the compound administered will be dependent on the mammal being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to 7 g/day, preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g. by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in a single dose. Typically, such administration will be by injection, e.g., intravenous injection, in order to introduce the agent quickly. However, other routes may be used as appropriate. A single dose of a compound of the invention may also be used for treatment of an acute condition. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in multiple doses. Dosing may be about once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, or more than six times per day. Dosing may be about once a month, once every two weeks, once a week, or once every other day. In another embodiment a compound of the invention and another agent are administered together about once per day to about 6 times per day. In another embodiment the administration of a compound of the invention and an agent continues for less than about 7 days. In yet another embodiment the administration continues for more than about 6, 10, 14, 28 days, two months, six months, or one year. In some cases, continuous dosing is achieved and maintained as long as necessary. Administration of the agents of the invention may continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered for more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, or 28 days. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered for less than 28, 14, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 day. In some embodiments, an agent of the invention is administered chronically on an ongoing basis, e.g., for the treatment of chronic effects. An effective amount of a compound of the invention may be administered in either single or multiple doses by any of the accepted modes of administration of agents having similar utilities, including rectal, buccal, intranasal and transdermal routes, by intra-arterial injection, intravenously, intraperitoneally, parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, orally, topically, or as an inhalant. The compositions of the invention may also be delivered via an impregnated or coated device such as a stent, for example, or an artery-inserted cylindrical polymer. Such a method of administration may, for example, aid in the prevention or amelioration of restenosis following procedures such as balloon angioplasty. Without being bound by theory, compounds of the invention may slow or inhibit the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall which contribute to restenosis. A compound of the invention may be administered, for example, by local delivery from the struts of a stent, from a stent graft, from grafts, or from the cover or sheath of a stent. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is admixed with a matrix. Such a matrix may be a polymeric matrix, and may serve to bond the compound to the stent. Polymeric matrices suitable for such use, include, for eample, lactone-based polyesters or copolyesters such as polylactide, polycaprolactonglycolide, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, polyaminoacids, polysaccharides, polyphosphazenes, poly (ether-ester) copolymers (e.g. PEO-PLLA); polydimethylsiloxane, poly(ethylene-vinylacetate), acrylate-based polymers or copolymers (e.g. polyhydroxyethyl methylmethacrylate, polyvinyl pyrrolidinone), fluorinated polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene and cellulose esters. Suitable matrices may be nondegrading or may degrade with time, releasing the compound or compounds. Compounds of the invention may be applied to the surface of the stent by various methods such as dip/spin coating, spray coating, dip-coating, and/or brush-coating. The compounds may be applied in a solvent and the solvent may be allowed to evaporate, thus forming a layer of compound onto the stent. Alternatively, the compound may be located in the body of the stent or graft, for example in microchannels or micropores. When implanted, the compound diffuses out of the body of the stent to contact the arterial wall. Such stents may be prepared by dipping a stent manufactured to contain such micropores or microchannels into a solution of the compound of the invention in a suitable solvent, followed by evaporation of the solvent. Excess drug on the surface of the stent may be removed via an additional brief solvent wash. In yet other embodiments, compounds of the invention may be covalently linked to a stent or graft. A covalent linker may be used which degrades in vivo, leading to the release of the compound of the invention. Any bio-labile linkage may be used for such a purpose, such as ester, amide or anhydride linkages. Compounds of the invention may additionally be administered intravascularly from a balloon used during angioplasty. Extravascular administration of the compounds via the pericard or via advential application of formulations of the invention may also be performed to decrease restenosis. A variety of stent devices which may be used as described are disclosed, for example, in the following references : U.S. Pat. No. 5451233; U.S. Pat. No. 5040548; U.S. Pat. No. 5061273; U.S. Pat. No. 5496346; U.S. Pat. No. 5292331; U.S. Pat. No. 5674278; U.S. Pat. No. 3657744; U.S. Pat. No. 4739762; U.S. Pat. No. 5195984; U.S. Pat. No. 5292331; U.S. Pat. No. 5674278; U.S. Pat. No. 5879382; U.S. Pat. No. 6344053. The compounds of the invention may be administered in dosages. It is known in the art that due to intersubject variability in compound pharmacokinetics, individualization of dosing regimen is necessary for optimal therapy. Dosing for a compound of the invention may be found by routine experimentation in light of the instant disclosure. When a compound of the invention, is administered in a composition that comprises one or more agents, and the agent has a shorter half-life than the compound of the invention unit dose forms of the agent and the compound of the invention may be adjusted accordingly. The subject pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral administration as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution, suspension, for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound according to the invention as an active ingredient. In addition, it may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc. Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compound in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose solutions.

EXAMPLES Example 1: Expression and Inhibition Assays of p110α/p85α, p110β/p85α, p110δ/p85α, and p110γ: Class I PI3-Ks can be either purchased (p110α/p85α, p110β/p85α, p110δ/p85α from Upstate, and p110γ from Sigma) or expressed as previously described (Knight et al., 2004). IC50 values are measured using either a standard TLC assay for lipid kinase activity (described below) or a high-throughput membrane capture assay. Kinase reactions are performed by preparing a reaction mixture containing kinase, inhibitor (2% DMSO final concentration), buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2), and freshly sonicated phosphatidylinositol (100 µg/ml). Reactions are initiated by the addition of ATP containing 10 µCi of γ-32P-ATP to a final concentration 10 or 100 µM and allowed to proceed for 5 minutes at room temperature. For TLC analysis, reactions are then terminated by the addition of 105 µl 1N HCl followed by 160 µl CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). The biphasic mixture is vortexed, briefly centrifuged, and the organic phase is transferred to a new tube using a gel loading pipette tip precoated with CHCl3. This extract is spotted on TLC plates and developed for 3 - 4 hours in a 65:35 solution of n-propanol:1M acetic acid. The TLC plates are then dried, exposed to a phosphorimager screen (Storm, Amersham), and quantitated. For each compound, kinase activity is measured at 10 - 12 inhibitor concentrations representing two-fold dilutions from the highest concentration tested (typically, 200 µM). For compounds showing significant activity, IC50 determinations are repeated two to four times, and the reported value is the average of these independent measurements. Other commercial kits or systems for assaying PI3-K activities are avaiable. The commercially available kits or systems can be used to screen for inhibitors and/or agonists of PI3-Ks including but not limited to PI 3-Kinase α, β, δ, and γ.

Briefly, the assay is a time resolved FRET assay that indirectly measures PIP3 product formed by the activity of a PI3-K. The kinase reaction is performed in a microtitre plate (e.g., a 384 well microtitre plate). The total reaction volume is approximately 20ul per well. In the first step, each well receives 2ul of test compound in 20% dimethylsulphoxide resulting in a 2% DMSO final concentration. Next, approximately 14.5ul of a kinase/PIP2 mixture (diluted in 1X reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of 0.25-0.3ug/ml kinase and 10uM PIP2. The plate is sealed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. To start the reaction, 3.5ul of ATP (diluted in 1X reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of 10uM ATP. The plate is sealed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by adding 5ul of Stop Solution per well and then 5ul of Detection Mix is added per well. The plate is sealed, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, and then read on an appropriate plate reader. Data is analyzed and IC50s are generated using GraphPad Prism 5.

Example 19: Microsome stability assay The stability of one or more subject compounds is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. For example, stability of one or more subject compounds is established by an in vitro assay. In particular, an in vitro microsome stability assay is established that measures stability of one or more subject compounds when reacting with mouse, rat or human microsomes from liver. The microsome reaction with compounds is performed in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Each tube contains 0.1 µL of 10.0 mg/ml NADPH; 75 µL of 20.0 mg/ml mouse, rat or human liver microsome; 0.4 µL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer, and 425 µL of ddH2O. Negative control (without NADPH) tube contains 75 µL of 20.0 mg/ml mouse, rat or human liver microsome; 0.4 µL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer, and 525 µL of ddH2O. The reaction is started by adding 1.0 µL of 10.0 mM tested compound. The reaction tubes are incubated at 37°C. 100 µL sample is collected into new Eppendorf tube containing 300 µL cold Methanol at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes of reaction. Samples are centrifuged at 15,000 rpm to remove protein. Supernatant of centrifuged sample is transferred to new tube. Concentration of stable compound after reaction with microsome in the supernatant is measured by Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Example 20: Plasma stability assay The stability of one or more subject compounds in plasma is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. See, e.g., Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom., 10: 1019-1026. The following procedure is an HPLC-MS/MS assay using human plasma; other species including monkey, dog, rat, and mouse are also available. Frozen, heparinized human plasma is thawed in a cold water bath and spun for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm at 4 °C prior to use. A subject compound is added from a 400 µM stock solution to an aliquot of pre-warmed plasma to give a final assay volume of 400 µL (or 800 µL for half-life determination), containing 5 µM test compound and 0.5 % DMSO. Reactions are incubated, with shaking, for 0 minutes and 60 minutes at 37 °C, or for 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes at 37 C for half life determination. Reactions are stopped by transferring 50 µL of the incubation mixture to 200 µL of ice-cold acetonitrile and mixed by shaking for 5 minutes. The samples are centrifuged at 6000 x g for 15 minutes at 4°C and 120 µL of supernatant removed into clean tubes. The samples are then evaporated to dryness and submitted for analysis by HPLC-MS/MS. Where desired, one or more control or reference compounds (5 µM) are tested simultaneously with the test compounds: one compound, propoxycaine, with low plasma stability and another compound, propantheline, with intermediate plasma stability. Samples are reconstituted in acetonitrile/methanol/water (1/1/2, v/v/v) and analyzed via (RP)HPLC-MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The HPLC conditions consist of a binary LC pump with autosampler, a mixed-mode, C12, 2 x 20 mm column, and a gradient program. Peak areas corresponding to the analytes are recorded by HPLC-MS/MS. The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 60 minutes relative to the amount remaining at time zero, expressed as percent, is reported as plasma stability. In case of half-life determination, the half-life is estimated from the slope of the initial linear range of the logarithmic curve of compound remaining (%) vs. time, assuming first order kinetics. Example 21: Chemical Stability The chemical stability of one or more subject compounds is determined according to standard procedures known in the art. The following details an exemplary procedure for ascertaining chemical stability of a subject compound. The default buffer used for the chemical stability assay is phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4; other suitable buffers can be used. A subject compound is added from a 100 µM stock solution to an aliquot of PBS (in duplicate) to give a final assay volume of 400 µL, containing 5 µM test compound and 1% DMSO (for half-life determination a total sample volume of 700 µL is prepared). Reactions are incubated, with shaking, for 0 minutes and 24 hours at 37°C; for half-life determination samples are incubated for 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours. Reactions are stopped by adding immediately 100 µL of the incubation mixture to 100 µL of acetonitrile and vortexing for 5 minutes. The samples are then stored at -20°C until analysis by HPLC-MS/MS. Where desired, a control compound or a reference compound such as chlorambucil (5 µM) is tested simultaneously with a subject compound of interest, as this compound is largely hydrolyzed over the course of 24 hours. Samples are analyzed via (RP)HPLC-MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The HPLC conditions consist of a binary LC pump with autosampler, a mixed-mode, C12, 2 x 20 mm column, and a gradient program. Peak areas corresponding to the analytes are recorded by HPLC-MS/MS. The ratio of the parent compound remaining after 24 hours relative to the amount remaining at time zero, expressed as percent, is reported as chemical stability. In case of half-life determination, the half-life is estimated from the slope of the initial linear range of the logarithmic curve of compound remaining (%) vs. time, assuming first order kinetics. Example 22: Akt Kinase Assay Cells comprising components of the Akt/mTOR pathway, including but not limited to L6 myoblasts, B-ALL cells, B-cells, T-cells, leukemia cells, bone marrow cells, p190 transduced cells, philladelphia chromosome positive cells (Ph+), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, are typically grown in cell growth media such as DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum and/or antibiotics, and grown to confluency. In order to compare the effect of one or more compounds disclosed herein on Akt activation, said cells are serum starved overnight and incubated with one or more compounds disclosed herein or about 0.1% DMSO for approximately 1 minute to about 1 hour prior to stimulation with insulin (e.g. 100 nM) for about 1 minutes to about 1 hour. Cells are lysed by scraping into ice cold lysis buffer containing detergents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate and protease inhibitors (e.g., PMSF). After contacting cells with lysis buffer, the solution is briefly sonicated, cleared by centrifugation, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose or PVDF and immunoblotted using antibodies to phospho- Akt S473, phospho- Akt T308, Akt, and β-actin (Cell Signaling Technologies). It is expected that one or more compounds of the present disclosure inhibit insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at S473. Alternatively, some compounds disclosed herein additionally inhibit insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at T308. Such class of compounds can inhibit Akt more effectively than rapamycin and may be indicative of mTORC2 inhibitors or inhibitors of upstream kinases such as PI3K or Akt. Example 23: Kinase Signaling in Blood PI3K/ Akt /mTor signaling is measured in blood cells using the phosflow method (Methods Enzymol. 2007;434:131-54). The advantage of this method is that it is by nature a single cell assay so that cellular heterogeneity can be detected rather than population averages. This allows concurrent dinstinction of signaling states in different populations defined by other markers. Phosflow is also highly quantitative. To test the effects of the inhibitors disclosed herein, unfractionated splenocytes, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated with anti-CD3 to initiate T-cell receptor signaling. The cells are then fixed and stained for surface markers and intracellular phosphoproteins. It is expected that inhibitors disclosed herein inhibit anti-CD3 mediated phosphorylation of Akt - S473 and S6, whereas rapamycin inhibits S6 phosphorylation and enhances Akt phosphorylation under the conditions tested. Similarly, aliquots of whole blood are incubated for 15 minutes with vehicle (e.g. 0.1 %DMSO) or kinase inhibitors at various concentrations, before addition of stimuli to crosslink the T cell receptor (TCR) (anti-CD3 with secondary antibody) or the B cell receptor (BCR) using anti-kappa light chain antibody (Fab'2 fragments). After approximately 5 and 15 minutes, samples are fixed (e.g. with cold 4% paraformaldehyde) and used for phosflow. Surface staining is used to distinguish T and B cells using antibodies directed to cell surface markers that are known to the art. The level of phosphrylation of kinase substrates such as Akt and S6 are then measured by incubating the fixed cells with labeled antibodies specific to the phosphorylated isoforms of these proteins. The population of cells are then analyzed by flow cytometery. The results are are expected to indicate one or more compounds disclosed herein that inhibit the phosphorylation of kinase substrates such as PI3K substrates, Akt substrates, mTORC1 substrates, mTORC2 substrates, mTOR substrates, MAPK substrates, ERK substrates, MAPKK substrates, and/or MEK substrates. Example 24: Colony Formation Assay Murine bone marrow cells freshly transformed with a p190 BCR-Abl retrovirus (herein referred to as p190 transduced cells) are plated in the presence of various drug combinations in M3630 methylcellulose media for about 7 days with recombinant human IL-7 in about 30% serum, and the number of colonies formed is counted by visual examination under a microscope. The results show that, compared to rapamycin, compounds of the present disclosure potentiate the effects of a half maximal concentration of known chemotherapeutic agents such as and without limitation imatinib, rapamycin, and dasatinib at the concentrations examined. Alternatively, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are obtained from philladelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) and negative (Ph-) patients upon initial diagnosis or relapse. Live cells are isolated and enriched for CD19+ CD34+ B cell progenitors. After overnight liquid culture, cells are plated in methocult GF+ H4435, Stem Cell Tehcnologies) suplemented with cytokines (IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, G-CSF, GM-CSF, CF, Flt3 ligand, and erythropoietin) and various concentrations of known chemotherapeutic agents in combination with either compounds of the present disclosure. Colonies are counted by microscopy 12-14 days later. Example 25: In Vivo Effect of Kinase Inhibitors on Leukemic Cells Female recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a γ source in two doses about 4 hr apart, with approximately 5Gy each. About 1hr after the second radiation dose, mice are injected i.v. with about 1x106 leukemic cells (e.g. Ph+ human or murine cells, or p190 transduced bone marrow cells). These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of about 5x106 normal bone marrow cells from 3-5 week old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs are harvested for analysis. Kinase inhibitor treatment begins about 10 days after leukemic cell injection and continues daily until the mice become sick or a maximum of approximately 35 days post-transplant. Inhibitors are given by oral lavage. Peripheral blood cells are collected approximately on day 10 (pre-treatment) and upon euthanization (post treatment), contacted with labled anti-hCD4 antibodies and counted by flow cytometry. It is expected that one or more compounds disclosed herein alone or in combination with known chemotherapeutic agents significantly reduce leukemic blood cell counts as compared to treatment with known chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. Gleevac) alone under the conditions tested. Example 26: Treatment of Lupus Disease Model Mice Mice lacking the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb that opposes PI3K signaling in B cells develop lupus with high penetrance. FcγRIIb knockout mice (R2KO, Jackson Labs) are considered a valid model of the human disease as some lupus patients show decreased expression or function of FcγRIIb (S. Bolland and J.V. Ravtech 2000. Immunity 12:277-285). The R2KO mice develop lupus-like disease with anti-nuclear antibodies, glomerulonephritis and proteinurea within about 4-6 months of age. For these experiments, the rapamycin analogue RAD001 (available from LC Laboratories) is used as a benchmark compound, and administered orally. This compound has been shown to ameliorate lupus symptoms in the B6.Sle1z.Sle3z model (T. Wu et al. J. Clin Invest. 117:2186-2196). Lupus disease model mice such as R2KO, BXSB or MLR/lpr are treated at about 2 months old, approximately for about two months. Mice are given doses of: vehicle, RAD001 at about 10mg/kg, or compounds disclosed herein at approximately 10mg/kg to about 50mg/kg. Blood and urine samples are obtained at approximately throughout the testing period, and tested for antinuclear antibodies (in dilutions of serum) or protein concentration (in urine). Serum is also tested for anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA antibodies by ELISA. Animals are euthanized at day 60 and tissues harvested for measuring spleen weight and kidney disease. Glomerulonephritis is assessed in kidney sections stained with H&E. Other animals are studied for about two months after cessation of treatment, using the same endpoints. It is expected that one or more compounds disclosed herein suppresses or delays the onset of lupus symptoms in lupus disease model mice. Example 35: Murine Bone Marrow Transplant Assay Female recipient mice are lethally irradiated from a γ ray source. About 1hr after the radiation dose, mice are injected with about 1x106 leukemic cells from early passage p190 transduced cultures (e.g. as described in Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2005 Aug;161(1):51-6). These cells are administered together with a radioprotective dose of approximately 5x106 normal bone marrow cells from 3-5wk old donor mice. Recipients are given antibiotics in the water and monitored daily. Mice who become sick after about 14 days are euthanized and lymphoid organs harvested for flow cytometry and/or magnetic enrichment. Treatment begins on approximately day 10 and continues daily until mice become sick, or after a maximum of about 35 days post-transplant. Drugs are given by oral gavage (p.o.). In a pilot experiment a dose of chemotherapeutic that is not curative but delays leukemia onset by about one week or less is identified; controls are vehicle-treated or treated with chemotherapeutic agent, previously shown to delay but not cure leukemogenesis in this model (e.g. imatinib at about 70mg/kg twice daily). For the first phase p190 cells that express eGFP are used, and postmortem analysis is limited to enumeration of the percentage of leukemic cells in bone marrow, spleen and lymph node (LN) by flow cytometry. In the second phase, p190 cells that express a tailless form of human CD4 are used and the postmortem analysis includes magnetic sorting of hCD4+ cells from spleen followed by immunoblot analysis of key signaling endpoints: p Akt -T308 and S473; pS6 and p4EBP-1. As controls for immunoblot detection, sorted cells are incubated in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitors of the present disclosure inhibitors before lysis. Optionally, "phosflow" is used to detect p Akt -S473 and pS6-S235/236 in hCD4-gated cells without prior sorting. These signaling studies are particularly useful if, for example, drug-treated mice have not developed clinical leukemia at the 35 day time point. Kaplan-Meier plots of survival are generated and statistical analysis done according to methods known in the art. Results from p190 cells are analyzed separated as well as cumulatively. Samples of peripheral blood (100-200µl) are obtained weekly from all mice, starting on day 10 immediately prior to commencing treatment. Plasma is used for measuring drug concentrations, and cells are analyzed for leukemia markers (eGFP or hCD4) and signaling biomarkers as described herein. It is expected that the results of the analysis demonstrate effective therapuetic doses of the compounds disclosed herein for inhibiting the proliferation of leukemic cells. It is further expected that combination therapy of the inhibitors disclosed herein with other chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. dasatinib) exhibit a greater degree of efficacy or decreased toxicity in comparison to the use of a single chemotherapeutic agent.
