1,9-Dimethyl-N-iso-propylphenothiazine (1,9-DMeiPrPT)
To an oven-dried 25 mL round-bottomed flask cooled under Na was added 1,9-dimethylphenothiazine (0.50 g, 2.2 mmol) and anhydrous DMF (5 mL). The solution was immersed in an ice-water bath, after which sodium hydride (0.116 g, 60 wt. % in mineral oil, 4.84 mmol) was added. After stirring the suspension for 5 min, 2-bromopropane (0.81 g, 6.59 mmol) was added into the reaction mixture. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and was stirred for 12 h. Ice was added to the reaction mixture, and the resulting precipitate was dissolved in diethyl ether. The organic layer was separated from the aqueous layer, washed with water and brine, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The crude material was purified by column chromatography over silica gel using hexanes as the eluent, then crystallized from aqueous ethanol, yielding the product as a white crystalline solid (0.25 g, 42%).
