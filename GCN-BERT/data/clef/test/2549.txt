Leukemia is a broad term covering a spectrum of diseases. In turn, it is part of the even broader group of diseases affecting the blood, bone .marrow, and lymphoid system, which arc ail known as hematological neoplasms. {00023 Clinically and pathologically , leukemia is subdivided into a variety of large groups. The first division is between its acute and chronic forms. Acute leukemia is a family of serious medical conditions relating to an original diagnosis of leukemia. Forms of acute leukemia include: acute myeloid leukemia, acute erythroid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-ceil acute lymphoblastic leukemia, adult T-eell leukemia/lymphoma, precursor Τ acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoina, blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Chronic leukemia is an increase of abnormal white blood cells. It differs from acute leukemia, and is categorized as myelogenous or lymphocytic. Chronic leukemia may refer to: chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia. Additionally, the diseases are subdivided according to which kind of blood cell is affected. This split divides leukemias into lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemias and myeloid or myelogenous leukemi as. {0063} In one aspect provided herein are methods for treating or reducing the risk of leukemia in a subject comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of a eyclohexenone compound having the structure; wherein each of X and Υ independently is oxygen, ,NR$ or sulfur, R is a hydrogen or C(=0)Cs-Csa!kyl; each of R(, R.2 a°d Rj independently is a hydrogen, optionally substituted methyl or SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION R.s is NRsR^ORs, 0C(O)R?J C(-O)0Rs, C(==0)R5, C(=0)NR5R6J halogen, 5 or 6-merobered lactone, C}-C§alkyl, C,-C8alkenyl, C,~C^aIkynyl, aryl, glucosyl, wherein the 5 or 6-membered lactone, C,-Cgalkyl, C,-C8alkenyl, C,-C8alkynyl, aryl, and glucosyl are optionally substituted with one or more substituents selected from NRjR,;, ORs, 0C(===0)R7, C(-0)0R.5, C(-0)Rs, C(===0)NR5R«,CrC8 alkyl, C,~Cg alkenyl, C,~CS alkynyi, C.,~CScycloalkyl, and Cj-Cg haloalkyl; each of R* and is independently a hydrogen or C,-Csa1kyl; R? is a C,-ChalkyI, ORjorNRsR*; m ::: 1-12; and η≈Μ2; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, metabolite, solvate or prodrug thereof.

A gray color with a dotted circle indicates molecules that have not been validated. Dashed edges indicate interactions that have not. been validated. “P” indicates phosphorylation, DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE IN VENTION {00131 Ras proteins are small GTPases that appear to be engaged in multiple signaling pathways, leading to complex and divergent effects. Activation of Ras proteins is regulated by posi-translational modification, which includes FTase-mediated pretty Union of Ras. Prenylation is essentia! for the norma! function and transforming activity of the Ras superfaraily of proteins. Thus, agents that block Ras prenylation have been developed to interfere with cancer cell, survival and proliferation. Exemplary Compound 1 described herein is a novel famesylated quinone derivative isolated fromAntrodia camphorata. Docking studies showed t hat the farnesyl isoprenoid tail of Compound 1 inserts into the central cavity of the FTase p-subunit similar to the farnesyl group of FPP (See FIG. 5). FTa.se inhibition assays revealed that Compound 1 inhibited FTase in a dose-dependent manner in vitro (See Example 10) Furthermore, the ratio of unprocessed to processed Ras increased after Compound I administration. (See FIG . 2). All. of these data support that exemplary Compound I, and the like interact with FTase to prevent Ras processing inside cancer cells, [0014] The IC50 values of Compound 1 in cancer cell lines described herein have been shown to correlate with expression of Ras and the epidermal, growth factor recep tor (EGFR). The data described herein suggests that the protein level of Ras and EGFR, rather than the presence of mutations in the Ras and EGFR genes, is the major determinant of Antroquinonol-induced cytotoxicity in cancer cells. J.00I5] The molecular modeling and docking-based approaches were used to demonstrate the possibility of interaction between GGTase-f and Compound 1. The previous studies revealed that Compound 1 triggers antitumor activity through several signaling molecules including ΑΜΡΚ, PI3K. and roTOR (see e.g., Kumar VB, et ah, Mutat Res 2011 Feb 10;707( 1-2):42-5229; Yu C-C, et a!., The journal of nutritional biochemistry 23 (8):900-907; Chiang P-C, et al., Biochemical Pharmacology 79 (2):162-171). Here, in some embodiments provide the exemplary cydohexertone compounds (e.g.. Compound 1) inhibiting Ras processing through inhibition of FTase activity. The possible signaling pathways that contribute to Compound 1-mediated antitumor activity are summarized in FIG. 7. The Ras-PI3K~Akt-mTOR pathway, which is associated with proliferation, motility, metabolism, and differentiation, is inhibited in response to Compound 1. Other key signaling molecules, such as ERKI/2 and ΑΜΡΚ, were induced in response to Compound 1 treatment. Several studies have found that ERKI/2 and ΑΜΡΚ are involved in different, aspects of apoptotic and autophagic cell death, it is inferred that multiple signaling pathways are simultaneously activated in response to Compound 1 stimulation. Thus, in some embodiments, the cydohexenone compounds provided herein (e.g., Compound 1) promote the anticancer effects by regulating cross talk in a complex signaling network that results in apoptosis and autophagy. (0016) Inhibition of prenyl transferase activity suppresses prenylation of multiple signaling molecules, interfering with downstream signaling. Ras is a pivotal signaling protein in a complex network that regulates several aspects of normal ceil growth and malignant transformation. Activating mutations in Ras, especially K-Ras, frequently occur in human cancers. Thus, targeting Ras is a promising strategy for treating cancer. Based on the biochemical characterization and molecular docking analysis, the cydohexenone compounds provided herein (e.g. . Compound 1) inhibit Ras processing via inhibition of the enzyme famesyltransferase, ultimately resulting in cell death. (0017j Leukemia is a malignant cancer of the bone marrow and blood. It is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of blood cells. Acute leukemia is a rapidly progressing disease that results in the massive accumulation of immature, fimeh.on.iess cells in the marrow and blood. The marrow often can no longer produce enough normal red and white blood cells and platelets. Anemia, a deficiency of red cells, develops in virtually all leukemia patients. The lack of normal white cells impairs the body’s ability to light' infections. A shortage of platelets results m bruising and easy bleeding. On. the other hand, chronic leukemia progresses more slowly and leads to unregulated proliferation and hence marked overexpansion of a spectrum of mature (differentiated) cells. |00l 8| hi some embodiments, provided herein are methods for treating or reducing the risk of a subject with leukemia by administering a cydohexenone compound described herein to the subject (e.g. a human).

Example ?: Determination of the cytotoxic effects of Compound 1 and its derivatives, analogues, and a metabolite [00113 j To determine whether the cytotoxic effects of Compound 1 correlate with the presence of Ras mutations, cell lines derived from human lung cancer (Α549 and Μ838), liver cancer (HepG2 and Η℮ρ3Β), and leukemia (Κ562 and THP-1) with wild-type Ras (Η838. Η℮ρ3Β, and Κ562) or mutant Ras (Α549, Η℮ρ02, and THP-I) were used. Cell viability was measured after 48 h of Compound 1 treatment. The cell lines and their ICjoS in increasing order were THP-1 (2.22 μΜ) < Α549 (3.24 μΜ) < Η838 (3.32 μΜ) < Η℮ρ3Β (3.74 μΜ) < Κ562 (5.12 μΜ) < HepG2 (6.42 μΜ) (Table 1). Thus, sensitivity to Compound 1 did not. correlate with Ras gene status, as Compound I exhibited excellent cytotoxic activity in all cell lines described herein.

Furthermore, based on the ICso values for Compound 1 analogs (Compounds 25 to 31) in Η838 cells indicated that the 2’-hydroxy group and the faroesyl group of Compound .1 were important for its cytotoxic effects. Example 8; Evaluation of the impact of Compound I on level of phosphoryiated ERK1/2 [00116] To evaluate the impact of Compound 1 on MAP kinase signaling, HepG2, Α549, and Η838 cells were treated with a wide range of Compound 1 concentrations, and immunoblots for phosphoryiated and total ERK 1/2 were performed. Compound f induced phosphorylation of ERK i/2 in HepG2 and Α549 cells, whereas the total ERK 1/2 expression level was unaffected (PIG. .1). However, in Η838 cells, the increase in ERK.1/2 phosphorylation after Compound 1 treatment was coincident with increased expression of total ERK 1/2. Thus, In general, Compound 1 induced an increase in ERK 1/2 phosphorylation in cancer cell lines. Example 9; Study of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation in Α549 cells bv Compound 1 [00117| In a previous report, Compound 1 was shown to inhibit ΡΒΚ signaling in .Α549 cells (Kumar VB, et a!., Mutat Res 2011 Feb 1ϋ;707(1-2):42-52). Here, it was shown that exemplary Compound 1 upregulates ERK I/2 phosphorylation in Α549 cells. Ras is an upstream regulator of Ρ13Κ and ERK1/2. To better understand the cellular signaling pathways that lead to Compound 1-mediated cancer cell death and to more precisely identify the cytosolic target of Compound 1, the contribution of Ras was investigated. Experiments were conducted in serum and serum-free conditions using Α549 and Μ838 cells, which were treated with different concentrations of Compound 1 for 24 h. Two distinct bands were detected on immunoblots probed for Ras. The slower migrating band corresponded to unprocessed Ras, whereas the faster migrating band represented fully processed Ras. Compound I caused an accumulation of unprocessed Ras in both cell lines in serum and serum-free conditions (FIG. 2Α). Furthermore, Compound 1 caused a dose-dependent accumulation of unprocessed Ras in Μ838, HepG2 and Κ562 cells (FIG. 2Β and 2C). The results show that Compound 1 inhibits Ras processing in cancer cells. Example 10: Evaluating the effects of Compound 1 on protein Fl'ase activity and ΡΡΡdependent Ras prenviation in cell culture [00118] Posttransiationai modification of Ras is essential for its activation. The first step committing Ras to become active is prenylation by the enzyme FTase. Comparison of the chemical structures of Compound 1 and FPP, which is a prenyl group donor for Ras, showed dial both compounds have the same CIS lipid chain (FSG. 3Α). Thus, the effects of Compound 1 on protein FTase activity and FFP-dependent Res prenylation in cell culture were evaluated. The results indicated that Compound 1 alone significantly enhanced accumulation of unprocessed Ras. Further, FPP alone potentiated Ras processing in Η838 cells. Competition assays showed that FPP neutralized the effect of Compound I on Ras processing at concentrations as low as 10 μΜ (FIG. SB), in addition, an in vitro enzymatic activity assay demonstrated that Compound 1 achieved dose-dependent inhibition of FTase activity (FIG. 3C). The results show that Compound 1 inhibits protein FTase activity and is competitive with FPP hi cell culture. Example 11 ; Molecular docking of Compound 1 on protein FTase {00119) The amino acid sequence for FTase (Accession no.: TJCQ A) was downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information protein database. A CDOCKER-A CHARMm-based molecular docking algorithm was applied to predict and assess the interaction between Compound 1 and the FTase CAAX box (see e.g, Wu G, et al, Vieth Μ (2003) Detailed analysis of grid-based molecular docking: A case study of CDOCKER-A CHARMm-based MD docking algorithm. Journal of Computational. Chemistry 24 (13): 1.549-1562). In order to limit bias, all user-adjustable parameters were kept at their default settings. (00129) To predict the putative interactions between FTase and exemplary cyclohexenone compounds described herein (e.g., Compound I), a molecular docking approach was conducted using the Dock Ligands (CDOCKEK) program. Using she crystal structure of FTase (PDB ID 1JCQ) as a template, we built a docking model to characterize the interaction between Compound 1 and the CAAX motif in FTase. Docking studies showed that Compound 1 and FPP bind in a similar orientation to the FTase active site (FIG. 4Α-Β). The famesyl group of Compound 1 lies in the hydrophobic cavity and interacts with a number of conserved aromatic residues. The ring structure with the functional groups of Compound 1 and the diphosphate moiety of FPP are located near the o/fl-subunu interface. The cytotoxic effects of the Compound 1 analogues indicate that the length of the isoprene unit and the 2’-hydroxy group play vital roles in mediating cytotoxic activity. 1001211 The docking model can also be used to explain differences in the cytotoxic profiles of Compound I analogues. It has been shown that the number of isoprene units influences the binding affinity of isoprenoids for FTase. The 2’~hydroxy group of Compound I may form intermolecuhir hydrogen bonds with the tyrosine residue, Y300b (FIG. 4C). In addition, the spatial arrangement of the ring structure of Compound I indicated that the 3-methoxy group is located in an unoccupied space near the interface of the FTase subunits. Thus, it is likely that demethoxy-Compound 1 would show an ICso only slightly less than the prototype, Compound 1. These results provide important structural insights into the specific architecture of Compound 1 and the CAAX motif in FTase (FIG. 4D), winch will help with the rational design of active cyclohexenone compounds described herein (e.g,, Compound 1 analogues). Example 12; Compound 1 enhanced autophagic activity in cancer cells 1001221 Our previous investigations indicated that Compound 1 induces apoptosis and/or autophagic cell death in human cancer ceil lines via the P13K/mTOR pathway. Ras lies upstream of Ρ13Κ and has been demonstrated to negatively regulate autophagic activity in RasVa! 12~transfonned NI.H3T3 cells. Here, the level of Compound i-induced autophagy in a lung cancer ceil line was measured by imniunoblot analysis of Bedim i and LC3B. LC3B-cont.aiiiing autophagosomes were visualized by confoca! microscopy. The results indicated that Beclin-l. expression increased at 24 h and 48 h after Compound 1 treatment (FIG, 5Α-Β), Compound 1 also induced autophagic conversion of LC3B-1 to LC3B-II. Further, LC3B-ll-associated autophagosomes (green fluorescent spots) were observed by confoca! microscopy (FIG. 5C). Statistical Analysis [00123] Results of the Examples were expressed as the mean± standard error of the mean (SEM) of three independent experiments, A single factor pair-wise ANGVA statistical analysis was conducted to determine the significance in differences. A two-tailed / -value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Example 13: Efficacy test of Compound 1 on leukemia cancer xenograft model [00124] Six to seven weeks old male CB.'i 7 SOD mice were purchased from BtoLasco Taiwan Co., LTD. and quarantined for one week.
