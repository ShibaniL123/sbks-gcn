Example 19. Preparation of N-(3-(4-(morpholine-4-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)-N-phenylpentaneamide (LMT-682)
Step 1: (4-bromophenyl)(morpholino)methanone
(4-bromophenyl)(morpholino)methanone was obtained (455 mg, yield 99%) by the same method as described in Step 2 of Example 1 using 4-bromobenzoic acid (340 mg, 1.70 mmol) and morpholine (0.18 ml, 2.04 mmol).
