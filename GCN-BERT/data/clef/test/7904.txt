Step 3: Preparation of (4-isobutoxyphenyl)methanamine hydrochloride (Compound XI×HCl)
To a solution of 4-isobutoxybenzaldehyde (Compound XIII) (19.9 g; 0.112 mol) in methanol (90 mL), Raney nickel (6 g) and 7N methanol ammonia solution (90 mL) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred under hydrogen atmosphere (0.5 bar) at 10-15° C. for 24 hours. The reaction solution was filtered through Celite to remove the catalyst. Methanol was distilled off and toluene (500 mL) was added. The solution was concentrated to 250 mL and 5-6 N HCl in 2-PrOH (30 mL; 0.15 mol) was added dropwise at ambient temperature. The resulting suspension was then cooled to 5° C. and stirred for additional 2 hours. Crystals were filtered off, washed with 60 mL of toluene, dried at 50° C./10 mbar for 10 hours yielding 20.88 g (86.7%) of (4-isobutoxyphenyl)methanamine hydrochloride (Compound XI×HCl). The product was analyzed by PXRD-form I was obtained, the PXRD pattern is shown in FIG. 3.
