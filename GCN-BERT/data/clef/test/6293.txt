Method of enhancing the latent hydraulic and/or pozzolanic reactivity of materials [0001] The present invention relates to a method of enhancing the latent hydraulic and/or pozzolanic reactivity of materials, especially waste and by-products to obtain useful supplementary cementitious materials that can be used as components in hydraulic binders. [0002] The cement industry is one of the industries with a high energy demand. Clinker production as well as grinding are processes with high power consumption. Furthermore, natural raw materials are nowadays recognized as valuable and finite resources that should be preserved as much as possible. Last but not least, the total amount of CO2 released by cement manufacturing accounts for 5 - 8 % from the total man-made CO2 emissions due to the huge amount of cement produced. Several approaches to reduce energy and raw material consumption as well as C02 emissions while covering the ever increasing demand for cement, concrete and other hydraulically setting building materials and products made therefrom are known. [0003] Energy and natural raw materials are saved by using supplementary cementitious materials (abbreviated SCM) for substituting parts of the clinker in cement. Latent hydraulic materials, specifically ground granulated blast furnace slag, as well as natural and artificial pozzolans are widely used. Their use leads to a decreased amount of clinker being required. Thus, they are able to reduce both the energy and the natural raw materials consumption required per unit of building material. They reduce C02 emissions considerably, since decarbonation of limestone for clinker production is one of the steps mainly contributing to that. The problem with composite binders comprising SCMs is a retardation of strength development compared with the binder from "pure" clinker. [0004] Further, the quality of materials used as SCM can vary significantly, especially as far as fly-ashes are concerned. For this reason, the amount of SCM in a composite binder is restricted. Lots of wastes and by-products are not suitable as SCM at all due to an insufficient pozzolanic or latent hydraulic reactivity, respectively. Thus, there is a need to optimize this approach both in respect of reactivity of the binders made with the cement as well as in the scope of materials used as SCM. [0005] It is also well known to use wastes and by-products instead of the natural raw materials for producing clinker. The saving of natural resources is the primary advantage of that approach. Besides, using e.g. waste concrete as raw material also reduces the energy demand, since decarbonation of limestone is one of the chemical processes contributing significantly to the high overall energy demand. However, in comparison to a use of the same materials as SCM, i.e. without a process of burning them to clinker, the energy required in a use as raw material is much higher, which is undesirable. [0006] A last proposal is the search for alternative materials showing the desired hydraulic reactivity for completely substituting classical cement like Portland cement or calcium aluminate cement. To this end cements with belite as main phase have been developed. Since they use much less or no limestone, they reduce CO2 emission. [0007] Specifically, it is generally known to provide belite based hydraulically reactive materials as alternative to Portland cement by hydrothermal treatment and calcining of materials containing Si02 and CaO and sometimes also Al203 and/or Fe203, see e.g. Η. Ishida et al., "alpha Dicalcium Silicate Hydrate: Preparation, Decomposed Phase, and its Hydration", J.Am.Chem.Soc. 76, ρ. 1707-1712, 1993; Jiang et al., "Hydrothermal Processing of New Fly-ash Cement", Ceramic Bulletin 71, ρ. 642-647, 1992; Pimraksa et al., "Synthesis of belite cement from lignite fly-ash", Ceram.

Sept. 2009, ρ. B-908 - Β-914; and Stevulova et al., "Influence of Hydrothermal Pre-Treatment of Coal Fly on the Synthesis of Belite Phase", J. of Environ. Science and Engineering 5, p.816-823, 2011. [0008] Most of these proposals use fly-ash predominantly combined with lime or hydrated lime to add enough CaO. The aim is always provision of a product useful as cement itself, mainly belite cement is obtained. The proposals mostly require a high temperature heating step, typically using at least 800 °C, for converting the hydrates produced by hydrothermal treatment into hydraulically reactive phases, i.e. a cement. Such new cements are not readily accepted in the building industry. Without any regulation by a standard or a specific official approval the building industry cannot apply a new product. Changing a standard is a time consuming and tedious process. Obtaining an official approval also requires time and incurs costs. In summary, depending on the method of making them, the alternative cements may still need valuable natural raw materials and/or a considerable amount of energy. Completely novel cements have the draw back of lacking standards and/or approvals to be widely used instead of Portland cement. [0009] It was now found that application of the steps hydrothermal treatment and preferably subsequent tempering at 350 to 600 °C, i.e. a temperature lower than deemed useful for providing belite cement according to the literature mentioned, surprisingly enables a significant activation of wastes and by-products. In this way, they can be used to make composite binders for which a standard, for example ΕΝ 197, is established. None of the prior proposals considers using the product obtained by hydrothermal treatment - with or without a subsequent heating step as supplementary cementitious material, i.e. mixing it with Portland cement (OPC) to obtain a composite binder or as component of established alternative binders like super sulphated cement. Instead they aimed at providing completely novel cements. [00010] The invention thus solves the above object by a method of enhancing the latent hydraulic and/or pozzolanic reactivity of materials, especially wastes and by-products, comprising the steps: - providing a starting material, preferably from one or more waste(s) and/or by-products), containing sources for CaO and at least one of SiC>2 and AI2O3 - mixing the starting material with water at a water/solids ratio from 0.1 to 100 and - hydrothermal treating of the starting material mixed with water in an autoclave at a temperature of 100 to 300 °C, a pressure of 0.5-5 MPa and a residence time from 0.1 to 50 hours to provide an autoclaved product. Preferably, the method further comprises the step of tempering the autoclaved product at a temperature from 350 to 600 °C, wherein the heating rate ranges from 10 to 6000 °C/minute and the residence time ranges from 0.01 to 600 minutes to provide an autoclaved and tempered product. Both, the autoclaved and the autoclaved and tempered product are useful as supplementary cementitious material and show enhanced reactivity compared to the starting material. In some instances herein both are summarized as SCM according to the invention or SCM obtained according to the invention. [00011] In the context of this invention "reactive" means a hydraulic, latent hydraulic or pozzolanic reactivity, unless indicated otherwise. A material has hydraulic reactivity when a paste made from the finely ground material by mixing it with water sets and hardens because of hydration reactions wherein the hardened product retains its’ soundness, strength and durability in air and under water. A material has latent hydraulic reactivity when it is able to undergo hydration reaction upon mixing with water, but needs an activation to harden hydraulically in a commercially acceptable period of time. A material has pozzolanic reacitivity, when upon mixing with water at normal temperatures it can only set and harden in the presence of an activator e.g. potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide (as cement pore solution is essentially made of). The OH" attacks the the silicon or the AI2O3 - Si02 network with following breaking of bonds between the oxygen and the networking-forming atoms. However, the distinction between latent hydraulic and pozzolanic is not always applied strictly, for the present invention the distinction is not important. [00012] Cement is used herein to designate a finely ground material that shows hydraulic reactivity. A cement can be used as such as a binder, typically a binder contains cement and further components like SCM and/or additives. A binder comprising a cement and one or more SCM(s) is designated composite binder. A binder can also be made of an SCM and an activator, in this instance the combination of the SCM and the activator is a cement. [00013] There are different criteria forjudging whether a material can be used as latent hydraulic or pozzolanic component in a cement or binder. Generally, it is only the glassy part of a material that shows reactivity, so a high crystallinity renders a material less useful or unusable. The chemical composition also underlies restrictions, e.g. organic components should not be contained. According to Ullmann, 7th Edition, WILEY VCH Verlag GmbH & Co KGaA, a slag has to have at least two thirds glass content and the ratio by mass (CaO + MgO)/SiC>2 shall exceed 1, a natural pozzolan shall have not less than 25 % reactive silica content. One quantitative criterium for usefulness is the strength activity index, which can be determined according to ASTM C 311 - 05. In the context of the present invention heat flow measurements are used as indicator for reactivity. Generally, a fast heat development and/or high cumulative heat release within short times indicates a high reactivity that correlates with fast strength development. [00014] The materials, especially wastes and by-products, that can be provided with enhanced reactivity according to the invention are numerous. Especially low quality by-products e.g crystalline and/or having low hydration activity indices can now be used. There are numerous materials that are less useful as SCM or even not usable as SCM at all in the form they occur. SCMs that are useful also benefit from an enhanced reactivity, they can be used in bigger amounts or the binder shows improved reactivity, for example. Typical examples for starting materials are high-calcium fly ash, low-calcium fly ash, incineration ash from combustion of municipal wastes both solid and liquid, bottom ash, slag, quartz, sand, gravel, used concrete, asbestos and mixtures of two or more of them. [00015] The starting materials ideally contain Si02 and CaO, and may contain Al203 and/or Fe203. Other compounds of these elements are likewise possible. The molar ratio of calcium (and magnesium if present) to the sum of silica, alumina, and iron oxide should preferably range from 1.0 to 3.5, more preferred from 1.5 to 2.5 and most preferred be about 2. If present, the ratio of the sum of aluminium and iron to silicon ranges from 0.01 to 100. For a high aluminium content a ratio of 100 to 10 is preferred, for a medium aluminium content from 1 to 20 and for a low aluminium content from 0.01 to 2. Compounds that are inert during the method are taken into account for calculation of the ratios. [00016] A raw material could have the desired composition on its own, if not, the desired ratios can be adjusted by adding further reaction partners before treatment begins. For increasing CaO content e.g., but not exclusively, portlandite, or burned limestone, ashes with high CaO content (either free lime or chemically bound Ca), as well as granulated blast furnace slag are suitable. [00017] As a rule the starting materials are optimized with regard to particle size and particle size distribution. To this end mechanical and thermal treatments are useful, wherein thermal treatments can also improve/optimize the (chemical) mineralogical composition. Examples for treatments are burning of carbon (e.g. in ashes) or conversion of non reactive phases to reactive compounds, like Si02 or C2AS into C2S, which in turn can improve conversion within the autoclave. In the case of asbestos a thermal pre-treatment is applied to change the hazardous particle form into non-hazardous forms. [00018] In a preferred embodiment a starting material is chosen or provided by pre-treatment that has a maximum grain size of 0.1 mm or below. For this especially the finer grain fractions from recycling cementitious binders in building materials such as used concrete and used cement are applied. A finer starting material is beneficial with regard to conversion rate as well as with regard to grinding effort for the SCM according to the invention. With a sufficiently fine starting material a grinding after the hydrothermal treatment (and tempering, if applicable) can be superfluous. An activating by intensive grinding is not necessary and does not take place. [00019] Preferably, further elements or oxides in an amount of 0.1 to 30 % by weight are added while mixing the starting materials or in a subsequent step. Sodium, potassium, boron, sulphur, phosphorous or a combination thereof are preferred as further elements/oxides, wherein further elements/oxides are together also designated foreign oxides. Useful are alkaline and/or earth alkaline salts and/or hydroxides, for example, but not exclusively, CaS04- 2H20, CaS04 ■ 1/2 H20, CaS04, CaHP02 ■ 2H20, Ca3P208, NaOH, ΚΟΗ, Na2C03, NaHC03, K2C03, MgC03, MgS04, Na2AI204, Na3P04, K3P04, Na2[B405(0H)4] ■ 8H20, CaCI2, Ca(N03)2, MgCI2, Mg(N03)2, AICI3, AI(N03)3, FeCI3, Fe(N03)3, Ca(CH3COO)2, Mg(CH3COO)2,AI(CH3COO)3, Ca(HCOO)2, Mg(HCOO)2, AI(HCOO)3, and mixtures of two or more of them. In a preferred embodiment the starting material mixture has a molar ratio P/Si of about 0.05 and/or S/Si of about 0.05 and/or Ca/K of about 0.05. [00020] The starting material mixture, optionally pre-treated as described, can optionally be mixed, i.e. seeded, with seed crystals, which e.g. contain calcium silicate hydrate, Portland clinker, granulated blast furnace slag, magnesium silicates, calcium sulphate aluminate (belite) cement, sodium silicate, glass powder and so on. Hereby, the reaction can be accelerated by seeding with from 0.01 to 30 % by weight seed crystals, especially differing calcium silicate and calcium silicate hydrate compounds, especially with a-2CaO ■ Si02 ■ H20, afwillite, calciochondroitite, α- and p-Ca2Si04 and other compounds. [00021] The produced starting material mixture, which is optionally seeded as described above, is subsequently subjected to a hydrothermal treatment in an autoclave at a temperature from 100 to 300 °C, preferably from 150 to 250 °C. Hereby, a water solids ratio from 0.1 to 100, preferably from 2 to 20 is chosen. The residence time is preferably 0.1 to 50 hours, preferred are 10 to 40 hours, most preferred 16 to 32 hours. [00022] Hydrothermal treatment converts the starting mixture into an autoclaved product containing calcium silicate hydrates or calcium aluminium hydrates, and optionally calcium aluminium silicate hydrate or magnesium silicate hydrate or calcium magnesium silicate hydrate or magnesium (aluminium, iron) silicate hydrate or magnesium (calcium, aluminium, iron) silicate and other compounds. [00023] The autoclaved product contains at least one, usually several of the mentioned calcium and/or magnesium silicate or aluminate hydrates, typically: - 0.01 to 80 % by weight a-C2SH, differing C-S-H forms including dellaite and partially carbonated C-S-H phases as well as amorphous and ill crystalline phases thereof -0.01 to 80 % by weight katoite, Si-katoite, Fe-katoite, also as mono- and semi carbonate as well as amorphous and ill crystalline phases thereof - 0.01 to 80 % by weight magnesium (calcium, aluminium, iron) silicates or silicate hydrates as well as amorphous and ill crystalline phases thereof - 0.01 to 80 % by weight aluminium and/or iron silicates and silicate hydrates as well as amorphous and ill crystalline phases thereof - traces and secondary components such as alumina, iron oxide (hematite, magnetite) and aluminium or iron hydroxides, C2AS, Ca(OH)2, MgC03, Mg(OH)2, quartz, cristobalite, anhydrite and calcite. [00024] Generally, the amorphous and ill crystalline phases are a precursor of the crystalline phases, for example calcium silicates (belite), calcium aluminates (mono calcium aluminates, mayenite), magnesium (aluminium, iron) silicates (serpentine, talc), and so on, which have no or only a low atomic (short-range) order. This is reflected in a lack of forming X-ray reflexes or the formation of very much broadened reflexes with low intensity. A good example for this is granulated blast furnace slag with high amorphous content (> 95 %). A very pronounced so called glassy hill ("Glasbuckel") over a 2θ range on which the main peak(s) of the crystalline phases, e.g. akermannite or gehlenite, are situated, depending on chemical composition. The degree of crystallinity depends from several parameters, like for example the kind of starting material, the temperature, the pressure and the built-in foreign ions. [00025] The autoclaved product is preferably subsequently tempered at a temperature from 350 to 600 °C. Heating rates are from 10 to 6000 °C/minute, preferably from 20 to 100 °C/minute and especially preferred about 40 °C/minute. Residence times from 0.01 to 600 minute, preferably from 1 to 120 minutes and especially preferred from 5 to 60 minutes are applied. No high intensity grinding takes place. [00026] The temperature for tempering is preferably 400 to 550 °C, especially preferred 400 to 495 °C. The higher the temperature during tempering, the lower is the preferred residence time. Tempering temperatures below 500 °C provide an especially reactive material, higher tempering temperatures are possible, however, and can make sense depending on the starting material. The tempering temperature and time should be chosen such that as much autoclaved material as possible is converted. On the other hand, the temperature should be as low as possible, since reactivity of the product is higher and this also restricts the necessary energy and thereby the cost and the environmental impact. [00027] After cooling, the product obtained comprises at least one calcium silicate or at least one calcium aluminate and at least one X-ray amorphous phase. Usually, the product comprises the following components: • 1 to 95 % by weight reactive calcium aluminates, preferably in the form of crystalline C12A7 or ill crystalline or amorphous aluminate phases • 1 to 80 % by weight magnesium (calcium, aluminium, iron) silicates, in the form of crystalline or ill crystalline or amorphous phases, that can contain foreign ions like Fe, Al, Ca • 1 to 80 % by weight C2S polymorphs, in the form of crystalline or ill crystalline or amorphous phases • 1 to 80 % by weight calcium aluminium silicates, in the form of crystalline or ill crystalline or amorphous phases • 1 to 80 % by weight calcium magnesium aluminium silicates, in the form of crystalline or ill crystalline or amorphous phases • up to 30 % by weight traces or minor components, especially C5A3, CA, calcium oxide, γ alumina and other aluminas, quartz, cristobalite and/or limestone, CaO, calcium sulphate, MgC03, Mg(OH)2, Fe2C>3, iron silicates such as Fe2Si04, amorphous iron containing phases and • 0 to 30 % by weight hydrates from the hydrothermal treatment, wherein all amounts of the product sum up to 100 % and the sum of calcium silicates, calcium aluminates, calcium aluminium silicates, magnesium silicates and calcium magnesium silicates is at least 30 % by weight, preferably at least 50 % by weight and most preferred at least 70 % by weight. [00028] Provided that the fineness of the autoclaved or autoclaved and tempered product is already sufficient (use of fine raw materials with suitable particle size distribution), this product is already the desired activated SCM. If the fineness is insufficient or a binder with exceptionally high fineness is desired, the product can be ground in a manner known per se, with or without additions, to the desired fineness or particle size distribution, respectively. A suitable fineness is e.g. from 2000 to 10.000 cm2/g (Blaine). [00029] The product is especially useful as SCM for composite binders. It can also be used for other cements/binders containing latent hydraulic and/or pozzolanic materials, like supersulphated cement, geopolymer binders. [00030] A composite binder contains the SCM according to the invention and one or more ground clinker(s), preferably Portland cement or Portland cement clinker. It can further contain fly-ash or ground granulated blastfurnace slag according to the prior art (i.e. not activated according to the invention), metakaolin and/or limestone. The components can be mixed in finely ground form or mixed and then ground together. The amount of the one or more SCMs preferably ranges from 1 to 99 % by weight, more preferred from 5 to 70 % by weight, and most preferred from 10 to 30 % by weight. The amount of Portland cement and/or Portland cement clinker preferably ranges from 1 to 99 % by weight, more preferred from 30 to 95 % by weight, and most preferred from 70 to 90 % by weight. Both relate to the sum of SCM(s) and Portland cement (clinker). [00031] A super sulphated cement contains the SCM, sulphate and an alkaline compound, typically OPC. Generally it contains about 80 % by weight SCM, 15 % by weight sulfate and 5 % by weight OPC. [00032] The BET surface of the SCM according to the invention and/or of the binder should range from 1 to 30 m2/g. The water content of the SCM according to the invention is typically 20 % by weight or less, preferably less than 15 % by weight and especially preferred less than 10 % by weight. [00033] The binder can be used in combination with all admixtures such as waterreducers and set controlling admixtures e.g. polycarboxylate ether-based superplasticizers, corrosion-inhibiting admixtures, shrinkage-reducing admixtures, air-entraining admixtures etc. in the usual amounts. Also additives like fibres, stone dust and so on can be comprised. [00034] The binder can be used for concrete making, for pre-cast units, such as panels, beams, road furniture, or cast-in situ concrete such as building superstructures, roads, dams. The binder can also be used in mortars, for plasters and screeds, and in grouts (consolidate foundations, road-beds, etc.). [00035] The method according to the invention provides SCMs with high amounts of hydraulically reactive phases like C2S, Ci2A7, magnesium silicates and amorphous phases. They are characterized by comprising highly reactive polymorphs of C2S, highly reactive magnesium (calcium, aluminium, iron) silicates, Ci2A7 and X-ray amorphous as well as ill crystalline phases. [00036] In contrast to the prior methods of hydrothermal treatment of raw materials containing aluminium the temperature during tempering is restricted to below 600 °C, preferably to below 550 °C and especially preferred to below 500 °C, so that very reactive polymorphs of C2S, Mg containing phases, Ci2A7 and others are obtained as well as X-ray amorphous phases. Thereby a high reactivity and an exceptionally fast hydration and strength development based on the formed calcium and magnesium silicate hydrates and calcium aluminate hydrates is achieved. [00037] The invention will be illustrated further with reference to the examples that follow, without restricting the scope to the specific embodiments described. If not otherwise specified any amount in % or parts is by weight and in the case of doubt referring to the total weight of the composition/mixture concerned. [00038] The invention further includes all combinations of described and especially of preferred features that do not exclude each other. A characterization as "approximately", "around" and similar expression in relation to a numerical value means that up to 10 % higher and lower values are included, preferably up to 5 % higher and lower values, and in any case at least up to 1 % higher and lower values, the exact value being the most preferred value or limit. [00039] Example 1 10 g of slag were added to water (water-to-solid (w/s) of 10) and hydrothermally treated at 185 °C and 1.1 MPa for 16 h once or twice in a stainless steel autoclave. 2 % NaOH (solid/solid) was added to the solution before each autoclaving step to promote the dissolution of the glassy phases. The products obtained after 16 h and after 32 h autoclaving were tempered for 1 h directly at 500 °C. [00040] The chemical composition including the loss on ignition at 1050 °C (LOI) of the used slag designated "G" is given in table 1. This slag is unsuitable as SCM due to its high content of crystalline phases.

The measured heat flow and the cumulated heat flow are shown in figures 1a and 1b. [00043] The heat evolution curves indicate a significant accelerating effect for blends of OPC and hydrothermally treated material compared to blends of OPC with untreated material. Mixes of OPC with hydrothermally treated slag show a maximum rate of the heat release shifted to the left and a faster onset of the acceleration period. Subsequent tempering further increases the reactivity of the hydrothermally treated product and results in greater maximal values for the main heat peak release. In terms of cumulative heat release, after 8 h the heat output for the blends of OPC with hydrothermally treated and tempered slag are three fold higher compared to blends of OPC with untreated slag. The values remain greater after 7 days. This clearly shows the benefit that hydrothermal treatment and hydrothermal treatment followed by tempering has on the poorly reactive slags. [00044] Example 2 10 g of slag were added to water (water-to-solid (w/s) of 10) and hydrothermally treated at 185 °C for 16 h and 1.1 MPa in a stainless steel autoclave. 2 % NaOH (solid/solid) was added to the solution before the autoclaving step to promote the dissolution of the glassy phases. The autoclaved product obtained was tempered for 1 h directly at 500 °C.

The results were compared to the heat flow recorded for mixes of 70 % OPC and 30 % non-treated slag and 70 % OPC and 30 % quartz. The measured heat flow and cumulative heat flow are shown in figures 2a and 2b. [00048] The heat evolution curves indicate a significant accelerating effect for blends of OPC with treated material compared to blends of OPC with untreated material. Mixes of OPC with hydrothermally treated and tempered slags show a maximum rate of the heat release shifted to the left and a faster onset of the acceleration period. The maximum rate of the heat release shifts to the left with extended duration of the hydrothermal step. [00049] In terms of cumulative heat release, after 8 h the heat output for the blends of OPC with hydrothermally treated and tempered slags are two and three fold higher (three fold higher when the autoclaving step is repeated) compared to blends of OPC with untreated slag. After 16 h autoclaving the heat release values for modified systems are higher by 38 % and 75 % respectively for mixes of OPC and hydrothermally treated slag with subsequent tempering. The values remain greater after 7 days. This clearly shows the benefit that hydrothermal treatment and hydrothermal treatment followed by tempering has on the poorly reactive slags. [00050] Example 3 10 g of slag were added to water (water-to-solid (w/s) of 10) and hydrothermally treated at 185 °C for 16 h and 1.1 MPa in a stainless steel autoclave. 2 % water glass (№2Ο ■ Si02) (solid/solid) was added to the solution before the autoclaving step to promote the dissolution of the glassy phases. The autoclaved product obtained was tempered for 1 h directly at 500 °C. [00051] The chemical composition including the loss on ignition at 1050 °C (LOI) of the used slag designated "E" is given in table 3. This slag is a fairly reactive material, but lacks ideal reactivity.
