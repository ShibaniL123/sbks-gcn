INHIBITORS OF ADAPTER ASSOCIATED KINASE 1, COMPOSITIONS COM PRISING THEM, AND METHODS OF THEIR USE 1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to pyrazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidine-based compounds useful as inhibitors of adaptor associated kinase 1 (AAKl), compositions comprising them, and methods of their use. 2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Adaptor associated kinase 1 (AAKl) is a member of the Arkl/Prkl family of serine/threonine kinases. AAKl mRNA exists in two splice forms termed short and long. The long form predominates and is highly expressed in brain and heart (Henderson and Conner, Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007, 18, 2698- 2706). AAKl is enriched in synaptosomal preparations and is co-localized with endocytic structures in cultured cells. AAKl modulates clatherin coated endocytosis, a process that is important in synaptic vesicle recycling and receptor-mediated endocytosis. AAKl associates with the AP2 complex, a hetero-tetramer which links receptor cargo to the clatherin coat. The binding of clatherin to AAKl stimulates AAKl kinase activity (Conner et. al., Traffic 2003, 4, 885-890; Jackson et. al., ! Cell. Biol. 2003, 163, 231-236). AAKl phosphorylates the mu-2 subunit of AP-2, which promotes the binding of mu-2 to tyrosine containing sorting motifs on cargo receptors (Ricotta et. al., J. Cell Bio. 2002, 156, 791-795; Conner and Schmid. J. Cell Bio. 2002. 156, 921-929). Mu2 phosphorylation is not required for receptor uptake, but phosphorylation enhances the efficiency of internalization (Motely et. al., Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006, 17, 5298-5308). AAKl has been identified as an inhibitor of Neuregulin-l/ErbB4 signaling in PC12 cells. Loss of AAKl expression through RNA interference mediated gene silencing or treatment with the kinase inhibitor K252a (which inhibits AAKl kinase activity) results in the potentiation of Neuregulin-1 induced neurite outgrowth. These treatments result in increased expression of ErbB4 and accumulation of ErbB4 in or near the plasma membrane (Kuai et. al., Chemistry and Biology 2011. 18, 891-906). NRG1 and ErbB4 are putative schizophrenia susceptibility genes (Buonanno, Brain Res. Bull. 2010, 83, 122-131). SNPs in both genes have been associated with multiple schizophrenia endophenotypes (Greenwood et. al., Am. J. Psychiatry 2011, 168, 930-946). Neuregulin l and ErbB4 KO mouse models have shown schizophrenia relevant morphological changes and behavioral phenotypes (Jaaro-Peled et. al., Schizophrenia Bulletin 2010, 36, 301-313; Wen et. al.. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010. 107. 1211-1216). In addition, a single nucleotide polymorphism in an intron of the AAKl gene has been associated with the age of onset of Parkinson's disease (Latourelle et. al., BMC Med. Genet. 2009, 10, 98). These results suggest that inhibition of AAKl activity may have utility in the treatment of schizophrenia, cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease. 3.

PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS Pharmaceutical formulations may be adapted for administration by any appropriate route, for example by the oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual, or transdermal), vaginal, or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional, intravenous, or intradermal injections or infusions) route. Such formulations may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example by bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier(s) or excipient(s). Oral administration or administration by injection are preferred. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or nonaqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; or oil-in-water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil emulsions. For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Powders are prepared by comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing with a similarly comminuted pharmaceutical carrier such as an edible carbohydrate, as, for example, starch or mannitol. Flavoring, preservative, dispersing, and coloring agent can also be present. Capsules are made by preparing a powder mixture, as described above, and filling formed gelatin sheaths. Glidants and lubricants such as colloidal silica, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, or solid polyethylene glycol can be added to the powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrating or solubilizing agent such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, or sodium carbonate can also be added to improve the availability of the medicament when the capsule is ingested. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, betonite, xanthan gum, and the like. Tablets are formulated, for example, by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and disintegrant, and pressing into tablets. A powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound, suitable comminuted, with a diluent or base as described above, and optionally, with a binder such as carboxymethylcellulose, an aliginate, gelating, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a solution retardant such as paraffin, a resorption accelerator such as a quaternary salt and/or and absorption agent such as betonite, kaolin, or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage, or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials and forcing through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be run through the tablet machine and the result is imperfectly formed slugs broken into granules. The granules can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc, or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The compounds of the present disclosure can also be combined with a free flowing inert carrier and compressed into tablets directly without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A clear or opaque protective coating consisting of a sealing coat of shellac, a coating of sugar or polymeric material, and a polish coating of wax can be provided. Dyestuffs can be added to these coatings to distinguish different unit dosages. Oral fluids such as solution, syrups, and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit form so that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of the compound. Syrups can be prepared by dissolving the compound in a suitably flavored aqueous solution, while elixirs are prepared through the use of a non-toxic vehicle. Solubilizers and emulsifiers such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxyethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavor additive such as peppermint oil or natural sweeteners, or saccharin or other artificial sweeteners, and the like can also be added. Where appropriate, dosage unit formulations for oral administration can be microencapsulated. The formulation can also be prepared to prolong or sustain the release as for example by coating or embedding particulate material in polymers, wax, or the like. Compounds of the invention may be administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phopholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, or phophatidylcholines. Compounds of the invention may also be delivered by the use of monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules are coupled. The compounds may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidephenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted with pantoyl residues. Furthermore, the compounds may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates, and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches intended to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. For example, the active ingredient may be delivered from the patch by iontophoresis as generally described in Pharmaceutical Research 1986, 3(6), 318. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration may be formulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols, or oils. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for rectal administration may be presented as suppositories or as enemas. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for nasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a course powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns which is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e., by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable formulations wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as a nasal spray or nasal drops, include aqueous or oil solutions of the active ingredient. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for administration by inhalation include fine particle dusts or mists, which may be generated by means of various types of metered, dose pressurized aerosols, nebulizers, or insufflators. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulations. Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and soutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents. 5.5. EXAMPLES 5.5.1. AAK1 Knockout Mice Mice homozygous (-/-) for the disruption of the AAK1 gene were prepared by two methods; gene trapping and homologous recombination. Gene trapping is a method of random insertional mutagenesis that uses a fragment of DNA coding for a reporter or selectable marker gene as a mutagen. Gene trap vectors have been designed to integrate into introns or genes in a manner that allows the cellular splicing machinery to splice vector encoded exons to cellular mRNAs. Commonly, gene trap vectors contain selectable marker sequences that are preceded by strong splice acceptor sequences and are not preceded by a promoter. Thus, when such vectors integrate into a gene, the cellular splicing machinery splices exons from the trapped gene onto the 5' end of the selectable marker sequence. Typically, such selectable marker genes can only be expressed if the vector encoding the gene has integrated into an intron. The resulting gene trap events are subsequently identified by selecting for cells that can survive selective culture. Embryonic stem cells (Lex-1 cells from derived murine strain A129), were mutated by a process involving the insertion of at least a portion of a genetically engineered vector sequence into the gene of interest, the mutated embryonic stem cells were microinjected into blastocysts which were subsequently introduced into pseudopregnant female hosts and carried to term using established methods. See, e.g., "Mouse Mutagenesis", 1998, Zambrowicz et al., eds., Lexicon Press, The Woodlands, TX. The resulting chimeric animals were subsequently bred to produce offspring capable of germline transmission of an allele containing the engineered mutation in the gene of interest. AAKl-gene disrupted mice were also made by homologous recombination. In this case, the second coding exon of the murine AAKl gene (see GenBank Accession Number NM_177762) was removed by methods known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,487,992, 5,627,059, and 5,789,215. Mice homozygous (-/-) for the disruption of the AAKl gene were studied in conjunction with mice heterozygous (+/-) f°r the disruption of the AAKl gene, and wild-type (+/+) litter mates. During this analysis, the mice were subject to a medical work-up using an integrated suite of medical diagnostic procedures designed to assess the function of the major organ systems in a mammalian subject. Homozygous (-/-) "knockout" mice were studied in conjunction with their heterozygous (+/-) and wild-type (+/+) litter mates. Disruption of the AAKl gene was confirmed by Southern analysis. Expression of the murine homolog of AAKl was detected by RT-PCR in murine brain; spinal cord; eye; thymus; spleen; lung; kidney; liver; skeletal muscle; bone; stomach, small intestine and colon; heart; adipose; asthmatic lung; LPS liver; blood; banded heart; aortic tree; prostate; and mammary gland (5 week virgin, mature virgin, 12 DPC, 3 day post-partum (lactating), 3 day post-weaning (early involution), and 7 day post-weaning (late involution)). AAKl homozygous (-/-) and their wild-type (+/+) Nttermates were tested using the formalin paw test described below in Example 5.5.6 in order to assess their acute and tonic nociceptive responses. As shown in Figure 1, phase 1 and phase 2 data were obtained using homozygous (-/-) mice females (n = 16), wild-type females (n = 15), homozygous (-/-) mice males (n = 9), and wild-type males (n = 18). In all groups and in both phases, the AAKl homozygous (-/-) mice exhibited significantly less recorded paw flinching than their wild-type (+/+) Nttermates.

P81 Filter Plate Assay Compounds were serially diluted into a Labcyte LDV plate (Labcyte, cat# LP-0200) using a Mutiprobe (PerkinElmer) and Biomek FX (Beckman Coulter) so that the highest compound concentration was at 96 μΜ. Compounds were then pinged (75 nl_ per well) into a Greiner 384-well reaction plate (Greiner, # 781076) using an ECHO 550 Liquid Handler (Labcyte). A total of 12μΙ reaction buffer (IMAP buffer containing Tween and DTT, from Molecular Devices) was then added to each well of columns 1 and 13 for the negative controls and 12μΙ of 2X AAK1 (0.2 nM full-length human protein, NCBI accession no. NP_055726.2) was added to the remaining wells. Enzyme was then pre-incubated with compound for 10 minutes at RT. Reactions were initiated upon Minitrak (PerkinElmer) addition of 12μΙ substrate mix containing 2X Mu2 (0.2 μΜ, full length human protein), 2x cold ATP (2 μΜ), and 1.3 μθϊ of hot 33P-ATP. Reactions proceeded for one hour at RT. Meanwhile, Millipore 384-well P81 filter plates (Millipore, catalog # MZPHNOWIO) were placed on a plate washer (Zoom ZW, from Titertek) and pre-wet with 50μΙ 1% phosphoric acid. Kinase reactions were then stopped upon addition of 24μΙ of 2% phosphoric acid to each well and the Minitrak was then used to transfer 40μΙ from each well into the pre-wet Millipore 384-well P81 filter plates. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 minutes at RT in the P81 plates, followed by washing five times with ΙΟΟμΙ/well of 1% phosphoric acid using the Zoom filter washer. The bottom of each filter plate was sealed followed by addition of 20μΙ Microscint 40 to each well, sealing the top of the plates with Flashplate cover, and then waiting one hour until reading on the TopCount (PerkinElmer). 5.5.4. HEK281 Cell-Based Assay HEK293F cells were cultured in media containing DMEM (Gibco, cat. #11965), 10% FBS (SAFC Biosciences, cat. #12103C), IX GPS (glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin). On day one, cells were plated on a 10cm dish so that they are -80% confluent at time of transfection. Roughly 12 million cells were in a 10cm dish at time of transfection. On day two, each dish was transfected with 48 ug DNA and 144 ul Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, cat.# 11668-019). The DNA was comprised of a mixture (per 10cm dish) containing 3 ug AAKl/HA/plRES (full length human, NCBI accession no. NP_055726.2), 45 μg Flag/AP2MI/pcDNA (full length human), and 1.5 ml OPTI-MEM. The Lipofectamine 2000 is made up of a mixture (per 10cm dish) containing 144 μΙ Lipofectamine 2000 and 1.5 ml OPTI-MEM. Each mixture was transferred to individual 15ml tubes and incubated at RT for 5 minutes, and then the two mixes were combined and incubated at RT for 20 minutes. Growth media was then aspirated from each 10cm plate and replaced with 10ml of DMEM+10% FBS (no GPS). Finally, 3 ml DNA/Lipofectamine mix was added to each 10cm dish and mix gently followed by incubate of plate overnight at 37 ° C and 5% CO2. On day three, compounds were diluted in 100% DMSO at 1000X final concentration, followed by 3-fold serial dilutions for a total of 5 concentrations tested. Four compounds were tested per 10cm dish. One ul of each compound dilution was then pipetted into a deep-well, 96-well plate, followed by addition of 500 μΙ DMEM + 0.5% FBS into each well for a 2X final concentration of each compound. Cells were resuspended in a 10cm dish by simple pipetting (HEK293 cells come off the plate that easy at this point) and then transferred to a 50 ml conical tube and pelleted by centrifugation at lOOOrpm for 5 min. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 2.75 ml DMEM + 0.5% FBS per 10cm dish and 100 μΙ of cell suspension transferred into each well of 96-well TC plate. Finally, 100 μΙ of 2X compound diluted in DMEM + 0.5% FBS was then added into wells containing cell suspension for a IX final concentration. Plates were then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 hours followed by transferring of cell suspensions from each well into 12-tube PCR strips. The PCR strips were spun in a tip rack at lOOOrpm for 5 minutes to pellet cells and media was then removed by pipetting without disturbing the cell pellet. To prepare for Western Blot analysis, cell pellets were resuspend in 40ul IX LDS-PAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen, cat.# NP0008) + 2X Halt phophatase and protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific, cat.#1861284), followed by sonicating each with microtip sonicator set at 5 for 8- 10 seconds. Five ul of 10X NuPage Sample Reducing Agent (with 50 mM DTT) was to each sample followed by heat denaturing at 70C for 10 min on PCR machine. A total of ΙΟμΙ per sample was loaded into each lane of a 4-20% Tris-Glycine Criterion 26-well gel (Biorad, cat.# 345-0034) for the phospho-mu2 blot and ΙΟμΙ per lane in a 4-12% Bis-Tris (+MES buffer) NuPAGE 26-well gel (Invitrogen, cat.# WG1403BX10) for the mu2 blot. For controls, 2ng of phospho-mu2 or 20ng mu2/Flag proteins were loaded in the last well of each gel. After SDS-PAGE, samples on each gel were transferred to PVDF membrane using an i Blot and membranes were blocked for one hour in TBST + 5% milk, followed by wash 3X for 5-10 min with TBST. Criterion gels were probed with rabbit anti-phospho-mu2 (1:5000; a rabbit polyclonal antibody produced by New England Peptide and affinity purified at Lexicon) in TBST + 5% BSA, whereas, NuPAGE gels were probed with mouse anti- Flag (1:500; Sigma, cat.# F1804) in TBST + 5% milk, and these primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C on a rocker. On day four, Western blots were washed 3X for 5-10 minutes with TBST, probe with anti- rabbit-HRP (1:2000; BioRad, cat.# 170-6515) or anti-mouse-HRP (1:2000; Biorad, cat.# 170-6516) in TBST + 5% milk for 1 hour at RT, washed 3X for 10 minutes with TBST, and developed with ECL reagent (GE Healthcare, cat.# RPN2132) on a Versadoc. Finally, the camera was set up to take a picture every 30 seconds for 10 minutes and the best image saved for each blot with no saturated signal (when the signal is saturated, the bands will be highlighted red). A volume analysis on each band was performed to obtain density values. Percent inhibition was calculated for each sample by first normalizing to total Mu2 expression levels and then comparing to 0% and 100% controls. IC50 values were then calculated using Excel fitting software. 5.5.5. In Vitro Data In vitro data were obtained for 3-methyloxetan-3-yl-4-(3-(2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)pyrazolo[l,5- a]pyrimidin-5-yl)piperazine-l-carboxylate using the methods described above. In the P81 assay, the compound measured 0.9 nM. In the HEK281 cell-based assay, the compound measured 4.7 nM. 5.5.6. Formalin Assay Mice were tested for nociception with Automatic Nociception Analyzers (purchased from the Ozaki lab at University of California, San Diego). A metal band was placed around the left hind paw of each mouse with superglue 30 minutes prior to testing. After the 30-minute acclimation period, 20 μΙ of 5% formalin was subcutaneously injected in the dorsal surface of the left hind paw. Mice were individually housed in cylindrical chambers for 45 minutes. Fresh 5 % formalin solution was prepared by diluting formaldehyde (Formalde-fresh 20%, Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) with distilled water. Investigatory compounds were administered 30 minutes prior to formalin injection. A computer software recorded flinches per minute, total flinches for Phase I (acute phase = first 8 minutes), and total flinches for Phase II (tonic phase between 20 - 40 minutes) through an electromagnetic field.

Mouse Chung Assay The compound 3-methyloxetan-3-yl-4-(3-(2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)pyrazolo[l,5-a]pyrimidin-5- yl)piperazine-l-carboxylate was studied in the Chung assay. See Chaplan SR, Bach FW, Pogrel JW, Chung JM, Yaksh TL., Quantitative assessment of tactile allodynia in the rat paw, J Neurosci Methods 1994;53:55-63; Chung JM, Kim HK, Chung K., Segmental spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain. Methods Mol Med. 2004:99:35-45. Wild-type hybrid (C57BL/6J-Tyrc Brd χ 129S5/SvEvBrd) male mice were between 5-7 weeks of age at the time of spinal nerve ligation by the conventional Chung protocol. Spinal nerve ligation was carried out according to the procedure devised by Kim and Chung with modifications. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2% at the oxygen flow rate of lml/min). A skin incision (1 cm) was made 1mm to the left of the dorsal midline, using the level of iliac crests as the mid point of the incision. The paraspinal muscles were bluntly separated medial to the iliac crest to reveal transverse processes between the caudal edge of L4 and the rostral edge of L6 (or sacroiliac junction in mice that had only five LV). This approach facilitated identification of spinal nerves L4, L5, and/or L6. In an initial experiment using hybrid mice, the presumptive locations of spinal nerve L5 and L6 were determined by using the sacroiliac junction as the landmark to locate L6, as previously described in SNL models in rats and mice. In compound test experiments using C57 mice, the position of the last two lumbar transverse processes in relation to the iliac crest was used to differentiate mice with five LV from those with six. Using these bone landmarks, the number of LV a mouse possess were accurately identified in majority of cases. L4 and L5 spinal nerve identification was made not only according to their relevant position to transverse processes but also by the gross observation of the nerves: L3 and L4 spinal nerves exclusivelyjoined each other in the surgical field while L5 stayed alone. The left L4 and/or L5 spinal nerves were isolated and tightly ligated with 7-0 silk suture. To ligate L4, L4 was separated from L3, and a glass hook was used to pull the suture out under L4. Ligation of L5 was performed by passing suture under L5 with one pair of fine forceps and pulling the suture out from the other side with another pair of fine forceps. In very rare cases when L3 and L4 merged under L5 transverse process, L4 ligation can be made at the proximal level to the rostral edge of L5 transverse process. There was therefore no need to excise the transverse process. In sham-operated animals, the surgical procedure was identical to that as described above, except that spinal nerves were not ligated. In the spinal nerve transections performed on a fourth cohort of mice, L4 or L5 spinal nerves were cut across using fine microsurgical scissors at the same level where ligatures would normally be placed. After hemostasis was confirmed, the incision was closed in two layers, with 5-0 vicryl suture for the dorsolumbar fascia and wound clips for the skin. Mice were given an injection of saline (1 ml) and buprenorphine (0.05-0.1 mg kg mice) immediately following the surgery and buprenorphine again at approximately 12 and 24 hours post-surgery (for a total of 3 doses) to relieve surgery-induced pain. A warming pad and a heating lamp were used to maintain normal body temperature in the animal throughout the surgery. Mice were individually housed after the procedure and were monitored until complete recovery from anesthesia. Von Frey tactile allodynia was assessed by testing the hindpaw withdrawal response (withdrawal, flinching, licking) to a set of von Frey filaments (numbered 2.44, 2.83, 3.22, 3.61, 4.08, and 4.31 corresponding approximately to force of 0.04, 0.07, 0.16, 0.4, 1, and 2 gm, Stoelting Co. Wood Dale, IL) in an up-down procedure as described by Chaplan et al. Baseline von Frey tests were carried out prior to surgery, and repeated once a week for 3 to 6 weeks after surgery depending on experimental design. For the von Frey tests, mice were placed in transparent polyethylene terephthalate cylinders (10" height/ 4.25" diameter) with a ¼" wire mesh floor to allow the experimenter to apply the von Frey filament to the mouse plantar surface. Both paws were tested. The first von Frey filament applied was 3.61. If no response was elicited, the next stronger filament was presented. If there was a response the next weaker filament was presented. There were a total of six presentations of von Frey filaments (if the ani mal did not respond to the strongest filament, 4.31, the test was ended). The 50% withdraw threshold was calculated for each paw using the up down method. Mice that exhibited 50% withdraw threshold below 2 in any paw during baseline testing were excluded from surgery and further assessment. Von Frey test experimenters were always blind to the nature of the surgery and the treatment. In order to reduce exploratory locomotor activity, mice were habituated to the testing chambers for 60 minutes the day before pre-surgery baseline testing and for 30 minutes in the chambers prior to von Frey test in which a compound was given. White noise was on in the testing room throughout the experi ment. As shown in Figure 6, compound 3-methyloxetan-3-yl-4-(3-(2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)pyrazolo[l,5- a]pyri midin-5-yl)piperazine-l-carboxylate exhibited a dose-dependent, significantly significant effect in the Chung assay.
