Œê TITLE Fast Cup and Glass Warmer SPECIFICATION DESCRIPTION [0001] The present invention relates generally to warming drinking cups and glasses prior to pouring hot beverages into them. [0002] There are a number of challenges in serving a hot beverage to a consumer. If the cup or glass is not hot enough, it cools the beverage inside and the consumer can be served a beverage at less than the optimal temperature for consumption. [0003] The problem is currently overcome by stacking (sometimes irregular shaped) cups and glasses on top of a hot espresso machine or into a cup warmer hot box or hot tray. [0004] The current cup and glass warmer solutions are very inefficient and waste valuable - energy (many coffee machines have an independent heater for cup warming) - bench space; and, - time. [0005] Where the operator has chosen a below bench espresso machine, the cup and glass warming space requirement is severely exacerbated. [0006] The current methods used to warm cups and glasses give inconsistent outcomes - some cups may be nearer or further from the heat source. Some food service operators resort to methods such as covering the cup warmer tray with a towel to get a reliable, consistent cup temperature. FAST CUP AND GLASS WARMER OPERATION [0007] The cup or glass is placed in close proximity to the compact heat or electromagnetic energy source that heats the cup or glass very quickly. [0008] The cup and glass warmer design allows a variety of cup and glass sizes. [0009] The fast heating is achieved in approximately thirty seconds either prior to or while the hot beverage is being prepared. [0010] The cup and glass heating gives a consistent, repeatable, even heating. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0011] The present invention relates to the need for hot cups and glasses in which to serve hot beverages and limited bench space in commercial food service environments. [0012] The present invention relates to the needs to conserve bench space and have an abundant supply of hot cups and glasses for use. [0013] The present invention relates to the needs to simplify functions that currently have more manual steps stacking and unstacking. [0014] This innovation vastly improves the space commercial operations that choose a below bench coffee machine. [0015] The present invention relates to the needs to achieve a consistent even heat for serving cups and glasses.
