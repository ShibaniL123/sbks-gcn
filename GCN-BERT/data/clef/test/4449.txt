SEQUENCE LISTING STATEMENT The ASCII file, entitled 55709SequenceListing.txt, created on Jan. 20, 2013, comprising 138,805 bytes, submitted concurrently with the filing of this application is incorporated herein by reference. FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to isolated cell populations comprising mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs), and more particularly, but not exclusively, to methods of generating same and using same for producing and isolating extracellular matrix which can be used for preparation of implantable devices for tissue regeneration and/or repair. The aim of regenerative medicine is to repair or replace damaged or diseased tissue in the human body. Cell therapy based upon stem and progenitor cells have many distinct advantages and offer tremendous potential for regenerative medicine. The multipotency and proliferative nature of stem cells makes them a more reliable cell source than terminally differentiated cells. Stem cells have additional advantage of being relatively more immune-compatible cells. In addition, stem cells can proliferate well on a supportive scaffold, and their cell fate can be further controlled and directed by their interactions with the synthetic scaffold (Lim S H and Mao H Q, 2009, Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, 61: 1084-1096). Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from either bone marrow or adipose tissues are multipotent cells that can differentiate into various lineages including osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages, and as such can be used to enhance repair of a variety of soft tissue defects. However, adult MSCs exhibit a limited capacity to proliferate, loss of differentiation potential and reduced protective factors during ex-vivo expansion before possible therapeutic use. In addition, adult stem cells isolated from different subjects exhibit remarkable variability. Moreover, while isolation of adult MSCs from a human body involves invasive procedures, aging and aging-related disorders significantly impair the survival and differentiation capacity of MSCs, thus limiting their therapeutic efficacy. Due to these limitations, adult stem cells are not suitable for “off the shelf product” such as for production of extracellular matrix (ECM). Mesenchymal stem cell-like cells can be generated from pluripotent stem cells capable of differentiation into cells of all three embryonic germ layers (i.e., endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm) such as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). In contrast to adult stem cells, pluripotent stem cells can potentially indefinitely proliferate, providing a large number of cells with specific characteristics needed for regenerative medicine protocols. However, the practical use of pluripotent stem cells as a source for ECM, requires the development of simple and efficient protocols to generate “easy to grow” cell populations that can produce functional ECM for regenerative medicine. Harkness L et al. 2010 (“Selective isolation and differentiation of a stromal population of human embryonic stem cells with osteogenic potential”. Bone Sep 30. Epub ahead of print) describe the direct differentiation of hESCs into stroma-like cells which differentiate into the osteogenic lineage while producing a mineralized matrix and into the adipogenic lineage while producing fat drops. Hwang N S et al. 2008 (PNAS 105: 20641-20646) describe derivation of hESCs to MSCs capable of producing fat, cartilage and bone in vitro. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are somatic cells that have been reprogrammed into a pluripotent state resembling that of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Patient-specific iPSCs can provide useful platforms for the discovery of new drugs, as well as unprecedented insights into disease mechanisms that ultimately may be used to develop cell and tissue replacement therapies (Kiskinis E, and Eggan K. J. Clin. Investigation, 120: 51-59, 2010). Human iPSCs (hiPSCs) have been generated from various types of somatic cells, most commonly fibroblasts that are isolated from tissues harvested via surgical intervention. Novak et al., 2010 [Cell Reprogram. 2010, 12(6): 665-78)] describe the derivation of hiPSCs from plucked human hair follicle keratinocytes (HFKTs) which spontaneously differentiated into functional cardiomyocytes (CMs). Lian Q et al., 2010 (Circulation. 121:1113-1123) have recently demonstrated the differentiation potential of hiPSCs into functional MSCs, using single cell sorting of CD105+/CD24− of differentiating hiPSCs. The resulting MSCs were capable of differentiation into adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages. Li F. et al., 2010 (JCB 109: 643-652), describe the differentiation of murine iPSCs towards MSC-like cells by treating iPSC-derived-EBs with transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ1) and retinoic acid. The resulting cells expressed putative MSCs markers and deposited calcium in vitro when cultured in an osteogenic medium. WO/2007/080590 provides methods of generating multipotent connective tissue progenitor cells (CTPs) from embryonic stem cells and embryoid bodies. The CTPs population included 40-60% of CD105-positive cells. WO/2007/080591 provides methods of generating multipotent connective tissue progenitor cells (CTPs) from adult stem cells. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a secreted product of cells that populate in a given tissue or organ. The ECM influences the behavior and phenotype of the resident cells. Cell attachment, migration, proliferation and three-dimensional arrangement are strongly affected by matrix composition and structure. The main advantages of using ECM scaffolds are their bioactivity and biocompatibility capabilities. ECM composition includes the most abundant protein—type I Collagen, as well as fibronectin and laminin. Other substantial components are glycosaminoglycans, as chrondrotin sulfate, heparin and hyaluronic acid, which have superior binding properties of bioactive molecules as growth factors and cytokines. Growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and TGFβ, are present within the ECM in very small quantities but play a critical role as potent modulators of cell behavior. Individual components of the ECM, such as collagen I or fibronectin have been used as alternative scaffold materials, but were found to be less bioactive than the whole intact ECM. ECMs for clinical applications are currently derived from organs such as the small intestine, urinary bladder or skin (Reing J., et al. 2009, Tissue Engineering, Vol. 15: 605-614′ Badylak S F. 2004. Transplant Immunology 12: 367-377), from allogeneic (human cadavers) or xenogeneic sources (porcine, bovine or equine small intestine submucosa, dermis and pericardium). Both cellular and acellular forms of ECM scaffolds have been used for tissue engineering applications. While the cellular form requires an autologous cell source, which is limited and may lead to patient's diminished functionality, the acellular form requires tissue processing, including elimination of all intact cells and degradation of nucleic acids, leaving only the ECM's proteins and growth factors biologically active. An example of a biological scaffold made of human cadaver is the GraftJacket™ product (Wright Medical Technology, TN, USA). The ultimate goal in decellularizing a tissue, composed predominantly of Collagen fibers, is to remove any non-collagen components that may cause host rejection. However, in many cases the decellularization process is not complete and the scaffold includes traces of animal compounds, which elicit a significant inflammation response. In addition, cadaver donors are limited, thus scaffold made of this source are non-homogeneous, and non-reproducible. In addition, since derived from a human source, these scaffolds still exhibit the risk of pathogen transfer. ECM mineralization is a physiologic process in bone, teeth, and hypertrophic cartilage, whereas in other locations it must be inhibited. Mineralization imparts important biomechanical and other functional properties to bones and teeth. Synthetic scaffolds are manufactured from chemical compounds such as polyester, polypropylene, dacron, silicon and nylon fabric. Although they possess superior mechanical characteristics, they can never be integrated into the host tissue, and their poor biocompatibility causes numerous long-term complications, such as severe infections, chronic immune response and potential toxic byproducts (Chen J. et al. Expert Rev. Med. Devices, 2009, 6: 61-73). Electrospinning can produce a macroporous scaffold comprising randomly oriented or aligned nanofibers. Electrospun polymeric fibrous meshes also offer a higher surface area for cell attachment and are relatively reproducible (Lim S H and Mao H Q, 2009; Adv. Drug. Del. Rev. 61:1084-1096). Thibault R A et al. (Tissue Engineering, 2010, 16: 431-440) describe generation of a decellularized mineralized matrix from electrospun PCL fiber mesh scaffolds which were seeded with rat mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cultured in a complete osteogenic medium. WO/2009/098698 describes scaffolds composed of extracts of cellular and/or extracellular compartments for use in tissue regeneration. The challenge in any reconstructive procedure is to provide a supporting structure while restoring the normal anatomic condition of the surrounding tissues. Though several materials can potentially provide the mechanical support, they do not possess the properties necessary to restore the living tissue's original quality. Abdominal ventral hernia and pelvic floor defect (PFD) are common and challenging conditions for surgeons. It is estimated that 250,000 hernia repair and 300,000 procedures of prolapse and urinary incontinence surgeries are performed each year in the US. However, in about 12.5% of the hernia repair and 29% of the pelvic prolapse repairs repeated surgeries are needed within 5 years of initial surgery, mainly due to infection, seroma, wound dehiscence and formation of enterocutaneous fistula. Synthetic meshes made of polypropylene and polyester are used for reconstructive surgeries (e.g., the Gyncare Prolift, Ethicon®, Johnson & Johnson, USA). Although the synthetic meshes are available and can simplify the operative procedure, reduce patient discomfort from an additional incision site and decrease operative time, in about 2.8-17.3% of the cases these meshes cause foreign-body reaction with risks of infection, rejection, visceral adhesion to the repair site, erosion to the bowel, urinary bladder and vaginal mucosa leading to enterocutaneous fistula, bowel obstruction and urinary bladder complications, extrusion of the repair material and infection. Infected synthetic repair material often necessitates surgical removal, leaving a contaminated field and a hernia deficit larger than the original (van't Riet M, et al., 2007. Hernia. 11:409-13; de Vries Reilingh T S, et al., 2007, World J. Surg. 31:756-63).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color. Copies of this patent or patent application publication with color drawing(s) will be provided by the Office upon request and payment of the necessary fee. Some embodiments of the invention are herein described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings. With specific reference now to the drawings in detail, it is stressed that the particulars shown are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of embodiments of the invention. In this regard, the description taken with the drawings makes apparent to those skilled in the art how embodiments of the invention may be practiced. In the drawings: FIGS. 1A-H are images depicting the generation of mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) from pluripotent stem cells according to some embodiments of the invention. FIG. 1A—depicts the steps of generating transgene-free induced pluripotent stem cells from hair follicle keratinocytes (HFKTs) which were further used to generate the MPCs according to some embodiments of the invention. HFKTs (FIG. 1A(i)) were reprogrammed using a single lentiviral STEMCCA vector [Somers, A., et al. 2010. Generation of transgene-free lung disease-specific human iPS cells using a single excisable lentiviral stem cells cassette. Stem Cells, 28(10):1728-40; Sommer, C. A., et al., 2009. Induced pluripotent stem cell generation using a single lentiviral stem cell cassette. Stem Cells 27, 543-549) harboring the reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc). FIG. 1A(ii) shows the resulting induced pluripotent stem cell (HFKT-iPSC). Excision of the lentiviral STEMCCA vector (the transgene) with cre-recombinase resulted in a viral-free (transgene-free) iPSC clone (FIG. 1A(iii)). FIG. 1B—is an image of colony of human embryonic stem cells H9.2 cell line which was used for generation of MPCs according the method of some embodiments of the invention. FIG. 1C—embryoid bodies (EBs) were generated by the spontaneous differentiation of iPSCs (HFKT-iPSCs clone KTN7 and transgene-free HFKT-iPSCs clones: Cre-KTN7.3 and Cre-KTR 13.4) or hESCs-H9.2. Shown are 10-days EBs. FIG. 1D—MPCs according to some embodiments of the invention generated from the EBs. The EBs were dissociated by Collagenase B to small cell clusters of about 10-30 cells (e.g., 20 cells), which were cultured for 2-3 days in a BHK medium, which comprises ascorbic acid but is devoid of dexamethasone. Shown are the cell clusters following 2 days of culturing in the BHK medium). FIGS. 1E-G—images of mesenchymal progenitor cells derived from hESCs (FIG. 1E), or from HFKTs-iPSCs which were either non-excised by Cre-recombinase (FIG. 1F) or excised by Cre-recombinase (transgene-free) (FIG. 1G). FIG. 1H—an image of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Note that the morphology of the mesenchymal progenitor cells generated according to the method of some embodiments of the invention (FIGS. 1E-G) is similar to that of MSCs isolated from adipose tissue (FIG. 1H), which is used as a gold standard for MSCs. Also note that the excised HFKT-iPSCs Cre-KTN7.3 derived MPCs culture (FIG. 1G) is very homogeneous and condense relative to MPCs isolated from hESCs or from the transgene-containing HFKT-iPSCs. FIGS. 2A-G—Characterization of adipose derived MSCs by FACs analysis of typical MSCs markers. FIG. 2A—CD29; FIG. 2B—CD44; FIG. 2C—CD105; FIG. 2D—CD73; FIG. 2E—CD90; FIG. 2F—CD34; FIG. 2G—CD45. Results show that the adipose derived MSCs can be used as gold standard since they express high levels of known mesenchymal markers as: CD29 (94.98%), CD44 (99.84%), CD105 (98.56%), CD73 (100%), CD90 (91.5%) and are negative to the hematopoietic markers CD34 (1.27%) and CD45 (0.84%). FIG. 2H—A histogram depicting MPCs characterization using FACS analysis of typical mesenchymal markers. Shown are the percentages of positive cells for each of the mesenchymal and hematopoietic markers. The MPCs were derived from the following sources: hESCs (blue bars), HFKT-iPSCs-Clone KTN7 (red bars) and the excised HFKT-iPSCs-Clones Cre-KTN7.3 (green bars) and Cre-KTR13.4 (purple bars). Results show that MPCs derived from the excised HFKT-iPSC clones express higher levels of mesenchymal markers (CD105, CD90, CD73, CD44 and CD29) relative to MPCs derived from non-excised KTN7 or from hESCs. Data were obtained relative to the negative control cells stained with only a secondary antibody. FIGS. 3A-L are images depicting the results of in vitro differentiation assays of MSCs which were derived from adipose tissue (FIGS. 3A, 3E, 3I), hESCs-derived MPCs (FIGS. 3B, 3F, 3J), human HFKT-non-excised-iPSCs derived MPCs (FIGS. 3C, 3G, 3K), and human HFKT-excised-iPSCs derived MPCs (FIGS. 3D, 3H, 3L). Bone differentiation was analyzed using Alizarin-red staining following 30 days in an osteogenic medium (FIGS. 3A-D); Fat Differentiation was analyzed using Oil-Red O staining following 30 days in an adipogenic medium (FIGS. 3E-H); Cartilage differentiation was analyzed by Alcian-Blue staining following 30 days in a chondrogenic medium (FIGS. 3I-L). Results show that all cell lines are positive for Alizarin-red staining, indicating calcium deposition by cells of an osteogenic lineage. In addition, while cartilage differentiation was most efficient with the excised HFKT-iPSCs derived MPCs (FIG. 3L) and the non-excised HFKT-iPSCs derived MPCs (FIG. 3K), adipogenic differentiation was pronounced in adipose-derived MSCs (FIG. 3E), but was hardly evident in hESC-derived MPCs (FIG. 3F) and completely absent in HFKT-iPSCs-derived MPCs (FIGS. 3G and H). Results represent exemplary data of three independent repeated experiments. FIGS. 4A-J are images of tissue culture plates depicting in vitro differentiation of adipose-derived MSCs and pluripotent stem cells-derived MPCs into the osteogenic lineage. Adipose MSCs (FIGS. 4A-B), HFKT-iPSCs Cre KTR13.4 (FIGS. 4C-D), hESCs MPCs clone 1 (FIGS. 4E-F), HFKT-iPSCs CreKTN7.3 MPCs (FIGS. 4G-H) and hESCs MPCs clone 2 (FIGS. 4I-J) were cultured for 4 weeks in either a non-inducing medium (BHK medium; FIGS. 4A, C, E, G, and I) or an osteogenic inducing medium (osteogenic medium; FIGS. 4B, D, F, H and J) and the cells were then stained with Alizarin-red. Note that bone differentiation is highly elevated in MPCs derived from the excised HFKT-iPSCs clones relative to MPCs derived from hESCs clones or from adipose MSCs. FIGS. 5A-X—Histology analyses of extracellular matrix (ECM) generated from adult human adipose MSCs (FIGS. 5A, 5E, 5I, 5M, 5Q, 5U) as well as from MPCs generated from the pluripotent sources: hESCs (FIGS. 5B, 5F, 5J, 5N, 5R, 5V), and HFKT-iPSCs clone KTN7 (FIGS. 5C, 5G, 5K, 5O, 5S, 5W) and the excised clone Cre-KTN7.3 (FIGS. 5D, 5H, 5L, 5P, 5T, 5X). Trichrome (TC) staining stained all collagens by a strong blue dye (FIGS. 5A-5D). Immunostainings were done with antibodies against actin (FIGS. 5E-H), Collagen IV (FIGS. 5I-5L), Vimentin (FIGS. 5M-P), fibronectin (FIGS. 5Q-T) and laminin (FIGS. 5U-X). Results show that all MPCs tested produce high quantities of ECM collagens (FIGS. 5B-D) as compared to the ECM quantities produced by adipose-derived MSCs (FIG. 5A), with most significant ECM components could be detected at ECM generated by the excised HFKT-iPSCs clones (results show here for Cre-KTN7.3 clone, similar data were found for the other excised clone Cre-KTR13.4 (Data not shown). Immunostaining of ECM generated from all stem cells sources revealed positive expression of specific ECM proteins including actin, collagen IV, fibronection, laminin and vimentin. However, round structures of actin protein were found only within ECM derived MPCs originated from transgene-free HFKT-iPSCs. This ECM source also exhibits higher and specific expression of collagen IV, fibronectin and Laminin relative to other pluripotent sources that were tested. FIGS. 6A-H—are RT-PCR analyses depicting gene expression of ECM markers. RT-PCR was done for ECM samples generated by the following cell sources: Adipose derived MSCs (lane 1), hESCs derived MPCs (lane 2), KTN7 derived MPCs (lane 3), Cre-KTN7.3 derived MPCs (lane 4), Cre-KTR13.4 derived MPCs (lane 5). FIG. 6A—Fibronectin; FIG. 6B—Decorin; FIG. 6C—Tensacin C; FIG. 6D—Biglycan; FIG. 6E—Collagen I; FIG. 6F—Collagen III; FIG. 6G—Elastin; FIG. 6H—GAPDH. Results show that most markers were highly expressed in the ECM samples obtained from the excised HFKT-iPSCs clones Cre-KTN7.3 and Cre-KTR13.4. FIGS. 7A-H are images of seeded nanofibers layer (NFL) with live cells or acellularized NFL. MPCs derived from the excised HFKT-iPSCs clone KTN7.3 were seeded on the NFL and cultured for 3-4 weeks in the BHK medium which enables ECM generation. Live cells staining was done using Vybrabt© CFDA SE cell tracker kit (Invitrogen). Acellularization treatment on NFL-ECM includes incubation in hypertonic solution and then tritonX100 and DNAse treatment. FIG. 7A—image of fluorescent microscopy of NFL with live cells; FIG. 7B—image of fluorescent microscopy of acellularized NFL. The live cells staining show the efficiency of MPCs propagation within the NFL. Following acellularization treatment cells could be eliminated from the NFL. FIGS. 7C-7H—images obtained by confocal microscopy analysis of nanofibers with live cells (FIGS. 7C-E) and acellularized nanofibers (FIGS. 7F-H). Shown are representative images of the upper slices (FIGS. 7C, 7F), middle slices (FIGS. 7D, 7G) and lower slices (FIGS. 7E, 7H). Note that the cells efficiently penetrate to internal layers of the scaffold, shown by the various slices. This analysis indicates that cells proliferated within the NFL, and not only on the NFL surface. FIGS. 8A-B are scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images depicting live cells (KTR13.4 MPCs) on PLGA-NFL (FIG. 6A) and PLGA-NFL following acellularization (FIG. 6B). Size bar=200 μm. FIGS. 8C-F are images of high magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) depicting generation of ECM on PLGA-NFL scaffolds. PLGA-NFLs were seeded with Cre-KTR13.4 MPCs and cultured for several weeks in the presence of the BHK medium. At predetermined time points, 0 (no cells were seeded) (FIG. 8C), one week (FIG. 8D), two weeks (FIG. 8E) and three weeks (FIG. 8F) in culture. The scaffolds were subject to an acellularization process and photographed using SEM. Note the structure of the PLGA nanofibers in the absence of cells in FIG. 8C. Following 1 and 2 weeks of culturing the MPCs on the NFL ECM proteins, manifested as collagen fibers, are shown within the NFL, while following 3 weeks MPCs derived ECM has completely covered the NFL surface. FIGS. 9A-F are images depicting histology characterization of ECM generated within the NFL before (FIGS. 9A-C) and following (FIGS. 9-F) the acellularization process. ECM was generated from MPCs derived from HFKT-iPSCs Cre-KTR13.4 clone cultured within PLGA-NFL for 3 weeks. FIGS. 9A and D—Hematoxylline and eosine (H&E) staining; FIGS. 9B and E—trichrom (TC) staining; FIGS. 9C and F—fibronectin immunostaining. Acellular ECM-NFL was characterized by H&E staining indicating the elimination of viable cells (FIG. 9D) as compared to cellular ECM-NFL (FIG. 9A). Trichrom (TC) staining and fibronectin immunostaining indicate that ECM proteins were generated within the NFL and remain intact following acellularization treatment. FIGS. 10A-H are photographs of mice demonstrating subcutaneous transplantation of synthetic mesh (Prolift®, Ethicon) (FIGS. 10A, 10C, 10E and 10G), and NFL-ECM construct (FIGS. 10B, 10D, 10F and 10H) in SCID beige mice (FIGS. 10A-B; FIGS. 10E-F) and Sprague-Dawley Rats (FIGS. 10C-D and FIGS. 10G-H). The implants were originally sutured and well covered by the animal skin. Two identical implants were transplanted in both neck sides of SCID Beige mice, and within two thighs of the rat (FIGS. 10A-D). Eight weeks post transplantation (FIGS. 10E-H) the animals were sacrificed and analyzed and implants were subjected to histology analysis. Note that 8 weeks post transplantation in both transplanted SCID mice and rats 75% of synthetic meshes implants were completely discharged and could be clearly observed externally of the animal skin (FIGS. 10E and 10G). Moreover, the SCID mice transplanted with the synthetic mesh exhibit a sick and slim appearance as compared with the mice transplanted by NFL-ECM (e.g., compare the mouse in FIG. 10E to the mouse in FIG. 10F). In addition, note that the NFL-ECM implants were not rejected from the animal's body and the transplanted SCID mice were big and healthy. Also note that rats transplanted with the NFL-ECM were healthy with complete healing of the wound (FIG. 10H) as compared to the rat sutured with the synthetic mesh (FIG. 10G). FIGS. 11A-D are images of histological sections of synthetic mesh implants sections in SCID mice (FIGS. 11A and 11C) and rats (FIGS. 11B and 11D). Histology was done for paraffin sections using hematoxilin & Eosin (HE) (FIGS. 11A and 11D) and trichrome (TC) staining (FIGS. 11B and 11C). Data revealed rigorous granuloma containing lymphocytes and neutrophils surrounding the synthetic fibers, observed as blue and white ellipsoids which are not stained by the histochemistry reagents. Magnification: ×5 in FIGS. 11A and 11B; ×40 in FIGS. 11C and 11D. FIGS. 12A-F are images of histological sections of NFL-ECM implants sections in SCID mice (FIGS. 12B and 12E) and rats (FIGS. 12C and 12F) and in mice which were transplanted with NFL implant (FIGS. 12A and 12D). Results show that implants from NFL, made of electrospun PCL polymer (with no ECM), significantly induced the animal immune response (FIGS. 12A and 12D). Granulomas, particularly containing macrophages, are observed within the NFL region, surrounding by the PCL nanofibers which were not completely degraded following 8 weeks in vivo (FIGS. 12A and 12D). In contrast, the immune response against the hybrid NFL-ECM implant is reduced in both SCID mice and rats (FIGS. 12B, 12C, 12E and 12F). Although granuloma regions could be observed within the hybrid, better integration with the host tissue was visible, strong collagen structures were generated around and within the hybrid device (arrow 1) and new blood vessels were emerged (arrow 2). Magnification: ×5 in FIGS. 12A-C; ×20 in FIGS. 12D-F. FIGS. 13A-F are images depicting RT-PCR analysis of adipogenic markers in adipose-derived MSCs and pluripotent stem cells-derived MPCs following their differentiation into adipogenic lineages. Total RNA was extracted from cells after 4 weeks of culturing in adipogenic medium and RT-PCR was performed with primer specific to the following mRNA: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPARγ) (FIG. 13A); leptin (FIG. 13B); adiponectin (FIG. 13C); Adipocyte protein 2 (AP2) (FIG. 13D); Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (FIG. 13E); and GAPDH (FIG. 13F). Results are shown for the following clones: Lane 1—Adipose MSCs—AD5T; lane 2—HFKT-iPSCs Cre-KTR13.4 MPCs; lane 3—HFKT-iPSCs Cre-KTN7.3 MPCs; lane 4—hESCs (H9.2) derived MPCs (clone 1); lane 5—hESCs (H9.2) derived MPCs (clone 2); lane 6—No DNA (negative control).

The scaffolds were originally sutured and well covered by the animal skin. Two identical implants were transplanted within the rat's two thighs. Eight weeks post transplantation the animals were sacrificed and implants were subjected to histology analysis of paraffin sections.

FIGS. 15A-D are images depicting the NET-NFL-ECM device. A synthetic Net (Prolift, Ethicon) (FIG. 15A) is coated by nanofibers layer (NFL) using electrospinning of either PCL, PLGA or a combination of PCL/PLGA nanofibers (FIG. 15B). The coated mesh was used as a substrate for MPC culturing and ECM secretion during 4 weeks in the presence of BHK medium. The hybrid device is subjected to acellularization process and then to lyophilization (FIG. 15C). SEM analysis of the hybrid NET-NFL-ECM device is shown in FIG. 15D and demonstrate that the ECM fully covers the NFL. FIGS. 16A-D are images depicting Net transplantation in the rat abdominal wall. Two control implants, Net (prolift, Ethicon) and NFL (30 μm wideness), no ECM) were transplanted in the abdominal wall of one rat. Following 8 weeks the rats were sacrificed, the implant area was exposed and a sample from the implant surrounding tissue was subjected to histology analysis.

FIGS. 18A-C are photographs of microscopic slides showing slices obtained from paraffin sections depicting Net-NFL (Nanofiber layers) implants following transplantation in the rat abdominal wall. NFL implants were generated using the Prolift™ (Ethicon, Sommerville, N.J., USA) net coated with 30 μm PCL nanofibers, which was used as a substrate for culturing either adult adipose derived MSCs—AD5T [Net-NFL-ECM (AD5T); FIG. 18A] or HFKT-iPSCs-Cre KTN7.3 MPCs [Net-NFL-ECM (KTN7.3); FIG. 18B), or without culturing of MPCs and thus without ECM (Net-NFL, FIG. 18C). Following 4 weeks of culturing, the hybrid devices were subjected to an acellularization procedure and transplanted into the rat abdominal wall. Two duplicates were transplanted from each scaffold type. Eight weeks post transplantation the implants were removed along with the surrounding tissue, stained with Trichrome and photographed. Note the width and connection with the rat muscle tissue of the different implants. The Net-NFL without ECM is very thin and almost no new rat tissues were generated within this implant, while the implants including ECM are much wider, with a clear regeneration of rat's new tissue. Also, the implants made of Net-NFL-ECM are connected to the rat muscle tissue while the Net-NFL devoid of ECM is not connected to the rat muscle tissue. FIGS. 18D-F are photographs of microscopic images depicting histological analysis of the NFL implants 8 weeks post transplantation as described in the description of FIGS. 18A-C above. The histological sections were stained with H&E staining (magnification ×10). Note the significant new generation of blood vessels in implants made of NET-NFL-ECM derived from HFKT-iPSCs-Cre KTN7.3 MPCs (FIG. 18F), as compared to implants made of NET-NFL-ECM derived from AD5T cells (FIG. 18E), and the absence of any blood vessels in tissues implanted with the Net-NFL devoid of ECM (FIG. 18D). FIGS. 18G-O are photographs of microscopic images depicting histological analysis of the NFL implants 8 weeks post transplantation as described in the description of FIGS. 18A-C above. The histological sections were stained with TC staining and show the localization of the implants within the rat tissues. Magnifications are ×4 (FIGS. 18G, J, M, H, K and N) and ×10 (FIGS. 18I, L and O). Note that while the Net-NFL implant was located at the external fat tissue (FIG. 18H), the Net-NFL-ECM implants were located at their original site near the rat's muscle tissue (FIGS. 18K and N). FIGS. 18I, L and O demonstrate that no significant immune response occurred around the implants, but massive fibrous collagen structure was generated within the ECM derived implants (FIGS. 18L and O). DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to an isolated population of mesenchymal progenitor cells, methods of generating same, and using same for producing massive amounts of extracellular matrix which can be used for various tissue regeneration and repair applications. Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not necessarily limited in its application to the details set forth in the following description or exemplified by the Examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. The present inventors have uncovered a novel method of isolating extracellular matrix (ECM) from pluripotent stem cells. Thus, as described in the Examples section which follows, the present inventors were capable following laborious experimentations to isolate a novel population of mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) from embryoid bodies (FIGS. 1A-H, Example 1 of the Examples section which follows). About 80-100% of the isolated MPCs are characterized by the CD29+/CD44+/CD105+/CD73+/CD90+/CD45−/CD34− expression signature (FIG. 2H, Example 2 of the Examples section which follows). In addition, while MPCs isolated from the pluripotent stem cells were capable of differentiation into the chondrogenic lineages in a similar manner as did adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (FIGS. 3I-L, Example 3), the MPCs isolated from the pluripotent stem cells exhibited a markedly reduced differentiation ability towards the adipogenic lineage as determined by Oil-Red O staining (FIGS. 3F-H; Example 3) when compared to adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (FIG. 3E; Example 3). Further RT-PCR analyses revealed a markedly reduced expression level of adipogenic markers such as leptin, adiponectin, Adipocyte protein 2 (AP2) and Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in MPCs as compared to the level in adipose MSCs (FIG. 13B-E; Example 3). In addition, MPCs isolated from iPSCs exhibited a markedly increased expression of Alizarine red as compared to MPCs isolated from hESCs or MSCs from an adipose source (FIGS. 4A-J; Example 3). As is further described in the Examples section which follows, the ECM produced by the MPCs included Collagen, actin, vimentin, fibronectin, laminin, decorin, tensacin C and elastin (FIGS. 5A-X, 6A-H; Example 4 of the Examples section which follows). In addition, when culturing the MPCs on nanofibers produced by electrospinning the present inventors obtained a hybrid device in which the ECM penetrate within internal layers of the nanofiber (FIGS. 7A-H, 8A-F, 9A-F; Example 5 of the Examples section which follows). Moreover, in vivo transplantation of the hybrid device in injured tissues of animals was found to be superior in terms of compatibility and bioactivity over implantation of synthetic meshes (FIGS. 10A-H, 11A-D, 12A-F; Example 6 of the Examples section which follows). Thus, transplantation into rats of a device composed of PLGA nanofiber layers (NFL) and ECM generated from the MPCs (e.g., the HFKT-iPSCs Cre KTN7.3 MPCs) resulted in good integration into the host tissue with the emergence of new and large blood vessels at the implant site, with a reduced host immune response as compared to NFLs without the ECM (FIGS. 14A-I, Example 7). Furthermore, transplantation of a device composed of a synthetic mesh (net), nanofiber layers (e.g., PCL, PLGA or a combination thereof), and ECM generated from MPCs resulted in a better integration into the host tissue as compared to transplantation of the synthetic mesh alone (FIGS. 16A-D, and 17A-D; Example 8) or as compared to a device made of the net-NFL and ECM generated from adult MSCs (e.g., AD5T) (FIGS. 18D-F; Example 8). In addition, while no significant immune response occurred around any of the implants (FIGS. 18I, L and O), a massive fibrous collagen structure was generated within the ECM-derived implants (FIGS. 18L and O; Example 8), demonstrating that these implants also contributes to angiogenesis and integration of the implant within the rat tissues. These results demonstrate the production of isolated ECM, a device made of nanofibers and ECM, with or without a synthetic mesh, which are suitable for tissue regeneration and repair. Thus, according to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention there is provided a method of generating mesenchymal progenitor cells from embryoid bodies (EBs). The method is effected by: (a) dissociating the EBs into cell aggregates, (b) culturing the cell aggregates in a culture medium so as to expand a population of adherent cells by at least 2 folds, and (c) dissociating the adherent cells to single cells, and (d) culturing the single cells for at least one passage in a culture medium which comprises ascorbic acid but being devoid of dexamethasone, thereby generating the mesenchymal progenitor cells from the embryoid bodies. As used herein the phrase “mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs)” refers to cells which are not terminally differentiated but exhibit a reduced differentiation potential to mesenchymal cell lineages as compared to naturally occurring mesenchymal stem cells derived from an adult tissue. As used herein the phrase “mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)” refers to cells derived from an adult tissue which are capable of differentiation into at least cells of an osteogenic lineage (e.g., osteoblasts), cells of an adipogenic lineage (e.g., adipose cells), and cells of a chondrogenic lineage (e.g., chondrocytes). As used herein the phrase “embryoid bodies” refers to three dimensional multicellular aggregates of differentiated and undifferentiated cells derivatives of three embryonic germ layers. Embryoid bodies are formed upon the removal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from feeder layers or feeder cells-free culture systems. ESCs and/or iPSCs removal can be effected using type IV Collagenase treatment for a limited time. Following dissociation from the culturing surface, the cells are transferred to tissue culture plates containing a culture medium supplemented with serum and amino acids. During the culturing period, EBs are further monitored for their differentiation state. Cell differentiation can be determined upon examination of cell or tissue-specific markers which are known to be indicative of differentiation. For example, to EB-derived-differentiated cells may express the neurofilament 68 KD which is a characteristic marker of the ectoderm cell lineage. The differentiation level of the EB cells can be monitored by following the loss of expression of Oct-4, and the increased expression level of other markers such as α-fetoprotein, NF-68 kDa, α-cardiac and albumin Methods useful for monitoring the expression level of specific genes are well known in the art and include RT-PCR, semi-quantitative RT-PCR, Northern blot, RNA in situ hybridization, Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Embryoid bodies can be generated from pluripotent stem cells of various primates and mammals such as human, monkeys and rodents (e.g., mouse, rat). According to some embodiments of the invention, the embryoid bodies are obtained from human embryoid bodies. According to some embodiments of the invention, the embryoid bodies are obtained by spontaneous differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. The phrase “embryonic stem cells” refers to embryonic cells which are capable of differentiating into cells of all three embryonic germ layers (i.e., endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm), or remaining in an undifferentiated state. The phrase “embryonic stem cells” may read on cells which are obtained from the embryonic tissue formed after gestation (e.g., blastocyst) before implantation of the embryo (i.e., a pre-implantation blastocyst), extended blastocyst cells (EBCs) which are obtained from a post-implantation/pre-gastrulation stage blastocyst (see WO2006/040763) and embryonic germ (EG) cells which are obtained from the genital tissue of a fetus any time during gestation, preferably before 10 weeks of gestation. The embryonic stem cells of some embodiments of the invention can be obtained using well-known cell-culture methods. For example, human embryonic stem cells can be isolated from human blastocysts. Human blastocysts are typically obtained from human in vivo preimplantation embryos or from in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos. Alternatively, a single cell human embryo can be expanded to the blastocyst stage. For the isolation of human ES cells the zona pellucida is removed from the blastocyst and the inner cell mass (ICM) is isolated by immunosurgery, in which the trophectoderm cells are lysed and removed from the intact ICM by gentle pipetting. The ICM is then plated in a tissue culture flask containing the appropriate medium which enables its outgrowth. Following 9 to 15 days, the ICM derived outgrowth is dissociated into clumps either by a mechanical dissociation or by an enzymatic degradation and the cells are then re-plated on a fresh tissue culture medium. Colonies demonstrating undifferentiated morphology are individually selected by micropipette, mechanically dissociated into clumps, and re-plated. Resulting ES cells are then routinely split every 4-7 days. For further details on methods of preparation human ES cells see Thomson et al., [U.S. Pat. No. 5,843,780; Science 282: 1145, 1998; Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 38: 133, 1998; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92: 7844, 1995]; Bongso et al., [Hum Reprod 4: 706, 1989]; and Gardner et al., [Fertil. Steril. 69: 84, 1998]. It will be appreciated that commercially available stem cells can also be used according to some embodiments of the invention. Human ES cells can be purchased from the NIH human embryonic stem cells registry [Hypertext Transfer Protocol://grants (dot) nih (dot) gov/stem_cells/registry/current (dot) htm]. Non-limiting examples of commercially available embryonic stem cell lines are BG01, BG02, BG03, BG04, CY12, CY30, CY92, CY10, TE03, TE32, CHB-4, CHB-5, CHB-6, CHB-8, CHB-9, CHB-10, CHB-11, CHB-12, HUES 1, HUES 2, HUES 3, HUES 4, HUES 5, HUES 6, HUES 7, HUES 8, HUES 9, HUES 10, HUES 11, HUES 12, HUES 13, HUES 14, HUES 15, HUES 16, HUES 17, HUES 18, HUES 19, HUES 20, HUES 21, HUES 22, HUES 23, HUES 24, HUES 25, HUES 26, HUES 27, HUES 28, CyT49, RUES3, WA01, UCSF4, NYUES1, NYUES2, NYUES3, NYUES4, NYUES5, NYUES6, NYUES7, UCLA 1, UCLA 2, UCLA 3, WA077 (H7), WA09 (H9), WA13 (H13), WA14 (H14), HUES 62, HUES 63, HUES 64, CT1, CT2, CT3, CT4, MA135, Eneavour-2, WIBR1, WIBR2, WIBR3, WIBR4, WIBR5, WIBR6, HUES 45, Shef 3, Shef 6, BJNhem19, BJNhem20, SA001, SA001. In addition, ES cells can be obtained from other species as well, including mouse (Mills and Bradley, 2001), golden hamster [Doetschman et al., 1988, Dev Biol. 127: 224-7], rat [Iannaccone et al., 1994, Dev Biol. 163: 288-92] rabbit [Giles et al. 1993, Mol Reprod Dev. 36: 130-8; Graves & Moreadith, 1993, Mol Reprod Dev. 1993, 36: 424-33], several domestic animal species [Notarianni et al., 1991, J Reprod Fertil Suppl. 43: 255-60; Wheeler 1994, Reprod Fertil Dev. 6: 563-8; Mitalipova et al., 2001, Cloning. 3: 59-67] and non-human primate species (Rhesus monkey and marmoset) [Thomson et al., 1995, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 92: 7844-8; Thomson et al., 1996, Biol Reprod. 55: 254-9]. Extended blastocyst cells (EBCs) can be obtained from a blastocyst of at least nine days post fertilization at a stage prior to gastrulation. Prior to culturing the blastocyst, the zona pellucida is digested [for example by Tyrode's acidic solution (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, Mo., USA)] so as to expose the inner cell mass. The blastocysts are then cultured as whole embryos for at least nine and no more than fourteen days post fertilization (i.e., prior to the gastrulation event) in vitro using standard embryonic stem cell culturing methods. EG cells are prepared from the primordial germ cells obtained from fetuses of about 8-11 weeks of gestation (in the case of a human fetus) using laboratory techniques known to anyone skilled in the arts. The genital ridges are dissociated and cut into small chunks which are thereafter disaggregated into cells by mechanical dissociation. The EG cells are then grown in tissue culture flasks with the appropriate medium. The cells are cultured with daily replacement of medium until a cell morphology consistent with EG cells is observed, typically after 7-30 days or 1-4 passages. For additional details on methods of preparation human EG cells see Shamblott et al., [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95: 13726, 1998] and U.S. Pat. No. 6,090,622. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS; embryonic-like stem cells), are cells obtained by de-differentiation of adult somatic cells which are endowed with pluripotency (i.e., being capable of differentiating into the three embryonic germ cell layers, i.e., endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm). According to some embodiments of the invention, such cells are obtained from a differentiated tissue (e.g., a somatic tissue such as skin) and undergo de-differentiation by genetic manipulation which re-program the cell to acquire embryonic stem cells characteristics. According to some embodiments of the invention, the induced pluripotent stem cells are formed by inducing the expression of Oct-4, Sox2, Kfl4 and c-Myc in a somatic stem cell. Thus, iPS cells can be generated by retroviral transduction of somatic cells such as fibroblasts, hepatocytes, gastric epithelial cells with transcription factors such as Oct-3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and KLF4 [Yamanaka S, Cell Stem Cell. 2007, 1(1):39-49; Aoi T, et al., Generation of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Adult Mouse Liver and Stomach Cells. Science. 2008 Feb. 14. (321:699-702); IH Park, Zhao R, West J A, et al. Reprogramming of human somatic cells to pluripotency with defined factors. Nature 2008; 451:141-146; K Takahashi, Tanabe K, Ohnuki M, et al. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors. Cell 2007; 131:861-872]. Other embryonic-like stem cells can be generated by nuclear transfer to oocytes, fusion with embryonic stem cells or nuclear transfer into zygotes if the recipient cells are arrested in mitosis. According to some embodiments of the invention, the induced pluripotent stem cells are generated by reprogramming somatic cells with a single polycistronic excisable lentiviral vector (e.g., the STEMCCA vector described in Somers, A., et al. 2010. Generation of transgene-free lung disease-specific human iPS cells using a single excisable lentiviral stem cells cassette. Stem Cells, 28(10):1728-40; Sommer, C. A., et al., 2009. Induced pluripotent stem cell generation using a single lentiviral stem cell cassette. Stem Cells 27, 543-549; each of which is fully incorporated herein by reference. According to some embodiments of the invention, the somatic cells used for generating the iPSCs are keratinocytes derived from plucked hair follicles. According to some embodiments of the invention, the iPSCs are derived from plucked human hair follicle keratinocytes (iPS-HFKTs). According to some embodiments of the invention, the iPSCs are formed from a somatic cell that was reprogrammed with a viral-excisable vector that was further excised from the genome of the iPSCs, essentially as described in as described in Novak et al., 2010 [Cell Reprogram. 2010, 12(6): 665-78)] which is fully incorporated herein by reference. A non-limiting example of a viral-excisable vector is the lentiviral STEMCCA vector. According to some embodiments of the invention, the embryoid bodies or the pluripotent stem cells are derived from an individual having a normal karyotype according to the species to which the individual belong. For example, for human individuals, a normal karyotype is of 22XY or 22XX chromosomes. According to some embodiments of the invention, the embryoid bodies or the pluripotent stem cells are derived from a healthy individual. According to some embodiments of the invention, the embryoid bodies are cultured on defined, xeno-free, feeder-free culturing systems. Such feeder-free systems (e.g., using low attachment culture dishes) can include a culture medium which is serum-free, and/or xeno-free (i.e., devoid of contamination by another species, for example, devoid of animal contamination of human cells) provides a more defined environment for the EBs, which can be controlled, such as to be free of xeno-contaminant and cellular contaminants. It should be noted that for therapeutic applications, all media used to culture the cells include synthetic or recombinantly expressed components, such that the cells cultured therein are completely devoid of any xeno-contaminants. The term “xeno” is a prefix based on the Greek word “Xenos”, i.e., a stranger. As used herein the phrase “xeno-free” refers to being devoid of any components which are derived from a xenos (i.e., not the same, a foreigner) species. Such components can be contaminants such as pathogens associated with (e.g., infecting) the xeno species, cellular components of the xeno species or a-cellular components (e.g., fluid) of the xeno species. According to some embodiments of the invention, the EBs used by the method of some embodiments of the invention are derived from about 8-14 days of differentiation of human EBs, e.g., about 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14 day-old human EBs. According to some embodiments of the invention, the EBs used by the method of some embodiments of the invention are 10-day-old human EBs. It should be noted that the first day of EBs differentiation is considered about 24 hours after the pluripotent stem cells were allowed to differentiate in vitro by removing the pluripotent stem cells from their undifferentiated culture conditions, such as by removing them from feeder layers or from their feeder-free culture systems (e.g., matrix such as an extracellular matrix). As described, the method of some embodiments of the invention comprises dissociating the EBs into cell aggregates. According to some embodiments of the invention, each of the aggregates formed by dissociating the EBs comprises about 10-30 cells, e.g., between about 12-28 cells, e.g., between about 15-25 cells, e.g., about 20 cells. According to some embodiments of the invention, the dissociation of EBs is performed by treatment with Collagenase and optionally also with DNAse I. The Collagenase can be Collagenase B (e.g., available from Roche, catalogue number 11 088 807 001) used in a concentration in the range of about 0.1-5 mg/ml (e.g., in PBS), e.g., about 0.5-3 mg/ml, e.g., about 0.8-2 mg/ml, e.g., about 0.8-1.5 mg/ml, e.g., about 1 mg/ml Collagenase B. The DNAse I (e.g., available from Roche, catalogue number 2139) can be used in a concentration of about 10-500 U/ml, e.g., about 50-350 U/ml, e.g., about 100-200 U/ml, e.g., about 150 U/ml DNAse I. Incubation with the Collagenase and DNAse I solution can be performed while shaking the vessel containing the EBs, for an incubation time which may vary between about 5-30 minutes, e.g., between about 10-25 minutes, e.g., between about 15-20 minutes, e.g., about 20 minutes. To increase efficiency, the dissociation can be performed at about 37° C. while shaking. The dissociation conditions can be adjusted according to the source or origin of the EBs. Following is a non-limiting description of dissociation of human EBs into cell aggregates. EBs can be formed from pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs or hESCs) in 10-cm tissue culture plate. Prior to dissociation, the EBs are collected in a 50 ml tube, centrifuged for 3 minutes at 800 rounds per minute (rpm), washed with 5 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged again. PBS is then removed and Collagenase B (0.5 ml from a stock of 1 mg/ml of Collagenase in F-12 DMEM medium) and Deoxyribonuclease I (at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml are added for an incubation time of about 20 minutes at 37° C. while periodically shaking the EBs. The Collagenase/DNAse reaction are stopped by addition of EBs medium +20% defined FBS (or serum replacement) to the cell aggregates, followed by gentle centrifugation (e.g., for 10 minutes at 1200 rpm). According to some embodiments of the invention, once the EBs are dissociated to cell aggregates these cell aggregates are further cultured in a culture medium so as to expand a population of adherent cells by at least about 2 folds, e.g., by at least 2.5 folds, about 3 folds, about 4 folds, about 5 folds. The culturing period desired for selection and expansion of the adherent cells is usually between 2-4 days (e.g., 2-3 days). According to some embodiments of the invention, culturing the cell aggregates is performed on low-adhesive (low-attachment) tissue culture plates (e.g., such as Greiner Bio-One Ltd. Brunel Way, Stroudwater Business ParkGL10 3SX StonehouseGreat Britain). In an exemplary embodiment, the plates are not gelatin-coated plates. According to some embodiments of the invention, culturing the cell aggregates is performed on non-coated plates (e.g., plates which are not coated by for example, gelatin). The culture medium which is used for culturing the cell aggregates can be any culture medium suitable for growing EBs. The medium can be supplemented with serum (e.g., human serum, bovine serum) or serum replacement and additional additives. For example, such a culture medium can be a basic culture medium [e.g., DMEM (an optimized Dulbeco's modified Eagle's medium for ES cells; Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.)] supplemented with serum or serum replacement [e.g., 20% Knockout® SR (Gibco-BRL)], glutamine (e.g., 1 mM glutamine), β-mercaptoethanol (e.g., 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol), and nonessential amino acids (e.g., 1% nonessential amino acids). Additionally or alternatively, the culture medium which is used for culturing the cell aggregates comprises ascorbic acid. As used herein “ascorbic acid” refers to the synthetic or naturally occurring ascorbic acid (an organic acid with antioxidant properties), also known as vitamin C, which is suitable for culturing cells (e.g., sterile preparation). The ascorbic acid which is included in the culture medium of the method of this aspect of the present invention can be obtained from Sigma (St Louis, Mo., USA) and is provided at a concentration of at least about 20 μg/ml, more preferably, at least about 30 μg/ml, preferably, at a concentration which is selected from the range of about 10-500 μg/ml, e.g., about 50-300 μg/ml, e.g., about 50-200 μg/ml, e.g., about 50-150 μg/ml, e.g., about 80-120 μg/ml, e.g., about 100 μg/ml. According to some embodiments of the invention, the culture medium which comprises ascorbic acid is devoid of dexamethasone. As used herein the phrase “devoid of dexamethasone” refers to a medium which includes less than about 1% of dexamethasone, e.g., less than 0.5%, less than about 0.1%, less than about 0.05%, less than about 0.01%, e.g., less than 0.005% of dexamethasone. The culture medium, which comprises ascorbic acid, can further include about 5-30% of serum or serum replacement (e.g., a xeno-free serum replacement), e.g., about 10-20% serum or serum replacement. In addition, the culture medium which comprises ascorbic acid may further include glutamine, non-essential amino acids, antibiotics, sodium Pyruvate and 2-mercaptoethanol. A non-limiting example of a culture medium which comprises ascorbic acid and which is suitable for culturing the cell aggregates include the BHK medium which consists of Glasgow Minimum Essential Medium (GMEM) with glutamine (GIBCO-Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and supplemented with 10% lot specific fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, Utah, USA), 1% penicillin (10,000 U/mL)-streptomycin (10 mg/mL) (Biological industries, Beit Haemek, Israel), 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA) ×100, 1 mM sodium Pyruvate, 0.75 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (all from GIBCO-Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and 100 μg/ml L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma, Rehovot, Israel). In exemplary embodiments the cell aggregates are first cultured for one day in an EBs-culture medium (devoid of ascorbic acid, e.g., an EB medium) and are then cultured in a culture medium which comprises ascorbic acid (e.g., the BHK medium) for additional 2-3 days. As described, the method of some embodiments of the invention comprises dissociating the expanded adherent cells into single cells (e.g., when each cell does not form contact with another cell in the same cell suspension). The dissociation is performed under conditions which enable separation of cell aggregates/clumps while preserving the viability of the separated cells of the dissociated EBs. For example, an enzyme such as Trypsin (e.g., at a concentration of 0.25%) can be used for 5-15 minutes at 37° C. The single cell suspensions can be further filtered through a Mesh (Cell strainer, 70 μm Nylon, BD Falcon, BD Biosciences, MA, USA) such that only single cells (and not cell clusters are isolated. As described above, once single cells are obtained they are further cultured for at least one passage in a culture medium which comprises ascorbic acid but being devoid of dexamethasone. Culturing of the single cells can be performed by seeding the single cells in a culture vessel (e.g., a two-dimensional or three-dimensional culture vessel) or into a matrix (e.g., a cell supporting scaffold, such as a nanofiber or a two-dimensional matrix) in the presence of a culture medium. When cultured on a two-dimensional culture system the single cells can be seeded at a concentration of about 2-200 cells/cm2, e.g., 1-100×105 cells/cm2, e.g., 50-100×105 cells/cm2, e.g., about 50×105 cells/cm2. Once cultured, the culture medium can be replaced every day or every other day. During culturing, the cells can be monitored for their morphology. A characteristic cell morphology is of “fibroblast-like cells”, e.g., flat, elongated cells with wide cytoplasm surrounding an elliptical, speckled nucleus, with abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum. It should be noted that during ongoing passaging the MPCs are big and flat, but during ECM generation the cells become smaller, condensed and generating several cell layers. It should be noted that the concentration of the cells can be determined by counting a sample of the cells, using any known method, such as Triphan-blue. When the cells exhibit subconfluency (e.g., about 80-90% confluency), the cultured cells are passaged. Passaging can be performed by dissociating cells from the wall of the culture vessel using e.g., type IV Collagenase [e.g., at a concentration of 0.1% (gram per 100 ml PBS solution) for 20-60 minutes] followed by trypsinization (using e.g., 0.1% trypsin-EDTA for 5-10 minutes), counting the single cells and splitting the cells to 2-3 culture vessels. According to some embodiments of the invention, the first passaging occurs after 2-10 days of the initial seeding, e.g., 2-8 days, 2-6 days, 2-4 days of the initial seeding. According to some embodiments of the invention, the cell culture is subjected to culture passaging every 4-8 days, e.g., culture passaging occurs every 3-8 days, e.g., every 4 days. Culturing can be performed for several passages, e.g., from 1-15 passages, e.g., 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-9, 1-10, 1-11, 1-12, 1-13, 1-14 or 1-15 passages, or until senescence. As used herein the term “senescence” refers to the stage in which the cells lose their ability to divide, or significantly reduce their growth rate. Thus, using the method of some embodiments of the invention a novel population of mesenchymal progenitor cells can be isolated. Thus, according to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention, there is provided an isolated population of cells comprising at least about 60%, e.g., about 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, e.g., 100% mesenchymal progenitor cells, wherein differentiation into an adipogenic lineage of the mesenchymal progenitor cells is reduced by at least about 50%, e.g., by about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 71%, about 72%, about 73%, about 74%, about 75%, about 76%, about 77%, about 78%, about 79%, about 80%, about 81%, about 82%, about 83%, about 84%, about 85%, about 86%, about 87%, about 88%, about 89%, about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, e.g., at least about 99%, e.g., 100% as compared to differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells selected from an adult adipogenic tissue under identical assay conditions. Quantization of the degree of differentiation into an adipogenic lineage can be performed by various methods (e.g., assays). For example, the number of fat drops per cells in the culture can be measured using for example, an image analysis system (e.g., ImagePro software). Additionally or alternatively, the differentiation to adipogenic lineage can be determined by quantitative Real Time PCR using adipogenic differentiation markers as: Peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-γ [PPAR γ; using e.g., primers specific to GenBank Accession Nos. NM—005037.5 (SEQ ID NO:55), NM—015869.4 (SEQ ID NO:56), NM—138711.3 (SEQ ID NO:57) and/or NM—138712.3 (SEQ ID NO:58)], CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins beta [C/EBPβ; using e.g., primers specific to GenBank Accession NO. NM—005194.2 (SEQ ID NO:59)], Leptin [using e.g., primers specific to GenBank Accession NO. NM—000230.2 (SEQ ID NO:54)] and adiponectin [using e.g., primers specific to GenBank Accession NO. NM—001177800.1 (SEQ ID NO:53) and/or NM—004797.3 (SEQ ID NO:60)]. As shown in FIGS. 4A-J and described in Example 3 of the Examples section which follows, the MPCs of some embodiments of the invention exhibit increased calcific deposition as determined by Alizarin Red staining, indicative of the increased osteogenic differentiation potential. According to some embodiments of the invention, the isolated population of mesenchymal progenitor cells are characterized by increased osteogenic differentiation potential as compared to the osteogenic differentiation potential of adipose-derived MSCs under identical assays conditions. According to some embodiments of the invention, the isolated population of cells is characterized by at least 20% higher calcific deposition as compared to the calcific deposition by adipose-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells under identical assay conditions, e.g., at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, e.g., about 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, e.g., 100%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900% or 1000% higher calcific deposition as compared to the calcific deposition observed from adipose-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells under identical assay conditions. Quantification of the calcific deposition can be determined by various methods, such as by Alizarin Red staining. According to some embodiments of the invention, the isolated population of cells comprises at least about 60%, e.g., about 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, e.g., 100% of mesenchymal progenitor cells which express CD105 (i.e., exhibit a CD105+ expression pattern). According to some embodiments of the invention, the isolated population of cells comprises between 80-100% CD105 positive cells. As used herein the phrases “express” or “not express” refer to cells having a positive (+) or negative (−) expression profile, respectively, of a certain marker (e.g., gene or gene product). CD105, also known as endoglin (gene symbol ENG) is a homodimeric transmembrane protein, a major glycoprotein of the vascular endothelium. Endoglin is a component of the transforming growth factor beta receptor complex and it binds TGFB1 and TGFB3 with high affinity. There are two known variants of endoglin: isoform 1 (GenBank Accession No. NP—001108225.1; SEQ ID NO:61) and isoform 2 (GenBank Accession No. NP—000109.1; SEQ ID NO:62). According to some embodiments of the invention, detection of CD105 expression can be performed using an anti CD105 antibody. Suitable CD105 antibodies which can be used to detect CD105 on the cells include R-Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-CD105 (eBioscience), Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD105 (ABCAM), APC-conjugated anti-CD105 (eBioscience). According to some embodiments of the invention, the isolated population of cells comprises at least about 60%, e.g., about 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, e.g., 100% of mesenchymal progenitor cells which express CD90 (i.e., exhibit a CD90+ expression pattern). CD90 (Cluster of Differentiation 90), also known as Thy-1 cell surface antigen (THY1) is a 25-37 kDa heavily N-glycosylated, glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored conserved cell surface protein with a single V-like immunoglobulin domain, originally discovered as a thymocyte antigen. A non-limiting example of a suitable CD90 antibodies which can be used to detect the CD90 surface marker on cells include, the mouse anti CD90 PE conjugated (Biolegend). According to some embodiments of the invention, the isolated population of cells comprises at least about 60%, e.g., about 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, e.g., 100% of mesenchymal progenitor cells which are characterized by a CD105+/CD90+/CD73+/CD44+/CD29+ expression signature (i.e., express the CD105/CD90/CD73/CD44/CD29 cell surface markers). According to some embodiments of the invention, the isolated population of cells comprises at least about 60%, e.g., about 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, e.g., 100% of mesenchymal progenitor cells which are characterized by a CD45−/CD34− signature (i.e., do not express the CD45 and CD34 cell surface markers). According to some embodiments of the invention, the mesenchymal progenitor cells are capable of forming extracellular matrix. According to some embodiments of the invention, the isolated population of mesenchymal progenitor cells maintain the ability to form extracellular matrix for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 passages, e.g., between 1-15 passages. According to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention there is provided a method of isolating an extracellular matrix, comprising: (a) culturing the mesenchymal progenitor cells of some embodiments of the invention under conditions which induce production of extracellular matrix from the mesenchymal progenitor cells, (b) isolating the extracellular matrix produced by the mesenchymal progenitor cells, thereby isolating the extracellular matrix. As used herein the phrase “extracellular matrix (ECM)” refers to a material produced and secreted by living cells which provides structural support for cells cultured therein. In a mammalian tissue the ECM is deposited outside of the cells into the interstitial matrix and the basement membrane. Generally, the ECM includes fibrous elements (particularly collagen, elastin, or reticulin), cell adhesion polypeptides (e.g., fibronectin, laminin and adhesive glycoproteins), and space-filling molecules [usually glycosaminoglycans (GAG), proteoglycans]. Other substantial components are growth factors and cytokines, which are present within the ECM in very small quantities but play a critical role as potent modulators of cell behavior. According to some embodiments of the invention, the ECM produced and secreted by the cells is capable of carrying (e.g., supporting) cells or cell components. Culturing the mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) can be performed on any culture vessel (e.g., a two-dimensional culture plate, or a three-dimensional culture vessel), with or without additional substrate or scaffold to which the cells may attach. Thus, the MPCs can be cultured on a low-adhesive tissue culture plate and the ECM can be deposited in layers on the surface of the culture plate. Additionally or alternatively, the MPCs can be cultured on a scaffold, to thereby form a three-dimensional ECM structure. According to some embodiments of the invention, the substrate or scaffold on which the MPCs are cultured is an electrospun element. According to some embodiments of the invention, the culturing is performed on an electrospun element. It should be noted that as in any culturing method, the cells are cultured on the electrospun element (e.g., nanofibers) in the presence of a suitable culture medium, such as a medium which comprises ascorbic acid (e.g., the BHK medium). The concentration of MPCs seeded on the nanofibers can be selected from about 0.5-1.5×105 cells/cm2. According to some embodiments of the invention, the medium used for culturing the MPCs is devoid of dexamethasone and/or Glycerol 2-phosphate in order to prevent formation of a mineralized ECM. Manufacturing of electrospun elements can be done by an electrospinning process which is well known in the art. Following is a non-limiting description of an to electrospinning process. One or more liquefied polymers (i.e., a polymer in a liquid form such as a melted or dissolved polymer) are dispensed from a dispenser within an electrostatic field in a direction of a rotating collector. The dispenser can be, for example, a syringe with a metal needle or a bath provided with one or more capillary apertures from which the liquefied polymer(s) can be extruded, e.g., under the action of hydrostatic pressure, mechanical pressure, air pressure and high voltage. The rotating collector (e.g., a drum) serves for collecting the electrospun element thereupon. Typically, but not obligatorily, the collector has a cylindrical shape. The dispenser (e.g., a syringe with metallic needle) is typically connected to a source of high voltage, preferably of positive polarity, while the collector is grounded, thus forming an electrostatic field between the dispenser and the collector. Alternatively, the dispenser can be grounded while the collector is connected to a source of high voltage, preferably with negative polarity. As will be appreciated by one ordinarily skilled in the art, any of the above configurations establishes motion of positively charged jet from the dispenser to the collector. Inverse electrostatic configurations for establishing motions of negatively charged jet from the dispenser to the collector are also contemplated. At a critical voltage, the charge repulsion begins to overcome the surface tension of the liquid drop. The charged jets depart from the dispenser and travel within the electrostatic field towards the collector. Moving with high velocity in the inter-electrode space, the jet stretches and solvent therein evaporates, thus forming fibers which are collected on the collector, thus forming the electrospun element. As used herein, the phrase “electrospun element” refers to an element of any shape including, without limitation, a planar shape and a tubular shape, made of one or more non-woven polymer fiber(s), produced by a process of electrospinning. When the electrospun element is made of a single fiber, the fiber is folded thereupon, hence can be viewed as a plurality of connected fibers. It is to be understood that a more detailed reference to a plurality of fibers is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention to such particular case. Thus, unless otherwise defined, any reference herein to a “plurality of fibers” applies also to a single fiber and vice versa. The electrospun element is also referred to as a nanofiber hereinafter. The polymer fibers of the electrospun element can be arranged on a single layer, but, more preferably, the fibers define a plurality of layers hence form a three dimensional structure. The polymer fibers may have a general random orientation, or a preferred orientation, as desired e.g., when the fibers are collected on a cylindrical collector such as a drum, the polymer fibers can be aligned predominantly axially or predominantly circumferentially. Different layers of the electrospun element may have different orientation characteristics. For example, without limiting the scope of some embodiments of the invention to any specific ordering or number of layers, the fibers of a first layer may have a first predominant orientation, the fibers of a second layer may have a second predominant orientation, and the fibers of third layer may have general random orientation. Various parameters involved in the electrospinning process may vary during the process in a continuous or non-continuous manner. These include, but not limited to: the velocity of the rotating collector, the characteristic of the electrostatic field vector (magnitude and/or direction), the size or shape of the capillary apertures of the dispenser (e.g., the size and/or cross-sectional shape of a needle attached to the dispenser), the dispensing flow rate of the at least one liquefied polymer the viscosity and/or concentration of the liquefied polymer and the concentration of charge control agent. The characteristic of the electrostatic field vector can be varied during the electrospinning process in more than one way. In one preferred embodiment, the variation of the electric field is effected by varying, preferably continuously, the distance between the dispenser and the collector; in another preferred embodiment, the variation of the electric field is effected by varying, preferably continuously, the potential difference between the dispenser and the collector; in an additional embodiment, the variation of the electrostatic field is effected by varying both the distance and the potential difference in a substantially continues manner. The polymer used in the electrospinning process for the manufacture of the electrospun element can be a natural, synthetic and/or biocompatible polymer. The phrase “synthetic polymer” refers to polymers that are not found in nature, even if the polymers are made from naturally occurring biomaterials. Examples include, but are not limited to, aliphatic polyesters, poly(amino acids), copoly(ether-esters), polyalkylenes oxalates, polyamides, tyrosine derived polycarbonates, poly(iminocarbonates), polyorthoesters, polyoxaesters, polyamidoesters, polyoxaesters containing amine groups, poly(anhydrides), polyphosphazenes, and combinations thereof. Suitable synthetic polymers for use in the present invention can also include biosynthetic polymers based on sequences found in collagen, elastin, thrombin, fibronectin, starches, poly(amino acid), poly(propylene fumarate), gelatin, alginate, pectin, fibrin, oxidized cellulose, chitin, chitosan, tropoelastin, hyaluronic acid, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, poly(tetrafluoroethylene), polycarbonate, polypropylene and poly(vinyl alcohol), ribonucleic acids, deoxyribonucleic acids, polypeptides, proteins, polysaccharides, polynucleotides and combinations thereof. The phrase “natural polymer” refers to polymers that are naturally occurring. Non-limiting examples of such polymers include, silk, collagen-based materials, chitosan, hyaluronic acid, alginate and albumin. As used herein, the phrase “co-polymer” refers to a polymer of at least two chemically distinct monomers. Non-limiting examples of co-polymers include, PLA-PEG, PEGT/PBT, PLA-PGA PEG-PCL and PCL-PLA. The phrase “biocompatible polymer” refers to any polymer (synthetic or natural) which when in contact with cells, tissues or body fluid of an organism does not induce adverse effects such as immunological reactions and/or rejections and the like. It will be appreciated that a biocompatible polymer can also be a biodegradable polymer. The phrase “biodegradable polymer” refers to a synthetic or natural polymer which can be degraded (i.e., broken down) in the physiological environment such as by proteases. Biodegradability depends on the availability of degradation substrates (i.e., biological materials or portion thereof which are part of the polymer), the presence of biodegrading materials (e.g., microorganisms, enzymes, proteins) and the availability of oxygen (for aerobic organisms, microorganisms or portions thereof), carbon dioxide (for anaerobic organisms, microorganisms or portions thereof) and/or other nutrients. Degradable polyesters are one of the widely used synthetic materials for electrospinning because they are biodegradable with metabolizable degradation products. The degradation rate of polyester can be controlled by changing the constitute of the polymer. Examples of biodegradable polymers include, but are not limited to, collagen, fibrin, hyaluronic acid, polylactic acid (PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), polycaprolactone (PCL), polydioxanone (PDO), trimethylene carbonate (TMC), calcium sulfate, polyethyleneglycol (PEG), Collagen, PEG-DMA, Alginate, Hydroxyapatite, chitosan, and/or copolymers thereof and/or mixtures thereof. For example, PLGA—Poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid is the copolymer of both PGA and PLA, being the most popular synthetic polymer for tissue engineering applications because of its excellent biocompatibility and variable degradability obtained by controlled the ratio of PGA:PLA within the copolymer. PCL is a crystalline, biodegradable polymer, which is easily fabricated, and when electrospun exhibits good mechanical properties. According to some embodiments of the invention, the electrospun element comprises polycaprolactone (PCL). According to some embodiments of the invention, the electrospun element comprises polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and/or combination thereof (e.g. PCL/PLGA 1:6). According to some embodiments of the invention, the liquefied polymer can be made of one polymer or more, each can be a polymer or a co-polymer such as described hereinabove. According to some embodiments of the invention, the liquefied polymer is a mixture of at least one biocompatible polymer and a co-polymer (either biodegradable or non-biodegradable). Thus, the cultured MPCs produce ECM on the culture vessel or the substrate (e.g., the electrospun element) which can be further isolated. The term “isolated” as used herein refers to at least partially separated from the natural environment e.g., the cells producing the ECM. According to some embodiments of the invention, the isolated ECM is at least partially separated from the culture vessel used for growing the cells. According to some embodiments of the invention, the ECM comprises proteins such as collagens (various types as collagen I, collagen III, IV, V, VI), actin, Vimentin, fibronectin and laminin, desmin, Glucoseaminoglycans (GAGs). According to some embodiments of the invention, the ECM is a non-mineralized ECM. As used herein the phrase “non-mineralized” ECM refers to an ECM which is substantially devoid of calcium deposits. According to some embodiments of the invention, the ECM comprises no more than 10% (weight/weight) of calcium deposits, e.g., no more than about 9%, nor more than about 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1% of calcium, e.g., 0% calcium deposits. In order to make the produced ECM amendable for tissue regeneration or repair applications, the ECM should be devoid of cellular components. According to some embodiments of the invention, the method further comprising decellularizing the extracellular matrix. As used herein the phrase “decellularizing the ECM” refers to removal of cells from the ECM. According to some embodiments of the invention, the isolated ECM is decellularized. According to some embodiments of the invention, the isolated ECM is devoid of any cellular components (i.e., an acellular ECM). The phrase “devoid of any cellular components” as used herein refers to being more than about 80%, e.g., more than 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, e.g., 100% devoid of the cellular components present in the cell culture which comprises the ECM prior to the decellularization process. As used herein, the phrase “cellular components” refers to cell membrane components or intracellular components which make up the cell. Examples of cell components include cell structures (e.g., organelles) or molecules comprised in same. Examples of such include, but are not limited to, cell nuclei, nucleic acids, residual nucleic acids (e.g., fragmented nucleic acid sequences), cell membranes and/or residual cell membranes (e.g., fragmented membranes) which are present in cells of the tissue. It will be appreciated that due to the removal of all cellular components from the cell culture which comprises the ECM, the decellularized ECM cannot induce an immunological response when implanted in a recipient subject, e.g., a recipient to which the cells or cell components are xenogenic or allogenic. Decellularization of the ECM can be done by various methods known in the art. For example, acellularization can be performed by combination of physical treatment—lyophilization, freeze and thaw cycling and DNase treatment, essentially as described in Ngangan A V and McDevitt T C [2009, Biomaterials 30:1143-1149 which is fully incorporated herein by reference in its entirety]; acellularization can be performed by Peracetic acid, Sodium dodecyl sulfate, Tritonx100 and DNase essentially as described in Nair R. et al. [2008, J. Biomater. Sci. Polymer Edn. 19: 801-819, which is fully incorporated herein by reference in its entirety]; acellularization can be performed by treatment with distilled water (e.g., Aqua dest) for 24 hours, 1% SDS for 24 hours, distilled water for 24 hours and 70% Ethanol for 24 hours, followed by washes with PBS, essentially as described in Tischer T. et al. [2007, Arch Orthop Trauma Surg. 127:735-741, which is fully incorporated herein by reference in its entirety]; acellularization can be performed by washes in hypertonic 1.1% NaCl-0.02% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) for 2 hours and then in hypotonic 0.7% NaCl-0.02% EDTA for 2 hours, followed by two 24 hours cycles of enzymatic digestion using 0.05% trypsin (Sigma)-0.02% EDTA in PBS at pH 7.4 and at 37° C., supplemented with Pen-Strep and Fungizone, followed by wash(es) in detergent solution of 1% Triton-X-100 (polyethylene octylphenyl ether) and 0.1% ammonium hydroxide in PBS for four consecutive 48 hours cycles, and extensive washes in sterile saline, immersion in 70% ethanol overnight, and washes in sterile water, and lyophilization, essentially as described in Eitan Y. et al. [2010, Tissue engineering part C Methods. 16(4):671-83] which is fully incorporated herein by reference in its entirety]; acellularization can be performed by combination of physical and chemical treatments as—sonication, agitation, freezing and thawing, and then several detergent washes, essentially as described in Badylak S F et al. 2009 [ActaBiomaterialia, 5: 1-13, which is fully incorporated herein by reference in its entirety]. It should be noted that when the ECM is deposited on a substrate such as a scaffold made of an electrospun element, the decellularization process is performed such that the cellular components are removed while the ECM deposited on the scaffold is unharmed, and exhibits the same structure and mechanical properties as the ECM prior to the decellularization process. Following is a non-limiting description of an acellularization protocol which can be used to decellularize the ECM of some embodiments of the invention. The ECM is subject to treatment with a hypertonic solution (e.g., 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA). The duration of incubation in the hypertonic solution can be from a few minutes, to hours and days. According to some embodiments of the invention, the ECM is treated with the hypertonic solution during an overnight incubation with gentle agitation. The treatment is then followed by one or more washes in a neutral buffer such as PBS, each wash can be done for a few minutes up to several hours. The ECM is then treated by Triton X-100 (e.g., about 1% Triton X-100) for a time period which varies between few minutes to several hours. According to some embodiments of the invention, the ECM is treated with the Triton X-100 solution for 1-2 hours at room temperature, with gentle agitation. Following treatment with Triton, the ECM can be washed with PBS, e.g., 2 washes in PBS, each wash for 5 minutes, following which the ECM is subject to DNAase treatment (using e.g., DNAse 1, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml for 1 hour at 37° C.). For therapeutic applications, the ECM is generated and isolated (via acellularization) under sterile conditions (i.e., free of living organisms such as bacteria and yeast). In addition, the ECM can be subject to lyophilization under sterile conditions, and optionally can be subject to sterilization using ultra violet (UV) radiation, plasma treatment or both. Thus, the isolated ECM of some embodiments of the invention has a medical grade purity (i.e., safe for administration), and in some embodiments of the invention even an implant grade purity (i.e., safe for implantation). The isolated ECM of some embodiments of the invention can be kept as an “off the shelf” product for a long period of time, which is practically eternal. Thus, according to some embodiments of the invention, there is provided an isolated extracellular matrix produced according to the method of some embodiments of the invention. According to some embodiments of the invention, the isolated ECM forms part of a device (e.g., scaffold such as an electrospun element). According to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention, there is provided a hybrid device comprising an electrospun element and the isolated extracellular matrix of some embodiments of the invention. According to some embodiments of the invention, the ECM is deposited on the electrospun element and covers internal layers thereof (e.g., all layers of the electrospun element). According to some embodiments of the invention, the hybrid device further comprising a supportive mesh, e.g., a synthetic mesh or net. The supportive mesh of some embodiments of the invention may generally serve to provide strength and structural integrity to the biological tissue during its use in medical applications, thus serving as a reinforcement material. The reinforcement material may typically support the biological tissue and the surrounding tissue in general during wound repair and tissue closure. According to some embodiments of the invention, the supportive mesh comprises a non-biodegradable material. As used herein the phrase “non-biodegradable material” refers to a substance (e.g., metal, polymer) which is essentially stable i.e., non-degradable in the physiological environment of a subject (e.g., within a human body, e.g., within tissues or body fluids of the subject). According to a specific embodiment, the material maintains at least about 90%, e.g., about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, 100% of its structure, function and dimension over a period of several years (e.g., at least 1-2 years) or over a life time in the body or tissue. According to some embodiments of the invention, the non-biodegradable material is non-absorbable by the subject's body. According to some embodiments of the invention, the supportive mesh is biocompatible. Selection of the supportive mesh may take into consideration the pore size, strength, permeability and flexibility of the material, as well as the structure and function of the surrounding tissue. For example, for use in applications involving load-bearing tissue, the supportive mesh may provide the appropriate tensile strength and flexibility to support the biological material and surrounding tissue during the formation of new tissue sufficient to support surrounding tissue. One of ordinary skill in the art can recognize the desired characteristics of the supportive mesh in selecting the optimal material. The supportive mesh may comprise a material selected from the group consisting of polypropylene mesh such as Prolene™ (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, N.J.) and Marlex™ (C. R. Bard Inc.); polyester such as Dacron™ and Mersilene™ (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, N.J.); silicone, polyethylene, polyamide, titanium, stainless steel, polymethylmethacrylate, nylon, silk, cotton; polyglactic acid such as Vicryl™ mesh (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, N.J.), polyglycolic acid such as Dexon™ mesh; poliglecaprone, polydioxone and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene such as DualMesh™, Mycromesh™, or other expanded PTFE (W. L. Gore and Associates); PDS®, Vicryl®, or Monocryl®. In some embodiments, the supportive mesh may be multifilament polyester strands or monofilament polyester strands. Supportive meshes can be purchased from any commercial source and manipulated into the desired shape or form using techniques known in the art. For example, in forming the shape of a mesh, the supportive mesh can be an over- and under-weave that is heat tacked at each junction point. In some embodiments of the invention, the supportive mesh may undergo a crosslinking treatment to alter the mechanical properties of the material. For example, the supportive mesh may undergo crosslinking treatment to increase the strength of the material for medical applications in load-bearing tissue. The supportive mesh may be of any shape or size according to its application as a support to the biological material in medical applications. Selection of the appropriate shape or size of the supportive mesh is routine for one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the supportive mesh may be in the form of fibers organized as a mesh or lattice. In some embodiments, the mesh may be comprised of a web, wherein the web is defined by a plurality of spaced apertures. The mesh or lattice can have various designs such as polygons (triangles, rectangles, etc.), circles, ovals, spirals, or any combination thereof. The spaces between the fibers of the mesh can vary according to the size of the mesh and the medical application (e.g., for implantation in a load-bearing tissue), but are preferably between about 0.1 cm and about 2.0 cm. According to some embodiments of the invention, the supportive mesh may be treated with an anti-infective agent. Non-limiting examples of anti-infective agents include, but are not limited to, anti-inflammatory agents, analgesic agents, local anesthetic agents, antispasmodic agents, or combinations thereof. The addition of suitable anti-infective compounds to the surface of the mesh on the strands and junction points attack may inhibit the growth and proliferation of bacteria on and/or near the implant. According to some embodiments of the invention, the supportive mesh may be treated with a protease inhibitor in order to alter its degradation rate. Non-limiting examples of protease inhibitors which can be used along with the invention include, but are not limited to, Aminoethylbenzenesulfonyl fluoride HCL, Aprotinin, Protease Inhibitor E-64, Leupeptin, Hemisulfate, EDTA, Disodium (0.025-0.10 um) or trypsin-like proteases, Pepstatin A (Aspartic Proteases), Mannistat (MMP2), or any combination thereof. The above described treatments may be applied by methods known in the art, including, but not limited to, bathing, injecting, transfecting, bonding, coating, adding genetically modified cells and/or genetic material itself, or laminating. The supportive mesh can be for example, the Prolift™ net available from to Ethicon, Sommerville, N.J., USA. The isolated ECM or the hybrid device comprising same of some embodiments of the invention is characterized by bioactivity, biocompatibility and safety for surgical tissue reconstruction applications. As used herein the phrase “bioactivity” refers to the ability to stimulate host cell restoration and tissue remodeling. A good bioactivity can be evaluated by the ability to induce host tissue integration and ability of biodegradation or absorption when replaced by the host tissue. According to some embodiments of the invention, the biocompatibility of the isolated ECM or the hybrid device comprising same is such that following implantation in a subject the ECM or the device is not rejected or extruded, and/or does not cause long term inflammation, contamination, and/or disease transmission. The isolated ECM or the hybrid device comprising same of some embodiments of the invention is homogenous, and uniform, with minimal batch to batch variations. The isolated ECM or the hybrid device comprising same of some embodiments of the invention is highly available since can be generated by a robust technology using pluripotent stem cells. As described above and further shown in the Examples section which follows, the present inventors used the decellularized ECM for implantation into mice and rats and showed that the isolated ECM is superior in its biocompatibility characteristics and the ability to induce tissue regeneration over commercially available supportive meshes (e.g., synthetic meshes) which were used as controls. Thus, as shown in FIGS. 10A-H, while the synthetic meshes were rejected by the implanted mice and rats and failed to close the incision, the nanofiber ECM implant, which was generated according to the method of some embodiments of the invention, was capable of successfully closing and healing the wound, while inducing a regenerated tissue. Thus, according to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention, there is provided a method of inducing soft tissue regeneration or repair, the method is effected by implanting the isolated extracellular matrix of some embodiments of the invention or the hybrid device comprising same of some embodiments of the invention into a diseased or injured tissue of a subject, thereby inducing the soft tissue regeneration or repair. According to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention, there is to provided a method of inducing soft tissue regeneration or repair. The method is effected by: (a) isolating an extracellular matrix according to the method of some embodiments of the invention, (b) decellularizing the extracellular matrix, and (c) implanting the extracellular matrix resultant of step (b) into a diseased or injured tissue of a subject, thereby inducing the soft tissue regeneration or repair. According to some embodiments of the invention, the ECM is generated by culturing the MPCs of some embodiments of the invention on an electrospun element such that the extracellular matrix is deposited on the electrospun element. According to some embodiments of the invention, the decellularization is performed on a device (e.g., a hybrid device) which comprises the electrospun element and the ECM deposited thereon (forming e.g., an acellular hybrid device). As used herein the phrase “soft tissue” refers to a tissue that connects, supports, or surrounds other structures and organs of the body, not being a mineralized tissue as bone or tooth. Examples of soft tissues include, but are not limited to tendons, ligaments, fascia, skin, fibrous tissues, fat, synovial membranes (connective tissue), muscles, nerves and blood vessels. As used herein the phrase “inducing soft tissue regeneration or repair” refers to initiating and/or improving the rate, degree and/or quality of a biological process of tissue regeneration or repair (including reconstruction of tissue). According to some embodiments of the invention, the hybrid device ECM is used to reconstruct a tissue, by providing a mechanical strength while avoiding rejection by the recipient subject. In cases of reconstruction surgeries, the repair of tissue can be evaluated by degree of compatibility of the graft by the host tissue, the generation of fibrous capsule around the foreign implant and the presence or absence of rejection of the implant. As used herein the phrase “improving a biological process of tissue regeneration or repair” refers to improving the rate, degree and/or quality of a biological process of tissue regeneration or repair of tissue regeneration by at least about 2%, at least about 3%, at least about 4%, at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 99%, e.g., 100%, at least about 2 times, at least about 3-10 times, at least about 20, 30, 40, 50, 60-100, 200, 300, 400, 500-1000 times as compared to a tissue which is not being treated by the isolated ECM or the hybrid device comprising same of some embodiments of the invention, or as compared to a tissue treated under the same (e.g., identical) conditions by implanting a supportive mesh (e.g., a synthetic mesh) which is devoid of extracellular matrix. Methods of implanting grafts such as the isolated ECM or the hybrid device comprising same of some embodiments the invention into a subject are known in the art. For example, the isolated ECM or the hybrid device can be implanted subcutaneously, intradermally, into any body cavity (e.g., abdomen), into a wounded tissue, into an incision, and/or injected as a filler and as such can be used in many reconstructive surgeries in order to treat a subject in need of soft tissue regeneration or repair. The term “treating” refers to inhibiting, preventing or arresting the development of a pathology (disease, disorder or condition) and/or causing the reduction, remission, or regression of a pathology. Those of skill in the art will understand that various methodologies and assays can be used to assess the development of a pathology, and similarly, various methodologies and assays may be used to assess the reduction, remission or regression of a pathology. As used herein, the term “subject” includes mammals, preferably human beings at any age which suffer from the pathology. Following is a non-limiting list of pathologies which can be treated by implanting the isolated ECM of some embodiments of the invention: abdominal ventral hernia, pelvic floor defect (PFD), pelvic organ prolapse, stress urinary incontinence (a common disorder among women), and other pathologies which require replacement or reconstruction of various tissues. Following is a non-limiting list of uses of the isolated ECM or the device comprising same of some embodiments of the invention: surgical products such as vascular and arterial graft, valve and aorta replacement, lower urinary tract reconstruction, skin substitute or reconstruction, use as myocardial patch and heart valve substitute, venous graft reconstruction, various orthopedic applications as tendon and ligaments replacement, tendon and ligament reconstruction, use as a drug release device, use as a dermal filler(s), probably as a gel generated from the acellular hybrid device, use as a biosynthetic prosthesis for the repair of ventral abdominal hernia and pelvic organ prolapse, use of the hybrid device for coating an available synthetic mesh (such a product can restore the physical properties of the prosthesis and the mechanical support to the defected anatomical site, triggering minimal adverse events), slings for the repair of stress urinary incontinence, use as dermal filers, e.g., as a hydrogel generated from the acellular NFL-ECM device (Badylak S F. 2004; Xenogeneic extracellular matrix as a scaffold for tissue reconstruction. Trans Immunol. 12: 367-377), or the ECM alone dissolve in a hydrogel. The most common treatment for stress urinary incontinence is the use of suburethral synthetic slings, which demonstrate a relatively high rate of extrusion of the repair material and infection at the surgery site. The hybrid device of some embodiments of the invention can reduce these side effects. According to an aspect of some embodiments of the invention, there is provided a hydrogel comprising the isolated ECM of some embodiments of the invention and/or the hybrid device of the some embodiments of the invention.

All the information contained therein is incorporated herein by reference. General Materials and Experimental Methods Materials: BHK Medium consists of a Glasgow Minimum Essential Medium (GMEM) with glutamine (GIBCO-Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and supplemented with 10% lot specific fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, Utah, USA), 1% penicillin (10,000 U/mL)-streptomycin (10 mg/mL) (Biological industries, Beit Haemek, Israel), 1% non-essential amino acids (NEAA) ×100, 1 mM sodium Pyruvate, 0.75 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (all from GIBCO-Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and 100 μg/ml L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma, Rehovot, Israel). EBs Medium— 80% F12 DMEM (an optimized Dulbeco's modified Eagle's medium for ES cells; Gibco-BRL, Gaithersburg, Md.), 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Utah, USA), 1 mM glutamine (Gibco-BRL), 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), and 1% nonessential amino acids stock (Gibco-BRL). Derivation of Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells (MPCs) from hESCs and iPSCs Via the Formation of Embryoid Bodies (EBs)— hESCs or hiPSCs were cultured routinely. Embryoid bodies (EBs) differentiation was performed as previously described (Itskovitz-Eldor et al. 2000, Molecular Medicine 6: 88-95). For EB's dissociation, the EBs, which were generated in 10-cm tissue culture plate, were collected in a 50 ml tube, centrifuged for 3 minutes at 800 rounds per minute (rpm), washed with 5 ml PBS and centrifuged again. PBS was removed and 0.5 ml collagenase B (1 mg/ml)+Deoxyribonuclease I (final concentration 2 mg/ml) and incubated for 20 minutes at 37° C., during which the cells were mixed periodically. To stop Collagenase reaction, EBs medium (which includes serum) was added and the cells were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1200 rpm. Cells (which were in aggregates containing about 10-30 cells/aggregate) were resuspended with EBs medium overnight. Then the medium was switched to BHK medium for further culturing of about 2-3 days. After this period the cells were recollected and dissociated by 0.1% Trypsin for 5-10 minutes at 37° C. Single cells suspension was filtered through Mesh such that only single cells (and not cell clusters) were isolated and further centrifuged. Cells were resuspended with 2 ml BHK medium and counted using Triphan-blue. Cells were seeded at concentration of 5×105 cells/cm2 and cultured with BHK medium, the cultured cells are considered MPCs at passage 2-3 when they show homogenous morphology of mesenchymal cells. MPCs were routinely passages every 3-4 days up to passages 12-15. Generation of Extracellular Matrix (ECM) from MPCs— For ECM generation, MPCs were cultured for 3-4 weeks in the presence of BHK medium, with no subsequent passaging, such that high density cell cultures are cultured for a long time. Adipose Derived (AD) MSC Isolation— AD MSCs were Obtained from Raw human abdomen or thigh lipoaspirates. Lipoaspirates were washed extensively with sterile phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) to remove contaminating debris. Washed aspirates were treated with 1% collagenase type I (Sigma, Rehovot, Israel) in PBS for 1 hour at 37° C. with agitation. The collagenase was inactivated with an equal volume of DMEM/10% FBS/1 mM Glutamine/1% PenStrep/0.2 mg/ml Kanamycin and then was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2000 rpm. The cellular pellet was resuspended in 160 mM Ammonium Chloride, incubated in room temperature for 10 minutes to remove red blood cells, neutralized with an equal volume of the BHK medium and filtered through a 100 mm mesh filter to remove large fat tissue debris. The filtrate was centrifuged as detailed above and plated onto conventional tissue culture flasks in BHK medium. RT-PCR— Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen, UK), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and cDNA was obtained by reverse transcribing 1 μg (microgram) of total RNA with 200 units of M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, USA), using random primers (Promega, USA). PCR conditions were optimized for each set of primers and the number of PCR cycles was confirmed to be in the linear range of amplification. The amplified products were separated on a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under a UV light.

Induction of Multi-Lineage Differentiation of MSCs and MPCs Culture Media— Cells were cultured in a BHK medium which is described hereinabove. Osteogenic Differentiation— 2×105 cells per well were seeded on a 6-well plate or 5×104 cells per well on a 24-well plate in BHK medium which was used as the control medium throughout the experiment. On the following day, the cells were induced to differentiate into osteoblasts by enriching BHK medium with 10 mM β-glycerophosphate and 10−7 M dexamethasone (both from Sigma, Rehovot, Israel). The cells were cultured with this osteogenic medium for 28-30 days, without culture passaging, during which the medium was changed twice a week. Staining with Alizarine Red— Following 28 days the cells were fixed and stained with Alizarin Red. Alizarin Red is used to identify calcium in tissue sections. Calcium forms an Alizarin Red S-calcium complex in a chelation process, and the end product is birefringent. Adipogenic Differentiation— 2×105 cells per well were seeded on a 6-well plate or 5×104 cells per well on a 24-well plate. On the following day, the cells were fed with “Basic medium” composed of (DMEM)/F-12 supplemented with 1% penicillin (10,000 U/mL)-streptomycin (10 mg/mL), 1 mM glutamine (all from biological industries, Beit Haemek, Israel) and 10% lot specific FBS (Hyclone, Logan, Utah, USA). For adipogenesis induction the “basic medium” was enriched with 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 mM 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 10−6 M dexamethasone and 100×10−6 M indomethacin (all from Sigma, Rehovot, Israel). The cells were cultured with this adipogenic medium for 28-30 days, without culture passaging, during which the medium was changed twice a week. Chondrogenic Differentiation— 2×105 cells were centrifuged at 300 g for 5 minutes in 15 ml polypropylene falcon tubes to form a cell pellet. The cells were grown for 6 weeks in DMEM medium supplemented with 10−7 M dexamethasone 1% ITS (Insulin-Transferin-Selenium, Catalogue No. 41400-045, Gibco, Invitrogen, USA), 50 μg/ml L-ascorbic acid 1 mM sodium pyruvate 4 mM L-proline and 10 ng/ml TGFβ3. Medium was replaced twice a week without disturbing the cell mass. Cell sections were made after fixing the cell pellets with 4% PFA and embedding the cell pellets in low melting point agarose (1.5%). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Alcian blue stainings were conducted. Production of Extracellular Matrix— For ECM production the MPCs were cultured in culture plates or on nanofiber layers (as described below) in the presence of a BHK medium for 3-4 weeks at 37° C., without culture passaging, while changing the BHK medium with fresh BHK medium every 3-4 days. ECM was deposited by the cells to the culture plates or the NFLs. Nanofiber Layer (NFL) Fabrication and Cell Seeding— Two types of fiber scaffolds were fabricated: (i) fiber scaffold composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) and (ii) fiber scaffold composed of 7% PCL and 93% poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). Preparation of Polymer Solutions— The polymer solutions composition is described in Table 3, herein below. All polymers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. TABLE 3 NFL polymer solutions composition Scaffold type Polymer solution PCL 9 wt. % PCL 80K dissolved in a mixture of chloroform and dimethylformamide (DMF), 9:1 weight/weight (w/w) PLGA 1.4 wt. % PCL 80K + 9.3 wt. % PLGA 85-15 + 9.3 wt. % PLGA 50-50 dissolved in a mixture of chloroform and DMF, 8:2 (w/w) Table 3. “wt. %” = weight percent, i.e., gram per 100 ml solution; “w/w” = weight per weight ratio. Electrospinning Set Up— NFLs were fabricated using an electrospinning process as described in Srouji S. et al. 3-D nanofibrous electrospun multilayered construct is an alternative ECM mimicking scaffold. 2008. Mater Med 19:1249-1255, which is fully incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). All experiments were conducted at room temperature (˜25° C.) and a relative humidity of about 50%. The spinning parameters were as follow: the electrostatic field used was approximately 0.7 kV/cm and the distance between the spinneret (metal pipette needle) and aluminum collector plate was 13 cm. The flow rate of the solutions was 3 ml/hour (controlled by a syringe pump). The fibers were collected on microscope cover glasses (diameter 18 mm) that were placed on top of a slowly rotating plate collector. Seeding of NFL with Cells— For cell seeding the NFLs were sterilized using either Gas-treatment with ethylene oxide or plasma treatment for 1-2 seconds and then UV treatment for 6-12 hour. The NFLs were incubated for overnight at BHK medium to verify their sterilization. 2×105 MPCs were seeded on the NFL. The size of the NFL used was 18 mm in diameter (the coverslip size), and width of 30-100 μm. The NFLs were incubated in a 12 wells plate supplemented with 1-2 ml BHK medium. Cells were cultured for 2-4 weeks and medium was replaced twice a week. Before acellularization treatment MPCs-seeded NFLs were stained using a LIVE/DEAD® Cell Viability Assays (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer instructions for live cells staining. Acellularization Protocol— Following 3-4 weeks of MPCs culturing on NFL, the hybrid construct was decellularized using the following method: NFL-ECM device was treated with Hypertonic solution (50 mM Tris-Hcl, 1 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA) for overnight with gentle agitation. The treatment was followed by PBS wash and then treatment by 1% Triton X-100 for 1-2 hours at room temperature, with gentle agitation, followed by 2×PBS wash, and then treatment with 1 mg/ml DNase1 for 1 hour at 37° C. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)— NFL-ECM construct was washed by PBS and then treated with 3% Glutaraldehyde, at least for 30 minutes (which by this time the sample can be sealed tightly and kept in 4° C.). The NFL-ECM construct was dehydrated by the following washes: 25% ethanol for 10 minutes, 50% ethanol for 10 minutes, 70-75% ethanol for 10 minutes, 90-95% ethanol for 10 minutes, 100% ethanol for 10 minutes. The 100% ethanol was then drained and allowed to evaporate in a chemical hood at room temperature. Preparation of Samples for SEM— Sample (5×5 mm) were attached to a SEM stud with double sided carbon tape. The samples were coated with a layer of gold for 15 seconds in an Emitech SC7620 sputter coater, following which the gold coated samples were imaged by SEM, model FEI Phenom. Animal Implant Model— SCID beige mice (4-weeks-old, 30 gram each) and Sprague-Dawley rats (4 months old, 300 gram each) were used in the experiment. Animals were provided with food and water ad libitum. The light cycle and the room temperature were automatically controlled. Before the experiments, animals were housed in these conditions for 3-4 days to become acclimatized. Animal care was in accordance with the guidelines of the Committee for the Supervision of Animal Experiments, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology Implants containing either synthetic mesh [Prolift™ (Ethicon, Sommerville, N.J., USA], NFL alone or NFL-ECM were implanted subcutaneously on the back of the animals (1 construct per animal) under general anesthesia (Ketamine 100 mg/mL, xylazine 1:1). Upon termination of the experiment (additional 8 week) the implants were carefully removed from adjacent tissues and examined by histology analysis, as described. Example 1 Derivation of Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells (MSCs) from Pluripotent Stem Cells The present inventors have uncovered a novel method of generating mesenchymal progenitor cells from pluripotent stem cells (hESCs or hiPSCs). The major method steps include: (1) enzymatic dissociation (e.g., using collagenase B) of EBs (e.g., 10-days old) into small aggregates; (2) culturing of the cell aggregates as adherent cells to a tissue culture plate (devoid of gelatin or any adhesive material) for 2-3 days with BHK medium which triggers mesenchymal differentiation of the cells; (3) harvesting the cells and further dissociating them into a single cell suspension using. Trypsin. The cells are allowed again to attach the tissue culture plate surface and cultured with BHK medium. This protocol is simple and reproducible and can be used for generating mesenchymal progenitor cells which can produce high amounts of ECM for regenerative medicine applications. Experimental Results Generation of HFKT-iPSCs— Recently, a novel method for the derivation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from human plucked hair follicle keratinocytes (HFKT cells) was described by Novak et al., 2010 [Cell Reprogram. 2010, 12(6): 665-78)] using a single polycistronic STEMCCA lentiviral vector harboring the four reprogramming factors: Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4. These iPSCs were further treated with Cre-recombinase for the excision of the lentiviral vector and the generation of transgene-free iPSCs (FIGS. 1A (i-iii)). Specific HFKT-iPSCs clones (labeled as: KTR and KTN, were derived from two different individuals) were subject to cre-recombinase transfection that efficiently excised the lentiviral DNA, leaving a transgene-free hiPSC clones (labeled as: Cre-KTN7.3 or Cre-KTR13.4). Derivation of MPCs from pluripotent stem cells (hESCs or HFKT-iPSCs)— To induce differentiation, the cells were cultured in conditions where they begin to form aggregates of spontaneously differentiated embryoid bodies (EBs), which contain derivatives of all three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm. 10 day-old EBs were enzymatically dissociated into small aggregates of 10-30 cells (e.g., about 20 cells) using Collagenase B and DNAse. The small aggregates were cultured with EBs medium overnight (ON) and then with BHK medium for 2-3 days until cells expanded by at least 2 folds. Then the cells were collected and further dissociated using Trypsin and mesh filtration into a single cell suspension (FIGS. 1A-D). The suspended cells were further cultured in BHK medium to attain typical MPCs formation. Generation of MPCs from HFKT-iPSCs— MPCs were generated from the non-excised KTN7 clone as well as from the excised clones Cre-KTN7.3 or Cre-KTR13.4. The iPSCs were spontaneously differentiated into embryoid bodies (EBs), and MPCs were generated as described above and schematically shown in FIGS. 1A-D. Interestingly, MPCs derived from excised HFKT-iPSCs clones could grow faster and attain organized and condense network morphology following 2 weeks culturing (FIG. 1G) while MPCs derived from hESCs (FIG. 1E) or non-excised iPSCs (FIG. 1F) show relatively disorganized and disordered morphology. All MPCs described were able to proliferate efficiently up to passage 12-15, and then to show reduced growth rate and senescence. These results demonstrate the derivation of MPCs from pluripotent stem cells by the novel method of some embodiments of the invention. In addition, these results show that the use of a transgene-excised HFKT-iPSCs is advantageous over the use of non-excised HFKT-iPSCs or over human ESCs for derivation of MPCs and further ECM. Example 2 The Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells Derived According to the Method of Some Embodiments of the Invention Express Typical Mesenchymal Cell Surface Markers Experimental Results Characterization of MPCs by FACS Analysis— To characterize the newly derived MPCs the expression of typical mesenchymal cell surface markers was tested using Flow cytometry analyses and compared to that of mesenchymal stem cells derived from an adipose tissue, which is used as a gold-standard. The FACS analysis revealed that adipose-derived MSCs are positive for expression of CD29 (FIG. 2A, 94.98%), CD44 (FIG. 2B, 99.8%), CD105 (FIG. 2C, 98.56%), CD73 (FIG. 2D, 100%) and CD90 (FIG. 2E, 91.5%) and were almost completely negative for expression of CD34 (FIG. 2F, 1.27%) and CD45 (FIG. 2G, 0.84%). FIG. 2H shows that MPCs derived from excised HFKT-iPSCs clones (Cre-KTN7.3 or Cre-KTR13.4) were 90-100% positive for all tested MSCs markers (CD29, CD44, CD105, CD73 and CD90). MPCs derived from non-excised HFKT-iPSC clone (KTN7) and hESC (H9.2 cell line) show a reduced expression of CD105 marker (˜80% are CD105+). KTN7-MPCs shows reduced expression also for CD73 and CD29 markers (−80% are CD73+/CD29+). The hematopoietic markers CD34 and CD45 were almost negative (less than 20% of positive cells) in the MPCs clones that were tested. These results demonstrate that the mesenchymal progenitor cells exhibit a similar expression patter to that of adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells. Example 3 The Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells Derived According to the Method of Some Embodiments of the Invention Exhibit a Significantly Reduced Ability to Differentiate into an Adipogenic Lineage Experimental Results The MPCs of Some Embodiments of the Invention are Capable of Forming a mineralized matrix— The mesenchymal progenitor cells isolated according to the method of some embodiments of the invention were cultured in an osteogenic medium for 28-30 days and at the end of the culturing period the cells were stain with Alizarin Red (which tests presence of a mineralized matrix). As shown by Alizarin Red (AZR) staining calcium deposits and bone nodule formation was visible in both hESC-derived MPCs and iPSc-derived MPCs (FIGS. 3A-D). Thus, all the lines of mesenchymal progenitor cells were capable of forming mineralization in the culture at day 30 of culturing in an osteogenic medium. The MPCs of Some Embodiments of the Invention Exhibit Low or No Differentiation Capacity into an Adipogenic Lineage— As shown in FIGS. 3E-H, while adipogenic differentiation was well established from adipose-derived MSCs by Oil-Red-O (O-R-O) staining (FIG. 3E), there were only traces of adipogenic differentiation in hESCs-MPCs (FIG. 3F) and absence of any fat drops in iPSC-MPCs derived from both excised and non-excised HFKT-iPSCs clones (FIGS. 3G and 3H). These results demonstrate that the MPCs generated by the method of some embodiments of the invention have a significantly reduced ability to differentiate into the adipogenic lineage, and suggest that these cells have a more limited differentiation potential as compared to mesenchymal stem cells isolated from adult tissues. The MPCs of Some Embodiments of the Invention Exhibit a Reduced Adipogenic Potential as Compared to Adult Mesenchymal Stem Cells (e.g., AD5T) Under Identical Assay Conditions (e.g., RT-PCR)— Further RT-PCR analyses of the cultured cells using various adipogenic markers revealed that while the PPARγ transcription factor, known to regulate the primary adipogenic differentiation phase, was expressed in all cells type cultured in adipogenic medium (FIG. 13A), the adipogenic markers expressed by adipose cells such as leptin (FIG. 13B), adiponectin (FIG. 13C), Adipocyte protein 2 (AP2) (FIG. 13D) and Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) (FIG. 13E) were mostly expressed by adult MSCs (AD5T), while a significantly less expression or absence of expression was shown with MPCs derived from hair-follicle derived iPSCs or from hESC. These data indicate that functional adipocytes were not derived from the pluripotent stem cells derived-MPCs following adipogenic differentiation, as was also shown by Oil-R-O staining (FIGS. 3E-H). The MPCs of Some Embodiments of the Invention are Capable of Differentiation into a Chondrogenic Differentiation— Chondrogenic differentiation was well observed in the excised HFKT-iPSCs clones by Alciane Blue (AB) staining (FIGS. 3K and 3L), but could less efficiently generated by the adipose derived MSCs (FIG. 31) and hESCs derived MPCs (FIG. 3J). The MPCs of Some Embodiments of the Invention Exhibit Increased Differentiation Potential into the Osteogenic Lineage— The differentiation potential of the mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) generated according to some embodiments of the invention into the osteogenic lineage was tested in vitro by culturing the cells in an osteogenic medium and staining the cells contained in the culture plates with Alizarin-red. As shown in FIGS. 4A-J, bone differentiation is highly elevated in MPCs derived from the excised HFKT-iPSCs clones relative to MPCs derived from hESCs clones or from adipose MSCs. These differentiation assays demonstrate that MPCs are different from adipose-derived MSCs, especially in their significantly reduced ability to differentiate into the adipogenic lineage, and increased expression of osteogenic markers (e.g., calcium deposits which is stained with Alizarin red) when induced into the osteogenic lineage. Example 4 Characterization of MPCS-Derived Extracellular Matrix (ECM) For ECM generation the MPCs were cultured for long period (3-4 weeks) at high density in BHK medium without culture passaging. The long culturing triggers their differentiation into more compact and organized cell layers composed mainly of various types of collagens and other structural proteins as actin, fibronectin, vimentin and laminin FIGS. 5A-L represent the expression of the ECM main proteins in long-term matrix formation obtained from 4 weeks cultured MPCs derived from either hESCs or HFKT-iPSCs in comparison with matrix obtained from adipose derived MSCs. Collagens are the Main Proteins Expressed in the ECM Derived from the MPCs of Some Embodiments of the Invention— Trichrome staining indicates that collagens are the main proteins expressed for all derived matrixes. The collagen to structure is particularly condensed and organized in matrix obtained from Cre-KTN7.3 MPCs (FIG. 5D), while cells to collagen ratio is relatively reduced at this matrix (FIG. 5L). Specific structures of actin can be observed at Cre-KTN7.3 matrix as well (FIG. 5H), while only few cells were found to express actin in matrixes derived from either hESCs (FIG. 5F) or the non-excised KTN7 clone (FIG. 5G). The ECM Generated by the MPCs of Some Embodiments of the Invention Include Vimentin, Fibronectin and Laminin— As shown in FIGS. 5M-X, vimentin, fibronectin and laminin are positively expressed in all tested matrixes but their expression is increased within matrixes derived from either adipose MSCs (FIGS. 5M, 5Q and 5U) and Cre-KTN7.3 MPCs (FIGS. 5P, 5T and 5X). Overall, results show that most significant expression of ECM components could be detected at ECM generated by the excised HFKT-iPSCs clones [results are shown here for Cre-KTN7.3 clone, similar data were found for the other excised clone Cre-KTR13.4 (Data not shown)]. FIGS. 6A-H describe RT-PCR analysis of ECM markers. RT-PCR was done for total RNA samples ECM samples obtained from Adipose derived MSCs, hESCs derived MPCs, KTN7 derived MPCs, Cre-KTN7.3 derived MPCs, and Cre-KTR13.4 derived MPCs. Results show that the RNA levels of ECM proteins can be observed within the ECM matrices derived from various stem cells sources. However, while some ECM proteins show reduced RNA levels at matrices derived from hESCs or KTN7MPCs (such as fibronectin, decorin, tensacin C and elastin), their RNA levels are significantly increased at the ECM samples obtained from the excised HFKT-iPSCs clones Cre-KTN7.3 and Cre-KTR13.4. Overall, ECM characterization by histology, immunostaining and RT-PCR assays indicates that ECM derived from excised HFKT-iPSCs clones is efficiently secreted as described for ECM matrix derived from adipose-MSCs and have higher expression of ECM proteins relative to other pluripotent sources as hESCs, non-excised HFKT-iPSCs and fibroblasts iPSCs (data not shown). These data suggest that excised HFKT-iPSCs-MPCs might be the best pluripotent source for generating ECM for tissue engineering applications. It should be noted that iPSCs are a better source relative to adipose MSCs since adipose MSCs need to be harvested from the patients by invasive procedure, while HFKT-iPSCs are derived from plucked hair. Moreover, adipose MSCs are not pluripotent cells and they have reduced proliferation capacity in culture while iPSCs are pluripotent cells that have potentially unlimited capacity to proliferate in culture at their undifferentiated stage. Therefore excised HFKT-iPSCs can be used as unlimited, available and homogeneous ECM source. Example 5 Generation of Hybrid NfL (Nanofibers Layer)—ECM Device Tissue acellularization provides ECM free of cellular components that can be transplanted in mammals without inducing acute immune response and host rejection. The generation of high amount of acellular stem cells-derived ECM can be used as a shelf product for various surgical applications. However, many efforts to decellularize ECM, generated from either adipose-MSCs or pluripotent sources as hESCs or iPSCs-MPCs, resulted in a too weak matrix that cannot be transplanted using a surgical sutures. Therefore an acellular hybrid device containing nanofibers layer and stem cells-derived ECM was developed. Experimental Results The Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells of Some Embodiments of the Invention Efficiently Proliferate all Over the NFL— Adipose MSCs or Cre-KTN7.3/Cre-KTR13.4—MPCs were seeded on electrospun biodegradable NFL, composed of FDA-approved poly caprolactone (PCL) and Poly lactic glycolic acid (PLGA). Cells were cultured on the NFL for 2-4 weeks in the presence of the BHK medium and were found to well proliferate and secrete ECM within the NFL. Following culturing period, the stem cell-derived-ECM-NFL construct was subject to an acellularization process and the cellular as well as the acellular hybrid devices were analyzed by vital cells staining, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histology staining. CFDA (Carboxyfluorescein diacetate) vital staining was used to demonstrate live cells. As shown in FIG. 7A, the cellular hybrid exhibits extensive growth of Cre-KTN7.3-MPCs seeded on PLGA NFL for only 2 weeks, with expansion of cells on the NFL and between the nanofibers. FIG. 7B demonstrates the efficient acellularization treatment which eliminates all live cells from the NFL-ECM device. FIGS. 7C-H show confocal microscopy analysis of both cellular and acellular NFL-ECM devices, indicating that cells were proliferating all over the NFL dimensions and not only on the NFL surface. MPCs Produce ECM on, Below, and Between the Nano Fibers— Scanning electron microscopy was used to analyze the ECM quality before and after acellularization treatment. FIGS. 8A-B demonstrate that ECM generated within the NFL is intact and is not damaged by the acellularization treatment. ECM generation and secretion within the NFL, by the excised HFKT-iPSCs derived MPCs (e.g., KTR13.4-MPCs), was analyzed at various culturing periods (FIG. 8C-F). Results show that the cells produce ECM on, below and between the nanofibers (typical morphology of collagen fibers are observed within the fibers following 1-2 culture weeks). The MPCs derived-ECM was found to completely cover the NFL surface following 3 weeks of cells culturing (FIG. 8F). The Massive ECM Generated within the NFL and the ECM Proteins are not Harmed by the Acellularization Process— Histology and immunostaining analysis were performed on the cellular and acellular NFL-ECM devices to further confirm the cells removal by acellularization treatment while ECM components remained intact. Hematoxilin and Eosin (HE) staining demonstrate the elimination of viable cells (e.g., FIGS. 9A and 9D), while Trichrom (TC) staining and fibronectin (FN) immunostaining indicate that massive ECM generated within the NFL and the ECM proteins are not harmed by the acellularization treatment (FIGS. 9B, 9C, 9E and 9F). Example 6 In Vivo Transplantation of NFL-ECM Device The present inventors have compared the efficiency of the NFL-ECM device of some embodiments of the invention with a surgical synthetic mesh, as follows. The NFL-ECM hybrid device is a novel biodegradable biological mesh that might better stimulate host cells proliferation and tissue regeneration. This stem cell-derived ECM-NFL construct could be used as a biological support highly suitable to cure PFD disorders. The in-vivo responses of SCID mice and rats to acellular NFL-ECM implants, relative to NFL alone, as well as to surgical synthetic mesh, were tested. The in-vivo experiment was done by subcutaneously transplantation of 2 identical implants in both neck sides of SCID Beige mice, as well as transplantation of similar implants within the rat two thighs. The present inventors compared the in vivo efficiency of commercially available surgical synthetic meshes (Prolift, Ethicon, N.J.) to two NFL devices: (i) PCL-NFL with no cells; and (ii) NFL-ECM, i.e., an MPC-derived NFL-ECM made from a PCL-NFL which was cultured with Cre-KTN7.3 MPCs for 4 weeks and which was further subjected to an acellularization process. FIGS. 10A-D demonstrate the subcutaneous transplantation of synthetic mesh, and NFL alone (not shown) or NFL-ECM in SCID beige mice and Sprague-Dawley Rats. The implants are shown here before suturing the incisions. Then, the implants were well subcutaneously transplanted and covered by the animal skin. Nine weeks post transplantation the animals were sacrificed and analyzed. Interestingly, in both SCID mice and rats, 75% of synthetic meshes implants were completely discharged and could be clearly observed externally of the animal skin (FIGS. 10E and 10G). Moreover, the SCID mice transplanted with the synthetic mesh were sick and slim (e.g., the mouse seen in FIG. 10E) compared to the mice transplanted by either NFL (not shown) or NFL-ECM (e.g., the mouse seen in FIG. 10F), indicating a severe host response to the synthetic implants. In contrast, the NFL and the hybrid NFL-ECM implants were not rejected from the animal's body and the transplanted SCID mice exhibit a healthy apparent (FIG. 10F). Rejection of the Synthetic Mesh Implant by the Recipient Animal— Histology analyses of the synthetic mesh implants sections by hematoxilin & Eosin (HE) and trichrome (TC) staining revealed rigorous granuloma containing lymphocytes and neutrophils surrounding the synthetic fibers, observed as blue and white ellipsoids which are not stained by the histochemistry reagents (FIG. 11A-D). Integration of the Hybrid NFL-ECM Implant within the Host Tissue of the Recipient Animal— FIGS. 12A-F demonstrate the histology results of the rats and SCID mice following 9 weeks of transplantation with NFL alone (NFL only, FIGS. 12A and 12D) relative to the hybrid NFL-ECM implant in SCID mice (FIGS. 12B and 12E) and in rats (FIGS. 12C and 12F). Results indicate that NFL, composed of PCL material, significantly induced the animal immune response (FIGS. 12A and 12D). A granulomas, particularly containing macrophages, are observed within the NFL region, surrounding the PCL nanofibers that were not yet degraded following 9 weeks in vivo. In contrast, the immune response against the hybrid NFL-ECM implant is reduced in both SCID mice and rats (FIGS. 12B, 12C, 12E and 12F). Although granuloma regions could be observed within the NFL-ECM hybrid, better integration with the host tissue was occurred, new blood vessels were emerged and strong collagen structures were generated around and within the hybrid device. The collagen structures indicating for desirable fibrosis formation that will ultimately replace the biodegradable implant and be used as the host reconstructed tissue. These results demonstrate the contribution of the stem cells derived ECM, which is integrated on, below and between the NFL, in tissue reconstruction relative to NFL alone or to currently available synthetic meshes, and suggest an optional alternative for the displeasing surgical synthetic mesh. Example 7 In Vivo Transplantation of PLGA NFL with ECM Generated by Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells According to Some Embodiments of the Invention NFLs, made of PLGA, were tested in vivo since PLGA has rapid degradation properties, and therefore might be less immunogenic as compared to the PCL-NFL. Nanofiber layer (NFL) composed of either PLGA alone (FIGS. 14A, D and G), or of PLGA with live HFKT-iPSCs Cre KTN7.3 MPCs (before acellularization, FIGS. 14B, E and H) or of PLGA-ECM (made of HFKT-iPSCs Cre KTN7.3 MPCs cells after acellularization; FIGS. 14C, F and I) were used for transplantation in Sprague-Dawley Rats. The rats were sutured and well covered by the animal skin. Two identical implants were transplanted within the rat's two thighs. Eight weeks post transplantation the animals were sacrificed and implants were subjected to histology analysis on paraffin sections. As shown in FIGS. 14A and D, PLGA-NFL with no ECM retains its original structure and shows no integration with the host tissue, as well as a significant granuloma response, similarly to the findings observed using the PCL-NFL with no ECM (FIGS. 12A and D). A much better integration and a reduced host immune response was shown following implantation of PLGA-ECM. Following acellularization, the PLGA-ECM device shows better integration into the host tissue and high degradation rate (FIGS. 14C and F). Moreover, many new and large blood vessels were emerged at the implant site (FIG. 14F). These results demonstrate the good biocompatibility of the developed hybrid device composed of NFL-ECM following acellularization, particularly, when PLGA-NFL is used in combination with acellular ECM. This hybrid device suggests an optional construct for soft tissues regeneration. Example 8 In Vivo Transplantation of Net-PCL NFL with ECM Generated By Mesenchymal Progenitor Cells According to Some Embodiments of the Invention Generation of a Composite Device Made of a Net, Electrospun Nanofibers and Extracellular Matrix— The present inventors have generated a composite device made of a commercially available Net, Prolift net (Ethicon), which was further coated with electrospun nanofibers made of PCL, PLGA or a combination of PCL/PLGA nanofibers (FIG. 15B). The coated Net was used as a substrate for MPC culturing and ECM secretion during 4 weeks in the presence of BHK medium. The hybrid device was further subjected to acellularization process and then to lyophilization (FIG. 15C). SEM analysis of the hybrid NET-NFL-ECM device shows that the ECM fully covers the NFL (FIG. 15D), similarly to the results obtained with the NFL-ECM alone (FIGS. 8A-F), demonstrating that the net (mesh) below the NFL does not affect this process. Superiority of NFL Over a Synthetic Net In Vivo— Rats were transplanted with either a synthetic Net (Prolift Net) or with NFL PCL (both were devoid of ECM), and following 8 weeks the rats were sacrificed, the implant area was exposed and a sample from the implant surrounding tissue was subjected to histological analysis. As shown in FIG. 16A-D, while the Net implant was extruded out of the transplantation site to below the skin (FIG. 16C), the NFL implant was in the right tissue position, nicely coated with fibrotic tissue (FIG. 16D). Further histological analysis revealed that while the Net implant was located within the fat tissue and external to the muscle tissue, the NFL implant is well located along the muscle tissue (the original implantation site) (FIG. 17C). In Vivo Effect of the Net-NFL-ECM Device of Some Embodiments of the Invention— Hybrid devices were prepared using a Prolift™ (Ethicon, Sommerville, N.J., USA) Net coated with 30 μm PCL nanofibers, which was used as a substrate for culturing either adult adipose derived MSCs-AD5T or HFKT-iPSCs-Cre KTN7.3 MPCs, or without ECM. Following 4 weeks of culturing, the hybrid devices were subjected to an acellularization procedure and transplanted into the rat abdominal wall. Two duplicates were transplanted from each scaffold type. Eight weeks post transplantation the implants were removed along with the surrounding tissue, stained with H&E and photographed. As shown in FIGS. 18D-F, a significant generation of new blood vessels was observed in implants made of NET-NFL-ECM derived from HFKT-iPSCs-Cre KTN7.3 MPCs (FIG. 18F), as compared to implants made of NET-NFL-ECM derived from AD5T cells (FIG. 18E). In contrast, no blood vessels were shown in tissues implanted with the Net-NFL devoid of ECM (FIG. 18D). Further histological analyses revealed that while the Net-NFL implant was located at the external fat tissue (FIG. 18H), the Net-NFL-ECM implants were located at their original site near the rat's muscle tissue (FIGS. 18K and N). In addition, while no significant immune response occurred around any of the implants (FIGS. 18I, L and O), a massive fibrous collagen structure was generated within the ECM-derived implants (FIGS. 18L and O). These results demonstrate that implants made of ECM derived from stem cells sources significantly affect tissue regeneration in vivo, while ECM derived from HFKT-iPSCs-Cre KTN7.3 MPCs also contributes to angiogenesis and integration of the implant within the rat tissues. Analysis and Discussion The Derivation of MPCs from HFKT-iPSCs and their Increased Capability to Secrete ECM and to Differentiate into Cartilage Lineage— For the first time the present inventors generated MPCs from iPSCs. Moreover, the present inventors generated MPCs from various pluripotent sources such as H9.2-hESCs, human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) derived iPSCs, HFKT-iPSCs and transgene-free HFKT-iPSCs. The development of the NFL-ECM device: For the first time the present inventors developed a massive and stable device that can carry the stem cell-derived ECM components following acellularization. The acellularization procedure was found to mostly eliminate the live cells, leaving the matrix components intact. Robust and Optimized “Off-the-Shelf” Device for Regenerative Medicine Applications: The combined NFL-ECM acellular device is a stable and handy product that can be used as an “off-the-shelf” mesh with specific advantages of homogeneity, availability, bioactivity, biocompatibility and safety for surgical tissue reconstruction applications. To generate “off-the-shelf” biological scaffolds suitable to several surgical applications the present inventors developed a device including electrospun biodegradable nanofiber layer (NFL) composed of FDA-approved poly caprolactone to (PCL) and Poly lactic glycolic acid (PLGA), seeded with either adult MSCs or HFKT-Cre-iPSCs-MPCs. These mesenchymal progenitors extensively proliferate on the NFL for ˜3 weeks at BHK medium, and efficiently secrete ECM components within the NFL. Following 3 weeks of culturing, the stem cell-derived-ECM-NFL construct underwent an acellularization treatment to eliminate live cells. This humanized acellular ECM-NFL device could serve as a robust clinical off-the-shelf product, providing the mechanical cues and the biological factors needed to support tissue reconstruction. In contrast to the currently used synthetic foreign mesh, this stem cell-derived NFL-ECM device triggers the regeneration of the native tissue and prevents undesired inflammation and further rejection. Human pluripotent stem cells are a practically unlimited, standardized and uniform human source for ECM generation. The matrix derived from these most early progenitors therefore displays excellent bioactivity, biocompatibility and safety qualities. Synthetic scaffolds can perform superior mechanical characteristics, but they can never be integrated into the host tissue. Their biocompatibility is very poor and causes numerous long-term complications, such as severe infections, chronic immune response and potential toxic byproducts. Several in-vivo assays were performed using acellular as well as cellular NFL-ECM devices, including subcutaneous transplantation in mice and rats.
