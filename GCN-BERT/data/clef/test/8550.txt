FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to transdermal pharmaceutical compositions containing nifedipine, pentoxifylline, ketamine hydrochloride, gabapentin, lidocaine, and prilocaine that may be used to treat conditions such as circulatory disorders and peripheral neuropathy. BACKGROUND A circulatory disorder is any disorder that affects the circulatory system. Circulatory disorders may arise from problems with the heart, blood vessels, or the blood, and may result in diminished blood flow and oxygen supply to the tissues. Common circulatory disorders include hypertension, angina, and arteriosclerosis. People with certain diseases such as diabetes, or kidney failure may be more likely to have circulatory problems. Peripheral neuropathy is a condition involving nerve-end damage in the body, and it is most often manifested as one or a combination of motor, sensory, sensorimotor, or autonomic neural dysfunctions. Peripheral neuropathy may result from a wide variety of causes. For example, peripheral neuropathies can be genetically acquired, can result from a systemic disease, can manifest as a post-surgical complication, or can be induced by a toxic agent. One common type of neuropathy is diabetic neuropathy which is caused by diabetes. Specific classes of drugs that may be used for the non-invasive treatment of neuropathy include: (1) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); (2) narcotic analgesics; (3) tricyclic antidepressants; and (4) anticonvulsants. Drugs belonging to these classes are available commercially as oral products. However, because drugs belonging to these classes are distributed systemically throughout the body, their various side effects limit their effectiveness. The NSAIDs, for example, when taken orally cause gastric distress including ulcers. The other three classes share other common side effects, including drowsiness, dizziness, disorientation, and gastrointestinal upset. The present invention is intended to provide pharmaceutical compositions capable of effectively treating conditions such as circulatory disorders and peripheral neuropathy. SUMMARY The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing nifedipine, pentoxifylline, ketamine hydrochloride, gabapentin, lidocaine, and prilocaine, and the use of these compositions to treat conditions such as circulatory disorders and peripheral neuropathy. The pharmaceutical compositions described herein may include any formulations that are suitable for topical application.

In a further embodiment a pharmaceutical composition of the invention consists essentially of nifedipine, pentoxifylline, ketamine hydrochloride, gabapentin, lidocaine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, prilocaine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, the phrase “consisting essentially of” limits a composition to the specified materials or steps and those additional, undefined components that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the composition, such as, for example, additional active ingredients. In an additional embodiment a pharmaceutical composition of the invention consists of nifedipine in an amount of about 10%, pentoxifylline in an amount of about 5%, ketamine hydrochloride in an amount of about 10%, gabapentin in an amount of about 6%, lidocaine hydrochloride monohydrate in an amount of about 3.7%, prilocaine hydrochloride in an amount of about 3.5%, vitamin E acetate in an amount of about 1%, sodium metabisulfite in an amount of about 0.5%, butylated hydroxytoluene in an amount of about 0.05%, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount of about 60.7%. “Consisting of” refers to the inclusion of exactly one element of a number or list of elements.
