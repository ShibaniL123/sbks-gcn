Example Compound 2
2-oxo-2-((1,3,5-trimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)ethyl 2-(2-methyl-1H-indol-1-yl)acetate
Step 1: 1,3,5-trimethyl-4-nitro-1H-pyrazole
To a suspension of 3,5-dimethyl-4-nitro-1H-pyrazole (201 mg, 1.4 mmol) and K2CO3 (216 mg, 1.6 mmol) in dry DMF (1 mL), iodomethane (93 µL, 1.5 mmol) was added at room temperature. After 5 h, the reaction was heated to 40 °C and additional iodomethane (90 µL) and K2CO3 (200 mg) was added. After 1.5 h, the reaction was quenched with Et3N (150 µL), diluted with H2O (15 mL) and EtOAc (15 mL). The two layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (2 x 10 mL). The combined organics were dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Purification by column chromatography (30% EtOAc in PE) yielded 206 mg (93%) of the title compound
