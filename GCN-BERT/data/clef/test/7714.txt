[Reaction Scheme 3-10] Synthesis of [Compound 6]
The same procedure as in Reaction Scheme 1-13 of Synthesis Example 1 was carried out, with the exception of using Intermediate 3-g and Intermediate 3-i instead of Intermediate 1-h and Intermediate 1-l, respectively, to afford Compound 6 (3.3 g): yield 41.3%
