HYDROCHLORIDE SALTS OF AN ANTIBIOTIC COMPOUND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel hydrochloride salts of a cross-linked glycopeptide-cephalosporin antibiotic compound and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such hydrochloride salts. This invention also relates to processes for preparing, and methods of using, such hydrochloride salts and compositions. State of the Art Cross-linked glycopeptide-cephalosporin antibiotics are known in the art. For example, such antibiotics are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,878,868 Β2; 6,974,797 Β2; 7,067,481 Β2; 7,067,482 Β2; 7,601,690 Β2; and in Long et al., J. Antibiot. 61(10): 595-602 (2008); and Long et al., J. Antibiot. 61(10): 603-614 (2008). These antibiotics are reported to be useful for treating Gram-positive bacterial infections, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci aureus (MRSA) infections. See, for example, Leuthner et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010, 54(9):3799; Hegde et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.2012, 56(3): 1578; Blais et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.2012, 56(3): 1584; and Tyrell et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.2012, 56(4):2194. One such cross-linked glycopeptide-cephalosporin antibiotic is 26-[[[3-[[(Z)-[l(2-amino-5-chloro-4-thiazolyl)-2-[[(6R,7R)-2-carboxy-8-oxo-3-(pyridiniomethyl)-5-thia- 1 -azabicyclo[4.2.0] oct-2-en-7 -yl] amino] -2-oxoethylidene] amino]oxy]propyl] amino] carbonyl]-26-decarboxyvancomycin, which has the chemical structure: This compound, also known as TD-1792, has been disclosed previously as either a tri(trifluoroacetic acid) salt or a trihydrochloride salt. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 6,974,797 Β2 at column 34, line 60, to column 35, line 20. The disclosed salt forms, however, have several disadvantages. First, perfluorocarboxylic acids, such as trifluoroacetic acid, have been reported to produce adverse hepatic effects when administered to rats. See, for example, Just et al., Hepatology, 9(4), 570-581 (1989). Therefore, a trifluoroacetic acid salt of this compound may not be pharmaceutically-acceptable for administration to patients. Additionally, the trihydrochloride salt of this compound has been found to decompose significantly when stored at room temperature or even at refrigerated temperature (about 2 to about 8 °C). Therefore, the trihydrochloride salt may not be acceptable for use in a commercial formulation since pharmaceutical formulations are often stored for significant periods of time prior to use. Accordingly, a need exists for new pharmaceutically-acceptable salt forms of this compound that have improved storage stability. Also of interest are new pharmaceutical compositions containing such salts. Of particular interest are new pharmaceutical compositions that further improve the storage stability of the compound. The existing scientific literature, however, is often contradictory with regard to which excipients are useful for providing increased storage stability for pharmaceutical agents. For example, ΕΡ 0 325 112 Α1 teaches that cephalosporins are stabilized by dissolving the cephalosporin with lactose, glucose, sucrose or galactose (and optionally, glycine), and then drying the solution. In contrast, U.S. Patent No. 5,254,545 teaches that the pharmaceutical preparations of ΕΡ 0 325 112 Α1 are not satisfactory to stabilize a particular cephalosporin compound and instead the cephalosporin is formulated with (i) lactose, (ii) citric acid or a sodium salt thereof and (iii) arginine or a hydrochloride thereof or sodium chloride to provide a stable preparation. Moreover, with regard to the use of carbohydrates, Burgess et al., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2, 97 (1994) teaches that the decomposition of certain cephalosporins is catalyzed by glucose, galactose, maltose, sucrose, mannitol and a-methylglucoside in aqueous solutions at pH 9-11. More recently, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US 2010/010278 Al discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various excipients used to prepare freeze-dried formulations of cephalosporins, such as polyols and amino acids (page 1, paragraphs 004 to 0019), and concludes that the scientific literature is contradictory and does not make it possible to predict which formulations will provide stability for the freeze-dried product (page 1, paragraph 0020). This document describes freeze-dried formulations for cephalosporin derivatives containing at least one stabilizer selected from carbohydrates, polyhydric alcohols and polyvinyl pyrrolidone. With regard to pharmaceutical compositions for glycopeptides, ΕΡ 0 438 747 Al discloses stabilized freeze-dried compositions of glycopeptides, such as orienticins A to D, chloroorienticins A to Ε, and vancomycin, comprising 0.05 parts by weight or more of one or more saccharides. JP 414249 Β2 discloses freeze-dried preparations of vancomycin comprising amino acids selected from arginine, alanine, aspartic acid, histidine and glycine. Additionally, JP 2010105965 A discloses preparations of vancomycin containing water-soluble acid amides, such as nicotinamide. Thus, a wide variety of excipients have been disclosed for use in formulating cephalosporins and glycopeptides. The scientific literature, however, is often contradictory as to which excipient to use with a particular pharmaceutical agent. As a result, identifying an excipient or combinations of excipients that improves the storage stability of a cross-linked cephalosporin-glycopeptide is particularly challenging since such compounds contain both cephalosporin and glycopeptide moieties in the same molecule.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compounds of formula I. Such compounds are acid addition salts of hydrochloric acid and 26-[[[3-[[(Z)-[l-(2-amino-5-chloro-4-thiazolyl)-2-[[(67?,77?)-2-carboxy-8-oxo-3-(pyridiniomethyl)-5-thia-l- azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-7-yl]amino]-2-oxoethylidene]amino]oxy]propyl]amino]- carbonyl]-26-decarboxyvancomycin. In the compounds of formula I, any atom capable of being protonated by the hydrochloric acid (such as an amino group or carboxylic acid group) may be so protonated to form a salt and all such forms are included within the scope of this invention unless otherwise indicated. Definitions When describing this invention, the following terms have the following meanings unless otherwise indicated. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” means a salt that is acceptable for administration to a patient or a mammal, such as a human (e.g., salts having acceptable mammalian safety for a given dosage regime). Representative pharmaceutically acceptable salts include salts of acetic, ascorbic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethanesulfonic, edisylic, fumaric, gentisic, gluconic, glucoronic, glutamic, hippuric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, naphthalenesulfonic, naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic, naphthalene-2,6-disulfonic, nicotinic, nitric, orotic, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, p-toluenesulfonic and xinafoic acid, and the like. The term “refrigerated temperature” means a temperature of about 2 °C to about 8 °C. The term “room temperature” means ambient temperature in a chemistry laboratory, typically about 18 °C to about 25 °C. The term “therapeutically effective amount” means an amount sufficient to effect treatment when administered to a patient in need of treatment. The term “treating” or “treatment” means: 30 (a) preventing a disease or medical condition from occurring, i.e., prophylactic treatment of a patient or subject; (b) ameliorating a disease or medical condition, i.e., eliminating or causing regression of the disease or medical condition in a patient; (c) suppressing a disease or medical condition, i.e., slowing or arresting the development of the disease or medical condition in a patient; or (d) alleviating the symptoms of a disease or medical condition in a patient. General Synthetic Procedures The compounds of formula I are typically prepared by first providing or forming an aqueous composition containing 26-[[[3-[[(Z)-[l-(2-amino-5-chloro-4-thiazolyl)-2-[[(67?,77?)-2-carboxy-8-oxo-3-(pyridiniomethyl)-5-thia-l-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-7- yl]amino]-2-oxoethylidene]amino]oxy]propyl]amino]carbonyl]-26-decarboxyvancomycin and from about 1 to about 2 molar equivalents of hydrochloric acid. The aqueous composition is then lyophilized to provide a compound of formula I. The aqueous composition is typically prepared by adding the appropriate amount of dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid (such as 1 Ν aqueous hydrochloric acid) to an aqueous composition of 26-[[[3-[[(Z)-[l-(2-amino-5-chloro-4-thiazolyl)-2-[[(67?,77?)-2-carboxy-8-oxo-3-(pyridiniomethyl)-5-thia-l-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-7-yl]amino]-2- oxoethylidene]amino]oxy]propyl]amino]carbonyl]-26-decarboxyvancomycin. Generally, the aqueous composition containing the compound is analyzed by, for example, HPLC to determine the amount of the compound present in the aqueous solution. Once the amount of the compound is known, the appropriate amount of hydrochloric acid is added so that the resulting aqueous composition contains from about 1 to about 2 molar equivalents of hydrochloric acid per molar equivalent of compound. Typically, the hydrochloric acid is added at a temperature in the range of from about -10 °C to about 25 °C. In some cases, the aqueous solution may already contain some hydrochloric acid (e.g., less than 1 molar equivalent) and in such cases, the amount of hydrochloric acid already present in the aqueous solution is taken into consideration when adding additional hydrochloric acid. Alternatively, if the aqueous solution containing the 26-[[[3-[[(Z)-[l(2-amino-5-chloro-4-thiazolyl)-2-[[(67?,77?)-2-carboxy-8-oxo-3-(pyridiniomethyl)-5-thia- 1 -azabicyclo[4.2.0] oct-2-en-7 -yl] amino] -2-oxoethylidene]amino] oxy]propyl] amino]carbonyl]-26-decarboxyvancomycin contains more than about 2 equivalents of hydrochloric acid, the aqueous solution can be neutralized with base, such as an alkali bicarbonate, alkali carbonate and the like, to adjust the molar ratio of hydrochloric acid to the compound to be in the range of from about 1 to about 2. By way of example, sodium bicarbonate may be used as the base. The base is typically added in the form of a dilute aqueous solution, e.g., such as a 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The base is typically added to the aqueous solution at a temperature in the range of from about -10 °C to about 25 °C. When describing such aqueous compositions, it will be recognized that the hydrochloric acid protonates the compound so that the aqueous composition contains the acid addition salt of hydrochloric acid and the compound. Thus, any reference to the molar ratio of the compound to hydrochloric acid will be understood to refer to the molar ratio of the components in the form of the acid addition salts. Once the aqueous composition containing the compound and from about 1 to about 2 molar equivalents of hydrochloric acid has been formed, the aqueous composition is typically lyophilized to provide a compound of formula I as a lyophilized powder. The lyophilization is generally conducted at a temperature in the range of from about -60 °C to about -20 °C under reduced pressure in the range of from about 20 torr (mm Hg) to about 100 torr, such as about 40 torr to 60 torr. The lyophilization is generally conducted for about 48 hours to about 200 hours or until the volatile components are substantially removed. The lyophilization provides the compound of formula I as a lyophilized powder. Alternatively, the compound of formula I can be precipitated and isolated by fdtration or centrifugation. For example, an excess of an organic diluent can be used to precipitate the compound of formula I from an aqueous composition. Suitable organic diluents include, by way of illustration, acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol, acetone, and the like. If desired, the precipitate can optionally be washed with a suitable organic diluent. For example, when acetone is used to precipitate the compound of formula I, the resulting precipitate is optionally washed with acetone and then dried. Typically, the isolation procedure is conducted at a temperature of from about 0 °C to about 30 °C, typically at a range of between about 5 °C to about 20 °C, and all filtration, washing and drying steps are done under an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen, argon and the like. Procedures for preparing 26-[[[3-[[(Z)-[l-(2-amino-5-chloro-4-thiazolyl)-2-[[(67?,77?)-2-carboxy-8-oxo-3-(pyridiniomethyl)-5-thia-l-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-7- yl]amino]-2-oxoethylidene]amino]oxy]propyl]amino]carbonyl]-26-decarboxyvancomycin are known in the art. For example, the preparation of this compound is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,974,797 Β2 and Long et al., J. Antibiot. 61(10): 603-614 (2008). By way of illustration, vancomycin or a salt thereof can be reacted with compound A having the formula: or a salt thereof, in the presence of a peptide coupling reagent to provide 26-[[[3-[[(Z)-[l(2-amino-5-chloro-4-thiazolyl)-2-[[(6i?,7i?)-2-carboxy-8-oxo-3-(pyridiniomethyl)-5-thia- 1 -azabicyclo[4.2.0] oct-2-en-7 -yl] amino] -2-oxoethylidene] amino]oxy]propyl] amino] carbonyl]-26-decarboxyvancomycin or a salt thereof. Typically, this reaction is conducted by contacting vancomycin or a salt thereof, with about 1 to about 1.1 molar equivalents of a peptide coupling reagent in a diluent, such as DMF, DMSO, or a mixture thereof. This reaction is typically conducted at a temperature in the range of from about -10 °C to about 10 °C for about 10 minutes to about 60 minutes or until the reaction is substantially complete. A solution of about 0.9 to about 1.1 molar equivalents of compound A or a salt thereof in a diluent, such as DMF, DMSO or a mixture thereof, is then added to the activated vancomycin derivative. After addition of compound A, an amine, such as diisopropylethylamine, is added in an amount ranging from about 2 to about 10 molar equivalents (such as about 5 molar equivalents). The amine is typically added at rate so that the reaction temperature is maintained in the range of about -10 °C to about 5 °C. The reaction mixture is then typically maintained at a temperature in the range of about -10 °C to about 5 °C for about 0.5 to about 3 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. Various peptide coupling reagents can be used in this reaction. Representative examples include benzotriazol-1 -yloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP) with or without l-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt); 0-(6-chloro-1-hydrocibenzotriazol-l-yl)- 1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TCTU); 0-(6-chlorobenzotriazol-1 -yl)-/V,/V,/V’,/V’-tctramcthyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HCTU); OTbcnzotriazol-1 -yl )-Ν,Ν,Ν\N’-tctramcthyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU); 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-l,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium chloride (DMTMM); l-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDCI) with HOAt; diethylcyanophosphonate (DECP) and the like. In one embodiment, the peptide coupling reagent is 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-l,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium chloride. After the coupling reaction is complete, the reaction product is isolated and purified using conventional procedures, such as precipitation and filtration, column chromatography, HPLC and the like. Compound A is known in the art. For example, compound A can be prepared as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,974,797 Β2 (Example A, at column 27, line 51 to column 30, line 56) or in Long et al., J. Antibiot. 61(10): 603-614 (2008) (Cox Synthon 18 at pages 611-612). Procedures for preparing compound A are also described in the Examples. Vancomycin is also known in the art. For example, vancomycin hydrochloride is commercially-available from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO 63103) and from Haorui Pharma-Chem Inc. (Irvine, CA 92618). After preparation, the 26-[[[3-[[(Z)-[l-(2-amino-5-chloro-4-thiazolyl)-2-[[(67?,77?)-2-carboxy-8-oxo-3-(pyridiniomethyl)-5-thia-l-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-7- yl]amino]-2-oxoethylidene]amino]oxy]propyl]amino]carbonyl]-26-decarboxyvancomycin employed in the present invention can be purified using reverse-phase HPLC or other chromatographic methods. For example, the compound can be purified using poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) (PS-DVB) resins. Typically, the PS-DVB resin employed for purifying the compound is a rigid, macroporous type resin having a pore size ranging from about 100 angstroms to about 1,000 angstroms and a particle size ranging from about 10 pm to about 50 pm. A representative resin suitable for use is PLRP-S (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara CA 95051) having a pore size of about 100 angstroms and a particle size of about 50 pm. Generally, the eluent used for the purification comprises an aqueous acidic solution containing varying amounts of a polar organic solvent. Representative polar organic solvents include acetonitrile, ethanol, isopropanol, methanol, and the like. Suitable acids include acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and the like. The eluent may also contain a buffer, such as an acetate buffer or a phosphate buffer. In one embodiment, the eluent comprises an aqueous acetate buffer (100 mM) containing acetonitrile in amounts ranging from about 2 % ν/ν to about 13 % ν/ν. Depending on the purification procedure employed, a salt exchange may be conducted after the purification to provide a hydrochloride salt of the compound. For example, if the acid employed in the purification procedure is an acid other than hydrochloric acid (i.e., acetic acid or trifluoroacetic acid), a salt exchange is typically conducted to form the hydrochloric acid salt. The salt exchange is generally performed using a PS-DVB resin as described herein for the purification. The salt of the compound is typically loaded onto the PS-DVB resin and then the resin is eluted with an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution containing varying amounts of a polar organic solvent. Representative polar organic solvents include acetonitrile, ethanol, isopropanol, methanol, and the like. Generally, the amount of the polar organic solvent employed will range from about 10 % ν/ν to about 80% ν/ν; including about 10 % ν/ν to about 50% ν/ν; such as about 10 % ν/ν to about 20% ν/ν. In one embodiment, the eluent used for the salt exchange comprises about 10 mM aqueous hydrochloric acid containing about 20 % ν/ν acetonitrile. Pharmaceutical Compositions Compounds of formula I are typically administered to a patient in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Such pharmaceutical compositions may contain any acceptable carrier or excipient. The choice of a particular carrier, or combinations of carriers, will depend on various factors, such as the mode of administration, compatibility of the components, stability of the composition, and the like. Conventional techniques for preparing pharmaceutical compositions are known in the art and are described, for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (Remington: The Science & Practice of Pharmacy), Pharmaceutical Press, Philadelphia, PA; 21st Ed. (October 7, 2011). Additionally, conventional ingredients needed for such compositions are commercially-available from, for example, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO 63178, and other commercial suppliers. The pharmaceutical composition is typically prepared by thoroughly and intimately mixing or blending a compound of formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any optional ingredients. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is suitable for parenteral administration, particularly intravenous administration. Such pharmaceutical compositions typically comprise a sterile, physiologically-acceptable aqueous carrier solution containing a compound of formula I. In one embodiment, the composition is pyrogen-free. Optionally, the carrier solution may contain other components, such as sugars, amino acids, electrolytes and the like. Representative physiologically-acceptable aqueous carriers include, by way of example, Sterile Water for Injection, USP; Dextrose Injection, USP (e.g., 2.5, 5.0, 10, 20% dextrose, including 5% Dextrose Injection (D5/W)); Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (e.g., dextrose varying from 2.5 to 10% and sodium chloride varying from 0.12 (19 mEq sodium) to 0.9% (154 mEq sodium)); Mannitol Injection, USP, (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25% mannitol); Ringer’s Injection, USP (e.g., 147 mEq sodium, 4 mEq potassium, 4.5 mEq calcium and 156 mEq chloride per liter); Lactated Ringer's Injection, USP (e.g., 2.7 mEq calcium, 4 mEq potassium, 130 mEq sodium, and 28 mEq lactate per liter); Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (e.g., 0.9% sodium chloride) and the like. When administered to a patient, the compound of formula I will typically be diluted in about 0.5 mL to about 10 mL of the aqueous carrier per mg of the compound of formula I, such as about 0.6 to about 8 mL per mg. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition may be in a solid form suitable for reconstitution and subsequent parenteral administration. Such compositions are typically in the form a sterile, lyophilized composition which is reconstituted prior to use with a sterile, physiologically-acceptable aqueous carrier. In this embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition typically comprises a compound of formula I and a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier. Representative carriers for use in such pharmaceutical compositions include, by way of example, sucrose, mannitol, dextrose, dextran, lactose, glycine or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises (a) a compound of formula I, (b) sucrose and (c) glycine or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof. Such compositions typically contain about 0.5 to about 2.0 parts by weight, including about 1.0 part by weight, of sucrose per part by weight of the compound of formula I (as the free base equivalent); and about 0.5 to about 2.0 parts per weight, including about 1.5 parts per weight, of glycine (as the free base equivalent) per part by weight of the compound of formula I (as the free base equivalent). In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition contains about 1.0 part by weight sucrose and about 1.5 parts per weight of glycine (as the free base equivalent) per part by weight of the compound of formula I (as the free base equivalent). For example, such pharmaceutical compositions may comprise from about 0.5 mg to about 2.0 mg of sucrose and about 1.0 mg to about 2.0 mg of glycine (as the free base equivalent) per milligram of compound of formula I (as the free base equivalent), such as about 1.0 mg of sucrose and about 1.5 mg of glycine (as the free base equivalent) per milligram of compound of formula I (as the free base equivalent). In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises (a) about 10 wt. % to about 60 wt. % of the compound of formula I (free base equivalent); (b) about 10 wt. % to about 60 wt. % of sucrose; and (c) about 10 wt. % to about 80 wt. % of glycine (free base equivalent). For example, this embodiment includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising (a) about 20 wt. % to 50 wt. % of the compound of formula I (free base equivalent); (b) about 20 wt. % to 50 wt. % of sucrose; and (c) about 20 wt. % to about 70 wt. % of glycine (free base equivalent); such as a pharmaceutical composition comprising (a) about 25 wt. % to 35 wt. % of the compound of formula I (free base equivalent); (b) about 25 wt. % to 35 wt. % of sucrose; and (c) about 30 wt. % to about 50 wt. % of glycine (free base equivalent); based on the total weight of the composition. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is a lyophilized powder. Typically, the lyophilized powder is sterile and is packaged in a hermetically-sealed vial or ampoule or similar container. Storage Stability Compounds of formula I have been discovered to have significantly improved storage stability compared to the corresponding trihydrochloride salt. Additionally, the storage stability of compounds of formula I has been found to be further improved in compositions containing sucrose and glycine. The trihydrochloride salt of 26-[[[3-[[(Z)-[l-(2-amino-5-chloro-4-thiazolyl)-2-[[(67?,77?)-2-carboxy-8-oxo-3-(pyridiniomethyl)-5-thia-l-azabicyclo[4.2.0]oct-2-en-7- yl]amino]-2-oxoethylidene]amino]oxy]propyl]amino]carbonyl]-26-decarboxyvancomycin is known in the art. For example, the trihydrochloride salt is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,974,797 Β2 at column 35, lines 16-20. However, upon storage, the purity of the trihydrochloride salt has been found to decrease significantly. For example, when stored at room temperature for 12 months, the trihydrochloride salt has been found to decrease in purity by over 30 % (as shown in FIG. 2). Such degradation is of concern because the degradation products may differ in their biological activity or therapeutic effect compared to the parent molecule. See, for example, J. Diana et al, Journal of Chromatography A, 996:115-131 (2003), which discusses vancomycin impurities. One of the degradation products of the trihydrochloride salt is believed to be a compound of formula II: or a salt thereof. This compound is also referred to as Degradant Β. The compound of formula II is a double-bond isomer in which the double bond in the A-ring of the cephalosporin moiety has isomerized from the A3 position to the A2 position. A2 isomers of cephalosporin acids have been reported to be inactive. See, for example, Crocker et al, J. Chem. Soc. (C), 1142 (1966); and Saab et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 77(10), 906 (1988). Therefore, it is important to minimize the formation of the A2 isomer during storage of the compound. Another degradant is believed to be a hydrolysis product having formula III: or a salt thereof. The compound of formula III is also referred to as Degradant A. It has now been discovered that compounds of formula I are more stable compared to the trihydrochloride salt when stored at room temperature or refrigerated temperature for 12 months. See, for example, FIG. 1 and 2. Additionally, compounds of formula I are more stable at room temperature when they are formulated with sucrose and glycine. See, for example, FIG. 3, 4 and 5. In one embodiment, the change (or decrease) in purity of the compound of formula I in the pharmaceutical composition is less than about 10 % as measured by high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”) after storage for 12 months at a temperature in the range of from about 18 °C to about 25 °C (room temperature). In another embodiment, the area-under-the-curve (AUC) for the compound of formula I decreases by less than about 10 % as determined by high performance liquid chromatography (“HPLC”) after storage of the pharmaceutical composition for 12 months at a temperature in the range of from about 18 °C to about 25 °C (room temperature). In a particular embodiment, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising: (a) a compound of formula I; (b) about 1.0 parts by weight of sucrose; and (c) about 1.5 parts by weight of glycine (as the free base equivalent); wherein the parts by weight of sucrose and glycine are based on the part by weight of the compound of formula I (as the free base equivalent); and wherein change in purity of the compound of formula I in the pharmaceutical composition is less than about 10 % as measured by high performance liquid chromatography after storage for 12 months at a temperature in the range of from about 18 °C to about 25 °C.

See, for example, Leuthner et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.2010, 54(9):3799; Hegde et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.2012, 56(3): 1578; Blais et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.2012, 56(3): 1584; and Tyrell et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.2012, 56(4):2194. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of compounds of formula I against various bacteria and bacterial strains can be determined using standard procedures, such as those published by the Clinical and Laboratories Standards Institute (CLSI) (Wayne, PA 19087). See, for example, CLSI. Methods for Dilution Antimicrobial Susceptibility Tests for Bacteria That Grow Aerobically; Approved Standard - Ninth Edition. CLSI Document Μ07-Α9. Wanye, PA: Clinical and Laboratories Standards Institute; 2012. Compounds of formula I are typically administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any acceptable route of administration. Typically, the compounds are administered parenterally, such as intravenously. The compounds may be administered in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. The treatment regimen may require administration over extended periods of time, for example, for several days or for one to six weeks or longer. The amount of compound administered per dose or the total amount administered will typically be determined by the patient’s physician and will depend on such factors as the nature and severity of the infection, the age and general health of the patient, the tolerance of the patient to the compound, the microorganism(s) causing the infection, the route of administration and the like. Representative doses range from about 0.25 to about 2.5 mg/kg/day of the compound of formula I (free base equivalent), including from about 1 to about 2 mg/kg/day. In one embodiment, the compound of formula I is administered at a dose of about 2 mg/kg/day (free base equivalent). A representative treatment regimen consists of administering a compound of formula I once per day at a dose of about 2 mg/kg/day (free base equivalent) for a period of about 7 to about 14 days. When administered in a physiologically-acceptable aqueous carrier, the compound of formula I is typically administered intravenously to the patient over a period of about 0.5 h to about 2 h, such as for about 1 h. Representative infections or bacteria-related medical conditions that can be treated or prevented with a compound of formula I include, by way of example, infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including skin and skin structure infections, pneumonia, endocarditis, meningitis, sepsis, urinary tract infections, blood stream infections, osteomyelitis, and the like. When treating such conditions, the patient may already be infected with the microorganism to be treated or may be susceptible to infection in which case the antibiotic agent is administered prophylactically.

A DB-624 GC column (30 m length χ 0.53 mm ID χ 3 pm) was used (Agilent, Part No. 125-1334). An internal standard solution was prepared by adding 1 -butanol (4 mL) to a 1 L volumetric flask. DMSO (800 mL) was added and the mixture was mixed thoroughly and then additional DMSO was added to make a total volume of 1L. Each test sample (50 mg) was transferred to a 20 mL headspace vial and the internal standard solution (1 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was agitated vigorously until the sample was dissolved. Reference standards were prepared having a concentration of 2 mg/mL in the internal standard solution from commercially available solvents of known purity. All reference standard solvents were typically combined into one reference standard solution which was prepared in triplicate. For each reference standard replicate, lmL of the solution was added to the 20 mL headspace vial and crimp sealed. The GC analysis conditions are summarized in Table C.

The flask containing the solution of di-/er/-butyl dicarbonate was rinsed with heptane (125 mL) and the rinsate was added to the reaction mixture. The resulting mixture was cooled to a temperature at or slightly below 10 °C and a solution of 3-bromopropylamine hydrobromide (251 g, 1.15 mol) in water (250 mL) was added dropwise at a rate that allowed the internal reaction temperature to be maintained below about 20 °C. The flask containing the solution of 3-bromopropylamine hydrobromide was rinsed with water (20 mL) and the rinsate was added to the reaction mixture. After the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was allowed to slowly warm to room temperature (about 22 °C) and stirring was continued for about 2 h at room temperature. The stirring was discontinued and the mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min. The lower aqueous layer was separated from the organic layer and discarded. To the organic layer was added a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (250 mL) and the resulting mixture was stirred for 5 min. The mixture was allowed to stand for 30 min and the lower aqueous layer was separated and discarded. The organic layer was concentrated to a volume of about 350 mL and this concentrated solution was cooled to 5 °C and stirred for 4 h at 5 °C. The resulting precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration to provide the title compound as a white crystalline solid (211 g, 84% yield). The filtrate was concentrated and the concentrated solution was cooled to 5 °C and stirred for 4 h at 5 °C. The resulting additional precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration to provide an additional amount of the title compound (17 g, 6.8% yield). *H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-rftf) δ *H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-rftf) δ 3.50 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 2Η), 3.03 (q, J = 6.8 Hz, 2Η), 1.91 (m, J = 6.8 Hz, 2Η), 1.38 (s, 9Η).

The resulting solution was heated to 60 °C for 1 h with stirring during which time a precipitate formed. The mixture was then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The precipitate was collected by vacuum fdtration under dry nitrogen, washed with a mixture of heptane and EtOAc (1L, 3:1) and dried under vacuum overnight to give the title compound (770 g, 98.3 % purity).

The resulting mixture was heated at 35 °C for about 8 h. The mixture was then cooled to about -5 °C and trifluoroacetic acid (about 10 mL) was added dropwise until the pH of the mixture was about 6.0. The mixture was then concentrated under vacuum to remove most of the volatile components and absolute ethanol (500 mL) was added. The resulting mixture was concentrated again to remove water via an azeotrope. This procedure was repeated again by adding absolute ethanol (500 mL) followed by concentrating to give the title compound which was used in the next reaction without any further isolation or purification.

A-Chlorosuccinimide (108.0 g, 815 mmol) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h. Water (2.5 L), sodium chloride (514 g) and trifluoroacetic acid (93 mL, 1254 mmol) were added and the resulting mixture was stirred for 15 min. The mixture was allowed to stand for 1 h and then the lower aqueous layer was separated and discarded. The organic layer was concentrated under vacuum to a volume of about 500 mL. Acetonitrile (1.0 L) was added and the mixture was concentrated under vacuum. This was repeated by again adding acetonitrile (1.0 L) and concentrating the mixture under vacuum to a volume of about 600 mL. The mixture was then fdtered through diatomaceous earth (Celite). Triethylamine (350 mL, 2508 mmol) was added and the mixture was cooled to 0 °C at which time a precipitate formed. The precipitate was collected by vacuum fdtration, rinsed with acetonitrile (165 mL), and dried at room temperature under vacuum to give the title compound (224 g, 79% yield) as a light brown crystalline solid.

The resulting mixture was stirred for about 20 min and then fdtered through fdter paper. The filtrate was then added slowly over a 30 min period to ethyl acetate (2.5 L) at room temperature to form a precipitate. The resulting slurry was stirred for about 1 h at room temperature and then the precipitate was collected by filtration under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. The wet cake was washed with ethyl acetate (1 χ 300 mL) and methyl /cvz-butyl ether (1 χ 300 mL), then dried under a stream of dry nitrogen for about 25 min.

Following complete addition of the hydrochloric acid, the reaction mixture was warmed to 10 °C and a mixture of acetonitrile (560.0 mL) and water (92.40 mL) was added. Acetone (1.40 L) was then added to the reaction mixture over a period of about 1 hour and the resulting slurry was stirred for about 30 minutes. The slurry was then fdtered under nitrogen to collect the solid (wet cake). The wet cake was washed with acetone (621.60 mL) and purged with nitrogen until dry. Acetone (621.60 mL) was added to the wet cake and the resulting mixture was stirred to form a slurry and then fdtered under nitrogen to collect the solid which was purged with nitrogen for about 20 minutes. The solid was then dried under vacuum at room temperature for about 18 h to provide the title compound as the trihydrochloride salt (81.9 g, 39.12 mmol, 92.2 % yield).
