COHESIVE LIQUID BOLUS COMPRISING BIOACTIVES FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a cohesive thin liquid bolus comprising an aqueous solution of at least one food grade biopolymer and at least one bioactive compound such as anabolic compounds, anti-catabolic compounds, cell function or neuromuscular junction stimulating compounds and cell energy metabolism stimulating compounds. The invention further relates to the use of said cohesive thin liquid bolus for promoting safer swallowing of food boluses for patients having difficulty in swallowing and to a method for preparing the bolus. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Dysphagia is the medical term for the symptom of difficulty in swallowing. Epidemiological studies estimate a prevalence rate of 16% to 22% among individuals over 50 years of age. Esophageal dysphagia affects a large number of individuals of all ages, but is generally treatable with medications and is considered a less serious form of dysphagia. Esophageal dysphagia is often a consequence of mucosal, mediastinal, or neuromuscular diseases. Mucosal (intrinsic) diseases narrow the lumen through inflammation, fibrosis, or neoplasia associated with various conditions (e.g., peptic stricture secondary to gastroesophageal reflux disease, esophageal rings and webs [e.g., sideropenic dysphagia or Plummer-Vinson syndrome], esophageal tumors, chemical injury [e.g., caustic ingestion, pill esophagitis, sclerotherapy for varices], radiation injury, infectious esophagitis, and eosinophilic esophagitis). Mediastinal (extrinsic) diseases obstruct the esophagus by direct invasion or through lymph node enlargement associated with various conditions (tumors [e.g., lung cancer, lymphoma], infections [e.g., tuberculosis, histoplasmosis], and cardiovascular [dilated auricula and vascular compression]). Neuromuscular diseases may affect the esophageal smooth muscle and its innervation, disrupting peristalsis or lower esophageal sphincter relaxation, or both, commonly associated with various conditions (achalasia [both idiopathic and associated with Chagas disease], scleroderma, other motility disorders, and a consequence of surgery [i.e., after fundoplication and antireflux interventions]). It is also common for individuals with intraluminal foreign bodies to experience acute esophageal dysphagia. Oral pharyngeal dysphagia, on the other hand, is a very serious condition and is generally not treatable with medication. Oral pharyngeal dysphagia also affects individuals of all ages, but is more prevalent in older individuals. Worldwide, oral pharyngeal dysphagia affects approximately 22 million people over the age of 50. Oral pharyngeal dysphagia is often a consequence of an acute event, such as a stroke, brain injury, or surgery for oral or throat cancer. In addition, radiotherapy and chemotherapy may weaken the muscles and degrade the nerves associated with the physiology and nervous innervation of the swallow reflex. It is also common for individuals with progressive neuromuscular diseases, such as Parkinson's Disease, to experience increasing difficulty in swallowing initiation. Representative causes of oropharyngeal dysphagia include those associated neurological illnesses (brainstem tumors, head trauma, stroke, cerebral palsy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, polio, post-polio syndrome, Tardive dyskinesia, metabolic encephalopathies, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, dementia), infectious illnesses (diphtheria, botulism, Lyme disease, syphilis, mucositis [herpetic, cytomegalovirus, Candida, etc.]), autoimmune illnesses (lupus, scleroderma, Sjogren's syndrome), metabolic illnesses (amyloidosis, Cushing's syndrome, thyrotoxicosis, Wilson's disease), myopathic illnesses (connective tissue disease, dermatomyositis, myasthenia gravis, myotonic dystrophy, oculopharyngeal dystrophy, polymyositis, sarcoidosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, inflammatory myopathy), iatrogenic illnesses (medication side effects [e.g., chemotherapy, neuroleptics, etc.], post surgical muscular or neurogenic, radiation therapy, corrosive [pill injury, intentional]), and structural illnesses (cricopharyngeal bar, Zenker's diverticulum, cervical webs, oropharyngeal tumors, osteophytes and skeletal abnormalities, congenital [cleft palate, diverticulae, pouches, etc.]). Dysphagia is not generally diagnosed although the disease has major consequences on patient health and healthcare costs. Individuals with more severe dysphagia generally experience a sensation of impaired passage of food from the mouth to the stomach, occurring immediately after swallowing. Among community dwelling individuals, perceived symptoms may bring patients to see a doctor. Among institutionalized individuals, health care practitioners may observe symptoms or hear comments from the patient or his/her family member suggestive of swallowing impairment and recommend the patient be evaluated by a specialist. As the general awareness of swallowing impairments is low among front-line practitioners, dysphagia often goes undiagnosed and untreated. Yet, through referral to a swallowing specialist (e.g., speech language pathologist), a patient can be clinically evaluated and dysphagia diagnosis can be determined. Severity of dysphagia may vary from: (i) minimal (perceived) difficulty in safely swallowing foods and liquids, (ii) an inability to swallow without significant risk for aspiration or choking, and (iii) a complete inability to swallow. Commonly, the inability to properly swallow foods and liquids may be due to food boluses being broken up into smaller fragments, which may enter the airway or leave unwanted residues in the oropharyngeal and/or esophageal tract during the swallowing process (e.g., aspiration). If enough material enters the lungs, it is possible that the patient may drown on the food/liquid that has built up in the lungs. Even small volumes of aspirated food may lead to bronchopneumonia infection, and chronic aspiration may lead to bronchiectasis and may cause some cases of asthma. "Silent aspiration," a common condition among elderly, refers to the aspiration of oropharyngeal contents such as secretions, food, or liquid due to a lack of pharyngeal reflex in the absence of cough, throat clearance or distress. People may compensate for less-severe swallowing impairments by selflimiting the diet. The aging process itself, coupled with chronic diseases such as hypertension or osteoarthritis, predisposes elderly to (subclinical) dysphagia that may go undiagnosed and untreated until a clinical complication such as pneumonia, dehydration, malnutrition (and related complications) occurs. Pneumonia is a common clinical consequence of dysphagia. The condition often requires acute hospitalization and emergency room visits. Among those that develop pneumonia due to aspiration, the differential diagnosis of 'aspiration pneumonia' is not necessarily indicated as a result of current care practices. Based on U.S. healthcare utilization surveys from recent years, pneumonia accounted for over one million hospital discharges and an additional 392,000 were attributable to aspiration pneumonia. Individuals who have general pneumonia as the principal diagnosis have a mean 6 day hospital length of stay and incur over $18,000 in costs for hospital care. It is expected that aspiration pneumonia would carry higher costs for hospital care, based on a mean 8 day length of hospital stay. Pneumonia is life threatening among persons with dysphagia, the odds of death within 3 months is about 50% (van der Steen et al. 2002). In addition, an acute insult such as pneumonia often initiates the downward spiral in health among elderly. An insult is associated with poor intakes and inactivity, resulting in malnutrition, functional decline, and frailty. Specific interventions (e.g., to promote oral health, help restore normal swallow, or reinforce a swallow-safe bolus) would benefit persons at risk for (due to aspiration of oropharyngeal contents, including silent aspiration) or experiencing recurrent pneumonia. Similar to pneumonia, dehydration is a life-threatening clinical complication of dysphagia. Dehydration is a common co-morbidity among hospitalized individuals with neurodegenerative diseases (thus, likely to have a swallowing impairment). The conditions of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis account for nearly 400,000 U.S. hospital discharges annually, and up to 15% of these patients suffer dehydration. Dehydration as the principal diagnosis is associated with a mean 4 day length of hospital stay and over $11,000 in costs for hospital care. Nevertheless, dehydration is an avoidable clinical complication of dysphagia. Malnutrition and related complications (e.g., [urinary tract] infections, pressure ulcers, increased severity of dysphagia [need for more-restricted food options, tube feeding, and/or PEG placement and reduced quality of life], dehydration, functional decline and related consequences [falls, dementia, frailty, loss of mobility, and loss of autonomy]) can arise when swallowing impairment leads to fear of choking on food and liquids, slowed rate of consumption, and self-limited food choices. If uncorrected, inadequate nutritional intake exacerbates dysphagia as the muscles that help facilitate normal swallow weaken as physiological reserves are depleted. Malnutrition is associated with having a more than 3-times greater risk of infection. Infections are common in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases (thus, likely to have a chronic swallowing impairment that jeopardizes dietary adequacy). The conditions of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis account for nearly 400,000 U.S. hospital discharges annually, and up to 32% of these patients suffer urinary tract infection. Moreover, malnutrition has serious implications for patient recovery. Malnourished patients have longer length of hospital stay, are more likely to be re-hospitalized, and have higher costs for hospital care. Malnutrition as the principal diagnosis is associated with a mean 8 day length of hospital stay and nearly $22,000 in costs for hospital care. Furthermore, malnutrition leads to unintentional loss of weight and predominant loss of muscle and strength, ultimately impairing mobility and the ability to care for oneself. With the loss of functionality, caregiver burden becomes generally more severe, necessitating informal caregivers, then formal caregivers, and then institutionalization. However, malnutrition is an avoidable clinical complication of dysphagia. Among persons with neurodegenerative conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), unintentional weight loss as a marker of malnutrition precedes cognitive decline. In addition, physical activity can help stabilize cognitive health. Thus, it is important to ensure nutritional adequacy among persons with neurodegenerative conditions to help them have the strength and endurance to participate in regular therapeutic exercise and guard against unintentional weight loss, muscle wasting, loss of physical and cognitive functionality, frailty, dementia, and progressive increase in caregiver burden. The economic costs of dysphagia are associated with hospitalization, re-hospitalization, loss of reimbursement due to pay for performance ("P4P"), infections, rehabilitation, loss of work time, clinic visits, use of pharmaceuticals, labor, care taker time, childcare costs, quality of life, increased need for skilled care. Dysphagia and aspiration impact quality of life, morbidity and mortality. Twelve-month mortality is high (45%) among individuals in institutional care who have dysphagia and aspiration. The economic burden of the clinical consequences arising from lack of diagnosis and early management of dysphagia are significant. Considering the prevalence of dysphagia, possible complications related thereto, and the costs associated with same, there is still a need for providing an improved method for treating swallowing disorders, which method can minimize the risk of standard bolus therapy, promotes safer swallowing of food boluses and prevents or treats the clinical complications of dysphagia in patients suffering from aspiration. Such a method would improve the lives of a large and growing number of persons with swallowing impairments. Specific interventions (e.g., to promote oral health, help restore normal swallow, or reinforce a swallow-safe bolus) can enable persons to eat orally (vs. being tube fed and/or requiring PEG placement) and experience the psycho-social aspects of food associated with general well being while guarding against the potentially negative consequences that result from lack of adequate swallowing ability. Improvements in the intake of nutrition by dysphagic patients may also enable such patients to swallow a wider variety of food and beverage products safely and comfortably, which may lead to an overall healthier condition of the patient and prevent further health-related decline. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION These needs are met by the present invention, which provides a novel, nutritionally reinforced, swallow-safe bolus and a method for preparing the same. The bolus of the invention helps to prevent or treat the clinical complications of dysphagia by guarding the patient against unintentional weight loss and muscle wasting, and thus helps to avoid functional decline, loss of physical and cognitive functionality, frailty, and ultimately loss of mobility in patients suffering from a swallowing disorder.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a bolus selected from a cohesive liquid having (i) a shear viscosity of less than about 400 mPas, and (ii) a relaxation time, determined by a Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) experiment, of more than 10 ms (milliseconds) at a temperature of 20°C; the bolus comprising: (1) an aqueous solution of at least one food grade biopolymer selected from the group consisting of botanical hydrocolloids, microbial hydrocolloids, animal hydrocolloids, algae hydrocolloids and any combination thereof; and (2) at least one bioactive compound selected from: (a) Anabolic compounds; (b) Anti-catabolic compounds; (c) Cell function or neuromuscular junction stimulating compounds; and (d) Cell energy metabolism stimulating compounds. Bolus As used herein, term "bolus" refers to a physical portion of a food or beverage that can be swallowed by a patient. Said bolus may be in solid, semi-solid or liquid form and may comprise one or more nutrients, foods or nutritional supplements. Preferably, the bolus is a liquid. It is further preferred that the bolus has a volume the patient can consume in one swallowing event. The preferred volume of the liquid bolus is from 1 to 50 ml, preferably from 5-20 ml, more preferably from 8-12 ml. The present inventors have found that providing to dysphagic patients a bolus having an increased cohesiveness due to its extensional viscosity, as opposed to the effects of shear viscosity, dramatically reduces the amount of swallowing effort for these patients, as well as the risk of residue build-up in the oropharyngeal and/or esophageal tracts. As such, boluses having increased cohesiveness provide improved nutritional intake of dysphagic patients by enabling them to swallow a wider variety of food and beverage products safely and comfortably. This is achieved by improving bolus integrity and thus lending confidence to the patient in being able to consume the different products. The nutritional improvement achieved by an improved food and water intake may lead to an overall healthier condition of the patient and prevent further decline. Therefore, the bolus of the present invention is not only modified with regard to its shear viscosity, but with regard to at least one further rheological property such as its cohesiveness. Shear viscosity is a commonly measured rheological property, which is often referred to as simply viscosity, and which may be determined by any method known in the art. In the present invention, shear viscosity was determined using concentric cylinders in a standard research-grade rheometer (Anton Paar MCR). Said parameter describes the reaction of a material to applied shear stress. In other words, shear viscosity is the ratio between "stress" (force per unit area) exerted on the surface of a fluid, in the lateral or horizontal direction, to the change in velocity of the fluid as you move down in the fluid (a "velocity gradient"). Cohesiveness is a parameter that relates to the ability of a portion of liquid to hold together when being stretched (extended, elongated) in a flow, e.g. passing through a constriction, dewetting of a drop on a surface or thinning of a liquid filament. In the context of the present disclosure, the relaxation time of a bolus as a measure of its cohesiveness was determined by a Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) experiment. The Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometer is an example for a rheometer applying extensional stress. During the CaBER experiment as performed herein for measuring the relaxation time of the bolus, a drop of said bolus is placed between two vertically aligned and parallel circular metal surfaces, both having a diameter of 6 mm. The metal surfaces are then rapidly separated linearly over a time interval of 50 ms (milliseconds). The filament formed by this stretching action subsequently thins under the action of interfacial tension and the thinning process is followed quantitatively using a laser sheet measuring the filament diameter at its mid-point. The relaxation time in a CaBER experiment is determined by plotting the normalized natural logarithm of the filament diameter during the thinning process versus time and determining the slope of the linear portion (din (D/D0)/dt) of this curve, where D is the filament diameter, DO the filament diameter at time zero and t the time of filament thinning. The relaxation time in this context is then defined as minus one third (-1/3) times the inverse of this slope, i.e. -l/(3dln(D/D0)/dt). Preferably, the filament diameter of the bolus decreases less than linearly, and more preferably exponentially in time during a CaBER experiment. In one preferred embodiment, the bolus is a cohesive thin liquid having (i) a shear viscosity of less than about 50 mPas, preferably from 5 to 45 mPas, more preferably from 10 to 40 mPas, and most preferably from 20 to 30 mPas, when measured at a shear rate of 50 s-1; and (ii) a relaxation time, determined by a Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) experiment, of more than 10 ms (milliseconds) at a temperature of 20°C. In another preferred embodiment, the bolus is a cohesive thickened liquid having (i) a shear viscosity of more than about 50 mPas, preferably from 55 to 350 mPas, more preferably from 60 to 200 mPas, and most preferably from 70 to 100 mPas, when measured at a shear rate of 50 s-1; and (ii) a relaxation time, determined by a Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) experiment, of more than 10 ms (milliseconds) at a temperature of 20°C. It is particularly preferred that the cohesive liquid bolus of the invention has a relaxation time of less than about 2000 ms, preferably from about 20 ms to about 1000 ms, more preferably from about 50 ms to about 500 ms, and most preferably from about 100 ms to about 200 ms, at a temperature of 20°C. A further embodiment relates to the cohesive liquid bolus in diluted form, preferably in an aqueous dilution ranging from 2:1 to 50:1, more preferably from 3:1 to 20:1 and most preferably from 5:1 to 10:1. By way of example, a dilution of 2:1 means that 1 part of nutritional product is diluted in 2 parts of water. A further embodiment relates to the cohesive liquid bolus in administrable form, which may preferably selected from the group consisting of a pharmaceutical formulation, a nutritional formulation, a nutritional supplement, a dietary supplement, a functional food, a beverage product, a full meal, a nutritionally complete formula, and combinations thereof. Biopolymers The cohesive liquid bolus of the present invention comprises an aqueous solution of at least one food grade biopolymer selected from the group consisting of botanical hydrocolloids, microbial hydrocolloids, animal hydrocolloids, algae hydrocolloids and any combination thereof. It is preferred that these biopolymers are comprised in the cohesive liquid bolus in a concentration of from at least 0.01 wt% to 25 wt%, preferably from at least 0.1 wt% to 15 wt%, and most preferably from at least 1 wt% to 10 wt%.

In a preferred embodiment, the plant-derived mucilage is kiwi fruit mucilage and/or cactus mucilage. In the context of this disclosure, kiwi fruit mucilage is preferably derived from the stem pith of kiwi fruit, which contains about 20% of mucilage and typically represents the plant waste material remaining from kiwi fruit agriculture. Further in this context, the gums and mucilages are preferably food grade and can be commercially obtained from numerous suppliers. Alternatively, the above gums and mucilages may be obtained by any suitable extraction method known in the art. For example, gums and mucilages may be extracted by a method comprising the steps of soaking the raw plant material with 10 times of its weight of distilled water and keeping it overnight. A viscous solution is obtained, which is passed through a muslin cloth. The gum or mucilage is precipitated by addition of 95% by weight of ethanol in a ratio of about 1:1 by continuous stirring. A coagulated mass is obtained, which is subsequently dried in an oven at 40 to 45°C, powdered by passing through a sieve and stored in an airtight container.
