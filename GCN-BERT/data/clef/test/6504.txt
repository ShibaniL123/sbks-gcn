The present application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application No. 61/408,292 filed on Oct. 29, 2010 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The field of the invention relates to a restricted access media for chromatographic purification and methods of use thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Two classes of chromatography are adsorption chromatography (AC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Reverse and normal phase chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, chiral chromatography are in the class of AC. Separation here is due to different energetic interactions between molecules of the substance undergoing to the chromatographic separation. Another class includes SEC that separates substances according to molecular size (other parameters affecting separation include size of pores in the media, size of the chromatographic column, flow rate, temperature, injection volume and sensitivity of used detector). Separation, using SEC, between molecules having a size difference of at least two fold is usually sufficient. Drug screening frequently requires the separation of protein-ligand complexes from non-bound ligand molecules. The complex may then need to be analyzed. If, however, short or small columns are in use, the SEC separation may be poor. If needed, additional resolution may be affected by adsorption between small molecules and the inner surface of pores of the SEC media. Generally, the interaction increases retention of the small molecules and has no effect on large molecules like proteins if they are not able to penetrate inside the pores. This variety of media is known as “restrictive access media” or RAM. Performance of the RAM is dependable on its design. As a result of using this media, complete and fast separation of protein-ligand complexes and low molecular weight compounds is achieved Known RAM are generally not able to separate protein-ligand complexes from detergents that solubilize proteins such as membrane proteins. Frequently, the required detergent concentration results in formation of micelles comparable in size to the target protein. Existing media do not allow SEC based separation of the micelles from protein-ligand complexes. This drawback causes problems with characterizing the protein-ligand complexes, for example, using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) screening, detergent molecules come into the mass spectrometer (MS) together with the ligands initially bound to target. The detergent molecules then suppress the ligand ionization. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a chromatography resin designed to disperse detergent micelles, effect separation of the individual detergent molecules from target ligand complex, and prevent their interference with MS. The present invention provides a particle (e.g., a silica particle, for example, a silica gel) comprising a diameter of about 5 microns and pores of about 60 angstroms in diameter; wherein the surface of the particle pores is derivatized with aminopropyl groups that are coated with polysuccinamide polymers which polymers are coated with 1-ethylpropylamine and with denatured human serum albumin. Any particle that is derivatized with 1-ethylpropyl amidated polysuccinamide and coated with human serum albumin; that is produced by a process comprising: (1) incubating a support particle comprising aminopropyl groups (e.g., a silica gel particle comprising aminopropyl groups) with 1% polysuccinamide in dimethylformamide; (2) incubating the particle with denatured human serum albumin; and (3) incubating the particle with 1-ethylpropylamine; forms part of the present invention.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES FIG. 1: Schematically shows obtaining the first level of coating of the aminopropyl silica gel by polysuccinamide (PSI). FIG. 2: Demonstrates the molecular weight distribution in the PSI used for the first layer of the coating. FIG. 3: Special Screening Media. Schematically shows drug screening media based on derivatized silica gel with two layers of coating. (1) Polymer, polysuccinamide with broad molecular weight distribution (5,000-700,000 Dalton) was bound to media particles (5μ, 60 A pores); (2) Hydrophilic compound (denaturalized HSA) is bound (immobilized) on the media particles outside the pores; (3) Hydrophilic compound (1-Ethyl propyl amine) is bound to the polymer inside “screen media” pores. FIG. 4: Schematically shows the components of a mixture resulting from the generation of a protein-ligand complex. Complexed molecules (protein with ligand) and free ligand molecules are present. Such molecular species can be resolved using the RAM of the present invention. FIG. 5: Schematically shows the components of a mixture resulting from the generation of a protein-multiligand complex. Complexed molecules (protein with more than one ligand) and free ligand molecules are present. Such molecular species can be resolved using the RAM of the present invention. FIG. 6: Shows chromatograms of different proteins with molecular weight from 20,000 Dalton to 120,000 Dalton and the low molecular weight substance NaNO3. The chromatograms were obtained on a column packed with the RAM of the present invention. This figure demonstrates that the large proteins cannot penetrate inside the RAM pores and therefore have retention volume equal to the void volume of the column. At the same time, the figure demonstrates perfect separation the low molecular weight substance, NaNO3, from the proteins. FIG. 7: Demonstrates separation of human serum albumin (HSA) from NaNO3 on different size columns with an inner diameter of 2.1 mm and a length 50 or 33 mm, packed with the RAM of the present invention using flow rates of 0.3, 0.4 or 0.5 ml/min. The protein peak retention time was 19 seconds for the 50 mm column at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. A complete separation was achieved as well on the 33 mm column at a flow rate of 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 ml/minute. At 0.5 ml/minute the protein retention time is just 9 seconds. Even at this rate and column length, the separation was complete. FIG. 8: Demonstrates separation of human serum albumin (HSA) from low molecular weight (MW) ligands in a library (containing 5,000 compounds of small molecules with MW below 800 Dalton). Different size columns are packed with the RAM of the present invention and used at different flow rates. FIG. 9: schematically shows a reaction mixture of membrane protein and ligands in the presence detergent micelles. The interaction of the various components in the mixture with the RAM of the present invention are indicated. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides, in an embodiment of the invention, a drug screening restrictive access media based on derivatized silica gel. The media allows complete separation small ligand molecules from large protein-ligand complex molecules quickly, e.g., between 10-20 seconds, and the media also efficiently disperses detergent micelles to prevent complication of mass spectrometric analysis of the final protein preparation due to detergent molecules. See, for example, the diagrams in FIGS. 4 and 5. Detergent contamination is particularly problematic for mass spectroscopic analysis of solubilized proteins. Interfering effects of detergent contamination include background ions that obscure the protein signal, suppression of the sample signal, and adduct formation. See for example, FIG. 9 illustrating the components in a composition comprising a detergent-solubilized protein complexed with ligand molecules. The present invention is particular effective at removing detergent micelles from protein-ligand complexes. “Detergent micelles” are aggregates of detergent monomers wherein the nonpolar ends of the monomers are sequestered inward, avoiding exposure to water (in an aqueous environment), and the polar ends are oriented outward in contact with the water. During detergent cell lysis, the detergents penetrate between the cellular membrane bilayers at concentrations sufficient to form mixed micelles with, e.g., phospholipids and membrane proteins. Both the number of detergent monomers per micelle (aggregation number) and the range of detergent concentration above which micelles form (called the critical micelle concentration, CMC) are properties specific to each particular detergent. The CMC is the concentration of a detergent above which micelles are spontaneously formed. Removal of detergent micelles from a system, e.g., by use of the RAM of the present invention, will decrease the micelle concentration around the protein molecules and, thus, improve ligand purity and detection, e.g., by mass spectroscopy. Examples of detergents include, but are not limited to SDS, Cholate, Deoxycholate, C16TAB, LysoPC, CHAPS (3[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate), Zwittergent 3-14, Octylglucoside, Digitonin, C12E8, Lubrol, Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40 and Tween 80. Properties of many common detergents are set forth below in Table 1. The present invention encompasses methods for purifying polypeptides and complexes thereof in a sample that includes a detergent by reducing the detergent micelle concentration in the sample (e.g., to below the CMC) by chromatographic purification of the polypeptide or complex using a RAM of the present invention (e.g., as discussed herein).

A RAM of the present invention is a derivatized gel, such as an aminopropyl silica gel, that is coated by polysuccinamide polymer with a broad molecular weight distribution from about 5,000 Daltons to about 700,000 Daltons to which (1) denatured human serum albumin (HSA) and (2) 1-ethylpropylamine is bound. The arrangement of a RAM of the present invention is as set forth in FIG. 3. In an embodiment of the invention, greater than 90% of the polysuccinamide polymer carbonyl groups are derivatized with human serum albumin and 1-ethylpropylamine (e.g., about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99% or about 100%). In an embodiment of the invention, the polysuccinamide is attached to the support, via the aminopropyl groups, at several points per molecule and/or several points per support particle—this would be an “island” type of coating, as the individual polymer molecules are not cross-linked into a continuous network. Generally, due to molecular size, the denatured HSA does not penetrate inside of the RAM pores due to size and, thus, is covalently attached to the polysuccinamide polymers on the outer surface of the support. In an embodiment of the invention, the denatured HSA is generally restricted to covalent attachment to polysuccinamide polymers on the outer surface of the support. The 1-ethylpropylamine molecules are not restricted from the pores and, thus, are largely located within the pore structure. In an embodiment of the invention, greater than 90% (e.g., about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99% or about 100%) of the denatured HSA is located outside of the pores and greater than 90% (e.g., about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99% or about 100%) of the 1-ethylpropylamine is located inside the pores. In an embodiment of the invention, the pore size of a RAM of the present invention is about 60 angstroms and/or a RAM of the present invention bead size is about 5 microns in diameter. In an embodiment of the invention, polysuccinamide polymers are attached to a support of a RAM of the present invention as set forth below: See also FIG. 1. In an embodiment of the invention, succinamidyl units in a polysuccinamide polymer are derivatized with 1-ethylpropylamine as shown below: In an embodiment of the invention, the polysuccinamide polymers in the RAM of the present invention have a very broad molecular weight distribution, e.g., from about 10 angstroms in diameter to about 100 angstroms in diameter (e.g., about 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100 angstroms). In an embodiment of the invention, denatured human serum albumin is derivatized to the polysuccinamide by condensation between R—C(O)—R′ of the polysuccinamide and R″-NH2 of the polypeptide (e.g., at —NH2 groups of glutamine, asparagine, lysine or arginine residues or at the amino terminus of the polypeptide); yielding RC(O)—NH—R″+H2O. In an embodiment of the invention, the molecular weight distribution of the derivatized polysuccinamide is approximately as set forth in the analysis set forth in FIG. 2. For example, comprising about 35% of the polymer in the range of about 500 kDa to about 700 kDa; about 10% of the polymer in the range of about 50 kDa to about 100 kDa; about 20% of the polymer in the range of about 30 kDa to about 50 kDa; about 10% of the polymer in the range of about 7 kDa to about 30 kDa; and about 25% of the polymer in the range of about 3 kDa to about 7 kDa. Human serum albumin is very well known in the art and commercially available. For example, HSA has the following amino acid sequence: (SEQ ID NO: 1) MKWVTFISLL FLFSSAYSRG VFRR DAHKSE VAHRFKDLGE ENFKALVLIA FAQYLQQCPF EDHVKLVNEV TEFAKTCVAD ESAENCDKSL HTLFGDKLCT VATLRETYGE MADCCAKQEP ERNECFLQHK DDNPNLPRLV RPEVDVMCTA FHDNEETFLK KYLYEIARRH PYFYAPELLF FAKRYKAAFT ECCQAADKAA CLLPKLDELR DEGKASSAKQ RLKCASLQKF GERAFKAWAV ARLSQRFPKA EFAEVSKLVT DLTKVHTECC HGDLLECADD RADLAKYICE NQDSISSKLK ECCEKPLLEK SHCIAEVEND EMPADLPSLA ADFVESKDVC KNYAEAKDVF LGMFLYEYAR RHPDYSVVLL LRLAKTYETT LEKCCAAADP HECYAKVFDE FKPLVEEPQN LIKQNCELFE QLGEYKFQNA LLVRYTKKVP QVSTPTLVEV SRNLGKVGSK CCKHPEAKRM PCAEDYLSVV LNQLCVLHEK TPVSDRVTKC CTESLVNRRP CFSALEVDET YVPKEFNAET FTFHADICTL SEKERQIKKQ TALVELVKHK PKATKEQLKA VMDDFAAFVE KCCKADDKET CFAEEGKKLV AASQAALGL e.g., wherein residues 1-24 are signal peptide and the remaining residues are the mature HSA. Mature or immature denatured HSA can be used in a RAM of the present invention. The “support” can be any material that can be derivatized as discussed herein and which is suitable for size-exclusion chromatographic purification (as discussed herein). In an embodiment of the invention, a support is an inorganic material. Inorganic support materials can include, but are not limited to, silica (e.g., a silica gel), glass, alumina, zirconia, silver, and gold. In an embodiment of the invention, a support is an organic support material. Organic support materials can include, but are not limited to, agarose, dextran, and cellulose. Supports can comprise one or more organic support material(s) and organic polymer supports. Organic support materials and organic polymer supports can include, but are not limited to, polystyrene, polymethacrylate, and polyamide. In other embodiments of the invention, the support can comprise a composite support. Composite supports include, but are not limited to, an agarose coating on quartz, an agarose coating on stainless steel, and coated polystyrene/divinylbenzene. In an embodiment of the invention, the support must be a particle that has a diameter of about 5 microns and/or pores with a diameter of about 60 angstroms. Purification The RAM of the present invention is suitable for purifying a wide range of polypeptides and complexes thereof, for example, a target polypeptide and a small organic molecule ligand (e.g., a natural ligand, an antagonist or an agonist) Typical methods by which a RAM of the present invention may be used to purify a preparation would include the steps of (i) introducing a sample containing a polypeptide or complex thereof to the RAM wherein the media is in a chromatography column. A solvent in which the RAM is suspended can be, in an embodiment of the invention, alcohol (e.g., MeOH), water, aqueous buffer or an organic solvent at a pH of between about 1 and 8. (ii) allowing the sample to pass over the RAM, e.g., under pressure. The temperature can be up to about 60° C. (e.g., 4° C., 10° C., 23° C., 25° C., 37° C., 40° C., 50° C.) and the pressure under which a RAM column of the present invention is run can be up to about 9000 bar (e.g., about 1 bar, about 1000 bar, about 2000 bar, about 3000 bar, about 4000 bar, about 5000 bar, about 6000 bar, about 7000 bar, about 8000 bar); (iii) collecting the flow-through fraction from the end of the column. The flow-through faction and eluted fractions may then be analyzed and/or subject to further purification. For example, other purification steps can include cation exchange chromatography, anion exchange chromatography, further size exclusion chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, hydroxyapatite chromatography, diafiltration, ultrafiltration, precipitation (e.g., urea precipitation), viral filtration or filtration through a membrane, e.g., with pore size of 0.2 microns. Low molecular weight and hydrophobic molecules tend to bind to the polymer inside the pores, and a high molecular weight and hydrophilic molecules tend to bind to the polymer outside the pores. The RAM of the present invention allows fast separation (e.g., about 10-20 sec) of small molecules (e.g., ligands with a molecular weight below about 1000 Dalton) from larger proteins. A chromatography “column” is any vessel which can contain a RAM of the invention which permits the sample to pass through the RAM and, then out of the vessel. In an embodiment of the invention, the column is a generally cylindrical structure. The chromatography column can be, for example, metal (e.g., steel) or plastic. In general, the column must be capable of withstanding high pressure (e.g., 9000 bars). Column dimensions may be, in an embodiment of the invention, 2.1 mm×50 mm or 2.1 mm×33 mm (inner diameter X length). Synthesis The RAM of the present invention can be generated using any suitable means known in the art. In an embodiment of the invention, the RAM is generated by a method comprising: (1) Derivatizing the support with polysuccinamide, for example by incubating the support, e.g., which comprises amino-propyl groups (e.g., silica gel), with polysuccinamide (e.g., 1%) in an organic solvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF), for example at a temperature of about 50° C. Afterward, the support can be washed, e.g., with the solvent (e.g., dimethylformamide) and with a mixture of the solvent (e.g., dimethylformamide) and water. Loading of the amino-propyl groups in the RAM support must be at a rate of about 1.5-1.7 mmol polysuccinamide per gram of support. A 1% polysuccinamide solution in DMF can be prepared by mixing the components in the correct proportions and then rotating the mixture for one day, and then filtering the mixture, e.g., using a “fine” grade of glass fritted funnel. For example, in an embodiment of the invention, a 10% mixture of the support in a solution of 1% polysuccinamide in organic solvent (e.g., DMF) can be made and then incubated, e.g., with rotation e.g., for about 48 hours, e.g., at a temperature of about 50° C. After that, support can be washed, e.g., with the organic solvent (e.g., DMF), the a mixture of solvent:water::2:1 (e.g., DMF:H20::2:1). If the support is to be stored afterward, it may be kept moist with the solvent:H20 mixture. then (2) Binding denatured HSA to the polysuccinamide, for example, by incubating the support with a mixture of denaturing organic solvent (e.g., DMF) and denatured HSA, e.g., at about 50° C. Afterward, the support can be washed with a mixture of the solvent (e.g., DMF) and water and with water. In an embodiment of the invention, a 5 mg/ml solution of HSA in water is initially prepared, e.g., at a temperature of about 50° C. After that, small portions (e.g., a few ml at a time) of a denaturing organic solvent such as DMF is added gradually e.g., at a temperature of about 50° C., with mixing. For example, about 1150 ml of the solvent (e.g., DMF) can be mixed into 500 ml of the HSA in water. In an embodiment of the invention, the HSA solution can be filtered before binding to the support. In an embodiment of the invention, about 50 grams of the support is mixed with the HSA mixture (e.g., about 1650 ml), e.g., with rotation for about 48 hours, e.g., at about 50° C. After coating, the resin can be washed, for example, with a solvent:water mixture (DMF:H20), then with H20 and then with solvent (e.g., DMF); e.g., all at about 50° C. then (3) Binding 1-ethylpropylamine to the HSA, for example, by incubating the gel with 1-ethyl propyl amine in organic solvent (e.g., DMF), e.g., at about 50° C., then washing the gel in the solvent (e.g., DMF), in water and in alcohol such as methanol; In an embodiment of the invention, a 2/7 dilution of 1-ethylpropylamine is diluted with organic solvent such as DMF and the HSA coated support resin is added to this mixture; e.g., wherein 200 ml of the 1-ethylpropylamine is diluted with 500 ml of DMF and the 700 ml of solution is added to about 50 grams of the HSA coated support. The mixture may then be placed into vessel and rotated for e.g., about 36 hours, e.g., at about 50° C. The 1-ethylpropylamine coated resin may be was washed, e.g., with organic solvent, water, then alcohol, e.g., 1000 ml of solvent (e.g., DMF), 1000 ml of water and finally with 500 ml of MeOH. The scope of the present invention encompasses any RAM produced by a method as set forth herein. Furthermore, the methods themselves that are discussed herein for making a RAM of the present invention are part of the present invention. Screening Assays The RAM of the present invention may be used to identify ligands that bind to a given target protein. For example, a mixture of the target and a mass encoded library may be equilibrated before adding to a size exclusion column containing the RAM of the present invention. As the mixture moves through the size exclusion column, ligand, target and target/ligand complexes separate; wherein, the complexes elute earlier than the ligand and target alone. The complexes are then, optionally, further fractionated, e.g., through a reverse phase chromatography column; wherein the complexes are further purified. In an embodiment of the invention, the ligand and the target protein are dissociated on the reverse phase chromatography column and the ligand is collected. The ligands are analyzed by mass spectrometry to determine their identity. A mass encoded library is a library comprising ligands whose molecular masses are known. Thus, the identity of a ligand in the library can be divined by determining its mass. In an embodiment of the invention, the size exclusion column is about 2.1 mm in diameter and/or about 50 mm in length. In an embodiment of the invention, the buffer in which the size exclusion column is run is aqueous ammonium acetate buffer at a pH of about 7 to about 8; and/or at a concentration of about 700 mM to about 1 M. In an embodiment of the invention, the size exclusion column is run at about 0.4 ml per minute. In an embodiment of the invention, the size exclusion column is run at about 4° C. In an embodiment of the invention, the reverse phase chromatography column is run with a buffer gradient of from about 100% water to about 100% of a mixture of acetonitrile and 0.2% formic acid. In an embodiment of the invention, the column pH is about 2 to about 3. EXAMPLES The present invention is intended to exemplify the present invention and not to be a limitation thereof. Any method or composition disclosed below falls within the scope of the present invention. Example 1 Generation of the RAM and Column Packing Procedure Preparation of PSI Solution.
