RELATED APPLICATIONS The instant application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/983,152, filed Apr. 23, 2014, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides specific TRAIL receptor agonist proteins comprising three soluble TRAIL domains and an Fc fragment, nucleic acid molecules encoding the TRAIL receptor agonist proteins, and uses thereof. The TRAIL receptor agonist proteins are substantially non-aggregating and suitable for therapeutic, diagnostic and/or research applications. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is known that trimerization of TNF superfamily (TNFSF) cytokines is required for efficient receptor binding and activation. Trimeric complexes of TNF superfamily cytokines, however, are difficult to prepare from recombinant monomeric units. WO 01/49866 and WO 02/09055 disclose recombinant fusion proteins comprising a TNF cytokine and a multimerization component, particularly a protein from the C1q protein family or a collectin. A disadvantage of these fusion proteins is, however, that the trimerization domain usually has a large molecular weight and/or that the trimerization is rather inefficient. Schneider et al. (J Exp Med 187 (1989), 1205-1213) describe that trimers of TNF cytokines are stabilized by N-terminally positioned stabilization motifs. In CD95L, the stabilization of the receptor binding domain trimer is presumably caused by N-terminal amino acid domains which are located near the cytoplasmic membrane. Shiraishi et al. (Biochem Biophys Res Commun 322 (2004), 197-202) describe that the receptor binding domain of CD95L may be stabilized by N-terminally positioned artificial α-helical coiled-coil (leucine zipper) motifs. It was found, however, that the orientation of the polypeptide chains to each other, e.g. parallel or antiparallel orientation, can hardly be predicted. Further, the optimal number of heptad-repeats in the coiled-coil zipper motif are difficult to determine. In addition, coiled-coil structures have the tendency to form macromolecular aggregates after alteration of pH and/or ionic strength. WO 01/25277 relates to single-chain oligomeric polypeptides which bind to an extracellular ligand binding domain of a cellular receptor, wherein the polypeptide comprises at least three receptor binding sites of which at least one is capable of binding to a ligand binding domain of the cellular receptor and at least one is incapable of effectively binding to a ligand binding domain of the cellular receptor, whereby the single-chain oligomeric polypeptides are capable of binding to the receptor, but incapable of activating the receptor. For example, the monomers are derived from cytokine ligands of the TNF family, particularly from TNF-α. WO 2005/103077 discloses single-chain fusion polypeptides comprising at least three monomers of a TNF family ligand member and at least two peptide linkers that link the monomers of the TNF ligand family members to one another. Recent experiments, however, have shown that these single-chain fusion polypeptides show undesired aggregation. WO 2010/010051 discloses single-chain fusion polypeptides comprising three soluble TNF family cytokine domains and at least two peptide linkers. The described fusion polypeptides are substantially non-aggregating. Moreover, previous work, including that of Papadopoulos et al. (Cancer Chemother Pharmacol, 2015, DOI 10.1007/s00280-015-2712-0), has demonstrated that TRAIL receptor superclustering can result in toxicity. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for novel TRAIL receptor agonists that exhibit high biological activity, high stability, low toxicity, and allow for efficient recombinant manufacturing.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, it was found that fusing a single-chain TRAIL receptor-binding domain to an Fc domain results in a hexavalent TRAIL receptor agonist providing high biological activity combined with good stability. Accordingly, a single-chain fusion polypeptide comprising at least three soluble TRAIL domains connected by two peptide linkers and N-terminally and/or C-terminally an antibody Fc fragment, is provided. Preferably, the single-chain fusion polypeptide is non-aggregating. The term “non-aggregating” refers to a monomer content of the preparation of ≧50%, preferably ≧70% and more preferably ≧90%. The ratio of monomer content to aggregate content may be determined by examining the amount of aggregate formation using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The stability concerning aggregation may be determined by SEC after defined time periods, e.g. from a few to several days, to weeks and months under different storage conditions, e.g. at 4° C. or 25° C. For the fusion protein, in order to be classified as substantially non-aggregating, it is preferred that the monomer content is as defined above after a time period of several days, e.g. 10 days, more preferably after several weeks, e.g. 2, 3 or 4 weeks, and most preferably after several months, e.g. 2 or 3 months of storage at 4° C., or 25° C. The single-chain fusion polypeptide may comprise additional domains which may be located at the N- and/or C-termini thereof. Examples for additional fusion domains are e.g. an N-terminal signal peptide domain which may comprise a protease cleave site or a C-terminal element which may comprise and/or connect to a recognition/purification domain. According to a preferred embodiment, the fusion polypeptide comprises a Strep-tag at its C-terminus that is fused via a linker. An exemplary Strep-tag including a short serine linker is shown in SEQ ID NO: 13. The TRAIL receptor agonist protein of the present invention comprises three soluble domains derived from TRAIL. Preferably, those soluble domains are derived from a mammalian, particularly human TRAIL including allelic variants and/or derivatives thereof. The soluble domains comprise the extracellular portion of TRAIL including the receptor binding domain without membrane located domains. Like other proteins of the TNF superfamily, TRAIL is anchored to the membrane via an N-terminal portion of 15-30 amino acids, the so-called stalk-region. The stalk region contributes to trimerization and provides a certain distance to the cell membrane. However, the stalk region is not part of the receptor binding domain (RBD). Importantly, the RBD is characterized by a particular localization of its N- and C-terminal amino acids. Said amino acids are immediately adjacent and are located centrally to the axis of the trimer. The first N-terminal amino acids of the RBD form an anti-parallel beta-strand with the C-terminal amino acids of the RBD (FIGS. 2 and 3). Thus, the anti-parallel beta-strand of the RBD forms an interface with the cell membrane, which is connected to and anchored within the cell membrane via the amino acids of the stalk region. It is highly preferred that the soluble TRAIL domains of the TRAIL receptor agonist protein comprise a receptor binding domain of the TRAIL lacking any amino acids from the stalk region (FIGS. 4 and 5). Otherwise, a long linker connecting the C-terminus of one of the soluble domains with the N-terminus of the next soluble domain would be required to compensate for the N-terminal stalk-region of the next soluble domain (FIG. 6), which might result in instability and/or formation of aggregates. A further advantage of such soluble domains is that the N- and C-terminal amino acids of the RBD are not accessible for any anti-drug antibodies. Preferably, the single-chain fusion polypeptide is capable of forming an ordered trimeric structure comprising at least one functional binding site for the respective TRAIL receptor. The TRAIL receptor agonist protein comprises three functional TRAIL receptor binding sites, i.e. amino acid sequences capable of forming a complex with a TRAIL receptor. Thus, the soluble domains are capable of binding to the corresponding TRAIL receptor. In one embodiment, at least one of the soluble domains is capable of receptor activation, whereby apoptotic and/or proliferative activity may be affected. In a further embodiment, one or more of the soluble domains are selected as not being capable of receptor activation. The soluble TRAIL domain may be derived from human TRAIL as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1. Preferably, the soluble TRAIL domains are derived from human TRAIL, particularly starting from amino acids 120-122 and comprise particularly amino acids 120-281, 121-281 or 122-281 of SEQ ID NO: 1. Optionally, amino acid Arg121 of SEQ ID NO: 1 may be replaced by a non-charged amino acid, e.g. Ser or Gly.

It should be noted, however, that it is possible to introduce mutations in one or more of these soluble domains, e.g. mutations which alter (e.g. increase or decrease) the binding properties of the soluble domains. In one embodiment, soluble domains may be selected which cannot bind to the corresponding cytokine receptor. In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the soluble TRAIL domain (i) comprises a mutant of TRAIL or a receptor binding domain thereof which binds and/or activates TRAIL-receptor 1 (TRAILR1) and/or TRAIL-receptor 2 (TRAILR2). The binding and/or activity of the mutant may be, e.g., determined by the assays as described in van der Sloot et al. (PNAS, 2006, 103:8634-8639), Kelley et al. (J. Biol. Chem., 2005, 280:2205-2215), or MacFarlane et al. (Cancer Res., 2005, 65: 11265-11270). The mutant may be generated by any technique and is known by the skilled person, e.g., the techniques described in van der Sloot et al. (PNAS, 2006, 103:8634-8639), Kelley et al. (J. Biol. Chem., 2005, 280:2205-2215), or MacFarlane et al. (Cancer Res., 2005, 65: 11265-11270) and may comprise any type of structural mutations, e.g., substitution, deletion, duplication and/or insertion of an amino acid. A preferred embodiment is the generation of substitutions. The substitution may affect at least one amino acid of TRAIL or a receptor binding domain thereof as described herein. In a preferred embodiment, the substitution may affect at least one of the amino acids of TRAIL, e.g., human TRAIL (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1). Preferred substitutions in this regard affect at least one of the following amino acids of human TRAIL of SEQ ID NO: 1: R130, G160, Y189, R191, Q193, E195, N199, K201, Y213, T214, S215, H264, I266, D267, D269. Preferred amino acid substitutions of human TRAIL of SEQ ID NO:1 are at least one of the following substitutions: R130E, G160M, Y189A, Y189Q, R191 K, Q193S, Q193R, E195R, N199V, N199R, K201R, Y213W, T214R, S215D, H264R, I266L, D267Q, D269H, D269R, or D269K. The amino acid substitution(s) may affect the binding and/or activity of TRAIL, e.g., human TRAIL, to or on either the TRAILR1 or the TRAILR2. Alternatively, the amino acid substitution(s) may affect the binding and/or activity of TRAIL, e.g., human TRAIL, to or on both, the TRAILR1 and the TRAILR2. The binding and/or activity of the TRAILR1 and/or TRAILR2 may be affected positively, i.e., stronger, more selective or more specific binding and/or more activation of the receptor. Alternatively, the binding and/or activity of the TRAILR1 and/or TRAILR2 may be affected negatively, i.e., weaker, less selective or less specific binding and/or less or no activation of the receptor. Examples of mutants of TRAIL with amino acid substitution(s) of the invention that affect binding and/or activation of both TRAILR1 and TRAILR2 may be found, e.g., in Table 1 of MacFarlane et al. (cf. above) and may comprise a human TRAIL mutant with the following two amino acid substitutions of SEQ ID NO: 1 Y213W and S215D or with the following single amino acid substitution: Y189A.

Examples of mutants of TRAIL with amino acid substitution(s) of the invention that affect binding and/or activation of TRAILR2 may be found, e.g., in Table 1 of MacFarlane et al. (cf. above) or in Table 2 of Kelley et al. (cf. above) and may comprise a human TRAIL mutant with the following six amino acid substitutions of SEQ ID NO: 1: Y189Q, R191 K, Q193R, H264R, I266L, and D267Q, or may be found in Table 2 of van der Sloot et al. (cf. above) and may comprise a human TRAIL mutant with the following single amino acid substitution: D269H, or with the following two amino acid substitutions: D269H and E195R or D269H and T214R. Thus one preferred embodiment is a TRAIL receptor agonist protein as described herein wherein at least one of the soluble domains comprises a mutant of TRAIL or of a receptor binding domain thereof which binds and/or activates TRAILR1 and/or TRAILR2. Further examples of mutants of TRAIL, which show reduced TRAIL induced receptor aggregation are H168 (S, T, Q), R170 (E, S, T, Q) and H177 (S, T).

Such an amino acid substitution is at least one of the following: R13OE, G16OM, H168 (S, T, Q), R170 (E, S, T, Q), H177 (SJ)1 Y189A, Y189Q, R191K, Q193S, Q193R, E195R, N199V, N199R, K201R, Y213W, T214R, S215D, H264R, I266L, D267Q, D269H, D269R, or D269K.

A preferred TRAIL-R1 selective domain comprises amino acid substitutions Y189A, Q193S, N199V, K201R, Y213W and S215D. The single-chain fusion molecule of the present invention comprises three soluble TRAIL domains, namely components (i), (iii) and (v). The stability of a single-chain TRAIL fusion polypeptide against aggregation is enhanced, if the second and/or third soluble TRAIL domain is an N-terminally shortened domain which optionally comprises amino acid sequence mutations. Thus, preferably, both the second and the third soluble TRAIL domain are N-terminally shortened domains which optionally comprise amino acid sequence mutations in the N-terminal regions, preferably within the first five amino acids of the N-terminus of the soluble TRAIL domain. These mutations may comprise replacement of charged, e.g. acidic or basic amino acids, by neutral amino acids, particularly serine or glycine. In contrast thereto, the selection of the first soluble TRAIL domain is not as critical. Here, a soluble domain having a full-length N-terminal sequence may be used. It should be noted, however, that also the first soluble TRAIL domain may have an N-terminally shortened and optionally mutated sequence. In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the soluble TRAIL domains (i), (iii) and (v) are soluble human TRAIL domains. The first soluble TRAIL domain (i) may be selected from native, shortened and/or mutated sequences. Thus, the first soluble TRAIL domain (i) has an N-terminal sequence which may start between amino acid Glu116 and Val122 of human TRAIL, and wherein Arg121 may be replaced by a neutral amino acid, e.g. by Ser or Gly. The second and third soluble TRAIL domains (iii) and (v) have a shortened N-terminal sequence which preferably starts between amino acid Gln120 and Val122 of human TRAIL and wherein Arg121 may be replaced by another amino acid, e.g. Ser or Gly. Preferably, the N-terminal sequence of the soluble TRAIL domains (iii) and (v) is selected from: (a) Arg121-Val122-Ala123 and(b) (Gly/Ser) 121. The soluble TRAIL domain preferably ends with amino acid Gly281 of human TRAIL. In certain embodiments, the TRAIL domain may comprise internal mutations as described above. Components (ii) and (iv) of the TRAIL receptor agonist protein are peptide linker elements located between components (i) and (iii) or (iii) and (v), respectively. The flexible linker elements have a length of 3-8 amino acids, particularly a length of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 amino acids. The linker elements are preferably glycine/serine linkers, i.e. peptide linkers substantially consisting of the amino acids glycine and serine. In cases in which the soluble cytokine domain terminates with S or G (C-terminus), e.g. human TRAIL, the linker starts after S or G. In cases in which the soluble cytokine domain starts with S or G (N-terminus), the linker ends before this S or G. It should be noted that linker (ii) and linker (iv) do not need to be of the same length. In order to decrease potential immunogenicity, it may be preferred to use shorter linkers. In addition it turned out that shorter linkers lead to single chain molecules with reduced tendency to form aggregates. Whereas linkers that are substantially longer than the ones disclosed here may exhibit unfavorable aggregations properties. If desired, the linker may comprise an asparagine residue which may form a glycosylate site Asn-Xaa-Ser. In certain embodiments, one of the linkers, e.g. linker (ii) or linker (iv) comprises a glycosylation site. In other embodiments, both linkers (iv) comprise glycosylation sites. In order to increase the solubility of the sc TRAIL proteins and/or in order to reduce the potential immunogenicity, it may be preferred that linker (ii) or linker (iv) or both comprise a glycosylation site. Preferred linker sequences are selected from GSGSGSGS (SEQ ID NO: 3), GSGSGNGS (SEQ ID NO: 2), GGSGSGSG (SEQ ID NO: 4), GGSGSG (SEQ ID NO: 5), GGSG (SEQ ID NO: 6), GGSGNGSG (SEQ ID NO: 7), GGNGSGSG (SEQ ID NO: 8), GGNGSG (SEQ ID NO: 9), and GSGS (SEQ ID NO: 23). According to a most preferred embodiment, the linker sequences are each GSGSGNGS according to SEQ ID NO: 2. Example linker sequences are shown in Table 2.

Preferably, the antibody Fc fragment domain comprises or consists of an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 10. Alternatively, the Fc fragment domain comprises or consists of an amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 17. Example Fc fragment domains are shown in Table 3.

Further, carbohydrate recognition depends on local density of the terminal saccharides, the branching of the carbohydrate tree and the relative position of the carbohydrates matter. Depletion of CH2-domain carbohydrates is necessary in order to avoid Fc-receptor based crosslinking in vivo and potential TRAIL-receptor superclustering-based toxicity. Further, partially degraded carbohydrates reduce the in vivo half-life of TRAIL receptor agonist proteins through lectin-driven mechanisms. By reducing the total number of glycosylation sites on the molecule, the resulting compound is less accessible to these mechanisms, increasing half-life. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the overall number of glycosites on the TRAIL receptor agonist proteins of the instant invention was reduced through the depletion of CH2 glycosites, resulting in TRAIL receptor agonist proteins comprising N297S equivalent mutations (according to the EU numbering system) creating aglycosl-CH2 domains. CH2-glycosites present on the inner surface areas normally shield the subdomain from proteases during “open Fc-conformation transits” wherein hinge-interchain disulfide bonds are reduced and the covalent interchain linkage is disrupted. This enables CH2-dissociation and exposure of the inner surface area towards proteases. TRAIL receptor agonist proteins comprising an N297S equivalent mutation (according to the EU numbering system) creating an aglycosl-CH2 are therefore likely to be less proteolytically stable that equivalent structures with wild-type CH2 glycosylation. This would impact the compound's stability during USP/DSP/storage, where host cell proteases are present and have long-term access to the structure. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the TRAIL receptor agonist lacks CH2 glycosites, but comprises glycosites in the linker sequences of each polypeptide chain (e.g., GSGSGNGS according to SEQ ID NO: 2). In certain exemplary embodiments, the TRAIL receptor agonist comprises two glycosites per polypeptide chain, for a total of four glycosites, According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the antibody Fc fragment domain is fused via a hinge-linker element. The hinge-linker element has a length of 10-30 amino acids, particularly a length of 15-25 amino acids, e.g. 22 amino acids. The hinge-linker element preferably comprises the hinge-region sequence of an immunoglobulin, herein referred to as “Ig hinge-region”. The term “Ig hinge-region” means any polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence that shares sequence identity or similarity with a portion of a naturally occurring Ig hinge-region sequence which includes the cysteine residues at which the disulfide bonds link the two heavy chains of the immunoglobulin. Derivatives and analogues of the hinge-region can be obtained by mutations. A derivative or analogue as referred to herein is a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence that shares sequence identity or similarity with the full length sequence of the wild type (or naturally occurring protein) except that it has one or more amino acid sequence differences attributable to a deletion, insertion and/or substitution. According to the present invention, however, the term “hinge-linker” is not limited to those linkers comprising an Ig hinge-region or a derivative thereof, but any linkers long enough to allow the domains attached by the hinge-linker element to attain a biologically active confirmation. The number of molecules with open Fc-conformation in an individual TRAIL receptor agonist protein depends on the number of interchain-disulfide bonds present in the hinge region. Accordingly, in one embodiment a third cysteine was introduced into the hinge region of the TRAIL receptor agonist proteins of the instant invention in order to ameliorate the effect of depleting the CH2-glycosites. Further, the TRAIL receptor agonist proteins of the invention additionally comprise mutation of the upper-hinge lysine to a glycine to reduce proteolytic processing at this site. A particularly preferred hinge-linker element comprises or consists of the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 11 (Table 4). The TRAIL receptor agonist protein may additionally comprise an N-terminal signal peptide domain, which allows processing, e.g. extracellular secretion, in a suitable host cell. Preferably, the N-terminal signal peptide domain comprises a protease cleavage site, e.g. a signal peptidase cleavage site and thus may be removed after or during expression to obtain the mature protein. A particularly preferred N-terminal signal peptide domain comprises the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 12 (Table 4). Further, the TRAIL receptor agonist protein may additionally comprise a C-terminal element, having a length of e.g. 1-50, preferably 10-30 amino acids which may include or connect to a recognition/purification domain, e.g. a FLAG domain, a Strep-tag or Strep-tag II domain and/or a poly-His domain. According to a particularly preferred embodiment, the fusion polypeptide comprises a Strep-tag fused to the C-terminus via a short serine linker as shown in SEQ ID NO: 13 (Table 4). An exemplary hinge-linker element, N-terminal signal peptide domain, and short serine linker are shown in Table 4. TABLE 4 Exemplary domains and linkers SEQ ID NO Sequence 11 GPGSSSSSSSGSCDKTHTCPPC 12 METDTLLVFVLLVWVPAGNG 13 SSSSSSAWSHPQFEK 25 GPGSSSSSSGSCDKTHTCPPC According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the fusion polypeptide comprises three soluble TRAIL domains fused by peptide linker elements of SEQ ID NO: 2. The first soluble TRAIL domain (i) consists of amino acids 120-281 of human TRAIL according to SEQ ID NO: 1 and the soluble TRAIL domains (iii) and (v) consist of amino acids 121-281 of human TRAIL according to SEQ ID NO: 1. Additionally, the fusion polypeptide comprises an antibody Fc fragment domain according to SEQ ID NO: 10 that is fused C-terminally to the soluble TRAIL domain (v) via a hinge-linker according to SEQ ID NO: 11. The inventors surprisingly found that this particular fusion polypeptide provides improved biological activity and is particularly stable. The amino acid sequence of an exemplary embodiment of a TRAIL receptor agonist protein of the invention is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 19. Further, the fusion polypeptide may comprise an N-terminal signal peptide domain e.g. according to SEQ ID NO: 12. A specific example of a TRAIL receptor agonist protein of the invention is shown in SEQ ID NO: 14. According to another preferred embodiment, the fusion polypeptide may additionally comprise a C-terminal Strep-tag that is fused to the polypeptide of the invention via a short serine linker as shown in SEQ ID NO: 13. According to this aspect of the invention, the Fc fragment preferably consists of the amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 10 or 17. Further, the Fc fragment may consist of a shorter Fc fragment, for example including amino acids 1-217 of SEQ ID NO: 10. Particularly preferred examples of fusion polypeptides comprising a C-terminal Strep-tag are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 15 and 18. The exemplary TRAIL receptor agonist proteins as shown in SEQ ID NOs: 14, 15 and 18 each comprise an N-terminal signal peptide domain. The signal peptide domain includes amino acids 1-20. In each case, the mature protein starts with amino acid 21. Mature exemplary TRAIL receptor agonist proteins of the instant invention are set forth in SEQ ID NO: 19, 20, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, and 30. Exemplary TRAIL receptor agonist proteins described above are shown in Table 5. The TRAIL receptor agonist as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 19 has a reduced total number of glycosylation sites (the N297S mutation in the CH2 region providing an aglycosylated CH2 domain), an increased number of inter-chain disulfide bonds in the hinge region, and the mutation of an upper-hinge lysine to a glycine. These alterations provide a decrease in potential degradation and TRAIL receptor superclustering (along with concomitant toxicity) while increasing the half-life of the molecule. In some embodiments, the N-terminal glutamine is modified to pyroglutamate (Liu et al. 2011, J. Biol. Chem. 286:11211-11217).

acid molecule encoding a TRAIL receptor agonist protein as described herein. The nucleic acid molecule may be a DNA molecule, e.g. a double-stranded or single-stranded DNA molecule, or an RNA molecule. The nucleic acid molecule may encode the TRAIL receptor agonist protein or a precursor thereof, e.g. a pro- or pre-proform of the TRAIL receptor agonist protein which may comprise a signal sequence or other heterologous amino acid portions for secretion or purification which are preferably located at the N- and/or C-terminus of the TRAIL receptor agonist protein.

When two or more substances or principles are to be used as part of a combined treatment regimen, they can be administered via the same route of administration or via different routes of administration, at essentially the same time or at different times (e.g. essentially simultaneously, consecutively, or according to an alternating regime). When the substances or principles are to be administered simultaneously via the same route of administration, they may be administered as different pharmaceutical formulations or compositions or part of a combined pharmaceutical formulation or composition, as will be clear to the skilled person. Also, when two or more active substances or principles are to be used as part of a combined treatment regimen, each of the substances or principles may be administered in the same amount and according to the same regimen as used when the compound or principle is used on its own, and such combined use may or may not lead to a synergistic effect. However, when the combined use of the two or more active substances or principles leads to a synergistic effect, it may also be possible to reduce the amount of one, more than one, or all of the substances or principles to be administered, while still achieving the desired therapeutic action. This may, e.g., be useful for avoiding, limiting or reducing any unwanted side-effects that are associated with the use of one or more of the substances or principles when they are used in their usual amounts, while still obtaining the desired pharmaceutical or therapeutic effect. The effectiveness of the treatment regimen used according to the invention may be determined and/or followed in any manner known per se for the disease or disorder involved, as will be clear to the clinician. The clinician will also be able, where appropriate and on a case-by-case basis, to change or modify a particular treatment regimen, so as to achieve the desired therapeutic effect, to avoid, limit or reduce unwanted side-effects, and/or to achieve an appropriate balance between achieving the desired therapeutic effect on the one hand and avoiding, limiting or reducing undesired side effects on the other hand. Generally, the treatment regimen will be followed until the desired therapeutic effect is achieved and/or for as long as the desired therapeutic effect is to be maintained. Again, this can be determined by the clinician.

In an embodiment, the TRAIL receptor agonist protein is present in the formulation at a concentration of about 0.1-100 mg/ml, (e.g., about 1-100 mg/ml, or about 1-15 mg/ml, or about 1-7.5 mg/ml, or about 2.5-7.5 mg/ml, or about 5-7.5 mg/ml, or about 25-100 mg/ml, or about 20-60 mg/ml, or about 25-50 mg/ml, or about 25 mg/ml, or about 50 mg/ml, or about 0.1-60 mg/ml, or about 0.1-25 mg/ml, or about 1.0-60 mg/ml, or about 0.5-60 mg/ml, or about 0.1-2.0 mg/ml, or about 0.5-2.0 mg/ml, or about 1-5 mg/ml, or about 1-7.5 mg/ml, or about 1-15 mg/ml, or about 0.5 mg/ml, or about 1.0 mg/m). As used herein, the phrase “effective amount” means an amount of TRAIL agonist protein that results in a detectable improvement (e.g., at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, or more from baseline) in one or more parameters associated with a dysfunction of TRAIL or with a TRAIL-associated disease or disorder. In various embodiments, the pharmaceutical formulation is an aqueous formulation, a lyophilized formulation, or a lyophilized and rehydrated formulation. In an embodiment, the hydrating solution is dextrose and/or saline (e.g., dextrose at a concentration of about 5% w/v and/or the saline at a concentration of about 0.9% w/v). In an embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulation comprises about 15 mM histidine, about 0.03% (w/v) polysorbate 80, about 4% (w/v) sucrose, and about 0.1-25 mg/ml of the TRAIL receptor agonist protein, or about 1-15 mg/ml of TRAIL receptor agonist protein, and is at a pH of about 6. In an embodiment, the formulation further comprises at least one additional agent. In various embodiments, a formulation is used containing about 25 mg/ml TRAIL receptor agonist protein, about 15 mM histidine, 0.03% polysorbate 80 (weight/volume, w/v), 4.0% sucrose (w/v), and a pH of about 6.0. In some embodiments, the formulation does not comprise arginine. In some embodiments, the formulation exhibits unexpectedly improved freeze-thaw stability, liquid formulation stability, and/or lyophilized formulation stability, as compared to other formulations comprising other components or concentrations. Methods of administering a therapeutic agent provided herein include, but are not limited to, oral administration, parenteral administration (e.g., intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous and subcutaneous), epidural administration, intratumoral administration, mucosal administration (e.g., intranasal and oral routes) and pulmonary administration (e.g., aerosolized compounds administered with an inhaler or nebulizer). The formulation of pharmaceutical compositions for specific routes of administration, and the materials and techniques necessary for the various methods of administration are available and known to one skilled in the art (U.S. Patent Publication No. 20090311253 A1). In various embodiments, dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide for an optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. In some embodiments, parenteral compositions are formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The term “dosage unit form” refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. An exemplary, non-limiting range for a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a TRAIL receptor agonist protein provided herein is about 0.1-100 mg/kg, (e.g., about 0.1-0.5, 0.1-1, 0.1-10, 0.1-20, 0.1-50, 0.1-75, 1-10, 1-15, 1-7.5, 1.25-15, 1.25-7.5, 2.5-7.5, 2.5-15, 5-15, 5-7.5, 1-20, 1-50, 7-75, 1-100, 5-10, 5-15, 5-20, 5-25, 5-50, 5-75, 10-20, 10-50, 10-75, or 10-100 mg/kg, or any concentration in between).

In those cases, where a plurality of polypeptide chains is necessary to achieve the final product, the expression cassettes were either combined on one plasmid or positioned on different plasmids during the transfection. Cell culture supernatant containing recombinant fusion polypeptide was harvested three days post transfection and clarified by centrifugation at 300 x g followed by filtration through a 0.22 μm sterile filter. For larger scale expression of TRAIL receptor agonist fusion proteins to be used in vivo, synthetic DNA cassettes encoding the aforementioned proteins were inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors comprising appropriate selection markers (e.g. a functional expression cassette comprising a blasticidin, puromycin or hygromycin resistence gene) and genetic elements suitable to enhance the number of transcriptionally active insertion sites within the host cells genome. The sequence verified expression vectors were introduced by electroporation into suspension adapted Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO-S, Invitrogen). Appropriate selection pressure was applied three days post-transfection to the transfected cells. Surviving cells carrying the vector derived resistance gene(s) were recovered by subsequent cultivation under selection pressure. Upon stable growth of the selected cell pools in chemically defined medium (PowerCHO2-CD, Lonza) at 37° C. and 7% CO2 atmosphere in an orbital shaker incubator (100 rpm, 50 mm shaking throw), the individual supernatants were analysed by ELISA-assays detecting the aforementioned proteins and the cell pools with the highest specific productivity were expanded in shake flasks prior to protein production (orbital shaker, 100 rpm, shaking throw 50 mm). For lab-scale protein production, individual cell pools were cultured for 7-12 days in chemically defined medium (PowerCHO2-CD, Lonza) at 37° C. and 7% CO2 atmosphere in a Wave bioreactor 20/50 EHT (GE-Healthcare). The basal medium was PowerCHO2-CD supplemented with 4 mM Glutamax. Wave culture started with a viable cell concentration of 0.3 to 0.4×10e6 cells/ml and the following settings (for a five- or ten liter bag): shaking frequency 18 rpm, shaking ankle 7°, gas current 0.2-0.3 L/min, 7% CO2, 36.5° C. During the Wave run, the cell culture were fed twice with PowerFeed A (Lonza), usually on day 2 (20% feed) and day 5 (30% feed). After the second feed, shaking frequency was increased to 22rpm, as well as the shaking ankle to 8°. The bioreactor was usually harvested in between day 7 to day 12 when the cell viability dropped below 80%. First, the culture supernatant was clarified using a manual depth filtration system (Millipore Millistak Pod, MC0HC 0.054 m2). For Strep-tagged proteins, Avidin was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/L. Finally, the culture supernatant containing the TRAIL receptor agonist fusion protein was sterile filtered using a bottle top filter (0.22 μm, PES, Corning) and stored at 2-8° C. until further processing. For affinity purification Streptactin Sepharose was packed to a column (gel bed 1 ml), equilibrated with 15 ml buffer W (100 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) or PBS pH 7.4 and the cell culture supernatant was applied to the column with a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Subsequently, the column was washed with 15 ml buffer W and bound polypeptide was eluted stepwise by addition of 7×1 ml buffer E (100 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM Desthiobiotin, pH 8.0). Alternately, PBS pH 7.4 containing 2.5 mM Desthiobiotin can be used for this step. Alternately to the Streptactin Sepharose based method, the affinity purification was performed employing a column with immobilized Protein-A as affinity ligand and a Akta chromatography system (GE-Healthcare). A solid phase material with high affinity for the FC-domain of the fusion protein was chosen: MABSelect Sure™ (GE Healthcare). Briefly, the clarified cell culture supernatant was loaded on a HiTrap MabSelectSure column (CV=5 ml) equilibrated in wash-buffer-1 (20 mM Pi, 95 mM NaCl, pH7.2) not exceeding a load of 10mg fusion protein per ml column-bed. The column was washed with ten column-volumes (10 CV) of aforementioned equilibration buffer followed by four column-volumes (4 CV) of wash-buffer-2 (20 mM Pi, 95 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) to deplete host-cell protein and host-cell DNA. The column was then eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Pi, 95 mM NaCl, pH 3.5) and the eluate was collected in up to ten fractions with each fraction having a volume equal to column-bed volume (5 ml). Each fraction was neutralized with an equal volume of aforementioned wash-buffer-2. The linear velocity was set to 150 cm/h and kept constant during the aforementioned affinity chromatography method. The protein amount of the eluate fractions was quantitated and peak fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration and further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC was performed on Superdex 200 10/300 GL or HiLoad 26/60 columns using an Akta chromatography system (GE-Healthcare). The columns were equilibrated with phosphate buffered saline and the concentrated, affinity-purified polypeptide was loaded onto the SEC column with the sample volume not exceeding 2% (v/v) of the column-volume. In the case of Superdex200 10/300 GL columns (GE Healthcare), a flow rate of 0.5 ml per minute was applied. In the case of HiLoad 26/60 Superdex200 columns, a flow rate of 2.5 ml per minute was applied. The elution profile of the polypeptide was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. For determination of the apparent molecular weight of purified fusion polypeptide under native conditions a Superdex 200 column was loaded with standard proteins of known molecular weight. Based on the elution volume of the standard proteins a calibration curve was plotted and the apparent molecular weight of purified fusion polypeptide was determined. The FC-domain comprising TRAIL receptor agonist fusion proteins typically eluted from the Supoerdex200 columns with an apparent molecular weight for the homodimer of approx. 160-180 kDa. 3. Apoptosis Assay A cellular assay with a Jurkat A3 permanent T-cell line was used to determine the apoptosis inducing activity of the TRAIL-receptor agonist fusion proteins. Jurkat cells were grown in flasks with RPMI 1640-medium+GlutaMAX (GibCo) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml Penicillin and 100 μg/ml Streptomycin. Prior to the assay, 100,000 cells were seeded per well into a 96-well microtiterplate. The addition of different concentrations of fusion peptides to the wells was followed by a 3 hour incubation at 37° C. Cells were lysed by adding lysis buffer (250 mM HEPES, 50 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EGTA, 5% Triton-X-100, 100 mM DTT, 10 mM AEBSF, pH 7.5) and plates were put on ice for 30 minutes to 2 hours. Apoptosis is paralleled by an increased activity of caspases, e.g. Caspase-3. Hence, cleavage of the specific caspase substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC (Biomol) (“DEVD” disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 31) was used to determine the extent of apoptosis. In fact, Caspase activity correlates with the percentage of apoptotic cells determined morphologically after staining the cells with propidium iodide and Hoechst-33342. For the caspase activity assay, 20 μl cell lysate was transferred to a black 96-well microtiterplate. After the addition of 80 μl buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 1% Sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 50 μM Ac-DEVD-AFC (“DEVD” disclosed as SEQ ID NO: 31), and 25 mM DTT, pH 7.5, the plate was transferred to a Tecan Infinite 500 microtiterplate reader and the increase in fluorescence intensity was monitored (excitation wavelength 400 nm, emission wavelength 505 nm). 3.1 Cell death assay For the determination of cell death in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells 15,000 cells were plated in 96-well plates overnight in RPM1 1640-medium+GlutaMAX (GibCo) supplemented with 10% FBS (Biochrom). Cells were coincubated with cycloheximide (Sigma) at a final concentration of 2.5 g/ml. Cell death was quantified by staining with buffer KV (0.5% crystal violet, 20% methanol). After staining, the wells were washed with water and air-dried. The dye was eluted with methanol and optical density at 595 nm was measured with an ELISA reader. 4. Stability/Aggregation Test 4.1 Principle of the aggregation analysis (Definition for soluble protein) The content of monomers (defined trimeric assembly of TRAIL receptor binding modules) and aggregates is determined by analytical SEC as described in Example 2. For this particular purpose the analysis is performed in buffers containing physiological salt concentrations at physiological pH (e.g. 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4; PBS pH 7.4). A typical aggregation analysis is done on a Superdex200 column (GE Healthcare). This column separates proteins in the range between 10 to 800 kDa. For determination of the apparent molecular weight of purified fusion polypeptide under native conditions a Superdex 200 column is loaded with standard proteins of known molecular weight. Based on the elution volume of the standard proteins a calibration curve is plotted and the apparent molecular weight of purified fusion polypeptide is calculated based on the elution volume. SEC analysis of soluble, non-aggregated proteins, e.g. trimeric TRAIL, typically shows a distinct single protein peak at a defined elution volume. This elution volume corresponds to the apparent native molecular weight of the particular protein and approximately complies to the theoretical molecular weight calculated on the basis of the primary amino acid sequence. If protein aggregation occurs the SEC analysis shows additional protein peaks with lower retention volumes. For TRAIL, the aggregation of soluble proteins occurs in a characteristic manner. The proteins tend to form oligomers of the “timers”, forming nonamers (3×3) and 27 mers (3×9). These oligomers serve as aggregation seeds and a high content of oligomers potentially leads to aggregation of the protein. Oligomers of large molecular weight and aggregates elute in the void volume of the Superdex200 column and cannot be analysed by SEC with respect to their native molecular weight. Due to the induction of (complete) aggregation, purified preparations of TRAIL-SF fusion proteins should preferably contain only defined trimeric proteins and only a very low amount of oligomerised protein. The degree of aggregation/oligomerisation of a particular TRAIL-SF protein preparation is determined on basis of the SEC analysis by calculating the peak areas of the OD280 diagram for the defined trimeric and the oligomer/aggregate fraction, respectively. Based on the total peak area the percentage of defined trimeric protein is calculated as follows: [in-line-formulae](% Trimer content=[Peak area trimer]/[Total peak area]×100)[/in-line-formulae] The definition for soluble protein as used in this text, describes a protein preparation of purified TRAIL protein in a buffer of physiological salt concentrations at physiological pH that contains a defined soluble protein (trimeric assembly of TRAIL domains) content of >90% within a typical protein concentration range from 0.2 to 10.0 mg/ml. 5. Half-Life Determination Molecules A-D are each made up of two polypeptides covalently linked by interchain disulfide bonds. The number of glycosites and hinge cysteines (resulting in interchain disulfide bonds between proteins) were tested in order to determine the effect that altering these characteristics has on the half-life of these compounds. Female NMRI mice were treated with 1.2 mg/kg bw and/or with 4 mg/kg bw of the specified compounds as a single intravenous bolus injection. Whole blood was collected before application (predose), and up to 168 hours after test item administration. Serum was prepared and samples were stored at −80° C. until determination of serum concentrations. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the mean serum concentrations and the pharmacokinetic evaluation program PK Solutions Version 2.0 for non-compartmental pharmacokinetic data analysis (Summit Research Services, Montrose, Colo.). PK Solutions is an automated, Excel-based application, which computes pharmacokinetic parameters from concentration-time data obtained from analysis of e.g. biological samples following intravenous or extra-vascular routes of administration. PK Solutions calculates results without presuming any specific compartmental model. Quantitation of the test items in serum was performed with an ELISA-assay detecting the individual TRAIL-receptor agonists shown in Table 7 independent of a Strep-Tag being part of the molecules. The general layout is shown in FIG. 18. The results are summarized in Table 7. Molecule A (made up of two polypeptides of SEQ ID NO:26) has two hinge cysteines (forming two interchain disulfide bonds) and an N residue at position 297 of the Fc region (according to the EU index), resulting in wild-type CH2 glycosylation. Molecule A also has glycosites at positions 168 and 337. Molecule B (made up of two polypeptides of SEQ ID NO: 19) has three hinge cysteines (forming three interchain disulfide bonds) (at positions 513, 519, and 522) and an N297S mutation at position 297 of the Fc region (according to the EU index), resulting in aglycosylation of the CH2 domain. Molecule B also has glycosites at positions 168 and 337. Molecule C (made up of two polypeptides of SEQ ID NO: 27) has three hinge cysteines (forming three interchain disulfide bonds) and an N297S mutation at position 297 of the Fc region (according to the EU index), resulting in aglycosylation of the CH2 domain. Further, there is a glycosite at position 168 (linker 1), but not at position 337 (linker 2). Molecule D (made up of two polypeptides of SEQ ID NO:28) has three hinge cysteines (forming three interchain disulfide bonds) and an N297S mutation at position 297 of the Fc region (according to the EU index), resulting in aglycosylation of the CH2 domain. Further, the glycosites on both linker 1 and linker 2 (positions 168 and 337, respectively) have been depleted in Molecule D. The in vivo stability (as judged by compound half-life) of Molecule B (both linkers glycosylated, CH2 glycosites depleted, and the addition of a third hinge cysteine) was enhanced when compared to Molecule A. Further, the depletion of all glycosites in from the compound (Molecule D) resulted in reduced in vivo stability and low productivity during transient expression. Molecule C (first linker glycosylated, second linker aglycosylated, CH2 glycosites depleted) demonstrated an intermediate in vivo stability when compared to Molecules B and D (see results in Table 7). TABLE 7 Results of Compound Half-life Testing in NMRI-mice Terminal Terminal Number of Number of Half-life Half-life glycosylation hinge 4 mg/kg 1.2 mg/kg Molecule sites cysteines i.v.(hour) i.v.(hour) A 6 2 23.1 17.7 B 4 3 33.94 28.28 C 2 3 21.03 — D 0 3 8.81 — These experimental results demonstrate that combining linker glycosylation (in both linkers 1 and 2) with a third interchain disulfide bond (through the addition of a hinge cysteine) and the deglycosylation of the CH2 domain in the Fc region results in greater in vivo stability in the molecules of the instant invention. 6. In vitro demonstration of efficacy 6.1 TRAIL receptor agonist protein of SEQ ID NO: 19 inhibits human hematologic and solid tumor cell survival in vitro Tumor cells were seeded at 10,000 cells/well in 96-well plates in the recommended media containing 10% FBS and treated with a TRAIL receptor agonist protein made up of two polypeptides having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 19 for 24 hours at 37° C. in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cell viability was subsequently assessed using CellTiter-Glo® reagent as described by the manufacturer's instructions (Promega; Madison, Wis.). IC50 values were determined by non-linear regression analysis of the concentration response data normalized to non-treated control cells. Examples of resulting concentration response curves for Colo205, Jurkat and SKM-1 cells that demonstrate a loss in cell viability in response to TRAIL receptor agonist protein made up of two polypeptides having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 19 treatment are shown in FIG. 19.

Cell viability was subsequently assessed using CellTiter-Glo® reagent as described by the manufacturer's instructions. The Bliss independence model (Wong et al., 2012; Mol. Cancer Ther. 11:1026-1035; Bernebaum, 1981 Adv. Cancer Res. 35:269-335; Borisy et al., 2003 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:7977-7982) was employed to assess combination activity, with negative integers indicating antagonism, a value of zero indicating additive activity, and positive integers indicating synergy. Bliss scores were calculated for each combination in the dose matrix and totaled to give a “Bliss sum” value. An example of synergistic tumor cell death induced by co-treating human tumor cells with a TRAIL receptor agonist protein made up of two polypeptides having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:19 and venetoclax, navitoclax or DTX, with the associated Bliss sum is shown in FIGS. 20(A-C). Bliss sums determined for these combinations in a number of tumor cell lines are depicted in Table 9.

TRAIL receptor agonist protein of SEQ ID NO:19 treatment inhibits tumor growth in vivo The effect of a TRAIL receptor agonist protein made up of two polypeptides having the amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:19 on tumor growth was evaluated in subcutaneous Colo205 (colorectal), SKM-1 (acute myeloid leukemia), and H460LM (non-small cell lung) xenograft tumors implanted in SCID female mice (Charles Rivers Laboratories; Wilmington, Mass.). Briefly, human cancer cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the right hind flank of female SCID mice on study day 0.
