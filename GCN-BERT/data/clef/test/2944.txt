BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to fluorescent dye reagents. Fluorescent dyes are widely used for labeling, detecting, and quantifying components in a sample. Analytical methods that utilize such dye reagents include fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence immunoassay, flow cytometric analysis of cells, and various other applications. The choice of fluorescent dyes is particularly important in applications that utilize multiplex, multicolor analysis. Many fluorescent dyes currently used in aqueous systems have a tendency to form dimers or aggregate compromising their performance. Moreover, many dyes in current use exhibit poor chemical and/or photochemical stability. Thus, there is a continued need for the development of new fluorescent dye compounds. The present invention satisfies this need and provides related benefits as well.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed, in part, to a fluorescent dye compound of formula I: wherein CI is a charge balancing counterion and p is an integer from 1-7; m is 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9; each incidence of X is independently hydrogen, halogen, alkyl- or aryloxy, alkyl- or arylthio, amino- or substituted amino, aryl or alkyl, any of which may be optionally substituted with a substituent selected from carboxyl, sulfonate, sulfinate, sulfoxide, sulfone, sulfonamide, hydroxyl, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, alkoxy, and halogen; optionally, one or more X groups are combined to form a cyclic ring; Y is independently selected from O, NRa, S, Se, CRb═CRc and CR2R3; Z is independently selected from O, NRa, S, Se, CRb═CRc and CR4R5; Wherein Ra, Rb, Rc, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are independently selected from alkyl, aryl or substituted alkyl like aminoallyl, carboxyalkyl, sulfoalkyl; substituted aryl like carboxyaryl, sulfoaryl R1 is selected from aryl (for example phenyl, naphthyl), or alkyl, any of which may be optionally substituted with at least one substituent selected from carboxyl, sulfonate, sulfinate, sulfoxide, sulfone, sulfonamide, hydroxyl, amino, alkyl(aryl)amino, dialkylamino, alkoxy, aryloxy, halogen, succinimidyl ester, ester, and unsubstituted mono- or disubstituted amide; R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, R16, R17, and R18 are independently selected from carboxyl, sulfonate, sulfinate, sulfoxide, sulfone, sulfonamide, hydroxyl, amino, alkyl(aryl)amino, dialkylamino, alkoxy, aryloxy, halogen, alkyl succinimidyl ester, ester, amide, or any ortho-disposed pair of R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, R16, R17, and R18 is combined to form a further fused aromatic or heterocyclic ring which is optionally substituted; wherein at least one of R14, R15, R16, R17, or R18 is sulfonate or a further fused aromatic ring derived from R14, R15, R16, R17, or R18 comprises at least one sulfonate substituent; with the proviso that none of R14, R15, R16, R17, and R18 are carboxyl. Fluorescent dyes of the invention can be used as markers in many different ways for the analysis of a major part of clinically, biologically, biochemically or chemically relevant substances, such as for example cells, antibodies, proteins, hormones, nucleic acids, oligonucleotides, naturally occurring or modified nucleotides, carbohydrates and some others. Fluorescent dyes are known to be particularly suitable for biological applications in which highly sensitive detection is needed. Polymethine dyes derivatives often possess very narrow and intense absorption bands; their extinction coefficients and fluorescence quantum yields usually higher than those of other types of dyes having comparable absorption maximum. Moreover, such derivatives possess high sensitivity to their molecular environment, have greater selective absorption and better photostability, which are important parameters, especially for single molecular analysis. Some indodicyanine dyes exhibit strong fluorescence and high photostability. However, their utility is limited when the cyanine dyes are employed in aqueous solution due, in part, to the tendency to form aggregates [Angew. Chem. 49 (1936) 563; Nature 138 (1936) 1009]. These polymeric dye systems, in contrast with the individual molecule, exhibit a markedly changed absorption and fluorescence behaviour. As a result of the aggregation, the absorption maximum may be shifted in comparison with the monomer dye molecule and more significantly they fluoresce much more poorly. In some aspects, the present invention provides new cyanine dyes which do not exhibit the aforementioned drawbacks and which in particular exhibit a low tendency towards aggregation of the dyes themselves and are suitable for application as optical and especially fluorescent labels in the visible or near infrared region. In some embodiments, polymethine dyes of the present invention, due to specific substituent placement in dye molecule possess strong fluorescence, very low tendency to form dimers or higher aggregates and possess very high photo- and chemical stability. Due to specific structure of new dyes, they exhibit higher fluorescence and selectivity of light absorption and increased photo- and chemical stability relative to dyes of the same structural class. Higher fluorescence and increased photo- and chemical stability of new dyes are demonstrated below in the Examples. Without being bound by theory, the N-aryl substituents are believed to provide the dye molecule improved rigidity in terms of intramolecular vibronic interactions; prevent from intermolecular interactions, including reciprocal action with solvents, oxygen and other molecules, resulting in lower non-radiating energy loss from the excited state of such type of cyanine dyes in solution. Negatively charged dyes of the invention can be prepared with up to eight sulfonic groups in one dye molecule shown below: Again, without being bound by theory, such increasing of negative charge bearing by the dye molecule dramatically decreases its tendency towards dye-dye interaction and aggregation (especially when used in the context of multi-dye constructs or in “poly-labelled” systems both in solution as well as on the target especially “polymeric” molecules) and decreased tendency towards non-specific interactions of the dye at an arbitrary biomolecule (like DNA). Sulfonic (or sulfonato) acid groups can be incorporated into indolium or benzoindolium end groups via sulfoalkyl group attachment to nitrogen and/or C-3 carbon atoms of indocyanine dyes as exemplified by cyanine dyes A and B below (WO 2005/044923). Moreover, as shown in FIG. 1, it has been indicated that negatively charged dye A having two sulfonate groups is more readily self-quenched with increasing dye concentration relative to dye B with six sulfonic groups. In the present invention, hydrophilic negatively charged sulfonic-, sulfonato-groups are disposed on aromatic groups in compounds of Formula 1. Without being bound by theory, the out-of-plane twist of the N-phenyl substituent and the presence of a solvent sphere “around” the negatively charged sulfonate group act synergistically to decrease the tendency towards dye-dye interaction and aggregation resulting in the observed fluorescence in water solution, as shown in the Examples below. The 1-phenyl substituent in heterocyclic dye 3H-indolium end-group (N-Aryl) is not planar relative to the rest of dye molecule and thus provides a steric barrier to dye aggregation as well as aggregation with other non-dye molecules. This property can be useful, for example, in applications that employ dyes in conjunction with nucleic acids or proteins, where dye-nucleic or dye-protein interactions can be significant. By contrast N-alkyl substituted dyes known in the art do not provide such effect. Moreover from space-filling models of fragments of dyes of formula 1, one can observe that introducing a 1-phenyl substituent in heterocyclic dye 3H-indolium end groups (with an additional hydrophilic sulfonic group) increases the solvent surface around the molecule, which is further expected to deteriorate dye-dye interaction and aggregation in water solution and also additionally decrease the tendency towards non-specific interactions of the dye at an arbitrary biomolecule (like DNA) or surface. From a prototype dye based on N-methyl substituted indolium derivatives (like commercial dyes) and based on new N-aryl substituted indolium derivatives, one can observe how significantly decreased ability of the dye molecule to aggregate from even one end-group (N-phenyl substituted) compare to the other (N-methyl). In some embodiments, dye compounds of the invention exhibit enhanced photostability. It has been indicated that interaction of a dye molecule with oxygen (O2*) or per-hydroxy (OOH) radicals are the predominant pathways for dye photo-degradation. Identification of products of such type reactions have been demonstrated as shown in the scheme below: It has been postulated that the photo-bleaching ratio depends on Red-Ox potentials of dyes and correlate with availability of carbon atoms (especially those next to nitrogen atom) in a conjugation polymethine chain for interactions with active species. Thus, cyanine dyes of the invention, due at least in part to the N-aryl groups not only benefit from decreased aggregation but improved photochemical stability as well.

The product was precipitated with diethyl ether and washed with acetone and ethanol to provide 3.5 g (88%) of CP-9. Although sulfonated benzo[e]indolium systems have been incorporated into cyanine dyes, such compounds, exemplified by betaine CP-9A and 6,8-disulfonated derivative CP-9B, are either only monosulfonated or possess two sulfonate groups on the same single ring. CP-9 and related dyes based on the 5,7-disulfonated benzoindolium skeleton can exhibit improved photostability, provide improved water solubility and can exhibit a diminished tendency to aggregate compared to cyanine dyes based on their counterparts CP-9A and CP-9B. Moreover, the generality of the synthetic procedure is amendable to the preparation of N-aryl-substituted analogues of quaternary benzoindolium derivatives such as CP-9C below: Example X 3-Ethyl-2-methyl-7-sulfo-naphtho[2,1-d]thiazolium-5-sulfonate This Example shows the preparation of coupling partner CP-10, an intermediate useful in the preparation of dyes of the present invention. A mixture of 0.5 g (1.25 mmol) of 3-ethyl-2-methyl-naphtho[2,1-d]thiazolium tosylate and 5 ml fuming sulphuric acid was stirred at 70° C. for 5 hours. The product was precipitated with diethyl ether and washed with acetone and ethanol to provide 0.3 g (62%) of CP-10, which could be further purified by conventional column chromatography. Example XI 3-Ethyl-2-methyl-benzoxazolium-5- and 3-ethyl-2-methyl-benzoxazolium-6-sulfonate This Example shows the preparation of coupling partners CP-11 and CP12, intermediates useful in the preparation of dyes of the present invention. A mixture of 0.33 g (1 mmol) of 2-methyl-3-ethyl-benzoxazolium tosylate and 2 ml fuming sulphuric acid was stirred at room temperature for one hour then heated at 50° C. for four hours. The product was precipitated with diethyl ether washed with acetone and ethanol to provide 0.1 g (41%) of a mixture of CP-11 and CP-12. The isomers are separated by crystallisation from methanol with isomer CP-12 as the main fraction CP-11 isolated from the filtrate. It has been indicated that cyanine dyes based on the benzoxazolium structure exhibit strong fluorescence and can exhibit improved stability relative to indocarbo- and dicarbocyanine-based systems. Thus, dyes based on coupling partners CP-11 and CP-12, as well as N-arylated versions thereof, are expected to be strong fluorescent dye candidates. Example XII This Example shows the preparation of exemplary compound Dye 1 and comparison of its physical properties. A mixture of 80 mg (0.2 mmol) of 2,3,3-trimethyl-1-(3-sulfophenyl)-3H-indolium-5-sulfonate (CP-1), 20 mg 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)malonicdialdehyde, 0.5 ml pyridine in 1 ml of acetic anhydride was heated for three minutes at 145° C. under microwave irradiation. The product was precipitated with diethyl ether and converted to its sodium salt. The product was purified by HPLC providing 0.02 g (25%) of Dye 1, which shows an absorption maximum at 658 nm in aqueous solution. In a comparison of photo-stability of solutions of Dye 1 and Alexa 647 in water, dye 1 shows improved photostability relative to these commercial dyes. After 25 days of irradiation the solution of Dye 1 still possessed 85% of its initial fluorescence intensity. Example XIII This Example shows the preparation of exemplary compound Dye 2 and its physical properties. A mixture of 0.395 g (1 mmol) of 2,3,3-trimethyl-1-(3-sulfophenyl)-3H-indolium-5-sulfonate (CP-1, Example I) and 0.525 g (1 mmol) 2-(4-acetanilidobutadienyl)-3,3-dimethyl-1-(5-carboxypentyl)-3H-indolium-5-sulfonate: in 3 ml of acetic anhydride and 0.3 g triethylamine was heated for 20 minutes at 110° C. The acetic anhydride was removed under reduced pressure and the product precipitated with ethylacetate to provide 0.6 g (55%) of Dye 2, which could be further purified by HPLC. Dye 2 exhibits an absorption maximum at 647 nm in water. Dye 2 stability was also compared against the stability of Cy5 (GE Healthcare) in water after six days storage of a solution on a bench top. Dye 2 maintained better fluorescence intensity over the six day test period. Dye 2 stability was also measured by absorbance decay, with a comparison to Cy5 and Alexa647 in water after irradiation by 660 nm laser. Dye 2 was more stable in water compared than the structurally similar commercial dyes Cy5 and Alexa647. Example XIV This Example shows the preparation of exemplary compound Dye 3 and its physical properties. A mixture of 0.395 g (1 mmol) of 2,3,3-trimethyl-1-(3-sulfophenyl)-3H-indolium-5-sulfonate (CP-1, Example I), 0.457 g (1 mmol) 2-(2-anilinovinyl)-3,3-dimethyl-1-(5-carboxypentyl)-3H-indolium-5-sulfonate: in 5 ml of acetic anhydride and 0.3 g triethylamine was heated for 20 minutes at 110° C. The acetic anhydride was removed under reduced pressure and the product precipitated with ethylacetate to provide 0.65 g (68%) Dye 3, which could be further purified by HPLC. Dye 3 exhibits an absorption maximum at 550 nm in water. The fluorescence intensity of Dye 3 (331 a.u. at 575 nm) compared with Cy3 (422 a.u. at 565 nm) in water at the same optical density of solution under excitation at 545 nm. FIG. 2 shows an overlay of the absorption spectrum of Dye 3 with Cy3 in water. As shown in FIG. 2, the fluorescence max for the Dye 3 Red shifted with a slightly larger Stokes shift (about 25 nm) and as a result provides better separation of the fluorescence signal from the excitation wavelength. Moreover, the integrated fluorescence intensity is higher for Dye 3 even at Cy3 absorption maximum. Dye 3 also exhibits better stability over time compared to Cy3, where after 14 days, the optical density of Cy3 is 85% compared to 94% with Dye 3. Example XV This Example shows the preparation of exemplary compound Dye 4 and its physical properties. A mixture of 36 mg of 1,1,3-trimethyl-3-(3-sulfophenyl)-1H-benzo[e]indolium-disulfonate (CP-13B): and 10 mg malonic aldehyde dianil hydrochloride, 0.5 mL acetic anhydride and 0.5 ml pyridine was heated at 120° C. for 5 minutes. The acetic anhydride removed under reduced pressure and the product precipitated with ethylacetate to provide 15 mg of Dye 4, which exhibited an absorption maximum at 683 nm in water. Dye 4 exhibited similar absorption as commercially available dyes for the same spectral region: Dy681 and Dy682 (Dyomics GmbH, Jena, Germany). However, the fluorescence maximum for Dye 4 has bathochromic shift and as a result provides better separation of the fluorescent signal from excitation wavelength and less cross-talk with 660 dye. Dye 4 also had higher fluorescence intensity than Dy681 and Dy682. Preparation of coupling partner 13B, 1,1,3-Trimethyl-3-(3-sulfophenyl)-1H-benzo[e]indolium-disulfonate triethylammonium salt: 1,1,2-Trimethyl-3-phenyl-1H-benzo[e]indolium perchlorate N-Phenyl-N-(2-naphthyl)hydrazine (2.3 g) (or hydrochloride (2.7 g)) was dissolved in 50 ml of ethanol and 10 g of 3-methyl-butanone-2 was added.

A comparison of Dye 5A and 5B with commercially available Dy681 and Dy682 shows that the fluorescence intensity for Dye 5A and 5B are higher than the commercial dyes. Moreover, the fluorescence maximum for Dye 5A and 5B are red shifted and as a result providing better separation of the fluorescent signal from the excitation wavelength and less cross-talk with 660 dye. Finally, Dyes 5A and 5B are brighter than Dy681 and Dy681 and exhibit better stability as shown in FIG. 3.

A few examples of symmetrical N-phenyl-substituted indocyanine dyes are known such as dyes 1, 2 see for example: EP 1134613 (2001); US 2005/0013966, JP 2002226731. These dyes have fluorescence properties and therefore they found some practical application: WO 96/10620; US 2004/6835431. However, such dyes can have insufficient fluorescence in water or biological systems. To compare fluorescent properties of dyes based on unknown before sulfonated N-arylindole derivatives and known prototype (2) some new dye with one (NR 647 S1) and t(NR 647 S2)N-phenyl-indole moiety were prepared. Spectral properties for solutions of new symmetrical dyes in water presented in Table 1.

Further investigations reveal that solutions of new dyes (such as NR647 S2 and NR647 S1) not only have stronger fluorescence but they are more photo-stable than prototype (2) as well. One of the modern applications of cyanine dyes based on their fluorescent properties is chemically labelling of different bio-molecules. For such applications a dye molecule can be modified with a functional group like amino or carboxy-groups, which making them suitable for coupling. For this purpose a series of unsymmetrical dyes with one functional carboxy- and at least one sulfonic group have been prepared. Table 2 shows the fluorescence properties of unsymmetrical N-arylindodicarbocyanines in water.
