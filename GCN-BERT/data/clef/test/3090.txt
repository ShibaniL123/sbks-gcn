INHIBITORS OF INDOLEAMINE 2,3-DIOXYGENASE (IDO) CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/791,224, filed March 15, 2013, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates generally to compounds that modulate or inhibit the enzymatic activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), pharmaceutical compositions containing said compounds and methods of treating proliferative disorders, such as cancer, viral infections and/or autoimmune diseases utilizing the compounds of the invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Tryptophan is an amino acid which is essential for cell proliferation and survival. Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase is a heme-containing intracellular enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-determining step in the degradation of the essential amino acid L-tryptophan to N-formyl-kynurenine. N-formyl-kynurenine is then metabolized by mutliple steps to eventually produce nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Tryptophan catabolites produced from N-formyl-kynurenine, such as kynurenine, are known to be preferentially cytotoxic to T-cells. Thus an overexpression of IDO can lead to increased tolerance in the tumor microenvironment. IDO overexpression has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor for decreased survival in patients with melanoma, pancreatic, colorectal and endometrial cancers among others. Moreover, IDO has been found to be implicated in neurologic and psychiatric disorders including mood idsorders as well as other chronic diseases characterized by IDO activation and tryptophan depletiion, such as viral infections, for example AIDS, Alzheimer’s disease, cancers including T-cell leukemia and colon cancer, autimmune diseases, diseases of the eye such as cataracts, bacterial infections such as Lyme disease, and streptococcal infections. Accordingly, an agent which is safe and effective in inhibiting production of IDO would be a most welcomed addition to the physician’s armamentarium.

For example, the compounds described herein may be used to treat or prevent viral infections, proliferative diseases (e.g., cancer), and autoimmune diseases. III. THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are useful in treating or preventing any disease or conditions that are sensitive to enzymatic activity of IDO. These include viral and other infections (e.g., skin infections, GI infection, urinary tract infections, genito-urinary infections, systemic infections), proliferative diseases (e.g., cancer), and autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus). The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to animals, preferably mammals (e.g., domesticated animals, cats, dogs, mice, rats), and more preferably humans. Any method of administration may be used to deliver the compound or pharmaceutical composition to the patient. In certain embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutical composition is administered orally. In other embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutical composition is administered parenterally. Compounds of the invention can modulate activity of the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). The term "modulate" is meant to refer to an ability to increase or decrease activity of an enzyme or receptor. Accordingly, compounds of the invention can be used in methods of modulating IDO by contacting the enzyme with any one or more of the compounds or compositions described herein. In some embodiments, compounds of the present invention can act as inhibitors of IDO. In further embodiments, the compounds of the invention can be used to modulate activity of IDO in cell or in an individual in need of modulation of the enzyme by administering a modulating (e.g., inhibiting) amount of a compound of the invention. Compounds of the invention can inhibit activity of the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). For example, the compounds of the invention can be used to inhibit activity of IDO in cell or in an individual in need of modulation of the enzyme by administering an inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention. The present invention further provides methods of inhibiting the degradation of tryptophan in a system containing cells expressing IDO such as a tissue, living organism, or cell culture. In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of altering (e.g., increasing) extracellular tryptophan levels in a mammal by administering an effective amount of a compound of composition provided herein. Methods of measuring tryptophan levels and tryptophan degradation are routine in the art. The present invention further provides methods of inhibiting immunosuppression such as IDO-mediated immunosuppression in a patient by administering to the patient an effective amount of a compound or composition recited herein. IDO-mediated immunosuppression has been associated with, for example, cancers, tumor growth, metastasis, viral infection, and viral replication. The present invention further provides methods of treating diseases associated with activity or expression, including abnormal activity and/or overexpression, of IDO in an individual (e.g., patient) by administering to the individual in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount or dose of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutical composition thereof. Example diseases can include any disease, disorder or condition that is directly or indirectly linked to expression or activity of the IDO enzyme, such as over expression or abnormal activity. An IDO-associated disease can also include any disease, disorder or condition that can be prevented, ameliorated, or cured by modulating enzyme activity. Examples of IDO-associated diseases include cancer, viral infection such as HIV infection, HCV infection, depression, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease, trauma, age-related cataracts, organ transplantation (e.g., organ transplant rejection), and autoimmune diseases including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, allergic inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus. As used herein, the term "cell" is meant to refer to a cell that is in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo. In some embodiments, an ex vivo cell can be part of a tissue sample excised from an organism such as a mammal. In some embodiments, an in vitro cell can be a cell in a cell culture. In some embodiments, an in vivo cell is a cell living in an organism such as a mammal. As used herein, the term "contacting" refers to the bringing together of indicated moieties in an in vitro system or an in vivo system. For example, "contacting" the IDO enzyme with a compound of the invention includes the administration of a compound of the present invention to an individual or patient, such as a human, having IDO, as well as, for example, introducing a compound of the invention into a sample containing a cellular or purified preparation containing the IDO enzyme. The term "IDO inhibitor" refers to an agent capable of inhibiting the activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and thereby reversing IDO-mediated immunosuppression. The IDO inhibitor may inhibit IDOl and/or ID02 (INDOL1). An IDO inhibitor may be a reversible or irreversible IDO inhibitor. "A reversible IDO inhibitor" is a compound that reversibly inhibits IDO enzyme activity either at the catalytic site or at a non-catalytic site and "an irreversible IDO inhibitor" is a compound that irreversibly destroys IDO enzyme activity by forming a covalent bond with the enzyme. Types of cancers that may be treated with the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, brain cancers, skin cancers, bladder cancers, ovarian cancers, breast cancers, gastric cancers, pancreatic cancers, prostate cancers, colon cancers, blood cancers, lung cancers and bone cancers.

One or more additional pharmaceutical agents or treatment methods such as, for example, anti-viral agents, chemotherapeutics or other anti-cancer agents, immune enhancers, immunosuppressants, radiation, anti-tumor and anti-viral vaccines, cytokine therapy (e.g., IL2 and GM-CSF), and/or tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be optionally used in combination with the compounds of the present invention for treatment of IDO-associated diseases, disorders or conditions. The agents can be combined with the present compounds in a single dosage form, or the agents can be administered simultaneously or sequentially as separate dosage forms. Suitable chemotherapeutic or other anti-cancer agents include, for example, alkylating agents (including, without limitation, nitrogen mustards, ethylenimine derivatives, alkyl sulfonates, nitrosoureas and triazenes) such as uracil mustard, chlormethine, cyclophosphamide (CYTOXAN®), ifosfamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, pipobroman, triethylene-melamine, triethylenethiophosphoramine, busulfan, carmustine, lomustine, streptozocin, dacarbazine, and temozolomide. In the treatment of melanoma, suitable agents for use in combination with the compounds of the present invention include: dacarbazine (DTIC), optionally, along with other chemotherapy drugs such as carmustine (BCNU) and cisplatin; the "Dartmouth regimen", which consists of DTIC, BCNU, cisplatin and tamoxifen; a combination of cisplatin, vinblastine, and DTIC, temozolomide or YERVOY™. Compounds according to the invention may also be combined with immunotherapy drugs, including cytokines such as interferon alpha, interleukin 2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the treatment of melanoma. Compounds of the invention may also be used in combination with vaccine therapy in the treatment of melanoma. Antimelanoma vaccines are, in some ways, similar to the anti-virus vaccines which are used to prevent diseases caused by viruses such as polio, measles, and mumps. Weakened melanoma cells or parts of melanoma cells called antigens may be injected into a patient to stimulate the body's immune system to destroy melanoma cells. Melanomas that are confined to the arms or legs may also be treated with a combination of agents including one or more compounds of the invention, using a hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion technique. This treatment protocol temporarily separates the circulation of the involved limb from the rest of the body and injects high doses of chemotherapy into the artery feeding the limb, thus providing high doses to the area of the tumor without exposing internal organs to these doses that might otherwise cause severe side effects. Usually the fluid is warmed to 102° to 104° F. Melphalan is the drug most often used in this chemotherapy procedure. This can be given with another agent called tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Suitable chemotherapeutic or other anti-cancer agents include, for example, antimetabolites (including, without limitation, folic acid antagonists, pyrimidine analogs, purine analogs and adenosine deaminase inhibitors) such as methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, floxuridine, cytarabine, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, fludarabine phosphate, pentostatine, and gemcitabine.

Other anti-cancer agents also include those that block immune cell migration such as antagonists to chemokine receptors, including CCR2 and CCR4. Other anti-cancer agents also include those that augment the immune system such as adjuvants or adoptive Τ cell transfer. Anti-cancer vaccines include dendritic cells, synthetic peptides, DNA vaccines and recombinant viruses. The pharmaceutical composition of the invention may optionally include at least one signal transduction inhibitor (STI). A "signal transduction inhibitor" is an agent that selectively inhibits one or more vital steps in signaling pathways, in the normal function of cancer cells, thereby leading to apoptosis. Suitable STIs include, but are not limited to: (i) bcr/abl kinase inhibitors such as, for example, STI 571 (GLEEVEC®); (ii) epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor inhibitors such as, for example, kinase inhibitors (IRESSA®, SSI-774) and antibodies (Imclone: C225 [Goldstein et al., Clin.

Med. Chern. Anti-Canc. Agents, 3:47-56 (2003)); and (vi) phosphatidyl inositol kinase inhibitors such as, for example, LY294002 (see, for example, Vlahos et al., J. Biol. Chem., 269:5241-5248 (1994)). Alternatively, at least one STI and at least one IDO inhibitor may be in separate pharmaceutical compositions.

The combination therapy is intended to embrace administration of these therapeutic agents in a sequential manner, that is, wherein each therapeutic agent is administered at a different time, as well as administration of these therapeutic agents, or at least two of the therapeutic agents, in a substantially simultaneous manner. Substantially simultaneous administration can be accomplished, for example, by administering to the subject a single dosage form having a fixed ratio of each therapeutic agent or in multiple, single dosage forms for each of the therapeutic agents. Sequential or substantially simultaneous administration of each therapeutic agent can be effected by any appropriate route including, but not limited to, oral routes, intravenous routes, intramuscular routes, and direct absorption through mucous membrane tissues. The therapeutic agents can be administered by the same route or by different routes. For example, a first therapeutic agent of the combination selected may be administered by intravenous injection while the other therapeutic agents of the combination may be administered orally. Alternatively, for example, all therapeutic agents may be administered orally or all therapeutic agents may be administered by intravenous injection. Combination therapy also can embrace the administration of the therapeutic agents as described above in further combination with other biologically active ingredients and non-drug therapies (e.g., surgery or radiation treatment). Where the combination therapy further comprises a non-drug treatment, the non-drug treatment may be conducted at any suitable time so long as a beneficial effect from the co-action of the combination of the therapeutic agents and non-drug treatment is achieved. For example, in appropriate cases, the beneficial effect is still achieved when the non-drug treatment is temporally removed from the administration of the therapeutic agents, perhaps by days or even weeks. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND DOSING The invention also provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions which comprise a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the compounds of Formula I, formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (additives) and/or diluents, and optionally, one or more additional therapeutic agents described above. The compounds of this invention can be administered for any of the uses described herein by any suitable means, for example, orally, such as tablets, capsules (each of which includes sustained release or timed release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions (including nanosuspensions, microsuspensions, spray-dried dispersions), syrups, and emulsions; sublingually; bucally; parenterally, such as by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intrastemal injection, or infusion techniques (e.g., as sterile injectable aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions); nasally, including administration to the nasal membranes, such as by inhalation spray; topically, such as in the form of a cream or ointment; or rectally such as in the form of suppositories. They can be administered alone, but generally will be administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" as used herein means a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or vehicle, such as a liquid or solid filler, diluent, excipient, manufacturing aid (e.g., lubricant, talc magnesium, calcium or zinc stearate, or steric acid), or solvent encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting the subject compound from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not injurious to the patient. The term "pharmaceutical composition" means a composition comprising a compound of the invention in combination with at least one additional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to media generally accepted in the art for the delivery of biologically active agents to animals, in particular, mammals, including, i.e., adjuvant, excipient or vehicle, such as diluents, preserving agents, fillers, flow regulating agents, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, antibacterial agents, antifungal agents, lubricating agents and dispensing agents, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are formulated according to a number of factors well within the purview of those of ordinary skill in the art. These include, without limitation: the type and nature of the active agent being formulated; the subject to which the agent-containing composition is to be administered; the intended route of administration of the composition; and the therapeutic indication being targeted. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include both aqueous and non-aqueous liquid media, as well as a variety of solid and semi-solid dosage forms. Such carriers can include a number of different ingredients and additives in addition to the active agent, such additional ingredients being included in the formulation for a variety of reasons, e.g., stabilization of the active agent, binders, etc., well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Descriptions of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and factors involved in their selection, are found in a variety of readily available sources such as, for example, Allen, L. V. Jr. et αℓ. Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (2 Volumes), 22nd Edition (2012), Pharmaceutical Press. The dosage regimen for the compounds of the present invention will, of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the species, age, sex, health, medical condition, and weight of the recipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; the route of administration, the renal and hepatic function of the patient, and the effect desired. By way of general guidance, the daily oral dosage of each active ingredient, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.001 to about 5000 mg per day, preferably between about 0.01 to about 1000 mg per day, and most preferably between about 0.1 to about 250 mg per day. Intravenously, the most preferred doses will range from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. Compounds of this invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily. The compounds are typically administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients, or carriers (collectively referred to herein as pharmaceutical carriers) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, e.g., oral tablets, capsules, elixirs, and syrups, and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices. Dosage forms (pharmaceutical compositions) suitable for administration may contain from about 1 milligram to about 2000 milligrams of active ingredient per dosage unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.1-95% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. A typical capsule for oral administration contains at least one of the compounds of the present invention (250 mg), lactose (75 mg), and magnesium stearate (15 mg). The mixture is passed through a 60 mesh sieve and packed into a No. 1 gelatin capsule. A typical injectable preparation is produced by aseptically placing at least one of the compounds of the present invention (250 mg) into a vial, aseptically freeze-drying and sealing. For use, the contents of the vial are mixed with 2 mL of physiological saline, to produce an injectable preparation. The present invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as an active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the compounds of the present invention, alone or in combination with a pharmaceutical carrier. Optionally, compounds of the present invention can be used alone, in combination with other compounds of the invention, or in combination with one or more other therapeutic agent(s), e.g., an anticancer agent or other pharmaceutically active material. Regardless of the route of administration selected, the compounds of the present invention, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art. Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the particular compound of the present invention employed, or the ester, salt or amide thereof, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion or metabolism of the particular compound being employed, the rate and extent of absorption, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts. A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. In general, a suitable daily dose of a compound of the invention will be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Generally, oral, intravenous, intracerebroventricular and subcutaneous doses of the compounds of this invention for a patient will range from about 0.01 to about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. If desired, the effective daily dose of the active compound may be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day, optionally, in unit dosage forms. In certain aspects of the invention, dosing is one administration per day. While it is possible for a compound of the present invention to be administered alone, it is preferable to administer the compound as a pharmaceutical formulation (composition). DEFINITIONS Unless specifically stated otherwise herein, references made in the singular may also include the plural. For example, “a” and “an” may refer to either one, or one or more. Unless otherwise indicated, any heteroatom with unsatisfied valences is assumed to have hydrogen atoms sufficient to satisfy the valences. Throughout the specification and the appended claims, a given chemical formula or name shall encompass all stereo and optical isomers and racemates thereof where such isomers exist. Unless otherwise indicated, all chiral (enantiomeric and diastereomeric) and racemic forms are within the scope of the invention. Many geometric isomers of C=C double bonds, C=N double bonds, ring systems, and the like can also be present in the compounds, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis- and trans- (or Ε- and Ζ-) geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. The present compounds can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Optically active forms may be prepared by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials. All processes used to prepare compounds of the present invention and intermediates made therein are considered to be part of the present invention. When enantiomeric or diastereomeric products are prepared, they may be separated by conventional methods, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Depending on the process conditions the end products of the present invention are obtained either in free (neutral) or salt form. Both the free form and the salts of these end products are within the scope of the invention. If so desired, one form of a compound may be converted into another form. A free base or acid may be converted into a salt; a salt may be converted into the free compound or another salt; a mixture of isomeric compounds of the present invention may be separated into the individual isomers. Compounds of the present invention, free form and salts thereof, may exist in multiple tautomeric forms, in which hydrogen atoms are transposed to other parts of the molecules and the chemical bonds between the atoms of the molecules are consequently rearranged. It should be understood that all tautomeric forms, insofar as they may exist, are included within the invention.

For purposes of clarity and in accordance with standard convention in the art, the symbol > is used in formulas and tables to show the bond that is the point of attachment of the moiety or substituent to the core/nucleus of the structure. Additonally, for purposes of clarity, where a substituent has a dash (-) that is not between two letters or symbols; this is used to indicate a point of attachment for a substituent. For example, -CONH2 is attached through the carbon atom. Additionally, for purposes of clarity, when there is no substituent shown at the end of a solid line, this indicates that there is a methyl (CH3) group connected to the bond.

Such amine protecting groups fitting these criteria include those listed in Wuts, Ρ. G. Μ. and Greene, T.W. Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th Edition, Wiley (2007) and The Peptides: Analysis, Synthesis, Biology, Vol. 3, Academic Press, New York (1981), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Examples of amine protecting groups include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) acyl types such as formyl, trifluoroacetyl, phthalyl, and p-toluenesulfonyl; (2) aromatic carbamate types such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) and substituted benzyloxycarbonyls, l-(p-biphenyl)-l-methylethoxycarbonyl, and 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc); (3) aliphatic carbamate types such as fc/7-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), ethoxycarbonyl, diisopropylmethoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl; (4) cyclic alkyl carbamate types such as cyclopentyloxycarbonyl and adamantyloxycarbonyl; (5) alkyl types such as triphenylmethyl and benzyl; (6) trialkylsilane such as trimethylsilane; (7) thiol containing types such as phenylthiocarbonyl and dithiasuccinoyl; and (8) alkyl types such as triphenylmethyl, methyl, and benzyl; and substituted alkyl types such as 2,2,2-trichloroethyl, 2-phenylethyl, and /-butyl; and trialkylsilane types such as trimethylsilane. As referred to herein, the term “substituted” means that at least one hydrogen atom is replaced with a non-hydrogen group, provided that normal valencies are maintained and that the substitution results in a stable compound. Ring double bonds, as used herein, are double bonds that are formed between two adjacent ring atoms (e.g., C=C, C=N, or Ν=Ν). In cases wherein there are nitrogen atoms (e.g., amines) on compounds of the present invention, these may be converted to N-oxides by treatment with an oxidizing agent (e.g., mCPBA and/or hydrogen peroxides) to afford other compounds of this invention. Thus, shown and claimed nitrogen atoms are considered to cover both the shown nitrogen and its N-oxide (N->0) derivative. When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-3 R, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to three R groups, and at each occurrence R is selected independently from the definition of R. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom in which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms that are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and/or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic groups such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic, and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 22nd Edition, Allen, L. V. Jr., Ed.; Pharmaceutical Press, London, UK (2012), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In addition, compounds of formula I may have prodrug forms. Any compound that will be converted in vivo to provide the bioactive agent (ΐ.℮., a compound of formula I) is a prodrug within the scope and spirit of the invention. Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art. For examples of such prodrug derivatives, see: a) Bundgaard, Η., ed., Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier (1985), and Widder, Κ. et al., eds., Methods in Enzymology, 112:309-396, Academic Press (1985); b) Bundgaard, Η., Chapter 5, "Design and Application of Prodrugs," A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, ρρ. 113-191, Krosgaard-Larsen, Ρ. et al., eds., Harwood Academic Publishers (1991); c) Bundgaard, Η., Adv.

Prodrugs and Targeted Delivery (Methods and Principles in Medicinal Chemistry), Vol 47, Wiley-VCH, 2011. Compounds containing a carboxy group can form physiologically hydrolyzable esters that serve as prodrugs by being hydrolyzed in the body to yield formula I compounds per se. Such prodrugs are preferably administered orally since hydrolysis in many instances occurs principally under the influence of the digestive enzymes. Parenteral administration may be used where the ester per se is active, or in those instances where hydrolysis occurs in the blood. Examples of physiologically hydrolyzable esters of compounds of formula I include C^alkyl, C^alkylbenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, indanyl, phthalyl, methoxymethyl, C ΐ _<s alkanoyloxy-C’i^alkyl (e.g., acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl or propionyloxymethyl), C|^alkoxycarbonyloxy-C|_^alky 1 (e.g., methoxycarbonyl-oxymethyl or ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, glycyloxymethyl, phenylglycyloxymethyl, (5-methyl-2-oxo-l,3-dioxolen-4-yl)-methyl), and other well known physiologically hydrolyzable esters used, for example, in the penicillin and cephalosporin arts. Such esters may be prepared by conventional techniques known in the art. Preparation of prodrugs is well known in the art and described in, for example, King, F.D., ed., Medicinal Chemistry: Principles and Practice, The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK (2nd edition, reproduced, 2006); Testa, Β. et al., Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism. Chemistry, Biochemistry and Enzymology, VCHA and Wiley-VCH, Zurich, Switzerland (2003); Wermuth, C.G., ed., The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, 3rd edition, Academic Press, San Diego, CA (2008). The present invention is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include deuterium and tritium. Isotopes of carbon include 13C and 14C. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed. The term “solvate” means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. The solvent molecules in the solvate may be present in a regular arrangement and/or a non-ordered arrangement. The solvate may comprise either a stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric amount of the solvent molecules. “Solvate” encompasses both solution-phase and isolable solvates. Exemplary solvates include, but are not limited to, hydrates, ethanolates, methanolates, and isopropanolates. Methods of solvation are generally known in the art. As used herein, the term “patient” refers to organisms to be treated by the methods of the present invention. Such organisms preferably include, but are not limited to, mammals (e.g., murines, simians, equines, bovines, porcines, canines, felines, and the like), and most preferably refers to humans. As used herein, the term "effective amount" means that amount of a drug or pharmaceutical agent, i.e., a compound of the invention, that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought, for instance, by a researcher or clinician. Furthermore, the term "therapeutically effective amount" means any amount which, as compared to a corresponding subject who has not received such amount, results in improved treatment, healing, prevention, or amelioration of a disease, disorder, or side effect, or a decrease in the rate of advancement of a disease or disorder. An effective amount can be administered in one or more administrations, applications or dosages and is not intended to be limited to a particular formulation or administration route. The term also includes within its scope amounts effective to enhance normal physiological function As used herein, the term “treating” includes any effect, e.g., lessening, reducing, modulating, ameliorating or eliminating, that results in the improvement of the condition, disease, disorder, and the like, or ameliorating a symptom thereof. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutical composition” refers to the combination of an active agent with a carrier, inert or active, making the composition especially suitable for diagnostic or therapeutic use in vivo or ex vivo. Examples of bases include, but are not limited to, alkali metals (e.g., sodium) hydroxides, alkaline earth metals (e.g., magnesium), hydroxides, ammonia, and compounds of formula NW/, wherein W is Ci_4 alkyl, and the like. For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of the present invention are contemplated as being pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of acids and bases that are non-pharmaceutically acceptable may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. METHODS OF PREPARATION The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by methods such as those illustrated in the following Schemes utilizing chemical transformations known to those skilled in the art. Solvents, temperatures, pressures, and other reaction conditions may readily be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art. Starting materials are commercially available or readily prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art. These Schemes are illustrative and are not meant to limit the possible techniques one skilled in the art may use to manufacture compounds disclosed herein. Different methods may be evident to those skilled in the art. Additionally, the various steps in the synthesis may be performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the desired compound(s). Further, the representation of the reactions in these Schemes as discrete steps does not preclude their being performed in tandem, either by telescoping multiple steps in the same reaction vessel or by performing multiple steps without purifying or characterizing the intermediate(s). In addition, many of the compounds prepared by the methods below can be further modified using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art. All documents cited herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. References to many of these chemical transformations employed herein can be found in Smith, Μ.Β. et al., March's Advanced Organic Chemistry Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, Fifth Edition, Wiley-Interscience, New York (2001), or other standard texts on the topic of synthetic organic chemistry. Certain transformations may require that reactive functional groups be masked by protecting group(s). A convenient reference which provides conditions for introduction, removal, and relative susceptibility to reaction conditions of these groups is Greene, T.W. et al., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley-Interscience, New York (1999). GENERAL EXPERIMENTAL All reactions were carried out with continuous magnetic stirring under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen or argon. All evaporations and concentrations were carried out on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. Commercial reagents were used as received without additional purification. Solvents were commercial anhydrous grades and were used without further drying or purification. Flash chromatography was performed using prepacked REDISEP® Rf silica gel columns on a CombiFlash Companion machine. Air- or moisture-sensitive reactions were generally performed under an atmosphere of nitrogen or argon in anhydrous solvents (EMD DRISOLV®). Zinc (-325 mesh) for nitro group reduction was obtained from Alfa Aesar. Reaction concentrations indicated in the tables and procedures are given in units of molar and are approximate. Temperatures are given in degrees Celsius. Reactions were monitored for completeness by thin layer chromatography (TLC) or tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LCMS). For TLC, 0.25 mm plates coated with Silica60/F254 were used with visualization by UV light at ~254 ηΜ, exposure to iodine vapor, or heating with ΡΜΑ (phosphomolybdic acid solution), ninhydrin in ethanol, anisaldehyde solution, or ceric ammonium molybdate solution. Unless otherwise specified, "dried" refers to the addition of anhydrous MgSCE followed by filtration and rinsing the residual solids with an appropriate organic solvent. "Stripped" means concentration under reduced pressure, generally on a rotary evaporator. "Silica gel chromatography", "flash chromatography", or "chromatographed on silica gel" refers to glass column chromatography performed in a manner similar to that described by Still (J. Org. Chem., 43:2923 (1978)). Typically silica gel 60 (EMD, 230-400 mesh ASTM) is used with solvents from JT Baker or Mallinckrodt. HPLC refers to purification by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using the stated columns and mobile phases. Analytical HPLC runs were performed using the columns, flow rates, and mobile phases indicated. It is understood that analytical HPLC retention times (Tr) may be dependent on temperature, pH, and other factors. ISCO refers to chromatography on pre-packed silica gel cartridges using automated systems marketed by Teledyne Isco. For all chromatographic purifications the isolation of product by concentration of the appropriate fractions by evaporation at or below ambient pressure is implied. Melting points were determined on a Thomas-Hoover Uni-Melt apparatus and are uncorrected. Generally, mass spectral results are reported as the (M+H)+ value. For halogenated compounds where two or more peaks are significant, m/z for one peak in the cluster, generally the most intense, is reported, 'll NMR spectra were recorded on dilute solutions at 400 or 500 MHz on VARIAN® or JEOL® instruments in the solvents indicated. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) downfield from internal tetramethylsilane (TMS) or from the position of TMS inferred by the deuterated NMR solvent. Apparent multiplicities are reported as: singlet-s, doublet-d, triplet-t, quartet-q, or multiplet-m. Peaks which exhibit broadening are further denoted as br. Integrations are approximate. It should be noted that integration intensities, peak shapes, chemical shifts and coupling constants can be dependent on solvent, concentration, temperature, pH, and other factors. Further, peaks which overlap with or exchange with water or solvent peaks in the NMR spectrum may not provide reliable integration intensities. Preparative Reverse Phase HPLC was performed with a linear gradient elution using H20/MeOH or H20/MeCN mixtures buffered with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid or 10 mM NH4OAC and detection at 220 nm on one of the following columns: Shimadzu Sunfire S10 30 χ 250 mm (flow rate = 40 mL/min), or Cl8 PHENOMENEX® Luna S5 ODS 21 χ 100 mm (flow rate = 20 mL/min), or YMC S5 ODS 20 χ 100 mm (flow rate = 20 mL/min) or Waters XBridge C18 19 χ 250 mm (flow rate = 20 mL/min). Preparative Supercritical Fluid Chromatography (SFC) was performed using 78% C02/MeOH buffered with 0.1% diethylamine and detection at 220 nm on a CHIRALPAK® AS-H IDS 25 χ 3 cm column (flow rate = 85 mL/min). Unless otherwise specified, the various substituents of the compounds as employed herein are defined in the same manner as compounds of the invention of Formula (I).

Exemplary reagents and procedures for these reactions appear hereinafter and in the working examples. Protection and de-protection in the processes below may be carried out by procedures generally known in the art (see, for example, Greene, T.W. et al., Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, Wiley (1999)). General methods of organic synthesis and functional group transformations are found in: Trost, Β.Μ. et al., eds., Comprehensive Organic Synthesis: Selectivity, Strategy & Efficiency in Modern Organic Chemistry, Pergamon Press, New York, NY (1991); March, J., Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure. 4th Edition, Wiley & Sons, New York, NY (1992); Katritzky, A.R. et al., eds., Comprehensive Organic Functional Groups Transformations, 1st Edition, Elsevier Science Inc., Tarrytown, NY (1995); Larock, R.C., Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, NY (1989), and references therein. Methods for synthesis of enantiopure cis-iodocyclopropyl acid see Organic Process Research & Development 2004, 8, 353-359 Compounds of the invention I may be prepared according to the following schemes utilizing chemical transformations familiar to anyone of ordinary proficiency in the art of organic/medicinal chemistry. References to many of these transformations can be found in March’s Advanced Organic Chemistry Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, Fifth Edition by Michael Β. Smith and Jerry March, Wiley-Interscience, New York, 2001, or other standard texts on the topic of synthetic organic chemistry. Compounds (ζ) where Ζ is Cl, Br, or I and Q is a halogen are commercially available or can be prepared utilizing standard transformations known to those of ordinary proficiency in the art of organic/medicinal chemistry. Treatment of an alcohol or phenol RiOH and a base of suitable strength to deprotonate it, ideally in a solvent such as THF, DMF, ΝΜΡ followed by (i), affords adducts (ii). Depending upon the steric requirements and the degree of nucleophilicity of the alkoxide, heating may be required. Suitable bases for alcohols include, but are not be limited to, sodium hydride and organometallics such as Grignard or alkyllithium reagents. Typically, phenols are deprotonated with bases like sodium or potassium carbonate. Reduction of the nitro group in compounds (ii) to afford anilines (Hi) can be effected by various means including catalytic hydrogenation and dissolving metal reductions both in their various forms. See: Modem Synthetic Reactions, Second Edition by Herbert O. House, Benjamin Cummings, Menlo Park, California, 1972. A preferred method for effecting this reduction without removal of the halogen substituent Ζ involves stirring a solution of (ii) in a wet alcoholic solvent with an acid such as ammonium chloride and finely divided zinc. The aniline (iii) can be coupled with boronate ester dimers such as bis(neopentylglycolato)diboron by heating in a solvent such as DMSO, dioxane or DMF in the presence of a base such as potassium acetate and a catalyst such as Cl2Pd(dppf) to give aryl boronate esters (iv). Coupling of the boronic acid or ester (iv) with substituted cyclopropyl iodide of structure (ν), preferably under the conditions of Suzuki (See: Kotha, S. et al., Tetrahedron, 58:9633-9695 (2002)) affords compounds of general structure (vi). Typically, this reaction is performed by heating to around 95 °C the halide and the boronic acid or ester with a base such as aqueous tribasic sodium or potassium phosphate or sodium or potassium carbonate in a solvent such as dioxane, DMF, THF, or ΝΜΡ using a catalyst such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium or Cl2Pd(dppf). Many variations on this reaction involving the use of different temperatures, solvents, bases, anhydrous conditions, catalysts, boronate derivatives, and halide surrogates such as triflates are known to those skilled in the art of organic/medicinal chemistry. Recently, mild conditions have been reported for the coupling of sensitive boronic acid derivatives. See: Kinzel, Τ.; Zhang, Υ.; Buchwald, S. F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132(40), 14073-14075. Related coupling reactions for the conversion of (iv) and other intermediates described in later schemes into compounds of the invention include the Heck(olefin, See Heck, R. F. et al J. Org. Chem. 1979, (44), 4078), Stille(organostannane, See Stille, J. Κ. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1986, (25), 508), Sonogashira(acetylene See: Sonogashira, Κ.; Tohda, Υ.; Hagihara, Ν. Tetrahedron Fett. 1975, 16(50), 4467-4470.), and Negishi(organozinc) coupling reactions. Treatment of anilines (vi) with an isocyanate R9N=C=0, affords urea compounds of the invention I (Ζ = OR1). Typically, this reaction is performed in a solvent such as THF at a temperature between ambient and the boiling point of the solvent. Scheme 1 [Reduction] Τ |T ► Y*v^o R\ R6 R2^P^I R4Μ Suzuki or other coupling Scheme 2 describes a preparation of compounds of the invention I similar to that of Scheme 1 but with the transformations performed in a different order. In this scheme the Suzuki or related coupling is performed on intermediate (vii) to afford aniline (viii) which is derivatized by reaction of an isocyanate R9N=C=0 to afford compounds of the invention I (Ζ = OR1). Scheme 2 Treatment of compounds (i) with amines HNR7R8 (Scheme 4) and a suitable base in a solvent such as THF, DMF, ΝΜΡ, or the like affords intermediates (ix). Generally heating is required. Suitable bases include, but are not limited to aliphatic tertiary amines or an excess of the reacting primary or secondary amine HNR7R8. Reduction of nitroaromatics (ix) under the conditions described above affords the primary anilines (χ) which can be transformed into boronic acids and/or esters (xi) as in Scheme 1. Coupling of (xi) with a suitable cyclopropyliodide (ν), furnishes compound (xii) which can be treated with an isocyanate as described in Scheme 1 to give compounds of the invention I (Z = NR7R8). Scheme 3 was inadvertently omitted. Scheme 4 In Scheme 5 the order of synthetic steps is changed from that shown in Scheme 4. Accordingly, the aniline (χ) is functionalized by treatment with R9N=C=0 to give ureas (xiii). The ureas (xiii) can be converted to the boronic esters (xiv) by methods described previously. The boronic esters (xiv) can be couoled with the iodide (ν) via a Suzuki or related coupling reaction to afford compounds of the invention I. Scheme 5 Scheme 6 describes an additional method for the preparation of compounds of the invention I. Alternately, (χν) can react with primary or secondary amines HNR7R8, either in excess or in the presence of a suitable base such as an aliphatic tertiary amine, optionally in the presence of a solvent such as DMF or ΝΜΡ, at elevated temperature to provide adducts (xvi). Esters (xvi) may be converted to the corresponding carboxylic acids under various conditions familiar to those of ordinary skill in the art. Generally this is effected using an alkali metal hydroxide (ΜΟΗ) in aqueous solution, preferably with an organic co-solvent such as methanol or THF. Carboxylic acids (xvii) can be converted to acyl azides which rearrange (Curtius rearrangement) upon heating to form isocyanates which can be trapped by alcohols R’OH to furnish carbamates (xviii). Many variations on the Curtius rearrangement are familiar to those skilled in the art of organic/medicinal chemistry which have utility for the transformation of carboxylic acids such as (xvii) into carbamates (xviii) or the related amines (χ). Transformation of carbamates (xviii) into the corresponding anilines (χ) is effected in a manner which depends upon the nature of the R’ group. Typically, acidic conditions (~4M HC1 in dioxane or ~1:1 TFA-CH2CI2) are used for acid-labile carbamates (R’ = t-Bu). Benzylic carbamates are generally cleaved to the corresponding anilines by exposure to hydrogen gas in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as Pd or Pt or by phase transfer hydrogenolysis. Methods for transformation of anilines (χ) into compounds of the invention I are described in previous schemes. Scheme 6 OR' zYwYC02r 'sAq HNR7R8, base ZyWyC02R 1.) DPPA, base ► v*y^nr7r8 2.)

Intermediate (xiii) is further transformed using the Suzuki or related coupling into compounds of the invention I. Scheme 7 Intermediate (xii) is useful for preparation of further compounds of the invention as shown in Scheme 8. Treatment with a phenyl chloroformate derivative and a suitable base, generally in a solvent such as dichloromethane provides phenyl carbamate derivatives (xviii). Where greater reactivity than that available with derivatives of phenyl chloroformate(R = Η) is required, the related carbamates where R is an electronwithdrawing substituent such as a /;-nitro group may be employed. Suitable bases include but are not limited to pyridines and aliphatic tertiary amines. These derivatives may be isolated or used in the next reaction without isolation. In the event, they react with amines R9NH2 to give compounds of the invention I. Scheme 8 Intermediates prepared in the above schemes may require further elaboration in order to be converted into compounds of the invention. Examples of this are provided in the following schemes. Scheme 9 illustrates the conversion of nitriles (xix) into tetrazole compounds of the invention I. Typically, the nitrile is prepared by chemistry described above and heated with an azide such as tributyltinazide in a solvent such as toluene at or near the boiling point. This methodology could be used to prepare various cycloalkyl tetrazole derivatives. Scheme 9 Scheme 10 illustrates the transformation of intermediates or compounds of the invention into further intermediates or compounds of the invention by functional group interconversions. The boronic ester (xxi) described previously, can be coupled to the iodide (χχ) via a Suzuki or related coupling to give the ester (xxi). Hydroylsis of the ester (xxi) can be accomplished by treatment with hydroxide in aqueous or mixed aqueous/organic solvents to afford a compound of the invention I. Other conditions, (catalytic hydrogenation for benzylic esters, acid hydrolysis of t-butyl esters, for instance) may be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art. This methodology could be used to prepare heteroaromatic, cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl, or aliphatic acylsulfonamide derivatives in addition to the phenyl derivatives shown. As shown in Scheme 11, compounds (xxii) (prepared by the methods described above) may be coupled with carboxylic acids using peptide coupling reagents such as Bop, Pybop, HATU or a similar reagent and a suitable base in a solvent such as THF, DMF, ΝΜΡ, or the like to afford intermediates (xxiii). The use of such peptide coupling reagents has been reviewed by Han, S-Y et al., Tetrahedron, 60:2447-2467 (2004). Suitable bases include, but are not limited to aliphatic tertiary amines. Alternatively, amines (xxii) could react with acid chlorides of the formula R9CH2C0C1 to give amides (xxiii), again in a solvent in the presence of a base. Conversion of (xxiii) to compounds of the invention I is accomplished by hydrolysis of the ester by methods described previously to afford a compound of the invention I. Scheme 11 LiOH or other bases Scheme 12 describes methods to prepare cycloalkyl derivatives of 4-7 carbons. Cycloalkenes (xxiv) where η = 1-4, can be prepared by many methods known to one skilled in the art or are commercially available, can be coupled to the previously bromide (χ) via standard Heck coupling conditions to give the cycloalkene (χχν). The cycloalkene (χχν) can be reduced by several known methods, including by not limited to Pd/C and H2 in a solvent such as ethyl acetate to give the cycloalkane (xxvi). The aniline (xxvi) can then be treated sequentially with the isocyanates R9N=C=0 and an aqueous base, such as but not limited to LiOH as described previously, to give a compound of the invention I.

In scheme, the ethylene group can be installed via a Suzuki coupling of 2,4,6-trivinyl-1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxatriborinane and the aryl halide (ix) to give the styrene analog (xxxvii). The cyclopropyl ester (xxix) can be synthesized via a carbene generated with the diazoacetate (xxviii) and a Ru or Cu catalyst (reference). This will give a separable mixture of cis and trans cyclopropyl esters. Reduction of the nitro analog (xxix) will give the previously described aniline (xxii) which can be converted to a compound of formula I by methods previously described. v*y^nr7r8 (ix) (reduction) Pd(0) Scheme 13 ν,Λ y' 'nr7r8 Rhcata|yst (xxvii) O' nor v^y^nr7r8 (xxii) w no2 r | OR V*Y^NR7R8(xxix) Carboxylic acids (xxix), which are compounds of the invention I can be further elaborated to acyl sulfonamides, which are also compounds of the invention I. Several methods are known to one skilled in the art for the preparation of acyl sulfonamides from carboxylic acids, including treatment with a sulfonamide (χχχ) in presence of a coupling agent, such as EDC and a base such as TEA in a solvent such as DCM.
