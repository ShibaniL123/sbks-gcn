FINE DISSECTION ELECTRO SURGICAL DEVICE BACKGROUND [0001] The field of electrosurgery includes a number of loosely related surgical techniques which have in common the application of electrical energy to modify the structure or integrity of patient tissue. Electrosurgical procedures usually operate through the application of very high frequency currents to cut or ablate tissue structures, where the operation can be monopolar or bipolar. Monopolar techniques rely on a separate electrode for the return of current that is placed away from the surgical site on the body of the patient, and where the surgical device defines only a single electrode pole that provides the surgical effect. Bipolar devices comprise two or more electrodes on the same support for the application of current between their surfaces. [0002] Electrosurgical procedures and techniques are particularly advantageous since they generally reduce patient bleeding and trauma associated with cutting operations. Additionally, electrosurgical ablation procedures, where tissue surfaces and volume may be reshaped, cannot be duplicated through other treatment modalities. [0003] Radiofrequency (RF) energy is used in a wide range of surgical procedures because it provides efficient tissue resection and coagulation and relatively easy access to the target tissues through a portal or cannula. Conventional monopolar high frequency electrosurgical devices typically operate by creating a voltage difference between the active electrode and the target tissue, causing an electrical arc to form across the physical gap between the electrode and tissue. At the point of contact of the electric arcs with tissue, rapid tissue heating occurs due to high current density between the electrode and tissue. This high current density' causes cellular fluids to rapidly vaporize into steam, thereby producing a “cutting effect” along the pathway of localized tissue heating. Thus, the tissue is parted along the pathway of evaporated cellular fluid, inducing undesirable collateral tissue damage in regions surrounding the target tissue site. This collateral tissue damage often causes indiscriminate destruction of tissue, resulting in the loss of the proper function of the tissue. In addition, the device does not remove any tissue directly, but rather depends on destroying a zone of tissue and allowing the body to eventually remove the destroyed tissue. [0004] Present electrosurgical techniques used for tissue ablation may suffer from an inability to provide the ability for fine dissection of soft tissue. The distal end of electrosurgical devices is wide and flat, creating a relatively wide area of volumetric tissue removal and making fine dissections along tissue planes more difficult to achieve because of the lack of precision provided by the current tip geometries. In addition, identification of the plane is more difficult because the large ablated area and overall size of the device tip obscures the physician’s view of the surgical field. The inability to provide for fine dissection of soft tissue is a significant disadvantage in using electrosurgical techniques for tissue ablation, particularly in arthroscopic, otolaryngological, and spinal procedures. [0ΘΘ5] Traditional monopolar RF systems can provide fine dissection capabilities of soft tissue, but may also cause a high level of collateral thermal damage. Further, these devices may suffer from an inability to control the depth of necrosis in the tissue being treated. The high heat intensity generated by these systems causes burning and charring of the surrounding tissue, leading to increased pain and slower recovery of the remaining tissue. Further, the desire for an electrosurgical device to provide for fine dissection of soft tissue may compromise the ability to provide consistent ablative cutting without significant collateral damage while allowing for concomitant hemostasis and good coagulation of the remaining tissue. [0006] Accordingly, improved systems and methods are still desired for performing fine dissection of soft tissue via electrosurgical ablation of tissue. In particular, improved systems operable to provide a combination of smooth and precise cutting, effective concomitant hemostasis during cutting, and efficient coagulation ability in fine dissection soft tissue procedures would provide a competitive advantage.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0029] Before the various embodiments are described in detail, it is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to particular variations set forth herein as various changes or modifications may be made, and equivalents may be substituted, without departing from the scope of the disclosure. As will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading this disclosure, each of the individual embodiments described and illustrated herein has discrete components and features winch may be readily separated from or combined with the features of any of the other several embodiments without departing from the scope of the present invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation, material. composition of matter, process, process act(s) or step(s) to the objective(s), or scope of the present invention. All such modifications are intended to be within the scope of the claims made herein. [0030] Figure 1 illustrates an eiectrosurgical system 100 in accordance with at least some embodiments. In particular, the eiectrosurgical system comprises an eiectrosurgical wand 102 (hereinafter “wand”) coupled to an eiectrosurgical controller 104 (hereinafter “controller”). The wand 102 comprises an elongate shaft 106 that defines distal end 108 where at least some electrodes are disposed. The elongate shaft 106 further defines a handle or proximal end 110, where a physician grips the wand 102 during surgical procedures. The wand 102 further comprises a flexible multi-conductor cable 112 housing a plurality of electrical leads (not specifically shown in Figure 1), and the flexible multi-conductor cable 112 terminates in a wand connector 114. As shown in Figure 1, the wand 102 couples to the controller 104, such as by a controller connector 120 on an outer surface 122 (in the illustrative case of Figure 1, the front surface). [0031] Though not visible in the view' of Figure 1, in some embodiments the wand 102 has one or more internal fluid conduits coupled to externally accessible tubular members. As illustrated, the wand 102 has a flexible tubular member 116 and a second flexible tubular member 118. In some embodiments, the flexible tubular member 116 is used to provide electrically conductive fluid (e.g., saline) to the distal end 108 of the wand. Likewise in some embodiments, flexible tubular member 118 is used to provide aspiration to the distal end 108 of the wand. [0032] Still referring to Figure 1, a display device or interface panel 124 is visible through the outer surface 122 of the controller 104, and in some embodiments a user may select operational modes of the controller 104 by way of the interface device 124 and related buttons 126. [0033] In some embodiments the eiectrosurgical system 100 also comprises a foot pedal assembly 130. The foot pedal assembly 130 may comprise one or more pedal devices 132 and 134, a flexible multi-conductor cable 136 and a pedal connector 138. While only two pedal devices 132, 134 are shown, one or more pedal devices may be implemented. The outer surface 122 of the controller 104 may comprise a corresponding connector 140 that couples to the pedal connector 138. A physician may use the foot pedal assembly 130 to control various aspects of the controller 104, such as tire operational mode. For example, a pedal device, such as pedal device 132, may be used for on-off control of the application of radio frequency (KF) energy to the wand 102, and more specifically for control of energy in an ablation mode. A second pedal device, such as pedal device 134, may be used to control and/or set the operational mode of the electrosurgical system. For example, actuation of pedal device 134 may switch between energy levels of an ablation mode. [0034] The electrosurgical system 100 of the various embodiments may have a variety of operational modes. One such mode employs Coblation® technology. In particular, the assignee of the present disclosure is the owner of Coblation technology. Coblation technology involves the application of a radio frequency (RF) signal between one or more active electrodes and one or more return electrodes of the wand 102 to develop high electric field intensities in the vicinity' of the target tissue. The electric field intensities may be sufficient to vaporize an electrically conductive fluid over at least a portion of the one or more active electrodes in the region between the one or more active electrodes and the target tissue. The electrically conductive fluid may be inherently present in the body, such as blood, or in some cases extracelluar or intracellular fluid. In other embodiments, the electrically conductive fluid may be a liquid or gas, such as isotonic saline. In some embodiments, such as surgical procedures on a disc between vertebrae, the electrically conductive fluid is delivered in the vicinity of the active electrode and/or to the target site by the wand 102, such as by way of the internal passage and flexible tubular member 116. [0035] When the electrically conductive fluid is heated to the point that the atoms of the fluid vaporize faster than the atoms recondense, a gas is formed. When sufficient energy is applied to the gas, the atoms collide with each other causing a release of electrons in the process, and an ionized gas or plasma is formed (the so-called “fourth state of matter”). Stated otherwise, plasmas may be formed by heating a gas and ionizing the gas by driving an electric current through the gas, or by directing electromagnetic waves into the gas. The methods of plasma formation give energy to free electrons in the plasma directly, electron-atom collisions liberate more electrons, and the process cascades until the desired degree of ionization is achieved. A more complete description of plasma can be found in Plasma Physics, by R.J. Goldston and Ρ.Η. Rutherford of the Plasma Physics Laboratory of Princeton University (1995), the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. [0036] As the density of the plasma becomes sufficiently low (i.e., less than approximately 1020 atoms/cmJ for aqueous solutions), the electron mean free path increases such that subsequently injected electrons cause impact ionization within the plasma. When the ionic particles m the plasma layer have sufficient energy (e.g., 3.5 electron-Volt (eV) to 5 ℮Υ), collisions of the ionic particles with molecules that make up the target tissue break molecular bonds of the target tissue, dissociating molecules into free radicals which then combine into gaseous or liquid species. Often, the electrons in the plasma carry the electrical current or absorb the electromagnetic waves and, therefore, are hotter than the ionic particles. Thus, the electrons, which are carried away from the target tissue toward the active or return electrodes, carry most of the plasma’s heat, enabling the ionic particles to break apart the target tissue molecules in a substantially non-thermal manner. [0037] By means of the molecular dissociation (as opposed to thermal evaporation or carbonization), the target tissue is volumetrically removed through molecular dissociation of larger organic molecules into smaller molecules and/or atoms, such as hydrogen, oxygen, oxides of carbon, hydrocarbons and nitrogen compounds. The molecular dissociation completely removes the tissue structure, as opposed to dehydrating the tissue material by the removal of liquid within the cells of the tissue and extracellular fluids, as occurs in related art eiectrosurgical desiccation and vaporization. A more detailed description of the molecular dissociation can be found in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 5,697,882. [0038] In addition to the Coblation mode, the eiectrosurgical system 100 of Figure 1 may also in particular situations be useful for sealing larger arterial vessels (e.g., on the order of about 1 mm in diameter), when used in what is known as a coagulation mode. Thus, the system of Figure 1 may have an ablation mode where RF energy at a first voltage is applied to one or more active electrodes sufficient to effect molecular dissociation or disintegration of the tissue, and the system of Figure 1 may have a coagulation mode where RF energy at a second, lower voltage is applied to one or more active electrodes (either the same or different electrode(s) as the ablation mode) sufficient to heat, shrink, seal, fuse, and/or achieve homeostasis of se vered vessels within the tissue. [0039] The energy density produced by eiectrosurgical system 100 at the distal end 108 of the wand 102 may be varied by adjusting a variety of factors, such as: the number of active electrodes; electrode size and spacing; electrode surface area; asperities and/or sharp edges on the electrode surfaces; electrode materials; applied voltage; current limiting of one or more electrodes (e.g., by placing an inductor in series with an electrode); electrical conductivity of the fluid in contact with the electrodes; density of the conductive fluid; and other factors. Accordingly, these factors can be manipulated to control the energy level of the excited electrons. Because different tissue structures have different molecular bonds, the electrosurgical system 100 may be configured to produce energy sufficient to break the molecular bonds of certain tissue but insufficient to break the molecular bonds of other tissue. For example, fatty tissue (e.g., adipose) has double bonds that require an energy level higher than 4 ℮Υ to 5 eV (i.e., on the order of about 8 eV) to break. Accordingly, the Coblation'' technology in some operational modes does not ablate such fatty tissue; however, the Coblation ' technology at the lower energy levels may be used to effectively ablate cells to release the inner fat content in a liquid form. Other modes may have increased energy such that the double bonds can also be broken in a similar fashion as the single bonds (e.g., increasing voltage or changing the electrode configuration to increase the current density at the electrodes). [0040] A more complete description of the various phenomena can be found in commonly assigned IJ.S. Patent Nos. 6,355,032; 6 ,149,120 and 6 ,296,136. [0041] Fig. 2Α illustrates a perspective view of the distal end 108 of wand 102 in accordance with at least some embodiments. In some embodiments, a portion of the elongate shaft 106 may be made of a metallic material (e.g.. Grade ΤΡ304 stainless steel hypodermic tubing). In other embodiments, portions of the elongate shaft may be constructed of ο ther suitable materials, such as inorganic insulating materials. The elongate shaft 106 may define a circular cross-section at the handle or proximal end 110 (not shown in Figure 2), and at least a portion of the distal end 108 may be flattened to define an elliptical or semi-circular cross-section. [0042] In embodiments where the elongate shaft is metallic, the distal end 108 may further comprise a non-conductive spacer 200 coupled to the elongate shaft 106. In some cases the spacer 200 is ceramic, but other non-conductive materials resistant to degradation when exposed to plasma may be equivalently used (e.g., glass). The spacer 200 supports electrodes of conductive material, with illustrative active electrode labeled 202 in Figure 2Α, Active electrode 202 defines an exposed surface area of conductive material, where active electrode 202 is a loop of wire of particular diameter. For embodiments using a loop of wire, the loop of wire may be molybdenum or tungsten having a diameter between and including 0.025 and 0.035 inches, and more preferably of 0.030 inches, and having an exposed standoff distance away from the spacer 200 of approximately 0.080 inches. Spacer 200 may have a step feature 201 that serves to limit the depth of penetration of active electrode 202 by providing a non-conduc-tive surface to rest on adjacent tissue, thereby allowing for a more controlled and precise cut as well as providing for a more uniform depth of thermal effect in tissue. Further, spacer 200 may define an elliptical or semi-circular cross-section to provide a flattened support profile for active electrode 202. [0Θ43] In certain embodiments, the active electrode has an edge feature 203 at a specific, distinct location advantageous for enhanced plasma formation. In particular, active electrode 202 may be defined by an edge feature 203 (e.g., a scalloped portion, a cut, divot, or asperity) having a cut diameter and depth between and including 0.008 and 0.0012 inches, and more preferably of approximately 0.010 inches on each side, leaving a thin segment of approximately 0.010 inches thickness in the central portion of active electrode 202. Referring to Fig. 2Β, edge feature 203 is preferably located in at least two positions on opposed sides of a plane Pi bisecting the wire diameter of active electrode 202, and centered about a second plane P2 bisecting the width of active electrode 202. Fig. 2C shows a cross-sectional view of active electrode 202 and spacer 200 taken substantially along plane P2 of Fig. 2Β. In particular, Fig. 2C shows the orientation of edge feature 203 in an embodiment where the feature is a pair of symmetric cuts in active electrode 202. In certain other embodiments contemplated but not shown, edge feature 203 can also be a protruding section along active electrode 202 formed through a coining, welding, or other forming operation to provide exterior edges for improved localized plasma formation in these areas. Edge feature 203 at the distal tip of active electrode 202 helps initiate localized plasma formation in the relative center of active electrode 202 for smooth cutting. Referring briefly to Figs. 3Α and 3Β, active electrode 202 further has rounded edges or a smooth feature 203b at a second, distinct location away from edge feature 203 for conductive/resistive heating of tissue at locations spaced away from edge feature 203. In particular, active electrode 202 may be loop of wire characterized by edge feature 203 at the apex of the loop and smooth feature 203b adjacent to edge feature 203 and disposed on either side of the loop forming active electrode 202. This conductive heating of surrounding tissue helps provide concomitant hemostasis of small blood vessels while plasma is initiated for cutting. [0044] Referring again to Fig. 2Α, wand 102 includes a return electrode 204 for completing the current path between active electrode 202 and controller 104. Return electrode 204 is preferably a semi-annular member defining the exterior of shaft 106, and a distal portion of return electrode 204 is preferably exposed. Return electrode 204 is suitably connected to controller 104. At least a proximal portion of return electrode 204 is disposed within an electrically insulative sheath 206, which is typically formed as one or more electrically insulative sheaths or coatings, such as polytetrafluoroethylene, polyimide, and the like. The provision of the electrically insulative sheath 206 encircling over a portion of return electrode 204 prevents direct electrical contact between return electrode 204 and any adjacent body structure or the surgeon. Such direct electrical contact between a body structure (e.g., tendon) and an exposed common electrode member 204 could result in unwanted heating and necrosis of the structure at the point of contact causing necrosis. [0045] Return electrode 204 is preferably formed from an electrically conductive material, usually metal, which is selected from the group consisting of stainless steel alloys, platinum or its alloys, titanium or its alloys, molybdenum or its alloys, and nickel or its alloys. Referring now to Fig. 3Α, the distance D between active electrode 202 and return electrode 204 is preferably kept substantially constant. As such, it is preferred that the distal projection of return electrode 204 have a non-uniform shape to approximate the geometry of active electrode 202, In a preferred embodiment, return electrode 204 has an extended feature in the form of tab 205 extending distally. This extension tab 205 maintains a near-uniform distance between the active loop electrode 202 and return electrode 204. Preferably, the extended tab 205 closes the distance between the return electrode 204 and the active electrode 202 as measured at the apex of the active loop electrode 202, thereby keeping the distance D between all portions of the active and return electrodes substantially constant. It also brings lire distal end of the return electrode 204 closer to the targeted tissue to improve the conduction of current through tissue and saline between the active and return electrodes. This enables a more uniform and continuous delivery of electrical current through the targeted tissue during coagulation mode, providing greater depth of thermal penetration for improved coagulation of blood vessels. [0046] In some embodiments saline is delivered to the distal end 108 of wand, possibly to aid in plasma creation. Referring again to Figs. 2Α and 2Β, discharge apertures 208 are illustrated on the distal end 108 spaced proximally from return electrode 204. Discharge apertures 208 are formed at the distal most point of the msulative sheath 206 encircling a portion of return electrode 204. Insulative sheath 206 further creates an annular gap between the insulative sheath and return electrode 204, in which multiple axially disposed ribs are spaced equally throughout to form a plurality7 of fluid flow channels 209 that direct discharged conductive fluid toward the return electrode 204 and active electrode 202. Discharge apertures 208 characterize the distal most opening of the associated plurality of flow channels 209. In the particular embodiment illustrated, eight discharge apertures are shown, but fewer or greater numbers of discharge apertures are contemplated. The discharge apertures 208 are fluidly coupled to the flexible tubular member 116 (Figure 1) by way7 of a fluid conduit within the wand 102. Thus, saline or other fluid may be pumped into the flexible tubular member 116 (Figure I) and discharged through the plurality of fluid flow channels 209 and discharge apertures 208 to further aid in developing consistent wetting around the circumference of return electrode 204. [0047] In yet still further embodiments, aspiration is provided at the distal end 108 of the wand 102. Fig. 3Β illustrates aspiration aperture 207 (ΐ.℮., suction port 207) at the distal end 108 of the device and disposed through the non-conductive spacer 200 and defining in part an opening in return electrode 204. Suction port 207 is disposed at distal end 108 and m certain embodiments preferably only located on one side of spacer 200 and disposed on an inferior surface of spacer 200 (such that when in use the suction port 207 is preferably disposed inferiorly with regard to the angle of approach to the target tissue), and accordingly may be disposed on the opposite side of spacer 200 from tab 205. Suction port 207 aspirates the area near the distal end 108, such as to remove excess fluids and remnants of ablation. The location of suction port 207 further provides for ample wetting of the active and return electrodes on the opposing side of the tip, with the saline flowing down from discharge apertures 208 on tire non-suction side of the shaft, around the active electrode tip, then pulled back up on the inferior side of the wand with suction port 207. Applicants have found it is particularly beneficial to direct conductive fluid flow to discrete areas away from the suction port 207 to provide broader wetting of the exposed surface of return electrode 204, enabling more uniform plasma formation. [0048] Additionally, referring briefly to both Fig. 2Β and 3Β, suction port 207 may be offset inferior from plane Pi, which also bisects the thickness Τ of distal end 108 of elongate shaft 106. Fig. 3C shows a cross-section view taken substantially along plane Ρ¾ of Fig. 2Β. In particular, Fig. 3C shows suction port 207 as well as spacer fluid conduit 210 defined by walls 212. Fluid conduit 210 further comprises an aspiration chamber 216 having a fluid conduit opening 214. In operation, suction is provided to the flexible tubular member 118 (Fig. 1), and flexible tubular member 118 either extends into the internal volume of the wand 102 to become, or fluidly couples to, opening 214 of aspiration chamber 216. Thus, conductive fluid, molecularly dissociated tissue, as well as tissue pieces are drawn through the suction post 207, into the fluid conduit 210, and eventually through aspiration chamber 216 and opening 214. Aspiration chamber 216 is spaced proximally from suction port 207, and the inventors of the present specification have found that a particular depth of aspiration chamber 216 and width of opening 214 work better than others. For example, without the increased area of aspiration chamber 216, the fluid conduit 210 may be subject to clogging. Likewise, if the coupling point for flexible tubular member 118 at opening 114 does not have an increased diameter, clogging may occur. In accordance with at least some embodiments, the nature of fluid conduit 210 transitions over a length L between suction port. 207 and opening 214. The entrance to the fluid conduit 210 is referenced by an aspiration aperture width Wa. In accordance with at least some embodiments the internal walls 212 that define fluid conduit 210 smoothly transition to a change in width referenced by an opening width W0 at opening 214 over length I, wherein the width change to W0 at opening 214 should be at least half the full ID of the shaft. Additionally, referring again now to Fig. 2C, the depth of fluid conduit 210 as it transitions to aspiration chamber 216 should smoothly vary at least to a depth referenced by depth Dc, wherein the apex of depth Dc should he at least half the thickness Τ (Fig. 2Β) of spacer 200 and then smoothly transitioning to a depth D0 at opening 214. The inventors present the nature of fluid conduit 210 as described above by way of example only. Other variances and transitions in the shape, respective widths, and depths of portions of fluid conduit 210 and aspiration chamber 216 from suction port 207 to opening 214 may be equivalently used. [0049] As shown for example in Figs. 2Α-3Β, return electrode 204 is not directly connected to active electrode 202. To complete a current path so that active electrode 202 is electrically connected to return electrode 204 in the presence of a target tissue, electrically conducting liquid (e.g., isotonic saline) is caused to flow along liquid paths emanating from discharge apertures 208 and contacting both return electrode 204 and active electrode 202. When a voltage difference is applied between active electrode 202 and return electrode 204, high electric field intensities will be generated at the distal tip of active electrode 202 with current flow from active electrode 202 to the return electrode 204, the high electric field intensities causing ablation of target tissue adjacent the distal tip of active electrode 202. [0050] Figure 4A shows a cross-sectional elevation view of a wand 102 m accordance with at least some embodiments. In particular, Figure 4 shows the handle or proximal end 110 coupled to the elongate shaft 106. As illustrated, the elongate shaft 106 telescopes within the handle, but other mechanisms to couple the elongate shaft to the handle may be equivalently used. The elongate shaft 106 defines internal conduit 400 that serves several purposes. For example, in the embodiments illustrated by Figure 4 the electrical leads 402 and 404 extend through the internal conduit 400 to electrically couple to the active electrode 202 and return electrode 204, respectively. Likewise, the flexible tubular member .116 extends through the internal conduit 400 to fluidly couple to the plurality of flow channels 209 and discharge apertures 208 via msulative sheath 206, [0051] The internal conduit 400 also selves as the aspiration route. In particular, Figure 4Β illustrates suction port 207. In the embodiments illustrated the flexible tubular member 118, through which aspiration is performed, couples through the handle and then fluidly couples to the internal conduit 400. Thus, the suction provided through flexible tubular member 118 provides aspiration at the suction port 207. The fluids that are drawn into the internal fluid conduit 400 may abut the portion of the flexible tubular member 116 that resides within the internal conduit as the fluids are drawn along the conduit; however, the flexible tubular member 116 is sealed, and thus the aspirated fluids do not mix with the fluid (e.g., saline) being pumped through the flexible tubular member 116. Likewise, the fluids that are drawn into the internal fluid conduit 400 may abut portions of the electrical leads 402 and 404 within the internal fluid conduit 400 as the fluids are drawn along the conduit. However, the electrical leads are insulated with an insulating material that electrically and fluidly isolates the leads from any substance within the internal fluid conduit 400. Thus, the internal fluid conduit serves, m the embodiments shown, two purposes - one to be the pathway through winch the flexible tubular member 116 and electrical leads traverse to reach the distal end 108, and also as the conduit through which aspiration takes place. In other embodiments, the flexible tubular member 118 may extend partially or fully through the elongate shaft 106, and thus more directly couple to the aspiration apertures. [0052] Figures 4Α and 4Β also illustrate that, in accordance with at least some embodiments, a portion of the elongate shaft 106 is circular (e.g., portion 410) and another portion of the elongate shaft 106 is flattened (e.g., portion 412) to define an elliptical or semi-circular cross-section. In some embodiments, the distal 3 centimeters or less is flattened, and in some cases the last 2 centimeters. In other embodiments, the entire elongate shaft may define the elliptical or semi-circular cross-section. Additionally, in the particular embodiments illustrated the angle between the axis of portion 410 and the axis of portion 412 is non-zero, and in some embodiments the acute angle between the axis of portion 410 and the axis of portion 412 is 20 degrees, but greater or lesser angles may be equivalently used. [0053] As illustrated in Figure 1, flexible multi-conductor cable 112 (and more particularly its constituent electrical leads 402, 404 and possibly others) couple to the wand connector 114. Wand connector 114 couples the controller 104, and more particularly the controller connector 120. Figure 5 shows both a cross-sectional view (right) and an end elevation view (left) of wand connector 114 in accordance with at least some embodiments. In particular, wand connector 114 comprises a tab 500, Tab 500 works in conjunction with a slot on controller connector 120 (shown in Figure 6) to ensure that the wand connector 114 and controller connector 120 only couple in one relative orientation. The illustrative wand connector 114 further comprises a plurality of electrical pins 502 protruding from wand connector 114. In many cases, the electrical pins 502 are coupled one each to an electrical lead of electrical leads 504 (two of which may be leads 402 and 404 of Figure 4). Stated otherwise, in particular embodiments each electrical pin 502 couples to a single electrical lead, and thus each illustrative electrical pin 502 couples to a single electrode of the wand 102. In other cases, a single electrical pin 502 couples to multiple electrodes on the eleetrosurgicaf wand 102. While Figure 5 shows four illustrative electrical pins, in some embodiments as few as two electrical pins, and as many as 26 electrical pins, may be present in the wand connector 114. [0054] Figure 6 shows both a cross-sectional view (right) and an end elevation view (left) of controller connector 120 in accordance with at least some embodiments. In particular, controller connector 120 comprises a slot 600. Slot 600 works in conjunction with a tab 500 on wand connector 114 (show-n in Figure 5) to ensure that the wand connector 114 and controller connector 120 only couple in one orientation. The illustrative controller connector 120 further comprises a plurality of electrical pins 602 residing within respective holes of controller connector 120. The electrical pins 602 are coupled to terminals of a voltage generator within the controller 104 (discussed more thoroughly below-). When wand connector 114 and controller connector 120 are coupled, each electrical pin 602 couples to a single electrical pin 502. While Figure 6 shows only four illustrative electrical pins, in some embodiments as few- as two electrical pins, and as many as 26 electrical pins may be present in the wand connector 120. [0055] While illustrative wand connector 114 is shown to have the tab 500 and male electrical pins 502, and controller connector 120 is shown to have the slot 600 and female electrical pins 602, in alternative embodiments the wand connector has the female electrical pins and slot and the controller connector 120 has the tab and male electrical pins, or other combination. In other embodiments, the arrangement of the pins within the connectors may enable only a single orientation for connection of the connectors, and thus the tab and slot arrangement may be omitted. In yet still other embodiments, other mechanical arrangements to ensure the wand connector and controller connector couple in only one orientation may be equivalently used. In the case of a wand with only two electrodes, and which electrodes may be either active or return electrodes as the physical situation dictates, there may be no need to ensure the connectors couple in a particular orientation. [0056] Figure 7 illustrates a controller 104 in accordance with at least some embodiments. In particular, the controller 104 comprises a processor 700, The processor 700 may be a microcontroller, and therefore the microcontroller may be integral with random access memory (RAM) 702, read-only memory (RAM) 704, digital-to-analog converter (D/A) 706, digital outputs (D/O) 708 and digital inputs (D/I) 710. The processor 700 may further provide one or more externally available peripheral busses, such as a serial bus (e.g., I"C), parallel bus, or other bus and corresponding communication mode. The processor 700 may further be integral with a communication logic 712 to enable the processor 700 to communicate with external devices, as well as internal devices, such as display device 124. Although in some embodiments the controller 104 may implement a microcontroller, in yet other embodiments the processor 700 may be implemented as a standalone central processing unit in combination with individual RAM, ROM, communication, D/A, DO and D/I devices, as well as communication port hardware for communication to peripheral components. [0057] ROM 704 stores instructions executable by the processor 700. In particular, the ROM 704 may comprise a software program that implements the various embodiments of periodically reducing voltage generator output to change position of the plasma relative to the electrodes of the wand (discussed more below), as well as interfacing with the user by way of the display device 124 and/or the foot pedal assembly 130 (Figure 1). The RAM 702 may be the working memory for the processor 700, where data may be temporarily stored and from which instructions may be executed. Processor 700 couples to other devices within the controller 104 by way of the D/A converter 706 (e.g., the voltage generator 716), digital outputs 708 (e.g., the voltage generator 716), digital inputs 710 (i.e., push button switches 126, and the foot pedal assembly 130 (Figure 1)), and other peripheral devices. [0058] Voltage generator 716 generates selectable alternating current (AC) voltages that are applied to the electrodes of the wand 102. In the various embodiments, the voltage generator defines two terminals 724 and 726. In accordance with the various embodiments, the voltage generator generates an alternating current (AC) voltage across the terminals 724 and 726. In at least some embodiments the voltage generator 716 is electrically “floated” from the balance of the supply power in the controller 104, and thus the voltage on terminals 724, 726, when measured with respect to the earth ground or common (e.g., common 728) within the controller 104, may or may not show a voltage difference even when the voltage generator 716 is active. [0059] The voltage generated and applied between the active terminal 724 and return terminal 726 by the voltage generator 716 is a RF signal that in some embodiments, has a frequency of between about 5 kilo-Hertz (kHz) and 20 Mega-Hertz (MHz), in some cases being between about 30 kHz and 2.5 MHz, often between about 100 kHz and 200 kHz. In applications associated with otolaryngology-head and neck procedures, a frequency of about 100 kHz appears most effective. The RMS (root mean square) voltage generated by the voltage generator 716 may be in the range from about 5 Volts (V) to 1000 V, preferably being in the range from about 10 V to 500 V, often between about 100 V to 350 V depending on the active electrode size and the operating frequency. The peak-to-peak voltage generated by the voltage generator 716 for ablation or cutting in some embodiments is a square wave form m the range of 10 V to 2000 V and in some cases in the range of 100 V to 1800 V and in other cases in the range of about 28 V to 1200 V, often in the range of about 100 V to 320 V peak-to-peak (again, depending on the electrode size and the operating frequency). [0060] Still referring to the voltage generator 716, the voltage generator 716 delivers average power levels ranging from several milliwatts to hundreds of watts per electrode, depending on the voltage applied for the target tissue being treated, and/or the maximum allowed temperature selected for the wand 102. The voltage generator 716 is configured to enable a user to select the voltage level according to the specific requirements of a particular procedure. A description of one suitable voltage generator 716 can be found in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 6,142,992 and 6,235,020, the complete disclosure of both patents are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. [0061] In some embodiments, the various operational modes of the voltage generator 716 may be controlled by way of digital-to-analog converter 706. That is, for example, the processor 700 may control the output voltage by providing a variable voltage to the voltage generator 716, where the voltage provided is proportional to the voltage generated by the voltage generator 716. In other embodiments, the processor 700 may communicate with the voltage generator by way of one or more digital output signals from the digital output 708 device, or by way of packet based communications using the communication device 712 (connection not specifically shown so as not to unduly complicate Figure 8). [0062] Figure 7 also shows a simplified side view of the distal end 108 of the wand 102. As shown, illustrative active electrode 202 of the wand 102 electrically couples to terminal 724 of the voltage generator 716 by way of the connector 120, and return electrode 204 electrically couples to terminal 726 of the voltage generator 716. [0063] Figure 8 shows a method in accordance with at least some embodiments. In particular, the method starts (block 800) and proceed to: flowing a conductive fluid within a fluid conduit disposed within a electrosurgical wand, the conductive fluid discharges through a plurality of discharge apertures and flows past a return electrode disposed distally from the fluid conduit, and is then discharged over an active electrode (block 802); applying electrical energy between the active electrode and the return electrode (block 804); forming, responsive to the energy, a localized plasma proximate to an edge feature disposed on the active electrode (block 806); ablating, by the localized plasma, a portion of a target tiss ue proximate to the edge feature (block 808); and heating, responsive to the energy, the target tissue at locations spaced away from the edge feature to thereby provide concomitant hemostasis (block 810). And thereafter the method ends (block 812). [0064] The above discussion is meant to be illustrative of the principles and various embodiments of the present invention.
