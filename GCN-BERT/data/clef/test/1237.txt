Example 6: Synthesis of compound 11109, N-(2-fluoro-4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)-N-phenylisonicotinamide
[Step 1] Synthesis of methyl 3-fluoro-4-((N-phenylisonicotinamido)methyl)benzoate
Methyl 3-fluoro-4-((phenylamino)methyl)benzoate (0.640 g, 2.468 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.638 g, 4.937 mmol) were dissolved in methylene chloride (10 mL) at room temperature, and isonicotinoyl chloride hydrochloride (0.879 g, 4.937 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 12 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 80%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.840 g, 93.4%) as a yellow foam solid.
