Step 3: Preparation of 4-chloro-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)-7,8-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(6H)-one
4-methoxybenzylamine (1.1 equivalent) was dissolved in anhydrous CH2CL2 (5 mL) , which was slowly added to the reaction mixture comprising 300 mg (1.48 mmol) of 1-(4,6-dichloropyrimidine-5-yl)propene-2-en-1-one prepared in step 2, DIPEA (1.1 equivalent), and anhydrous CH2CL2 (15 mL) at 0Â° C. The mixture was heated at room temperature, followed by stirring for 1 hour. The reaction mixture was added with 1N HCl (5 mL), followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The extracted organic layer was washed with saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution, separated, dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate, 2/1) to give 413 mg of the target compound 4-chloro-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)-7,8-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(6H)-one as a pale yellow solid (1.36 mmol, yield: 92%).
