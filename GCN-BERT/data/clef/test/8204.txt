(Reference Example 8) Synthesis of ethyl 1-(difluoromethyl)-1H-imidazole-2-carboxylate:
Potassium carbonate (1.28 g, 9.28 mmol) and sodium chlorodifluoroacetate (1.31 g, 8.56 mmol) were added to a solution of ethyl 1H-imidazole-2-carboxylate (1.00 g, 7.14 mmol) in acetonitrile (35 mL) at room temperature and the resultant mixture was stirred at 60°C for 24 hours. Further, potassium carbonate (0.640 g, 4.63 mmol) and sodium chlorodifluoroacetate (0.660 g, 4.33 mmol) were added at room temperature and the reaction liquid was stirred at 80°C for 8 hours. The reaction liquid was cooled to room temperature and distilled water was added to the reaction liquid and the reaction liquid was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with a 10% aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (silica gel, hexane/ethyl acetate) to obtain ethyl 1-(difluoromethyl)-1H-imidazole-2-carboxylate (0.838 g, 4.41 mmol, 62%) as a colorless oil.
