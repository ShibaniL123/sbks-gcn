Step 3
To Compound 189 (7.00 g, 20.5 mmol) in dichloromethane (35 mL) and methanol (35 mL) solution were added calcium carbonate (2.67 g, 26.7 mmol) and benzyltrimethylammonium dichloroiodate (8.56 g, 24.6 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 hours. Under ice-cooling, 10% sodium bisulfite (100 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (100 mL) were added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (300 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (30 mL) and saturated brine (30 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration, the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 190 (8.42 g, 88% yield) as a brown solid.
