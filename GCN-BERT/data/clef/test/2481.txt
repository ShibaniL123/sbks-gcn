CA 02716060 2010-09-30 SEAL ANCHOR WITH NON-PARALLEL LUMENS [00011 BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field [0002] The present disclosure relates to a seal for use in a surgical procedure. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a seal anchor member adapted for insertion into an incision in tissue and including a plurality of non-parallel lumens adapted for the sealed reception of one or more surgical objects such that a substantially fluid-tight seal is formed with both the tissue and the surgical object or objects. 2. Background of the Related Art [0003] Today, many surgical procedures are performed through small incisions in the skin, as compared to the larger incisions typically required in traditional procedures, in an effort to reduce both trauma to the patient and recovery time. Generally, such procedures are referred to as "endoscopic", unless performed on the patient's abdomen, in which case the procedure is referred to as "laparoscopic". Throughout the present disclosure, the term "minimally invasive" should be understood to encompass both endoscopic and laparoscopic procedures. [0004] During a typical minimally invasive procedure, surgical objects, such as surgical access devices (e.g., trocar and cannula assemblies) or endoscopes, are inserted into the patient's body through an incision in tissue. In general, prior to the introduction of the surgical object or CA 02716060 2010-09-30 instrument into the patient's body, insufflation gasses are used to enlarge the area surrounding the target surgical site to create a larger, more accessible work area. Accordingly, the maintenance of a substantially fluid-tight seal is desirable so as to prevent the escape of the insuffiation gases and the deflation or collapse of the enlarged surgical site. [00i5] To this end, various valves and seals are used during the course of minimally invasive procedures and are widely known in the art. Various seals have been developed including lumens for the reception of surgical instruments. Depending upon the needs of a particular surgical procedure, instruments may need to be angled with respect to one another for extended periods of time. Holding the instruments at angles with respect to one another and/or overcoming the internal biases of the seal anchor member through which the instruments are inserted may fatigue the surgeon and/or breach the fluid-tight barrier between the seal anchor member and surrounding tissue. [0006] Accordingly, a continuing need exists for new seal anchor members that can be inserted directly into the incision in tissue and that can accommodate a variety of surgical objects or instruments while maintaining the integrity of an insuffiated workspace. SUMMARY [0007] Disclosed herein is a seal anchor member including a housing including leading and trailing ends, and one or more lumens extending therethrough. Each of the lumens is adapted for receiving a surgical instrument in a substantially sealed reception. The one or more lumens are angled with respect to a longitudinal axis of the housing. At least two of the lumens define axes that are non-parallel with respect to one another. In an embodiment, the housing may include a plurality of lumens, e.g., three lumens, in which one of the lumens is parallel with respect to the longitudinal axis and the other two lumens are non-parallel with respect to each CA 02716060 2010-09-30 other and the longitudinal axis. As described herein, the lumens, while defining axes that are intersecting, do not cross each other since the lumens are laterally spaced apart, e.g., the axes, not the lumens, are intersecting when the housing is viewed in a side cross-sectional view. This arrangement of the lumens facilitates the simultaneous, non-parallel placement of multiple surgical objects or instruments within the seal anchor member. However, in other embodiments, the lumens may be intersecting. [0008] Furthermore, the lumens may define openings at the leading end that are radially spaced apart about the trailing end. Alternatively, the lumens may define openings at the leading end that are spaced along a diameter of the trailing end, The openings defined by the lumens may be staggered about an axis of the trailing end or may be positioned along a diameter but offset from that diameter. Alternatively, the openings defined by the lumens may be positioned on a chord or a diameter of the trailing end. [0009] The housing may be formed from a compressible material to facilitate adjusting the angles between instruments inserted within the lumens and with respect to the longitudinal axis of the housing. In the absence of a force, e.g, a radial force, upon the instruments inserted within the lumens, the lumens are angled, i.e., non-parallel, with respect to each other. Duñng use, the angles of the lumens are adjustable by applying a force. [0010] The leading end may include a groove, cut-out, or recess that is positioned adjacent to the proximal end of at least one of the lumens. The groove is configured and adapted to facilitate the insertion of the instrument into the lumen by stabilizing the instrument and leading the instrument into the lumen. The groove may be generally arcuate. The groove may narrow from the proximal end to the distal end of the groove. The groove may extend radially outward from the proximal end of the at least one lumen. CA 02716060 2010-09-30 [0011] Furthermore, the housing of the seal anchor may be adapted to transition between a first compressed condition to facilitate at least partial insertion of the seal anchor member within a tissue tract, and a second expanded condition to facilitate securing of the seal anchor member within the tissue tract and in substantial sealed relation with tissue surfaces defining the tissue tract. In an embodiment, the housing may be formed from a compressible material or from a foam material. In an embodiment, the foam material may be at least partially constituted of a material selected from the group consisting ofpolyisoprene, urethane, and silicone. In another embodiment, the housing may be formed from a gel material. [0012] The housing may also define a substantially arcuate configuration. The housing may define a substantially hour glass shape. Furthermore, the lumens may define openings at the leading end that are radially spaced apart about the trailing end. Alternatively, the lumens may define openings at the leading end that are spaced along a diameter of the trailing end. The openings defined by the lumens may be staggered about an axis of the trailing end or may be positioned along a diameter but offset from that diameter. Alternatively, the openings defined by the lumens may be positioned on a chord or a diameter of the trailing end. [0013] These and other features of the apparatus disclosed herein will become more readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description of various embodiments of the present disclosure. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0014] Various embodiments of the present disclosure are described hereinbelow with references to the drawings, wherein: [0015] Fig. 1 is a front perspective view of a seal anchor in accordance with the present disclosure shown relative to tissue; CA 02716060 2010-09-30 [0016] Fig. 2A is a front perspective view of a seal anchor member having lumens therein that are parallel to one another; [0017] Fig. 2B is a front perspective view of the seal anchor of Fig. 1 shown with medical instruments inserted therein; [0018] Fig. 3 is another embodiment of a seal anchor in accordance with the present disclosure; and [0019] Fig. 4 is a yet another embodiment of a seal anchor in accordance with the present disclosure. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS [0020] In the drawings and in the description which follows, in which like references numerals identify similar or identical elements, the term "proximal" will refer to the end of the apparatus which is closest to the clinician during use, while the term "distal" will refer to the end which is furthest from the clinician, as is traditional and known in the art. A seal anchor for use in a surgical procedure is shown and described in U.S. Pat. Pub. 2009-0093752, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The seal anchor member may be used during a minimally invasive procedure in which the seal anchor is inserted into an incision. Alternatively, the seal anchor may be used through a naturally occurring opening (e.g., anus or vagina) or any incision in a patient's skin. 10021] The use and function of seal anchor member 100 will be discussed during the course of a typical minimally invasive procedure. Initially, the peritoneal cavity (not shown) is insufflated with a suitable biocompatible gas such as, e.g., CO2 gas, such that the cavity wall is raised and lifted away from the internal organs and tissue housed thereín, providing greater access thereto. The insufflation may be performed with an insufflation needle or similar device, CA 02716060 2010-09-30 as is conventional in the art. Either prior or subsequent to insuffiation, a tissue tract 12 is created in tissue "T", the dimensions of which may be varied dependent upon the nature of the procedure. [0022] A seal anchor 100 will now be described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. The seal anchor 100 defines a longitudinal axis "A" and has respective trailing (or proximal) and leading (or distal) ends 102, 104 and an intermediate portion 106 disposed between the trailing and leading ends 102, 104. Seal anchor member 100 includes one or more lumens (or ports) 10Sa, 108b, 108c disposed between the trailing and leading ends 102, 104 that define corresponding longitudinal axes "X", "Y", "Z". As seen in Fig. l, the axes "X", "Y", "Z" defined by the lumens 10Sa, 108b, 108c, respectively, are non-parallel with respect to one another. To facilitate the simultaneous placement of instruments into each of the lumens 108a, !08b, 108c, the lumens 108a-c do not cross one another. The lumens 108a-c are laterally spaced apart such that, although the lumens 108a-c are angled with respect to one another, the lumens 108a-c do not intersect one another. In other embodiments, however, lumens may be arranged to cross one another. In contrast to seal anchor 100, a seal anchor 90 having parallel, non-intersecting lumens 98 is illustrated in Fig. 2A. [0023] As seen in Fig. 2B, the lumens 108a-c are adapted to receive instrumentation therein in a substantially sealed manner. The lumens 108a-c are adapted to inhibit the escape of insuffiation gasses within a body cavity with or without instrumentation being inserted therein. Accordingly, the lumens 108a-c have diameters that are adapted to contract in the absence of a surgical instrument inserted therein and are adapted to expand to accommodate instrumentation in a substantially sealed manner. CA 02716060 2010-09-30 [0024] As shown in Fig. 2B, the instrumentation inserted within the lumens 108 may include, but are not limited to, a camera 20 that may be inserted within one of the lumens 108 and a pair of surgical instruments 21 that are inserted into two of the other lumens 108. Since the axes "X" and "Z" of the two lumens 108a, 108c, through which the pair of surgical instruments 21 are inserted, cross one another, the distance between the distal ends of the surgical instruments 21 is greater than it would be if the axes 'iX", "Z" were parallel to one another. Since the lumens 108a, 108c define non-parallel axes, manipulation of the surgical instruments 21 is facilitated since there is a lesser probability of the instruments 21 interfering with each other's use. Furthermore, since the at-rest state for the lumens 108a-c is at angles with respect to one another, surgeon fatigue is reduced for those procedures necessitating such positioning for an extended duration of time. Adjustment of the angles of the lumens with respect to one another is facilitated by overcoming the internal biasing force of the seal anchor member 100 by applying a radial force to the surgical instrumentation placed within the lumens 108a-c. [00251 As previously discussed, Fig. 2A illustrates a seal anchor 90 including lumens 98 that are parallel to one another. Inserted within lumens 98 are surgical instruments 21 and camera 20. As seen in Fig. 2A, the parallel configuration of the lumens 98 hinder camera 20 in obtaining a clear view of the surgical site. It will be appreciated that the non-parallel, intersecting configuration of the lumens 108a-c of seal anchor 100 facilitate obtaining a lesser obstructed field of view than would be obtainable using seal anchor 90. In particular, as shown in Fig. 2B, axes "X" and "Z" define an angle "0" therebetween. The greater the value of angle "0", the lesser the probability of surgical instruments 21 obstructing the view of camera Moreover, the greater the angle "0", the lesser the probability of interference between instruments 21 during the procedure. In addition, the greater the angle "0", the greater the CA 02716060 2010-09-30 number of internal structures included within the surgical field and within reach of instruments 21. [0026] Proximal end 102 of seal anchor member defines a first diameter DL and distal end 104 defines a second diameter Dz. In one embodiment of seal anchor member 100, the respective first and second diameters D D2 of the proximal and distal ends 102, 104 are substantially equivalent, as seen in FIG. 1, although an embodiment of seal anchor member in which diameters D Dz are different is also within the scope of tre present disclosure. As depicted in FIG. 1, proximal and distal ends 102, 104 define substantially planar surfaces. However, embodiments are also contemplated herein in which either or both of proximal and distal ends 102, 104, respectively, define surfaces that are substantially arcuate to assist in the insertion of seal anchor member 100 within a tissue tract 12 defined by tissue surfaces 14 and formed in tissue "T", e.g., an incision, as discussed in further detail below. [0027] Intermediate portion I06 defines a radial dimension "R" and extends longitudinally between proximal and distal ends 102, 104, respectively, to define an axial dimension or length "L". The radial dimension "R" of intermediate portion 106 varies along the axial dimension, or length, "L" thereof. Accordingly, seal anchor member 100 defines a crosssectional dimension that varies along its length "L", which facilitates the anchoñng of seal anchor member 100 within tissue "T", as discussed in further detail below. However, an embodiment of seal anchor member 100 in which the radial dimension "R" remains substantially uniform along the axial dimension "L" thereof is also within the scope of the present disclosure. [0028] The radial dimension "R" of intermediate portion 106 is appreciably less than the respective diameters D1 , Dz of proximal and distal ends 102, 104 such that seal anchor member defines an "hour-glass" shape or configuration to assist in anchoring seal anchor member CA 02716060 2010-09-30 within tissue "T", as discussed in further detail below. However, in an alternate embodiment, the radial dimension "R" of intermediate portion 106 may be substantially equivalent to the respective diameters D1 , D2 of proximal and distal ends 102, 104. In cross section, intermediate portion 106 may exhibit any suitable configuration, e.g., substantially circular, oral or oblong. [0029] The seal anchor 100 may be adapted to transition from an expanded condition to a compressed condition so as to facilitate the insertion and securement thereof within tissue tract 12 in tissue "T". In the expanded condition, seal anchor 100 is at rest and the respective radial dimensions Dt, D2 of the proximal and distal ends 102, 104 of seal anchor 100, as well as the radial dimension R of the intermediate portion 106 are such that the seal anchor 100 cannot be inserted within tissue tract 12. However, the seal anchor 100 may transition to a compressed condition such that proximal and distal ends 102,104, as well as intermediate portion 106 are dimensioned for insertion into tissue tract 12. [0030] To facilitate the transition between an expanded and a compressed condition, the seal anchor 100 may be formed from a compressible material having an internal biasing force such that the seal anchor 100 will transition back to an expanded condition upon insertion of the seal anchor 100 within tissue tract 12, thereby ensuring a seal between the seal anchor 100 and the tissue tract 12. Seal anchor 100 may be formed from a shape memory material, a foam mateñal, or a gel mateñal, or the like, but may also be formed from other materials. In an embodiment, the seal anchor 100 may be formed from a material selected from the group consisting ofpolyisoprene, urethane, and silicone. [0031] Positioning members I 14, 115 of the trailing and leading ends 102, 104, respectively, may engage the walls defining the body cavity of the tissue tract 12 to facilitate CA 02716060 2010-09-30 securement of seal anchor member 100 within the body tissue. For example, positioning member 114 at leading end 104 may engage the internal peñtoneal wall and positioning member 114 adjacent trailing end 102 may engage the outer epidermal tissue adjacent the incision 12 within tissue "T". In another embodiment of seal anchor member 100, one or more additional positioning members 114 may be associated with intermediate portion 106. [0032] The use and function of seal anchor member 100 will be discussed during the course of a typical minimally invasive procedure. Initially, the peritoneal cavity (not shown) is insufflated with a suitable biocompatible gas such as, e.g., CO2 gas, such that the cavity wall is raised and lifted away from the internal organs and tissue housed therein, providing greater access thereto. The insufflation may be performed with an insufflation needle or similar device, as is conventional in the art. Either pñor or subsequent to insufflation, a tissue tract 12 is created in tissue "T", the dimensions of which may be varied dependent upon the nature of the procedure. [0033] Different embodiments of seal anchors will be described with reference to Figs. 2 and 3. Seal anchors 200, 300 are substantially similar to seal anchor 100, except in the configuration of lumens and further include structures to stabilize instrumentation inserted within the lumens. Both seal anchor 200 and seal anchor 300, shown in Figs. 2 and 3, include lumens defining intersecting axes. Seal anchor 200 includes a trailing end 202 and a distal end 204. A plurality of lumens 208 is disposed between the trailing and leading ends 202, 204. Lumens 208 define openings in the trailing end 202 that are radially positioned along the trailing end 202. A eut-out or groove 201 in the leading end extending outward from at least one lumen 208 facilitates stabilization of instrumentation inserted within the lumen 208. CA 02716060 2010-09-30 [0034] In an alternative embodiment, a seal anchor 300 including plurality of lumens disposed between leading and trailing ends 302, 304 is shown in Fig. 4. A cut-out or groove 301 in an arcuate or half-cylindrical configuration is disposed in the trailing end. At least one lumen 308 is disposed within the groove 301. Groove 301 is adapted to facilitate stabilization of instrumentation inserted within the at least one of the lumens 308 that is disposed within the area defined by the groove 301.
