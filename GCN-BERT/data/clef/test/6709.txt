This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2012-0049712 on May 10, 2012 and Korean Patent Application No. 10-2013-0052702 on May 9, 2013 with the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND ART Linear alpha-olefin is widely used in important commercial substances such as comonomers, detergents, lubricants, plasticizers or the like, and in particular, 1-hexene and 1-octene are commonly used as comonomers for controlling density of polyethylene during preparation of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE). In the conventional preparation process of LLDPE (Linear Low-Density Polyethylene), copolymerization of ethylene with alpha-olefin, for example, a comonomer such as 1-hexene and 1-octene is carried out in order to control density by forming branches in the polymer backbone. Therefore, there is a problem that the comonomer increases the production cost of LLDPE having a high content of comonomers. Many different methods have been tried to solve this problem. Further, because the application field or market size depends on the type of alpha-olefin, a technique capable of selectively producing a particular olefin is commercially important. Recently, many studies have been conducted on a chromium catalyst for preparing 1-hexene or 1-octene with a high selectivity through selective ethylene oligomerization. The conventional commercial method for 1-hexene or 1-octene preparation is the SHOP process of Shell Chemical, the Ziegler Process of Chevron Philips, or the like, which is used to produce alpha-olefins having a wide distribution range from C4˜C20 carbons. Further, many studies have been conducted to selectively prepare 1-hexene or 1-octene by ethylene trimerization or tetramerization using an organic metal catalyst (J. Am. Chem. Soc 2003, 125, 5272, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2008, 47, 5369, WO03/053890), but there is a still need for the catalysts exhibiting a sufficiently high activity. DISCLOSURE Technical Problem In order to solve the above problems of the conventional technology, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel ligand compound and chromium compound which maintain high activity and thus are used in ethylene oligomerization reaction so as to prepare low-density polyethylene in one reactor using a small amount of comonomers or using only ethylene without comonomers. Further, another object of the present invention is to provide a catalyst system including the ligand compound or the chromium compound. Technical Solution In order to achieve the above objects, the present invention provides a ligand compound represented by the following Chemical Formula 1. wherein R1, R2, R2′ and R3 are the same as or different from each other, and each independently a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbyl group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms, or a heterohydrocarbyl group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms. Further, the present invention provides a chromium compound represented by the following Chemical Formula 2. wherein R1, R2, R2′ and R3 are the same as or different from each other, and each independently a hydrogen atom, a hydrocarbyl group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms, or a heterohydrocarbyl group having 1 to 30 carbon atoms, and X is a halogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Further, the present invention provides a catalyst system including i) the ligand compound represented by Chemical Formula 1 and a chromium source, or ii) the chromium compound represented by Chemical Formula 2; and a cocatalyst. Advantageous Effects The catalyst system including the ligand compound or the chromium compound according to the present invention can be used in ethylene oligomerization to oligomerize ethylene with a high catalytic activity, compared to the known catalyst system. That is, when a polyolefin is polymerized using the catalyst system according to the present invention, highly active ethylene oligomerization reaction is possible, and therefore, it is possible to polymerize a low-density polyethylene in one reactor using only ethylene without injection of additional comonomers.
