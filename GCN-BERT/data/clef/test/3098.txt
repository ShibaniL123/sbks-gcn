FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to lorcaserin hydrochloride, processes of preparing lorcaserin hydrochloride, mixtures comprising lorcaserin hydrochloride and at least one pharmaceutical excipient and pharmaceutical compositions and therapeutic uses thereof. In particular, the present invention relates to lorcaserin hydrochloride in amorphous form. This invention also relates to cocrystals comprising lorcaserin, processes of preparing thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions and therapeutic uses thereof. In particular, the present invention relates to a cocrystal comprising lorcaserin and urea and a cocrystal compising lorcaserin and mandelic acid. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Lorcaserin (compound I) is the international commonly accepted non-proprietary name (INN) for (R)-8-chloro-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine, and has an empirical formula of CnH14NCl and a molecular weight of 195.69. The hydrochloride salt of lorcaserin is known to be therapeutically useful and is commercially marketed as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obese), or 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes). In the United States, lorcaserin hydrochloride (as hemihydrate) is marketed under the name Belviq™. The hydrochloride salt of lorcaserin was first described in U.S. Patent No. 8,367,657. Concretely, Example 14 of this patent discloses the stirring of the free base of lorcaserin with hydrochloric acid in a mixture of dichloromethane and ether, at room temperature, followed by evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure to give a white solid which corresponds to the hydrochloric acid salt of lorcaserin. U.S. Patent No. 8,168,624 is related to crystalline forms of the hydrochloride salt of lorcaserin. Example 1 of this patent is identical to Example 14 of U.S. Patent No. 8,367,657. Additionally, the patent discloses two anhydrous forms of lorcaserin hydrochloride, i.e. Form I and Form II, and a hemihydrate form (Form III). The patent also discloses that anhydrous forms I and II are hygroscopic forms, both of which readily convert to the hemihydrate (Form III) upon exposure to moisture. Moreover, Example 6 of this patent discloses that the hemihydrate (Form III) partially converts into anhydrous Form I after heating at 60 °C for one day, or at 80 °C for 30 minutes. Patent application WO 2011/153206 A1 discloses additional crystalline forms of the hydrochloride salt of lorcaserin. Based on their X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) plots, Form II as disclosed in patent application WO 2011/153206 A1 is equivalent to Form I of U.S. Patent No. 8,168,624, and Form III (hemihydrate) as disclosed in patent application WO 2011/153206 A1 is also equivalent to Form III of U.S. Patent No. 8,168,624. The dynamic moisture sorption (DMS) plot of anhydrous forms I and IV as disclosed in figures 3 and 14, respectively, of patent application WO 2011/153206 A1 are substantially similar to the DMS plot of Form II as disclosed in Figure 7 of the same patent application, thus indicating substantial adsorption of moisture at relative humidity values above about 50% for all three anhydrous forms. Consequently, both anhydrous forms I and IV as disclosed in patent application WO 2011/153206 A1 are hygroscopic forms which readily convert to the hemihydrate (Form III) upon exposure to moisture, similarly to anhydrous Form II as disclosed in patent application WO 2011/153206 A1 which is equivalent to Form I of U.S. Patent No. 8,168,624. Additionally, Example 6 of patent application WO 2011/153206 A1 discloses that anhydrous forms I and II are monotropically related and, consequently, transformation of one of these forms into the other one is expected when heating above or cooling below their corresponding transition temperature, which is between 44 and 50 °C based on Figure 17 of the same patent application. Similarly, anhydrous forms II and IV are also monotropically related and, consequently, transformation of one of these forms into the other one is expected when heating above or cooling below their corresponding transition temperature, which is between 80 and 90 °C based on Figure 17 of the same patent application. Example 1 of patent application WO 2012/030927 A2 discloses a modified-release tablet comprising Form III (hemihydrate) of lorcaserin hydrochloride. In view of the foregoing, there is an unmet need for forms of lorcaserin hydrochloride having an enhanced physical stability, and for pharmaceutical compositions comprising these forms of lorcaserin hydrochloride having an enhanced physical stability.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to lorcaserin hydrochloride in amorphous form, to mixtures comprising thereof, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising thereof, to processes for the preparation thereof, and to the use thereof for preparing a medicament for chronic disease treatment. In particular, the invention relates to lorcaserin hydrochloride in amorphous form, to mixtures comprising lorcaserin hydrochloride in amorphous form, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising lorcaserin hydrochloride in amorphous form, and to processes for the preparation of mixtures comprising lorcaserin hydrochloride in amorphous form. This invention also relates to cocrystals comprising lorcaserin, processes of preparing thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions and therapeutic uses thereof. In particular, the present invention relates to a cocrystal comprising lorcaserin and urea and a cocrystal compising lorcaserin and mandelic acid. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION There is now provided by the present invention lorcaserin hydrochloride with improved properties. In one aspect, the lorcaserin hydrochloride of the present invention can be characterized and distinguished from the prior art by reference to its physical form. Particularly, the lorcaserin hydrochloride of the present invention is in amorphous form. An amorphous material is a non-crystalline solid that lacks the long-range order characteristic of a crystal. While a crystal is composed of periodically arranged atoms in a three dimensional space, amorphous materials do not possess that periodicity and atoms are randomly distributed. This lack of three-dimensional periodicity is reflected in the materials' inability to diffract X-rays constructively; as such analysis of an amorphous sample by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) gives rise to a diffuse profile devoid of the characteristic peaks observed for crystalline phases. Since X-rays become scattered in many directions, a large bump distributed in a wide range of angles (2-theta) is obtained as a result of the XRPD analysis. In a preferred embodiment, the amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride of the present invention is characterized by having an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern showing no detectable peaks in the range from 2 to 50° (2θ or 2-theta). As used in the present invention, the term "detectable peak" denotes that the peak in the diffraction plot has a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio equal or higher than 3.0. Signal-to-noise ratio of a peak is a dimensionless parameter that is calculated by dividing the height of the peak by the baseline width of the diffraction plot, both expressed using the same length units (e.g. mm). The height of a peak is calculated by measuring the distance between peak's maximum and the baseline of the peak. Peak's maximum 2-theta values are identified by having a first-derivative value equal to zero, and a negative second-derivative value. The baseline of the peak is obtained by tracing a straight line which is tangent to the diffraction plot at the closest 2-theta value which is lower than peak's maximum 2-theta value and has both first- and second-derivative values equal to zero, and also tangent to the diffraction plot at the closest 2-theta value which is higher than peak's maximum 2-theta value and has both first- and second-derivative values equal to zero. The height of the peak is obtained by tracing a second straight line which is parallel to the previously obtained baseline of the peak and tangent to the diffraction plot at the peak's maximum 2-theta value, and measuring the distance (perpendicularly to the X-axis of the diffraction plot) between both parallel lines. On the other hand, the baseline width of the diffraction plot is calculated by tracing two parallel lines to the X-axis of the diffraction plot, the first line being tangent to the diffraction plot at its maximum value in the range between 45 and 50° (2-theta), and the second line being tangent to the diffraction plot at its minimum value in the same range between 45 and 50° (2-theta), and measuring the perpendicular distance between both parallel lines. In a preferred embodiment, the amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride of the present invention is characterized by having an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern showing no peaks with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio equal or higher than 3.0 in the range from 2 to 50° (2-theta). Crystalline forms of lorcaserin hydrochloride are characterized in the prior art with respect to their characteristic peaks in the X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern. Precisely, U.S. Patent No. 8,168,624 describes that crystalline Form I of lorcaserin hydrochloride is characterized by having characteristic peaks at 6.5, 9.6 and 10.2° ± 0.2° (2-theta), crystalline Form II of lorcaserin hydrochloride is characterized by having a characteristic peak at 11.4° ± 0.2° (2-theta), and crystalline Form III of lorcaserin hydrochloride is characterized by having characteristic peaks at 13.7° and 14.9° ± 0.2° (2-theta). Additionally, patent application WO 2011/153206 A1 describes that crystalline Form I of lorcaserin hydrochloride is characterized by having characteristic peaks at 11.5, 22.4, 22.9, 23.0, 23.3, 23.6, 23.9, 25.5, 27.6, 27.7, 28.0 and 29.8° ± 0.2° (2-theta), crystalline Form II of lorcaserin hydrochloride is characterized by having characteristic peaks at 12.9, 19.5, 19.8, 21.3, 21.6, 24.8 and 25.9° ± 0.2° (2-theta), and crystalline Form IV of lorcaserin hydrochloride is characterized by having characteristic peaks at 15.3 and 20.2° ± 0.2° (2-theta). A selection of the most characteristic peaks of the different crystalline forms of lorcaserin hydrochloride can also be obtained from their corresponding XRPD patterns, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 8,168,624 and WO 2011/153206 A1. Table 1 below summarizes the most characteristic peaks of the different crystalline forms of lorcaserin hydrochloride as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 8,168,624 and WO 2011/153206 A1.

In a further preferred embodiment, the amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride of the present invention is characterized by having an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern showing no detectable peaks at 11.4, 11.5, 12.9, 13.7, 14.9, 15.3, 20.2 or 21.6° ± 0.2° (2-theta). Precisely, the amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride of the present invention is characterized by having an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern showing no peaks with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio equal or higher than 3.0 at 11.4, 11.5, 12.9, 13.7, 14.9, 15.3, 20.2 or 21.6° ± 0.2° (2-theta). The present invention further provides a mixture comprising the amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride as hereinbefore described, together with at least one pharmaceutical excipient. In a preferred embodiment, the mixture of the present invention is characterized by having an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern showing no detectable peaks in the range from 2 to 50° (2θ or 2-theta). Precisely, the mixture of the present invention is characterized by having an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern showing no peaks with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio equal or higher than 3.0 in the range from 2 to 50° (2-theta). In a further preferred embodiment, the mixture of the present invention is characterized by having an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern showing no detectable peaks at 11.4, 11.5, 12.9, 13.7, 14.9, 15.3, 20.2 or 21.6° ± 0.2° (2-theta). Precisely, the amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride of the present invention is characterized by having an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern showing no peaks with a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio equal or higher than 3.0 at 11.4, 11.5, 12.9, 13.7, 14.9, 15.3, 20.2 or 21.6° ± 0.2° (2-theta). In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical excipient is selected from the group comprising polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, poly(vinyl caprolactam), polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene oxide, a synthetic cellulose derivative, an aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer, silica, and mixtures thereof. In a further preferred embodiment, the synthetic cellulose derivative is selected from the group comprising ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and mixtures thereof, and preferably comprises hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose. In a preferred embodiment, the mixture as hereinbefore described is characterized by having a concentration of amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride in the range from 0.1 % to 60% (w/w), preferably from 1% to 50% (w/w), more preferably from 2% to 40% (w/w), and even more preferably from 5% to 30% (w/w). The amorphous phase can be thought of as a frozen or supercooled liquid, but with the thermal fluctuations present in a liquid frozen to a greater or lesser extent, leaving only largely static structural disorder. One consequence of a disordered structure is that amorphous phases are thermodynamically unstable and, therefore, they are the most energetic forms of a compound. The tendency of amorphous phases is thus to revert to a more stable, crystalline form. The inherent physical and chemical instability associated with amorphous phases renders them less desirable. The main issues surrounding instability arise from spontaneous crystallization upon storage of the drug, crystallization or chemical instability in formulations, and secondary processing (see M. Gibson, "Pharmaceutical Preformulation and Formulation", 2nd edition, Informa Healthcare, page 62). In this sense, the author of the present invention has surprisingly found that the amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride of the present invention shows an improved physical stability when compared with the crystalline forms of lorcaserin hydrochloride. Particularly, the amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride of the present invention does not show any polymorphic transformation (i.e. crystallization) or chemical degradation when heated up to a temperature of 50 °C, even under vacuum and in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide, while crystalline Form III (hemihydrate) as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 8,168,624 and patent application WO 2011/153206 A1 is known to partially convert into anhydrous Form I after heating. Drying steps are usually included in the final manufacturing steps of both active pharmaceutical ingredients and final dosage forms, in order to remove residual solvents from the manufacturing process. Polymorphic forms typically differ in their physical properties such as, for example, melting point, solubility, and chemical reactivity. Particularly, the characteristics of the respective polymorphic forms can appreciably influence the solubility profile of a chemical substance. Further, the particular characteristics of the respective polymorphic forms can appreciably influence pharmaceutical properties such as dissolution rate and bioavailability. Consequently, polymorphic transformations during the manufacturing process are not desired. On the other hand, the amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride of the present invention does not show any polymorphic transformation (i.e. crystallization) or chemical degradation when stored under air atmosphere at 40 °C and 75% relative humidity, while the anhydrous crystalline forms of lorcaserin hydrochloride (i.e. anhydrous Form I as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 8,168,624, which is equivalent to anhydrous Form II as disclosed in WO 2011/153206 A1; anhydrous Form II as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 8,168,624; anhydrous Form I as disclosed in WO 2011/153206 A1; and anhydrous Form IV as disclosed in WO 2011/153206 A1) are known to readily convert to the hemihydrate (Form III) form upon exposure to air moisture. Contact with air moisture is likely to happen during the manipulation and storage of active pharmaceutical ingredients and final dosage forms under normal conditions. Since the particular characteristics of the respective polymorphic forms can appreciably influence pharmaceutical properties such as dissolution rate and bioavailability, polymorphic transformations during the manufacturing process or the storage are not desired. Despite its inherent stability issues, amorphous phases are usually investigated if the crystalline forms of the active pharmaceutical ingredient are low soluble in aqueous media, since the predicted solubility of amorphous phases is usually between 4 to 25 times higher than the solubility of the crystalline phases. However, crystalline lorcaserin hydrochloride hemihydrate is a highly soluble and highly permeable (BCS Class 1) compound, with solubility in water greater than 400 mg/mL, and consequently the skilled person would not be motivated to obtain amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride. Similarly, the author of the present invention has surprisingly found that the mixture comprising amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride of the present invention does not show any polymorphic transformation (i.e. crystallization) or chemical degradation when heated up to a temperature of 50 °C, even under vacuum and in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide, and that the mixture comprising amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride of the present invention does not show any polymorphic transformation (i.e. crystallization) or chemical degradation when stored under air atmosphere at 40 °C and 75% relative humidity. Similarly, the author of the present invention has surprisingly found that a pharmaceutical composition comprising amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride of the present invention does not show any polymorphic transformation (i.e. crystallization) or chemical degradation when heated up to a temperature of 50 °C, even under vacuum and in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide, and that the mixture comprising amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride of the present invention does not show any polymorphic transformation (i.e. crystallization) or chemical degradation when stored under air atmosphere at 40 °C and 75% relative humidity. The present invention further provides a process for the preparation of the mixture comprising amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride as hereinbefore described, the process comprising: (a) contacting lorcaserin hydrochloride with at least one pharmaceutical excipient, in the presence of a suitable solvent; and(b) removing the solvent.

In a further preferred embodiment, the synthetic cellulose derivative is selected from the group comprising ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and mixtures thereof, and preferably comprises hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose. In a preferred embodiment, the solvent is selected from the group comprising acetic acid, acetone, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, ethanol, formic acid, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-1-propanol, 1-pentanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, water, and mixtures thereof, and preferably comprises water. In a preferred embodiment, the step of removing the solvent comprises evaporation, spray drying or lyophilization, and preferably comprises spray drying. The present invention further provides a process for the preparation of the mixture comprising amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride as hereinbefore described, the process comprising: (a) contacting lorcaserin hydrochloride with at least one pharmaceutical excipient; and(b) mechanically comminuting the resulting mixture. In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical excipient is selected from the group comprising polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, poly(vinyl caprolactam), polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene oxide, a synthetic cellulose derivative, an aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer, silica, and mixtures thereof, and preferably comprises silica. In a further preferred embodiment, the synthetic cellulose derivative is selected from the group comprising ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and mixtures thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the step of mechanically comminuting comprises milling or extruding, and preferably comprises milling. The present invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising the mixture of lorcaserin hydrochloride in amorphous form with at least one pharmaceutical excipient and optionally, one or more pharmaceutical excipients. The present invention further provides the use of the amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride as hereinbefore described in the manufacture of a medicament for chronic weight management. Particularly, the present invention provides the use of the amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride as hereinbefore described in the manufacture of a medicament to be used as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obese), or 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes). The present invention further provides the use of the mixture comprising amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride and at least one pharmaceutical excipient as hereinbefore described in the manufacture of a medicament for chronic weight management. Particularly, the present invention provides the use of the mixture comprising amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride as hereinbefore described in the manufacture of a medicament to be used as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obese), or 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes). The present invention further provides the use of the pharmaceutical composition comprising amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride as hereinbefore described in the manufacture of a medicament for chronic weight management. Particularly, the present invention provides the use of the pharmaceutical composition comprising amorphous lorcaserin hydrochloride as hereinbefore described in the manufacture of a medicament to be used as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater (obese), or 27 kg/m2 or greater (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight related comorbid condition (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes). The term "about" when used in the present invention preceding a number and referred to it, is meant to designate any value which lies within the range defined by the number ±10% of its value, preferably a range defined by the number ±5%, more preferably a range defined by the number ±2%, still more preferably a range defined by the number ±1%. For example, "about 10" should be construed as meaning within the range of 9 to 11, preferably within the range of 9.5 to 10.5, more preferably within the range of 9.8 to 10.2, and still more preferably within the range of 9.9 to 10.1. There is also provided by the present invention a cocrystal comprising lorcaserin and urea with improved properties, in particular regarding its handling and for the formulation of pharmaceutical compositions. In another aspect, the present invention provides a cocrystal comprising lorcaserin and urea. A cocrystal is a crystalline entity in which more than one molecular substance is incorporated into the unit cell, and where at least two of these molecular substances are solid components (i.e., solid compounds in their pure forms at room temperature and pressure), and are held together by a weak interaction. Weak interaction is defined as an interaction which is neither ionic nor covalent and includes, for example, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions, and π-π interactions. In the particular case of cocrystals comprising a pharmaceutical active ingredient, the solid components that are held to the active ingredient by a weak interaction are also known as coformers. Therefore, the definition of cocrystal excludes traditional solvates, which are associations of substrates with solvents from which they are crystallized, since in this case the substrate is held by a weak interaction only to a molecule which is not a solid compound in their pure form at ambient conditions. However, in addition to the at least two solid components, cocrystals may also include solvent molecules in the crystalline lattice. Similarly, the definition of cocrystal also excludes traditional salts, which are distinguished by having all their solid components held by proton transfer, giving electrostatic linkage between oppositely-charged ions. However, a cocrystal may also have some of their components held by proton transfer, provided that at least another solid component is held by a weak interaction. Urea (diaminomethanal) is a solid compound at room temperature (melting point 133-135 °C). It is a practically non-ionizable compound, highly soluble in water and practically non-toxic since it plays an important role in the metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds by animals. In a preferred embodiment, the cocrystal comprising lorcaserin and urea of the present invention is characterized by having a molar ratio of lorcaserin to urea comprised between 0.8 and 1.2, preferably between 0.9 and 1.1. In a further preferred embodiment, the cocrystal comprising lorcaserin and urea of the present invention is characterized by having a molar ratio of lorcaserin to urea of 1.0. As used in the present invention, the molar ratio of lorcaserin to urea is calculated as the number of molecules of lorcaserin within the unit cell of the cocrystal, divided by the number of molecules of urea within the same unit cell of the cocrystal. It can be estimated by quantifying the amount of lorcaserin and the amount of urea that is contained in a certain amount of cocrystal, for example by using a suitable HPLC quantification method. In a preferred embodiment, the cocrystal comprising lorcaserin and urea of the present invention further comprises hydrogen chloride. In a further preferred embodiment, the cocrystal of the present invention comprises lorcaserin in form of lorcaserin hydrochloride, so that the secondary amine moiety of lorcaserin is in protonated form and there is also a chloride anion within the crystalline structure of the cocrystal.

In a further preferred embodiment, the molar ratio of solvent to lorcaserin within the unit cell is comprised between 0.1 and 10. As used in the present invention, the molar ratio of solvent to lorcaserin is calculated as the number of molecules of solvent within the unit cell of the cocrystal, divided by the number of molecules of lorcaserin within the same unit cell of the cocrystal. In a preferred embodiment, the cocrystal comprising lorcaserin and urea of the present invention is characterized by having an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern comprising peaks at 13.4, 16.3 and 23.3° ± 0.2° 2-theta (2θ), preferably comprising peaks at 19.7, 21.5, 24.4, 24.7 and 33.0° ± 0.2° 2-theta (2θ), and more preferably comprising peaks at 8.2, 11.4, 13.4, 15.6, 16.3, 17.2, 19.7, 21.5, 21.9, 22.4, 23.1, 23.3, 24.0, 24.4, 24.7, 25.5, 25.7, 27.1, 28.3, 29.2, 30.0, 30.8, 31.1 and 33.0° ± 0.2° 2-theta (2θ). In a further preferred embodiment, the cocrystal comprising lorcaserin and urea of the present invention is characterized by having an X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern substantially equivalent to the diffraction plot depicted in Figure 1.
