Technical Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a mop device handle connector comprising a holding plate fixing device for fixing the handle connector to a wiping cloth holding plate, a handle mounting device for connecting the handle connector to a handle, and at least a first hinge arrangement arranged for making the handle mounting device turnable in at least a first direction in relation to the holding plate fixing device. Background of the Invention Household cleaning often involves using a mop device for wiping a floor. A mop device may typically comprise a wiping cloth holding plate which is arranged for holding a wiping cloth. A handle is connected to the wiping cloth holding plate. The wiping cloth is typically made of a textile material and is attachable to that side of the holding plate which is intended for facing a floor surface. During the cleaning of a floor surface a person performing the cleaning grips the handle and causes the wiping cloth, which is located on the underside of the holding plate, to move over the floor surface to remove dirt and impurities therefrom. EP 1 653 840 B1 discloses a mop device for cleaning floors. A handle is connected to a wiper support by means of a handle connector in an articulated manner, so that a person using the mop device can move the wiper support over a floor relatively freely and still keep the wiping cloth flat against the floor. Summary of the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide a mop device handle connector which is more efficient for connecting a wiping cloth holding plate to a handle compared to those of the prior art. This and other objects are achieved by means of a mop device handle connector comprising: a holding plate fixing device for fixing the handle connector to a wiping cloth holding plate, a handle mounting device for connecting the handle connector to a handle, and at least a first hinge arrangement arranged for making the handle mounting device turnable in at least a first direction in relation to the holding plate fixing device, wherein the first hinge arrangement comprises at least one joint comprising a bending area adapted to be bent when the handle mounting device is turned in the first direction in relation to the holding plate fixing device. An advantage of this mop device handle connector is that it provides for a very efficient turnability, since the bending area provides for a hinge function that requires no extra parts. The joint of this type, sometimes referred to as a living hinge, is stable and efficient to manufacture. According to one embodiment the handle connector comprises a second hinge arrangement arranged for making the handle mounting device turnable in a second direction in relation to the holding plate fixing device, wherein said second direction is perpendicular to the first direction, the second hinge arrangement comprising at least one joint comprising a bending area adapted to be bent when the handle mounting device is turned in the second direction in relation to the holding plate fixing device. An advantage of this embodiment is that the handle mounting device, and a handle mounted to it, can be moved with much larger flexibility, when it can be moved in two perpendicular directions. Furthermore, as also the second hinge arrangement comprises a bending area, i.e. a living hinge, the second hinge arrangement is also efficient and requires few pieces. According to one embodiment the first hinge arrangement is located adjacent to the holding plate fixing device and the second hinge arrangement is located adjacent to the handle mounting device, wherein a central portion of the handle connector connects the first hinge arrangement to the second hinge arrangement. An advantage of this embodiment is that the handle connector becomes efficient to manufacture and requires few pieces for obtaining many possibilities of turning. According to one embodiment the first hinge arrangement is mounted adjacent to the holding plate fixing device and is adapted to make the handle mounting device turnable in the first direction in relation to the holding plate fixing device, the first direction being adapted to be parallel to a width of a holding plate to which the handle connector is mounted. The holding plate has, as seen from above, a generally elongated shape, and has a length which is longer than its width. Typically the length LP of the holding plate is 2 to 7 times its width WP. The elongated shape holding plate could be of various shapes including, for example, rectangular shapes, convex shapes, concave shapes, oval shapes, and triangular shapes. To provide turnability in a direction parallel to the width of the holding plate is beneficial to making the cleaning operation efficient, and makes it easy to keep the holding plate horizontal to the floor when cleaning. According to one embodiment the first hinge arrangement is located adjacent to the holding plate fixing device and comprises at least a first joint and a second joint that are parallel with each other and are arranged at a distance from each other. An advantage of this embodiment is that a very steady mounting of the handle connector to the holding plate is obtained, still with a limited use of material for the handle connector. According to one embodiment the shortest distance DLJ between the first and second joints is 10 - 50 mm. This distance provides for stability and low material consumption. Preferably, each of the at least a first and a second joint has a length LLJ, as seen in parallel to a bending axis of the joint, of 5 to 50 mm. This provides for a mechanically stable first hinge arrangement. According to one embodiment the handle connector is an integral piece made from a plastic material. An advantage of this embodiment is that the handle connector becomes relatively cheap, light and also resistant to water which is important in cleaning applications. Furthermore, manufacturing all components of the handle connector, including the at least one joint comprising a bending area, in one single integral piece provides for low cost manufacturing with a minimum of manual work involved. Plastic materials are suitable for manufacturing bending areas used in this type of joints, i.e. used in living hinges. Preferably the plastic material comprises polyethylene or polypropylene, or a co-polymer thereof. Polyethylene and polypropylene have very good fatigue resistance in applications of bending areas, i.e. in living hinges. According to one embodiment the handle connector is manufactured by injection moulding. An advantage of this embodiment is that a multitude of handle connectors can be manufactured quickly and efficiently. According to one embodiment the handle connector is integrally formed with a wiping cloth holding plate. An advantage of this embodiment is that manufacturing becomes very efficient when the handle connector and the wiping cloth holding plate are manufactured as a single integral piece. Preferably the handle connector is integrally formed with a wiping cloth holding plate by injection moulding. This provides for very efficient manufacturing. According to one embodiment, a handle mounting device of the handle connector is integral with the handle. For example, the handle mounting device and the handle could be formed in one common injection moulding process. An advantage of this embodiment is that even fewer pieces are required for the mop device. According to one embodiment, the handle, the handle connector, and the wiping cloth holding plate are all formed as a single integral piece. This provides for very efficient manufacturing and very few pieces. For example this single integral piece could be formed by injection moulding of a plastic material. According to one embodiment the at least one joint has a length, as seen in parallel to a bending axis of the joint, of 5 - 80 mm. An advantage of this embodiment is that this range of lengths of joints provides for stable and durable properties of the at least one joint. According to one embodiment, the second hinge arrangement is located adjacent to the handle mounting device and comprises a joint having a length LUJ, as seen in parallel to a bending axis of the joint, of 10-30 mm, more preferably 15-25 mm. An advantage of this embodiment is that good strength is obtained, while the joint still provides for movability of the second hinge arrangement. According to one embodiment the bending area of the at least one joint has a thickness TUJ, at its most narrow position, of 0.1 to 5 mm, more preferably 0.1 to 2 mm, and most preferably 0.15 to 1 mm. An advantage of this embodiment is that it provides for durable bending properties and good fatigue wear resistance of the joint. According to one embodiment the bending area of the at least one joint has a height HUJ of 0.2 to 10 mm. An advantage of this embodiment is that the bending area provides low resistance to being bent, which increases the fatigue resistance. According to one embodiment at least a portion of at least one face of the bending area has a radius RUJ of 0.3 to 3 mm. An advantage of this embodiment is that the bending area obtains an improved resistance to fatigue wear when provided with such a radius. More preferably, at least a portion of each of the opposing faces of the bending area is provided with the above mentioned radius. This embodiment provides for further improved resistance to fatigue wear. According to one embodiment, at least one face of the bending area has the shape of a concave lens when seen in cross-section. An advantage of this embodiment is that the concave lens shape provides for good resistance to fatigue wear of the bending area. According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a mop device comprising a handle and a wiping cloth holding plate, wherein the mop device further comprises a mop device handle connector according to any one of the above mentioned embodiments for mounting the handle to the wiping cloth holding plate. An advantage of this mop device is that it is cheap and efficient to manufacture, comprises few parts, can be sold at a low price, and is still a durable design. Further objects and features of the present invention will be apparent from the following detailed description and claims. Brief description of the Drawings The invention is described in more detail below with reference to the appended drawings in which: Fig. 1 a is a perspective view of a mop device.Fig. 1b is an enlarged perspective view and shows a mop device handle connector of the mop device shown in Fig. 1 a.Fig. 2 is an enlarged side view and shows the handle connector of Fig. 1b as seen from a first side thereof.Fig. 3 is an enlarged side view and shows the handle connector as seen in the direction of arrow III of Fig. 2.Fig. 4 is an enlarged side view of the area IV of Fig. 2 and shows a portion of a hinge arrangement. Description of Preferred Embodiments Fig. 1 a illustrates a mop device 1. The mop device 1 comprises a wiping cloth holding plate 2 which is adapted for attachment of a wiping cloth, not shown. A handle 4, of which only a portion is shown in Fig. 1a, is arranged for guiding the wiping cloth holding plate 2 with a wiping cloth attached thereon over a floor surface that is to be wiped. A handle connector 6 is fitted to the holding plate 2 for connecting, preferably in a releasable manner, the holding plate 2 to the handle 4. In the embodiment of Fig. 1 a the handle connector 6 is an integral part of the holding plate 2. For example, the handle connector 6 and the holding plate 2 may be integrally formed by extrusion moulding of a plastic material, such as polypropylene. The handle connector 6 provides for possibilities of moving the handle 4 in relation to the holding plate 2. The illustration of Fig. 1a illustrates an occasion when the handle 4 has been turned slightly backwards and to the left in relation to the holding plate 2. The holding plate 2 typically has an elongated shape which in this embodiment is a close to rectangular shape, as seen from above, with a length LP that is typically 2 to 7 times its width WP. The thickness TP of the holding plate 2 is typically less than 30 % of its width WP. Fig. 1b shows the area of the handle connector 6 of the mop device 1 in an enlarged view. The handle connector 6 has a first, lower hinge arrangement 8, and a second, upper, hinge arrangement 10. The first, lower, hinge arrangement 8 makes it possible for the handle 4 to be turned back and forth in a first direction being parallel to the width WP of the holding plate 2, as shown by an arrow BF. The second, upper hinge arrangement 10 makes it possible for the handle 4 to be turned sideways in a second direction being parallel to the length LP of the holding plate 2, as shown by an arrow SW. Hence, the first, lower, hinge arrangement 8 provides for turning the handle 4 in a first direction BF which is perpendicular to that direction SW in which the second, upper hinge arrangement 10 provides turnability. Together the two hinge arrangements 8, 10 make it possible for the handle 4 to move in almost any direction in relation to the holding plate 2. Each of the first and second hinge arrangements 8, 10 may comprise one or more individual joints. Typically, each hinge arrangement 8, 10 would comprise 1 to 4 individual joints. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1b, the first, lower, hinge arrangement 8 comprises two individual joints, namely a first lower joint 12 and a second lower joint 14. The two joints 12 and 14 are parallel with each other. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1b, the second, upper, hinge arrangement 10 comprises a single upper joint 16. The handle 4 is, in this embodiment, a generally circular tube, for example a tube made from aluminium. The handle 4 is, at a lower portion thereof, provided with at least one opening 18 which is adapted to co-operate with a corresponding knob 20 of the handle connector 6. Fig. 2 illustrates the handle connector 6 in more detail. The main parts of the handle connector 6 are the first, lower, hinge arrangement 8, comprising the first lower joint 12 and the second lower joint 14, and the second, upper hinge arrangement 10 comprising the single upper joint 16. Each respective lower joint 12, 14 is fixed to the holding plate 2 by means of a wiping cloth holding plate fixing device 21 comprising, in this embodiment, a respective first and second foot 22, 24. A central portion 26, having, in this embodiment, the general shape of a triangle as seen in this perspective, connects the lower joints 12, 14 of the lower hinge arrangement 8 to the upper joint 16 of the upper hinge arrangement 10. As can be seen from Fig. 2, the lower joints 12, 14 are parallel to each other and are arranged at an angle of 90° to the upper joint 16. The handle connector 6 comprises a handle mounting device 28 which is arranged for connecting the handle connector 6 to the handle 4, shown in Fig. 1 a. To this end, the handle mounting device 28 comprises the knob 20 which is connected to a spring element 30 that is arranged for snapping the knob 20 into the opening 18 of the handle 4 as shown hereinbefore with reference to Fig. 1 b. A connector portion 32 connects the handle mounting device 28 to the upper hinge arrangement 10 and its upper joint 16. The handle mounting device 28 may be turned relative to the holding plate 2 in the direction of the arrow SW by bending the upper joint 16 of the second, upper hinge arrangement 10. The entire handle connector 6, including the hinge arrangements 8, 10 with their respective joints 12, 14, 16, the feet 22, 24, the central portion 26, the mounting device 28 and the connector portion 32 may be made as one integral object made by, for example, injection moulding of a plastic material, such as polypropylene. In the embodiment shown, the handle connector 6 is also integral with the holding plate 2, meaning that the handle connector 6 and the holding plate 2 are injection moulded together as one integral object. Each of the lower joints 12, 14 has a length LLJ, as seen along a bending axis LBA of the joints 12, 14, which is preferably in the range of 5 to 80 mm to obtain the desired stability of the lower hinge arrangement 8. When the lower hinge arrangement 8 comprises two or more joints 12, 14, as in this embodiment, each of them more preferably have a length LLJ in the range of 5 to 50 mm. The thickness and the height of the lower joints will be described in more detail hereinafter. A shortest distance DLJ between the lower joints 12, 14 may typically be in the range of 10 - 50 mm. The total joint length may be up to a length equal to the length LP of the holding plate 2. Hence, in an alternative embodiment with only one lower joint that joint could have a length being equal to or shorter than the length LP. Fig. 3 illustrates the handle connector 6 as seen in the direction of the arrow III of Fig. 2, which means that the perspective of Fig. 3 is at an angle of 90° to the perspective of Fig. 2. The central portion 26 has, in this embodiment and when seen in this perspective, a general shape of a funnel, with its broader end pointing upwards, towards the upper joint 16 of the upper hinge arrangement 10. The upper joint 16 has a length LUJ, as seen along a bending axis UBA of the joint 16, which is preferably in the range of 5 to 80 mm, more preferably 10 to 30 mm, and most preferably 15 to 25 mm, to obtain the desired stability of the upper hinge arrangement 10. The handle mounting device 28 may be turned relative to the holding plate 2 in the direction of the arrow BF, being parallel to the width WP of the holding plate 2, by bending the lower joints 12, 14, of which only the joint 14 can be seen in the perspective of Fig. 3, of the first, lower hinge arrangement 8. Fig. 4 is an enlargement of the area IV of Fig. 2 and illustrates a central portion of the upper joint 16 in a larger scale. The lower joints 12, 14 are designed according to similar principles as the upper joint 16 and are not described separately, but are designed according to the principles described hereinafter with reference to Fig. 4. The principle of the upper joint 16 of the upper hinge arrangement 10, and also that of the joints 12, 14 of the lower hinge arrangement 8, is that of bending a material, preferably a plastic material, in an area where the material is thinner than the surrounding material and is so thin that it can be bent repeatedly back and forth many times without being broken apart. This type of joint, where a flexible joint is made from the same material as the two rigid pieces it connects, is sometimes referred to as a living hinge. Particularly suitable materials for living hinges include polypropylene and polyethylene due to their good fatigue resistance. With regard to the upper joint 16, such bending back and forth would be caused by the turning of the handle 4 sideways in the second direction SW being parallel to the length LP of the holding plate 2, as previously described with reference to Fig. 1b and as is shown by the arrow SW in Fig. 4. With regard to the lower joints 12, 14 the bending back and forth would be caused by the turning of the handle 4 in the first direction BF. The upper joint 16 has a bending area 34 at which a bending may occur without causing immediate breaking of the upper joint 16. The upper joint 16 bending area 34 preferably has a length LUJ, illustrated in Fig. 3, of 10 to 30 mm, more preferably 15 to 25 mm, to obtain the desired stability thereof. Returning to Fig. 4, the bending area 34 preferably has a height HUJ which is in the range of 0.2 to 10 mm, for example the height HUJ may be 0.35 mm. The bending area 34 must be thin to avoid being broken during repeated bending. Preferably, the bending area 34 has a thickness TUJ, at its most narrow position, which is in the range of 0.1 to 5 mm, more preferably 0.1 to 2 mm, and most preferably 0.15 to 1 mm, for example the thickness TUJ may be 0.25 mm. Preferably, at least a portion of one face 36 of the bending area 34, and preferably at least a portion of each of the opposing faces 36, 38, has a radius RUJ of 0.3 to 3 mm. This provides for efficient bending of the bending area 34 with little fatigue wear. Furthermore, the radius RUJ helps to make the bending area 34 bend along a straight line. Hence, at least one of the faces 36, 38 of the bending area 34 may preferably have the general shape of a concave lens, when seen in cross-section. In the illustration of Fig. 4, both the left and the right face 36, 38 of the bending area 34 have the shape of a concave lens. As mentioned above, the lower joints 12, 14 have bending areas 34 that are designed according to similar principles as the bending area 34 of the upper joint 16, although the length of the respective joint may be different. It will be appreciated that numerous variants of the embodiments described above are possible within the scope of the appended claims. Hereinbefore it has been described, with reference to Figs. 1 a to 1 b, an embodiment in which the handle connector 6 and the holding plate 2 are formed as an integral part by, for example, injection moulding of a plastic material. It will be appreciated that it will also be possible to form the handle connector and the holding plate as two separate parts that are subsequently mounted to each other, for example by means of a snap-action connection. Hereinbefore it has been described that the first hinge arrangement 8 may comprise two joints 12, 14. It will be appreciated that the first hinge arrangement may also comprise other numbers of joints, for example 1 to 4 joints, depending on the degree of stability that is desired. Hereinbefore it has been described that the bending area 34 may preferably have the general shape of a concave lens, as illustrated in Fig. 4. It will be appreciated that the bending area 34 may also have other shapes, including, for example, the shape of the letter "I", or having a shape with one concave surface and one flat surface, etc. Hereinbefore, it has been described that the handle mounting device 28 of the handle connector 6 is arranged for being connected to a long handle 4. It will be appreciated that also handles of other lengths could be attached to the handle mounting device 28. Hence, the length of the handle 4 could be varied in a broad range, typically within the range of 20 to 200 cm. Furthermore, the handle need not be a separate part, but could also be an integrated part of the handle mounting device 28, in which case the handle could be formed together with the handle mounting device 28 in an injection moulding process.
