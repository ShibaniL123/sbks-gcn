(Example 12) Synthesis of 3-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-1-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-3-oxopropyl acetate:
Pyridine (0.042 mL, 0.51 mmol) and acetic anhydride (0.042 mL, 0.51 mmol) were added to a solution of 1-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-3-hydroxy-3-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one (0.120 g, 0.428 mmol) in dichloromethane (2.1 mL) at 0Â°C and the reaction liquid was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Further, acetic anhydride (0.020 mL, 0.24 mmol) was added at room temperature and the reaction liquid was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour. A saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogencarbonate was added to the reaction liquid and the reaction liquid was extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with a 10% aqueous solution of sodium chloride and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (NH silica gel, chloroform/methanol) to obtain 3-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)-1-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-3-oxopropyl acetate (0.114 g, 0.353 mmol, 82%) (hereinafter referred to as the compound of Example 12) as a colorless oil.
