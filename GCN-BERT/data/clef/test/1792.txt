INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE STATEMENT [0002] All publications, patents, and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent, or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. [0003] U.S. Ser. No 13/420,520, filed March 14, 2012, now U.S. Patent No. 8,301,232, is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND [0004] Blood pressure is a key vital sign monitored by physicians, it is used for the diagnosis of many medical conditions, and by itself is monitored as a key metric for the management of disease. The standard measure of blood pressure is the auscultatory method, wherein a specialist inflates a cuff around the arm and uses a stethoscope to determine the systolic blood pressure and the diastolic blood pressure. Hypertension, an elevation in either the systolic or diastolic blood pressure, is a medical condition that afflicts some 70 million Americans, and it is estimated that only about half of these people have their disease under control. SUMMARY [0005] The presently claimed and disclosed concepts relate generally to heart monitoring devices and methods and, more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to methods, devices, systems and software for measuring blood pressure using a mobile device.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0021] Before explaining at least one embodiment of the inventive concepts disclosed herein in detail, it is to be understood that the inventive concepts are not limited in their application to the details of construction, experiments, exemplary data, and/or the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description, or illustrated in the drawings. The presently disclosed and claimed inventive concepts are capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for purpose of description only and should not be regarded as limiting in any way. [0022] In the following detailed description of embodiments of the inventive concepts, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the inventive concepts. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the inventive concepts within the disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily complicating the instant disclosure. Certain Definitions [0023] Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, "or" refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or. For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present). [0024] In addition, use of the "a" or "an" are employed to describe elements and components of the embodiments herein. This is done merely for convenience and to give a general sense of the inventive concepts. This description should be read to include one or at least one and the singular also includes the plural unless it is obvious that it is meant otherwise. [0025] Finally, as used herein, any reference to "one embodiment" or "an embodiment" means that a particular element, feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of the phrase "in one embodiment" in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. [0026] While the term "extremities" is used herein for the body area used to detect heart rate, it need not be an extremity and could be, for example, a chest or stomach location on the body. In general, using a position close to the heart and comparing to a position far from the heart will provide the longest differential and therefore increased accuracy. [0027] A "subject" as defined by this disclosure can be any human person in which blood pressure monitoring would be advantageous. The person can have a diagnosed illness, including but not limited to, primary hypertension, secondary hypertension, or gestational hypertension. The person can be considered healthy and undiagnosed with any disease. The methods of this disclosure include monitoring of both healthy persons and those diagnosed with a medical condition. Non-invasive blood pressure measurements [0028] Pressure waves produced at the heart propagate through the arteries at a certain velocity known as the pulse wave velocity (PWV). The PWV depends on the blood pressure and the elastic properties of arteries. A person's blood pressure has been shown to be proportional to, or a function of, the pressure wave velocity. The PWV is equal to the length of a vessel ( ) divided by the time it takes for a pressure pulse to arrival through a vessel. The time it takes for a pressure pulse to travel the length of the vessel ( ) is known as the pulse arrival time (PTT), or pulse arrival time (PAT). PTT and PAT are used interchangeably herein. The formula for determination of the PWV is as follows: PWV = 1/ PTT The PAT is considered to have a correlation with blood pressure, and attempts have been made to use the PAT for indirect blood pressure measurements. [0029] It was once thought that the PAT could be estimated as the time between the QRS peak on an ECG and the time the wave or pulse of blood reaches an extremity. The QRS peak could be measured using known ECG devices, and the time the pulse of blood reaches an extremity could be measured using known methods such as photoplethysmogram (PPG). The PPG method detects changes in blood volume during a cardiac cycle by illuminating the skin, and measuring changes in light absorption. PPG has become a popular method for measuring heart rate and oxygen saturation by using, for example, a mobile phone's embedded flash as a light source and the camera as a light sensor when held adjacent a peripheral site such as the finger. The PPG measurement can also be made at another peripheral site such as the ear, forehead, or chest. The PPG signal obtained consists of pulses that reflect the change in vascular blood volume with each cardiac beat. [0030] Such time measurements used for the PWV included a "pre-ejection" period, which is the time interval from the beginning of electrical stimulation of the ventricles to the actual opening of the aortic valve. The aortic valve will not open until the blood pressure within the ventricle is greater than the pressure in the aorta. Thus, present attempts to measure PWV actually use a length of artery divided by the sum of the pre-ejection period plus the time for the pulse to travel that length of artery. [0031] By making simultaneous PPG measurements at different locations of the body, the effect of the pre-ejection period can be eliminated by subtraction. PPG measurements can be made by a mobile device equipped with a camera. Key to eliminating the effect of the pre- ejection period is calculating a differential PAT, i.e. the difference between when the pulse reaches extremity A and when it reaches extremity B. This eliminates the pre ejection period, because it is the same for both extremities, and is removed by using the differential PAT (PATA- PATB). The differential PAT time can be measured, for example, by using a mobile phone having both front and back cameras, and thus perform PPG measurements simultaneously at two different locations of the body. By using the differential PAT one can calculate a PWV using the following equation: PWV = (lA -lB)/(PTTA -PTTB) If repeated measurements are made at the same body locations over time, then the length ( ) of the pulse arrival need not be determined. Since blood pressure is proportional to the PWV, and the PWV is inversely proportional to the differential PAT, blood pressure can be determined by calculating the differential PAT. If the PAT can be correlated to blood pressure by an independent method, for example, the auscultatory method or an automated oscillometric blood pressure device at home one can track changes in blood pressure, merely by tracking changes in PAT. [0032] Alternatively a differential PAT can be calculated using two successive, not simultaneous, PPG measurements, if an ECG is also employed to synchronize the PPG measurements. If successive ECG measurements and their corresponding PPG measurements are made, they can be time aligned by averaging the QRS readings from the ECGs associated with each PPG measurement, and then aligning the PPG measurements taken to the average QRS . This will result in two PATs derived from average QRS complexes. The differential PAT is the difference between these two PATs. A schematic of this process is shown in Fig. 1. In this way the effect of the pre-ejection period can be minimized. As with the previous method the differential PAT can be correlated to blood pressure by an independent method, for example, the auscultatory method or an automated oscillometric blood pressure device at home allowing one to track changes in blood pressure, merely by tracking changes in the differential PAT. [0033] By occasionally calibrating an individual's PAT to a given blood pressure as measured by, for example, the auscultatory method or an automated oscillometric device at home, one can calibrate the differential PAT with blood pressure. As a result one can utilize a mobile device throughout the day to track their blood pressure when other methods may not be convenient. In certain embodiments, the method described herein requires calibration once a day. In certain embodiments, the method described herein requires calibration every other day. In certain embodiments, the method described herein requires calibration 2, 3, 4, or 5 times a week. In certain embodiments, the method described herein requires calibration once a week. In certain embodiments, the calibration is adaptive, whereby multiple calibration events are stored and used to improve the overall accuracy of the method.

[0049] Herein are presented various non limiting practical examples of the systems, methods and devices of this disclosure. Example 1-measurment of blood pressure in an individual using dual optical sensors [0050] A non-limiting example of one embodiment of the method requires holding a mobile phone in front of one's face as shown in FIG. 6, detecting the pulse on a finger covering the camera lens on the back of the mobile phone as shown in FIG. 7, and simultaneously detecting the pulse on one's face using the camera on the front of the mobile phone, the time lag between the finger pulse and the face pulse can be calculated as the differential PAT, and eliminates the pre-ejection period and errors caused by inclusion of the pre-ejection period. The mobile phone can be held at any distance from the face that allows for proper imaging. In certain embodiments, the phone is held less than 3 feet from the face. In certain embodiments, the phone is held less than 2 feet from the face. In certain embodiments, the phone is held less than 1 foot from the face. In certain embodiments, the phone is held less than 6 inches from the face. In certain embodiments, the phone can be used to detect the pulse at a location of the body other than the face, this location can be the neck, chest, stomach or any other location suitable for detecting a pulse. In certain embodiments the methods of this disclosure can be carried out using a tablet computer. In certain embodiments the methods of this disclosure can be carried out using a smart watch. In certain embodiments the methods of this disclosure can be carried out using a device that is solely intended to monitor vital signs. [0051] In a second non- limiting embodiment of this method, a subject can hold a first finger over the forward facing camera, and a second finger over the rear-facing camera of a mobile device. PPG measurements can then be made, and the differential PAT calculated. Using the differential PAT blood pressure can be calculated in a way similar to the first embodiment. Example 2-measurment of blood pressure in an individual using a single optical sensor and an ECG [0052] Some individuals may not have a mobile device with front and back camera ability or the frames per second or resolution of the available front camera may not be sufficient to provide accurate blood pressure correlations. However, by using a mobile device enabled to take ECG measurements, such as described in U.S. Patent No. 8,301,232, it is possible to use a mobile device to measure the pulse at one extremity while simultaneously taking ECG measurements, and then measure the pulse at another extremity or position while again simultaneously taking ECG measurements. The heart rate signals are then aligned with the ECG signals to determine a time difference or differential PAT. The differential PAT, once calibrated to the individual, can be used to estimate and track blood pressure. [0053] For example, a person can place their left and right hands on the electrodes of a mobile phone back cover or protective case configured to measure and record ECG measurements, as shown in Fig. 8, while simultaneously placing a finger over the back camera lens on the mobile device. Software then calculates a PAT from the initiation of the QRS complex to the sensing of blood flow at the finger using the camera of the mobile device as a PPG. These steps can be repeated using a different location of the body such as a finger from the other hand or foot. Software downloadable to the mobile device averages the two QRS signals from the ECG, and time-aligns the two PPG measurements with the averaged ECG to calculate the differential PAT. As described above, software downloadable to the mobile phone can correlate the differential PAT to blood pressure. The correlation merely requires calibration after using a standard blood pressure measurement and consistent use of the same extremities for measuring heart rate.
