SINTERED ZIRCON MATERIAL FOR FORMING BLOCK TECHNICAL FIELD [0001] The present disclosure is generally directed to zircon refractory objects and methods of forming and using zircon refractory objects. [0002] High strain point alkali free alumino-silicate glasses, such as, glasses for ultra high resolution Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) substrates using amorphous silicon or oxide thin film transistors (TFTs), or glasses for organic light emitting diode (OLED) substrates using low temperature polysilicon (LTPS) TFT deposition have been designed to allow high temperature processing of the TFT (up to 700 °C) while not suffering from deformation. These glasses can be formed using a fusion draw process where liquid glass flows over the lips of a glass overflow forming block made of zircon (ZrSiO/t) material and fuses at the bottom of the glass overflow forming block to form a sheet. Zircon forming blocks that come in contact with alkali free alumino-boro-silicate glasses offer good corrosion resistance and mechanical properties at the forming temperature of glass. However, the forming of these higher strain point alkali free alumino-silicate glasses is more demanding on the forming blocks because of the higher forming temperature (between + 30 and 120 °C). The higher forming temperature can increase the rate of reaction between the glass and the zircon materials leading to higher formation of bubbles in the glass with current zircon materials which is not acceptable for the ultra high resolution TFT substrate applications. Secondly, the higher forming temperature activates the creep deformation rate of the zircon material leading to higher sag of the forming blocks (up to 10 times more deformation) that is not acceptable for the forming of these glasses. There's therefore a need for a new range of zircon materials with improved properties at high temperatures.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0020] The following is generally directed to a refractory object having a zircon body and a method of forming a refractory object having a zircon body. Notably, a zircon body may be defined as the body of a refractory object formed according to embodiments described herein, such that a majority of the composition of the zircon body is a zircon material (i.e., the zircon body may include a content of zircon of at least about 50 wt. for a total weight of the zircon body). The zircon body may further include an A1203 containing component and a Si02 component [0021] According to a particular embodiment, the method of forming a refractory object having a zircon body in accordance with embodiments described herein may include providing a zircon batch and the forming the zircon batch into the zircon body of the refractory object. [0022] The zircon batch may include a mixture of raw material powder used in forming the zircon body. This raw material powder may initially include an unprocessed raw material, for example, unprocessed zircon material (i.e., sand), A1203 containing material and a Si02 containing material. The unprocessed raw material may be initially processed by separating undesired components (e.g., impurities) from the unprocessed raw material. The unprocessed raw material may be processed using classifying techniques, for example, particle size separation, vibration or gravity table separation, electrostatic separation, electromagnetic separation or any combination thereof. Particle size separation allows for separation of particles within a powder based on its size, which reduces impurity content. Vibration or gravity table separation can separate particles within a powder based on density, which can reduce the amount of alumina rich silicates as well as silica grains from the raw material powder. Electrostatic separation can separate particles within a powder based on electrical conductivity, which may allow the separation of titaniferous mineral particles, ilmenite and rutile. Electromagnetic separation can separate particles within a powder based on the magnetic properties of the particles. It will be appreciated that initial processing of the unprocessed raw material may include any combination of the separation methods noted above and may include multiple applications of any of the separation methods noted above. It will be further appreciated that initial processing of the unprocessed raw material may include application of the separation methods above in sequence or in parallel. [0023] Providing the zircon batch may include combining or mixing the raw material powder and any additional materials (i.e., sintering aids, binders, other additives, etc.) by any suitable method. Mixing or batch preparation may be performed dry or wet. Mixing may include an addition step of granulation. The granulation step may be added to improve flowability of the batch and therefore increase apparent density of the green body. In one example embodiment, granulation may be performed using spray drying. The raw material powders may be mixed into a blunge tank and then spray dried. [0024] Forming the zircon batch into the zircon body may include shaping the spray dried powder or batch to form a green body having a particular shape using isostatic pressing. The spray dried powder forms a highly flowable powder that can be used to fill large isostatic molding cans to minimize filling defects, such as, non-uniform compaction of green density, voids or cracks. The raw material powder is filled into a rubber mold maintained in a solid metallic can. The bag is then sealed and a vacuum is applied to the raw material powder. The can is then submerged into a pressure vessel filled with a fluid and then pressed. After pressing, the mold is removed from the pressure vessel and the green body is removed. [0025] Shaping may occur at a particular pressure, for example, by isostatic pressing at a pressure at least about 50 MPa, such as, at least about 60 MPa, at least about 70 MPa, at least about 80 MPa, at least about 90 MPa, at least about 100 MPa, at least about 110 MPa, at least about 120 MPa, at least about 130 MPa, at least about 140 MPa or even at least about 150 MPa. The pressure may be applied step by step to the green body using an isostatic pressing cycle lasting for about 10 minutes to about 120 minutes. These pressing cycles may limit formation of defects during the pressing stage. Shaping may also be performed using alternative techniques such as slip casting or unidirectional pressing. [0026] The shape of the green body can be rectilinear, cylindrical, spherical, ellipsoidal or nearly any other shape. In a particular embodiment, the green body can be in the shape of a rectilinear block referred to as a blank that can subsequently be machined to form a glass overflow trough, a spout lip or a bushing block. In another particular embodiment, the green body may have at least one dimension larger than about 100 mm, such as, larger than about 200 mm, larger than about 300 mm, larger than about 400 mm, larger than about 500 mm, larger than about 600 mm, larger than about 700 mm or even larger than about 800 mm. In another embodiment, the green body can be structured in such a fashion to more closely match a final component, for example, a forming block, to limit post forming processes. [0027] FIG. 5 illustrates a forming block 200. The forming block 200 can include an overflow trough portion 202 and a tapered portion 204. The overflow trough portion 202 can include a trough that has a depth that decreases along a length of the forming block 200. FIG. 6 includes a cross- sectional view of exemplary shapes of the tapered portion 204. More particularly, the tapered portion can include a wedge shape 2042, a concave shape 2044, or a convex shape 2046. Other shapes may be used to meet the needs or desires for a particular application. [0028] After the green body is formed, the green body can be heated in an oven, heater, furnace, or the like to form the body that includes zircon material. The heating process can include an initial heating where moisture, a solvent, or another volatile component is evaporated, organic material is vaporized, or any combination thereof.

The green body can be sintered for a time period in a range of approximately 10 hours to approximately 100 hours to form the body.

It will be further appreciated that the cooling rate may be any value within a range between any of the maximum and minimum values noted above. [0033] The shape of the body after sintering generally corresponds to the shape of the green body prior to sintering. Thus, the body may have any of the shapes as previously described with respect to the green body. During sintering, some shrinkage may occur, and the body may be smaller than the green body. [0034] After initial processing and milling, the raw material powder in the zircon batch may include zircon grains that may have a particular median (D50) particle size. For example, the zircon grains may have a median (D50) particle size of not greater than about 15 μιη, such as, not greater than about 14 μιη, not greater than about 12 μιη, not greater than about 10 μιη, not greater than about 9, μιη, not greater than about 8 μιη, not greater than about 7 μιη, not greater than about 6 μιη, not greater than about 5 μιη, not greater than about 4 μιη, not greater than about 3 μιη or even not greater than about 2 μιη.

It will be further appreciated that the zircon grains may have a median (D50) particle size of any value within a range between any of the maximum and minimum values noted above. [0035] According to still other embodiments, the raw material powder in the zircon batch may have a particle size distribution controlled such that the zircon grains have a particular D90 particle size.

[00105] According to still other embodiment, a zircon body formed according to methods described herein may have particular creep deformation rate for a particular temperature. Creep deformation rate may be measured using an isothermal three point or four point creep test. [00106] In a three point isothermal creep test, a three point bending test configuration is used where two supports are placed under a sample and a single loading member applies force on top of the sample. The sample bar may have a height "a" of 2.5 mm, a width "b" of 3 mm and a length of 15 mm with a distance "L" between the outer supports of 12 mm. During testing, the sample bar may be placed on the two supports and loading member may apply a stress of 2 MPa at the center of the sample bar. Testing occurs in a heating chamber. The temperature of the heating chamber during testing may be maintained at a set testing temperature, such as, for example, at a temperature of 1350 °C, 1325 °C or 1300 °C for a total testing time of between 12 to 32 hours. Instantaneous displacement of the sample in millimeters (mm) may be measured during the test by measuring the displacement of the single loading member on the top surface of the sample. Sample displacement may then be used to calculate a creep deformation rate per hour (i.e., creep deformation rate) for the sample at the testing temperature under the applied stress using Hollenberg models (i.e., creep deformation rate "Rdef" is derived from the displacement rate R^p by the formula: Rdef = Rdisp * (6. a / L2) ). [00107] According to a particular embodiment, zircon bodies formed according to methods described herein may have a particular creep deformation rate as measured using a three point bending test at a temperature of 1350 °C under an applied stress of 2 MPa.

It will be appreciated that the creep deformation rate as measured using a three point bending test at a temperature of 1300 °C under an applied stress of 2 MPa may be any value or may be not greater than any value between any of the values noted above. [00110] In a four point isothermal creep test, a four point bending test configuration is used where two outer supports are placed under a sample and two inner loading members apply force on top of the sample. A distance L between the outer supports may be 80 mm and a distance 1 between the inner loading members may be 40 mm. The sample bar may have a height "a" of 8 mm, a width "b" of 9 mm and a length of 100 mm. During testing, the sample bar may be placed on the supporting members and the loading members may apply a stress of 2 MPa on the sample bar. Testing may occur in a heating chamber.

The instantaneous deflection of the sample in millimeters (mm) may be measured during the test using a LVDT in contact with the bottom surface of the sample. A reference displacement is subtracted from an instantaneous displacement to provide a particular sample displacement during the test. Sample displacement may then be used to calculate the creep deformation rate per hour (i.e., creep deformation rate). The deformation rate Rdef is derived from the particular sample displacement rate "Rdisp" by the formula: Rdef= RdisP.12.a / ( 3.L2 - (L - l) )2.

[00115] According to still another embodiment, zircon bodies formed according to methods described herein may have a particular blistering value as measured using a short term or a long term blistering test conducted using a glass called LCD A glass. LCD A glass is a commercially available alkali-free boroalumino silicate glass substrate used in the production of AMLCD displays. LCD A glass contains between 58.5 and 63.0 wt. Si02, between 15.5 and 17.0 wt. A1203, between 9 and 11 wt. B203 and between 10 and 15 wt.% of alkali-earth components (MgO, CaO and SrO). LCD A glass also includes a variety of other minor constituent, such as BaO and fining agents (i.e. Sn02), and it is essentially free of As203. The sum of all constituents being 100 wt.% . Additionally LCD A glass has a density between 2.4 and 2.5 g/cc and a strain point between 650 and 670 °C after 8 hours of exposure to a temperature of 1200 °C. [00116] In a short term plaque blistering test, a square or cylinder sample was prepared. The square sample may have a length and width or 1 inch and a thickness of ¼ in. The cylinder sample may have a diameter of 1 in and a thickness of ¼ in. A face of the sample may be ground down with a 30 micron surface finish, cleaned in an ultra sound bath and dried. A glass sheet (i.e., LCD A glass) may be placed on the surface of the sample and the sample may be heated at 5 °C per minute to a testing temperature of 1200 °C. The sample may be held at the testing temperature for 8 hours and then rapidly cooled at least 10 °C per minute to room temperature in order to avoid devitrification of the glass. The sample may then be cut in half and the cross section may be polished to 1 micron. A stereo-microscope or binocular may then be used to observe the cross-section and count the number of bubbles visible in a section of 3000 microns along the interface to a depth of 500 microns into the glass. The number of bubbles may then be divided by 1.5 provide the number of bubble per square mm at the interface between sample and the glass. [00117] In a long term crucible blistering test, a crucible is core drilled from a sample block. The crucible may have a height of 40 mm and a diameter of 50 mm, with a hole in the middle of the crucible having a height of 30 mm and a diameter of 30 mm. Once prepared, the crucible may be cleaned using DI water in an ultrasonic bath to eliminate any possible residues from machining and then dried. Once dried, the crucible may be filled with 20 g of broken pieces of glass (i.e., LCD A glass) and then heated up to the testing temperature and soaked for an extended period of time (72 hours, 120 hours, or 360 hours). After the soak is completed the crucible is cooled down to room temperature. The crucible is then cut vertically to expose the glass and blistering intensity is observed. In a long term crucible blistering test, the materials are tested at 1200°C in LCD glass A for 360 hours. A stereo-microscope or binocular may then be used to observe the cross-section and count the number of bubbles visible in a section of 3000 microns along the interface to a depth of 500 microns into the glass. The number of bubbles may then be divided by 1.5 provide the number of bubble per square mm at the interface between sample and the glass. [00118] According to particular embodiments, zircon bodies formed according to methods described herein may have a particular blistering value as measured using a short term plaque blistering test on LCD A glass.

Length L shows a distance of 500 microns into glass layer 103 from the surface of zircon material 102. FIG. 1 shows that no blistering occurred in zircon material 102 during the blistering test because no bubbles formed along the interface 101 to a depth of 500 microns into glass layer 103 from interface 101.

The blocks were then sintered at a maximum temperature of 1600 °C for 30h. [00252] The formed zircon material of Example 9 was also analyzed with a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and with wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to identify and calculate to composition of multiple A1203 rich phases in the zircon material. FIG. 3 illustrates a wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy map 300 showing the presence of A1203 rich phases 301 larger than about 1 micron in the zircon material. [00253] Table 3 summarizes the composition of three of these A1203 rich phases from Example 9. Results are normalized so that the sum of all analyzed constituents adds up to 100 wt. . TABLE 3 - Composition of A1203 rich phases in Example 9 [00254] Turning to conventional examples, multiple conventional compositions were prepared, formed into conventional component material and tested for comparison to zircon body material formed according to embodiments described herein. [00255] Table 3 summarizes the composition of the conventional mixtures, component composition of formed conventional material and measured physical characteristics of the formed convention material, including creep deformation rates measured using a 3-point bend test, creep deformation rates measured using a 4-point bend test, short term blister values and long term blister values, for conventional Examples C1-C3. TABLE 4 - Example Conventional Materials [00256] Conventional Examples CI and C2 were formed from a combination of unprocessed raw materials. The combined materials were then dry mixed and the batch mixture was pressed into a block shape in a cold isostatic press at room temperature under a pressure of lOOMPa and 180MPa. The blocks were then sintered at a maximum temperature of 1600 °C for 30h. Conventional Example C3 was formed from a combination of unprocessed raw materials. The combined materials were then spray dried and the spray dried granules were pressed into a block shape in a cold isostatic press at room temperature under a pressure of lOOMPa and 180MPa. The blocks were then sintered at a maximum temperature of 1600 °C for 30h. [00257] The formed conventional material of Example C3 was also analyzed with a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and with wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. FIG. 4 illustrates a wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy map 400 having intergranular phases 401. FIG. 4 shows that no A1203 rich phases larger than about 1 micron were formed in the conventional material of Example C3. [00258] Table 5 summarizes the composition of intergranular phases 401 from Example C3 as shown in the wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy map 400 of FIG. 4. Notably, the intergranular phases 401 showed a content of less than 10 wt. A1203. Results are normalized so that the sum of all analyzed constituents adds up to 100 wt.%. TABLE 5 - Composition of intergranular phases in Example C3 [00259] The present application represents a departure from the state of the art. Notably, the embodiments herein demonstrate improved and unexpected performance over zircon components formed according to conventional methods. While not wishing to be bound to a particular theory, it is suggested that the combination of certain contents of materials in the raw zircon material mixture and in the formed zircon body material, including for example, contents of alumina containing compositions, contents of Si02, content of sintering aids and ratios of these components to each other facilitate the formation a refractory object or component having a unique combination of features, including but not limited to, low creep deformation rates at high temperatures, low blistering values, large A1203 rich intergranular phases, free silica distribution, free silica content in the finally formed zircon component, apparent porosity of the finally formed zircon component.
