Reference Example C-8: Synthesis of [4-[6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridazin-3-yl]-2-pyridyl]methylamine hydrochloride (C-8)
(step 1) Synthesis of 3-chloro-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridazine
To 3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyridazin-6-one (1.1 g, 6.7 mmol) was added phosphorus oxychloride (10 mL) and the mixture was stirred at 100Â°C for 2.5 hr, and concentrated under reduced pressure. To the obtained residue were added dichloromethane and water, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 min. After stirring, the mixture was alkalified with potassium carbonate and partitioned. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine, dried over sodium sulfate and the desiccant was filtered off. The solvent was evaporated and the obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate) to give the title compound (0.77 g, 4.2 mmol, 63%).
