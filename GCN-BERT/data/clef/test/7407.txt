Step 6
To Compound 192 (165 mg, 0.312 mmol) in DMF (1.65 mL) solution were added cesium carbonate (254 mg, 0.779 mmol) and iodomethane (0.097 mL, 1.56 mmol), the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hours. Water (30 mL) was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (30 mL) and saturated brine (30 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After concentration, the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 193 (148 mg, 88% yield) as white foam.
