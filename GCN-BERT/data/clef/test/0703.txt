CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This patent application is the U.S. national phase of International Application No. PCT/EP2011/003091, filed Jun. 22, 2011, which claims the benefit of German Patent Application No. 10 2010 050 275.8, filed Nov. 2, 2010, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. The invention relates to glass ceramics based on the lithium metasilicate system (Li2O.SiO2(Li2SiO3)), which are mechanically processible in a simple manner in an intermediate stage of the crystallization and, after complete crystallization, represent a high-strength, highly translucent and chemically stable glass ceramic. In the lithium oxide-silicon dioxide system, lithium disilicate (Li2O.2 SiO2(Li2Si2O5))-glass ceramics are well known from the literature and several patents are based on this glass ceramic system. For example, in EP-B-536 479, self-glazed lithium disilicate glass ceramic objects are thus described for the production of tableware and, in EP-B-536 572, lithium disilicate glass ceramics which can be used by scattering a fine-particle coloured glass onto the surface thereof as cladding elements for building purposes, A main focus of the patented lithium disilicate glass ceramics resides in dental applications. The lithium disilicate system is very suitable here for the production of CAD/CAM-processible glass ceramics since the crystallization is effected here via the lithium metasilicate phase (see S. D. Stookey: “Chemical Machining of Photosensitive Glass”, Ind. Eng. Chem., 45, 115-118 (1993) and S. D. Stookey: “Photosensitively Opacifiable Glass” U.S. Pat. No. 2,684,911 (1954)). These lithium metasilicate glass ceramics have such low strengths in this intermediate stage that they can be readily processed by means of CAD/CAM (M.-P. Borom, A. M. Turkalo, R. H. Doremus: “Strength and Microstructure in Lithium Disilicate Glass Ceramics”, J. Am. Ceram. Soc., 58, No. 9-10, 385-391 (1975) and M.-P. Borom, A. M. Turkalo, R. H. Doremus: “Verfahren zum Herstellen von Glaskeramiken” (Method for the production of glass ceramics) DE-A-24 51 121 (1974)). Only by the subsequent conversion to form lithium disilicate in a second crystallization stage are dental materials with high strengths achieved. This principle is exploited in order to produce firstly a glass ceramic, in a two-stage crystallization process, which glass ceramic can be readily processed mechanically, e.g. by means of CAD/CAM processes, and in order to process this subsequently in a second crystallization stage to form dental glass ceramic. This method is suitable in order to be able to use dental restorations according to the so-called chair-side method. In this method, an individually adapted crown/onlay/inlay is milled out of a glass ceramic block after the first crystallization stage by means of CAD/CAM, in the dental practice this is subjected to the second crystallization stage in a special oven and used directly in the first and only dentist's visit for the patient (DE 10 2005 028 637). An application by the dental technician in the pressing method or in mechanical processing with subsequent characterisation or individualisation whilst taking into account suitable paints or layer ceramics can also be effected. Starting herefrom, it was the object of the present invention to provide glass ceramics which have improved strength values and also improved translucence and chemical resistance. This object is achieved by the features of the lithium silicate glasses or glass ceramics, the method for producing a dental restoration and shaped dental restoration described herein, and the advantageous developments thereof. Uses of the lithium silicate glasses or glass ceramics are also described. Within the scope of the present invention, glass compositions were developed in the basic system SiO2—Li2O—ZrO2, which have lithium metasilicate as only or as main crystal phase (>50%). %). Hereby, zirconia acts as a stabilizer of the residual glassy phase and can be completely or partially replaced by oxides of Hafnium, Germanium, Cerium, Lanthanum, Yttrium, Titanium and zinc. Surprisingly, it was shown that lithium metasilicate glass ceramics which have excellent strength values, exceptional translucence and very good chemical resistances can be produced in this system. It was shown in addition that up to 20% by weight of ZrO2 or other stabilizers can be incorporated in the glass without the structure being significantly influenced. Contrary to all expectations, the ZrO2 or other stabilizers does not hereby crystallise as a separate crystal phase but remains completely or extensively in the amorphous residual glass phase. Because of the high proportion of ZrO2 or other stabilizers, the mechanical and chemical resistances are hugely improved in this amorphous phase, which also leads to improved properties in the entire dental glass ceramic (crystal phase(s) and residual glass phase), such as for example final strength and acid solubility. The method is also suitable for a two-stage production process from the initial glass, a partial crystallization of the lithium metasilicate being effected in the first processing stage, which enables good CAD/CAM processing. In the second processing stage, an increase in the crystal phase proportion (primary lithium metasilicate) is effected, which leads to the high strength values. The most important cause of the surprisingly high strengths in the lithium metasilicate system is hereby ascribed to the high zirconium oxide or other stabilizers proportion (>8 MA). High translucence is ensured via the low crystallite size in the glass ceramics. In addition, good chemical stability is ensured by the high zirconium oxide proportion in the glass phase and the enriched amount of SiO2 in the residual glassy phase compared to lithiumdisilicate-glass-ceramics (Lithiumdisilicate=Lithiummetasilicate+SiO2).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a Scanning Electron microscope (SEM) micrograph of a glass ceramic known from the prior art. FIG. 2 is a Scanning Electron microscope (SEM) micrograph of a glass ceramic according to the present invention. FIG. 3 is a Scanning Electron microscope (SEM) micrograph of a glass ceramic with a low content of stabilizer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As can be seen from the figures, the glass ceramic according to the present invention shows much better results resulting in a higher translucency as the prior art glass ceramic of FIG. 1. The glass ceramic of FIG. 3 has a lower amount of stabilizer (4 wt-%) and shows a number of white spots of the stabilizer (ZrO2) which results opaque ceramic which is undesirable in the dental field. Example 1 In Table 1, compositions which are given by way of example are mentioned, from which high zirconium oxide-containing metasilicate glass ceramics can be produced for the dental field.

The blocks were stress-relieved in the oven at 560° C. and cooled down slowly. For the various characterisation processes, the glass blocks were divided up and subjected to a first crystallization treatment. For this purpose, the glasses were stored for 10 to 120 minutes at 600° C. to 750° C. As a result of this, glass ceramics with strength values of 150 MPa to 220 MPa (measured according to DIN ISO 6872) were produced. Exclusively lithium metasilicate was hereby established as crystal phase. In this state, processing by means of CAD/CAM methods is possible very readily. With a second short crystallization at 800° C. to 950° C. for 3 to 15 minutes, the crystallization is continued and the result is an increase in strength from 300 MPa to 450 MPa (measured according to DIN ISO 6872). In addition to the lithium metasilicate phase, a zirconium oxide-containing subsidiary crystal phase can hereby be produced. Also a small conversion of lithium metasilicate into lithium disilicate is possible. The unambiguous main crystal phase remains the lithium metasilicate. In Table 2, the crystallization conditions of individual glasses and also the resulting crystal phases and strength values are displayed. TABLE 2 Glass G1 G2 G3 G4 G5 G6 1.
