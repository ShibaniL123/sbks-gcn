CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119 to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/954,185, filed Mar. 17, 2014, entitled “Water-Based Polypropylene Coating Having Water Resistance” (Docket MIH 0106 MA/40504.199), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND The present specification relates generally to coating compositions. More specifically, the present specification relates to water-based coating compositions for adhering a polypropylene layer to a substrate, to coated substrates, and to methods of adhering a polypropylene layer to a substrate. BACKGROUND In the packaging industry, heat-sealable films are often employed. By way of example, polypropylene films are often heat sealed to substrates for use in the flexible food packaging and/or flexible medical packaging industries. However, because such polypropylene films generally exhibit poor heat sealing characteristics, coating compositions are typically employed to adhere and heat seal the polypropylene films to the substrates. While several such coating compositions are known, they possess several disadvantages and limitations. For example, some coating compositions are solvent based, and thus may be hazardous. Additionally, some coating compositions are useful only with co-extruded polypropylene resins, which may be expensive to produce. Accordingly, additional embodiments of coating compositions for adhering polypropylene layers to substrates are desired. SUMMARY According to one or more embodiments, a water-based coating composition for adhering a polypropylene layer to a substrate is disclosed. The water-based coating includes a C2-C3 maleated polyolefin, a non-ionic surfactant, an anionic surfactant, and an amine. The water-based coating composition enhances adhesion of the polypropylene layer to the substrate upon application therebetween. In other embodiments, a coated substrate is disclosed. The coated substrate includes a substrate having surfaces, a water-based coating composition applied to at least one of the surfaces of the substrate, and a polypropylene layer applied to the water-based coating composition. The water-based coating composition includes a C2-C3 maleated polyolefin, a non-ionic surfactant, an anionic surfactant, and an amine. The water-based coating composition applied to the surfaces of the substrate enhances adhesion of the polypropylene layer to the substrate. In still other embodiments, a method of adhering a polypropylene layer to a substrate is disclosed. The method includes providing the substrate, wherein the substrate has surfaces, applying a water-based coating composition to at least one of the surfaces of the substrate, and applying the polypropylene layer to the water-based coating composition. The water-based coating composition includes a C2-C3 maleated polyolefin, a non-ionic surfactant, an anionic surfactant, and an amine. The water-based coating composition enhances adhesion between the polypropylene layer and the substrate. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description describe various embodiments and are intended to provide an overview or framework for understanding the nature and character of the claimed subject matter. The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of the various embodiments, and are incorporated into and constitute a part of this specification. The drawings illustrate the various embodiments described herein, and together with the description serve to explain the principles and operations of the claimed subject matter. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The following terms are used in the present application: As used herein, the term “water-based” describes a water content of at least 60% by weight of a coating composition. In some embodiments, the water content is from about 60% to about 80% by weight of the coating composition, or from about 65% to about 75% by weight of the coating composition, or from about 70% to about 74% by weight of the coating composition, or about 72% by weight of the coating composition. As used herein, the terms “adhesion” “adhesive” and/or “adhere” describe the bond strength and/or permanence of attachment of a polypropylene layer to a substrate via a coating composition. In some embodiments, adhesion is determined via seal strength testing, including both dry and wet seal strength testing. Wet seal strength testing may be a measure of how resistant performance of a coating composition is to sustained contact with water. As used herein, the term “polypropylene layer” describes a layer including a polypropylene, a polypropylene copolymer, and combinations thereof. The polypropylene in the layer may be unbranched and/or branched. For example, the polypropylene layer includes a polypropylene homopolymer, a polypropylene blend, and/or a polypropylene in combination with a thermoplastic polyolefin. In embodiments, the polypropylene layer includes a cast film of polypropylene, an extruded polypropylene resin, and/or a thermoplastic polyolefin. As used herein, the term “C2-C3 maleated polyolefin” describes a maleated polypropylene, a maleated polyethylene, and/or a maleated ethylene/propylene copolymer. For example, the C2-C3 maleated polyolefin includes a polypropylene, a polyethylene, and/or a ethylene/propylene copolymer having maleic anhydride groups grafted and/or attached thereon. In the context of coating compositions, as used herein, the term “enhance” describes an increase in the adhesion and/or seal strength (including both dry and wet) of a polypropylene layer to a substrate relative to comparative compositions. For example, in the context of coating compositions, the wet seal strength of a polypropylene layer adhered and/or heat-sealed to a substrate with coating composition 1 was about 412 g/in, whereas the wet seal strength of a polypropylene layer adhered to and/or heat-sealed to a substrate with a comparative coating composition was about 67 g/in. Thus, adhesion and/or seal strength of the polypropylene layer to the substrate was enhanced in the presence of coating composition 1 (relative to comparative coating composition 1). As used herein, the term “primer” describes a coating composition having a coat weight of from about 0.1 g/m2 to about 5 g/m2, or from about 0.2 g/m2 to about 3 g/m2, or from about 0.5 g/m2 to about 1.5 g/m2, or about 1 g/m2.

The seal strengths of a coating composition and a comparative coating composition were studied. More particularly, the dry and wet seal strengths of a water-based coating composition and a comparative coating composition were studied. The coating composition employed is as set forth in Table 1 (below) and the comparative coating composition employed is as set forth in Table 2 (below).

More specifically, each of the coating compositions set forth in Tables 1-2 were respectively prepared by mixing the components thereof in a stifling vessel under high temperature (about 160° C.) and pressure. Although Coating Composition 1 includes a maleated polypropylene, it is contemplated that coating compositions employing a maleated polyethylene and/or a maleated ethylene/propylene copolymer, such as, e.g., instead of the maleated polypropylene, would be similarly prepared. Upon preparation of the coating compositions set forth in Tables 1-2, water-based coating composition 1 (2.0 grams dry) and comparative coating composition 1 (2.3 grams dry) were respectively applied to a surface of an aluminum foil substrate with a Mayer rod (RD Specialties, Inc., Webster, N.Y.). Upon application of the coating compositions to the aluminum foil substrates, the coated aluminum foil substrates were dried in a hot air oven at 105° C. Cast polypropylene films were then heat sealed via placement of the coated aluminum foil substrates and the cast polypropylene film in a heat sealer (TS-12 Heat Sealer, Lako-Tool Innovative Packaging Solutions, Perrysburg, Ohio) for 1-2 seconds at 180° C. and 60 psi. Upon heat sealing, the heat-sealed coated aluminum foil substrates and polypropylene films were trimmed such that they contained an approximately 1 inch by 1 inch sealed region along with a 4 inch to seven inch long tab. Next, with regard to dry seal strength, the dry seal strengths of the heat-sealed aluminum foil substrate coated with the water-based coating composition 1 or the comparative coating composition 1 were determined in accordance with ASTM Standard F88. More particularly, the dry seal strength of the heat-sealed coated aluminum foil substrate was determined with a Vantage 2 Tensile Tester (Thwing-Albert, West Berlin, N.J.) using MAP-3.0 software. The specific parameters to determine the dry seal strength were as follows: (1) sample width was 1 inch; (2) pre-peel distance was −0.5 inches; (3) peel distance was 2 inches; and (4) test speed was 12 inches/min. The heat-sealed coated aluminum foil substrate was clamped into a sampling area of the Vantage 2 Tensile Tester such that the sealed area was at a 90° angle relative to the clamp tabs of the Vantage 2 Tensile Tester. The dry seal strength of the coated aluminum foil substrate was determined in triplicate, in order to gauge repeatability and/or reproducibility. The average force of the three trials was reported where failure mode was peel; the highest force of the three trials was reported where failure mode was a break and/or tear in the aluminum foil substrate.

More specifically, each of the coating compositions set forth in Tables 5-7 were respectively prepared by mixing the components thereof in a stifling vessel under high temperature (about 160° C.) and pressure. Although Coating Compositions 2-4 include a maleated polypropylene, it is contemplated that coating compositions employing a maleated polyethylene and/or a maleated ethylene/propylene copolymer, such as, e.g., instead of the maleated polypropylene, would be similarly prepared. Upon preparation of the coating compositions set forth in Tables 5-7, coating compositions 2-4 (1.6 grams dry) were respectively applied to a surface of a biaxially oriented polypropylene film substrate with a Mayer rod (RD Specialties, Inc., Webster, N.Y.). Heat sealing of cast polypropylene film to the coated surfaces of the biaxially oriented polypropylene film substrates was achieved via placement of the coated biaxially oriented polypropylene film substrate and cast polypropylene film in a heat sealer (TS-12 Heat Sealer, Lako-Tool Innovative Packaging Solutions, Perrysburg, Ohio) for 1-2 seconds at 180° C. and 60 psi. Upon heat sealing, the heat-sealed coated biaxially oriented polypropylene film substrates and polypropylene film were trimmed such that they contained an approximately 1 inch by 1 inch sealed region along with a 4 inch to seven inch long tab. Next, with regard to dry seal strength, the dry seal strengths of the heat-sealed coated biaxially oriented polypropylene film substrates and polypropylene film were determined in accordance with ASTM Standard F88. More particularly, the dry seal strengths of the heat-sealed coated biaxially oriented polypropylene film substrates and polypropylene film were determined with a Vantage 2 Tensile Tester (Thwing-Albert, West Berlin, N.J.) using MAP-3.0 software. The specific parameters to determine the dry seal strength were as follows: (1) sample width was 1 inch; (2) pre-peel distance was -0.5 inches; (3) peel distance was 2 inches; and (4) test speed was 12 inches/min. The heat-sealed coated biaxially oriented polypropylene film substrates were clamped into a sampling area of the Vantage 2 Tensile Tester such that the sealed area was at a 90° angle relative to the clamp tabs of the Vantage 2 Tensile Tester. The dry seal strength of each of the coated biaxially oriented polypropylene film substrates was determined in triplicate, in order to gauge repeatability and/or reproducibility. The average force of the three trials was reported where failure mode was peel; the highest force of the three trials was reported where failure mode was a break and/or tear in the biaxially oriented polypropylene film substrate. With regard to determining wet seal strength, the wet seal strengths of the heat-sealed aluminum foil substrates coated with the water-based coating compositions 2, 3, or 4 were determined in accordance with ASTM Standard F88. More particularly, the procedure as previously described with regard to determining dry seal strength was employed, except that the heat-sealed coated biaxially oriented polypropylene film substrates and polypropylene films were subjected to water immersion for 24 hours in a vessel prior to testing in the Vantage 2 Tensile Tester.
