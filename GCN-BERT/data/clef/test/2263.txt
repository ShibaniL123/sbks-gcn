111.6: 2-(5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-2,6-dioxo-3-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-methyl propionate (compound 111)
A solution containing 125 mg (0.4 mmol) of 2-[5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-methyl propionate in 2.5 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide is added to 148 mg (0.5 mmol) of 3-[1-(2-chloroacetyl)-piperidin-4-yl]-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one, 63 mg (0.5 mmol) of potassium carbonate and 13 mg (0.1 mmol) of potassium iodide. The mixture is stirred for 45 minutes at 50Â° C. It is hydrolysed and then extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with water and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated to dryness. The yellow oil obtained is purified by preparative HPLC. After evaporation, 95 mg (40%) of 2-(5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-2,6-dioxo-3-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-methyl propionate is obtained in the form of a white solid.
