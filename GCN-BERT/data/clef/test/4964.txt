Example 22
To a suspension of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.075 g, 0.306 mmol) and 4-ethyl-1,3-thiazole carboxylic acid (0.055 g, 0.351 mmol), and pyridine (0.11 mL, 1.381 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.64 mL, 1.072 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 50° C. for 7 days. After cooling, the mixture was quenched with water (10 mL) and extracted with 8:2 dichloromethane/isopropanol (2×25 mL) followed by washing once with sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The crude mixture was purified by precipitation in minium amount of dichloromethane. The obtained solid was collected by filtration and washed with cold dichloromethane to give 4-ethyl-N-(4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)thiazole-5-carboxamide (0.090 g, 76%) as an off-white solid.
