TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to novel N-acylhydrazone derivatives, and more particularly to novel N-acylhydrazone derivatives having selective T cell inhibitory activity and/or anti-lymphoid malignancy activity, stereoisomers thereof, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, the use thereof for preparing pharmaceutical compositions, pharmaceutical compositions containing the same, treatment methods using the compositions, and methods for preparing the novel N-acylhydrazone derivatives. BACKGROUND ART Immunosuppressant Drugs The key issue of the transplantation field is to suppress the immune responses leading to graft rejection. Thus, the development of immunosuppressive drugs capable of selectively and effectively regulating immune responses specific to grafts is a key issue to increase the success rate of transplantation. T cells are the major target to prevent the transplant rejection, and most immunosuppressive drugs clinically used inhibit the T cell responses. Azathioprine is the first immunosuppressant used in organ transplantation. However, azathioprine inhibits DNA synthesis, resulting in side effects such as leukopenia, bone marrow suppression and macrocytosis, and thus was converted to a second-line therapy after the introduction of cyclosporine. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus, which are calcineurin inhibitors, are currently being used as first-line therapy in organ transplantation. The two drugs block the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) by inhibitoin of calcineurin. Further, these drugs can suppress the T cell activation in the initial stage, and thus strongly suppress the immune responses leading to graft rejection. However, these drugs are required to be administered over a long period and cause side effects, including nephrotoxicity, anemia and hypertension, as well as infectious diseases and tumors caused by a weakening in the immune system. In recent years, in order to reduce the side effects of the calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil that is an inhibitor of nucleotide synthesis has been administered in combination with the calcineurin inhibitor, but has shown side effects such as digestive disease, leukopenia and anemia. Sirolimus and everolimus, which are inhibitors of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), are drugs that inhibit the proliferation of T cells by blockade of IL-2 receptor signaling. These drugs are mainly administered in combination with the calcineurin inhibitor, because the efficacy is mild when these are administered alone. However, these drugs increase the side effects of the calcineurin inhibitor, such as hyperlipidemia and thrombocytopenia. FTY720, an antagonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate, is a drug that reduces immune responses by blocking the T cell migration from lymphoid organs to grafts, and has an advantage of low toxicity compared to other drugs. However, FTY720 can cause heart attack when it is administered with other drugs (e.g., general anesthetics and beta-blockers). In the organ transplantation field, combination therapy with cyclosporine is in clinical trials (see N Engl J Med. 351, 2715-2729; N Engl J Med. 352, 1371-1373; Nat Med. 11, 605-613; Business Insights. 2010, BI100022-067). As described above, the current immunosuppressants for preventing transplant rejection are toxic and cause many side effects such as the occurrence of infection and tumors by weakening the immune system. Thus, the development of new drugs capable of selectively depleting T cells that respond to transplantation antigens is required. Graft-Versus-Host Disease Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the most effective and permanent treatment method for various malignant blood diseases and immune deficiency diseases and is being used for treatment of about 20,000 or more patients annually worldwide (as reported by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research). In recent years, the application of the HSCT to autoimmune diseases, solid cancers and the organ transplantation field has been attempted. Despite the rapid development of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (e.g., the development of HLA identification technology and new immunosuppressants) during the past 20 years, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that is a complication caused by donor T cells still remains as the major cause of post transplantation mortality. Acute GVHD (grades II-IV) that occurs mainly before 100 days after transplantation appears in 25-60% of the patients in the case of HLA matching between blood relations and 45-70% of the patients in the case of non-blood relation, and 70% or more of patients with the disease (grades III-IV) die. Acute GVHD develops in three stages. In the first stage, proinflammatory factors (TNF-α and LPS) produced by high-dose chemotherapy and systemic radiotherapy before transplantation, activate the dendritic cells of peripheral lymphoid organs. In the second stage, alloantigen-specific T cells proliferate by activated dendritic cells and differentiate into effector cells. In the final stage, the alloantigen-specific effector T cells migrate the gut, the liver and the skin, which are major target organs, and cause inflammatory injury to tissues. The response rate of the calcineurin inhibitor that is a first-line therapy for preventing acute GVHD is about less than 50%, and thus the prevention rate is very low compared to that of organ transplantation. Treatment after GVHD development depends on steroid therapy, but the steroid therapy shows a response rate of less than 50%, and thus is classified as high-risk therapy having high therapy-related mortality (see Annu Rev Immunol. 25, 139-170; Blood. 114, 4327-4336; Lancet. 373, 1550-1561, Curr Opin Immunol. 11, 509-515). Thus, the development of new effective drugs for the prevention and treatment of acute GVHD is urgently required. Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS), which is an autoimmune disease caused by T cells reacting to the myelin-derived antigen. It shows a relapse-remitting pattern in the initial stage of development, and then progresses into secondary progressive multiple sclerosis due to the progressive accumulation of brain and spinal cord lesions. The accumulation of brain and spinal cord lesions leads to visual loss, movement and balance disorders, language and sensory disorders, paraplegia, sexual function impairment, and disturbances of urination and evacuation, and when the accumulation is severe, it causes systemic paralysis. Therapies for treating multiple sclerosis are largely divided into management of acute exacerbations, disease-modifying therapy, symptomatic therapy, and preventive therapy. The management of acute exacerbations are performed to weaken inflammation and provide immunosuppressant effects, and the disease-modifying therapy is performed to retard the progression of the disease so as to prevent the disease from developing into progressive multiple sclerosis. In the management of acute exacerbations, a high dose (500-1000 mg/kg) of glucocorticoid is administered intravenously for 3-5 days in order to alleviate the symptoms and prevent permanent injury. Glucocorticoid functions to inhibit the migration of immune cells into the brain or reduce edema, thereby inhibiting inflammation that occurred in the acute stage (see Immunology and Cell Biology. 76, 55-64; Annu. Rev. Immunol. 20, 125-163). Although glucocorticoid exhibits an excellent effect in the acute stage, it cannot prevent the progression of the disease in the disease-modifying therapy. In the disease-modifying therapy, immunotherapy is performed in order to treat the disease and prevent the recurrence of the disease. Drugs approved by the US FDA for immunotherapy include interferon-beta (IFN-β), glatiramer acetate (GA), mitoxantrone and natalizumab. However, they show the following side effect (see N Engl J Med. 362, 456-458): IFN-β, a drug that is currently most popularly used, has anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects and acts to inhibit the expression of antigens and prevent the activation of T cells. In addition, IFN-3 activates co-stimulatory molecules to induce the apoptosis of self-reactive cells. However, IFN-3 can be administered only by an intramuscular or subcutaneous route, and thus when it is administered for a long period of time, it causes erythema and edema at the injected site and involves side effects, including muscular pain, chills and autoimmune disease. Mitoxantrone (novatrone) has very low molecular weight, and thus passes through the meninges to inhibit the proliferation of T cells, B cells and macrophages in the meninges and the antigen presenting function of antigen presenting cells (APCs), thereby alleviating the symptom of multiple sclerosis. However, mitoxantrone has a defect in that the dose should be limited, because it places a heavy burden on the heart. Glatiramer acetate (GA) is an analogue of myelin basic protein (MBP). GA forms a GA/MHC complex when MBP binds to a HLA class II molecule, and thus it inhibits the activation of MBP-reactive T cells by competition with MBP when it binds to T cell receptor (TCR). GA has the effects of reducing the number of relapses of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and alleviating the symptom of multiple sclerosis upon the relapse of multiple sclerosis, like IFN-β, but shows an increase frequency of development of permanent black holes in the central nervous system compared to IFN-β. Natalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds directly to the α4 subunit (CD49; adhesion molecule on the surface of leukocytes) of integrin VLA 4 (very late antigen 4) to prevent the binding between leukocytes and vascular endothelial cells, thereby preventing active T cells from entering the central nervous system. It shows excellent effects on relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, but causes a side effect of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in 0.3-0.9% of the patients after 2 years of administration. Fingolimod is a synthetic analogue of S1P (sphingosine 1-phosphate) receptor for myriocin and is the first orally administered drug recently approved by the US FDA. Fingolimod acts to prevent activated lymphocytes from moving from secondary lymphoid tissues to the central nervous system by binding of S1PR to the surface of activated type 1 helper T cells. However, the drugs in developing were reported to have side effects, including infection, macular edema, headache, influenza, diarrhea, lumbago and an increase in liver enzyme (see Nat. Rev. Neurol. 7, 255-262; Nat Rev Drug Discov. 11, 909-925). Thus, there is a need for the development of new drugs that can block the progression to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis while showing high therapeutic effects by short-term oral administration (see N Engl J Med. 362, 456-458). Lymphoid Malignancy As used herein, the term “lymphoid malignancy” refers to a tumor of lymphoid cells (B cells, T cells and NK/T cells) in bone marrow and lymphoid tissue. Lymphoid malignancy is largely classified into leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Lymphoid leukemia is a blood tumor in which immature lymphocytes in bone marrow change to cancer cells that are accumulated in tissue and spread systemically through blood. Lymphoid leukemia is largely classified into acute lymphoid leukemia and chronic lymphoid leukemia. Lymphoma is a blood tumor in which lymphocytes in lymphoid tissue change to cancer cells that are accumulated in the tissue and spread to peripheral blood and bone marrow. It is classified into Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Multiple myeloma is a blood tumor in which plasma cells in peripheral lymphoid tissue change to cancer cells that are then accumulated in bone marrow (see J Clin Invest. 2012; 122:3396-3397; Blood. 1994; 84:1361-1392; Lancet. 2012; 380:848-857). Treatment of lymphoid malignancy is performed by standard chemotherapy using a combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone. With respect to the initial response effects of the drugs, the remission rate of adult patients is as high as about 85%, but the recurrence rate is high, and thus the 5-year disease-free survival is only 30-40%. In addition, the drugs show a high risk of infection due to their high cytotoxicity and frequently cause side effects, including neurotoxicity, digestive problems and bleeding (see N Engl J Med. 1998; 339:21-26; N Engl J Med 2006; 354:166-78; Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2007; 6:149-165). Recently, it has been reported that drugs having cytotoxic effects on specific cells also have anti-tumor effects when the same cells change to cancer cells. The B cell immunosuppressant ibrutinib that inhibits Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a signaling mediator of B cell receptor (BCR), was reported to have an anticancer effect against relapsing or drug-refractory B cell lymphoma. Bortezomib that is an inhibitor of NF-κB activity is used as an immunosuppressant for inhibiting memory T cells and B cells. Bortezomib was approved by the US FDA as a therapeutic agent for treating multiple sclerosis and has also recently been used in combination with ibrutinib for B cell lymphoma. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) that is histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) is known to have an anticancer effect against cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Since the inhibitory effect of SAHA against graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was recently found in animal models, SAHA has received new attention as an immunosuppressant (see Semin Cancer Biol. 2011 November; 21:335-46; Br J Haematol. 2013; 161:43-56; N Engl J Med. 2008; 359:906-917; Nat Rev Drug Discov. 2006; 5:769-784; J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118:2562-2573). Thus, an immunosuppressive drug that targets specific immune cells can be clinically used as a new anticancer agent capable of specifically targeting a specific tumor.

Jurkat T cells cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were collected and stained with trypan blue (Sigma). The results of the staining showed that the viability of the cells was 97% or higher. Then, the cells were centrifuged at 1200 rpm at room temperature for 5 minutes and re-suspended in 10% FBS-containing RPMI medium at a concentration of 1.5×105 cells/mL. 200 μL of the cell suspension was dispensed into each well of a flat bottom 96-well plate (Costar). Then, the cells were treated with 10 μL of the diluted compounds in RPMI medium at final concentrations of 1 M or 5 μM, and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37° C. for 72 hours. In a vehicle control group, the cells were treated with 10 μL of RPMI medium containing 1% of dimetylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma). The incubated cells were harvested, put into 5-mL FACS tubes (BD Falcon), washed with 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and then re-suspended in 0.1 mL of binding buffer (10 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mL CaCl2).

The stained cells were suspended in 0.3 mL of binding buffer and analyzed by a flow cytometer. Apoptosis was determined by the ratio (%) of cells stained with FITC-Annexin V and 7-AAD among the total cells (see Tables 10 and 11).

The lymph nodes and spleens were aseptically collected from normal C57BL/6 mice (8-12 week old, female, 20±2 g) and were ground with adding of RPMI medium. Then, the ground tissues were passed through a cell strainer (BD Falcon) to make single cell suspensions. The single cell suspension of the spleen was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was removed, and then 1 mL of ammonium chloride/potassium bicarbonate (ACK) lysis buffer (0.15 M NH4Cl, 1 mM KHCO3, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA) was added to the cells, which were then vortexed for 1 minute and washed with RPMI medium. The erythrocyte-lysed spleen cells were centrifuged together with the lymph node cells, and then re-suspended in 1 mL of magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) buffer (0.5% BSA, 2 mM EDTA in PBS), and 100 μL of mouse CD90.2 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) were added to the cells which were then incubated at 4° C. for 15 minutes. The incubated cell suspension was added with 10 mL of MACS buffer, centrifuged for 5 minutes, washed, and then re-suspended in 2 mL of MACS buffer. The suspended cells were placed in the autoMACS Pro Separator (Miltenyi Biotec), and T cells bound to CD90.2 microbeads were isolated. The isolated T cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and then re-suspended in PBS at a concentration of 1×108 cells/mL. Normal BALB/c mice (10-12 week old, female, 20-23 g) were irradiated with 950 rad of γ radiation using IBL 437C irradiator (CIS bio international), and then 100 μL of the above-prepared T cell suspension of C57BL/6 mice were injected into the tail vein of the BALB/c mice. At 3 days after the cell injection, the mice were sacrificed, and the spleens were obtained. An erythrocyte-free single cell suspension was made from the obtained spleens in the same manner as described above, and donor T cells were separated from the spleen cell suspension using the autoMACS Pro Separator, thereby preparing secondary responder cells. Meanwhile, T cells were isolated from normal C57BL/6 mice in the same manner as described above, thereby preparing primary responder cells. Each of the primary and secondary responder cells were re-suspended in 1 mL of 1% FBS-containing PBS, and treated with 3 μM of carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Invitrogen), and then allowed to react at room temperature for 4 minutes. To stop the reaction, cold-stored 5% FBS-containing PBS was added to the cell suspension, followed by washing. The washed cells were re-suspended in 10% FBS-containing RPMI medium at a concentration of 2×106/mL. The spleens of normal BALB/c mice (8-12 week old, female, 20±2 g) were aseptically collected. The erythrocyte-free spleen cells were prepared in the same manner as described above, and then re-suspended in 1 mL of PBS. 0.5 mg/mL of Mitomycin-C(Sigma) was added to the suspension at a concentration of 0.5 μg/mL, and the cells were incubated at 37° C. for 20 minutes, and then washed three times with an excessive amount of PBS. The washed cells were re-suspended in 10% FBS-containing RPMI medium at a concentration of 4×106 cells/mL, thereby preparing stimulator cells. The primary and secondary responder cells were mixed with the stimulator cells at a ratio of 1:1 separately, and 200 μL of each cell mixtures was dispensed into each well of a round bottom 96-well plate (Costar). Then, the cells were treated with 10 μL of Compound 229 diluted in RPMI medium at various concentrations, and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37° C. for 72 hours. In a vehicle control group, the cells were 10 μL of 0.2% DMSO-containing RPMI medium. The incubated cells were placed into 5-mL FACS tubes and washed with 1 mL of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (1% FBS and 0.1% sodium azaide in PBS). The washed cells were re-suspended in 0.1 mL of FACS buffer, and then treated with 1 μg of mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG, e-Biosciences) in order to prevent the non-specific binding of antibody, followed by incubation at 4° C. for 15 minutes. Then, the cells were stained with 0.5 μg of phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse H-2Kb mAb (e-Biosciences) and stained at 4° C. for 30 minutes. After the staining, the cells were washed twice with 1 mL of FACS buffer, re-suspended in 0.1 mL of FACS buffer, stained with 7-AAD at room temperature for 5 minutes. The stained cells were suspended in 0.3 mL of FACS buffer and then analyzed by a flow cytometer. The inhibition of T cell proliferation was determined by measuring the ratio (%) of a cell fraction having a low fluorescence intensity of CFSE among the total live responder cells, and the apoptosis of the T cells was determined by measuring the ratio (%) of cells stained with 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) among the total responder cells. The results indicated that the ratio of T cells (CFSElow) that proliferated in response to the alloantigen in vehicle control group was 50% of the total T cells, but was reduced to 3% or less in the test group treated with 0.5 μM or higher of compound 229, suggesting that the proliferation of T cells that responded to the alloantigen was significantly inhibited. In addition, under the conditions of secondary response in which T cells activated primarily by the alloantigen in vivo reacted with the same antigen in vitro, compound 229 effectively inhibited the proliferation of the alloantigen-specific T cells (see FIG. 1). In order to examine whether the inhibitory effect of compound 229 against the alloantigen-specific T cells is attributable to the induction of apoptosis, the cells were stained with 7-AAD and analyzed by flow cytometry. As a result, it was shown that, in the primary response, the apoptosis of the test group treated with 0.5 μM or higher of compound 229 increased by 14-19% compared to that of the vehicle control group, and in the secondary response, the apoptosis of the test group treated with 0.25 μM or higher of compound 229 significantly increased (21-42%) compared to the vehicle control group (see FIG. 2 and Table 12). TABLE 12 Concentrations of Apoptosis % (mean ± SD) Compound 229 (μM) Primary Response Secondary Response 0 30.91 ± 3.80 39.10 ± 4.10 0.125 28.42 ± 5.31 41.40 ± 4.35 0.25 31.20 ± 4.26 60.27 ± 6.10 ** 0.5 45.01 ± 5.48 * 81.70 ± 5.62 *** 1 50.37 ± 6.19 ** 80.37 ± 7.16 *** * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 Thus, compound 229 according to the present invention has an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of all T cells that primarily and secondarily respond to the alloantigen, and this proliferation-inhibitory effect is caused by the induction of apoptosis. In addition, the proliferation of the secondarily activated T cells is inhibited even at a lower concentration of compound 229, and thus compound 229 can be effectively used as an immunosuppressive agent not only for preventing, but also for treating transplant rejection. Experimental Example 3 Inhibitory Effect on Alloantigen-Specific T Cells In Vivo In order to examine whether compound 229 according to the present invention has an inhibitory effect against T cells that respond to an alloantigen in vivo, an experiment was performed in animal models in the following manner. Lymph nodes and spleens were aseptically collected from normal C57BL/6-Ly5.1 mice (8-12 week old, female, 20±2 g), and T cells were isolated in the same manner as described in Experimental Example 2, and were then re-suspended in PBS at a concentration of 1×108 cells/mL. Normal BDF1 mice (10-12 week old, female, 20-23 g) were irradiated with 950 rad of γ radiation, and then 100 μL of the above-prepared T cells of C57BL/6-Ly5.1 mice were injected into the tail vein of the BDF1 mice. Compound 229 was completely dissolved in a Cremophor EL (Sigma)/ethanol mixture (1:1, v/v) in an amount corresponding to 15% (v/v) of the administration volume for intraperitoneal administration and in an amount corresponding to 7.5% (v/v) for oral administration, and the compound solution was diluted in PBS. The dilution was administered intraperitoneally (200 μL/mouse) or orally (500 μL/mouse) every day for 5 days from the day of the cell injection. A vehicle control group was administered with a Cremophor EL-ethanol-PBS mixture in the same ratio and volume as those of the test group. At 6 days after the cell injection, the mice were sacrificed, the spleens were collected from the mice, and erythrocyte-free spleen cells were made in the same manner as described in Experimental Example 2. The spleen cells were stained with trypan blue, and the number of viable cells per organ of each animal was counted. Then, the spleen cells were put into 5 mL FACS tubes and washed with 1 mL of FACS buffer. The cells were re-suspended in 0.1 mL of FACS buffer, and then treated with 1 g of mouse immunoglobulin G in order to prevent the non-specific binding of antibody, followed by incubation at 4° C. for 15 minutes. Then, the cells were stained with 0.5 μg of phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse Ly5.1 mAb (monoclonal antibody) at 4° C. for 30 minutes. The stained cells were washed twice with 1 mL of FACS buffer, re-suspended in 0.3 mL of FACS buffer and analyzed by a flow cytometer. The number of donor T cells in the spleen was determined by measuring the ratio (%) of a donor T cell fraction (Ly5.1+ cells) relative to viable cells per spleen. As a result, it was shown that the number of alloantigen-specific T cells in the spleen of the mice administered intraperitoneally (FIG. 3A) or orally (FIG. 3B) with compound 229 of the present invention significantly decreased compared to that in the vehicle control group in a concentration-dependent manner, and when compound 229 was administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg, the number of activated T cells was significantly decreased, which suggests that the proliferation of T cells that responded to the alloantigen was completely inhibited (see FIGS. 3A and 3B). Thus, compound 229 according to the present invention has the inhibitory effect on alloantigen-specific T cell in vivo, and is also likely to be developed as an oral immunosuppressive agent. Experimental Example 4 Inhibitory Effect Against Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease In order to examine the inhibitory effect of compound 229 of the present invention against acute graft-versus-host disease, acute graft-versus-host disease was induced in mouse model of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation as described below, the mice were treated with compound 229, and the effect of the compound was evaluated. Lymph nodes, spleens, both femurs and tibias were aseptically collected from normal C57BL/6 mice (8-12 week old, female, 20-23 g), and T cells were isolated from the lymph nodes and spleens in the same manner as described in Experimental Example 2 and were re-suspended in PBS at a concentration of 8×107 cells/mL. The femurs and tibias were cut at the ends, and the bone marrow was flushed from femurs and tibias with RPMI medium using a syringe (21G for femur and 26G for tibia) to extract the marrow, which was then suspended and passed through a cell strainer to make a single cell suspension. The bone marrow cell suspension was centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes, and the supernatant was removed, then the cells were added to 1 mL of ACK lysis buffer and vortexed for 1 minute, followed by washing with RPMI medium. The bone marrow cells collected by centrifugation were re-suspended on 300 μL of MACS buffer, and 30 μL of CD90.2 microbeads were added thereto, followed by incubation at 4° C. for 15 minutes. The incubated cell suspension was added with 5 mL of MACS buffer, centrifuged for 5 minutes, washed, and then re-suspended in 2 mL of MACS buffer. The suspended cells were placed in the autoMACS Pro Separator, and T cells bound to the CD90.2 microbeads were removed. The separated T cell-depleted bone marrow cells (TCD-BM) were washed with PBS and re-suspended in PBS at a concentration of 1×108 cells/mL. Normal BDF1 mice (10-12 week old, female, 20-23 g) were irradiated with 850 rad of γ radiation using an irradiator, and then 100 μL of a graft obtained by mixing the C57BL/6 mouse T cells and the TCD-BM at a ratio of 1:1 was injected into the tail vein of the BDF1 mice. In a group treated with compound 229 of the present invention, compound 229 was completely dissolved in a Cremophor EL-ethanol mixture (1:1, v/v) in an amount corresponding to 15% (v/v) of the administration volume, after which the compound solution was diluted in PBS, and the dilution was administered intraperitoneally to each mouse at a dose of 25 mg/kg daily for 10 days from the day of the graft injection. Meanwhile, Tacrolimus that is a currently clinically used immunosuppressive agent was administered to mice of another group in the same amount as compound 229 in order to compare the inhibitory effect on acute graft-versus-host disease, and mice of a vehicle control group were administered with 200 μL of a Cremophor EL-ethanol-PBS (7.5:7.5:85, v/v/v) in the same manner as the treated groups. Then, the survival of mice was monitored daily, and the severity of GVHD was assessed twice a week with clinical GVHD scoring system for each a decrease in weight loss, hunched posture, decreased activity, fur ruffling and skin lesions. Each parameters were scored on a 3-point (0 to 2) scale. As a result, the mice of the vehicle control group started to die from 29 days after cell transplantation and showed a survival rate of 10% at day 70, and the mice of the group treated with Tacrolimus started to die from 23 days and finally showed a survival rate of 50%. Meanwhile, the group treated with compound 229 of the present invention showed mouse death at 35 days and 46 days after cell transplantation, but finally showed a mouse survival rate of 80%, which was significantly higher than that of the vehicle control group. Also, the survival rate of the group treated with compound 229 increased compared to that of the Tacrolimus-treated group, but this increase was not significant (see FIG. 4A). In the results of evaluating the severity of GVHD using the clinical scoring system, in the mice treated with Tacrolimus, ruffled fur and severe skin lesions were observed, whereas in the mice treated with compound 229, slight symptoms of GVHD, including a slight weight loss, were observed. This reduction in GVHD symptoms by treatment with compound 229 was statistically significant (see FIG. 4B). Accordingly, compound 229 of the present invention has the inhibitory effect on GVHD in mouse models, and the inhibitory effect of compound 229 is superior to that of the conventional immunosuppressive agent Tacrolimus. Thus, compound 229 of the present invention can be effectively used as a novel immunosuppressive agent. Experimental Example 5 Effect on Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis In order to examine the therapeutic effect of compound 229 of the present invention against multiple sclerosis, Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in murine models as described below, the mice were treated with compound 229, and the effect of the compound was evaluated. At the first day of induction, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein35-55 (MOG35-55, Peptron) (200 ug), mycobacterium tuberculosis (Difco, Cat No. 231141) (500 μg) and complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma Aldrich, Cat No. F5506) were mixed with each other and immersed for 5 minutes. 0.1 mL of the immersed peptide was injected subcutaneously into both the flanks of each of C57BL/6 mice (9 week old, female, 18±2 g), followed by that 0.1 mg of pertussis toxin (Sigma Aldrich, Cat No. P2980) (200 ng) was injected by intravenously. At 2 days, the same amount of pertussis toxin was administered intravenously. Whether the immersion leaked from the injected portion of the mice was checked, and whether EAE was induced was also examined by visual observation from 7 days. Compound 229 and Fingolimod that is currently clinically used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis were completely dissolved in a Cremophor EL-ethanol mixture (1:1, v/v) in an amount corresponding to 7.5% (v/v) of the administration volume, and the compound solution was diluted in PBS. The two groups of the mice were administered orally with 200 μL of the diluted solution of compound 229 at each doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg separately, and the third group of the mice was administered orally with 200 μL of the diluted solution of fingolimode at a dose of 1 mg/kg on a daily basis from 17 days to 37 days (for total 21 times) after starting of the experiment. In a vehicle control group, 200 μL of a Cremophor EL-ethanol-PBS mixture (3.75:3.75:92.5, v/v/v) was administered to each mouse in the same manner as the treated group. The index of EAE was recorded daily based on visual observation using a severity index system (6-point (0 to 5) scale) from 7 days of the experiment. The symptoms of multiple sclerosis were evaluated based on the following criteria: 0: no abnormality; 1: limp tail; 2: limp tail and hind limb weakness; 3: hind limb paralysis; 4: hind limb paralysis and forelimb weakness; and 5: Moribund. The results of the analysis indicated that, in all the test groups, EAE was developed from 7 days of the experiment, and the severity index at 17 days of the experiment was 3±1.25, indicating that a 100% acute reaction was induced. In the case of the mice of the vehicle control group, the severity index was 3±1 at 17 days of the experiment, 2.5±0.75 at 39 days (chronic reaction period) and 2.33±0.25 at 101 days of the experiment. The vehicle control group showed a relapse-remitting pattern and a high severity index throughout the experiment period. In the Fingolimod-treated group, the severity index was 3±1 at 17 days of the experiment, but was 1.5±0.5 at 39 days of the experiment, indicating that the Fingolimod-treated group showed an alleviated acute reaction and a mild chronic reaction therapeutic effect, compared to the vehicle control group. However, the Fingolimod-treated group showed an increase in the severity index from 39 days of the experiment after completion of administration of the drug and showed a high severity index of 2.7±0.25 at 101 days of the experiment. Also, the group treated with 25 mg/kg of compound 229 of the present invention showed a severity index of 3±1 at 17 days of the experiment, which was similar to that of the vehicle control group, but it showed severity index of 1.25±0.75 at 39 days of the experiment and 1.17±0.75 at 55 days of the experiment, suggesting that a statistically significant therapeutic effect compared to that in the vehicle control group appeared. However, in the group treated with 25 mg/kg of compound 229, the severity index started to increase from 57 days of the experiment and was 1.83±0.5 at 101 days of the experiment, which was lower than that of the vehicle control group, but was slightly higher than that in the initial stage of the experiment (#, p<0.05; ##, p<0.01; and ###, p<0.001, compared to the vehicle control group; see FIG. 5). Moreover, the group treated with 50 mg/kg of compound 229 of the present invention showed a severity index of 3±0.75 at 17 days of the experiment, which was similar to that of the vehicle control group, but it showed severity index of 0.9±0.25 at 39 days of the experiment and 0.63±0.25 at 101 days of the experiment, suggesting that a statistically significant therapeutic effect compared to that in the vehicle control group appeared (*, p<0.05; **, p<0.01; and ***, p<0.001, compared to the vehicle control group; see FIG. 5). In the group treated with 50 mg/kg of compound 229, the therapeutic effect was continuously maintained after oral administration of the compound, and this effect did statistically significant differ from that in the Fingolimod-treated group at 49 days of the experiment (†, p<0.05; †, p<0.01; and †††, p<0.001, compared to the Fingolimod-treated group; see FIG. 5). When compound 229 of the present invention was used at a dose of 25 mg/kg, it showed an excellent therapeutic effect in the initial stage, but showed a slightly insignificant effect on the prevention of relapse, and when compound 229 of the present invention was used at a dose of 50 mg/kg, it showed a therapeutic effect in the initial stage and a continuous effect on the prevention of relapse. Consequently, compound 229 of the present invention has a therapeutic effect against EAE in the murine models, and the therapeutic effect thereof is superior and maintained for a long period of time compared to Fingolimod that is a conventional therapeutic agent against multiple sclerosis. Thus, compound 229 of the present invention is a novel oral therapeutic agent against multiple sclerosis, which can present a more attractive therapeutic strategy. Experimental Example 6 Effect on Apoptosis of Lymphoid Malignancy Cell Lines In order to evaluate the inhibitory effects of compound 457 against lymphoid malignancy cell lines, the following experiment was performed. Each of the acute T cell leukemia cell lines Jurkat, Molt4 and CCRF-CEM, the acute B cell leukemia cell line Raji and the multiple sclerosis cell lines KMS11, KMS12BM, KMS26, KMS28BM, and IM9 was re-suspended in 10% FBS-containing RPMI medium at a concentration of 1.5×105 cells/mL, and 200 μL of each of the cell suspensions was cultured in a flat bottom 96-well plate (Costar). The acute NK cell lymphoma cell line NK-92MI was re-suspended in α-MEM medium (supplemented with 20% FBS, 1×MEM vitamine solution, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol and 1× penicillin/streptomycin) at a concentration of 1.5×105 cells/mL, and 200 μL of the cell suspension was cultured in a flat bottom 96-well plate. The cells in each well was treated with 10 μL of each of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 μM of the compound diluted with RPMI medium, followed by that the cells were incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37° C. for 24 hours. In a vehicle control group, cells were treated with 10 μL of medium containing 0.05% dimetylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma). The cells were collected, and then the apoptosis thereof was analyzed by a flow cytometer after staining with Annexin V-7-AAD. The incubated cells were collected, placed in a 5-mL FACS tube (BD Falcon) and washed with 1 mL of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (1%. FBS and 0.1% sodium azaide in PBS). The cells were re-suspended in 0.1 mL of FACS buffer, followed by that the cells were treated and stained with phycoerythrin-Annexin V at room temperature for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes of staining, the cells were treated and stained with 7-AAD at room temperature for 5 minutes. The stained cells were suspended in 0.3 mL of FACS buffer, and then analyzed by a flow cytometer. As shown in Tables 12 to 15, compounds 065, 108, 229 and 457 of the present invention showed the effects of inducing the apoptosis of various lymphoid malignancy cells. Thus, compounds 065, 108, 229 and 457 of the present invention can be used as a novel anti-lymphoid malignancy drug.

After such administration, mouse death or not, clinical condition and body weight change were monitored. Hematology test and biochemical examination of blood were carried out. After conducting autopsies, abnormality or not of organs in the abdominal and thoracic cavities were observed with the naked eye.
