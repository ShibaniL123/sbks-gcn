Step E: 3-(2-Hydroxypropan-2-yl)-1-(thiophen-3-yl)-1H-indazole-6-carboxylic acid
Methyl 3-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)-1-(thiophen-3-yl)-1H-indazole-6-carboxylate (909.8 mg, 2.88 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (17.25 mL) and methanol (11.50 mL) at 25 °C. 1M sodium hydroxide (11.50 mL, 11.50 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture heated to 50 °C. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 15 min. The reaction was stopped, cooled to room temperature, quenched by addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid (0.950 mL), and concentrated under reduced pressure. The title compound (804.8 mg, 2.66 mmol, 93 % yield) was recovered as a light orange/white solid.
