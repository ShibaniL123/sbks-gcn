FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to the treatment of metabolic disorders, such as, for example, metabolic disorders related to overweight and obesity, such as, for example, Diabetes Mellitus or high cholesterol. The present invention more specifically relates to a composition comprising Akkermansia spp or fragments thereof for treating a metabolic disorder. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Obesity is a worldwide problem, with an estimated number of obese adults of about 250 million. This epidemic of obesity is correlated with a great increase in the prevalence of obesity-related disorders, such as, for example, Diabetes, hypertension, cardiac pathologies and liver diseases. Due to these highly disabling pathologies, obesity is currently considered in western countries as one of the most important public health problem. There is thus a real need of compositions and methods for treating or preventing obesity and/or obesity-related disorders. Obesity and obesity-related diseases are associated with (i) metabolic dysfunctions (with an impact on glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism for example); (ii) low grade inflammatory state associated to higher blood lipopolysaccharides (LPS) levels (also referred as metabolic endotoxemia); and (iii) impaired gut barrier function (i.e. increased gut permeability). In order to treat obesity, impact on at least one, preferably 2 and more preferably 3 of these 3 factors is thus needed. The human gut is colonized by a diverse, complex and dynamic community of microbes representing over 1000 different species, which continuously interact with the host (Zoetendal, Rajilic-Stojanovic and de Vos, Gut 2008, 57: 1605-1615). The homeostasis of the gut microbiota is dependent on host characteristics (age, gender, genetic background . . . ) and environmental conditions (stress, drugs, gastrointestinal surgery, infectious and toxic agents . . . ), but also on the day-to-day dietary changes. Growing evidences support the role of gut microbiota in the development of obesity and related disorders (Delzenne & Cani, Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2011, 31: 15-31). Therefore, treatment with products that target the gut microbiota appeared as promising therapeutic tools for treating obesity and related disorders. These products may consist of living microbes, such as in the case of most probiotics, or contain dead microbes or fragments thereof. In addition, these products may comprise substrates that are used by the gut microbiota, such as in the case of prebiotics, or contain compounds that change the balance of the intestinal microbiota, such as specific antimicrobial compounds. For example, WO 2008/076696 describes the gut microbiota as a therapeutic target for treating obesity and related disorders. WO 2008/076696 specifically describes methods for altering the abundance of Bacteroides and/or Firmicutes in the gut of a subject, by administering antibiotics and/or probiotics to the subject. Moreover, EP 2 030 623 relates to the prevention and/or treatment of metabolic disorders, such as, for example, obesity related disorders, by regulating the amount of Enterobacteria in the gut. EP 2 030 623 discloses reducing the amount of Enterobacteria in the gut by administering probiotic bacteria, such as, for example, Bifidobacterium, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus or Lactobacillus. Furthermore, the Applicant described that the gut microbiota is modified in prebiotic-treated obese mice (Everard et al., Diabetes, 2011 November; 60(11):2775-86). Moreover, prebiotics (1) improve glucose and lipid metabolisms in obese mice, (2) reduce plasma LPS and improve gut barrier function (e.g. reduction of inflammation) in obese mice, (3) induce an increased enteroendocrine L-cell number in obese mice, and (4) improve leptin sensitivity and glucose homeostasy in diet-induced obese and diabetic mice. Among the modification induced by prebiotic treatment of obese mice is a considerable alteration of the gut microbiota composition, characterized by (i) a decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus spp and bacteria of the Bacteroides-Prevotella group; and (ii) an increased abundance of Bifidobacterium spp., of bacteria of the E. rectale/C. coccoides group and of Akkermansia muciniphila, belonging to the Verrucomicrobia. A. muciniphila, a bacteria firstly identified in 2004 by the Applicant, represents approximately 1 to 3% of the total microbiota of healthy adults (Derrien et al, International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, 2004, 54:1469-1476; Derrien et al Applied Environmental Microbiology 2008, 74, 1646-1648.). Indirect evidences suggested a relationship between the abundance of A. muciniphila and intestinal dysfunctions or obesity-related disorders. For example, WO 2011/107481 describes that the absence of Akkermansia muciniphila in the gut of a subject, combined with the presence of Bacteroides capillosus and Clostridium leptum indicates that this subject is suffering from ulcerative colitis. Moreover, Hansen and colleagues showed that the administration of an antibiotic, Vancomycin, to neonatal NOD mice (the NOD mouse model is a model for Diabetes) suppresses clinical onset of Diabetes and propagates Akkermansia muciniphila (Hansen et al., Diabetologia, 2012 August; 55(8):2285-94). However, this may be an indirect effect due to the insensitivity of intestinal Akkermansia spp. to the used antibiotic. These results thus showed that the complete composition of the gut microbiota is modified following the administration of prebiotic in mice. More specifically, no evidence suggested a specific role of one bacterial species, such as, for example, Akkermansia muciniphila, in the beneficial response to prebiotics administration. Moreover, to the Applicant knowledge, no beneficial effect of the direct administration of Akkermansia muciniphila has never been described, nor suggested. Here, the Applicant surprisingly showed that repeated administration of Akkermansia muciniphila alone impacts the three underlying dysfunctions associated with obesity and related disorders, i.e. metabolic dysfunctions, low grade inflammatory state associated to higher blood lipopolysaccharides (LPS) levels and impaired gut barrier function. The present invention thus relates to the use of Akkermansia muciniphila or fragments thereof for treating obesity and related disorders.

EXAMPLES The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples. Materials and Methods Mice Ob/Ob Experiment: ob/ob versus lean study: Six-week-old ob/ob (n=5/group) mice (C57BL/6 background, Jackson-Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me., USA) were housed in a controlled environment (12-h daylight cycle, lights-off at 6-pm) in groups of two or three mice/cage, with free access to food and water. The mice were fed a control diet (A04, Villemoisson-sur-Orge, France) for 16 weeks. Cecal content was harvested immersed in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80° C., for further Akkermansia muciniphila analysis. Ob/Ob Prebiotic Study: Six-week-old ob/ob (n=10/group) mice (C57BL/6 background, Jackson-Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me., USA) were housed in a controlled environment (12-h daylight cycle, lights-off at 6-pm) in groups of two mice/cage, with free access to food and water. The mice were fed a control diet (Ob-CT) (A04, Villemoisson-sur-Orge, France) or a control diet supplemented with prebiotics, such as oligofructose (Ob-Pre) (Orafti, Tienen, Belgium) for 5-weeks as previously described (Everard et al. Diabetes 60, 2775-2786 (2011)). This set of mice has been previously characterized in Everard et al (Everard et al. Diabetes 60, 2775-2786 (2011)). High-Fat Prebiotic Experiment: A set of 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice (40 mice, n=10/group) (Charles River, Brussels, Belgium) were housed in groups of five mice/cage, with free access to food and water. The mice were fed a control diet (CT) (A04, Villemoisson-sur-Orge, France) or a control diet and treated with prebiotics, such as oligofructose (Orafti, Tienen, Belgium) (0.3 g/mouse/day) added in tap water (CT-Pre), or fed a high-fat diet (HF) (60% fat and 20% carbohydrates (kcal/100 g), D12492, Research diet, New Brunswick, N.J., USA) or a HF diet and treated with oligofructose (0.3 g/mouse/day) added in tap water (HF-Pre). Treatment continued for 8 weeks. HFD Akkermansia muciniphila Treatment: A set of 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice (40 mice, n=10/group) (Charles River, Brussels, Belgium) were housed in groups of 2 mice/cage, with free access to food and water. The mice were fed a control diet (CT) (AIN93Mi; Research diet, New Brunswick, N.J., USA) or a high-fat diet (HF) (60% fat and 20% carbohydrates (kcal/100 g), D12492, Research diet, New Brunswick, N.J., USA). Mice were treated with an oral administration of Akkermansia muciniphila by oral gavage at the dose 2·108 cfu/0.2 ml suspended in sterile anaerobic phosphate buffer saline (CT-Akk and HF-Akk) and control groups were treated with an oral gavage of an equivalent volume of sterile anaerobic phosphate buffer saline (CT and HF). Treatment continued for 4 weeks. A. muciniphila MucT (ATTC BAA-835) was grown anaerobically in a mucin-based basal medium as previously described (Derrien et al Int J Syst Evol Microbiol 54, 1469-1476 (2004)) and then washed and suspended in anaerobic phosphate buffer saline, including 25% (v/v) glycerol, to an end concentration of 1·1010 cfu/ml. HFD Akkermansia muciniphila Alive Treatment Vs Heat-Killed and Lactobacillus Platarum WCFS1: A set of 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice (40 mice, n=8/group) (Charles River, Brussels, Belgium) were housed in groups of 2 mice/cage, with free access to food and water. The mice were fed a control diet (CT) (AIN93Mi; Research diet, New Brunswick, N.J., USA) or a high-fat diet (HF) (60% fat and 20% carbohydrates (kcal/100 g), D12492, Research diet, New Brunswick, N.J., USA). Mice were treated daily with an oral administration of Akkermansia muciniphila by oral gavage at the dose 2·108 cfu/0.2 ml suspended in sterile anaerobic phosphate buffer saline A. muciniphila was heat-killed/inactivated by autoclaving (15 min, 121° C., 225 kPa). A viability check by culturing on mucin-containing medium confirmed the absence of any viable cells. Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 was grown anaerobically in MRS medium (Difco Lactobacilli MRS broth; BD), washed, concentrated, and manipulated an identical ways as the A. muciniphila preparation. The two controls group (CT and HF) were treated daily with an oral gavage of an equivalent volume of sterile anaerobic PBS containing a similar end concentration of glycerol (2.5%) (reduced with one drop of 100 mM titanium citrate) as the treatment groups for 4 weeks. Food and water intake were recorded once a week. Body composition was assessed by using 7.5 MHz time domain-nuclear magnetic resonance (TD-NMR) (LF50 minispec, Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). All mouse experiments were approved by and performed in accordance with the guidelines of the local ethics committee. Housing conditions were specified by the Belgian Law of Apr. 6, 2010, regarding the protection of laboratory animals (agreement number LA1230314). Tissue Sampling The animals have been anesthetized with isoflurane (Forene®, Abbott, Queenborough, Kent, England) before exsanguination and tissue sampling, then mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Adipose depots (epididymal, subcutaneous and mesenteric), liver were precisely dissected and weighed; the addition of the three adipose tissues corresponds to the adiposity index. The intestinal segments (ileum, cecum and colon), the cecal content and the adipose tissues were immersed in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80° C., for further analysis. Mucus Layer Thickness Proximal colon segments were immediately removed and fixed in Carnoy's solution (ethanol-acetic acid-chloroform, 6/3/1 v/v/v) for two hours at 4° C. Then the samples were immersed in ethanol 100% for 24 hours prior to processing for paraffin embedding. Paraffin sections of 5 μm were stained with alcian blue. A minimum of 20 different measurements were made perpendicular to the inner mucus layer per field by an investigator blinded to the experimental groups. 5 to 19 randomly selected fields were analyzed for each colon for a total of 2146 measurements by using an image analyzer (Motic-image Plus 2.0ML, Motic, China). RNA Preparation and Real-Time qPCR Analysis Total RNA was prepared from tissues using TriPure reagent (Roche). Quantification and integrity analysis of total RNA was performed by running 1 μl of each sample on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit, Agilent). cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of 1 μg total RNA using a Reverse Transcription System kit (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands). Real-time PCRs were performed with the StepOnePlus™ real-time PCR system and software (Applied Biosystems, Den Ijssel, The Netherlands) using Mesa Fast qPCR™ (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) for detection according to the manufacturer's instructions. RPL19 was chosen as the housekeeping gene. All samples were run in duplicate in a single 96-well reaction plate, and data were analyzed according to the 2−ΔCT method. The identity and purity of the amplified product was checked through analysis of the melting curve carried out at the end of amplification. Primer sequences for the targeted mouse genes are presented in the Table 1 below.

Food was removed two-hours after the onset of the daylight cycle and mice were treated after 6-h-fasting period as previously described (Everard et al. Diabetes 60, 2775-2786 (2011)). Biochemical Analyses Portal vein blood LPS concentration was measured by using Endosafe-MCS (Charles River Laboratories, Lyon, France) based on the Limulus amaebocyte Lysate (LAL) kinetic chromogenic methodology that measures color intensity directly related to the endotoxin concentration in a sample. Serum were diluted 1/10 with endotoxin free buffer to minimize interferences in the reaction (inhibition or enhancement) and heated 15 min at 70° C. Each sample was diluted 1/70 or 1/100 with endotoxin-free LAL reagent water (Charles River Laboratories) and treated in duplicate and two spikes for each sample were included in the determination. All samples have been validated for the recovery and the coefficient variation. The lower limit of detection was 0.005 EU/ml. Plasma insulin concentration was determined in 25 μl of plasma using an ELISA kit (Mercodia, Upssala, Sweden) according to the manufacturer instructions. Fecal IgA levels were determined using an ELISA kit (E99-103, Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, Tex.). Freshly collected feces were frozen at −80° C. then diluted in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.14M NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20. A 1/250 dilution was used to measure IgA by ELISA following the manufacturer instructions. DNA Isolation from Mouse Cecal Samples The cecal content of mice collected post mortem was stored at −80° C. Metagenomic DNA was extracted from the cecal content using a QIAamp-DNA stool mini-kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of Endocannabinoids Intestinal Levels Ileum tissues were homogenised in CHCl3 (10 ml), and deuterated standards were added. The extraction and the calibration curves were generated as previously described (Muccioli et al, Mol Syst Biol, 2010, 6, 392), and the data were normalised by tissue sample weight. qPCR: Primers and Conditions The primers and probes used to detect Akkermansia muciniphila were based on 16S rRNA gene sequences: F-Akkermansia muciniphila CCTTGCGGTTGGCTTCAGAT (SEQ ID NO: 29), R-Akkermansia muciniphila CAGCACGTGAAGGTGGGGAC (SEQ ID NO: 30). Detection was achieved with StepOnePlus™ real-time PCR system and software (Applied Biosystems, Den Ijssel, The Netherlands) using Mesa Fast qPCR™ (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's instructions Each assay was performed in duplicate in the same run. The cycle threshold of each sample was then compared to a standard curve (performed in triplicate) made by diluting genomic DNA (five-fold serial dilution) (DSMZ, Braunshweig, Germany). The data are expressed as Log of bacteria/g of cecal content. MITChip: PCR Primers and Conditions DNA extracted from cecal contents was analyzed using the Mouse Intestinal Tract Chip (MITChip), a phylogenetic microarray consisting of 3,580 different oligonucleotides probes targeting two hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene (V1 and V6 regions). Analysis of the MITChip were performed as previously described (Everard et al. Diabetes 60, 2775-2786 (2011); Geurts et al. Front Microbiol. 2, 149 (2011)). Briefly, Microbiota analysis was carried out on level 2 corresponding to genus-like level. Multivariate analysis was performed by representational difference analysis (RDA) as implemented in the CANOCO 4.5 software package (Biometris, Wageningen, The Netherlands) on average signal intensities for 99 bacterial groups (levels 2). All environmental variables were transformed as log (1+X). A Monte-Carlo permutation test based on 999 random permutations was used to test the significance. P values<0.05 were considered significant. Measurement of Plasma Cholesterol Plasma samples were assayed for cholesterol by measuring cholesterol present after enzymatic hydrolysis of ester cholesterol, using a commercial kit (DiaSys, Condom, France). Statistical Analysis Data are expressed as means±s.e.m. Differences between two groups were assessed using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test. Data sets involving more than two groups were assessed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc tests. Correlations were analyzed using Pearson's correlation. Data with different superscript letters are significantly different P<0.05, according to the post-hoc ANOVA statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif., USA). Results were considered statistically significant when P<0.05. Results We found that abundance of A. muciniphila was 3300-fold lower in leptin-deficient obese mice versus their lean littermates (FIG. 1a). Consistently, we found a 100-fold decrease in high-fat (HF)-fed mice (FIG. 1c). In both models, prebiotics completely restore A. muciniphila count (FIG. 1b,c). In HF-fed mice, prebiotics abolished metabolic endotoxemia (FIG. 1d), normalized adipose tissue CD11c subpopulation of macrophages (FIG. 1e) and lowered fat mass (FIG. 1g and FIG. 3b). These results were significantly and inversely correlated with A. muciniphila (FIG. 1f and FIG. 3a,c). Nevertheless, it remained to demonstrate whether molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of these disorders rely on the lack of A. muciniphila and in contrast if the improvement after prebiotic treatment results from its higher abundance. To address this question, A. muciniphila was orally administered to control or HF-fed mice during four weeks, thereby increasing A. muciniphila (FIG. 4a,b). By using a phylogenetic-microarray (MITChip) (Everard et al. Diabetes 60, 2775-2786 (2011); Geurts et al. Front Microbiol. 2, 149 (2011)), we found that both HF-diet and A. muciniphila colonization significantly affected the complex relationship among bacteria within the gut microbiota composition, as shown by principal component analyses (PCA) (FIG. 2a) and supported by relative changes of different taxa. We found that A. muciniphila treatment normalized diet-induced metabolic endotoxemia, adiposity and adipose tissue CD11c marker (FIG. 2b,c,e and FIG. 5a), without any changes in food intake (FIG. 5b). Moreover, A. muciniphila treatment reduced body weight and improved body composition (i.e. fat mass/lean mass ratio) (FIGS. 5c and 5d). Accordingly, we hypothesized that A. muciniphila would impact on adipose tissue metabolism, and found that under HF-diet, A. muciniphila increased mRNA expression of markers of adipocyte differentiation and lipid oxidation without affecting lipogenesis (FIG. 2f). Together, these data further suggest that A. muciniphila controls fat storage and adipose tissue metabolism. We next discovered that colonization with A. muciniphila completely reversed diet-induced fasting hyperglycemia, by a mechanism associated with a 40% reduction of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase expression (FIG. 6a,b), thereby suggesting reduced gluconeogenesis. Notably, the insulin-resistance index was similarly reduced after treatment (FIG. 2d). Collectively, these results suggest that A. muciniphila contributes to regulation of adipose tissue metabolism and glucose homeostasis. One explanation would be that A. muciniphila plays key roles at different levels of the regulation of gut barrier function. Recent data suggest that intestinal cells also contribute to the maintenance of gut barrier by secreting antimicrobial peptides thereby shaping microbial communities (Pott et al, EMBO Rep (2012)). To further elucidate how A. muciniphila colonization affects gut barrier function; we measured the expression of Paneth and epithelial cells antibacterial markers in the ileum. We found that A. muciniphila increased Reg3g (regenerating islet-derived 3-gamma, RegIIIγ) expression under control diet, whereas this effect was not observed in HF-fed mice (FIG. 7a). Pla2g2a, Defa expression were similar between groups, whereas Lyz1 expression tends to be lower after bacteria administration (FIG. 7b,c,d). IgA are secreted in intestinal lumen and are known to restrict mucosal bacterial penetration (Vaishnava, S., et al. Science 334, 255-258 (2011)), here we found that fecal IgA levels were not affected by the treatments (FIG. 7e). Thereby, suggesting that A. muciniphila controls gut barrier function by other mechanisms involving its epithelial signalling (Derrien et al. Front Microbiol 2, 166 (2011)). We may not rule out that the endocannabinoid system plays a crucial role in this context; since we found that A. muciniphila treatment increased 2-oleoylglycerol, 2-palmitoylglycerol and 2-arachidonoylglycerol intestinal levels (FIG. 2g). Importantly, 2-oleoylglycerol has been shown to stimulate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) release from intestinal L-cells suggesting that both GLP-1 and GLP-2 might improve gut barrier and glucose homeostasis in this context (Hansen, et al. J Clin Endocrinol Metab 96, E1409-1417 (2011)). Moreover, 2-arachidonoylglycerol reduces gut permeability and 2-palmitoylglycerol (Alhouayek et al FASEB J 25, 2711-2721 (2011); Ben-Shabat, et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 353, 23-31 (1998)) potentiates 2-arachidonoylglycerol anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, it is likely that the increased levels of these three endocannabinoids observed after A. muciniphila colonization constitutes a molecular event linking these metabolic features. Recent evidences support that interactions between gut microbiota and mucus layer are dynamic systems affecting the biology of mucus barrier (Belzer et al, ISME J 6, 1449-1458 (2012); Johansson et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 108 Suppl 1, 4659-4665 (2011)). Thus we investigated the impact of A. muciniphila colonization on the inner mucus layer thickness. Remarkably, we found a 46% thinner mucus layer in HF-fed mice (FIG. 2h), whereas A. muciniphila colonization counteracts this decrease (FIG. 2h). Together these novel findings support the idea that the presence of A. muciniphila within mucus layer is a crucial mechanism to control mucus turnover (Belzer et al, ISME J 6, 1449-1458 (2012)). We next examined whether A. muciniphila also affects Reg3g expression in the colon epithelial cells. Strikingly, Reg3g expression was reduced by about 50% under HF-diet. A. muciniphila completely blunted this effect and even more increased Reg3g expression by 400% as compared to HF-fed mice (FIG. 2i). Thus this links the colonization of the colon, but not ileum, by A. muciniphila with the fundamental immune mechanism by which RegIIIγ promotes host-bacterial mutualism and regulates the spatial relationships between microbiota and host (Vaishnava, S., et al. Science 334, 255-258 (2011)). It is important to note that in germ-free mice A. muciniphila induces gene expression in the colon rather than the ileum (Derrien et al. Front Microbiol 2, 166 (2011)). To further demonstrate whether A. muciniphila has to be alive to exert its metabolic effects, we have compared the impact of viable A. muciniphila administration (2·108 bacterial cells suspended in 200 μl of sterile anaerobic phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) to heat-killed/inactivated A. muciniphila (autoclaving, 15 minutes, 121° C., 225 kPa). We found that viable and metabolically active A. muciniphila counteracted diet-induced metabolic endotoxemia, fat mass development and altered adipose tissue metabolism (FIG. 8A, B, D and FIG. 9A) to a similar extent as observed in the first set of experiments. Importantly, these effects were not observed following the administration of heat-inactivated A. muciniphila (FIG. 8A, B, D and FIG. 9A). In addition, we found that metabolically active A. muciniphila significantly reduced plasma glucose levels following an oral glucose tolerance test (FIG. 8C), whereas heat-inactivated A. muciniphila exhibited similar glucose intolerance than HF-fed mice (FIG. 8C). Finally, we confirmed that metabolically active A. muciniphila restored mucus layer thickness upon HF-diet whereas we found that heat-inactivated A. muciniphila did not improve mucus layer thickness as compared to HF (FIGS. 8E and F). It is worth noting that we found 100-fold more metabolically active A. muciniphila recovered from the cecal and colonic content of A. muciniphila treated mice as compared to HF and heat-inactivated bacteria group (HF-Akk: 9.5+/−1.02 Log10 cells/mg of content, HF and HF-K-Akk: 6.8+/−0.51 Log10 cells/mg of content, P=0.0059), thereby evidencing the viability of A. muciniphila after oral administration. These results thus confirm that that HF diet-induced obesity is associated with changes in gut microbiota composition, however, antimicrobial peptides in the ileum were not affected by the treatments. In contrast, Reg3g expression in colon epithelial cells was significantly reduced by approximately 50% in HF and heat-inactivated A. muciniphila treated mice, whereas metabolically active A. muciniphila treatment completely blunted this effect and increased Reg3g expression upon HF diet (FIG. 9B). We then wanted to test if A. muciniphila administration was still efficient during a prolonged high-fat diet treatment (8 weeks) and if the administration of A. muciniphila 3 times a week (instead of daily) was sufficient to protect against diet-induced obesity. The preparations as well as the doses of A. muciniphila were similar to those presented in the protocol using daily oral gavage or metabolically inactivated A. muciniphila. We found that A. muciniphila treatment reduces body weight gain (FIG. 10A) by about 30% although mice were ingesting high-fat diet without any fat lost in their feces and changes in food intake behavior. This was also associated with a reduction of about 45% of the adipose tissue weight (subcutaneous adipose tissue) (FIG. 10B) and 35% decrease in visceral fat depots (mesenteric and epididymal) (FIG. 10C). Thus, this set of data support the fact that A. muciniphila administration remains efficient during a prolonged treatment and the treatment is still efficient if A. muciniphila is administered 3 times per week instead of daily. In order to confirm that these results were specific of A. muciniphila, we then treated HF-fed mice with a probiotic (i.e. Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1). We found that L. plantarum administration did not change fat mass development, adipose tissue metabolism, mucus layer thickness, colon Reg3g mRNA, and metabolic endotoxemia (FIG. 12A-E). Hypercholesterolemia is known as a key factor involved in cardiovascular diseases. We therefore tested the effect of A. muciniphila administration on plasma cholesterol of mice fed a high-fat diet. As shown in FIG. 11, A. muciniphila treatment significantly decreases (about 15%) plasma cholesterol, thereby contributing with LPS and the other metabolic parameters to an improved cardio-metabolic risk profile. In summary, our findings not only provide substantial insights into the intricate mechanisms by which A. muciniphila regulates the crosstalk between the host and the gut microbiota, but also provide a rationale for considering the development of a treatment using this human mucus-colonizer for the prevention or the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic disorders such as, for example, hypercholesterolemia. 1-17.
