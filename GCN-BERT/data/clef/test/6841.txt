The present invention relates to the technical field of electrical household appliances for food preparation, comprising a working body with a food insertion device, said working body housing a working tool for processing the inserted food. The present invention relates in particular, but not exclusively, to electrical household appliances for food preparation comprising a working body with an outlet for processed food, which allows continuous operation. The present invention relates in particular to appliances for pressing, grating, mincing, slicing, and grinding foods such as presses, juicers, vegetable cutters, graters, grinders, and multifunctional robots. Document DE102010026974 discloses an appliance for food preparation comprising a working tool positioned in a working body comprising a cover with several spouts for inserting food into the working body. The spouts have different cross-sections and heights. These arrangements make it possible to provide several options for the insertion of food into the working body. However, these arrangements are adapted more for elongate food items of a height greater than the cross-section of the spout. An object of the present invention is to facilitate the insertion of small-sized food items into the working body of an electrical household appliance for food preparation. Another object of the present invention is to improve the rate at which food is inserted into the working body of an electrical household appliance for food preparation. These objects are achieved with an electrical household appliance for food preparation comprising a working body having a cover and a working tool positioned in the working body, the cover having at least two spouts for inserting food into the working body, wherein the cover comprises an upper collector leading into at least two of the spouts. The cross-section of the spouts of electrical household appliances for food preparation is limited for reasons related to standards. The use of several spouts makes it possible to increase the rate at which food is inserted into the working body. The use of an upper collector according to the invention facilitates the distribution of food into the various spouts, in particular for food pieces or small-sized food items. The upper collector advantageously has at least one upper edge portion for containing food. As a supplement or an alternative, the upper collector can have a surface slanted towards the spouts. According to an advantageous embodiment, the upper collector has an annular upper rim. The annular upper rim thus surrounds the upper inlet of the spouts. According to an advantageous embodiment, the upper collector has several openings, each opening leading into one of the spouts. As an alternative, the upper collector could in particular have at least one opening leading into at least two of the spouts. According to a preferred embodiment, the cover has at least three spouts arranged about a rotational axis of the working tool. The center part of the cover is of less importance for the insertion of food because the linear velocity of the working tool is less there than at the periphery. Preference is given to the cover having between three and six spouts arranged about a rotational axis of the working tool. Advantageously then, the cover comprises a guide element for receiving an upper end of the working tool centered along the rotational axis, said guide element being surrounded by the spouts. This arrangement makes it possible to obtain a functional appliance without affecting the supplying of the working body. According to an advantageous embodiment, the appliance comprises a plunger for pushing the food into each of the spouts. The same plunger can thus be used successively with the different spouts. The spouts then preferably have identical inside cross-sections. The spouts advantageously have a non-circular inside cross-section. This arrangement makes it possible to prevent the plunger from rotating in the spout. According to an advantageous embodiment, the spouts are formed in a common piece. This arrangement helps reinforce the sturdiness of the cover. According to an advantageous embodiment, the upper collector is mounted on the spouts. In other words, the upper collector and the spouts are formed from different pieces. This arrangement simplifies the manufacturing of the cover. The upper collector can optionally be detachable from the spouts, or on the other hand it can be fastened to the spouts. According to an advantageous embodiment, the working body is positioned on a motorized housing with a drive output for driving the working tool positioned in the working body in rotation. This arrangement makes it possible to free up the surface of the cover. According to a remarkable embodiment, the working tool forms a rotatably driven pressing screw and the working body comprises a filter element delimiting a first compartment housing the pressing screw and a second compartment for collecting at least a portion of the food processed by the pressing screw. In particular, it is possible to extract juice from small fruits or fruit pieces after the cores have been removed. The insertion of such food into the appliance can be tedious, and the upper collector therefore makes it possible to use a significant quantity of food by introducing it gradually into the working body at the desired pace. Advantageously then, the pressing screw is surrounded by the filter element. This arrangement makes it easier to obtain a high flow rate of the pressed food. According to a preferred embodiment, the pressing screw has two main threads defining two separate passages for the food inserted into the working body via the spouts. This arrangement enables the forces to be more evenly distributed around the pressing screw and likewise helps in obtaining a high flow rate of the pressed food. Advantageously still, the working body comprises at least one outlet for discharging at least a portion of the food processed by the working tool. The working body can optionally comprise a first outlet for the juice and a second outlet for the pressing residue. Another object of the present invention is to propose an electrical household appliance for food preparation comprising a working body housing a pressing screw, wherein the motorization is adapted for improving the rate at which the food is inserted into the working body. This object is achieved with an electrical household appliance for food preparation comprising a working body positioned on a motorized housing with a drive output for driving the working tool positioned in the working body in rotation, the working tool forming a rotatably driven pressing screw and the working body comprising a filter element delimiting a first compartment housing the pressing screw and a second compartment for collecting at least a portion of the food processed by the pressing screw, the motorized housing holding an electric motor connected to the drive output by means of a transmission device, wherein the transmission device comprises a two-stage epicyclic reducer having a first stage driven by the electric motor, a second stage driven by the first stage, the second stage driving the drive output. With this arrangement, it is possible to obtain a screw press-type electrical household appliance for food preparation comprising a sturdy and compact reducer. According to a preferred embodiment, the first stage has at least one first pinion cooperating with a first drive axis mounted on an output shaft of the electric motor on the one hand and with a first toothed inner wall of a first housing element on the other, the first pinion being mounted so that it can rotate freely on a first rotary support having a first output axis coaxial with the output shaft of the electric motor, wherein the second stage comprises at least one second pinion cooperating with a second drive axis mounted on the first output axis on the one hand and with a second toothed inner wall of a second housing element on the other, the second pinion being mounted so that it can rotate freely on a second rotary support having a second output axis coaxial with the first output axis, the second output axis forming the drive output. The working chamber can optionally have a cover with at least one spout for inserting food into the working body. The working body preferably has a cover with at least two spouts for inserting food into the working body.

The two main threads 22 define two separate passages 24 for the food inserted into the working body via the spouts 11, 12, 13. Secondary threads 26 can be interposed between the main threads 22. The upper portion of each main thread 22 forms a bearing surface 27 for bearing the food inserted via one of the spouts 11, 12, 13 prior to the cutting of said food by the adjacent upper cutting end 23. As can be discerned in FIG. 6, the bearing surfaces 27 are arranged facing the conduits formed by the spouts 11, 12, 13. More particularly in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 10, the working body comprises a filter element 40 delimiting a first compartment 41 housing the pressing screw 21 and a second compartment 42 for collecting at least a portion of the food processed by the pressing screw 21. The pressing screw 21 driven in rotation in the working body 1 presses the food against the filter element 40 in order to extract the juice, which can then flow into the second compartment 42. In the preferred embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 10, the pressing screw 21 is surrounded by the filter element 40. The working body 1 advantageously comprises at least one outlet 31, 32 for discharging at least a portion of the food processed by the working tool 20. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 10, the outlet 31 communicates with the second compartment 42 for discharging the juice; the other outlet 32 communicates with the first compartment 41 for discharging the residue. According to a feature of the invention, the cover 10 comprises an upper collector 50 leading into at least two of the spouts 11, 12, 13. In other words, the upper collector 50 forms a food collection device that is common to at least two spouts. The user can thus put food and/or food pieces on the upper collector 50 without necessarily choosing the spout or spouts used to insert the food into the working body 1. The upper collector 50 preferably leads into all of the spouts 11, 12, 13. As is more readily visible in FIG. 9, the upper collector 50 has several openings 51, 52, 53 and each opening 51, 52, 53 leads into one of the spouts 11, 12, 13. As an alternative, the upper collector could have at least one opening common to several spouts. According to a preferred embodiment, the cover 10 has at least three spouts 11, 12, 13 arranged about a rotational axis 28 of the working tool 20. As can be seen in FIG. 8, the cover 10 comprises a guide element 15 for receiving an upper end 29 of the working tool 20 centered along the rotational axis 28. As is more readily visible in FIG. 10, said guide element 15 is surrounded by the spouts 11, 12, 13. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 10, the spouts 11, 12, 13 are arranged symmetrically about the rotational axis 28 of the working tool 20. The spouts 11, 12, 13 extend parallel to the rotational axis 28 of the working tool 20, as can be discerned in FIG. 8.

The user can then insert food in one or another of the spouts 11, 12, 13, and/or place food on the stage 55 of the upper collector 50 for inserting it gradually into the spouts 11, 12, 13. The user is thus able to obtain a rate of insertion of food into the working chamber 1 that is suitably adapted to the rate at which the working tool 20 processes the food. The upper collector is, for example, well-suited to the use of small-sized food items or food pieces that are not handled individually. As an alternative, the upper collector 50 can have at least three openings arranged around a guide element 15 for the upper end 29 of the rotational axis 28 of the working tool 20. As an alternative, the cover 10 can comprise at least one cutting blade arranged in one of the spouts 11, 12, 13, and/or at least one cutting blade arranged between two spouts. The cover 10 illustrated in FIGS. 12 and 13 differs from the cover 10 illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 6 and in FIGS. 8 through 10 in that it comprises two spouts 11, 12. The upper collector 50 leads into the two spouts 11, 12. Hence each opening 51, 52 leads into one of the spouts 11, 12. In addition, the two spouts 11, 12 are arranged on either side of the axis of the cover 10 that corresponds to the rotational axis of the working tool.
