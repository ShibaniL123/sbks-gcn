13.4: 5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-isopropyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (compound 13)
112 mg (0.5 mmol) of 3-piperidin-4-yl-3,4-dihydro-1H-quinazolin-2-one (prepared as described in example 1.5) and 0.1 ml (0.5 mmol) of triethylamine are added to a solution, previously stirred for 5 minutes, containing 150 mg (0.4 mmol) of [5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-isopropyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid, 70 mg (0.5 mmol) of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and 101.3 mg (0.5 mmol) of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride in 6 ml of dimethylformamide. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 14 hours. The reaction mixture is hydrolysed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate and then diluted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed once with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate, once with water and once with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulphate and then filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude residue is purified by silica gel chromatography eluted with a dichloromethane/methanol 95/5 mixture, then recrystallized from ethyl acetate. 39 mg (16%) of 5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-isopropyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of an off-white solid.
