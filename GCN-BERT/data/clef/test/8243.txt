Step 2: Synthesis of methyl 4-bromo-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate
To a suspended solution of sodium hydride (60%, 33.7 g, 2 eq) in DMF (300 ml) was dropwised with methyl 2-(methylsulfonyl)propanoate (70 g, 1 eq) in DMF (100 ml) at 0Â° C. and stirred for 30 min. After then, the mixture was added with 1,2-dibromoethane (158 g, 2 eq) and stirred for 6 hr at room temperature. The mixture was quenched with sat. aq. NH4Cl, extracted with ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (225 mg, 43%).
