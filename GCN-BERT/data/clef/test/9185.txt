FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the field of supporting, anchoring and/or securing devices, and, more particularly, to tie supporting, anchoring and/or securing apparatuses or devices, including tie positioning devices, providing support to a tie, operating to keep a tie in position and/or preventing loosening, shifting, moving etc. of the tie from a predetermined or rest position and methods of using same. Such tie anchoring and/or securing devices provide consistency and reliability to tie placement while a user of the tie wears, installs and/or removes same, particularly where the tie(s) would shift, loosen, move, etc. without use of the one or more tie anchoring and/or securing apparatuses. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The tie, and especially a knot tie (also referred to here as a “necktie”; various types of knots may be used, such as, but not limited to, the four-in-hand knot, the Windsor knot, half-Windsor knot, the Pratt or Shelby knot, etc.) having a thinner or short (back) end and a thicker or longer (front) end, a bow tie, a Bolo tie, a cravat or neckband, ascot or other type(s) of ties having material (such as cloth) worn around the neck of a user (e.g., for decorative purposes), has been a garment(s) worn by many persons for hundreds of years or longer. The necktie and bow ties are particularly popular types of ties worn by many users, especially as such ties often form a part of regular office, work or formal wear. Typically, such ties are worn without any type of support or securing assistance beyond that which the ties provide due to their structural attributes. Typically, ties are worn for a particular fashion look and/or feel, and often times provide various types of decorations, designs, appliqués, etc. thereon. As such, users often prefer that ties do not shift, loosen, move or otherwise become out of place after the initial placement of such ties. Unfortunately, constant problems users encounter with ties of various types is that such ties often loosen, shift, move, swing or otherwise become out of place from the original, predetermined, rest position in which the user places the tie for wearing. When one or more of these problems occur, the user may appear disheveled, unkempt, anti-symmetrical (and therefore lack uniformity in appearance), and messy. While tie clips have been developed over the years, such tie clips are deficient because they fail to prevent the tie from loosening while also keeping the tie in place. Thus, it would therefore be desirable to provide one or more apparatuses or devices that provide support to a tie, operate to keep a tie in position and/or prevent loosening, shifting, moving etc. of the tie from a predetermined or rest position and one or more methods of using same. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with one or more embodiments of the present invention, tie supporting, anchoring and/or securing apparatuses or devices for providing support to a tie, operating to keep a tie in position and/or preventing the loosening, shifting, moving etc. of the tie from a predetermined or rest position, and methods of using the tie supporting, anchoring and/or securing apparatuses or devices are provided. The one or more tie supporting, anchoring and/or securing apparatuses or devices may be placed on one or more types of ties (see e.g., several types of ties discussed above) after a predetermined type of tie is in position. While various types of tie supporting, anchoring and/or securing apparatuses or devices are disclosed herein, preferably a user selects one of the tie supporting, anchoring and/or securing apparatuses or devices for use with a particular, predetermined type of tie. That said, the tie supporting, anchoring and/or securing apparatuses or devices may be interchangeable for the one or more types of ties as discussed herein. Preferably, the selected apparatus or device is disposed on a first side (e.g., a backside where, in at least one embodiment, the front side of a tie may be one or more sides of the tie facing away from the user and the backside of the tie may be one or more sides of the tie facing towards the user and/or located between the user and the front side of the tie) portion of a tie knot (or other predetermined tie location) and prevents the knot (or other tie portion) from slipping downwards or from otherwise coming undone. The apparatus or device may be disposed in a back, middle (e.g., between both cloth portions (e.g., the thinner or short (or back) end and the thicker or longer (front) end) of the tie) or front portion of a tie. Preferably, tie movement is prevented using a “U” or “V” shaped or substantially “U” or “V” shaped buttress element, which is disposed on the tie such that one or more portions of the knot or tie rest in the buttress element.

The apparatus or device 10 may be disposed in a back portion, a middle portion (e.g., between both cloth portions (e.g., the thinner or short (or back) end (see e.g., the portion 3 of the tie 2) and the thicker or longer (front) end (see e.g., the thicker portion of the tie 2 as shown in FIG. 1A) of the tie 2)) and/or a front portion of the tie 2 (or combinations of those portions of the tie 2). The apparatus or device 10 may include metal, plastic or other material (see further discussion below) that provides the structural attributes discussed herein. Preferably, the body or flex frame 11 is sized and shaped to operate to receive and hold therein at least a section of the portion 3 of the tie 2 and/or the portion of the tie 2. Preferably, the body or flex frame 11 is substantially O or 0 shaped, thereby defining a hole or a zone of space in communication with the body or flex frame 11, such that any portion of the tie 2 disposed therein is encompassed by the body or flex frame 11. In one embodiment, the body or flex frame 11 may include a clip (e.g., which may be U, V, C, (or ) shaped or substantially U, V, C, (or ) shaped) or other component having a spring or spring-like bias, such as, but not limited to, the first portion 12 and the second portion 13 of the body or flex frame 11 connected to each other at respective ends thereof (see FIGS. 1A-1D). Preferably, the first portion 12 and the second portion 13 are springingly biased towards each other, and the body or flex frame 11 may be opened by the user 1 by applying force to the body or flex frame 11 (preferably at the ends (e.g., end portions 12c, 12d, 13c, 13d as discussed below; where one or more hinges are located on the ends of the portions 12, 13; etc.) of the portions 12, 13 of the flex frame 11 (see the user 1 applying such force to the flex frame 11 by pinching same in FIG. 1B). When the force is removed from the body or flex frame 11, the body or flex frame 11 (and/or portions thereof, such as the first and second portions 12, 13) operates to return to its original, at-rest position, orientation and/or configuration, thereby having a resilient elasticity. The force may be minimal and/or of a predetermined, pre-selected amount based on the needs of the user 1 and the structure of the apparatus or device 10. As such, the amount of force may be modified from one embodiment of the apparatus or device 10 to the next embodiment (see e.g., the other apparatuses or devices 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, etc. as discussed herein below) depending on the needs of the user 1. The springing bias of the first and second portions 12 and 13 of the flex frame 11 may be provided and/or increased by the size and shape of the first and second portions 12, 13. For example, in at least one embodiment, the first and second portions 12, 13 may be U, V, C, (or ) shaped or substantially U, V, C, (or ) shaped, and positioned, and connected to each other, such that the first and second portion combination is at least one of ] [shaped, > < shaped and/or ) (shaped (e.g., the shape of each of the first and second portions 12, 13 are such that the first and second portions 12, 13 operate to bow or spring towards each other). Preferably, when the body or flex frame 11 is in its original, at-rest position, orientation and/or configuration, the body or flex frame 11 operates, and, therefore, the first and second portions 12, 13 of the flex frame 11 operate, to grip and hold the tie 2 (and/or a portion thereof) in the preselected, predetermined position, orientation and/or configuration (see e.g., FIGS. 1A and 1D). As best shown in FIGS. 1B-1C, the first and second portions 12, 13 are preferably oriented and connected to each other such that each has respective first or inside surfaces 12b, 13b (e.g., the first or inside surfaces 12b, 13b substantially face each other; may define a zone of space therebetween; etc.) and second or outside surfaces 12a, 13a (e.g., the second or outside surfaces 12a, 13a substantially face away from each other; may define a perimeter of the body or flex frame 11; etc.), and the first and second portions 12, 13 extend along, substantially parallel to, and/or parallel to a longitudinal axis, L, extending through the apparatus or device 10 (see FIG. 1C). As such, when the body or flex frame 11 is in its original, at-rest position, orientation and/or configuration (and especially when the tie 2 is not disposed therein), the surfaces 12a, 12b, 13a, 13b (and/or at least sections thereof) may be parallel or substantially parallel to each other. The body or flex frame 11 may include one or more elevations and depressions (e.g., one or more protrusions, one or more hooks, one or more convex contours and/or one or more concave contours, etc.; preferably located on one or both of the first or inside surfaces 12b, 13b but may be located on one or both of the second or outside surfaces 12a, 13a alternatively or additionally) to better grip the tie 2. Preferably, the first and second portions 12, 13 have the same width, height and length. In one or more embodiments, at least one of the width, height and length of the first and second portions 12, 13 may be different. Preferably, the first and second portions 12, 13 are built into, made integral with, and/or permanently connected to each other. That said, as discussed further below, the first and second portions 12, 13 may be releasably connected via one or more releasable connection means, such as, but not limited to, hinges, pin-receptacle combinations, latches, etc. As best seen in FIGS. 1A and 1D, the buttress element 14 operates to prevent movement of the tie 2 and/or to prevent the knot 4 from loosening, and one or more portions of the knot 4 and/or the tie 2 may rest in the buttress element 14. Preferably, the one or more portions of the knot 4 and/or the tie 2 are disposed in the zone of space located between the first and second portions 14a, 14b of the buttress element 14. The buttress element 14 is preferably U or V shaped or substantially U or V shaped (e.g., the first and second portions 14a, 14b are connected to each other and oriented such that the first and second portions 14a, 14b define and form the U or V shape or substantial U or V shape). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the structure and orientation of the first and second portions 14a, 14b with respect to each other may be modified in various ways while providing the same benefits described herein. Preferably, the buttress element 14 is connected to the body or flex frame 11, and extends from the body or flex frame 11 along an axis that is a different axis than the longitudinal axis, L, of the body or flex frame 11. Preferably, the buttress element 14 is perpendicular, transverse, substantially perpendicular and/or substantially transverse to the body or flex frame 11. Alternatively, the buttress element 14 may extend from the body or flex frame 11 at any other predetermined, preselected angle (e.g., 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 30 degrees, in the range of 20-85 degrees, in the range of 0-85 degrees, etc.). Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the structure and orientation of the body or flex frame 11 and the buttress element 14 with respect to each other may be modified in various ways while providing the same benefits described herein. The buttress element 14 may include one or more elevations and depressions (e.g., one or more protrusions, one or more hooks, one or more convex contours and/or one or more concave contours, etc.) to better grip the tie 2. As best seen in FIGS. 1B-1C, the first portion 14a of the buttress element may include a curved portion such that the first portion 14a extends from the second portion 14b a predetermined distance and then curves such that the remaining section of the first portion 14a is parallel or substantially parallel to the second portion 14b of the buttress element 14. Preferably, the buttress element 14 is built into, made integral with, and/or permanently connected to the body or flex frame 11. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the buttress element 14 may be connected to the body or flex frame 11 using any methods known to those skilled in the art, such as, but not limited to, gluing, welding, press-fitting, riveting, bonding, fusing, adhering, molding, clamping, screwing, latching, friction-fitting, etc. Additionally or alternatively, in one or more embodiments (see e.g., FIGS. 3A and 3B and discussion below), the buttress element 14 may be releasably connectable to the body or flex frame 11 so that the buttress element 14 and the body or flex frame 11 may be connected for use and then disconnected after use, during manufacturing, for storage, shipment, and/or for any other suitable scenario. For example, the buttress element 14 may include a clip or clasp 19 (best seen in FIGS. 3A-3B) or other connecting means connected to, and extending from, the base of the buttress element 14 (e.g., the base of the second portion 14b of the buttress element 14), the clip or other connecting means operating to releasably connect the buttress element 14 to the body or flex frame 11. In one or more other embodiments, one or more clips or clasps 19 may be connected to the base of the second portion 14b and/or the first portion 14a of the buttress element 14. Preferably, the first and second portions 14a, 14b have the same width, height and length. In one or more embodiments, at least one of the width, height and length of the first and second portions 14a, 14b may be different. The other embodiments of the tie securing, anchoring and/or supporting apparatuses or devices 20, 30, 40, 80, etc. as discussed herein may include the same or similar elements as those included in the apparatus or device 10 discussed above. Indeed, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the elements (e.g., the body or flex frame 11; the first and second portions 12, 13 of the body or flex frame 11; the first and second surfaces 12a, 12b, 13a, 13b of the first and second portions of the body or flex frame 11; the first ends 12d, 13d of the first and second portions 12, 13 of the body or flex frame 11; the second ends 12c, 13c of the first and second portions 12, 13 of the body or flex frame 11; the buttress element 14; the first and second portions 14a, 14b of the buttress element 14; the longitudinal axis, L, of the body or flex frame 11; the hinge 15 of the body or flex frame 11; the pin 18 and receptacles 16, 17a, 17b of the body or flex frame 11; the clip or clasp 19 of the buttress element 14; the cinch mechanisms 31, etc.) of the apparatuses or devices 20, 30, 40, 80, etc. or any other tie securing, anchoring or supporting apparatuses or devices discussed herein may operate in the same or similar fashion to those like-numbered elements of the apparatus or device 10 as discussed above or any additional like-numbered elements discussed further herein below. For example, FIGS. 4A-8 as discussed further below may also show one or more of the same or similar like-numbered elements as already discussed above for the apparatus or device 10. Indeed, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the aforementioned discussions and teachings regarding such elements apply to the additional embodiments, such as, but not limited to the apparatuses or devices 20, 30, 40, 80, etc. as discussed further below. As such, the subject teachings regarding the like-numbered elements are not repeated herein below. As aforementioned, the first and second portions 12, 13 may be releasably connected via one or more releasable connection means, such as, but not limited to, one or more hinges, one or more pin-receptacle combinations, one or more latches, one or more latch-catch combinations, etc. As best seen in FIGS. 2A-2B, in an alternative embodiment of the tie securing, anchoring and/or supporting device or apparatus 10, the first and second portions 12, 13 may be connected at first respective ends 12d, 13d thereof by a hinge 15 of the body or flex frame 11, and may be releasably connected/disconnected from each other at the second respective ends 12c, 13c thereof by a pin-receptacle combination. For example, the second portion 13 of the body or flex frame 11 may include one or more receptacles 17a, 17b, and the first portion 12 of the body or flex frame 11 may include a receptacle 16 such that, when all of the receptacles 16, 17a, 17b are aligned (e.g., the receptacle 16 is located between the receptacles 17a, 17b such that the holes therein are aligned; the holes of the receptacles 16, 17a, 17b are co-linear; etc.), a pin 18 may be disposed in the receptacles 16, 17a, 17b and through the holes thereof to releasably connect the second ends 12c, 13c of the first and second portions 12, 13 together (as best seen in FIG. 2B). When the user 1 desires to disconnect the second ends 12c, 13c (as best seen in FIG. 2A), the user 1 may remove the pin 18 from the receptacles 16, 17a, 17b. Preferably, the pin 18 mates with the receptacles 16, 17a, 17b to prevent piercing/injury to the user 1. While FIG. 2A shows the pin 18 entering the receptacles 16, 17a, 17b in the direction of the shown arrow (by first entering the receptacle 17a), the pin 18 may alternatively enter the receptacles 16, 17a, 17b from the opposite end (by first entering the receptacle 17b). As also discussed above, the buttress element 14 may be releasably connected to the body or flex frame 11 via one or more releasable connection means, such as, but not limited to, a clip, a clasp, a screw, a hook, etc. As best seen in FIGS. 3A-3B (showing the body or flex frame 11 in an open or closed orientation, configuration and/or position while being disconnected from the buttress element 14), in an embodiment of the tie securing, anchoring and/or supporting device or apparatus 10 alternative to the embodiment shown in FIGS. 2A-2B, the buttress element 14 may further include at least one clasp or clip 19 that operates to releasably connect the buttress element 14 to the body or flex frame 11. As such, the user 1 of the apparatus or device 10 may decide to position either the buttress element 14 or the body or flex frame 11 on the tie 2 first before connecting the buttress element 14 and the body or flex frame 11 together. Depending on the type of tie being used with the apparatus or device 10 and/or depending on the preference(s) of the user 1, the user 1 may decide whether it may be easier for the user 1 to install the buttress element 14 on the tie (such as the tie 2) first, or whether it may be easier for the user 1 to install the body or flex frame 11 on the tie (such as the tie 2) first. Additionally or alternatively, the apparatus or device 10 may include a magnet to magnet combination that further anchors the portion of the knot 4 and/or the tie 2. For example, the first and second portions 12, 13 of the body or flex frame 11 may include material that is attracted to each other via magnetic force(s). By way of another example, in at least one embodiment, a first magnet may be disposed on, or connected to, the buttress element 14, and a second magnet may be disposed such that one or more portions of the tie 2 (preferably the short end 3 of the tie 2) are located between the magnets. The magnets may be used instead of a clip and/or a pin, or may be used in addition to a clip and/or a pin. The first magnet may be built into, made integral with, and/or permanently connected to the buttress element 14, or may be connected to the buttress element 14 using fusing, gluing, bonding, press-fit, welded, etc. As shown in FIGS. 4A-4D, a magnet to magnet combination may even be used by itself as an alternative way to releasably connect the first and second portions 12, 13 of the body or flex frame 11 together. As beset seen in FIGS. 4A-4B, the first and second portions 12, 13 of the body or flex frame 11 may include one or more materials that are attracted to each other, e.g., via magnetic forces, such as, but not limited to, magnets, at least one magnet and at least one magnetic metal (e.g., metals that are attracted to magnets; metal(s) that may operate as magnets; etc.). As best seen in FIG. 4A, at least one of or both of the first and second portions 12, 13 of the body or flex frame 11 may retain the aforementioned resilient flexibility and spring-like bias when including such magnet(s) and/or such metal(s). As shown in the apparatus or device 20 of FIGS. 4A-4B, the first ends 12d, 13d of the first and second portions 12, 13 of the body or flex frame 11 may be connected via the hinge or other similar connecting element 15. The second ends 12c, 13c of the first and second portions 12, 13 of the body or flex frame 11 may be connected (e.g., directly (as best seen in FIG. 4C) and/or indirectly (e.g., through the tie 2, the portion 3 of the tie 2, another portion of the tie 2, etc. —see e.g., FIG. 4D where the magnetic force(s) may connect the first and second portions 12, 13 indirectly through the portion 3 of the tie 2 and/or may permit the first and second portions 12, 13 to be connected directly at at least respective portions thereof) by the attractive force(s) of the magnet(s) and/or the metal(s) included in the first and second portions 12, 13 of the body or flex frame 11. The magnetic force(s) is/are sufficient such that the first and second portions 12, 13 of the body or flex frame 11 may be spaced away from each other for a predetermined distance (e.g., the thickness of the portion 3 of the tie 2 resting therebetween; a distance preselected by the user 1; a distance preselected by a manufacturer of the apparatus 20; etc.), and may not separate from each other without assistance from the user 1 applying force(s) to the first and second portions 12, 13 to separate them when desired. As such, while the apparatus or device 20 of FIGS. 4A-4B may not include the pin 18 and receptacle (e.g., using the receptacles 16, 17a, 17b) arrangement, the apparatus or device 20 may include the pin 18 and receptacle (e.g., using the receptacles 16, 17a, 17b) arrangement if the user 1 desires additional locking capabilities for the device 20. Additionally or alternatively, a tie anchoring, securing and/or supporting apparatus or device may include a cinch mechanism that further anchors the tie 2. While the cinch mechanisms discussed herein may be used with a flex frame, preferably, in one or more embodiments, the one or more cinch mechanisms are employed as the body of the devices or apparatuses as an alternative to the aforementioned flex frame(s) 11 to anchor the tie 2 (as best seen in FIG. 5A). As shown in FIGS. 5A-5D, at least one embodiment of the tie securing, anchoring and/or supporting apparatus or device 30 includes a cinch mechanism 31 instead of the aforementioned flex frame(s) 11. The cinch mechanism 31 (also referred to as a body of the apparatus 30) may be attached to the buttress element 14 (and the first and second portions 14a, 14b of the buttress element 14) in the same or similar fashion as described above for the body or flex frame 11. As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the cinch mechanism 31 and the buttress element 14 may be connected to each other using any methods known to those skilled in the art, such as, but not limited to, gluing, welding, press-fitting, riveting, bonding, fusing, adhering, molding, clamping, screwing, latching, friction-fitting, etc. Additionally or alternatively, in one or more embodiments, the buttress element 14 may be releasably connectable to the cinch mechanism 31 so that the buttress element 14 and the cinch mechanism 31 may be connected for use and then disconnected after use, during manufacturing, for storage, shipment, and/or for any other suitable scenario. Preferably, the buttress element 14 and the cinch mechanism 31 are built into, made integral with, and/or permanently connected to each other. Preferably, the cinch mechanism 31 includes a spring 39 (best seen in FIG. 5B), and the cinch mechanism 31 has at least two positions (i.e., a locked or closed position (e.g., where at least two holes (see e.g., holes 41a, 41b as discussed below) of the cinch mechanism 31 are misaligned) and an unlocked or open position (e.g., where the at least two holes (see e.g., holes 41a, 41b as discussed below) of the cinch mechanism 31 are aligned) as best seen in FIGS. 5B-5C. For example, the cinch mechanism 31 may further include a button/actuation element 35 having a hole 41a in a portion thereof and at least one hole 41b in at least one surface or wall of the cinch mechanism 31 such that when the holes 41a, 41b are aligned (as best seen in FIG. 5C), the spring 39 is compressed and the cinch mechanism 31 is, therefore, in an open or unlocked position, thereby allowing the portion 3 of the tie 2 to run through the holes 41a, 41b (best seen in FIG. 5A) and/or to be removed from the holes 41a, 41b (e.g., after use). In at least one embodiment of the cinch mechanism 31, the user 1 may push the button or actuation element 35 to align the holes 41a, 41b to insert and/or remove the tie 2 therefrom (see e.g., FIG. 5C). When the user 1 wishes to have the cinch mechanism 31 clamp, hold, grip, etc. a portion of the tie 2 (e.g., the portion 3 of the tie 2), the user 1 may simply release the button or actuation element 35, and the spring 39 will force the holes 41a, 41b to become misaligned (see e.g., FIG. 5B). In an alternative embodiment, the button or actuation element 35 and the spring 39 arrangement may be designed such that the button or actuation element 35 may be pushed to compress the spring 39, and then pushed again to decompress the spring 39. For example, when the desired portion of the tie 2 (such as the portion 3 of the tie 2) is positioned properly (e.g., in a predetermined location) in the cinch mechanism 31, the user 1 may push the button 35 to decompress the spring 39 such that the at least two holes 41a, 41b become misaligned (as best seen in FIG. 5B) such that the cinch mechanism 31 is, therefore, in a closed or locked position, thereby anchoring, securing and/or supporting a portion (e.g., the portion 3) of the tie 2 therein (as best seen in FIGS. 5A and 5D). Alternatively, depending on the positioning of the hole 41a on the button/actuation element 35, the locked or closed position may occur when the spring 39 is compressed, and the unlocked or open position may occur when the spring 39 is decompressed. The cinch mechanism 31 may anchor, secure and/or support a portion (e.g., the portion 3) of the tie 2 therein regardless of whether the buttress element 14 is attached to a portion of the tie 2 and/or the knot 4 of the tie 2. The button 35 may extend through a first wall or surface 32 (e.g., a front wall or surface of the cinch mechanism 31; the wall or surface of the cinch mechanism 31 that faces away from the user 1; a wall or surface of the cinch mechanism 31 that is located between the larger, front portion of the tie 2 and the smaller, back portion (such as the portion 3) of the tie 2; etc.). The spring 39 may extend from an inside surface (e.g., the inside surface of the back wall 33) of the cinch mechanism 31. The button 35 (e.g., alone, in combination with other components of the cinch mechanism 31, etc.) and/or any other actuating member or component may operate to compress and lock the spring 39 in the locked, closed configuration of the cinch mechanism 31 as aforementioned. Indeed, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the structure and orientation of the spring 39 and the button 35 with relation to the body of the cinch mechanism 31 discussed herein may be modified in various ways while providing the benefits described herein. For example, as best seen in the cross-sectional views of FIGS. 6A-6B (taken along lines 6A-6A and 6B-6B of FIGS. 5B-5C, respectively), at least one embodiment of the cinch mechanism 31 may further include a second spring 61 and latch 62 mechanism that slides out (e.g., via the force provided by the spring 61) to lock the spring 39 in the locked configuration of the cinch mechanism 31 and slides inwards (e.g., when a portion of the button 35 and/or any other actuation member being used for the cinch mechanism 31 slides down along a curved, sloped, tapered, etc. surface of the latch 62, thereby pushing and sliding the latch 62 away from the spring 39; when a latch-catch mechanism holding the spring 61 and latch 62 mechanism in the locked position (and/or a decompressed position for the spring 61) is released, etc.) and thereby compressing the spring 61 a predetermined distance to allow the spring 39 to decompress and push the button 35 towards and into the unlocked, open configuration of the cinch mechanism 31. Preferably, while not a requirement for the cinch mechanism 31, at least a portion of the button 35 extends between, and is guided by, tracks, rails or guideposts 35a, 35b, and at least a portion of the spring 61 and latch 62 mechanism is guided by, and extends between, tracks, rails or guideposts 63, 64 (best seen in FIGS. 6A-6B). The cinch mechanism 31 may be used instead of the magnets, clip, and/or pin elements discussed above. Additionally or alternatively, the buttress element 14 may be integrated with the cinch mechanism 31 such that the cinch mechanism 31 may not require the button 35 but may instead use at least one portion (e.g., the portion 14a, the portion 14b, etc.) of the buttress element 14 to actuate, and compress and/or decompress, the spring 39, thereby controlling the locking and unlocking of the cinch mechanism 31. For example, as shown in FIGS. 7A-7B, at least one embodiment of the apparatus or device 40 may include a cinch mechanism 31 where the hole 41 a is positioned on, and extends through, a surface or wall (e.g., the back surface or wall 33) of the cinch mechanism 31 and the hole 41b is positioned, and extends through, another surface or wall (e.g., the front surface or wall 32, a top surface or wall, a bottom surface or wall, etc.) of the cinch mechanism 31. At least one portion (e.g., the portion 14a as shown in FIGS. 7A-7B; the portion 14b; etc.) of the buttress element 14 may be attached to, and extend into, the body of the cinch mechanism 31, and may include a third hole 41c on at least a section of the portion (e.g., the portion 14a as shown in FIGS. 7A-7B; the portion 14b; etc.) of the buttress element 14. The spring 39 may be located between the portion (e.g., the portion 14a as shown in FIGS. 7A-7B; the portion 14b; etc.) of the buttress element 14 and a surface or wall (e.g., the bottom surface or wall 34 as shown in FIGS. 7A-7B) of the cinch mechanism 31 such that the at least one portion (e.g., the portion 14a as shown in FIGS. 7A-7B; the portion 14b; etc.) of the buttress element 14 may operate to compress and/or decompress the spring 39. Thus, when all three holes 41a, 41b, 41c are aligned (as best seen in FIG. 7B), the spring 39 is compressed and the cinch mechanism 31 is, therefore, in an open or unlocked position, thereby allowing the portion 3 of the tie 2 to run through, and/or be disposed in, the holes 41a, 41b, 41c and/or to be removed from the holes 41a, 41b, 14c (e.g., after use). When the desired portion of the tie 2 (such as the portion 3 of the tie 2) is positioned properly (e.g., in a predetermined location) in the cinch mechanism 31, the user 1 may release or push the at least one portion (e.g., the portion 14a as shown in FIGS. 7A-7B; the portion 14b; etc.) of the buttress element 14 to decompress the spring 39 such that the spring 39 causes the third hole 41c to misalign from at least one of the first and second holes 41a, 41b (as best seen in FIG. 7A). As a result, the cinch mechanism 31 is in a closed or locked position, thereby anchoring, securing and/or supporting a portion (e.g., the portion 3) of the tie 2 therein. Alternatively, depending on the positioning of the hole 41c on the at least one portion (e.g., the portion 14a as shown in FIGS. 7A-7B; the portion 14b; etc.) of the buttress element 14, the locked or closed position of the cinch mechanism 31 may occur when the spring 39 is compressed (e.g., the spring 39 is locked in a compressed position), and the unlocked or open position may occur when the spring 39 is decompressed. For example, the at least one portion of the buttress element 14 (e.g., the portion 14a of the buttress element 14 that is disposed in the knot 4 of the tie 2, the portion 14b, etc.) may be moved towards, and/or further into, the cinch mechanism 31 of the apparatus or device 40 (e.g., the spring 39 is compressed) to align/misalign the three holes 41a, 41b, 41c or, in one or more other embodiments, may be moved away from the cinch mechanism 31 (e.g., by using the force of the spring 39; by the user 1 pulling on the at least one portion of the buttress element 14; etc.) of the apparatus or device 40 to align the three holes 41a, 41b, 41c, depending on the location of the third hole 41c of the at least one portion (e.g., the portion 14a as shown in FIGS. 7A-7B; the portion 14b; etc.) of the buttress element 14. Additionally or alternatively, the cinch mechanism 31 may be of any geometric shape or cross-sectional geometric shape while still possessing the structural attributes and features discussed herein. For example, as best seen in FIG. 8, a tie securing, anchoring and/or supporting apparatus or device 80 may include the buttress element 14 attached to the cinch mechanism 31, where the cinch mechanism 31 has a triangular cross-sectional shape.
