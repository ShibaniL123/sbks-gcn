(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahy drobenzo[4,5]thieno[3,2-c]pyridin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate
N-(1-(benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine 6b (82 mg, 0.309 mmol) and (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-formylphenyl) acrylate 1e (84 mg, 0.371 mmol) were dissolved in 2 mL of toluene, then acetic acid (37 mg, 0.618 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred under reflux for 24 hours, then the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by thin-layer chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[4,5]thieno[3,2-c]pyridin-1-yl)phenyl)a crylate 6c (32 mg, yield 22%) as a yellow solid. MS m/z (ESI): 373.9 [M+1]
