A METHOD AND QUALITY CONTROL MOLECULAR BASED MOUSE EMBRYO ASSAY FOR USE WITH IN VITRO FERTILIZATION TECHNOLOGY CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS [0001J This application claims priority from Provisional Application US Application 61/783.557, filed March 14, 2013, entitled A METHOD AND QUALITY CONTROL MOLECULAR BASED MOUSE EMBRYO ASSAY FOR USE WITH IN VITRO FERTILIZATION TECHNOLOGY, which is Incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention [0002] The present Invention relates to a method for assessing products used in cellular biology, for example, in vitro fertilization. Also disclosed is a quality control assay for use in clinical Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART). Description of the Related Art [0003] The in vitro fertilization (IVF) laboratory plays a fundamental role in the treatment of infertile couples. Ensuring proper Quality Control (QC) in the IVF laboratory is critical to the success of any IVF program, as the environment of the laboratory can alter the quality of the embryos produced. An optimal culture medium and a stable environment are necessary for the successful development of human embryos in vitro. The ultimate role of the embryology laboratory is to maintain the inherent viability of the gametes and embryos in an environment outside the female reproductive tract. The dynamic nature of pre-implantation embryo development is unique because, unlike somatic cell culture, embryos are constantly and rapidly changing, both in morphology and function (Leese 1991; Bavister 1995). [0004| During development, pre-implantation embryos change rapidly, in just a matter of days, from a metabolically quiescent, undifferentiated single cell under the genetic control of maternal transcripts into a dynamic, multi-ceiled embryo that has developed homeostatic mechanisms and its own functioning genome (Leese 1991; Lane 2001; Gardner ei at. 2005). The early embryo, which depends υη a pyruvate-based metabolism and is solely dependent on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for energy production; like a unicellular organism, the early embryo lacks many key regulatory functions for pH and osmotic control. After compaction at the eight- to 16-cell stage (dependent on species), there is a change in metabolic control to a highly glycolytic metabolism. Concomitantly, there is also a marked transition in the functional complexity of other cellular mechanisms as the embryo's physiology becomes more like that of a somatic cell. It is the initially crude nature of homeostatic regulation in the early embryo and its subsequent development through later stages of pre-implantation development that pose significant challenges in the laboratory. Maintenance of a favorable in vitro environment is essential for maximizing viability and promoting ongoing development. 10005] Perturbations to the environment surrounding the embryo during development in culture, relative to ‘'normal"' conditions encountered in the reproductive tract, result in reduced embryo viability and impaired development. As discussed below, there is a need for objective, sensitive, and reproducible methods and assays for testing materials used in human IVF for embryo toxicity as well as growth promoting and inhibiting factors. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION {00061 ft is often difficult to assess the impact of suboptimal environment using morphology as a marker on embryos and other cells. For example, in certain instances, embryos that develop to apparently morphologically normal blastocysts may, in fact, not be completely normal or healthy. Such apparently morphologically normal blastocysts can be compromised at the cellular level, for example. Compromised blastocysts may have a reduced capacity to implant and produce a successful term pregnancy. The environment that an embryo is exposed to during collection and culture can significantly alter its developmental potential and cellular regulation. The mouse embryo assay (ΜΕΑ) has been the gold standard to examine the applicability of culture media and environment without involving human materials. The basic techniques and protocols employed for performing the ME A are set forth in In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer: A Manual of Basic Techniques (Don Ρ. Wolf. Editor), 1988. pages 57-75: the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Briefly, the assay involves superovulation of female mice with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), The mice are placed with males at the lime ohhCG injection and killed 24 hours following hCG to obtain one-cell embryos or 36 hours after injection to obtain two-celi embryos. One-cell embryos are selected for use if they have two polar bodies visible; two cel! embryos are selected for use if they look morphologically normal. [0007] The ΜΕΑ is used for toxicity and functionality testing of reproductive media, labware, or any device coining into contact with gametes and/or embryos. The rationale for requiring information on this test as a special control for class II assisted reproduction devices is that it is a good surrogate indicator of potential toxicity of materials used in assisted reproduction devices to gametes and/or embryos. The FDA has recognized that the ΜΕΑ is currently the most appropriate test for embryo toxicity. Briefly, both one-cell and two-cell assays are used, and these are identical except that one-cell embryos are flushed from the mouse oviduct earlier than two-cell embryos. Whether a one-cell or two-cell ΜΕΛ is used, the bioassay should represent, as closely as possible, the corresponding procedures used for which the device is used for human iVF, such as the acquisition, maintenance, culture, transfer (relocation) and cryopreservation of embryos. Typically, embryo morphology is assessed and blastocyst formation is determined alter 96 hours of culture. If more than 80% of the zygotes have reached the blastocyst stage, the medium, labware, or other equipment tested are considered suitable for clinical use. [0008] fn addition to detecting embryo toxicity, the ΜΕΑ is capable of detecting suboptimai raw materials, media, and contact materials associated with IVF and ART. 1 lowever, there are a number of limitations of this assay which arc often overlooked. For example, the assay can only detect conditions which are grossly and harshly embryo toxic. The ME A cannot detect or differentiate growth promoting or inhibiting factors at a very early stage in development. [0009] Embodiments described herein generally are directed to systems and methods for providing a molecular based mouse embryo assay (mMEA) for use as a quality control in, for example, in viiro fertilization (IVF) arenas and/or Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART), and more specifically to an improved assay for assessing embryonic development from the one-ceil or two-cell stage to the blastocyst stage. {0010] From this description, in conjunction with other items, the advantages of the invention will become dear and apparent based upon the hereinafter descriptions and claims, which are supported by drawings as described in the following sections. {0011] In one aspect, a quality control method for assessing products used for human iVF or ART is provided. The method includes providing a transgenic embryo (at least one-cell) and culturing the embryo in vitro for a specified period of time.

Acceptability or failure of the tested items is determined based upon qualitative and quantitative analyses of the embryo development. Optionally, the one-cell embryo includes at least one fluorescent protein transgene operably linked to the regulatory region of at least one embryonic development/pluripotencv regulator. {0012} The transgene may include a reporter gene encoding a selected fluorescent protein such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), red fluorescent protein, cyan fluorescent protein, orange fluorescent protein or yellow fluorescent protein, {00J3] In another aspect, the quality control method and assay are designed to evaluate test items used in IVF environments and/or ART. The test items may include gamete and embryo culture media, gamete and embryo handling/processing media (to include washing and separation media), transport media, enzymes for denuding oocytes, gradient for sperm separation, freezing/vitrification media, thawing/vvarming media, pipette and embryo handling devices, lab-ware used in the process of human in vitro fertilization including but not limited to Petri dishes, centrifuge tubes, cryopreservation and Cryo-storage devices, and any solutions, reagents or devices involved with in vitro ART related procedures. {0014J In another aspect, evaluation of embryonic development is accomplished by analysis of general embryo morphology related to the developmental stages of the embryos and/or the loeation/quantity/quality of fluorescence. Preferably, the embryo is derived from a mammal and can include murine, porcine, equine, bovine, ovine, leporine, and non-human primate embryo. fOOlS] In still another aspect, the operably linked embryonic pluripoteney regulator may include without limitation Oct-4. Sox2, Nanog.

The assay advantageously includes a transgenic one-cell embryo harvested from a transgenic mammal, wherein the embryo comprises at least one reporter gene operably linked to the regulatory region of at least one embryonic pluripotency marker; and instructions for evaluating ART products and IVF culture conditions. The instructions can include incubating a transgenic one-cell embryo under certain culture conditions and evaluating embryo development based upon morphology from the one and two-cell to blasiulation and gastrulation stages. [0018] Optionally, the reporter gene encodes a fluorescent protein, such as Green Fluorescent Protein, Red Fluorescent Protein, Cyan fluorescent Protein, Orange Fluorescent Protein, or Yellow' Fluorescent Protein. [0019] In another aspect, the assay includes at least one transgenic embryo, wherein the transgene comprises at least one embryonic pluripotency regulator and/or its regulatory regions (e.g., upstream mediators and/or downstream effectors), where the pluripotency regulator plays a role in ensuring normal embryo development. The test items/growth conditions may be evaluated based on embryo growth, development and quality based upon assessment of embryo morphology and/or qualitative/quantitative assessment of fluorescence. The acceptable threshold for optimal embryo growth and development is based on individual set criteria depending on test items and expected development under normaf/eontrol conditions. In the event that the test items do not meet the established acceptance criteria compared to a normal control, they would be considered suboptimal or embryotoxic (i.e.. unacceptable). [1)020] In still another aspect of the invention, an embryo assay with enhanced sensitivity for use in quality control of clinical human ART/IVF is described. The assay may include a transgenic one-cell embryo. The embryo can include at least one reporter gene operably linked to at least one gene associated with embryonic development.

The evaluation may comprise determining fluorescence of the reporter gene. The assay may detect embryo-toxicity in culture media and/or culture materials. In one aspect, the assay detects functionality of media and suitability of materials used in clinical in vitro fertilization environments. [0023] A modified, transgenic embryo, comprising at least one transgene operably linked to the regulatory region of at least one embryonic pluripotency regulator is disclosed. The embryonic pluripotency regulators include these regulators* genes as well as their upstream mediators and downstream effectors that play a role in ensuring normal embryo development. Advantageously, the transgene is a reporter gene. The reporter gene may be a fluorescent or luminescent protein such as green fluorescent protein, red fluorescent protein, cyan fluorescent protein, orange fluorescent protein, or yellow fluorescent protein.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS j0032j After reading this description it will become apparent to one skilled in the art how to implement the invention in various alternative embodiments and alternative applications. However, all the various embodiments of the present invention will not be described herein. It will be understood that the embodiments presented here are presented by way of an example only, and not limitation. As such, this detailed description of various alternative embodiments should not be construed to limit the scope or breadth of the present invention as set forth below. ['0033] Before the present invention is disclosed and described, it is to be understood that the aspects described below are not limited to specific compositions, methods of preparing such compositions, or uses thereof as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular aspects only and is not intended to be limiting. ]0034| The detailed description of the invention is di vided into various sections only for the reader's convenience and disclosure found in any section may be combined with that in another section. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs, 10035] In this specification and in the claims that follow, reference will be made to a number of terms that shall be defined to have the following meanings: [0036] The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be li miting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms "a”, "an" and "the" are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. [0037j “Optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance can or cannot occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not. [0038} The term “comprising’- is intended to mean that the compositions and methods include the recited elements, but not excluding others. “Consisting essentially of" when used to define compositions and methods, shall mean excluding other elements of any essential significance to the combination. For example, a composition consisting essentially of the elements as defined herein would not exclude other elements that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristie(s) uf the claimed invention. “Consisting of’ shall mean excluding more than trace amount of other ingredients and substantial method steps recited. Embodiments defined by each of these transition terms are within the scope of this invention. [0039] As used herein, the term “regulatory region” includes ail of the elements and/or sequences of the gene of interest that are required for proper expression of that gene. Known regulatory elements include promoters, enhancers, silencers, insulators, and the like. Regulatory regions can include regions upstream of the transcription start site (5’ untranslated region), downstream of the transcription start site, within nitrons, in the 3’ untranslated region, or within coding sequences. For example, the regulatory region may include only the minimum essential elements of the viability marker gene to direct expression of the transgene. In other aspects, the regulatory region may include larger portions or substantially all of the viability marker gene, including part or all of the coding region. The regulatory may also include upstream mediators and/or downstream effectors. (0040] As used herein, the term “viability marker” refers to any gene whose expression or lack thereof indicates the viability of the embryo during at least one stage of development. Viability markers include embryonic development markers and piuripotency markers. Generally, these markers include embryonic stem cell associated transcript genes. Pluripotent stem cell markers, as used herein, are expressed at a predictable level and location at a predictable time of embryonic development. Viability markers may be expressed at a certain stage of embryo development. Expression at a certain time during development may indicate that the embryo is developing normally; lack of expression may indicate abnormal development. Alternatively, viability markers may be genes that are not normally expressed at a certain stage of embryo development, and whose expression at such a time indicates abnormal development. [0041] As used herein, the term “reporter gene” includes any gene that can be operablv linked to the regulatory region of a viability marker and can be visualized or otherwise evaluated to determine its expression. In a preferred embodiment, the reporter gene is a fluorescent or luminescent protein. In some embodiments, the reporter gene may be or include, for example, an epitope tag (e.g., HIS, FLAG, HA) that is recognized by an antibody. 10042J As used herein, "•acceptability’" of a product is determined by rates of survival, development, and'or reporter gene expression of blastocysts that are approximately equal to or better than that observed in the control or a standard (e.g.. greater than 80% developed blastocysts). Likewise, “failure'" as used herein is determined by rates that are below that observed in the control or a standard. [0043] As used herein, “control conditions” are the conditions known to provide for optimal embryo growth and/or development. “Test conditions’' are conditions employing the IVF product to be tested for its effect on embryo growth and development. 10044] ‘Optimal” conditions as used herein, refers ΐυ conditions which promote healthy, unfettered embryonic development. “Sub-optimal" conditions, by contrast, are culture conditions which allow for some cellular growth but the growth is slower and less robust than what would be predicted to be observed under optimal culture conditions. “Embryo toxicity” as used herein, refers to culture conditions which induce abnormal development or embryo death. [0045j “Assisted Reproductive Technology” or ART, as used herein, includes all fertility treatments in which both female gametes (eggs or oocytes) and male gametes (sperm) are handled. In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is one of several assisted reproductive techniques used to assist infertile couples in conceiving a child. IVF refers to the procedure by which eggs are removed from the female’s ovary and fertilized with sperm in a laboratory procedure. The fertilized egg (embryo) can be cryopreserved for future use or transferred to the uterus. [0046] As used herein, “blastocyst” refers to a structure in early embryonic development consisting of a ball of cells with surrounding wall (tropheclodenn or IF ) which will form the placenta, a fluid filled cavity (hlastocoels) which will form the amniotic sac, and an internal cluster of cells called the inner cell mass (1CM) from which the fetus arises. Other terms relating to the invention, are defined and described in more detail below. |0047j Generally disclosed herein are methods, systems and kits related to assessing the impact on the culture and development of biological cells of certain culture conditions or parameters. For example, some embodiments relate to a quality control method for assessing the culture conditions for in vitro fertilization or ART. For example, fertilized embryos harvested from reporter-transgenic animal, such as a mouse, are used to detect possible detrimental or sub-optimal culture conditions or parameters. Effectively, the transgenic embryos provide a more sensitive and functionally relevant qualitative quality control (QC) assay for testing and qualifying devices lor use in clinical in vitro fertilization and ART laboratories, for example. (0048] As will be described in greater detail below, the method can include providing a transgenic blastocyst with at least one-cell; culturing the blastocyst under in vitro or Assisted Reproductive Technology ("ART”) culture conditions, ana evaluating blastocyst differentiation to determine the acceptability of the culture conditions. Quality control assays and methods of performing quality control assays as described in detail below include a mammalian transgenic embryo (at least one-cell). In preferred embodiments, the embryo is at the one- or two-cell stage. The mammalian embryo can be obtained from bovine, ovine, porcine, murine, canine, equine, simian, or human origin. In some embodiments, the mammalian embryo is porcine, equine, or bovine. More commonly, the embryo is murine derived. j00491 The molecular ΜΕΑ as described herein can have many advantages over the standard ΜΕΑ that is currently used to test IVF reagents and consumables. The standard ΜΕΑ is based on a determination of the morphology of the embryos at one or more stages of development. In contrast, the molecular ΜΕΑ can utilize molecular analysis of developmental markers to determine the effects of a test product on embryo development. Also, the molecular ΜΕΑ can couple molecular analysis of developmental markers with morphological analysis to determine the effects of a test product on embryo development. Benefits include availability of early results, increased sensitivity, and the availability of automation. Subupiirnal culture conditions may be apparent as early as 48 hours when using mouse embryos. In addition, IVF reagents having small deleterious effects, especially effects that affect gene expression but not morphology, may be observed. Reporter gene expression, as represented, for example, by fluorescence, can be determined quantitatively or qualitatively, including for example, by a mechanized method, allowing for increased automation (e.g., an automated assessment). [0050J Titles or subtitles may be used in the specification for the convenience of a reader, which are not intended to influence the scope of the present invention. Additionally, some terms used in this specification are more specifically defined below. L Methods I'OOSl | The culture of gametes and embryos is an integral part of any reproductive research laboratory, as is the use of plastic and glassware, and other consumables, such as gloves, plates, media, chemicals, and oil.

In some embodiments, the product is used in the method in a manner similar to its intended use in ART. In some embodiments, the method further comprises determining the acceptability or failure of said product based upon the assessment. [0056] In some embodiments, the methods can include, for example, evaluating the morphology of the embryo during at least one stage of development of the embryo. In some embodiments, the transgenic embryo is provided as a one-cell embryo or two-cell embryo. In some embodiments, the transgenic embryo is from a mammal.

In some embodiments, the specified duration is determined by the desired developmental stage, for example through the 2-cei!~stage, 4-cell stage, 8-cell stage, morula stage, blastocyst stage, gasirulation stage, or beyond. 10058} In some embodiments, the evaluating step can include, for example, one or more of; i. capturing at least one image of said embryo; ii, determining a level of expression of said reporter gene based on the image; and iii. comparing said level of expression to a threshold level and/or a control level. In some embodiments, steps ii and iii arc performed by a computer. In some embodiments, the evaluating may include measuring light emission and/or intensity visually, or using a device lor the same. [0059] In some embodiments, the evaluating step further may include comparing the expression of the transgene or at least one reporter gene in a transgenic embryo that has been cultured under control conditions.

[0061 ] In some embodiments, the product can be deemed acceptable, for example, if expression of the transgene or at least one reporter gene is sufficient to indicate that the embryo is not affected by the use of the test product. In some embodiments, sufficiency of expression is determined by comparison to a control and/or comparison to other cells being tested. In some embodiments, sufficiency of expression is determined by comparison to a pre-determined standard. In some embodiments, the product is deemed acceptable if the morphology of the embryo is appropriate. In some embodiments, appropriate morphology is determined by comparison to a control. In some embodiments, appropriate morphology is determined by comparison to a pre-determined standard. In some embodiments morphology and expression can be assessed to determine the impact of a parameter on embryo development. For example, if both morphology and expression are positive, then an assessment of no negative impact or a positive impact can be made. If the morphology is favorable, but expression is poor at one or more time points, then an appropriate assessment can be made, for example, that there is an adverse or negative impact, 10062] In some embodiments, the level of fluorescence of embryos in a test condition is compared to the level of fluorescence of embryos in a control condition to determine whether the test condition is acceptable. In some embodiments, the percentage of embryos exhibiting a certain level of fluorescence (e.g,, 0-1 or 2-3) is compared. In some embodiments, an acceptable level of fluorescence observed in embryos in test condition is 50% or greater of fluorescence observed in embryos in control condition. In some embodiments, an acceptable level of fluorescence observed in embryos in test condition is 60% or greater of fluorescence observed in embryos in control condition.

It should be understood that any subvalue or subrange from within the values described above are contemplated for use with the embodiments described herein. 10066] In some embodiments, the level of fluorescence of embryos in a test condition is compared to a standard. In some embodiments, the standard is based on the transgenc/marker used, the species embryo used, the type of reagent being tested, the microscope used, or any other parameter.

[0G69j Some embodiments relate to methods for enhancing the sensitivity of art embryo assay using embryo development to the blastocyst stage. The methods can include for example providing a transgenic embryo comprising at least one reporter gene operably linked to at least one embryonic piuripotency marker, incubating the transgenic embryo under culture conditions utilizing test items and/or control; and evaluating embryo development morphologically and via the expression of the embryonic marker from one-cell to blastocyst and gastrulation stages. The methods can further include evaluating expression of the embryonic marker at the blastocyst stage and beyond (gastrulation). Evaluation of expression can be measured, for example, by determining fluorescence or other light emission of the reporter gene. The embryo assay can detect embryo-toxicity in culture media and/or culture materials. In another embodiment, the assay can detect functionality of media and suitability of materials used in clinical in vitro ferti 1 i zation en vironments. [0070] An assay for testing the effectiveness of glassware washing techniques, cleansing of surgical instruments (aspiration needle), transfer catheters and any other item that comes in contact with the human eggs, sperm or embryos is likewise encompassed by the current technology and methods. [0071J The term “transgenic” means of or pertaining to a segment of DMA that has been incorporated into a host genome or is capable of replication in a host cell and is capable of causing expression of one or more cellular products. Exemplary transgenes can provide the host cell, or animals developed therefrom, with a novel phenotype relative to the corresponding non-transformed cell or animal. "Transgenic animal" means a non-human animal, usually a mammal, having a non-endogenous nucleic acid sequence present as an extrachromosornal element in at least a portion of its ceils or stably integrated into its germ line DNA. (00721 Transgenesis is used to create transgenic mammals such as mice with reporter genes linked to a gene of interest. Methods in molecular genetics and genetic engineering are described generally in the current editions of Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, (Sambrook et ah); Oligonucleotide Synthesis (Μ. .1. Gait, eel.): Animal Cell Culture (R, 1. Freshney, ed.); Gene Transfer Vectors for Mammalian Cells (Miller & Caios, eds.); Current Protocols in Molecular Biology and Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, S.sup.rd Edition (F. Μ. Ausubel et a!., eds.); and Recombinant DNA Methodology (R. Wu ed., Academic Press). Thus, transgenic technology is well established. See, e.g. Transgenic Mouse: Methods and Protocols (Μ. Ilofker and J. Dcurscn, Eds.) in Methods in Molecular Biology (Vo!. 209) (the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety). [0073} In one aspect, the transgenic mammal includes a reporter gene linked to the regulatory region of a viability marker gene of interest. Reporter genes include, for example, fluorescent or luminescent proteins such as luciferase, green fluorescent protein, or red fluorescent protein. Fluorescent proteins can include, without limitation, btue/UV proteins such as TagBFP, rnTagBFP2, azurite, EBFP2, mKalamal, Sirius, sapphire, and Τ-sapphire. Fluorescent proteins can also include cyan proteins such as ECFP, cerulean, SCFP.3A, mTurquoise, mTurquoise2, monomeric Midoriishi-Cyan, TagCFP, and niTFPI. In a preferred embodiment, the fluorescent protein is a green protein such as EGFP, Emerald, Superfolder GFP, Monomeric Azami Green, TagGFP2, mUKG, mWasabi, or Clover. Yellow fluorescent proteins including EYFP, Citrine, Venus, SYFP2, ZsYeilowl, and TagYFP are likewise contemplated for use as a reporter gene. Orange proteins for use as reporter genes can include Monomeric Kusabira-Orange. mKOk, ηΐΚ02, rnOrange, and rnOranged. Red proteins such as HcRcdl, mRaspbcrry, mCherry, mStrawbcrry, mTangerine, tdTomato, lagRFP, mApple, mRuby, and niRubyd. Far-red proteins include, without limitation, mPlum, 11cRed-Tandem, mK.ate2. mNeptune, and NirFP. I'he embryos of transgenic mice express the reporter protein(s) at the same time and location that e the marker(s) of interest is expressed. {0074] In some embodiments, the transgenic animal comprises more than one transgene operably linked to the regulatory region of an embryonic viability marker. In some embodiments, the transgenic animal comprises 2. 3. 4, or more transgenes operably linked to the regulatory region of different embryonic viability marker. For example, a transgenic animal may comprise multiple fluorescent reporter genes, each linked to a different viability marker such that multiple fluorescent proteins are expressed in the embryo. The expression of the reporter genes may change as the embryo develops. In a preferred embodiment, all of the reporter genes that are expressed in the embryo can be analyzed by the same method, e.g., fluorescence microscopy. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that analysis of multiple genes in the same embryo(s) can lead to increased sensitivity, [0075] In some aspects, gametes will be harvested from male and female animals (sperm and oocytes, respectively) and the oocytes will be fertilized in vitro using methods similar to IVF protocols. In some aspects, the male and female animals will be mated, and resulting embryo(s) harvested from the female animal at the desired time point. In a preferred embodiment, the female is wild type (i.e., does not carry the transgene) and the male is transgenic. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that expression of the transgene from maternal transcripts in an early embryo will result in undesirable background expression of the transgene. In some embodiments, the female is transgenic and the male is wild type. In some embodiments, both the male and the female comprise the transgene. In some embodiments, the female and male animals carry one or more different transgenes. One of skill in the art would understand that different viability markers are expressed at different times during development, and as such expression from maternal transcripts is not an important consideration for all viability markers. [0076] As used herein, viability markers include embryonic development markers and pluripotency markers, as well as gene families and/or genes regulated by such markers. Generally, these markers include embryonic stem cell associated transcript genes. PI impotent stem cell, markers, as used herein, are expressed at a predictable level and location at a predictable time of embryonic development. Pluripotent stem cell (PS)specific markers include, but are not limited to, the family of oetamer transcription factors, i.e. Oct-4; genes regulated by Oct-4; the family of Sox genes, e.g.. Sox 1. Sox2. Sox3, Sox 15. and Sox 18; the family of Klf genes such as Klf4 and K.lf'5; the family of Nanog genes, e.g., NANOG, as well as their regulatory regions. Other viability markers include, without limitation, the TGF-beta superfamily and their receptors, i.e. Activ RIB/ALK-4, GDF-3 and Lefty, the cryptic protein family, i.e. Cripto-1, the integrin family, i.e. integrin alpha 6 (CD491) and integrin beta 1 (CD29), the Podocalyxin family, i.e. PODX-1. the FGF family, i.e. FGF4 and KiF-5. the fork head box transcription factor family, i.e. FoxD3. the T-box family of transcription factor, i.e. ΤΒΧ3 and ΤΒΧ5. the family of developmental pluripotency associated molecules, i.e. Dppa2, Dppa3/Stella, Dppa4 and Dpna.5/ESG1. the LRR family, i.e. 5Τ4, the eadherin family, i.e. E-Cadberin, the connexin family of transmembrane proteins, i.e. Connexin-43 and Connexin-45, the F-box family of “other” category, i.e. FB0X015, the family of chemokine/chemokme receptors i.e. CCR4 and CXCR4, the ATP-binding Casstet Transporters, i.e. ABCG2. Additional common known markers involved in OCT-4 and/or SOX2-mcdiated sternness maintenance are Ulfl, TERT, Zscan4, CD9, CD 15/Lcwis X, CD25, CD30/TNFRSF8. CD90/Tny1, Alkaline Phosphatasc/ALPL, alpha UCC, I ICG, DNMT3B, GBX2, GCNF/NR6A1. Gi24/Dicsl/VISTA, , IJN-28A, LIN-28B, LIN-41, c-Myc, Rex-l/ZFP42, sFRP-2, Smad2, Smad2/3, SPARC, STAT.3, SUZ12, ΤΟΒΧ2, ΤΕΧ19/19.1, ΤΗΑΡ11, and TROP-2. A person of skill in the art would understand that any viability marker, currently known or to be discovered, is encompassed by the present invention. [O077J Also contemplated and disclosed is a modified, transgenic embryo, comprising at least one transgene operablv linked to at least one embryonic pluripotency marker. The embryonic pluripotency markers and their upstream mediators and downstream effectors play a role in ensuring normal embryo development, fn a preferred embodiment, the transgene is a reporter gene. In a preferred embodiment, the reporter gene is a fluorescent or luminescent protein selected from the group consisting of green fluorescent protein, red fluorescent protein, cyan fluorescent protein, orange fluorescent protein, yellow fluorescent protein. III. Analysis of Embryo Development (0078) The suitability of a particular product for use in clinical A RT is evaluated based on embryo growth, development and/or quality. Qualitative scoring of embryo development can be based upon a qualsiativc/quantitative assessment of expression of a marker, for example, by assessing light emission or intensity or fluorescence, or any other visual indicator such as color, In some embodiments, assessment of embryo morphology also can be done and utilized together with the expression analysis. (0079) In some embodiments, one or more controls can be included for comparative purposes. For both control and test products, roughly the same number of onc-ccll or two-cell embryos can be cultured in vitro. For example, in one non-limiting approach 30 embryos can be divided up between ten drops that are each cultured in a separate well. In some aspects, the control and test products can each have approximately 30 embryos divided up between ten drops aud wells. Any other suitable number can be tested and run as well. [0080] Qualitative analysis of embryo development can be accomplished by analyzing the developing embryo by measuring or assessing color, light intensity or fluorescence visually, for example, via light microscopy which may include UV light to visualize fluorescent protein expression. Such measuring or assessing also can include or can take into account the location of the color, light or fluorescence within the blastocyst. As will be seen in greater detail with reference to the Examples and Figures, optimal and suboptima! culture conditions can be assessed or determined based upon location of the fluorescence (nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization, etc.), as well as the intensity of fluorescence, [0081] As wiil be readily appreciated by a skilled artisan, the acceptable threshold for optimal embryo growth can be based on individual set criteria, tor example culture conditions, the developmental marker, the transgene/reporter gene, and test items. Blastocyst differentiation can be evaluated via confocal microscopy. In a preferred embodiment, acceptability of culture conditions is based upon the qualitative analysis of embryo development via fluorescence microscopy. In a particularly preferred embodiment, embryonic development is observed via an embryo scope (e.g., EmbryoScope3'' Time-lapse system, Unisense Fertilitech A/S), wherein a picture of developing embryos can be taken as desired, for example, approximately every 10 minutes and a time-lapse video can be generated to track all stages of embryo development. As illustrated in the Figures (as will be described in greater detail with reference to the Examples), embryo development can be determined both in terms of chronology (stage reached for a specific culture duration) and embryo quality, both morphologically and functionally, by assessing the location and quantity/intensity of the fluorescence or other light or indicator. Expression of single markers in a test cell wifi provide evidence of undifferentiated or differentiated phenotype, according to the expression pattern. Expression of genes that are down-regulated and/or lack of expression of genes that are up-regulated upon deveiopment/differentiation may indicate the stage of development of the embryo. [0082J Embryo development and quality can be assessed qualitatively and/or quantitatively. In some embodiments, qualitative assessment of fluorescence (and morphology) is performed, for example by visualization of the blastocyst under a microscope. A qualitative analysis of expression (e.g.. via fluorescence) may involve, for example, a subjective rating of fluorescence intensity of the test samples, and optionally control samples (e.g., no fluorescence, low intensity, medium intensity, high intensity). In one non-limiting embodiment, a scale of 0-3 can be used where a rating of 0-1 means little or no light or expression, 2-3 means medium to high expression or light. The rating can be done, for example, based upon relative expression of a group of samples to each other. For example, a relative rating of 5, 10, 20, or 30 wells, where each well is categorized on a scale. In some embodiments, the scale is between 0 and 3. In some aspects, a score of 2 or greater can mean that the development is normal. In some aspects, a score of 2 or greater, coupled with proper development in an ΜΕΑ can mean that the development is normal or acceptable. Conversely, a score of 0-1 can mean that the tested product or parameter is unacceptable, even where the visual morphology if assessed (e.g., using ΜΕΑ looks acceptable). Such a low score can help avoid false positives that otherwise would have occurred if one were using ME A alone. Acceptable limits may be determined, for example, as described above. 10083j In a preferred embodiment, embryo development can be assessed quantitatively or semi-quantitatively. Non-limiting examples include assessment of fluorescence or light intensity by a computer attached to the microscope, assessment of intensity based on a photograph of the embryo, measurement of light, intensity rising a photometer or a fluoromefer, or any other method of determining fluorescence intensity. In some embodiments, determination of fluorescence intensity is automated. In some embodiments, a camera or other device present on the microscope detects the fluorescence signal(s) and transmits the signal to a software program capable of determining fluorescence intensity and/or comparing fluorescence intensity to intensity from other embryos, e.g., embryos grown under control conditions. |0084{ In some embodiments, the fluorescence intensity and/or location of the fluorescence for each embryo grown under each condition (e.g.. test and control) is measured separately. In some embodiments, multiple embryos are grown in a confined area, for example a single droplet of media, and the fluorescence intensity of all of the embryos in the area are assessed or measisred together. As noted above, the assessment or qualitative/quantitative measure can be based upon a comparative assessment to other tested samples, including a control, if present. [0085} As noted, the methods can include, if desired, qualitative assessment based upon visually assessing morphology, for example, as done with the mouse embryo assay (ME A). Such assessment can Include a comparison of embryonic development from day 0, starting at the 1-cell stage, to the blastocyst stage, for example, by 96 hours in culture. One daj' alter fertilization, for example, one would expect to observe cleavage of the embryo in both the control and embryos cultured on the test product. Two days after fertilization, in the case of murine assays, one would expect to observe eight-cell stage of development under optimal conditions in both the control and test product if the test product is to be deemed acceptable for use in ART. The number of embryos that develop to the blastocyst stage is likewise quantified in both the control and test product. An assessment is made with regard to suitability of the test product for use in ART based upon the number of viable blastocysts observed as well as qualitative appearance of those blastocysts when observed microscopically. VI. Assays and Kits [0Θ86) Methods and assay kits with a higher level of sensitivity than standard ΜΕΑ assays for evaluating embryo impact or toxicity associated with ART products is likewise described herein. The methods can include providing an assay comprising a transgenic embryo having at least the regulatory region of a reporter gene operably linked to a pluripolency marker. Also, a control product which promotes or is known to result in normal embryo development can be provided. The control product can have the same or similar use in ART as the use intended for the test product. [0087| In some embodiments, the product to be tested can be culture media or supplements. As used herein, culture media includes, without limitation, reproductive media and supplements used for assisted reproduction procedures. Media include liquid and powder versions of various substances which come in direct physical contact with embryos (e.g. water, acid solutions used to treat gametes or embryos, rinsing solutions, reagents, sperm separation media, or oil used to cover the media) for the purposes of preparation, maintenance, transfer or storage. Supplements, as used herein, include specific reagents added to media to enhance specific properties of the media such as proteins, sera, antibiotics, or the like. [0088] The acceptability of the test product can be compared to a control product by assessing embryo development at 2-eell-stage, 4-cell stage, 8-cell stage, morula stage, blastocyst stage and/or gastrulation stage. More particularly, the transgenic embryos can be analyzed microscopically to assess differentiation at the blastocyst stage of development. For example, in the case of transgenic murine embryos, the embryos can be assessed at approximately 48 and/or 96 hours after fertilization. In some aspects the methods can include an evaluation at 48 hours, which can be an early predictor of quality of development. For other mammalian embryos, the duration of time from fertilization to blastocyst development can vary depending upon the source of the embryos. For example, blastocyst development for human embryos typically occurs at Day 5. Embryonic viability is assessed based upon assessing or scoring embryo qualitative/quaniitative assessment of expression (e.g.. via fluorescence), and if desired also with an assessment of morphology. [0089] The acceptable threshold for optimal embryo growth is based on individual set criteria depending on culture conditions and test items. In some aspects, a control benchmark is run in parallel with the test culture medium in each test. For example, when new' medium is evaluated for use in an IVP environment, the medium is tested against a control medium which has been pre-determined to provide optimal growth conditions for embryos. New test culture medium is evaluated by assessing blastocyst development relative to the blastocyst development in the control medium. Assessment can include a qualitative comparison of the number of cultured embryos reaching the blastocyst stage in tire control medium as compared to the number of embryo reaching the same stage in the test medium. Acceptable quality control generally requires development of at least 80% blastocysts in the test medium in order for a product to pass the test. Additional growth parameters include the number of cells observed at the blastocyst stage in the control versus the test medium as well as the intensity and localization of fluorescence of the reporter gene in the transgenic blastocysts. As compared with the standard ΜΕΑ assay, where the blastocyst may look normal, the disclosed assay provides a more enhanced sensitivity to embryo development. The reporter gene operabiv linked to a pluripotcncy/viability marker (and/or regulatory region thereof) can be observed microscopically and provides a better delineation of gene expression in optimal, sub-optimal, and/or embryo toxic growth conditions. Acceptable limits may be determined, for example, as described in the Analysis of Embryo Development section above. 10090J In some aspects, assessment of the test product does not require comparison to a control product run in parallel. In some aspects, standardized criteria are used to determine whether the test product is acceptable. For example, expression (e.g., via fluorescence analysis) from blastocysts grown under test conditions at various stages may be compared to expression levels that correspond to optimal embryo growth. In some embodiments, the user easily can determine acceptable levels, e.g., based on previous experiments under simitar conditions. In some embodiments, the assay includes standards deemed acceptable. In some embodiments, acceptability limits are set by a regulatory agency or similar group. Acceptable limits may be determined, for example, as described in the Analysis of Embryo Development section above. (0091] A quality control assay for use in clinical ART to evaluate products used in the process of handling and preserving human gametes and producing, culturing and preserving human embryos is provided. The assay can include a transgenic one-cell embryo harvested from a transgenic mammal, wherein die transgenic embryo includes at least one reporter gene operably linked to at least one embryonic pluripotcncy marker. The pluripotcncy regulator can be a viability marker such as OCT-4, SOX2, Nanog, CDX2 as well as their upstream mediators and downstream effectors that play a role in ensuring normal embryo development. The reporter gene can encode a protein. The protein can include any reporter protein including, without limitation. Green Fluorescent Protein, Red Fluorescent Protein, Cyan Fluorescent Protein, Orange Fluorescent Protein, or Yellow Fluorescent Protein. The assay also includes instructions for evaluating ART products and IVF culture conditions. 'These instructions include directions relating to incubating a transgenic one-cell embryo under ART conditions and evaluating embryo development based upon morphology and/or gene expression (as determined by reporter gene expression) from the one and two-cell to later blastulation and gastrulation stages, incubation, as used herein, describes the process by which fertilized, one or two cell embryos are cultured for a predetermined amount of time, e.g, approximately 24-96 hours in a defined culture media, 10092] In one aspect, this invention relates to a quality control assay for use in assessing a media used for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART), the assay comprising: one or more transgenic embryos, wherein the embryos comprise at least one reporter gene operablv linked to the regulatory region of at least one embryonic viability marker; a control product, wherein the product allows tor optimal embryo growth; and instructions for evaluating ART products and 1VF culture conditions using the assay, In some embodiments, the control product is control medium. In some embodiments, the assay also includes suboptimal media, wherein the suboptima! media allows for suboptimal embryo growth. In some embodiments, the instructions include standards or guidelines for determining acceptability of the product to be tested for use in ART, 100931 Also disclosed is a molecular MRA kit for use in quality control of clinical human ART/fVF. The kit includes a transgenic one-cell embryo. The transgenic embryo includes at least one reporter gene operablv linked to at least the regulatory region of at least one gene associated with embryonic development; and an embryo expressing a transgeni℮/reporter gene that is differentially expressed under optimal and sub-optimal or embryo-toxic culture conditions. The kit further includes an ART/TVF consumable. An ART consumable can include, without limitation, embryo culture media, gamete handling media, enzymes for denuding oocytes, gradient for sperm separation, freezing media, thawing media, pipettes and embryo handling devices, lab-ware used in the process of human in vitro fertilization including but not limited to Petri dishes, centrifuge tubes, cryopreservation and cryostorage devices. EXAMPLES ]0094] Additional embodiments are disclosed in further detail in the following examples, which are not in any way intended to limit the scope of the claims. EXAMPLE 1: EVALUATION OF PURfPOTENCY REGULATORS [0095] Several [actors such as toxicity and sterility of the culture media or materials used in ART can affect development of embryos. The following examples describe assays to assess embryonic viability under optimal and sub-optimal culture conditions. Embryos in which pluripoteney regulators were visualized using a fluorescent microscope are shown. The pluripoteney markers used for assessing embryonic development from one or two cell stage of development include, for example. 80X2, Oct-4, Nanog as well as their upstream mediators and downstream effectors that play a role in ensuring normal embryo development. [0096) To test culture media, media additives, or ART consumables, the collected transgenic embryos are first incubated in 50 μΕ droplets of either control medium (medium which has already been determined to promote optimal blastocyst development) or test media, in each case the embryos are covered by mineral oil and incubated at 37 degrees C under classical cell culture conditions (humidified atmosphere of 5% C02 in air). On day 1, 2, and/or 3, embryos arc selected for assays and transferred in the medium to be tested. The embryos are cultivated until day 5. By comparing the rates of blastocysts stages reached versus control groups, a cytotoxic or sub-optimal effect can be identified which interferes with embryo development. a. Expression of OCT-4 in mouse embryo [0097] Figure 1 is a photograph from the fluorescence microscope showing expression of the pluripoteney regulator OCT-4 in early-stage mouse embryos. The 2-cell embryo was cultured in vitro in optimal (control) and suboptimai (test) conditions. After approximately 48 hours, the embryos were stained with an antibody specific for OCT-4 (red) and evaluated via fluorescence microscopy. (OCT-4 is also called OCT-3/4.) As is evident from Figure 1, the embryo on the left, which was incubated under optimal growth conditions, is well developed with uniform staining. By contrast, the blastocyst on the right was incubated in sub-optima! growth conditions. A lack of OCT-4 staining is observed on the right cell of the embryo on the right, demonstrating that the sub-optimal growth conditions result in slower embryonic development and reduced OCT-4 expression, even at an early stage of embryo development. b. Expression of OCT-4 in mouse blastocyst (0098] Figures 2Α and 2Β illustrate expression of OCT-4 at the blastocyst stage. The embryos were cultured in vitro for 96 hours, then stained with DAPI (blue nuclear stain, left image) and an anti-OCT-4 antibody (red, center image) and observed via a fluorescence microscope. The right image in each Figure represents a merged image of the DAP! and OCT-4 Images; overlap of staining is indicated in purple. In Figure 2Α, under optimal growth conditions, norma! embryo development is observed as demonstrated by the uniform OCT-4 staining. By contrast, in Figure 2Β, the embryos were incubated under sub-optimal growth conditions. A lack of OCT-4 staining on some mural trophectoderm cells is observed in the embryos, as noted by the arrows on figure 2Β. Without the use of the presently claimed technology, the sub-optimal culture conditions would not be evident or identifiable as sub-optimal when using the conventional ΜΕΑ standard Q€ protocol of morphological assessment because the blastocyst appears to be normal and developing at a normal rate. However, by observing the slow growth in Figure 2Β, it is clear that blastocyst development is qualitatively less uniform and less optimal than in the embryonic development and blastocyst differentiation observed in Figure 2Α. c. Expression of Sox2 in mouse blastocyst [0099] Figures 3Α, 3Β, and 3C demonstrate the expression pattern of Sox2 in embryos grown under optimal or suboptimal conditions. Figures 3A-3C are fluorescence microscopy photographs of control murine embryos. Embryos were incubated to the blastocyst stage in vitro, fixed, stained with DA PI (blue) and anti-Sox2 antibody (green), and observed microscopically. After 96 hours of culture, the image on the left of Figure 3A shows DAPI staining of the embryo. The center image in Figure 3A shows the staining pattern for the Sox2 viability marker, and the image on the right is a merged image. The staining pattern observed in the embryo is uniform and evidences normal, healthy blastocyst development under optimal conditions. Notice the uniform staining as well as the well-defined differentiation of the blastocyst. (00100] Turning to Figure 3Β, blastocysts incubated in sub-optimal growth conditions are observed. After 96 hours, the embryo was fixed and stained with DAPI (blue) and anti-Sox2 antibody (green), and observed microscopically to assess growth. The picture appears to demonstrate normal growth and development despite the sub-optimal culture conditions. f00101J Figure 3C shows two embryos stained with DAPI (blue) and anti-Sox2 antibody (green) with poor growth in suboptimal culture conditions. d.

EXAMPLE 2: MOLECULAR MOUSE EMBRYONIC ASSAY [00103] Transgenic mice containing a reporter gene linked to pluripolency marker(s) were used to carry out molecular-based mouse embryo assay (mMEA) under optimal and sub-optimal conditions. Transgenic male mice (B6;CBA-Tg(Pou5fi EGFP)2Mnn/J; Jackson Laboratory) expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the POU protein domain, class 5, transcription factor 1 (PouSfl, a.k.a. Oct-4) promoter and distal enhancer were used. [00104j Transgenic male mice were mated with super-ovulated wild type (B6D2F1) female mice. One-cell embryos were collected and cultured in groups of 3 to 4 embryos per 20 μℓ. drop of medium, or a single embryo per 10 μΕ drop of medium, depending on experiment performed. Embryos were cultured for 96 hours under optimal or sub-optimal conditions. Fluorescence indicates expression of the Oct-4-EGFP transgene. a. Comparison of morphological development and Oct-4 expression during embryo development jOOlOSJ One-cell embryos were cultured in groups of 3 ℓο 4 embryos per 20 μℓ. drop of medium under optimal and suboptimal conditions. Embryo development was assessed after 48 hours of culture using both light (stereoscope) and UV (inverted microscope with UV light) microscopy to check embryo morphology, determine developmental stage and evaluate levels of Oct-4 expression as a function of the fluorescence intensity of GFP. The same embryos were assessed by both methods. Embryo development as determined by light microscopy (Figure 5A) showed both 8-cell and < 8-ceil embryos, and fluorescence intensity (Figure 5Β) was characterized as low (no light to low light, 0-1) or high (medium to high light, 2-3). As shown in Figure 5Β, 8-cell embryos with normal morphology may have low expression of Oct-4 as demonstrated by the low intensity (arrow) of the 8-cell embryo. b. Correlation of fluorescence pattem/intensity with embryo development Analysis of multiple embryos [00106! One-cell embryos were collected and cultured in groups of 3 to 4 embryos per 20 μΕ drop of medium under optimal or suboptimal conditions. Blinded assessment of each group of embryos was performed at 48 hours by two evaluators: one evaluator determined the morphology of the group of embryos by light microscopy (stereoscope): the second evaluator determined the fluorescence intensity of the group of embryos. Another assessment of each group of embryos was done at 96 hours to determine blastocyst development. 100107j Figure 6Α indicates the percentage of groups of embryos with 8 cells or more (red: >8-cell) or less than 8 cells (blue: <8-cell) at 48 hours by morphology analysis by light microscopy. Figure 6Β indicates the percentage of embryos with the indicated fluorescence intensity (blue: fluorescence 0-1; red: fluorescence 2-3) at 48 hours. 0 = Νο fluorescence; 1 = low intensity; 2 ≈ medium intensity; 3 ≈ high intensity. Comparison of the two methods at 48 hours for the suboptimal condition showed that the morphologybased assay determined that 63.3% of the embryos had progressed to the 8-cell stage or beyond, in contrast to the fluorescence-based assay which determined that only 33.3% of the embryos had the desired (medium to hi) fluorescence intensity. The molecular ME A was more sensitive than the standard ΜΕΑ at an earlier stage for determining that the growth conditions were suboptimal. Figures 6C and 6D indicate the blastocyst development as determined by light microscopy (Figure 60) and fluorescent microscopy (Figure 6D) at 96 hours (blue: early blastocyst.; red; blastocyst; green: expanded blastocyst; purple: hatching blastocyst) was no different. Figure 6Ε indicates the correlation of fluorescence intensity at 48 hours with the blastocyst stage of the same embryo at 96 hours, as a percentage of blastocysts at a given stage that exhibited the indicated fluorescence at 48 hours (blue: no fluorescence; red: low intensity fluorescence; green; medium intensity fluorescence; purple; high intensity fluorescence), Good correlation was observed between early expression of OCT-4 (fluorescence) and progression to later stages of embryo development for individual embryos. Figure 7 indicates the distribution of embryos in optimal (blue line) and suboptimal (red line) culture conditions according to their fluorescence status, shown as the percent of embryos exhibiting each fluorescence intensity at 48 hours. EXAMPLE 3; MOLECULAR MOUSE EMBRYONIC ASSAY USED TO ASSESS BLASTOCYST DEVELOPMENT IN PRESENCE OF DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF OIL Transgenic mouse embryos containing CDX2-GFP were used to carry out molecular-based mouse embryo assay (ηχΜΕΑ) in the presence of different qualities of oil: (I) good oil, (2) 5% bad oil, (3) 7,5% bad oil, (4) 10% bad oil, and (5) 15% bad oil. Eighteen embryos were tested for each of the above-listed oil qualities. The embryos were evaluated using a stereo microscope to at 48 and 96 hours to assess morphologically blastocyst development, and also using a fluorescent microscope at 48 and 96 hours to assess expression ol'GFP. Using conventional ΜΕΑ protocols, any embryo scoring at or above 80% at 96 hr (expanded and hatching blastocysts) would pass such that the tested parameter would be deemed accessible. As shown below, the morphological analysis alone was not as sensitive as the molecular expression methodology and w'ould have resulted in one false positive for the 7.5% bad oil a. Morphological Evaluation of Development and Cdx-2 Expression at 48 Hours 100108) Figure 8A shows the early cleavage development of embryos for morphology assessment after 48 hours, specifically the percentage of embryos with less than 8 cells (blue) and those with greater than or equal to 8 cells (red). The Cdx-2 expression/ fluorescence intensity of the same embryos was also evaluated at 48 hr. Embryos were rated on a relative subjective scale of 0-3 for fluorescence with 0 meaning no fluorescence, 1 meaning low fluorescence, 2 meaning medium fluorescence, and 3 meaning high fluorescence. The percent of developing embryos rated as 0-1 (no or low fluorescence, blue) 2-3 (medium or high fluorescence, red) are shown in Figure SB. b. Morphological Evaluation of Development and Cdx-2 Expression at 96 Hours J00109J Figures 8C and 8D indicate the blastocyst development as determined by light microscopy (Figure 8C) and fluorescent microscopy (Figure 8D) at 96 hours (blue: early blastocyst; red: blastocyst; green: expanded blastocyst; purple: hatching blastocyst). As shown in Figure 8C, the “good oil," the “5% bad oil.’' and the “7.5% bad oil’’ all meet the 80% threshold using MBA or morphological analysis for being deemed acceptable. The 10% and 15% bad oils would have failed the 80% threshold. Evaluation of blastocysts specifically for fluorescence intensity at 96 hr does not distinguish the development differences between optimal and suboptimai conditions. Figure 8Ε indicates the distribution of embryos in the various treatment conditions according to their fluorescence status, shown as the number of embryos exhibiting each fluorescence intensity at 48 hours. Embryos were rated on a relative subjective scale of 0-3 for fluorescence with 0 meaning no fluorescence, 1 meaning low fluorescence, 2 meaning medium fluorescence, and 3 meaning high fluorescence. ℮. Discussion / Summary of Results [001101 Tables 1 and 2 below show that using only the morphological assessment would have led to a false positive for the 7.5% bad oil*. In contrast, the molecular ΜΕΑ identified the suboptimai development as early as 48 hours. As illustrated by the data in Table 2, using morphology alone, the 7.5% bad oil would have scored above the 80% cutoff, while the developmental expression of Cdx-2 demonstrated that those embryos were adversely affected by the 7.5% bad oil. This illustrates the increased sensitivity according to some embodiments provided by the molecular ΜΕΑ as described herein as compared to only visual morphological analysis.

Determination of Suboptimal Media Components !00111 j Transgenic mouse embryos containing a reporter gene linked to pluripoteney marker were incubated in 20 pL droplets of medium containing human scrum albumin (HSA) of differing quality. The embryos were covered by mineral oil and incubated at 37 degrees C under classical cell culture conditions (humidified atmosphere of 5% C02 in air). Embryos were evaluated morphologically and for expression of GFP after 48 and 96 hours in culture. [00112] At 48 h, the embryos were assessed by standard ΜΕΑ and molecular ΜΕΑ. The results are shown in Table 3. All of the USA samples gave similar results with the standard ME A (top panel), with 95.3% to 97.7% of the embryos progressing to the 8-cell stage or beyond in each condition. The molecular ΜΕΛ (lower panel) identified two USA samples (HSA-A and HSA-D) that exhibited a greater number of embryos with no to low fluorescence. ~ 15% Bad oil 5.6 ύ-7 below 4-cell 4 to 7-coii ; HSA-A : HSA-B 0.0 95.5 0.0 95.3 ; HSA-C 0,0 97.7 ; HSA-D 0.0 2.5 97.7 ; HSA-F Π Ρ ' . 4.7 : ■ Μ5,3 HSA-A !hsa-s No Fluorescence 0.0 low fluorescence 9.3 Med to Ms fluorescence SO. 7 I HSA-C I ^ 2.3 : 16.3 [00113] At 96 h, the embryos were assessed to determine the percentage of embryos in each stage. The results are shown in Table 4. HSA-B, HSA-C, and HSA-F allowed greater than 85% of the embryos to progress to the expanded blastocyst stage and beyond, which surpasses the requirements for allowable IVF culture media, HSA-D allowed 83.7% of the embryos to progress to the expanded blastocyst stage and beyond, which barely passes the requirements for allowable IVF culture media. HSA-A allowed only 72.7% of the embryos to progress to the expanded blastocyst stage and beyond, which fails the requirements lor allowable IVF culture media. The molecular ΜΕΑ identified the suboptima! culture conditions at an earlier stage (48 h) than the standard ME A.
