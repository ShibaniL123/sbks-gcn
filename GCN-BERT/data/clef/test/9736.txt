Novel substituted condensed pyrimidine compounds The present invention relates to novel substituted, condensed pyrimidine compounds and to their use as medicaments. It is known that certain pyrimidine compounds are suitable for inhibiting specific phosphodiesterases (abbreviated as PDEs). Phosphodiesterases, or more accurately 3',5'-cyclonucleotide phosphodiesterases, are enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of the second messengers cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) and cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) to 5'-AMP (5'-adenosine monophosphate) and 5'-GMP (5'-guanosine monophosphate). Inhibition of phosphodiesterases thus represents a mechanism for modulating cellular processes and can be used to alleviate or cure disease conditions. WO 95/01338 Al, for example, describes how suitable PDE inhibitors can be used to treat inflammatory respiratory diseases, dermatoses, and other proliferative, inflammatory and allergic skin diseases. WO 95/01338 Al proposes, moreover, that such PDE inhibitors can find application in the treatment of diseases that are based on an excess release of TNF and leukotrienes, for example diseases from the arthritis spectrum (rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatoid spondylitis, osteoarthritis and other arthritic conditions). The international publication proposes, furthermore, the use of suitable PDE inhibitors as medicaments for diseases of the immune system (e.g. AIDS), symptoms of shock, as well as generalised inflammations in the gastrointestinal system (e.g. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), diseases based on allergic and/or chronic, immunological adverse reactions in the upper respiratory tract (lateral pharyngeal space, nose) and adjacent regions (sinuses, eyes), such as for example allergic rhinitis/sinusitis, chronic rhinitis/sinusitis, allergic conjunctivitis and nasal polyps, but also diseases of the heart that can be treated by PDE inhibitors, such as for example heart failure, or diseases that can be treated because of the tissue-relaxing effect of PDE inhibitors, such as for example renal and ureteric colic in conjunction with kidney stones. Phosphodiesterases are a group of enzymes encompassing 11 gene families (PDE1-11), which differ inter alia through their affinity to cAMP and cGMP. The inhibition of the individual gene families with suitable substances is the subject of wide-ranging research. A known PDE5 inhibitor is sildenafil, which is commercially available under the trade name Viagra(TM) and which is used primarily for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The discovery that the second messenger cAMP plays an important role in many inflammatory processes and that PDE4 is strongly expressed in cells that control inflammation processes (see inter alia Schudt, C. et al. (1995). PDE isoenzymes as targets for anti-asthma drugs. European Respiratory Journal 8, 1179-1183), has led to the development of PDE4 inhibitors having an anti-inflammatory effect. One such PDE4 inhibitor having an anti-inflammatory effect is roflumilast for example (known under the trade name Daxas®), which was approved as a medicament for the treatment of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). In addition to the desired anti-inflammatory effect of roflumilast, however, side-effects such as for example nausea, diarrhoea and headaches are observed, which limit the dose in humans. Undesired side-effects in humans were observed with other PDE4 inhibitors too, so the therapeutic range (therapeutic window) of such medicaments is relatively narrow. The provision of PDE4 inhibitors having only little side-effects and a better therapeutic window would therefore be desirable. Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is cAMP-specific and encompasses 4 different subtypes (PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C and PDE4D). As is described below, efforts are being made to find subtype-selective PDE4 inhibitors, above all PDE4B-selective inhibitors, that have less severe or no side-effects, such that the therapeutic range of these compounds is increased significantly. The inhibition of PDE4D is associated with the occurrence of undesired side-effects, such as for example diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea (see in this regard Mori, F. et al. (2010). The human area postrema and other nuclei related to the emetic reflex express cAMP phosphodiesterases 4Β and 4D. Journal of Chemical Neuroanatomy 40, 36-42; Press, N.J.; Banner Κ. Η (2009).

(2002). 4D or not 4D - the emetogenic basis of PDE4 inhibitors uncovered? Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 23, 548). In an article entitled "Discovery of selective PDE4B inhibitors" published in Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 19 (2009) p.3174-3176, Kenji et al. disclose thirty-five pyrimidine compounds that exhibit PDE4B selectivity. Some of the compounds listed are said to show a 10-times higher inhibitory activity against PDE4B than against PDE4D. The compounds examined by Kenji et al. are substantially encompassed by the general formula described in US 2006/0293343Al. US 2006/0293343A1 discloses specific pharmaceutically effective PDE4-inhibiting pyrimidine compounds having an anti-inflammatory effect, of the following general formula: in which Ar1 is optionally substituted furyl, thienyl, triazolyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl or benzothiazolyl; Ε is a single bond or methylene; Ar21 is an optionally substituted phenyl or naphthyl; Ra and Rb in each case independently of one another is hydrogen or alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, thioalkyl, alkyl sulfinyl, alkyl sulfonyl, each of which can optionally be substituted; and Rc is hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl. In the article by Kenji et al. the authors describe the examination of various structure-activity relationships, discussing inter alia the influence of the substituents at the 5- and 6-position on the pyrimidine ring (the substituent at the 5-position corresponds to Rb in the general formula above, which was taken from US 2006/0293343Α1, and the substituent at the 6-position corresponds to Ra). It can be inferred from the article that when an allyl, ethyl, cyano or formyl radical is bound at the 5-position of the pyrimidine ring, highly effective, selective PDE4B compounds were obtained. If, however, a larger chemical group is present at the same position, the inhibitory activity of the tested compounds decreases. With regard to possible modifications of the substituents at the 6-position of the pyrimidine ring, the authors ascertain that if methyl is replaced with ethyl at this position, the activity of the compound increases and the selectivity is lowered. Thus the authors reason that changes at the 5- and/or 6-position of the pyrimidine ring influence the activity and the selectivity of the pyrimidine compound. The authors allude to steric effects, without however giving any further information as to how the selectivity can be influenced without losing inhibitory activity. In an unrevised article by Goto, Τ. et al. Bioorg. Med.Chem.Lett. (2013) entitled "Identification of the fused bicyclic 4-amino-2-phenylpyrimidine derivatives as novel and potent PDE4 inhibitors, which has been published online on April 3, 2013, and which is now published in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 23 (2013) 3325-3328, several fused bicyclic compounds are described having a PDE4B inhibiting activity. Some compounds given in this article are represented by the following formula: Based on the prior art the object of the present invention was to find compounds that are preferably PDE4B-selective (i.e. to find active compounds or compositions that with a particular amount of active ingredient inhibit PDE4B without inhibiting or only weakly inhibiting the PDE4D subtype). The advantage of such a PDE4B selectivity, as mentioned above, is that various side-effects do not occur or occur only to a small extent and that therefore a greater therapeutic range (= therapeutic window) of the pharmaceutical active ingredient is obtained. The therapeutic range of a pharmaceutical active ingredient or medicament describes the d between its therapeutic dose and a dose that would lead to a toxic or undesired effect. The greater the therapeutic range, the rarer or more unlikely the occurrence of certain toxic or undesired side-effects and hence the safer and more tolerable the pharmaceutical active ingredient or medicament. The therapeutic range is often also referred to as the therapeutic window or therapeutic index. These names are used synonymously in the present application. The inventors have now found pyrimidine compounds that display the desired inhibiting and PDE4B-selective property and are superior to the corresponding pyrimidine compounds of the prior art. They are therefore particularly suitable for the treatment of diseases and conditions in which inhibition of the PDE4 enzyme, in particular the PDE4B enzyme, is advantageous.

The invention relates furthermore to a method (01) for producing a compound according to the invention of general formula (XX) and (XXI), respectively in which Q is Q1 and Τ is oxygen (if η=1 then the target compound corresponds to a compound of formula (XX-G) and (XXI-G), respectively and if η=2 then the target compound corresponds to a compound of formula (ΧΧ-Η) and (XXI-H), respectively, encompassing the following steps: Step (i): Reaction of an amidine compound of general formula (II) with a β^℮ΐο ester of general formula (III) or (Ill-a) to form a 4-hydroxypyrimidine compound of formula (IV) or (Vl-a) G NH2 X + ΝΗ Km (HI) Step (i) (II) ΑΛ f\- S(0)x in a solvent such as for example ethanol, n-propanol, iso-propanol or dimethylformamide and in the presence of a base (e.g. sodium ethanolate, caesium carbonate or N,N-diisopropylethylamine (so-called Hunig base) at a temperature in the range from approximately 0°C to approximately 130°C; Step (ii): Chlorination of the 4-hydroxypyrimidine compound of formula (IV) or (IV-a) with a chlorinating agent to form a compound (V) or (V-a) in a solvent, wherein the chlorinating agent can be phosphorus oxychloride; Step (iii): Reaction of the 4-chloropyrimidine compound of formula (V) or (V-a) with a phenol of formula (VI) to form a compound of formula (VII) or (VH-a) N^f 'n G^NT "Cl Η℮Τ^χ l-co2r step (iii) Km r\-\ νΛΛ r^vl-c°2R rANJsXJ G Ν O (V) (VI) (VII) Km 50)x + :i ηο^^χ l-co2r step (iii) Km rt'S(0)χ ,,ΛΛ G Ν O ^χ (V-a) (VI) (VH-a) in a solvent and optionally in the presence of a base; Step (iv): Acid or basic ester cleavage of the compound of formula (VII) or (Vll-a) to form the target compound of formula (XX) or (XXI) in an organic solvent, which can contain water. Step (i) of method (01), namely the reaction of an amidine compound of general formula (II) with a βketo ester of general formula (III) or (Ill-a) to form a 4-hydroxypyrimidine compound of formula (IV) or (IV-a), is a condensation reaction. The P-keto ester of general formula (III) or (Ill-a) can also be present in the tautomeric enol form. Condensation reactions are generally known (see for example Chemistry - A European Journal 2008, 14, 6836 - 6844). Step (ii) of method (01) is a generally known method by which the hydroxyl group of the 4-hydroxypyrimidine of general formula (IV) or (IV-a) can be chlorinated by standard methods (see for example Journal of the Chemical Society 1951, 1218-1221; Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 2010, 18, 2704-2712). For example, compounds of general formula (V) and (V-a), respectively can be produced by reacting a 4-hydroxypyrimidine of general formula (IV) and (IV-a), respectively with phosphorus oxychloride at a temperature in the range from approximately 20°C to approximately 100°C, preferably at a temperature in the range from approximately 50°C to approximately 100°C. Step (iii) of method (01), namely the reaction of the 4-chloropyrimidine compounds of general formula (V) and (V-a), respectively with the corresponding phenols of general formula (VI) to form the compounds of general formula (VII) and (VH-a), respectively takes place by standard methods in a solvent and optionally in the presence of a base. Suitable solvents are known to the person skilled in the art. Examples of such solvents are dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide. Examples of suitable bases are l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), triethylamine, sodium hydroxide solution and caesium or potassium carbonate. The reaction can take place at a temperature in the range from approximately 20°C to approximately 200°C. The reaction preferably takes place at a temperature in the range from 50°C to 130°C. The ester cleavage (ester hydrolysis) in step (iv) of method (01) takes place by known methods. Ester cleavages are described for example by P.G.M. Wuts, T.W. Greene in Greene’s Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th Edition, 2007, pages 538-616, Wiley-Interscience. They can be performed hydrolytically, for example, in the presence of acids or bases (e.g. alkali hydroxides such as for example lithium or sodium hydroxide) in an organic solvent to which varying proportions of water can be added. Other frequently used methods of ester cleavage involve the acid-catalysed cleavage of a tert-butyl ester (R = tert-butyl) by generally known methods, for example using trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane, or the hydrogenolysis of benzyl esters. For the preparation of compounds of formula (XXI), it is favorable to use in step (i) starting materials of formula (Ill-a) wherein χ is 0 and to convert the resulting compounds by an oxidation reaction to the corresponding compounds wherein χ is 1 or 2.

Human recombinant enzyme, expressed in Sf9 cells, and the HTRF (homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence) detection method were used in the assay. The test compound or water (control) was mixed with the human recombinant PDE4B1 enzyme (4.8 U) in a buffer consisting of 44.4 mM tris-HCl, 5.28 mM MgC12, 2.64 mM DTT and 0.044% Tween 20 (pH 7.8). After adding the cAMP enzyme substrate (final concentration 40 ηΜ) the mixture was incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then a fluorescence acceptor (Dye2 marked with cAMP), a fluorescence donor (anti-cAMP antibody marked with a europium cryptate) and the non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; final concentration 1 mM) were added. After 60 minutes the fluorescence transfer, which correlates with the amount of remaining cAMP, was measured with a microplate reader (Rubystar, BMG) at λ℮χ = 337 nm, λ℮πΐ = 620 nm and λ℮ΐη = 665 nm. The enzyme activity was calculated from the quotient formed from the measured signal at 665 nm and that at 620 nm.
