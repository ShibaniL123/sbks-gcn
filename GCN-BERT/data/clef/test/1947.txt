BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present application relates to a process for preparation of leuprolide and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. 2. Description of the Related Art Leuprorelin or leuprolide acetate belongs to a family of drugs called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues. It is a synthetic nonapeptide analog which acts as an agonist at pituitary GnRH receptors. The chemical name is 5-oxo-L-prolyl-L-histidyl-L-tryptophyl-L-seryl-L-tyrosyl-D-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-arginyl-N-ethyl-L-prolinamide acetate (salt) and its primary sequence is Pyr-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-D-Leu-Leu-Arg-Pro-NHEt. It may be utilized in the treatment of hormone-responsive cancer such as prostate or breast cancer, estrogen-dependent conditions, such as endometriosis or utrine fibroids, and to control precocious puberty. Leuprolide acetate is marketed as Viadur by Bayer AG, as Eligard by Sanofi-Aventis and as Lupron by Takeda Abbott Pharmaceuticals (TAP) in the United States. Recently some syntheses utilized for preparing leuprolide or leuprolide acetate were disclosed in EP 2,119,725A1, WO 2008/44890A1 and WO 2011/148384A1. European Patent Application EP 2,119,725A1 describes a method of preparing a peptide which is a C-terminal amide derivative, which comprises providing an amino acid attached in its C-terminal to a super-acid labile resin; coupling said amino acid with another amino acid in the presence of a coupling reagent; repeating the coupling step to obtain a peptide, wherein the peptide is protected with at least one protecting group which remains on the peptide upon its cleavage from the resin; cleaving said protected peptide from the resin by admixing with a mild acidic solution; and amidating the obtained protected peptide with a suitable amine. FIG. 1 illustrates the route to leuprolide disclosed in EP 2,119,725A1. The preparation of leuprolide precursor [Pyr-His(Trt)-Trp-Ser(tBu)-Tyr(tBu)-D-Leu-Leu-Arg(Pbf)-Pro-OH] is cleaved from the resin by admixing a 1% TFA in DCM. Although the applicant emphasizes the process is performed under mild condition, the protecting groups of the leuprolide precursor and the super-acid labile resin cannot be removed to obtain the leuprolide precursor simultaneously. Thus, such a process inevitably needs to increase additional operations. Disadvantages of the process include resulting in a more tedious process of preparing leuprolide and other costly work-up procedures required at additional steps. Besides, since it is difficult to cleave the leuprolide precursor from a general acid-labile resin with a mild acidic solution, the process for preparing leuprolide is limited to the use of a super-acid labile resin. Furthermore, it is noted that the leuprolide precursor is prepared by coupling a crude peptide cleaved from the super acid-labile resin, and the coupling reaction involves the addition of TBTU/HOBT in the activation of carboxyl group of the peptide. However, HOBT is explosive and not suitable for performing the preparation. Therefore, the method does not have the excellent applicability in terms of the preparation of leuprolide. Another route, disclosed in WO 20111148384A1 and shown in FIG. 2, which relates to a process for the preparation of leuprolide or its pharmaceutical acceptable salts thereof by synthesizing the peptide fragments by solid phase [7 and 5 amino acids fragment, i.e., Pyr-His(Trt)-Trp(Boc)-Ser(tBu)-D-Leu-Leu-OH and Pyr-His(Trt)-Trp(Boc)-Ser(tBu)-Tyr(tBu)-OH] and solution phase [2 and 4 amino acids fragment, i.e., H-Arg(Pbf)-Pro-NHEt and H-D-Leu-Leu-Arg(Pbf)-Pro-NHEt] respectively. The final solution phase condensation of these peptide fragments (7+2 and 5+4) led to a nonapeptide leuprolide in the protected form, i.e., Pyr-His(Trt)-Trp(Boc)-Ser(tBu)-D-Leu-Leu-Arg(Pbf)-Pro-NHEt. The protected nonapeptide leuprolide is deprotected to obtained leuprolide, and then leuprolide can be converted into pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Disadvantages of this processes include the synthesis of the materials H-Arg(Pbf)-Pro-NHEt and H-D-Leu-Leu-Arg(Pbf)-Pro-NHEt involves the use of the expensive material, i.e., Pro-NH—CH2CH3. Besides, the cleavage of the 7 and 5 amino acids fragment from the super acid-labile resin is carried out by using 1% TFA in DCM, which is similar to the method disclosed in EP 2,119,725A1. Therefore, there is the same deficiency that the protecting groups of the 7 and 5 amino acids fragment and the super-acid labile resin cannot be simultaneously removed to obtain a leuprolide precursor. Such a process inevitably needs to increase additional operations. Disadvantages of the process include resulting in a more tedious process of preparing leuprolide and other costly work-up procedures required at additional steps. As above, the process for preparing leuprolide is limited to the use of a super-acid labile resin but not suitable for using a general acid-labile resin. Furthermore, it is noted that the protected nonapeptide leuprolide is prepared by coupling the 7 and 5 amino acids fragment cleaved from the super acid-labile resin with the 2 and 4 amino acid fragments, and the coupling reaction involves the addition of HBTU/6-CI-HOBT/DIEA in the activation of carboxyl group of the peptide. However, actually HOBT is explosive and not suitable for performing the coupling reaction. Therefore, the method does not have the excellent applicability in terms of the preparation of leuprolide. Yet another route, disclosed in WO 2008/44890A1 and shown in FIG. 3, which includes using a super acid-labile resin in the SPPS to prepare a leuprolide derivative, i.e., Pyr-His-Try-Ser(Bzl)-Tyr(Bzl)-D-Leu-Leu-Arg(NO2) which is obtained by adding weak acidic cleavage solution such as 2%-50% TFA/DCM, then the leuprolide precursor is reacted with Pro-NH—CH2CH3 to obtain Pyr-His-Try-Ser(Bzl)-Tyr(Bzl)-D-Leu-Leu-Arg(NO2)-Pro-NH—CH2CH3, and then the side-chain protecting groups are removed through catalytic hydrogen transfer reaction using by Pd/C and cyclohexadiene etc. Disadvantages of this process include the material Pro-NH—CH2CH3 is expensive and the hydrogenation reaction utilized for removing the side-chain protecting groups is also unsafe. As such, there is a strong demand for a convenient process that is suitable for preparation of leuprolide or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts on a commercial scale with high purity and without complicated and costly purification steps. The present invention addresses this and other needs. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for preparing leuprolide and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts by the combination of solid and solution phase peptide synthesis. The method comprises: providing an amino acid derivative attached in its C-terminal to an acid-labile resin, wherein all side chains of said amino acid derivative are protected; cleaving all protecting groups of said amino acid derivative and said resin by reacting with an suitable acidic solution to obtain an deprotected leuprolide precursor; amidating the deprotected leuprolide precursor with a suitable amine in the presence of a coupling reagent to obtain leuprolide, and then optionally converting leuprolide into its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The various features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of the disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages, and specific objects attained by its use, reference should be had to the drawing and descriptive matter in which there are illustrated and described preferred embodiments of the invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENTLY PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention provides a novel, efficient, safe and easily operating method for preparing leuprolide and its pharmaceutical acceptable salts by the combination of solid and solution phase synthesis. The method comprises providing an amino acid derivative attached in its C-terminal to an acid-labile resin, wherein all side chains of said amino acid derivative are protected; then cleaving all protecting groups of said amino acid derivative and said resin by reacting with an suitable acidic solution to obtain an deprotected leuprolide precursor; and then amidating the deprotected leuprolide precursor with a suitable amine in the presence of a coupling reagent. Subsequently, the crude product was purified by reverse phase HPLC to obtain fractions containing desired leuprolide salt at a purity of more than 99% (UPLC). According to the present invention, the amino acid derivative attached in its C-terminal to an acid-labile resin is prepared by providing an protected amino acid, attached in its C-terminal to an acid-labile resin; coupling the first protected amino acid with a second protected amino acid in the presence of a coupling reagent to obtain an amino acid fragment, and then coupling obtained fragment with another protected amino acid in the same way, step-by-step, to provide the amino acid derivative attached in its C-terminal to an acid-labile resin. Advantageously, the present invention provides a concise synthetic route to prepare leuprolide and its pharmaceutical acceptable salts. In some embodiments, several acid labile resins can be utilized in the present invention; in contrast with other prior art methods that can only employ a specific resin, in particular super acid-labile resin. In addition, the present invention reduces the steps of synthesizing leuprolide. Surprisingly, it is noted that the amidation of the deprotected leuprolide precursor in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent and a specific molar equivalent of ethylamine can provide a high yield and high purity of the final product. Accordingly, the present invention avoids a tedious process as disclosed in the prior art and is more suitable for a large-scale production of leuprolide and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. As utilized herein, the term “coupling reagent” refers to the reagent utilized for the activation of the carboxy group of the protected or deprotected peptide fragment. As utilized herein, the term “suitable acidic solution” refers to a solution comprising an acid in an inert organic solvent, in a concentration such that the protecting groups are enough to be removed during the cleavage of the peptide from the resin. As utilized herein, the term “protecting group” refers to a moiety that is formed to render a functional moiety unreactive. The protecting group can be removed so as to restore the functional moiety to its original state. Various protecting groups and protecting reagents, including hydroxy protecting groups, are well known to one of ordinary skill in the art and include compounds that are disclosed in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th edition, T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 2006, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. One embodiment of the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of leuprolide or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts by providing an amino acid derivative attached in its C-terminal to an acid-labile resin, wherein all side chains of said amino acid derivative are protected; cleaving all protecting groups of said amino acid derivative and said resin by reacting with an suitable acidic solution to obtain an deprotected leuprolide precursor; amidating the deprotected leuprolide precursor with a specific equivalent of ethyl amine in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent to obtain leuprolide, and then optionally converting leuprolide into its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In accordance with the invention, the coupling reagent utilized in the amidation step is selected from the group consisting of N,N′-Diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDCI) and benzotriazol-1-yl-oxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP). Optionally, the acid-labile resin comprises general acid-labile resin, such as para-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (PHB) resin (e.g. Wang resin) and 4-hydroxymethylphenoxyacetyl (HMPA) resin (e.g. HMPA-NovaGel™), etc. and super-acid labile resin, such as 2-chlorotrityl chloride (2-CTC) resin, 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-hydroxymethyl)-phenoxy resin (Rink acid resin) and 4-hydroxymethyl-3-methoxyphenoxybutyric acid (HMPB) resin (e.g. HMPB-MBNA resin), etc. Preferably, the suitable acidic solution utilized for obtaining is a solution comprising at least 80 volume % of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Before the amidation step, preferably the deprotected leuprolide precursor is isolated. Optionally, the isolation is by precipitation, crystallization, extraction, or chromatography. Preferably, the isolation is by precipitation. According to the present invention, the deprotected leuprolide precursor cleaved from the resin is an amino acid derivative having the sequence of: Pyr-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-D-Leu-Leu-Arg-Pro-OH. The amidation step comprises reacting the deprotected leuprolide precursor with ethyl amine in water in the presence of a coupling reagent to obtain leuprolide having the sequence of: Pyr-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-D-Leu-Leu-Arg-Pro-NHEt (See Scheme 1), and then optionally converting leuprolide into its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The inventive process utilizes an excess equivalent of ethyl amine to react with the deprotected leuprolide precursor in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent to obtain leuprolide. Surprisingly, it is noted that although the use of an excess equivalent of ethyl amine can induce a major side product of “M+239” shown in Scheme 1, controlling the excess equivalent not more than 7 equivalents can control “M+239” to less than 1% and thus providing a high yield and high purity of leuprolide. See the Table A as shown below. TABLES A Amidation condition and “M + 239” content PyBOP Ethylamine % of “M + 239” by HPLC 1.8 eq 5 eq <1% 2.3 eq 5 eq <1% 1.5 eq 6 eq <1% 1.8 eq 7 eq <1% 1.4 eq 10 eq 4% 1.9 eq 10 eq 5% In some embodiments, the inventive process reacts the deprotected leuprolide precursor with a specific equivalent of 70 wt % ethyl amine aqueous solution in the presence of a suitable coupling reagent to obtain leuprolide, wherein the specific equivalent of about 70 wt % ethyl amine is preferably not more than about 10 equivalents, more preferably not more than about 7 equivalents in comparison with the equivalent of the deprotected leuprolide precursor. In some embodiments, the inventive process utilizes a suitable coupling reagent to treat the coupling reaction between the deprotected leuprolide precursor and ethyl amine, wherein the suitable coupling reagent is PyBOP, and preferably the amount of the suitable coupling reagent is in a range of 1˜2 equivalents in comparison with the equivalent of the deprotected leuprolide precursor. One of skill in the art will appreciate that still other coupling reagents may be useful in the inventive process. The inventive process comprises providing a protected amino acid, attached in its C-terminal to an acid-labile resin; coupling said protected amino acid with another protected amino acids step by step in the presence of an coupling reagent to obtain a amino acid derivative attached in its C-terminal to an acid-labile resin. In some embodiments, the coupling reagent utilized for step by step preparing the protected amino acid derivative attached in its C-terminal to an acid-labile resin is selected from O-Benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-uronium-hexafluoro-phosphate (HBTU)/N-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate (HOBT hydrate), or 3-(diethoxy-phosphoryloxy)-3H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazin-4-one (DEPBT). Optionally, the coupling reactions of preparing the protected amino acid derivative attached in its C-terminal to an acid-labile resin comprises adding a base.
