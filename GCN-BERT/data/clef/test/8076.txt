3-[4-(4-aminopiperidin-1-yl)-7-chloro-3-(3-fluoro-5-methylphenyl)cinnolin-6-yl]-5-fluorobenzamide (Compound No. 1-4)
Step 1-1, preparation of 1-(2-amino-5-bromo-4-chloro-phenyl)-2-(3-fluoro-5-methyl-phenyl)-ethanone: To a solution of 1M-BCl3 (17.2 mL, 18 mmol, in DCM) in DCE (30 mL) was added 4-Bromo-3-chloro-phenylamine (3.5 g, 16.9 mmol) under ice-cooling. After stirring for 30 min, the mixture was sequentially treated with (3-Fluoro-5-methyl-phenyl)-acetonitrile (5.0 g, 42 mmol) and AlCl3 (2.5 g, 18 mmol). The reaction was refluxed for 2 days and cooled down to room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 2N-HCl (16 mL) and stirred for 1 h at 80° C. The reaction was extracted with DCM (2×), and the combined organic layers were dried with anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography to afford the title compound (1.8 g, 30%). MS (M+H)+=356.1
