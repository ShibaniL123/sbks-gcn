This invention provides a putter with a Plain, Circular, Vertical and Smooth face, according to claim 1. It is in the configuration of this face where the technique of contact with the ball lies. Furthermore, the transition of the sole to the face (slope) is not susceptible to friction when sliding across the green. United States Patent Number 6,155,933 is directed to a putter in which the frontal surface of the club head is curved both horizontally and vertically. With a Plain, Straight, Vertical and Smooth-faced putter, the face's configuration calls for contacting the ball in the same manner at all times; however, the edge/corner of the sole with the face is more susceptible to friction when moving across the green. Due to the nature of a ball's surface, contact with a putt's face is not always limited to a single point. It can take on different forms, regardless of the face's geometrical form. While a straight face stretches out horizontally, a curvilinear face stretches out vertically. This does not cause any deviation in trajectory, unlike the case with a straight-faced putt. The ball's movement is the result of a strike perpendicular to the rolling axis, which is more directional should the point of contact with the putt be less. A circular configuration corrects the "openness" or closure of the putt when swinging since the strike is always done in the direction of the face's radius. Its deviation from the line decreases accordingly. This being, it influences the ball's course, closing in on the line of putt previously chosen. It should be duly noted that, at any point on the circular putter, does its impact on the ball produce any effects on the ball's rotation, whether at the beginning of the stroke, during the ball's trajectory or even at the end of its course. The movement is only that of rolling. The scale on the Crown (1) shown on the Face (2) is symmetrical in regards to the putt's axis, having an interval of 0°-20° according to the radius of the putt's face. For the same angle, the amplitude is proportional to the variation of the radius. Therefore, the graded scale is reduced to 0° (zero degrees) when the face becomes straight. With this putt, the player is always aligned with the direction of the hole and the line of putt is defined by the position of the putt's face perpendicular to the player's plane. Here, the ball's axis coincides with the graduation of the putt's crown indicating the desired line. The Circular, Plain, Vertical, Smooth and Graded-faced Golf Putter can always be used as a common straight, plain, vertical, smooth-faced putter. The fundamental difference between a Plain, Straight-Faced Putter and a Plain Circular Putter is as follows: a) With a Plain Straight-Faced Putter, the line of putt is defined by the player who adjusts his alignment.b) With a Plain Circular-Faced Putter, the player is always in alignment with the hole, despite the line of putt being defined by the position of the putter's head perpendicular to the player's plane. The philosophy is: 1 If the hole is on a leveled or inclined plain and the line of putt is inline with the hole, the player's alignment and the putter's axis coincide with that line. The stroke is carried out with a swinging movement, using the necessary force, in the same manner as with a normal putter.2 If the hole is positioned on the green so that its line of putt lies to its right or to its left, the player's alignment and the putter's axis are inline with the hole. The line of putt is corrected by the putter's circular head, solely by moving the axis in the direction perpendicular to the player's alignment. It is the positioning of the putter to either side of the ball's axis that allows one to find the angle indicating the line of putt. Afterwards, all that is needed is to swing and strike the ball as if using a normal putter. When the inclination is to the right of the hole, the line of putt is corrected by moving the putter's axis perpendicularly to the player's plane and in its direction. If the inclination is to the left of the hole, the line of putt is corrected by moving the putter's axis perpendicularly to the player's plane and in the opposite direction. When comparing a traditional putt to a circular-faced putt under the same conditions (moisture content of the green, synthetic green, etc.) the following is noted: With a circular-faced putter, a Slope (7) of 45° at the transition point between the Sole (3) and the Face (2) facilitates the sliding of the putt across the green. Meanwhile, with a straight-faced putt, the edge/corner of the sole and the face causes more friction when doing the same. On the overgreen, the space between the rough and the green, this putter is more efficient than a traditional putter since its slope is of utmost importance for sliding on this surface. The invention is best understood with the aid of annexed drawings, among which: Figure 1 is a side view of the golf putter for the Plain, Circular, Vertical, Smooth and Graded Putter.Figure 2 is the Mold for this golf putter depicting the Crown (1) with a graded Scale (8) between 0° to 20°, Face (2), Back (4), Sole (3), Toe (5), Heel (6) and Slope (7)(Figure A), Neck/Socket (9) and the Shaft (10).Figure 3 is the same as above but the radius of the face has changed as has the respective scale from 0°-20° to 0°-15°. The dimensions presented in this figure are different from those in the Mold because this is considered the Base Model of this golf putter (the Base Model will be described later on);In Figure 4, all the characteristics of the Base Model (Figure 3) are maintained, having only changed the face's radius and the respective scale from 0°-15° to 0°-10°;In Figure 5, all the characteristics of the Base Model (Figure 3) are maintained, having only changed the face's radius and the respective scale from 0°-15° to 0°-5°; Initially, a face radius of 7xϕ was considered as the starting point for the scale 0°-20°. This is conditioned by the variation of radiuses within the face's limits, so as that the impact on the ball is in the intended direction. As can be seen in Figure 2, the degree scale for the Plain Circular Faced-Putter varies. In this drawing, its limits are 0°-20° symmetrically to the putter's axis. In Figures 3, 4 and 5, the degree scale is reduced until reaching the maximum scale of 0°-5°, in accordance with the increase of the face's radius. This being, the putter's dimensions (Figure 2: Mold - Scale 1/200), which were calculated using the proportional value of (phi)ϕ=1.618 converted into millimeters(mm), are: L= 7xϕ (113.26mm) (length)a= 2xϕ (32.36mm) (width)b= 2xϕ (32.36mm) (height)R= 7xϕ (113.26mm) (Face)R= 14xϕ (226.52mm) (Elliptical Sole)R= 2.7xϕ (43.68mm) (joining of the sole (3) with the toe(5) and heel (6))α= 45° Slope (transition of the sole (3) to the circular face (2))β= 5° Angle of the Sole (3) In this Figure, the Putter description consists of the following: CROWN (1) - Plain, Circular and Graded (0°-20°)FACE (2) - Plain, Circular, Vertical and SmoothSOLE (3) - EllipticalBACK (4) - Plain and VerticalTOE (5) - Plain and VerticalHEEL (6) - Plain and VerticalSLOPE (7) - Plain (45°)SCALE (8) - 0°-20°NECK/SOCKET (9) - Circular 0 14mm and rectangular 10x8mm, 20mm from the heelSHAFT (10) - Section variable to 14° vertically Based on the Mold (Figure 2) and in keeping with the parameters established by the rules for the Design of Cubs1 that do not allow such proportions, a Base Model (Figure 3) was created with the following dimensions: L= 120.00mm (length)a= 30.00mm (width)b= 30.00mm (height)1 Appendix II - Design of Clubs; Number 4 - Clubhead; Article b - Dimensions and Size; Page 160 For any option, the only variables are: the Face's Radius (R), the concordant radius (r), and the degree scale. Three Examples are provided to depict how the face's radius influences the variations in the degree scale. In Figure 3, the Radius (R)=165.00mm permits a symmetrical scale between 0°-15°.In Figure 4, the Radius (R)=250.00mm permits a symmetrical scale between 0°-10°In Figure 5, the Radius (R)=300.00mm permits a symmetrical scale between 0°-5°. Within the limits between the Base Model (figure 2) and the Plain Straight-Faced Putter, various face radiuses are possible. It can therefore be concluded that the variation of the face's radius is proportional to the amplitude. It increases the correction of the trajectory as it lessens. A radius of 300.00mm is close to the maximum limit for the transition of the Plain Circular-Faced Putter to the Plain Straight-Faced Putter. Therefore, the angles are maintained but the projection in the face's perimeters (amplitude) is greater as the radius increases. As the Radius of the Putt's Face decreases, the degree of precision increases. All that is described here was tested and proven through the use of a prototype that was constructed to be used with different face radiuses. The possibilities for industrial application are vast since manufacturing can be done for the most varied face and sole radiuses. There is also the possibility of constructing a model in which the face can be substituted according to the desired radius and degree of difficulty/challenge.
