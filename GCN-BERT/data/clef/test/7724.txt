BACKGROUND Metathesis is a catalytic reaction generally known in the art that involves the interchange of alkylidene units among compounds containing one or more double bonds (e.g., olefinic compounds) via the formation and cleavage of the carbon-carbon double bonds. Metathesis may occur between two like molecules (often referred to as self-metathesis) and/or it may occur between two different molecules (often referred to as cross-metathesis). Self-metathesis may be represented schematically as shown in Equation I. [in-line-formulae]R1—CH═CH—R2+R1—CH═CH—R2R1—CH═CH—R1+R2—CH═CH—R2 (I)[/in-line-formulae] wherein R1 and R2 are organic groups. Cross-metathesis may be represented schematically as shown in Equation II. [in-line-formulae]R1—CH═CH—R2+R3—CH═CH—R4R1—CH═CH—R3+R1—CH═CH—R4+R2—CH═CH—R3+R2—CH═CH—R4+R1—CH═CH—R1+R2—CH═CH—R2+R3—CH═CH—R3+R4—CH═CH—R4 (II)[/in-line-formulae] wherein R1, R2, R3, and R4 are organic groups. In recent years, there has been an increased demand for environmentally friendly techniques for manufacturing materials typically derived from petroleum sources. For example, researchers have been studying the feasibility of manufacturing biofuels, waxes, plastics, and the like, using natural oil feedstocks, such as vegetable and seed-based oils. In one non-limiting example, metathesis catalysts are used to manufacture candle wax, as described in PCT/US2006/000822, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Metathesis reactions involving natural oil feedstocks offer promising solutions for today and for the future. Natural oil feedstocks of interest include non-limiting examples such as natural oils (e.g., vegetable oils, fish oil, animal fats) and derivatives of natural oils, such as fatty acids and fatty acid alkyl (e.g., methyl) esters. These feedstocks may be converted into industrially useful chemicals (e.g., waxes, plastics, cosmetics, biofuels, etc.) by any number of different metathesis reactions. Significant reaction classes include, as non-limiting examples, self-metathesis, cross-metathesis with olefins, and ring-opening metathesis reactions. Representative non-limiting examples of useful metathesis catalysts are provided below. Metathesis catalysts can be expensive and, therefore, it is desirable to improve the efficiency of the metathesis catalyst. In recent years, there has been an increased demand for petroleum-based transportation fuels. Concerns exist that the world's petroleum production may not be able to keep up with demand. Additionally, the increased demand for petroleum-based fuels has resulted in a higher production of greenhouse gases. In particular, the airline industry accounts for greater than 10% of the greenhouse gases within the United States. Due to the increased demand for fuel and increased production of greenhouse gases, there is a need to explore methods of producing environmentally-friendly, alternative fuel sources. In particular, there is a need to explore methods of producing environmentally friendly fuel compositions and specialty chemicals from a natural feedstock, including monounsaturated olefin compounds.

As used herein, the terms “paraffin” and “paraffins” may refer to hydrocarbon compounds having only single carbon-carbon bonds, having the general formula CnH2n+2, where, in certain embodiments, n is less than about 20. As used herein, the terms “isomerization,” “isomerizes,” or “isomerizing” may refer to the reaction and conversion of straight-chain hydrocarbon compounds, such as normal paraffins, into branched hydrocarbon compounds, such as iso-paraffins. In other embodiments, the isomerization of an olefin or an unsaturated ester indicates the shift of the carbon-carbon double bond to another location in the molecule (e.g., conversion from 9-decenoic acid to 8-decenoic acid), or it indicates a change in the geometry of the compound at the carbon-carbon double bond (e.g., cis to trans). As a non-limiting example, n-pentane may be isomerized into a mixture of n-pentane, 2-methylbutane, and 2,2-dimethylpropane.

As used herein, the terms “fuels” and “fuel compositions” refer to materials meeting required specifications or to blend components that are useful in formulating fuel compositions but, by themselves, do not meet all of the required specifications for a fuel. As used herein, the term “carbon number distribution” may refer to the range of compounds present in a composition, wherein each compound is defined by the number of carbon atoms present. As a non-limiting example, a naphtha-type jet fuel typically comprises a distribution of hydrocarbon compounds wherein a majority of those compounds have between 5 and 15 carbon atoms each. A kerosene-type jet fuel typically comprises a distribution of hydrocarbon compounds wherein a majority of those compounds have between 8 and 16 carbon atoms each.

As used herein, the terms “conversion” and “conversion rate” may refer to the conversion from polyunsaturated olefins and/or esters into saturated esters, paraffins, monounsaturated olefins, and/or monounsaturated esters. In other words, conversion=(total polyunsaturates in the feedstock−total polyunsaturates in the product)/total polyunsaturates in the feed. As used here, the term “selectivity” may refer to the distribution of monounsaturates formed in the hydrogenation step in comparison to paraffins and/or saturated esters. In other words, selectivity=total monounsaturates in product/(total monounsaturates in product+total saturates in the product). As mentioned above, the terminal olefin and internal olefin may be derived from a natural oil feedstock, in addition to other valuable compositions. A number of valuable compositions may be targeted through the self-metathesis reaction of a natural oil feedstock, or the cross-metathesis reaction of the natural oil feedstock with a low-molecular-weight olefin or mid-weight olefin, in the presence of a metathesis catalyst. Such valuable compositions may include fuel compositions, detergents, surfactants, and other specialty chemicals. Non-limiting examples of fuel compositions include jet, kerosene, and diesel fuel. Additionally, transesterified products (i.e., the products formed from transesterifying an ester in the presence of an alcohol) may also be targeted, non-limiting examples of which include: fatty acid methyl esters; biodiesel; 9-decenoic acid (“9DA”) esters, 9-undecenoic acid (“9UDA”) esters, and/or 9-dodecenoic acid (“9DDA”) esters; 9DA, 9UDA, and/or 9DDA; alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts of 9DA, 9UDA, and/or 9DDA; dimers of the transesterified products; and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, prior to a metathesis reaction, a natural oil feedstock may be treated to render the natural oil more suitable for the subsequent metathesis reaction. In certain embodiments, the natural oil preferably is a vegetable oil or vegetable oil derivative, such as soybean oil.

While neither desiring to be bound by any particular theory nor intending to limit in any measure the scope of the appended claims or their equivalents, it is presently believed that the following non-exhaustive and non-limiting list of representative treatment methodologies can be useful in treating feedstocks that contain the specified contaminants (provided the agents are compatible with any functional groups on the feedstock and/or with the contaminants themselves, etc.): (a) a thermal treatment—for example, heating (and/or distilling) a feedstock (e.g., between about 100° C. and about 250° C., or around 200° C. in some embodiments—depending on the feedstock's boiling point, optionally with a purge of an inert gas such as N2 and/or the like) and/or treatment with an adsorbent (e.g., alumina and the like) can be useful in decomposing peroxide contaminants and/or decomposition products thereof; (b) treatment with an acid anhydride (e.g., acetic anhydride, Ac2O) can be useful in removing moisture, active hydroxyl-containing materials (e.g., alcohols), and hydroperoxides (via acetylation); (c) treatment with a desiccant (e.g., silica gel, alumina, molecular sieves, magnesium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and the like, and combinations thereof) and/or an organometallic reagent (e.g., t-butyl lithium, triethyl aluminum, tributyl aluminum, triisopropyl aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, and the like, and combinations thereof) and/or metal hydrides (e.g., CaH2 and the like) and/or acid anhydrides (e.g., acetic anhydride and the like) can be useful in removing moisture; (d) treatment with an adsorbent (e.g., alumina, silica gel, and the like, and combinations thereof) and/or an organometallic reagent (e.g., t-butyl lithium, triethyl aluminum, tributyl aluminum, triisopropyl aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, and the like, and combinations thereof) and/or a metal amide (e.g., LDA, KHMDA, and the like) can be useful in removing protic materials; (e) treatment with an adsorbent (e.g., alumina, silica gel, activated charcoal, and the like, and combinations thereof) can be useful in removing polar materials; (f) treatment with an organometallic reagent (e.g., (e.g., t-butyl lithium, triethyl aluminum, tributyl aluminum, triisopropyl aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, and the like, and combinations thereof) can be useful in removing Lewis basic catalyst poisons; etc. In some embodiments, the first agent used to treat a feedstock prior to a metathesis reaction comprises an adsorbent which, in some embodiments, is selected from the group consisting of silica gel, alumina, bleaching clay, activated carbon, molecular sieves, zeolites, fuller's earth, diatomaceous earth, and the like, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the first agent is selected from the group consisting of optionally heat-treated molecular sieves, optionally heat-treated alumina, and a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the adsorbent comprises optionally heat-treated activated alumina which, in some embodiments, is selected from the group consisting of optionally heat-treated activated acidic alumina, optionally heat-treated activated neutral alumina, optionally heat-treated activated basic alumina, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the absorbent comprises optionally heat-treated activated neutral alumina, which can be useful in treating feedstocks (e.g., olefins) that are susceptible to acid-catalyzed isomerization and/or rearrangement. For embodiments in which the first agent, second agent, third agent, and/or any additional agents used in accordance with the present teachings comprises an adsorbent (e.g., molecular sieves, alumina, etc.), it is presently believed that the treating of the feedstock with the adsorbent is more effectively performed by flowing the feedstock through the first agent using a percolation- or flow-type system (e.g., chromatography column) as opposed to simply adding the adsorbent to the feedstock at the bottom of a container. In some embodiments, about 20 wt % of alumina is used in a column. While neither desiring to be bound by any particular theory nor intending to limit in any measure the scope of the appended claims or their equivalents, it is presently believed that treating a feedstock with alumina on about a 5-to-1 weight-to-weight basis is effective for some embodiments. However, it is to be understood that the amount of alumina used is not restricted and will be both feedstock- and impurity dependent in addition to being impacted by the form of the alumina, its activation process, and the precise treatment method (e.g., flow through a column vs. direct addition to container). In some embodiments, the first agent, second agent, third agent, and/or any additional agents used to treat a feedstock prior to a metathesis reaction comprises a trialkyl aluminum which, in some embodiments, is selected from the group consisting of triethyl aluminum, tributyl aluminum, triisopropyl aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, triisobutyl aluminum and the like, and combinations thereof. While neither desiring to be bound by any particular theory nor intending to limit in any measure the scope of the appended claims or their equivalents, it is presently believed that in some cases the treatment of a feedstock with a trialkyl aluminum greatly improves feedstock conversions at low concentrations of metathesis catalyst but that in the presence of excess trialkyl aluminum, catalyst performance is adversely affected. Thus, in some embodiments (e.g., when a trialkyl aluminum is used as a first agent and/or an excess of trialkyl aluminum is used), a successive agent used to treat the feedstock can comprise an adsorbent which can remove excess trialkyl aluminum. In other embodiments, the amount of trialkyl aluminum used for treatment of the feedstock can be reduced by first treating the feedstock with a different agent of a type described herein (e.g., an adsorbent including but not limited to molecular sieves, alumina, and/or the like), and then introducing the trialkyl aluminum as a second (or subsequent) agent to remove residual contaminants. In any event, while neither desiring to be bound by any particular theory nor intending to limit in any measure the scope of the appended claims or their equivalents, it is presently believed that removal of excess trialkyl aluminum from organic products should be performed with great caution since use of the wrong adsorbent might lead to a highly exothermic reaction or a highly unstable species. In some embodiments, the trialkylaluminum is attached to a solid support to simplify its removal. In some embodiments, molecular sieves can be used as a first agent for bulk drying a feedstock, “high heat-treated” alumina can then be used as a second agent to remove additional moisture, and finally molecular sieves can be used at the end as a third agent for removing still further residual moisture. In other embodiments, molecular sieves can be used as a first agent for bulk drying a feedstock, “high heat-treated” alumina can then be used as a second agent to remove additional moisture, and finally a trialkyl aluminum (e.g., triethyl aluminum, tributyl aluminum, triisopropyl aluminum, trioctyl aluminum, triisobutyl aluminum and the like, and combinations thereof) can be used as a third agent for removing any further residual moisture. In one particular embodiment, activated copper powder is used alone or in combination with another treatment. For example, in some embodiments, activated copper powder is used in combination with heat (e.g., 200° C. for at least 2 hours under nitrogen gas), molecular sieves, and/or a trialkylaluminum treatment. In another embodiment, activated magnesium tunings are used alone or in combination with another treatment. For example, in some embodiments, activated magnesium tunings are used in combination with heat (e.g., 200° C. for at least 2 hours under nitrogen gas), molecular sieves, and/or a trialkylaluminum treatment. In another particular embodiment, acetic anhydride is used alone or in combination with another treatment/agent. For example, in some embodiments, acetic anhydride is used in combination with alumina (aluminum oxide) and/or a trialkylaluminum treatment. In other embodiments, acetic anhydride is used in combination with alumina, distillation, molecular sieves, and/or a trialkylaluminum treatment. Further, percolation on activated alumina or molecular sieves can be applied before or instead of the triaklyaluminum treatment. In another embodiment, alumina is used alone or in combination with another treatment/agent. In one embodiment, alumina is used in combination with a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst and/or a trialkylaluminum treatment. Additionally, in certain embodiments, the low-molecular-weight olefin or mid-weight olefin may also be treated prior to the metathesis reaction with the natural oil. Like the natural oil treatment, the low-molecular-weight olefin or mid-weight olefin may be treated to remove poisons that may impact or diminish catalyst activity using any of the above-mentioned methods of treatment. In certain embodiments, the low-molecular-weight olefin or mid-weight olefin may be self-metathesized to form a metathesized low-molecular-weight olefin or metathesized mid-weight olefin in order to adjust the properties of the olefin and the potential products following metathesis with the natural oil. In some embodiments, the low-molecular-weight olefin or mid-weight olefin is self-metathesized in the presence of a rhenium oxide catalyst (e.g., rhenium oxide supported on alumina) or tungsten oxide catalyst (e.g., tungsten oxide supported on silica). This reaction may be conducted in a fixed bed reactor. In one embodiment, the low-molecular-weight olefin is 1-butene. The low-molecular-weight olefin may be self-metathesized over rhenium oxide catalyst in a fixed bed reactor to produce mainly 3-hexene and ethylene. Ethylene may be separated from the reactor effluent for further processing, such as being sent to an ethylene purification system or ethylene oxide system. Unreacted low-molecular-weight olefin (e.g., 1-butene) may be recycled to the fixed bed reactor and the metathesized low-weight-olefin (e.g., 3-hexene) may be sent to the metathesis reactor for metathesis with the natural oil. In other embodiments, the low-molecular-weight olefin or mid-weight olefin is isomerized prior to being metathesized with the natural oil. Adjusting the composition and properties of the low-molecular-weight olefin or mid-weight olefin through isomerization may allow for different products or different ratios of products to be formed following metathesis of the low-molecular-weight olefin or mid-weight olefin with a natural oil. In some embodiments, the isomerized or branched low-molecular-weight olefin is in the C4 to C10 range. In one embodiment, hexene is isomerized to form a branched low-molecular-weight olefin. Non-limiting examples of branched low-molecular-weight olefins include isobutene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-3-pentene, and 2,2-dimethyl-3-pentene. By using branched low-molecular-weight olefins or branched mid-weight olefins in the metathesis reaction, the metathesized product will include branched olefins, which can be subsequently hydrogenated to iso-paraffins. In certain embodiments, the branched low-molecular-weight olefins or branched mid-weight olefins may help achieve the desired performance properties for a fuel composition, such as jet, kerosene, or diesel fuel. In certain embodiments, C11-C14 olefins may be targeted following metathesis and separation steps through isomerization of the low-molecular-weight olefin. In other embodiments, the branched low-molecular-weight olefins or branched mid-weight olefins may help target longer chain esters for use as detergents or cleaning compositions. In some embodiments, C10-C15 or C11-C14 methyl esters may be targeted following metathesis, separation, and transesterification steps (discussed in detail below). Isomerization reactions are well-known in the art, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,150,205; 4,210,771; 5,095,169; and 6,214,764, herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. As shown in FIG. 1, after this optional treatment of the natural oil feedstock, low-molecular-weight olefin, and/or mid-weight olefin, the natural oil 12 is reacted with itself, or combined with a low-molecular-weight olefin 14 or mid-weight olefin 15 in a metathesis reactor 20 in the presence of a metathesis catalyst. Metathesis catalysts and metathesis reaction conditions are discussed in greater detail below. In certain embodiments, in the presence of a metathesis catalyst, the natural oil 12 undergoes a self-metathesis reaction with itself. In other embodiments, in the presence of the metathesis catalyst, the natural oil 12 undergoes a cross-metathesis reaction with the low-molecular-weight olefin 14 or mid-weight olefin 15. In certain embodiments, the natural oil 12 undergoes both self- and cross-metathesis reactions in parallel metathesis reactors. The self-metathesis and/or cross-metathesis reaction form a metathesized product 22 wherein the metathesized product 22 comprises olefins 32 and esters 34. In certain embodiments, the low-molecular-weight olefin 14 is in the C2 to C6 range. As a non-limiting example, in one embodiment, the low-molecular-weight olefin 14 may comprise at least one of the following: ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 2-butene, isobutene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, 3-pentene, 2-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, cyclopentene, 1,4-pentadiene, 1-hexene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, 4-hexene, 2-methyl-1-pentene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 2-methyl-2-pentene, 3-methyl-2-pentene, 4-methyl-2-pentene, 2-methyl-3-pentene, and cyclohexene. Non-limiting examples of low-molecular-weight olefins in the C7 to C9 range include 1,4-heptadiene, 1-heptene, 3,6-nonadiene, 3-nonene, 1,4,7-octatriene. In another embodiment, the low-molecular-weight olefin 14 comprises at least one of styrene and vinyl cyclohexane. In another embodiment, the low-molecular-weight olefin 14 may comprise at least one of ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 2-butene, and isobutene. In another embodiment, the low-molecular-weight olefin 14 comprises at least one alpha-olefin or terminal olefin in the C2 to C10 range. In another embodiment, the low-molecular-weight olefin 14 comprises at least one branched low-molecular-weight olefin in the C4 to C10 range. Non-limiting examples of branched low-molecular-weight olefins include isobutene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-3-pentene, and 2,2-dimethyl-3-pentene. In certain embodiments, the mid-weight olefin 15 comprises unsaturated straight, branched, or cyclic hydrocarbons in the C15 to C24 range. In some embodiments, the mid-weight olefin is an alpha-olefin or terminal olefin. As noted, it is possible to use a mixture of various linear or branched low-molecular-weight olefins and linear or branched mid-weight olefins in the reaction to achieve the desired metathesis product distribution. In certain embodiments, the mixture comprises linear and/or branched low-molecular-weight olefins. In other embodiments, the mixture comprises linear and/or branched mid-weight olefins. In one embodiment, a mixture of butenes (1-butene, 2-butenes, and, optionally, isobutene) may be employed as the low-molecular-weight olefin, offering a low cost, commercially available feedstock instead a purified source of one particular butene. Such low cost mixed butene feedstocks are typically diluted with n-butane and/or isobutane. In certain embodiments, recycled streams from downstream separation units may be introduced to the metathesis reactor 20 in addition to the natural oil 12 and, in some embodiments, the low-molecular-weight olefin 14 and/or mid-weight olefin 15. For instance, in some embodiments, a C2-C6 recycle olefin stream or a C3-C4 bottoms stream from an overhead separation unit may be returned to the metathesis reactor. In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1, a light weight olefin stream 44 from an olefin separation unit 40 may be returned to the metathesis reactor 20. In another embodiment, the C3-C4 bottoms stream and the light weight olefin stream 44 are combined together and returned to the metathesis reactor 20. In another embodiment, a C15+ bottoms stream 46 from the olefin separation unit 40 is returned to the metathesis reactor 20. In another embodiment, all of the aforementioned recycle streams are returned to the metathesis reactor 20. In another embodiment, one or more of the recycle streams may be selectively hydrogenated to increase the concentration of mono-olefins in the stream. In other embodiments, various ester streams downstream of the transesterification unit (discussed below) may also be recycled or returned to the metathesis reactor 20. In certain embodiments, a glycerolysis reaction may be conducted on the recycled ester stream to prevent or limit the amount of free glycerol entering the metathesis reactor 20. In some embodiments, the recycled ester stream will undergo a purification step to limit the amount of methanol being recycled to the metathesis reactor 20. In some embodiments, the recycled ester stream is combined with the low-molecular-weight olefin 14 and/or mid-weight olefin 15 prior to conducting the glycerolysis reaction and entering the metathesis reactor 20. In another embodiment, the recycled ester stream may be partially or selectively hydrogenated to increase the concentration of monounsaturated esters in the stream. The glycerolysis reaction may also limit or prevent free fatty acid methyl esters from entering the metathesis reaction and subsequently exiting the metathesis reactor as free fatty acid methyl esters that may boil close to various high-valued olefin products. In such cases, these methyl ester components may be separated with the olefins during the separation of the olefins and esters. Such methyl ester components may be difficult to separate from the olefins by distillation. The metathesis reaction in the metathesis reactor 20 produces a metathesized product 22. In one embodiment, the metathesized product 22 enters a flash vessel operated under temperature and pressure conditions which cause C2 or C2-C3 compounds to flash off and be removed overhead. The C2 or C2-C3 light ends are comprised of a majority of hydrocarbon compounds having a carbon number of 2 or 3. In certain embodiments, the C2 or C2-C3 light ends are then sent to an overhead separation unit, wherein the C2 or C2-C3 compounds are further separated overhead from the heavier compounds that flashed off with the C2-C3 compounds. These heavier compounds are typically C3-C5 compounds carried overhead with the C2 or C2-C3 compounds. After separation in the overhead separation unit, the overhead C2 or C2-C3 stream may then be used as a fuel source. These hydrocarbons have their own value outside the scope of a fuel composition, and may be used or separated at this stage for other valued compositions and applications. In certain embodiments, the bottoms stream from the overhead separation unit containing mostly C3-C5 compounds is returned as a recycle stream to the metathesis reactor. In the flash vessel, the metathesized product 22 that does not flash overhead is sent downstream for separation in a separation unit 30, such as a distillation column. Prior to the separation unit 30, in certain embodiments, the metathesized product 22 may be contacted with a reactant or reagent to deactivate or to extract the catalyst. In certain embodiments, the metathesized product 22 is introduced to an adsorbent or complexing agent to facilitate the separation of the metathesized product 22 from the metathesis catalyst. In one embodiment, the adsorbent or complexing agent is a clay bed. The clay bed will adsorb the metathesis catalyst, and after a filtration step, the metathesized product 22 can be sent to the separation unit 30 for further processing. In another embodiment, the adsorbent or complexing agent is a water soluble phosphine reagent such as tris hydroxymethyl phosphine (THMP). Catalyst may be separated with a water soluble phosphine through known liquid-liquid extraction mechanisms by decanting the aqueous phase from the organic phase. In some embodiments, the metathesized product 22 may be sent to a catalyst kill drum where the reagent (e.g., THMP aqueous solution) is added to deactivate the metathesis catalyst. THMP may be added at a rate equivalent to at least 1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 25:1, or 50:1 molar ratio relative to the catalyst pumped into the catalyst kill drum. In certain embodiments, the reagent (e.g., THMP) can be left in the metathesized product 22 and carried along, either in whole or in part, into a subsequent chemical reaction or processing step. In other embodiments, the reagent can be separated and removed from the mixture, either partially or completely, prior to any subsequent reaction or processing step. In some embodiments, passivation and extraction can be coupled into one step (e.g., by providing the reagent in the extracting material). In one embodiment, the catalyst separation occurs by sending the effluent from the catalyst kill drum to a catalyst decanter drum. The decanter drum may function as a horizontal vessel with a vertical baffle and a boot to collect the water phase containing the metathesis catalyst. In some embodiments, the decanter drum operates at a temperature between approximately 60-90° C. and a pressure between 1-1.5 atm, or approximately 53° C. (127° F.) and 1.1 atm (16 psia). In other embodiments, the catalyst separation comprises washing or extracting the mixture with a polar solvent (e.g., particularly, though not exclusively, for embodiments in which the reagent is at least partially soluble in the polar solvent). In some embodiments, the polar solvent is added in a subsequent step following catalyst deactivation. In other embodiments, the polar solvent (e.g., water) is added to the metathesized product 22 at approximately the same time as the deactivation reagent (e.g., THMP). Near simultaneous addition of the deactivation reagent and polar solvent to the metathesized product can eliminate the need for an additional reaction/separation vessel, which may simply the process and potentially save capital. In some embodiments, the polar solvent is at least partially non-miscible with the mixture, such that a separation of layers can occur. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the reagent is partitioned into the polar solvent layer, which can then be separated from the non-miscible remaining layer and removed. Representative polar solvents for use in accordance with the present teachings include but are not limited to water, alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, etc.), ethylene glycol, glycerol, DMF, multifunctional polar compounds including but not limited to polyethylene glycols and/or glymes, ionic liquids, and the like, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the mixture is extracted with water. In some embodiments, when a phosphite ester that is at least partially hydrolyzable (e.g., in some embodiments, a phosphite ester having a low molecular weight, including but not limited to trimethyl phosphite, triethyl phosphite, and a combination thereof) is used as a reagent, washing the mixture with water may convert the phosphite ester into a corresponding acid. While neither desiring to be bound by any particular theory nor intending to limit in any measure the scope of the appended claims or their equivalents, it is presently believed that such a hydrolysis may occur more rapidly with lower molecular weight esters. In some embodiments, when extraction with a polar solvent is desired, the extraction may comprise high shear mixing (e.g., mixing of a type sufficient to disperse and/or transport at least a portion of a first phase and/or chemical species into a second phase with which the first phase and/or a chemical species would normally be at least partly immiscible) although such mixing, in some embodiments, may contribute to undesirable emulsion formation. In some embodiments, the extracting comprises low-intensity mixing (e.g., stirring that is not high shear). The present teachings are in no way restricted to any particular type or duration of mixing. However, for purposes of illustration, in some embodiments, the extracting comprises mixing the polar solvent and the mixture together for at least about 1 second, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 25 minutes, 30 minutes, 35 minutes, 40 minutes, 45 minutes, 50 minutes, 55 minutes, or 60 minutes. While neither desiring to be bound by any particular theory nor intending to limit in any measure the scope of the appended claims or their equivalents, it is presently believed that shorter mixing times (e.g., on the order of a second or seconds) are achievable when inline shear mixing is used for mixing. When extraction with a polar solvent is desired, the present teachings are in no way restricted to any particular amount of polar solvent added to the mixture for the extracting. However, for purposes of illustration, in some embodiments, the amount by weight of polar solvent (e.g., water) added to the mixture for the extracting is more than the weight of the mixture. In some embodiments, the amount by weight of polar solvent (e.g., water) added to the mixture for the extracting is less than the weight of the mixture. In some embodiments, the weight ratio of the mixture to the water added to the mixture is at least about 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:1, 20:1, 40:1, or 100:1. For higher oil to water ratios, extraction and separation using a centrifuge and/or coalescer may be desirable. In some embodiments, when extraction with a polar solvent is desired, methods for suppressing dehydrogenation in accordance with the present teachings further comprise allowing a settling period following the polar solvent wash to promote phase separation. The present teachings are in no way restricted to any particular duration of settling period. However, for purposes of illustration, in some embodiments, the settling period is at least about 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 60 minutes, or 120 minutes. In addition to or as an alternative to washing the mixture with a polar solvent to remove the reagent (e.g., THMP)—a method in accordance with the present teachings can optionally further comprise removing at least a portion of the reagent by adsorbing it onto an adsorbent, which optionally can then be physically separated from the mixture (e.g., via filtration, centrifugation, crystallization, or the like). In some embodiments, the adsorbent is polar. Representative adsorbents for use in accordance with the present teachings include but are not limited to carbon, silica, silica-alumina, alumina, clay, magnesium silicates (e.g., Magnesols), the synthetic silica adsorbent sold under the trade name TRISYL by W. R. Grace & Co., diatomaceous earth, polystyrene, macroporous (MP) resins, and the like, and combinations thereof. Additionally, in certain embodiments, prior to the separation unit 30 (and after catalyst separation, in some instances), the metathesis product 22 may be sent to a hydrogenation unit, wherein the carbon-carbon double bonds in the olefins and esters are partially, selectively, or fully saturated with hydrogen gas. Hydrogenation may be conducted according to any known method in the art for hydrogenating double bond-containing compounds such as the olefins and esters present in the metathesis product 22. In certain embodiments, the metathesis product is partially or selectively hydrogenated to increase the concentration of monounsaturated olefins and/or ester compounds present in the metathesis product 22. In certain embodiments, in the diene selective hydrogenation, the conversion rate from the polyunsaturated olefins and esters to paraffins, saturated esters, monounsaturated olefins, and monounsaturated esters may be at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 85%, at least 95%, or at least 98%. The selectivity towards the monounsaturated olefins and monounsaturated esters instead of the paraffins and saturated esters is at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99%, or at least 99.5%. In certain embodiments, in the hydrogenation unit, hydrogen gas is reacted with the metathesis product 22 in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst to produce a hydrogenated product comprising partially to fully hydrogenated paraffins/olefins and partially to fully hydrogenated esters. In some embodiments, the metathesis product 22 is hydrogenated in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst comprising nickel, copper, palladium, platinum, molybdenum, iron, ruthenium, osmium, rhodium, or iridium, individually or in combinations thereof. Useful catalyst may be heterogeneous or homogeneous. In some embodiments, the catalysts are supported nickel or sponge nickel type catalysts. In some embodiments, the hydrogenation catalyst comprises nickel that has been chemically reduced with hydrogen to an active state (i.e., reduced nickel) provided on a support. The support may comprise porous silica (e.g., kieselguhr, infusorial, diatomaceous, or siliceous earth) or alumina. The catalysts are characterized by a high nickel surface area per gram of nickel. Commercial examples of supported nickel hydrogenation catalysts include those available under the trade designations “NYSOFACT”, “NYSOSEL”, and “NI 5248 D” (from BASF Catalysts LLC, Iselin, N.J.). Additional supported nickel hydrogenation catalysts include those commercially available under the trade designations “PRICAT 9908”, “PRICAT 9910”, “PRICAT 9920”, “PRICAT 9932,” “PRICAT 9936,” “PRICAT 9939,” “PRICAT 9953,” “PRICAT 20/15 D,” “PRICAT NI 52/35 P,” “PRICAT NI 55/5 P,” “PRICAT NI 60/15 P,” “PRICAT NI 62/15 P,” “PRICAT NI 52/35 T,” “PRICAT NI 55/5 T,” and “PRICAT NI 60/15 T” (available from Johnson Matthey Catalysts, Ward Hill, Mass.) (wherein D=droplet, P=powder, and T=tablet). The supported nickel catalysts may be of the type described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,351,566, U.S. Pat. No. 6,846,772, EP 0168091, and EP 0167201, incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. In other embodiments, the hydrogenation catalyst comprises copper that has been chemically reduced with hydrogen to an active state (i.e., reduced copper) provided on a support. The support may comprise porous silica (e.g., kieselguhr, infusorial, diatomaceous, or siliceous earth) or alumina. Commercial examples of supported copper hydrogenation catalysts include “PRICAT CU 60/8 T,” “PRICAT CU 60/35 T,” “PRICAT CU 50/8 P,” and “PRICAT CU 60/35 P” (available from Johnson Matthey Catalysts, Ward Hill, Mass.) (wherein T=tablet and P=powder). Hydrogenation may be carried out in a batch or in a continuous process and may be a partial, selective, or complete hydrogenation. In certain embodiments, the hydrogenation is a selective hydrogenation, wherein the polyunsaturated olefins or esters in the metathesis product 22 are selectively saturated to form compositions having higher amounts of monounsaturated olefins or esters, while limiting the amount of fully saturated hydrocarbons or saturated esters produced. In some embodiments, the partial or selective hydrogenation reaction may be conducted over a period of time ranging from 10-360 minutes, 20-240 minutes, 30-180 minutes, or 60-90 minutes. In certain embodiments, the temperature at which the partial or selective hydrogenation step ranges from about 50° C. to about 350° C., about 100° C. to about 300° C., about 150° C. to about 250° C., about 100° C. to about 150° C., about 150° C., or about 180° C. The desired temperature may vary, for example, with hydrogen gas pressure. Typically, a higher gas pressure will require a lower temperature. Hydrogen gas is pumped into the reaction vessel to achieve a desired pressure of H2 gas. In certain embodiments, the H2 gas pressure ranges from about 15 psig (1 atm) to about 3000 psig (204.1 atm), about 15 psig (1 atm) to about 90 psig (6.1 atm), or about 50 psig (3.4 atm) to about 500 psig (34 atm). As the gas pressure increases, more specialized high-pressure processing equipment may be required. In certain embodiments, the reaction conditions are “mild,” wherein the temperature is approximately between approximately 50° C. and approximately 100° C. and the H2 gas pressure is less than approximately 100 psig. In other embodiments, the temperature is between about 100° C. and about 150° C., and the pressure is between about 50 psig (3.4 atm) and about 500 psig (34 atm). In some embodiments, the temperature is about 150° C. and the hydrogen gas pressure is about 100 psig (6.8 atm). In other embodiments, the temperature is about 180° C. and the hydrogen gas pressure is about 100 psig (6.8 atm). When the desired degree of hydrogenation is reached, the reaction mass is cooled to the desired filtration temperature. The amount of hydrogenation catalyst is typically selected in view of a number of factors including, for example, the type of hydrogenation catalyst used, the amount of feed used, the degree of unsaturation in the material to be hydrogenated, the desired rate of hydrogenation, the desired degree of hydrogenation (e.g., as measured by iodine value (IV)), the selectivity of the hydrogenation, the purity of the reagent, and the H2 gas pressure. In some embodiments, the hydrogenation catalyst is used in an amount of about 10 weight % or less, for example, about 5 weight % or less or about 1 weight % or less of the substrate being treated. In some embodiments, the amount of hydrogenation catalyst is between 0.01-1.0 wt %, between 0.02-0.5 wt %, or between 0.1-0.25 wt % of the substrate being treated (e.g., the metathesis product 22 or olefins 32, as described below). In certain embodiments, the hydrogenation catalyst may be reused or recycled for a subsequent use or for multiple uses. In some embodiments, the hydrogenation catalyst is recycled once. In other embodiments, it is recycled two times, or three or more times. When the desired degree of hydrogenation is reached, the reaction mass is cooled to the desired filtration temperature. During hydrogenation, the carbon-carbon double bonds are partially to fully saturated by the hydrogen gas. In one embodiment, the olefins in the metathesis product 22 are reacted with hydrogen to form a fuel composition comprising only or mostly paraffins. Additionally, the esters from the metathesis product are fully or nearly fully saturated in the hydrogenation unit. In other embodiment, the resulting hydrogenated product includes only partially saturated olefins and partially saturated esters. In some embodiments, the resulting selective hydrogenation product is comprised of an increased percentage of monounsaturated olefins and/or esters. In the separation unit 30, in certain embodiments, the metathesized product 22 (from a hydrogenation unit, metathesis reactor 20, or catalyst separation unit) is separated into at least two product streams. In one embodiment, the metathesized product 22 is sent to the separation unit 30, or distillation column, to separate the olefins 32 from the esters 34. In another embodiment, a byproduct stream comprising C7's and cyclohexadienes (e.g., 1,4-cyclohexadiene) may be removed in a side-stream from the separation unit 30. In certain embodiments, the separated olefins 32 may comprise hydrocarbons with carbon numbers up to 24. In certain embodiments, the esters 34 may comprise metathesized glycerides. In other words, the lighter end olefins 32 are preferably separated or distilled overhead for processing into olefin compositions, while the esters 34, comprised mostly of compounds having carboxylic acid/ester functionality, are drawn into a bottoms stream. Based on the quality of the separation, it is possible for some ester compounds to be carried into the overhead olefin stream 32, and it is also possible for some heavier olefin hydrocarbons to be carried into the ester stream 34. Additionally, the separated cyclohexadienes (e.g., 1,4-cyclohexadiene) may be further processed in a dehydrogenation step to form benzene. Examples of catalytic dehydrogenation catalysts include platinum supported on alumina. Examples of oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts include mixed metal oxides consisting of molybdenum, vanadium, niobium, tellurium, magnesium, and/or aluminum. Other dehydrogenation catalysts examples include cerium/zirconium, alkaline earth/nickel, calcium-nickel-phosphate, chromium, iron-chromium oxide, bismuth/molybdenum, tin/antimony, silver, or copper. In one embodiment, the olefins 32 may be collected and sold for any number of known uses. In other embodiments, the olefins 32 are further processed in an olefin separation unit 40 and/or hydrogenation unit 50 (where the olefinic bonds are saturated with hydrogen gas 48, as described below). In other embodiments, the olefins 32 are selectively hydrogenated to increase the mono-olefin concentration. In other embodiments, esters 34 comprising heavier end glycerides and free fatty acids are separated or distilled as a bottoms product for further processing into various products. In certain embodiments, further processing may target the production of the following non-limiting examples: fatty acid methyl esters; biodiesel; 9DA esters, 9UDA esters, and/or 9DDA esters; 9DA, 9UDA, and/or 9DDA; alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts of 9DA, 9UDA, and/or 9DDA; diacids, and/or diesters of the transesterified products; and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, further processing may target the production of C15-C18 fatty acids and/or esters. In other embodiments, further processing may target the production of diacids and/or diesters. In yet other embodiments, further processing may target the production of compounds having molecular weights greater than the molecular weights of stearic acid and/or linolenic acid. As shown in FIG. 1, regarding the overhead olefins 32 from the separation unit 30, the olefins 32 may be further separated or distilled in the olefin separation unit 40 to separate the various compositions. The olefin separation unit 40 may comprise a number of distillation towers. In some embodiments, the various composition streams are separated using at least four distillation towers. In other embodiments, three towers or less are used to separate the olefin compositions. In one embodiment, light end olefins 44 consisting of mainly C2-C9 compounds may be distilled into an overhead stream from the olefin separation unit 40. In certain embodiments, the light end olefins 44 are comprised of a majority of C3-C8 hydrocarbon compounds. In other embodiments, heavier olefins having higher carbon numbers may be separated overhead into the light end olefin stream 44 to assist in targeting a specific fuel composition. The light end olefins 44 may be recycled to the metathesis reactor 20, purged from the system for further processing and sold, or a combination of the two. In one embodiment, the light end olefins 44 may be partially purged from the system and partially recycled to the metathesis reactor 20. With regards to the other streams in the olefin separation unit 40, a heavier C16+, C18+, C20+, C22+, or C24+ compound stream may be separated out as an olefin bottoms stream 46. This olefin bottoms stream 46 may be purged or recycled to the metathesis reactor 20 for further processing, or a combination of the two. In another embodiment, a center-cut olefin stream 42 may be separated out of the olefin distillation unit for further processing. The center-cut olefins 42 may be designed to target a selected carbon number range for a specific fuel composition. As a non-limiting example, a C5-C15 distribution may be targeted for further processing into a naphtha-type jet fuel. Alternatively, a C8-C16 distribution may be targeted for further processing into a kerosene-type jet fuel. In another embodiment, a C8-C25 distribution may be targeted for further processing into a diesel fuel. In some embodiments, processing steps may be conducted to maximize alpha olefin purity. In other embodiments, processing steps may be conducted to maximize C10 olefin purity. For example, C10+ olefins from the separation unit 30 or a particular olefin stream may be reacted with ethylene in the presence of a metathesis catalyst in a secondary metathesis reactor to improve the C10 olefin purity. In one embodiment, the metathesis catalyst is a rhenium oxide catalyst (e.g., rhenium oxide supported on alumina). In another embodiment, the metathesis is a tungsten oxide catalyst (e.g., tungsten oxide supported on silica). This metathesis reaction may be conducted in a fixed bed reactor. In some embodiments, the ethylene reagent can be recycled back to the secondary metathesis reactor. Lighter olefins (C4-C9) from the secondary metathesis reactor may be mixed with the main metathesis reactor olefins from the separation unit 30 for further processing. In certain embodiments, the olefins 32 may be oligomerized to form poly-alpha-olefins (PAOs) or poly-internal-olefins (PIOs), mineral oil substitutes, and/or biodiesel fuel. The oligomerization reaction may take place after the distillation unit 30 or after the overhead olefin separation unit 40. In certain embodiments, byproducts from the oligomerization reactions may be recycled back to the metathesis reactor 20 for further processing. In other embodiments, the olefins 32, light end olefins 44, or center-cut olefins 42 may be self-metathesized in the presence of a metathesis catalyst in a secondary metathesis reactor in order to produce heavier weight C14+, C16+, or C18+ olefin products. In one embodiment, the metathesis catalyst is a rhenium oxide catalyst (e.g., rhenium oxide supported on alumina). In another embodiment, the metathesis is a tungsten oxide catalyst (e.g., tungsten oxide supported on silica). This metathesis reaction may be conducted in a fixed bed reactor. The heavier weight C14+, C16+, or C18+ olefins may be used as surfactants or oil lubes. In some embodiments, the lighter olefin byproducts from the self-metathesis reaction may be recycled back to the secondary metathesis reactor or primary metathesis reactor 20 for further processing. In certain embodiments, the olefins 32, center-cut olefins 42, light end olefins 44, or olefin bottoms 46 may be pre-treated to remove potential catalyst poisons prior to the hydrogenation unit 50. Examples of potential feedstock pretreatments (such as adsorbants, alumina, or heat) for the olefin stream(s) are described above with regard to potential treatment of the natural oil 12. As mentioned, in one embodiment, the olefins 32 from the separation unit 30 may be sent directly to the hydrogenation unit 50. In another embodiment, the center-cut olefins 42, light end olefins 44, or olefin bottoms 46 from the olefin separation unit 40 may be sent to the hydrogenation unit 50. Hydrogenation may be conducted according to any known method in the art for hydrogenating double bond-containing compounds such as the olefins 32, center-cut olefins 42, light end olefins 44, or olefin bottoms 46. In certain embodiments, in the hydrogenation unit 50, hydrogen gas 48 is reacted with the olefins 32, center-cut olefins 42, light end olefins 44, or olefin bottoms 46 in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst to produce a hydrogenated product 52. Typical hydrogenation catalysts and reaction conditions are discussed above. During hydrogenation, the carbon-carbon double bond containing compounds in the olefins are hydrogenated to partially, selectively, or fully saturated compounds by the hydrogen gas 48. In one embodiment, the resulting hydrogenated product 52 includes hydrocarbons with a distribution centered between approximately C10 and C12 hydrocarbons for naphtha- and kerosene-type jet fuel compositions. In another embodiment, the distribution is centered between approximately C16 and C18 for a diesel fuel composition. In other embodiments, the olefins are selectively hydrogenated to decrease the presence of polyunsaturated olefins and increase the presence of monounsaturated olefins. The olefins 32 from the separation unit 30 may comprise polyolefins (e.g., dienes or trienes), with the amount of polyunsaturation depending on the inherent characteristics of the natural oil 12. Polyunsaturated olefins, such as dienes and trienes, may pose a number of problems for downstream processing and end-use over monounsaturated olefin compounds. Dienes and trienes may have oxidation rates that are 10-100 times those of monounsaturated olefins. These oxidation products would make some materials unsuitable for some applications such as advanced oilfield recovery. It therefore may prove beneficial to reduce the amount of polyunsaturation present in the olefins 32 from the separation unit 30. At the same time, olefins may be more valuable that paraffin compositions. Therefore, in some embodiments, the olefins 32, light end olefins 44, center-cut olefins 42, or olefin bottoms 46 are partially or selectively hydrogenated to remove the polyunsaturation and form monounsaturated olefins. The typical reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, time of reaction, and hydrogenation catalyst type, are described above with regard to partial or selective hydrogenation of the metathesis product 22. Partially or Selectively hydrogenated olefin products 52 may be useful for the preparation of surfactants/surfactant precursors including but not limited to linear alkyl benzene. In certain embodiments, the partially or the selectively hydrogenated product 52 may be useful for but not limited to advanced oilfield recovery or drilling fluids. In certain embodiments, in the diene selective hydrogenation, the conversion rate from polyunsaturated olefins to paraffins and monounsaturated olefins may be at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 85%, at least 95%, or at least 98%. The selectivity towards monounsaturated olefins instead of paraffin is at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99%, or at least 99.5%. In certain embodiments, after full, partial, or selective hydrogenation, the hydrogenation catalyst may be removed from the hydrogenated product 52 using known techniques in the art, for example, by filtration. In some embodiments, the hydrogenation catalyst is removed using a plate and frame filter such as those commercially available from Sparkler Filters, Inc., Conroe Tex. In some embodiments, the filtration is performed with the assistance of pressure or a vacuum. In order to improve filtering performance, a filter aid may be used. A filter aid may be added to the product directly or it may be applied to the filter. Representative non-limiting examples of filtering aids include diatomaceous earth, silica, alumina, and carbon. Typically, the filtering aid is used in an amount of about 10 weight % or less, for example, about 5 weight % or less or about 1 weight % or less. Other filtering techniques and filtering aids also may be employed to remove the used hydrogenation catalyst. In other embodiments the hydrogenation catalyst is removed using centrifugation followed by decantation of the product. In certain embodiments, based upon the quality of the hydrogenated product 52 produced in the hydrogenation unit 50, it may be preferable to isomerize the olefin hydrogenated product 52 to assist in targeting of desired product properties such as flash point, freeze point, energy density, cetane number, or end point distillation temperature, among other parameters. Isomerization reactions are well-known in the art, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,150,205; 4,210,771; 5,095,169; and 6,214,764, herein incorporated by reference in their entireties. In one embodiment, the isomerization reaction at this stage may also crack some of the C15+ compounds remaining, which may further assist in producing a fuel composition having compounds within the desired carbon number range, such as 5 to 16 for a jet fuel composition. In certain embodiments, the isomerization may occur concurrently with the hydrogenation step in the hydrogenation unit 50, thereby targeting a desired product. In other embodiments, the isomerization step may occur before the hydrogenation step (i.e., the olefins 32 or center-cut olefins 42 may be isomerized before the hydrogenation unit 50). In yet other embodiments, it is possible that the isomerization step may be avoided or reduced in scope based upon the selection of low-molecular-weight olefin(s) 14 and/or mid-weight olefin(s) 15 used in the metathesis reaction. In certain embodiments, the hydrogenated product 52 is a partially or selectively hydrogenated product stream that comprises approximately 15-25 weight % C7, approximately <5 weight % C8, approximately 20-40 weight % C9, approximately 20-40 weight % C10, approximately <5 weight % C11, approximately 15-25 weight % C12, approximately <5 weight % C13, approximately <5 weight % C14, approximately <5 weight % C15, approximately <1 weight % C16, approximately <1 weight % C17, and approximately <1 weight % C18+. As shown in FIG. 1, the hydrogenated product 52 may be further processed in a separation unit 60, removing any remaining byproducts from the hydrogenated product 52, such as hydrogen gas, water, light end C2-C9 hydrocarbons, or C15+ hydrocarbons, thereby producing a targeted composition. The separation unit 60 may comprise a number of distillation towers. In some embodiments, the various composition streams are separated using at least four distillation towers. In other embodiments, three towers or less are used. In one embodiment, the hydrogenated product 52 may be separated into various product cuts, such as a C9-C15 product 64, a light-ends C2-C9 fraction 62, and/or a C15+ heavy-ends fraction 66. Distillation may be used to separate the fractions. Alternatively, in other embodiments, the heavy ends fraction 66 can be separated from the C9-C15 product 64 by cooling the hydrogenated product 52 to approximately −40° C., −47° C., or −65° C. and then removing the solid, heavy ends fraction 66 by techniques known in the art such as filtration, decantation, or centrifugation. With regard to the esters 34 from the distillation unit 30, in certain embodiments, the esters 34 may be entirely withdrawn as an ester product stream 36 and processed further or sold for its own value, as shown in FIG. 1. As a non-limiting example, the esters 34 may comprise various triglycerides that could be used as a lubricant. Based upon the quality of separation between olefins and esters, the esters 34 may comprise some heavier olefin components carried with the triglycerides. In other embodiments, the esters 34 may be further processed in a biorefinery or another chemical or fuel processing unit known in the art, thereby producing various products such as biodiesel or specialty chemicals that have higher value than that of the triglycerides, for example. Alternatively, in certain embodiments, the esters 34 may be partially withdrawn from the system and sold, with the remainder further processed in the biorefinery or another chemical or fuel processing unit known in the art. In some embodiments, the esters 34 may be pre-treated to remove potential catalyst poisons prior to further processing. Examples of potential feedstock pretreatments (such as adsorbants, alumina, or heat) for the esters 34 are described above with regard to potential treatment of the natural oil 12. In certain embodiments, the esters 34 may be selectively hydrogenated to decrease the presence of polyunsaturated esters and increase the presence of monounsaturated esters. Typical reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, time of reaction, and hydrogenation catalyst type, are described above with regard to selective hydrogenation of the metathesis product 22. In certain embodiments, in the diene selective hydrogenation, the conversion rate from polyunsaturated esters to saturated and monounsaturated esters may be at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 85%, at least 95%, or at least 98%. The selectivity towards monounsaturated esters instead of saturated esters is at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99%, or at least 99.5%. In certain embodiments, the ester stream 34 (which has been selectively hydrogenated in some embodiments) is sent to a transesterification unit 70. Within the transesterification unit 70, the esters 34 are reacted with at least one alcohol 38 in the presence of a transesterification catalyst. In certain embodiments, the alcohol comprises methanol and/or ethanol. In another embodiment, the alcohol 38 comprises glycerol (and the transesterification reaction is a glycerolysis reaction). In one embodiment, the transesterification reaction is conducted at approximately 60-70° C. and approximately 1 atm. In certain embodiments, the transesterification catalyst is a homogeneous sodium methoxide catalyst. Varying amounts of catalyst may be used in the reaction, and, in certain embodiments, the transesterification catalyst is present in the amount of approximately 0.5-1.0 weight % of the esters 34. In certain embodiments, the transesterification reaction may produce a transesterified product 72 comprising monomer terminal olefin esters having the following structure: where X is a C3-C18 saturated or unsaturated alkyl chain, and R is an alkyl group. In some embodiments, R is methyl. The transesterification reaction may produce transesterified products 72 including saturated and/or unsaturated monomer fatty acid methyl esters (“FAME”), glycerin, methanol, and/or free fatty acids. In certain embodiments, the transesterified products 72, or a fraction thereof, may comprise a source for biodiesel. In certain embodiments, the transesterified products 72 comprise C10-C15 or C11-C14 esters. In certain embodiments, the transesterified products 72 comprise 9DA esters, 9UDA esters, and/or 9DDA esters. Non-limiting examples of 9DA esters, 9UDA esters and 9DDA esters include methyl 9-decenoate (“9-DAME”), methyl 9-undecenoate (“9-UDAME”), and methyl 9-dodecenoate (“9-DDAME”), respectively. As a non-limiting example, in a transesterification reaction, a 9DA moiety of a metathesized glyceride is removed from the glycerol backbone to form a 9DA ester. As discussed above, the types of transesterified products formed are based upon the reactants entering the metathesis reactor 20. In one particular embodiment, C12 methyl esters (9-DDAME) are produced downstream of the metathesis reaction between 3-hexene and a natural oil. In another embodiment, a glycerin alcohol may be used in the reaction with a glyceride stream. This reaction may produce monoglycerides and/or diglycerides. In certain embodiments, the transesterified products 72 from the transesterification unit 70 can be sent to a liquid-liquid separation unit, wherein the transesterified products 72 (i.e., FAME, free fatty acids, and/or alcohols) are separated from glycerin. Additionally, in certain embodiments, the glycerin byproduct stream may be further processed in a secondary separation unit, wherein the glycerin is removed and any remaining alcohols are recycled back to the transesterification unit 70 for further processing. In certain embodiments, the transesterified products 72 can be sent to a hydrogenation unit for selective hydrogenation, wherein the concentration of monounsaturated esters is increased by diene-selective hydrogenation. Typical reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, time of reaction, and hydrogenation catalyst type, are described above with regard to selective hydrogenation of the metathesis product 22. In certain embodiments, in the diene selective hydrogenation, the conversion rate from the transesterified polyunsaturated esters to saturated and monounsaturated transesterified esters may be at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 85%, at least 95%, or at least 98%. The selectivity towards the monounsaturated esters instead of saturated esters is at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99%, or at least 99.5%. In one embodiment, the transesterified products 72 are further processed in a water-washing unit. In this unit, the transesterified products undergo a liquid-liquid extraction when washed with water. Excess alcohol, water, and glycerin are removed from the transesterified products 72. In another embodiment, the water-washing step is followed by a drying unit in which excess water is further removed from the desired mixture of esters (i.e., specialty chemicals). Such specialty chemicals include non-limiting examples such as 9DA, 9UDA, and/or 9DDA, alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts of the preceding, individually or in combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the monomer specialty chemical (e.g., 9DA) may be further processed in an oligomerization reaction to form a lactone, which may serve as a precursor to a surfactant. In certain embodiments, the transesterifed products 72 from the transesterification unit 70 or specialty chemicals from the water-washing unit or drying unit are sent to an ester distillation column 80 for further separation of various individual or groups of compounds, as shown in FIG. 1. This separation may include, but is not limited to, the separation of 9DA esters, 9UDA esters, and/or 9DDA esters. In one embodiment, the 9DA ester 82 may be distilled or individually separated from the remaining mixture 84 of transesterified products or specialty chemicals. In certain process conditions, the 9DA ester 82 should be the lightest component in the transesterified product or specialty chemical stream, and come out at the top of the ester distillation column 80. In another embodiment, the remaining mixture 84, or heavier components, of the transesterified products or specialty chemicals may be separated off the bottom end of the column. In certain embodiments, this bottoms stream 84 may potentially be sold as biodiesel. The 9DA esters, 9UDA esters, and/or 9DDA esters may be further processed after the distillation step in the ester distillation column. In one embodiment, under known operating conditions, the 9DA ester, 9UDA ester, and/or 9DDA ester may then undergo a hydrolysis reaction with water to form 9DA, 9UDA, and/or 9DDA, alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts of the preceding, individually or in combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the monomer fatty acid esters from the transesterified products 72 may be reacted with each other to form other specialty chemicals such as dimers. In other embodiments, specific ester products, such as 9DDA methyl ester, may be enriched through subsequent processing and reaction steps of the transesterified products. In one embodiment, a C10 methyl ester stream may be separated from heavier C12+ methyl esters. The C10 methyl ester stream may then be reacted with 1-butene in the presence of a metathesis catalyst to form C12 methyl esters and ethylene. The ethylene may be separated from the methyl esters and the C10 and C12 methyl esters may be removed or returned to an ester distillation column for further processing. In certain embodiments, the monomer fatty acids and/or monomer fatty acid esters from the transesterified products 72 are isomerized to form isomerized monomer fatty acids and/or isomerized monomer fatty acid esters. The isomerization of the fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters from the transesterified products 72 may be conducted at an elevated temperature (i.e., greater than 25° C.). In certain embodiments, the temperature of the heat treatment for the isomerization reaction is greater than 100° C., greater than 150° C., or greater than 200° C. In other embodiments, the temperature is between 100° C.-300° C., between 150-250° C., or about 200° C. In some embodiments, the heat treatment step is conducted in the presence of an isomerization catalyst. In one particular embodiment, the isomerization catalyst is (PCy3)2(Cl)(H)Ru(CO), where “Cy” represents a cyclohexyl group. In certain embodiments, the monomer fatty acids and/or monomer fatty acid esters that undergo the isomerization reaction are selected from the group consisting of: 9DA, 9DA esters, 9UDA, 9UDA esters, 9DDA, and 9DDA esters. The isomerization of the fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters may produce isomerized monomer fatty acids and/or isomerized monomer fatty acid esters selected from the group consisting of isomerized 9DA, isomerized 9DA esters, isomerized 9UDA, isomerized 9UDA esters, isomerized 9DDA, and isomerized 9DDA esters. Isomerizing the monomer fatty acids and/or monomer fatty acid esters may improve various performance properties. For example, the isomerized product composition may have an observed broadening of the freezing and melting points, which may allow for transportation of the isomerized fatty acid/ester product composition at higher concentrations of the monomer fatty acids and/or monomer fatty acid esters without incurring shipping problems. Isomerized monomer fatty acids and/or isomerized monomer fatty acid esters may be used in a variety of different commercial applications, including, but not limited to: lubricants, waxes, films, paints, paint strippers, coatings, plasticizers, resins, binders, solvents, polyols, soil stabilization, chemical grouting, oilfield drilling fluids, crop protection products, surfactants, intermediates, and adhesives. In certain embodiments, the transesterified product 72 comprises terminal olefin esters and is cross-metathesized with an internal olefin in the presence of a metathesis catalyst to produce a dibasic acid and/or dibasic ester, as well as an olefin byproduct. As mentioned above, the transesterified product 72 may comprise terminal olefins having the following structure: where X is a C3-C18 saturated or unsaturated alkyl chain, and R is an alkyl group or hydrogen. In certain embodiments, the terminal olefin-internal olefin cross-metathesis reaction is conducted at a weight ratio between 1:99 (terminal to internal) and 99:1 (terminal to internal). In other embodiments, the weight ratio of the terminal and internal olefin is between 1:5 and 5:1. In yet other embodiments, the weight ratio between the terminal and internal olefin is between 1:2 and 2:1. In one particular embodiment, the weight ratio between the terminal and internal olefin is approximately 1:1. In certain embodiments, the terminal olefin is selected from the group consisting of: 4-pentenoic acid ester, 5-hexenoic acid ester, 6-heptenoic acid ester, 7-octenoic acid ester, 8-nonenoic acid ester, 9-decenoic acid ester, 10-undecenoic acid ester, 11-dodecenoic acid ester, 12-tridecenoic acid ester, 13-tetradecenoic acid ester, 14-pentadecenoic acid ester, 15-hexadecenoic acid ester, 16-heptadecenoic acid ester, 17-octadecenoic acid ester, acids thereof, and mixtures thereof. In one particular embodiment, the terminal olefin is 9-decenoic acid ester. In certain embodiments, the terminal olefin is cross-metathesized with an internal olefin selected from the group consisting of: pentenoic acid esters, hexenoic acid esters, heptenoic acid esters, octenoic acid esters, nonenoic acid esters, decenoic acid esters, undecenoic acid esters, dodecenoic acid esters, tridecenoic acid esters, tetradecenoic acid esters, pentadecenoic acid esters, hexadecenoic acid esters, heptadecenoic acid esters, octadecenoic acid esters, acids thereof, and mixtures thereof. In one particular embodiment, the internal olefin is 9-undecenoic acid ester. In another particular embodiment, the internal olefin is 9-dodecenoic acid ester. In some embodiments, the internal olefin is formed by reacting a portion of the terminal olefin ester derived from the transesterified product 72 with a low-molecular-weight internal olefin or mid-weight internal olefin in the presence of a metathesis catalyst. In certain embodiments, the low-molecular-weight internal olefin is selected from the group consisting of: 2-butene, 2-pentene, 2-hexene, 3-hexene, 2-heptene, 3-heptene, 2-octene, 3-octene, 4-octene, 2-nonene, 3-nonene, 4-nonene, and mixtures thereof. In one particular embodiment, the low-molecular-weight internal olefin is 2-butene. In another particular embodiment, the low-molecular-weight internal olefin is 3-hexene. In certain embodiments, at least 70 wt %, 80 wt %, or 90 wt % dibasic ester and/or dibasic acid is formed from the cross-metathesis reaction of a terminal olefin and an internal olefin in the presence of less than 150 ppm, 100 ppm, 50 ppm, 25 ppm, or 10 ppm catalyst. A comparable self-metathesis reaction with terminal olefins (such as 9-decenoic acid ester) under similar reaction conditions may require more catalyst (e.g., more than 150 ppm, or more than 500 ppm) to achieve similar yields of dibasic esters and/or dibasic acids (potentially due to the formation of the ethylene byproduct). In certain embodiments, the dibasic ester and/or dibasic acid yield is improved by separating the olefin byproduct formed in the cross-metathesis reaction from the metathesis product while the reaction between the terminal olefin and internal olefin is ongoing. In other embodiments, the dibasic ester and/or dibasic acid yield is improved by sparging the metathesis products in the metathesis reactor with a chemically inert gas (e.g., nitrogen, argon, or helium) to ventilate dissolved gases/byproducts (e.g., olefin byproducts) in the metathesis product. In certain embodiments, the cross-metathesis reaction of the terminal olefin and internal olefin produces a dibasic ester comprising the following structure: wherein R and R′ are independently alkyl or aryl groups, and Y is an olefin comprising between 6 and 36 carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the cross-metathesis reaction forms a C21-C24 dibasic ester. In one embodiment, the cross-metathesis reaction forms a dibasic ester, where R and R′ are methyl and Y is 8-hexadecene (i.e., the dibasic ester formed from the cross-metathesis reaction of a terminal olefin and an internal olefin is dimethyl 9-octadecenedioate). In some embodiments, these dibasic esters would be selectively hydrogenated to increase the concentration of monounsaturated dibasic esters. In some embodiments, the dibasic ester derived from the transesterified product 72 may further undergo a hydrolysis reaction with water to form a dibasic acid having the following structure: wherein Y is an olefin comprising between 6 and 36 carbon atoms. In one embodiment, Y is 8-hexadecene (i.e., the dibasic acid is 9-octadecene dioic acid). Following hydrolysis, in some embodiments, the product stream may be sent to a flash column or decanter to remove methanol and water from the diacid. In other embodiments, the dibasic acid and/or dibasic ester is isomerized to form an isomerized dibasic acid and/or isomerized dibasic ester. The isomerization of the dibasic acid and/or dibasic ester may be conducted at an elevated temperature (i.e., greater than 25° C.). In certain embodiments, the temperature of the heat treatment for the isomerization reaction is greater than 100° C., greater than 150° C., or greater than 200° C. In other embodiments, the temperature is between 100° C.-300° C., between 150-250° C., or about 200° C. In some embodiments, the heat treatment step is conducted in the presence of an isomerization catalyst. In one particular embodiment, the isomerization catalyst is (PCy3)2(Cl)(H)Ru(CO), where “Cy” represents a cyclohexyl group. In certain embodiments, the isomerized dibasic acid and/or isomerized dibasic ester comprises compounds selected from the group consisting of: isomerized dimethyl 9-octadecenedioate or isomerized 9-octadecene dioic acid. In certain embodiments, the isomerized dibasic acid and/or isomerized dibasic ester is self-metathesized or cross-metathesized with a low-molecular-weight olefin or mid-weight olefin. Typical metathesis reaction conditions and catalysts are discussed in greater detail below. In one embodiment, the isomerized dibasic acid and/or isomerized dibasic ester is self-metathesized in the presence of approximately 10 ppm, 20 ppm, 40 ppm, 50 ppm, 80 ppm, 100 ppm, 120 ppm, or greater than 150 ppm metathesis catalyst. In certain embodiments, the isomerized fatty acid, isomerized fatty acid ester, dibasic acid, dibasic ester, isomerized dibasic acid, and/or isomerized dibasic ester is fully hydrogenated. Typical hydrogenation reaction conditions and catalysts are discussed above. In one particular embodiment, the hydrogenation reaction is conducted in the presence of a nickel based catalyst at approximately 150° C. and 150 psig. In another embodiment, the hydrogenation reaction is conducted in the presence of a nickel based catalyst at approximately 150° C. and 100 psig. In certain embodiments, these dibasic materials are selectively hydrogenated to increase the concentration of monounsaturated compounds. As noted, the self-metathesis of the natural oil, cross-metathesis between the natural oil and low-molecular-weight olefin or mid-weight olefin, or cross-metathesis between a terminal olefin and internal olefin occurs in the presence of a metathesis catalyst. As stated previously, the term “metathesis catalyst” includes any catalyst or catalyst system that catalyzes a metathesis reaction. Any known or future-developed metathesis catalyst may be used, individually or in combination with one or more additional catalysts. Non-limiting exemplary metathesis catalysts and process conditions are described in PCT/US2008/009635, pp. 18-47, incorporated by reference herein. A number of the metathesis catalysts as shown are manufactured by Materia, Inc. (Pasadena, Calif.). The metathesis process can be conducted under any conditions adequate to produce the desired metathesis products. For example, stoichiometry, atmosphere, solvent, temperature, and pressure can be selected by one skilled in the art to produce a desired product and to minimize undesirable byproducts. The metathesis process may be conducted under an inert atmosphere. Similarly, if a reagent is supplied as a gas, an inert gaseous diluent can be used. The inert atmosphere or inert gaseous diluent typically is an inert gas, meaning that the gas does not interact with the metathesis catalyst to substantially impede catalysis. For example, particular inert gases are selected from the group consisting of helium, neon, argon, nitrogen, individually or in combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, the metathesis catalyst is dissolved in a solvent prior to conducting the metathesis reaction. In certain embodiments, the solvent chosen may be selected to be substantially inert with respect to the metathesis catalyst. For example, substantially inert solvents include, without limitation, aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylenes, etc.; halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene; aliphatic solvents, including pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, etc.; and chlorinated alkanes, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane, etc. In one particular embodiment, the solvent comprises toluene. In other embodiments, the metathesis catalyst is not dissolved in a solvent prior to conducting the metathesis reaction. The catalyst, instead, may be slurried with the natural oil 12, where the natural oil 12 is in a liquid state. Under these conditions, it is possible to eliminate the solvent (e.g., toluene) from the process and eliminate downstream olefin losses when separating the solvent. In other embodiments, the metathesis catalyst may be added in solid state form (and not slurried) to the natural oil 12 (e.g., as an auger feed). The metathesis reaction temperature may be a rate-controlling variable where the temperature is selected to provide a desired product at an acceptable rate. In certain embodiments, the metathesis reaction temperature is greater than about −40° C., greater than about −20° C., greater than about 0° C., or greater than about 10° C. In certain embodiments, the metathesis reaction temperature is less than about 150° C., or less than about 120° C. In one embodiment, the metathesis reaction temperature is between about 10° C. and about 120° C. The metathesis reaction can be run under any desired pressure. Typically, it will be desirable to maintain a total pressure that is high enough to keep the cross-metathesis reagent in solution. Therefore, as the molecular weight of the cross-metathesis reagent increases, the lower pressure range typically decreases since the boiling point of the cross-metathesis reagent increases. The total pressure may be selected to be greater than about 0.1 atm (10 kPa), in some embodiments greater than about 0.3 atm (30 kPa), or greater than about 1 atm (100 kPa). Typically, the reaction pressure is no more than about 70 atm (7000 kPa), in some embodiments no more than about 30 atm (3000 kPa). A non-limiting exemplary pressure range for the metathesis reaction is from about 1 atm (100 kPa) to about 30 atm (3000 kPa). While the invention as described may have modifications and alternative forms, various embodiments thereof have been described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the description herein of these various embodiments is not intended to limit the invention, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims. Further, while the invention will also be described with reference to the following non-limiting examples, it will be understood, of course, that the invention is not limited thereto since modifications may be made by those skilled in the art, particularly in light of the foregoing teachings.
