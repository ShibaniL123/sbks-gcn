CANCER THERAPY CROSS-REFERENCE [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/769,623, filed February 26, 2013, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Proliferative diseases are a serious threat to modem society. Cancerous growths, including malignant cancerous growth, pose serious challenges for modem medicine due to their unique characteristics. Their characteristics include uncontrollable cell proliferation resulting in, for example, unregulated growth of malignant tissue, an ability to invade local and even remote tissues, lack of differentiation, lack of detectable symptoms and most significantly, the lack of effective therapy and prevention. [0003] Cancer can develop in any tissue of any organ at any age. The etiology of cancer is not clearly defined but mechanisms such as genetic susceptibility, chromosome breakage disorders, vimses, environmental factors and immunologic disorders have all been linked to a malignant cell growth and transformation. Cancer encompasses a large category of medical conditions, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Cancer cells can arise in almost any organ and/or tissue of the body. Cancer develops when cells in a part of the body begin to grow or differentiate out of control. All cancer types begin with the out-of-control growth of abnormal cells. [0004] Currently, some of the main treatments available are surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Surgery is often a drastic measure and can have serious consequences. For example, all treatments for ovarian cancer may result in infertility. Some treatments for cervical cancer and bladder cancer may cause infertility and/or sexual dysfunction. Surgical procedures to treat pancreatic cancer may result in partial or total removal of the pancreas can itself carry significant risks, causing serious adverse effects to the patient. Breast cancer surgery invariably involves removal of part of or the entire breast. Some surgical procedures for prostate cancer carry the risk of urinary incontinence and impotence. The procedures for lung cancer patients often have significant post-operative pain as the ribs must be cut through to access and remove the cancerous lung tissue. In addition, patients who have both lung cancer and another lung disease, such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, typically experience an increase in their shortness of breath following the surgery. [0005] Worldwide, more than 10 million people are diagnosed with cancer every year and it is estimated that this number will grow to 15 million new cases every year by 2020. Cancer causes six million deaths every year or 12% of the deaths worldwide.

XIC (m/z=557.1338) traces of the peaks of putative metabolites M2 and M3i (net gain of 255.9893) in plasma samples. FIG. 5 shows XIC detection of the pool of putative metabolites M2 and M3i across data points in the plasma of dosed animals, and the lack thereof in control plasma samples. The “hill-like” appearance of the peaks of M3i could be either due to the presence of multiple isomers (most likely), or tautomerization/isomerization during chromatography and/or column overload (less likely). The formal gain of 255.9893 u implies the occurrence of complex conjugative metabolism. The putative metabolites M2 and M3i could be rationalized as the net results of mono-glucuronidation (+176.0321) plus sulfation (+ 79.9568), resulting in conjugates at m/z = (301.1445 + 176.0321 + 79.9568) = 557.1334 u. Such conjugates typically show extremely facile loss of sulfate or/and glucuronic moieties during ionization in positive mode, and indeed sample analysis using positive mode (LC method I) did not lead to the detection of the peaks at “nominal” m/z= 559.2 (protonated M2 and M3i). Instead, “hill-like” peaks of the parent were detected as seen in FIG. 6.

Recorded MS2 spectrum of metabolite Μ7 is in agreement with the proposed structure.

However, the DDA triggered MS2 data acquisition on the 13 C isotopomer of Μ7 (m/z=492.2), the spectrum of which is shown above.

[00115] Definition of standard chemistry terms may be found in reference works, including Carey and Sundberg “Advanced Organic Chemistry 4th Ed.” Vols. A (2000) and Β (2001), Plenum Press, New York. Unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of mass spectroscopy (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high phase liquid chromatography (HPLC), infrared (IR) UV/Vis spectroscopy, and pharmacology, or HPLC-MS within the skill of the art are employed. Unless specific definitions are provided, the nomenclature employed in connection with, and the laboratory procedures and techniques of, analytical chemistry, synthetic organic chemistry, and medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry described herein are those known in the art. Standard techniques can be used for chemical syntheses, chemical analyses, pharmaceutical preparation, formulation, and delivery, and treatment of patients. Reactions and purification techniques can be performed e.g., using kits of manufacturer's specifications or as commonly accomplished in the art or as described herein. The foregoing techniques and procedures can be generally performed of conventional methods well known in the art and as described in various general and more specific references that are cited and discussed throughout the present specification. Throughout the specification, groups and substituents thereof can be chosen by one skilled in the field to provide stable moieties and compounds. [00116] The compounds presented herein may exist as tautomers. Tautomers are compounds that are interconvertible by migration of a hydrogen atom, accompanied by a switch of a single bond and adjacent double bond. In solutions where tautomerization is possible, a chemical equilibrium of the tautomers will exist. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature, solvent, and pH. Some examples of tautomeric pairs include: [00117] The term “pharmaceutically acceptable derivative or prodrug” as used herein, refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, salt of an ester or other derivative of a compound, which, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing (either directly or indirectly) a pharmaceutically active metabolite or residue thereof. Particularly favored derivatives or prodrugs are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds when such compounds are administered to a patient (e.g., by allowing orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed into blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a biological compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic system). [00118] The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” as used herein, refers to salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free acids and bases of the specified compound and that are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. Compounds described herein may possess acidic or basic groups and therefore may react with any of a number of inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds, or by separately reacting a purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those salts prepared by reaction of the compound with a mineral or organic acid or an inorganic base, such salts including, acetate, acrylate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, bisulfite, bromide, butyrate, butyn-l,4-dioate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, caproate, caprylate, chlorobenzoate, chloride, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, decanoate, digluconate, dihydrogenphosphate, dinitrobenzoate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, glycolate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hexyne-l,6-dioate, hydroxybenzoate, y-hydroxybutyrate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, iodide, isobutyrate, lactate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, mandelate, metaphosphate, methanesulfonate, methoxybenzoate, methylbenzoate, monohydrogen phosphate, 1-napthalenesulfonate, 2-napthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, palmoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, pyrosulfate, pyrophosphate, propiolate, phthalate, phenylacetate, phenylbutyrate, propanesulfonate, salicylate, succinate, sulfate, sulfite, succinate, suberate, sebacate, sulfonate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate undeconate and xylenesulfonate. Other acids, such as oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be employed in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds described herein and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. See, for example, Berge et αℓ., J. Pharm. Sci. 1977, 66, 1-19. Further, those compounds described herein which may comprise a free acid group may react with a suitable base, such as the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation, with ammonia, or with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Representative alkali or alkaline earth salts include the lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum salts and the like. Illustrative examples of bases include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, choline hydroxide, sodium carbonate, N+(Cl-4 alkyl)4, and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethyl amine, diethyl amine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperazine and the like. It should be understood that compounds also include the quatemization of any basic nitrogen-containing groups they may contain. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products may be obtained by such quatemization. See, for example, Berge et αℓ., supra. [00119] Catecholic butanes metabolites can also exist in various polymorphic states, all of which are herein contemplated, and which can also be useful for treating disorders. For example, polymorphs of catecholic butane metabolites may be administered in embodiments of the methods described herein. Catecholic butane metabolites include, for example, all crystalline forms (known as polymorphs). Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of the compound. Polymorphs can have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, solvates and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature can cause a single crystal form to dominate. The various polymorphs can be administered as pharmaceutical compositions. [00120] In pharmaceutical dosage forms, active agents may be administered in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or they may also be used alone or in appropriate association, as well as in combination, with other pharmaceutically active compounds. The following methods and excipients are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting. Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount of active compound are known or will be apparent to those skilled in this art. For examples, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Ester, Pa., 18th Edition (1990). [00121] The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as vehicles, adjuvants, carriers or diluents, are conventional in the art. Suitable excipient vehicles are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, or the like, and combinations thereof. In addition, if desired, the vehicle may contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, stabilizers, wetting agents or emulsifying agents. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 17th edition, 1985. The composition or formulation to be administered will, in any event, contain a quantity of the agent adequate to achieve the desired state in the subject being treated. [00122] The active agents can be formulated into preparations for injection by dissolving, suspending or emulsifying them in an aqueous or non-aqueous solvent, such as vegetable or other similar oils, including com oil, castor oil, synthetic aliphatic acid glycerides, esters of higher aliphatic acids or propylene glycol; and if desired, with conventional additives such as solubilizers, isotonic agents, suspending agents, emulsifying agents, stabilizers and preservatives. [00123] Aqueous suspensions contain the active material in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents can be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethylene-oxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions can also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame. [00124] Pharmaceutical preparations can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions can take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and can contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. The formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and can be stored in powder form or in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or sterile pyrogen-free water, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. [00125] Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous (oily) sterile injection solutions of the active compounds which can contain antioxidants, buffers, biocide, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which can include suspending agents and thickening agents. Examples of suitable isotonic vehicles for use in such formulations include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Solution, or Lactated Ringer's Injection. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes or other microparticulate systems can be used to target the compound to blood components or one or more organs. The concentration of the active ingredient in the solution can vary widely. Typically, the concentration of the active ingredient in the solution is from about 1 ng/ml to about 10 pg/ml, for example from about 10 ng/ml to about 1 pg/ml. Aqueous injection suspensions can contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension can also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions [00126] Pharmaceutical preparations can also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations can be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt. [00127] For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions can take the form of tablets, lozenges, pastilles, or gels formulated in conventional manner. Such compositions can comprise the active ingredient in a flavored basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth. [00128] Pharmaceutical preparations can be administered topically, that is by non-systemic administration. This includes the application of the compositions externally to the epidermis or the buccal cavity and the instillation of such compound into the ear, eye and nose, such that the compound does not significantly enter the blood stream. In contrast, systemic administration refers to oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal and intramuscular administration. [00129] Pharmaceutical preparations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semiliquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin to the site of inflammation such as gels, liniments, lotions, creams, ointments or pastes, suspensions, powders, solutions, spray, aerosol, oil, and drops suitable for administration to the eye, ear or nose. Alternatively, a formulation can comprise a patch or a dressing such as a bandage or adhesive plaster impregnated with active ingredients and optionally one or more excipients or diluents. The amount of active ingredient present in the topical formulation can vary widely. The active ingredient can comprise, for topical administration, from 0.001% to 10% w/w, for instance from 1% to 2% by weight of the formulation. It can however comprise as much as 10% w/w but preferably will comprise less than 5% w/w, more preferably from 0.1% to 1% w/w of the formulation. [00130] Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier. [00131] Formulations suitable for topical administration to the eye also include eye drops wherein the active ingredient is dissolved or suspended in a suitable carrier, especially an aqueous solvent for the active ingredient. [00132] The active agents can be utilized in aerosol formulation to be administered via inhalation. [00133] The compounds of the present embodiments may be formulated into pressurized acceptable propellants such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, nitrogen and the like. [00134] Furthermore, the active agents can be made into suppositories by mixing with a variety of bases such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases. The compounds of the present embodiments may be administered rectally via a suppository. The suppository can include vehicles such as cocoa butter, carbowaxes and polyethylene glycols, which melt at body temperature, yet are solidified at room temperature. [00135] For oral preparations, the active agents can be used alone or in combination with appropriate additives to make tablets, powders, granules or capsules with conventional additives, such as lactose, mannitol, com starch or potato starch; with binders, such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, com starch or gelatins; with disintegrators, such as com starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethylcellulose; with lubricants, such as talc or magnesium stearate; and if desired, with diluents, buffering agents, moistening agents, preservatives and flavoring agents. For oral rinses, the preparations can be made in a manner conventional in the art. [00136] Unit dosage forms for oral or rectal administration such as syrups, elixirs, and suspensions may be provided wherein each dosage unit, for example, teaspoonful, tablespoonful, tablet or suppository, contains a predetermined amount of the composition containing one or more inhibitors. Similarly, unit dosage forms for injection or intravenous administration may comprise the inhibitor(s) in a composition as a solution in sterile water, normal saline or another pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. [00137] Some catecholic butane metabolites are water-soluble, hydrophilic compounds. Some embodiments include formulation of hydrophilic compounds in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient and delivery of such as oral formulations, such as in the form of an aqueous liquid solution of the compound, or the compounds can be lyophilized and delivered as a powder, made into a tablet, or the compounds can be encapsulated. [00138] The tablets herein can be enteric coated tablets. The formulations herein can be sustained release, either slow release or rapid release formulations. [00139] The amount of the catecholic butane metabolites be included in the oral formulations can be adjusted depending on the desired dose to be administered to a subject. Such an adjustment is within the skill of persons conventional in the art. [00140] Some catecholic butane metabolites are hydrophobic or lipophilic compounds. The absorption of lipophilic compounds in the gut can be improved by using pharmaceutically acceptable carriers that can enhance the rate or extent of solubilization of the compound into the aqueous intestinal fluid. Lipidic carriers are known in the art. The formulations herein can be delivered as oral liquids or can be encapsulated into various types of capsules. [00141] The present embodiments include, in one example, a formulation containing lipophilic catecholic butane metabolites that are formulated for oral delivery by dissolution of such compounds in triacylglycerols, and the formulation is then encapsulated for oral delivery. Triacyglycerols are molecules with long chain and/or medium chain fatty acids linked to a glycerol molecule. The long chain fatty acids range from about C14 to C24, and can be found in common fat. The medium chain fatty acids range from about Ce to C12, and can be found in coconut oil or palm kernel oil. Triacylglycerols suitable for use herein include structured lipids that contain mixtures of either short-chain or medium chain fatty acids or both, esterified on the same glycerol molecule. [00142] In another embodiment, one or more surfactants can be added to a mixture of catecholic butane metabolites and lipidic carrier such that the drug is present in fine droplets of oil/surfactant mix. The surfactants can act to disperse the oily formulation on dilution in the gastrointestinal fluid. [00143] The present embodiments also include a formulation for oral delivery of the catecholic butane metabolites in the form of a micro-emulsion consisting of hydrophilic surfactant and oil. The micro-emulsion particles can be surfactant micelles containing solubilized oil and drug. [00144] Formulations suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient can also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste. [00145] Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include tablets, push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. Tablets can be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with binders (e.g., povidone, gelatin, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose), inert diluents, preservative, disintegrant (e.g., sodium starch glycolate, cross-linked povidone, cross-linked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose) or lubricating, surface active or dispersing agents. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets can optionally be coated or scored and can be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. Tablets can optionally be provided with an enteric coating, to provide release in parts of the gut other than the stomach. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds can be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers can be added. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions can be used, which can optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments can be added to the tablets or Dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses. [00146] Also suitable for oral administration are formulations of the catecholic butane metabolites in a solid lipid nanoparticle preparation. Solid lipid nanoparticles can be prepared in any manner conventional in the art. [00147] In one embodiment, the solid lipid nanoparticle can be prepared in a hot homogenization process by homogenization of melted lipids at elevated temperature. In this process, the solid lipid is melted and the catecholic butan, is dissolved in the melted lipid. A preheated dispersion medium is then mixed with the drug-loaded lipid melt, and the combination is mixed with a homogenisator to form a coarse pre-emulsion. High pressure homogenization is then performed at a temperature above the lipids melting point to produce a oil/waternanoemulsion. The nanoemulsion is cooled down to room temperature to form solid lipid nanoparticles. [00148] In another embodiment, the solid lipid nanoparticles can be prepared in a cold homogenization process. In this process, the lipid is melted and the catecholic butane metabolite is dissolved in the melted lipid. The drug-loaded lipid is then solidified in liquid nitrogen or dry ice. The solid drug-lipid is ground in a powder mill to form 50-100 pm particles. The lipid particles are then dispersed in cold aqueous dispersion medium and homogenized at room temperature or below to form solid lipid nanoparticles. [00149] Also provided herein, in one example, is a formulation of the lipophilic catecholic butane metabolites in liposomes or micelles for oral delivery. These formulations can be made in any manner conventional in the art. Micelles are typically lipid monolayer vesicles in which the hydrophobic drug associates with the hydrophobic regions on the monolayer. Liposomes are typically phospholipids bilayer vesicles. A lipophilic catecholic butane metabolite will typically reside in the center of these vesicles. [00150] Also provided herein, in another example, is a formulation of the catecholic butane metabolites for intravenous administration. Catecholic butanes may be formulated for injection into animals with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Carriers include, but are not limited to one or more solubilizing agents and/or an excipient such as, for example: (a) a water-soluble organic solvent other than dimethyl sulfoxide; provided that when the water-soluble organic solvent is propylene glycol, the propylene glycol is in the absence of white petrolatum, in the absence of xanthan gum (also known as xantham gum and xantham gum) and in the absence of at least one of glycerine or glycine, when the water-soluble organic solvent is polyethylene glycol, the polyethylene glycol is present in the absence of ascorbic acid or butylated hydroxytoluene (“BHT”), and when the polyethylene glycol is polyethylene glycol 400, the polyethylene glycol 400 is present in the absence of polyethylene glycol 8000; (b) a cyclodextrin; (c) an ionic, non-ionic or amphipathic surfactant, provided that when the surfactant is a non-ionic surfactant, the non-ionic surfactant is present in the absence of xanthan gum; (d) a modified cellulose; (℮) a water-insoluble lipid other than castor oil; or a combination of any of the carriers (a)-(e). [00151] Pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous solution. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer’s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable oil-in-water microemulsion where the active ingredient is dissolved in the oily phase. For example, the active ingredient can be first dissolved in a mixture of soybean oil and lecithin. The oil solution then introduced into a water and glycerol mixture and processed to form a microemulsion. The injectable solutions or microemulsions can be introduced into a patient’s blood-stream by local bolus injection. Alternatively, it can be advantageous to administer the solution or microemulsion in such a way as to maintain a constant circulating concentration of the instant compound. In order to maintain such a constant concentration, a continuous intravenous delivery device can be utilized. An example of such a device is the Deltec CADD-PLUS™ model 5400 intravenous pump. The pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension for intramuscular and subcutaneous administration. This suspension can be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. [00152] Also provided herein is a formulation of the catecholic butane metabolites for intra-arterial administration, with or without accompanying blood brain barrier disruption (“BBBD”), and with or without occlusion, such as in hepatic artery chemoemobolization. Briefly, where catecholic butane metabolites are administered intra-arterially with occlusion, primary arteries leading to the target site are catheterized and the catecholic butane metabolites may be applied through a catheter. Embolization of the arteries, in order to retain the catecholic butane metabolites at the target site for a longer period, may be performed using polyvinyl alcohol particles alone or in combination with coils. Intra-arterial delivery of the catecholic butane metabolites may include water soluble compositions. The drugs or agents herein may be dissolved in saline prior to intra-arterial injection and such injection may be preceded by heparin treatment and sedation. [00153] Osmotic disruption of the blood brain barrier (“BBB”) as conventional in the art may accompany intra-arterial delivery of the agents herein. Such a procedure can be used to increase the transfer of drugs into the central nervous system (“CNS”) preferably just prior to intra-arterial delivery. For such disruption, a catheter is placed into an artery, usually the superficial temporal artery, leading to the brain and the BBB is disrupted with a solution of mannitol. This invasive procedure is typically performed while the patient is under general anesthesia. Such treatment may require prior hydration and administration of anticonvulsants and/or atropine. [00154] Also provided herein, in one example, is a formulation of catecholic butane metabolites for intranasal delivery and intranasal delivery thereof. Intranasal delivery may advantageously build up a higher concentration of the active agents in the brain than can be achieved by intravenous administration. Also, this mode of delivery avoids the problem of first pass metabolism in the liver and gut of the subject receiving the drug. [00155] The amount of the active agents that can be absorbed partly depends on the solubility of the drug in the mucus, a composition that consists of about 95% water solution of serum proteins, glycoproteins, lipids and electrolytes. Generally, as lipophilicity of the active agents herein increases, the drug concentration in the CSF also increases. [00156] Hydrophilic catecholic butane metabolites may be dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as saline, phosphate buffer, or phosphate buffered saline. In one embodiment, a 0.05 Μ phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 can be used as the carrier. [00157] Intranasal delivery of the present agents may be optimized by adjusting the position of the subject when administering the agents. For example, the head of the patient may be variously positioned upright-90o, supine-90o, supine-45 °, or supine-70o to obtain maximal effect. [00158] The carrier of the composition of catecholic butane metabolites may be any material that is pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active agents of the composition. Where the carrier is a liquid, it can be hypotonic or isotonic with nasal fluids and within the pH of about 4.5 to about 7.5. Where the carrier is in powdered form it is also within an acceptable pH range. [00159] The carrier composition for intranasal delivery may optionally contain lipophilic substances that may enhance absorption of the active agents across the nasal membrane and into the brain via the olfactory neural pathway. Examples of such lipophilic substances include, but are not limited to, gangliosides and phosphatidylserine. One or several lipophilic adjuvants may be included in the composition, such as, in the form of micelles. [00160] The pharmaceutical composition of active agents for intranasal delivery to a subject for treatment of the diseases, disorders, or conditions herein can be formulated in the manner conventional in the art as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,180,603 which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, the composition herein can be formulated as a powder, granules, solution, aerosol, drops, nanoparticles, or liposomes. In addition to the active agents, the composition may contain appropriate adjuvants, buffers, preservatives, salts. Solutions such as nose drops may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, and the like. [00161] Catecholic butanes may be delivered to a subject for treatment by surgical implantation into a desired site, such as by implantation of a biodegradable polymer containing the catecholic butane metabolite. [00162] Thus, the biodegradable polymer herein can be any polymer or copolymer that would dissolve in the interstitial fluid, without any toxicity or adverse effect on host tissues. Preferably, the polymer or monomers from which the polymer is synthesized is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for administration into humans. A copolymer having monomers of different dissolution properties is preferred so as to control the dynamics of degradation, such as increasing the proportion of one monomer over the other to control rate of dissolution. [00163] In one embodiment, the polymer is a copolymer of l,3-bis-(p-carboxyphenoxy)propane and sebacic acid [p(CPP:SA)], as described in Fleming A. Β. and Saltzman, W. Μ., Pharmacokinetics of the Carmustine Implant, Clin. Pharmacokinet, 41: 403-419 (2002); and Brem, Η. and Gabikian, Ρ. (2001). In another embodiment, the polymer is a copolymer of polyethylene glycol (“PEG”) and sebacic acid, as described in Fu, J. et αℓ., (2002) Biomaterials, 23: 4425-4433. [00164] Polymer delivery systems are applicable to delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic catecholic butane metabolites described herein. The catecholic butane metabolites may be combined with the biodegradable polymers and surgically implanted at the desired or affected site. Some polymer compositions are also usable for intravenous or inhalation therapy herein. [00165] Catecholic butanes may be delivered systemically and/or locally by administration to the lungs through inhalation. Inhalation delivery of drugs has been well accepted as a method of achieving high drug concentration in the pulmonary tissues without triggering substantial systemic toxicity, as well as a method of accomplishing systemic circulation of the drug. The techniques for producing such formulations are conventional in the art. Efficacy against pulmonary diseases may be seen with either hydrophobic or hydrophilic catecholic butane metabolites delivered in this manner. [00166] For pulmonary delivery via inhalation, catecholic butane metabolites may be formulated into dry powders, aqueous solutions, liposomes, nanoparticles, or polymers and administered, for example, as aerosols. Hydrophilic formulations may also be taken up through the alveolar surfaces and into the bloodstream for systemic applications. [00167] In one embodiment, the polymers containing the active agents herein are made and used as described in Fu, J. et αℓ. (2002) supra. For example, the polymers herein can be polymers of sebacic acid and polyethylene glycol (“PEG”), or can be poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (“PLGA”), or polymers of polyethyleneimine (“PEI”) and poly-L-lysine (“PLL”). [00168] In another embodiment, catecholic butane metabolites for inhalation delivery may be dissolved in saline or ethanol before nebulization and administered. [00169] In a further embodiment, the agents herein are also effective when delivered as a dry powder, prepared in the manner conventional in the art. [00170] In one embodiment, delivery of the NDGA compounds may be accomplished with the aid of microprocessors embedded into drug delivery devices, such as, for example, SmartMist™ and AERx™. [00171] The appropriate dose to be administered depends on the subject to be treated, such as the general health of the subject, the age of the subject, the state of the disease or condition, the weight of the subject, the size of the tumor, for example. [00172] Pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated for a route of administration such as, for example, intranasal administration; oral administration; inhalation administration; subcutaneous administration; transdermal administration; intra-arterial administration, with or without occlusion; intracranial administration; intraventricular administration; intravenous administration; buccal administration; intraperitoneal administration; intraocular administration; intramuscular administration; implantation administration; and central venous administration. In one embodiment, the catecholic butane metabolite is formulated for oral administration. In another embodiment, the catecholic butane metabolite is formulated for intravenous administration. [00173] An active agent may be administered in a single or, more typically, multiple doses. Preferred dosages for a given agent are readily determinable by those of skill in the art by a variety of means. Other effective dosages can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art through routine trials establishing dose response curves. The amount of agent will, of course, vary depending upon the particular agent used. [00174] The frequency of administration of the active agent, as with the doses, will be determined by the care giver based on age, weight, disease status, health status and patient responsiveness. Thus, the agents may be administered one or more times daily, weekly, monthly or as appropriate as conventionally determined. The agents may be administered intermittently, such as for a period of days, weeks or months, then not again until some time has passed, such as 3 or 6 months, and then administered again for a period of days, weeks, or months. [00175] Unit dosage forms for injection or intravenous administration may comprise the API in a composition as a solution in sterile water, normal saline or another pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Methods of treatment [00176] The terms “effective amount” or “pharmaceutically effective amount” refer to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the agent to provide the desired biological, therapeutic, and/or prophylactic result. That result can be reduction and/or alleviation of the signs, symptoms, or causes of a disease, or any other desired alteration of a biological system. For example, an “effective amount” for therapeutic uses is the amount of a catecholic butane metabolite as disclosed herein per se or a composition comprising the catecholic butane metabolite herein required to provide a therapeutically significant decrease in a disease. An appropriate effective amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation. [00177] By “pharmaceutically acceptable” or “pharmacologically acceptable” is meant a material which is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, i.e., the material may be administered to an individual without causing any undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the components of the composition in which it is contained. [00178] The term “treating” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein include achieving a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Treating also refers to obtaining a desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect. The effect may be prophylactic in terms of completely or partially preventing a condition or disease or symptom thereof and/or may be therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure for a condition or disease and/or adverse affect attributable to the condition or disease. “Treatment,” thus, for example, covers any treatment of a condition or disease in a mammal, particularly in a human, and includes: (a) preventing the condition or disease from occurring in a subject which may be predisposed to the condition or disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting the condition or disease, such as, arresting its development; and (c) relieving, alleviating or ameliorating the condition or disease, such as, for example, causing regression of the condition or disease. By way of example only, in a cancer patient, therapeutic benefit may include eradication or amelioration of the underlying cancer. Also, a therapeutic benefit may be achieved with the eradication or amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the patient, notwithstanding the fact that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For prophylactic benefit, a method may be performed on, or a composition administered to a patient at risk of developing cancer, or to a patient reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of such conditions, even though a diagnosis of the condition may not have been made. In some instances, treating means stasis (ΐ.℮., that the disease does not get worse) and survival of the patient is prolonged. A dose to be administered depends on the subject to be treated, such as the general health of the subject, the age of the subject, the state of the disease or condition, the weight of the subject, the size of a tumor, for example. [00179] The term “subject,” “patient” or “individual” as used herein in reference to individuals suffering from a disorder, and the like, encompasses mammals and non-mammals. Examples of mammals include, but are not limited to, any member of the Mammalian class: humans, non-human primates such as chimpanzees, and other apes and monkey species; farm animals such as cattle, horses, sheep, goats, swine; domestic animals such as rabbits, dogs, and cats; laboratory animals including rodents, such as rats, mice and guinea pigs, and the like. Examples of non-mammals include, but are not limited to, birds, fish and the like. In some embodiments of the methods and compositions provided herein, the mammal is a human. [00180] As used herein, the terms “co-administration,” “administered in combination with” and their grammatical equivalents or the like are meant to encompass administration of the selected therapeutic agents to a single patient, and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are administered by the same or different route of administration or at the same or different times. In some embodiments, an inhibitor will be co-administered with other agents. These terms encompass administration of two or more agents to an animal so that both agents and/or their metabolites are present in the animal at the same time. They include simultaneous administration in separate compositions, administration at different times in separate compositions, and/or administration in a composition in which both agents are present. Thus, in some embodiments, an inhibitor and the other agent(s) are administered in a single composition. In some embodiments, an inhibitor and the other agent(s) are admixed in the composition. In further embodiments, an inhibitor and the other agent(s) are administered at separate times in separate doses. [00181] The term “pharmaceutical composition,” as used herein, refers to a biologically active compound, optionally mixed with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable chemical component, such as, though not limited to carriers, stabilizers, diluents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, and/or excipients. [00182] The term “carrier” as used herein, refers to relatively nontoxic chemical compounds or agents that facilitate the incorporation of the compound into cells or tissues. [00183] The term “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient,” includes vehicles, adjuvants, or diluents or other auxiliary substances, such as those conventional in the art, which are readily available to the public. For example, pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances include pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, stabilizers, wetting agents and the like. [00184] The term “metabolite,” as used herein, refers to a derivative of the compound which is formed when the compound is metabolized. In one aspect, provided herein are multiglucuronididated, methylated, and sulfated versions of metabolites of NDGA. [00185] The term “active metabolite,” as used herein, refers to a biologically active derivative of the compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized. [00186] The term “metabolized,” as used herein, refers to the sum of the processes (including, but not limited to, hydrolysis reactions and reactions catalyzed by enzymes) by which a particular substance is changed by an organism. Thus, enzymes may produce specific structural alterations to the compound. For example, cytochrome Ρ450 catalyzes a variety of oxidative and reductive reactions while uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferases catalyze the transfer of an activated glucuronic-acid molecule to aromatic alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines and free sulphydryl groups. Further information on metabolism may be obtained from The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th Edition, McGraw-Hill (1996). [00187] The term “unit dosage form,” as used herein, refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human and animal subjects, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of API calculated in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, carrier or vehicle. The specifications for the novel unit dosage forms of the present compounds depend on the particular compound employed and the effect to be achieved, and the pharmacodynamics associated with each compound in the host. [00188] As used herein, “percent,” “percentage” or the symbol “%” means the percent of the component indicated in the composition based on the amount of the carrier present in the composition, on a weight/weight (w/w), weight/volume (w/v) or volume/volume (ν/ν), as indicated with respect to any particular component, all based on the amount of the carrier present in the composition. Thus, different types of carriers may be present in an amount of up to 100% as indicated, which does not preclude the presence of the API, the amount of which may be indicated as a % or as a certain number of mg present in the composition or a certain number of mg/mL present, where the % or mg/mL is based on the amount of the total carrier present in the composition. Certain types of carriers may be present in combination to make up 100% of the carrier. [00189] A “substantially purified” compound in reference to the catecholic butane metabolite that is substantially free of materials that are not the catecholic butane metabolite. By way of example, substantially free is meant at least about 50% free of non-catecholic butane metabolite materials, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90% free or at least about 95% free of non-catecholic butane metabolite materials. [00190] Catecholic butane metabolites can sensitize cancers or other proliferative diseases to conventional therapies as well as re-sensitize cancers or other proliferative diseases after they have acquired resistance to such conventional therapies. The embodiments described herein provide a method of inhibiting both EGFR and IGF-1R in a cell, comprising contacting a cell in which inhibition of both EGFR and IGF-1R is desired with a catecholic butane metabolite as described herein. Because compounds described herein are dual kinase inhibitors, they are useful research tools for in vitro study of the role of EGFR and IGF-1R in biological processes. [00191] Described herein are compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and methods for treating a patient suffering from a proliferative disease by administering an effective amount of a catecholic butane metabolite (ΐ.℮., a single compound that is a dual kinase inhibitor) as described herein, alone or in combination with one or more additional active ingredients (e.g., anticancer agents) and/or treatment regimens (e.g., surgery). [00192] The present application relates generally to methods of treatment of diseases using a catecholic butane metabolite (or a derivative thereof) described herein. By way of example, the application relates to the use of a catecholic butane metabolite having a structure of any one of Formulas IV - FXVII, Formulas FXXII-CXXXV, or a phosphate ester thereof, where the formulas are provided in Tables 1 and 3 (R groups refer to those shown in the formula illustrated in FIG. 29.), in treating a proliferative disease by inhibiting IGF-1R and EGFR. By way of another example, the application relates to the use of a phosphate ester of a catecholic butane metabolite described herein has a structure of any one of Formulas FXVIII - FXXI or Formulas CXXXVI-CXXXVII, wherein the formulas are provided in Tables 2 and 4. R groups refer to those shown in the formula illustrated in FIG. 29.

[00198] In yet another embodiment, the cancer is an endometrial tumor, bladder tumor, multiple myeloma, melanoma, renal tumor, sarcoma, cervical tumor, leukemia, and neuroblastoma. [00199] Tumors as provided herein may be primary tumors or metastases. Cancers may also be epithelial based cancers. In one embodiment, cells of tumors may express EGFR. In another embodiment, cells of tumors may express IGF-1R. In yet another embodiment, cells of tumors may express EGFR and IGF-1R. [00200] Provided herein are methods for treating a malignant, pre-malignant or benign cancer, comprising administering an effective amount of a pharmaceutical compound capable of inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of IGF-1R and EGFR, wherein the pharmaceutical compound is a catecholic butane metabolite (ΐ.℮., a single compound that is a dual kinase inhibitor). [00201] Provided herein are methods of selecting a subject for treatment with a catecholic butane metabolite capable of inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of both IGF-1R and EGF-R, wherein said subject is identified as having levels of IGF-1R, EGFR, or both at baseline levels or at 2Χ greater than baseline levels as compared to control levels. [00202] In one aspect, a subject has been previously treated with an EGFR inhibitor or an IGF-1R inhibitor. [00203] In another aspect, the subject may be resistant to treatment with an EGFR inhibitor alone or an IGF-1R inhibitor alone. [00204] Provided herein are methods for degrading, inhibiting the growth of or killing cancer cells of epithelial origin comprising contacting the cells with an amount of a catecholic butane metabolite effective to degrade, inhibit the growth of or kill cancer cells. [00205] Provided herein are methods of inhibiting tumor size increase, reducing the size of a tumor, reducing tumor proliferation or preventing tumor proliferation in an individual comprising administering to said individual an effective amount of a catecholic butane metabolite described herein to inhibit tumor size increase, reduce the size of a tumor, reduce tumor proliferation or prevent tumor proliferation. Treatment of tumors in some cases includes stasis of symptoms, that is, by treating the patient, the cancer does not worsen and survival of the patient is prolonged. [00206] Patients may be assessed with respect to symptoms at one or more multiple time points including prior to, during, and after treatment regimens. Treatment can result in improving the subject’s condition and can be assessed by determining if one or more of the following events has occurred: decreased tumor size, decreased tumor cell proliferation, decreased numbers of cells, decreased neovascularization and/or increased apoptosis. One or more of these occurrences may, in some cases, result in partial or total elimination of the cancer and prolongation of survival of the patient. Alternatively, for terminal stage cancers, treatment may result in stasis of disease, better quality of life and/or prolongation of survival. Other methods of assessing treatment are known in the art and contemplated herein. [00207] One would understand that classification and staging systems described herein may be used to assess treatment of cancers described herein; additionally, other staging schemes are known in the art and may be used in connection with the methods described herein. By way of example only, the ΤΝΜ classification of malignant tumors may be used as a cancer staging system to describe the extent of cancer in a patient’s body. Τ describes the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, Ν describes regional lymph nodes that are involved, and Μ describes distant metastasis. ΤΝΜ is maintained by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) and is used by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). One would understand that not all tumors have ΤΝΜ classifications such as, for example, brain tumors. Generally, Τ (a,is,(0), 1-4) is measured as the size or direct extent of the primary tumor. Ν (0-3) refers to the degree of spread to regional lymph nodes: NO means that tumor cells are absent from regional lymph nodes, Ν1 means that tumor cells spread to the closest or small numbers of regional lymph nodes, Ν2 means that tumor cells spread to an extent between Ν1 and Ν3; Ν3 means that tumor cells spread to most distant or numerous regional lymph nodes. Μ (0/1) refers to the presence of metastasis: Μ0 means that no distant metastasis are present; Ml means that metastasis has occurred to distant organs (beyond regional lymph nodes). Other parameters may also be assessed. G (1-4) refers to the grade of cancer cells (ΐ.℮., they are low grade if they appear similar to normal cells, and high grade if they appear poorly differentiated). R (0/1/2) refers to the completeness of an operation (ΐ.℮., resection-boundaries free of cancer cells or not). L (0/1) refers to invasion into lymphatic vessels. V (0/1) refers to invasion into vein. C (1-4) refers to a modifier of the certainty (quality) of V. Breast Cancer [00208] In one aspect, provided herein is a method of treating breast cancer, such as a ductal carcinoma in duct tissue in a mammary gland, a breast cancer that is Her2- and/or ER- and/or PR-. [00209] Several types of breast cancer exist that may be treated by the methods described herein. A lobular carcinoma in situ and a ductal carcinoma in situ are breast cancers that have developed in the lobules and ducts, respectively, but have not spread to the fatty tissue surrounding the breast or to other areas of the body. Infiltrating (or invasive) lobular and ductal carcinoma are cancers that have developed in the lobules and ducts, respectively, and have spread to either the breast’s fatty tissue and/or other parts of the body. Other cancers of the breast that would benefit from treatment by the methods are medullary carcinomas, colloid carcinomas, tubular carcinomas, and inflammatory breast cancer. [00210] In one embodiment, breast cancer is staged according to the ΤΝΜ system. Prognosis is closely linked to results of staging, and staging is also used to allocate patients to treatments both in clinical trials and clinical practice. [00211] Briefly, the information for staging is as follows: [00212] ΤΧ: Primary tumor cannot be assessed. TO: No evidence of tumor. Tis: Carcinoma in situ, no invasion; Τ1: Tumor is 2 cm or less; Τ2: Tumor is more than 2 cm but not more than 5 cm; Τ3: Tumor is more than 5 cm; Τ4: Tumor of any size growing into the chest wall or skin, or inflammatory breast cancer [00213] NX: Nearby lymph nodes cannot be assessed NO: cancer has not spread to regional lymph nodes. Ν1: cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary or one internal mammary lymph node Ν2: cancer has spread to 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes or multiple internal mammary lymph nodes Ν3: One of the following applies: cancer has spread to 10 or more axillary lymph nodes, or cancer has spread to the lymph nodes under the clavicle (collar bone), or cancer has spread to the lymph nodes above the clavicle, or cancer involves axillary lymph nodes and has enlarged the internal mammary lymph nodes, or cancer involves 4 or more axillary lymph nodes, and tiny amounts of cancer are found in internal mammary lymph nodes on sentinel lymph node biopsy. [00214] MX: presence of distant spread (metastasis) cannot be assessed. Μ0: no distant spread. Ml: spread to distant organs (not including the supraclavicular lymph node) has occurred. [00215] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for breast cancer patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Ovarian cancer [00216] In another aspect, provided herein is a method of treating ovarian cancer, including epithelial ovarian tumors. Preferably, the method treats an ovarian cancer selected from the following: an adenocarcinoma in the ovary and an adenocarcinoma that has migrated from the ovary into the abdominal cavity. [00217] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for ovarian cancer patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Cervical Cancer [00218] In another aspect, the method treats cervical cancer, preferably an adenocarcinoma in the cervix epithelial. Two main types of this cancer exist: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinomas. The former constitutes about 80-90% of all cervical cancers and develops where the ectocervix (portion closest to the vagina) and the endocervix (portion closest to the uterus) join. The latter develop in the mucous-producing gland cells of the endocervix. Some cervical cancers have characteristics of both of these and are called adenosquamous carcinomas or mixed carcinomas. [00219] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for cervical cancer patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Prostate Cancer [00220] In one other aspect, provided herein is a method to treat prostate cancer, preferably a prostate cancer selected from the following: an adenocarcinoma or an adenocarinoma that has migrated to the bone. Prostate cancer develops in the prostate organ in men, which surrounds the first part of the urethra. The prostate has several cell types but 99% of tumors are adenocarcinomas that develop in the glandular cells responsible for generating seminal fluid. [00221] There are two schemes commonly used to stage prostate cancer. The most common is the ΤΝΜ system, which evaluates the size of the tumor, the extent of involved lymph nodes, and any metastasis (distant spread). As with many other cancers, these are often grouped into four stages (I-IV). Another scheme, used less commonly, is the Whitmore-Jewett stage. [00222] Briefly, Stage I disease is cancer that is found incidentally in a small part of the sample when prostate tissue was removed for other reasons, such as benign prostatic hypertrophy, and the cells closely resemble normal cells and the gland feels normal to the examining finger. In Stage II more of the prostate is involved and a lump can be felt within the gland. In Stage III, the tumor has spread through the prostatic capsule and the lump can be felt on the surface of the gland. In Stage IV disease, the tumor has invaded nearby structures, or has spread to lymph nodes or other organs. Grading is based on cellular content and tissue architecture from biopsies (Gleason) which provides an estimate of the destructive potential and ultimate prognosis of the disease. [00223] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for prostate cancer patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a cat catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Pancreatic Cancer [00224] In another aspect, provided herein is a method of treating pancreatic cancer, preferably a pancreatic cancer selected from the following: an epitheliod carcinoma in the pancreatic duct tissue and an adenocarcinoma in a pancreatic duct. The most common type of pancreatic cancer is an adenocarcinoma, which occurs in the lining of the pancreatic duct. [00225] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for pancreatic cancer patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Bladder Cancer [00226] In another aspect, provided herein is a method of treating bladder cancer, preferably a transitional cell carcinoma in urinary bladder. Bladder cancers are urothelial carcinomas (transitional cell carcinomas) or tumors in the urothelial cells that line the bladder. The remaining cases of bladder cancer are squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and small cell cancers. Several subtypes of urothelial carcinomas exist depending on whether they are noninvasive or invasive and whether they are papillary, or flat. Noninvasive tumors are in the urothelium, the innermost layer of the bladder, while invasive tumors have spread from the urothelium to deeper layers of the bladder’s main muscle wall. Invasive papillary urothelial carcinomas are slender finger-like projections that branch into the hollow center of the bladder and also grow outward into the bladder wall. Non-invasive papillary urothelial tumors grow towards the center of the bladder. While a non-invasive, flat urothelial tumor (also called a flat carcinoma in situ) is confined to the layer of cells closest to the inside hollow part of the bladder, an invasive flat urothelial carcinoma invades the deeper layer of the bladder, particularly the muscle layer. [00227] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for bladder cancer patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Acute Myeloid Leukemia [00228] In another aspect, provided herein is a method of treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML), preferably acute promyleocytic leukemia in peripheral blood. AML begins in the bone marrow but can spread to other parts of the body including the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, central nervous system, and testes. It is acute meaning it develops quickly and may be fatal if not treated within a few months. AML is characterized by immature bone marrow cells usually granulocytes or monocytes, which continue to reproduce and accumulate. [00229] There are other types of leukemia’s that can also be treated by the methods provided herein including but not limited to, Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Hairy Cell Leukemia, Myelodysplasia, and Myeloproliferative Disorders. [00230] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for leukemia patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Lung Cancer [00231] In another aspect, provided herein is a method to treat lung cancer. The most common type of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers and is divided into squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, and large cell undifferentiated carcinomas. Small cell lung cancer accounts for 15-20% of lung cancers. [00232] Lung cancer staging is an assessment of the degree of spread of the cancer from its original source. It is an important factor affecting the prognosis and potential treatment of lung cancer. Non-small cell lung carcinoma is staged from IA (“one A”; best prognosis) to IV (“four” worst prognosis). Small cell lung carcinoma is classified as limited stage if it is confined to one half of the chest and within the scope of a single radiotherapy field; otherwise, it is extensive stage. [00233] Lung cancer may be staged using EUS (endoscopic ultrasound) or ΤΝΜ. Staging a part of the assessment of patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma. These patients undergo staging as part of the process of considering prognosis and treatment. The AJCC recommends ΤΝΜ staging followed by further grouping. [00234] Primary tumor (Τ): [00235] ΤΧ: The primary tumor cannot be assessed, or there are malignant cells in the sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage but not seen on imaging or bronchoscopy; [00236] Tis: Carcinoma in situ. [00237] TO: No evidence of primary tumor. [00238] Τ1: Tumor less than 3 cm in its greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura and without bronchoscopic invasion into the main bronchus. [00239] Τ2: A tumor with any of: more than 3 cm in greatest dimension; extending into the main bronchus (but more than 2 cm distal to the carina), and obstructive pneumonitis (but not involving the entire lung). [00240] Τ3: A tumor with any of: invasion of the chest wall, diaphragm, mediastinal pleura, or parietal pericardium; extending into the main bronchus, within 2 cm of the carina, but not involving the carina; and obstructive pneumonitis of the entire lung. [00241] Τ4: A tumor with any of: invasion of the mediastinum, heart, great vessels, trachea, esophagus, vertebra, or carina; separate tumor nodules in the same lobe; and malignant pleural effusion. [00242] Lymph nodes (Ν): NX: Lymph nodes cannot be assessed; NO: No lymph nodes involved; Ν1: Metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes; Ν2: Metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal lymph nodes; and Ν3: Metastasis to any of: ipsilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes; ipsilateral scalene lymph nodes; and contralateral lymph nodes. [00243] Distant metastasis (Μ): MX: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed; Μ0: No distant metastasis; and Ml: Distant metastasis is present. [00244] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for lung cancer patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Skin Cancer [00245] In another aspect, provided herein is a method to treat skin cancer. There are several types of cancer that start in the skin. The most common types are basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which are non-melanoma skin cancers. Actinic keratosis is a skin condition that sometimes develops into squamous cell carcinoma. Non-melanoma skin cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body. Melanoma, the rarest form of skin cancer, is more likely to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. [00246] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for skin cancer patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Eye Cancer, Retinoblastoma [00247] In another aspect, provided herein is a method to treat eye retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor of the retina. Although retinoblastoma may occur at any age, it most often occurs in younger children, usually before the age of 5 years. The tumor may be in one eye only or in both eyes. Retinoblastoma is usually confined to the eye and does not spread to nearby tissue or other parts of the body. [00248] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for eye retinoblastoma patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Eye Cancer, Intraocular Melanoma [00249] In another aspect, provided herein is a method to treat intraocular (eye) melanoma. Intraocular melanoma, a rare cancer, is a disease in which cancer cells are found in the part of the eye called the uvea. The uvea includes the iris, the ciliary body, and the choroid. Intraocular melanoma occurs most often in people who are middle aged. [00250] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for intraocular melanoma patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Endometrium Cancer [00251] In another aspect, provided herein is a method to treat endometrium cancer. Endometrial cancer is a cancer that starts in the endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus. Some of the examples of the cancer of uterus and endometrium include, but are not limited to, adenocarcinomas, adenoacanthomas, adenosquamous carcinomas, papillary serous adenocarcinomas, clear cell adenocarcinomas, uterine sarcomas, stromal sarcomas, malignant mixed mesodermal tumors, and leiomyosarcomas. [00252] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for endometrium cancer patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Liver Cancer [00253] In another aspect, provided herein is a method to treat primary liver cancer (cancer that begins in the liver). Primary liver cancer can occur in both adults and children. [00254] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for liver cancer patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Kidney Cancer [00255] In another aspect, provided herein is a method to treat kidney cancer. Kidney cancer (also called renal cell cancer or renal adenocarcinoma) is a disease in which malignant cells are found in the lining of tubules in the kidney. [00256] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for kidney cancer patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Thyroid Cancer [00257] In another aspect, provided herein is a method to treat thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer is a disease in which cancer (malignant) cells are found in the tissues of the thyroid gland. The four main types of thyroid cancer are papillary, follicular, medullary and anaplastic. [00258] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for thyroid cancer patients, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. AIDS Related Cancers [00259] Provided herein are methods to treat AIDS-related cancers including, but not limited to AIDS-related lymphoma and Kaposi’s Sarcoma. The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for AIDS-related cancers, by administration of a catecholic butane or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. AIDS-Related Lymphoma [00260] In another aspect, provided herein is a method to treat AIDS-related lymphoma. AIDS-related lymphoma is a disease in which malignant cells form in the lymph system of patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which attacks and weakens the body's immune system. The immune system is then unable to fight infection and diseases that invade the body. People with HIV disease have an increased risk of developing infections, lymphoma, and other types of cancer. Lymphomas are cancers that affect the white blood cells of the lymph system. Lymphomas are divided into two general types: Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Both Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma may occur in AIDS patients, but non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is more common. When a person with AIDS has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, it is called an AIDS-related lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas may be indolent (slow-growing) or aggressive (fast-growing). AIDS-related lymphoma is usually aggressive. The three main types of AIDS-related lymphoma are diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, B-cell immunoblastic lymphoma and small non-cleaved cell lymphoma. [00261] Treatment of AIDS-related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS. Patients with AIDS have weakened immune systems and treatment can cause further damage. For this reason, patients who have AIDS-related lymphoma are usually treated with lower doses of drugs than lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS. Highlyactive antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is used to slow progression of HIV. Medicine to prevent and treat infections, which can be serious, is also used. Kaposi's Sarcoma [00262] In another aspect, provided herein is a method to treat Kaposi’s sarcoma. Kaposi’s sarcoma is a disease in which cancer cells are found in the tissues under the skin or mucous membranes that line the mouth, nose, and anus. Classic Kaposi’s sarcoma usually occurs in older men of Jewish, Italian, or Mediterranean heritage. This type of Kaposi’s sarcoma progresses slowly, sometimes over 10 to 15 years. Kaposi’s sarcoma may occur in people who are taking immunosuppressants. Kaposi’s sarcoma in patients who have Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is called epidemic Kaposi’s sarcoma. Kaposi’s sarcoma in people with AIDS usually spreads more quickly than other kinds of Kaposi’s sarcoma and often is found in many parts of the body. [00263] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for Kaposi’s sarcoma, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Viral-Induced Cancers [00264] In another aspect, provided herein is a method to treat viral-induced cancers. Several common viruses are clearly or probable causal factors in the etiology of specific malignancies. These viruses either normally establish latency or few can become persistent infections. Oncogenesis is probably linked to an enhanced level of viral activation in the infected host, reflecting heavy viral dose or compromised immune control. The major virus-malignancy systems include hepatitis Β virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatocellular carcinoma; human lymphotropic virus-type 1 (HTLV-1) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma; and human papilloma virus (HPV) and cervical cancer. In general, these malignancies occur relatively early in life, typically peaking in middle-age or earlier. Virus-Induced Hepatocellular Carcinoma [00265] The causal relationship between both HBV and HCV and hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer is established through substantial epidemiologic evidence. Both appear to act via chronic replication in the liver by causing cell death and subsequent regeneration. Viral-Induced Adult Τ cell leukemia/lymphoma [00266] The association between HTLV-1 and Adult Τ cell leukemia (ATL) is firmly established. Unlike the other oncogenic viruses found throughout the world, HTLV-1 is highly geographically restricted, being found primarily in southern Japan, the Caribbean, west and central Africa, and the South Pacific islands. Evidence for causality includes the monoclonal integration of viral genome in almost all cases of ATL in carriers. The risk factors for HTLV-1 associated malignancy appear to be perinatal infection, high viral load, and being male sex. Adult Τ cell leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Viral-Induced Cervical Cancer [00267] Infection of the cervix with human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common cause of cervical cancer. Not all women with HPV infection, however, will develop cervical cancer. Cervical cancer usually develops slowly over time. Before cancer appears in the cervix, the cells of the cervix go through changes known as dysplasia, in which cells that are not normal begin to appear in the cervical tissue. Later, cancer cells start to grow and spread more deeply into the cervix and to surrounding areas. . [00268] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for virally induced cancers, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Central Nervous System (CNS) Cancers [00269] Brain and spinal cord tumors are abnormal growths of tissue found inside the skull or the bony spinal column, which are the primary components of the central nervous system (CNS). Benign tumors are non-cancerous, and malignant tumors are cancerous. The CNS is housed within rigid, bony quarters (ΐ.℮., the skull and spinal column), so any abnormal growth, whether benign or malignant, can place pressure on sensitive tissues and impair function. Tumors that originate in the brain or spinal cord are called primary tumors. Most primary tumors are caused by out-of-control growth among cells that surround and support neurons. In a small number of individuals, primary tumors may result from specific genetic disease (e.g., neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis) or from exposure to radiation or cancer-causing chemicals. The cause of most primary tumors remains a mystery. [00270] The first test to diagnose brain and spinal column tumors is a neurological examination. Special imaging techniques (computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography) are also employed. Laboratory tests include the EEG and the spinal tap. A biopsy, a surgical procedure in which a sample of tissue is taken from a suspected tumor, helps doctors diagnose the type of tumor. [00271] Tumors are classified according to the kind of cell from which the tumor seems to originate. The most common primary brain tumor in adults comes from cells in the brain called astrocytes that make up the blood-brain barrier and contribute to the nutrition of the central nervous system. These tumors are called gliomas (astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, or glioblastoma multiforme) and account for 65% of all primary central nervous system tumors. Some of the tumors are, but not limited to, Oligodendroglioma, Ependymoma, Meningioma, Lymphoma, Schwannoma, and Medulloblastoma. Neuroepithelial Tumors of the CNS [00272] Astrocytic tumors, such as astrocytoma,; anaplastic (malignant) astrocytoma, such as hemispheric, diencephalic, optic, brain stem, cerebellar; glioblastoma multiforme; pilocytic astrocytoma, such as hemispheric, diencephalic, optic, brain stem, cerebellar; subependymal giant cell astrocytoma; and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. Oligodendroglial tumors, such as oligodendroglioma; and anaplastic (malignant) oligodendroglioma. Ependymal cell tumors, such as ependymoma,; anaplastic ependymoma; myxopapillary ependymoma; and subependymoma. Mixed gliomas, such as mixed oligoastrocytoma; anaplastic (malignant) oligoastrocytoma; and others (e.g. ependymo-astrocytomas). Neuroepithelial tumors of uncertain origin, such as polar spongioblastoma; astroblastoma; and gliomatosis cerebri. Tumors of the choroid plexus, such as choroid plexus papilloma; and choroid plexus carcinoma (anaplastic choroid plexus papilloma). Neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial tumors, such as gangliocytoma; dysplastic gangliocytoma of cerebellum (Lhermitte-Duclos); ganglioglioma; anaplastic (malignant) ganglioglioma; desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma, such as desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma; central neurocytoma; dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor; olfactory neuroblastoma (esthesioneuroblastoma. Pineal Parenchyma Tumors, such as pineocytoma; pineoblastoma; and mixed pineocytoma/pineoblastoma. Tumors with neuroblastic or glioblastic elements (embryonal tumors), such as medulloepithelioma; primitive neuroectodermal tumors with multipotent differentiation, such as medulloblastoma; cerebral primitive neuroectodermal tumor; neuroblastoma; retinoblastoma; and ependymoblastoma. Other CNS Neoplasms [00273] Tumors of the Sellar Region, such as pituitary adenoma; pituitary carcinoma; and craniopharyngioma. Hematopoietic tumors, such as primary malignant lymphomas; plasmacytoma; and granulocytic sarcoma. Germ Cell Tumors, such as germinoma; embryonal carcinoma; yolk sac tumor (endodermal sinus tumor); choriocarcinoma; teratoma; and mixed germ cell tumors. Tumors of the Meninges, such as meningioma; atypical meningioma; and anaplastic (malignant) meningioma. Non-menigothelial tumors of the meninges, such as Benign Mesenchymal; Malignant Mesenchymal; Primary Melanocytic Lesions; Hemopoietic Neoplasms; and Tumors of Uncertain Histogenesis, such as hemangioblastoma (capillary hemangioblastoma). Tumors of Cranial and Spinal Nerves, such as schwannoma (neurinoma, neurilemoma); neurofibroma; malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (malignant schwannoma), such as epithelioid, divergent mesenchymal or epithelial differentiation, and melanotic. Local Extensions from Regional Tumors; such as paraganglioma (chemodectoma); chordoma; chodroma; chondrosarcoma; and carcinoma. Metastatic tumors, Unclassified Tumors and Cysts and Tumor-like Lesions, such as Rathke cleft cyst; Epidermoid; dermoid; colloid cyst of the third ventricle; enterogenous cyst; neuroglial cyst; granular cell tumor (choristoma, pituicytoma); hypothalamic neuronal hamartoma; nasal glial herterotopia; and plasma cell granuloma. [00274] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for CNS neoplasms, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) Cancers [00275] The peripheral nervous system consists of the nerves that branch out from the brain and spinal cord. These nerves form the communication network between the CNS and the body parts. The peripheral nervous system is further subdivided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The somatic nervous system consists of nerves that go to the skin and muscles and is involved in conscious activities. The autonomic nervous system consists of nerves that connect the CNS to the visceral organs such as the heart, stomach, and intestines. It mediates unconscious activities. [00276] Acoustic neuromas are benign fibrous growths that arise from the balance nerve, also called the eighth cranial nerve or vestibulocochlear nerve. These tumors are non-malignant, meaning that they do not spread or metastasize to other parts of the body. The location of these tumors is deep inside the skull, adjacent to vital brain centers in the brain stem. As the tumors enlarge, they involve surrounding structures which have to do with vital functions. In the majority of cases, these tumors grow slowly over a period of years. [00277] The malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is the malignant counterpart to benign soft tissue tumors such as neurofibromas and schwannomas. It is most common in the deep soft tissue, usually in close proximity of a nerve trunk. The most common sites include the sciatic nerve, brachial plexus, and sarcal plexus. The most common symptom is pain which usually prompts a biopsy. It is a rare, aggressive, and lethal orbital neoplasm that usually arises from sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve in adults. Malignant PNS tumor spreads along nerves to involve the brain, and most patients die within 5 years of clinical diagnosis. The MPNST may be classified into three major categories with epithelioid, mesenchymal or glandular characteristics. Some of the MPNST include but not limited to, Subcutaneous malignant epithelioid schwannoma with cartilaginous differentiation, Glandular malignant schwannoma, Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor with perineurial differentiation, Cutaneous epithelioid malignant nerve sheath tumor with rhabdoid features, Superficial epithelioid MPNST, Triton Tumor (MPNST with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation), Schwannoma with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation. Rare MPNST cases contain multiple sarcomatous tissue types, especially osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma and angiosarcoma. These have sometimes been indistinguishable from the malignant mesenchymoma of soft tissue. [00278] Other types of PNS cancers include but not limited to, malignant fibrous cytoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant meningioma, malignant mesothelioma, and malignant mixed Mullerian tumor. [00279] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for PNS cancers, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Oral Cavity and Oropharyngeal Cancer [00280] Management of patients with central nervous system (CNS) cancers remains a formidable task. Cancers such as, hypopharyngeal cancer, laryngeal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, may be treated using the compounds described herein. [00281] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments Stomach Cancer [00282] Stomach cancer is the result of cell changes in the lining of the stomach. There are three main types of stomach cancers: lymphomas, gastric stromal tumors, and carcinoid tumors. Lymphomas are cancers of the immune system tissue that are sometimes found in the wall of the stomach. Gastric stromal tumors develop from the tissue of the stomach wall. Carcinoid tumors are tumors of hormone-producing cells of the stomach. The causes of stomach cancer continue to be debated. A combination of heredity and environment (diet, smoking, etc) are all thought to play a part. [00283] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for stomach cancer, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Testicular cancer [00284] Testicular cancer is cancer that typically develops in one or both testicles in young men. Cancers of the testicle develop in certain cells known as germ cells. The 2 main types of germ cell tumors (GCTs) that occur in men are seminomas (60%) and nonseminomas (40%). Tumors can also arise in the supportive and hormone-producing tissues, or stroma, of the testicles. Such tumors are known as gonadal stromal tumors. The 2 main types are Leydig cell tumors and Sertoli cell tumors. Secondary testicular tumors are those that start in another organ and then spread to the testicle. Lymphoma is the most common secondary testicular cancer. [00285] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for testicular cancer, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Thymus Cancer [00286] The thymus is a small organ located in the upper/front portion of your chest, extending from the base of the throat to the front of the heart. The thymus contains 2 main types of cells, thymic epithelial cells and lymphocytes. Thymic epithelial cells can give origin to thymomas and thymic carcinomas. Lymphocytes, whether in the thymus or in the lymph nodes, can become malignant and develop into cancers called Hodgkin disease and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The thymus also contains another much less common type of cells called Kulchitsky cells, or neuroendocrine cells, which normally release certain hormones. These cells can give rise to cancers, called carcinoids or carcinoid tumors that often release the same type of hormones, and are similar to other tumors arising from neuroendocrine cells elsewhere in the body. [00287] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for thymus cancer, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. [00288] Provided herein are methods for treating a disorder of the skin, comprising administering an effective amount of a pharmaceutical compound capable of inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of IGF-1R and EGFR, wherein the pharmaceutical compound is a catecholic butane metabolite. [00289] In one aspect, the disorder of the skin is for example, a tumor, actinic keratosis, acne, psoriasis, skin wounds, warts, bacterial infections, fungal infections or viral infections. Viral infections include, but are not limited to, an HIV infection, an HPV infection and an HSV infection. Tumors include, but are not limited to, basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, melanomas, Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, Merkel cell carcinoma and Kaposi’s sarcoma. Colon Cancer and Colorectal Cancer [00290] Colorectal cancer, also called colon cancer or large bowel cancer, includes cancerous growths in the colon, rectum and appendix. With 655,000 deaths worldwide per year, it is the third most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the Western world. Many colorectal cancers are thought to arise from adenomatous polyps in the colon. These mushroom-like growths are usually benign, but some may develop into cancer over time. [00291] In another embodiment, Dukes classification may be used to classify colorectal cancer based on stages A-D. Stage A refers to colorectal cancer that is limited to mucosa (ΐ.℮., has not invaded through the bowel wall). Stage Β1 refers to extending into muscularis propria, but not penetrating through it (ΐ.℮., lymph nodes have not been invaded); whereas Stage Β2 cancer has penetrated through the muscularis propria, but not penetrating through it (ΐ.℮., lymph nodes have not been invaded). Stage Cl refers to cancer that extends into the muscularis propria, but not penetrating through it (ΐ.℮., lymph nodes are involved); whereas Stage C2 refers to cancer that extends into the muscularis propria and penetrating through it (ΐ.℮., lymph nodes are involved). Stage D refers to distant metastatic spread. The ΤΝΜ system may also be used to stage colorectal cancer according to conventional means known in the art. [00292] The methods provided herein may provide a beneficial effect for colorectal cancer, by administration of a catecholic butane metabolite or a combination of administration of a catecholic butane metabolite and one or more anticancer treatments. Inflammatory diseases [00293] A composition described herein may also be used for treatment of an inflammatory disease, such as various types of arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. [00294] Inflammatory diseases are intended to include all diseases in which leukotrienes are known to play a major role or have been implicated. Non-limiting examples of inflammatory diseases that may be treated effectively by a compound described herein include, but are not limited to, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriasis, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosis, Stills disease, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and inflammatory bowel diseases (such as ulcerative colitis and Crohns), asthma, allergic rhinitis, inflammatory pain, adult respiratory distress syndrome, glomerulonephritis, inflammation of the skin, and virally induced inflammation (caused by CMV and other members of the Herpesviridae) leading to atherosclerosis/arteriosclerosis and subsequent coronary artery disease, among others. Dosing [00295] A physician or veterinarian can readily determine and prescribe the “effective amount” (ED50) of a composition required to inhibit both EGFR and IGF-1R. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds employed in the composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. [00296] A “therapeutically effective amount” as used herein, is an amount that achieves at least partially a desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect in an organ or tissue. In one example, the amount of an inhibitor to bring about prevention and/or therapeutic treatment of the disease is not fixed per se. The amount of an inhibitor administered will vary with the type of disease, extent of the disease, and size of species of the mammal suffering from the disease. [00297] One embodiment contemplates the use of the compositions described herein to make a medicament for treating a condition, disease or disorder described herein. Medicaments can be formulated based on the physical characteristics of the patient/subject needing treatment, and can be formulated in single or multiple formulations based on the stage of the condition, disease or disorder. Medicaments can be packaged in a suitable package with appropriate labels for the distribution to hospitals and clinics wherein the label is for the indication of treating a subject having a disease described herein. Medicaments can be packaged as a single or multiple units. Instructions for the dosage and administration of the compositions can be included with the packages as described elsewhere herein.

Alternatively, catecholic butane metabolites may be administered a flat dose of a catecholic butane metabolite in an amount of from about 1,500 mg per day to about 2,500 mg per day; from about 1,800 mg per day to about 2,300 mg per day; or about 2,000 mg per day. In one embodiment, a catecholic butane metabolite may be contacted with target cells in a concentration in a range of about 1 μΜ to about 30 μΜ. In another embodiment, a catecholic butane metabolite may be contacted with target cells in a concentration in a range of about 1 μΜ to about 10 μΜ. [00300] In another embodiment, NDGA may be administered in different dosing and administration schedules such as, for example: (1) twice-daily oral administration on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity; (2) 2000 mg once-daily oral administration; (3) IV on days 1-5, treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity; (4) dose escalation with starting schedule to a target of 20 mg/cm3 tumor volume and then, new patient cohorts will have their schedule extended to weekly administration for 4 weeks. Dose escalation will continue, assuming tolerability, so that cohorts will be treated for 6 weeks, and finally, 8 weeks; (5) IV weekly over 24 hours, dose will commence with 100 mg/hour (2400 mg in a 24-hour period) with escalation in 5 cohorts of 3 to 6 patients with increments of 25 mg per hour to a maximum of 200 mg/hr (4800 mg in a 24-hour period) or until MTD is defined; (6) topical application to the cervix; and (7) dose escalation with IV infusion for 5 consecutive days every 28 days. [00301] In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition may be administered more frequently than once every 6 days for a period of time, or more frequently than once every 2 days for a period of time. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition is administered daily for four weeks. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition is administered three times daily for three weeks with a one week hiatus prior to starting a new cycle. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition is administered daily for one week followed by a one week hiatus. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition is administered daily for two weeks followed by a two week hiatus. In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition is administered one time or two times daily continuously or with a one week hiatus prior to starting a new cycle. In yet another embodiment, a pharmaceutical composition is administered one time per week or two times per week. One would understand that, as needed, where cycles of treatment are considered, a patient may be assessed and the treatment repeated as needed. [00302] In various embodiments, a catecholic butane metabolite may be prepared as a free base or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof. Also described, are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a catecholic butane metabolite or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, polymorph, ester, tautomer or prodrug thereof. The compounds and compositions described herein may be administered either alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents, in a pharmaceutical composition, according to standard pharmaceutical practice. [00303] In addition to the aforementioned examples and embodiments of dosages, cycles, and schedules of cycles, numerous permutations of the aforementioned dosages, cycles, and schedules of cycles for the co-administration of a compound with a second chemotherapeutic compound, radiotherapy, or surgery are contemplated herein and can be administered according to the patient, type of cancer, and/or appropriate treatment schedule as determined by qualified medical professionals. [00304] In various embodiments, a therapeutically equivalent amount of a catecholic butane metabolite dose described herein is used. [00305] In various embodiments, the catecholic butane metabolite is dosed in so as to minimize toxicity to the patient. In some embodiments, the catecholic butane metabolite is dosed in a manner adapted to provide particular pharmacokinetic (ΡΚ) parameters in a human patient. In some embodiments, the catecholic butane metabolite is dosed in a manner adapted to provide a particular maximum blood concentration (Cmax) of the catecholic butane metabolite. In some embodiments, the catecholic butane metabolite is dosed in a manner adapted to provide a particular time (Tmax) at which a maximum blood concentration of the catecholic butane metabolite is obtained. In some embodiments, the catecholic butane metabolite is dosed in a manner adapted to provide a particular area under the blood plasma concentration curve (AUC) for the catecholic butane metabolite. In some embodiments, the catecholic butane metabolite is dosed in a manner to provide a particular clearance rate (CL/F) or a particular half-life (Τ 1/2) for the catecholic butane metabolite. Unless otherwise specified herein, the ΡΚ parameters recited herein, including in the appended claims, refer to mean ΡΚ values for a cohort of at least 3 patients under the same dosing schedule. Thus, unless otherwise specified: AUC = mean AUC for a cohort of at least 3 patients; Cmax = mean Cmax for a cohort of at least 3 patients; Tmax = mean Tmax for a cohort of at least 3 patients; Τ m = mean Τ m for a cohort of at least 3 patients; and CL/F = mean CL/F for a cohort of at least 3 patients. In some embodiments, the mean is a cohort of at least 6 patients, or at least 12 patients or at least 24 patients or at least 36 patients. Where other than mean ΡΚ values are intended, it will be indicated that the value pertains to individuals only. Also, unless otherwise indicated herein, AUC refers to the mean AUC for the cohort of at least 3 patients, extrapolated to infinity following a standard clearance model. If AUC for a time certain is intended, the start (χ) and end (y) times will be indicated by suffix appellation to “AUC” (e.g., AUCX, y ). In one embodiment, the solubility of NDGA is about 8 pg/mL in intestinal fluids. [00306] In one embodiment of the methods described herein, a patient exhibits an improvement in one or more symptoms of said proliferative disease or inflammatory disease of at least about a 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 20-fold, 25-fold, 30-fold, 35-fold, 40-fold, 45-fold, 50-fold or greater amount following administration of a metabolite of NDGA than a patient not receiving administration of a metabolite of NDGA. [00307] In another embodiment of the methods described herein, a patient exhibits an improvement in one or more symptoms of said proliferative disease or inflammatory disease of at least about a 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 15-fold, 20-fold, 25-fold, 30-fold, 3 5-fold, 40-fold, 45-fold, 50-fold or greater amount following administration of a metabolite of NDGA than a patient administered a placebo. [00308] In one embodiment of the methods described herein, a patient exhibits an improvement in one or more symptoms of said proliferative disease or inflammatory disease of about 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50% or greater amount following administration of a metabolite of NDGA than a patient not receiving administration of a metabolite of NDGA. [00309] In another embodiment of the methods described herein, a patient exhibits an improvement in one or more symptoms of said proliferative disease or inflammatory disease of at least about a 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50% or greater amount following administration of a metabolite of NDGA than a patient administered a placebo. Assessment and Diagnostics [00310] Provided herein is a method of selecting a subject for treatment with a catecholic butane, comprising: (a) measuring the concentration of a catecholic butane metabolite in a sample obtained from said subject; and (b) administering to said subject a catecholic butane for treatment of a disease or disorder only if the concentration of the catecholic butane metabolite of (a) is above at least about 0.5 pg/mL. [00311] Provided herein is a method of selecting a subject for treatment with a compound described herein, comprising: (a) measuring the concentration of a catecholic butane metabolite in a sample obtained from said subject; and (b) administering to said subject a catecholic butane metabolite, and/or a phosphate ester thereof, if the concentration of the catecholic butane metabolite of (a) is less than about 0.5 pg/mL. [00312] In one embodiment, the sample to be tested is any fluid that may be extracted from a patient including, but not limited to, blood, plasma, serum, sputum, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, sweat, urine, tears, and tissue extract, including tumor tissue, cell extract, tissue and organ extract. [00313] Measuring may comprise any method by which one or more metabolites in the sample may be quantitatively or semi-quantitatively measured. In one embodiment, measuring comprises mass spectroscopy (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high phase liquid chromatography (HPLC), infrared (IR) UV/Vis spectroscopy, HPLC-MS, ELISA or any antibody-based assay. [00314] Samples may be obtained from a patient one or more times prior to commencement of treatment, during one or more time points during treatment, or one or more times after treatment is stopped. Patients may be monitored for effectiveness of treatment using any of the methods described herein or in the examples below. [00315] In one non-limiting example of such methods, measuring comprises: semi-quantitatively measuring the levels of one or more metabolites comprising mass spectrometry with high resolution accurate mass measurements; wherein said method comprises a pre-scan, an FT analyzer to perform a slow survey scan at high resolution (HRMS) and, in parallel, a LTQ ion trip to acquire MS(n) data using a data-dependent acquisition (DDA) event. The DDA comprises a decision event and two MS2 product ion scans to select the two most intense ions detected in the pre-scan which are on the parent mass list. Data may be processed using Metworks™ software (ν 1.3.0, Thermo) and data is processed using two steps: (1) subtraction of the chromatogram of a control sample (solvent control in blank matrix) from the analyzed sample, leading to creation of a “SUB” file. This file contains peaks of components unique to the analyzed sample and peaks of components with intensities in the analyzed sample at least two times higher (S/N ratio) than in the control sample. (2) A search for major unique peaks present in “SUB” (“chro” search) is conducted for comprehensive metabolite detection and, finally, the “SUB” file and the results of automatic detection are evaluated. [00316] Following assessment of a subject using such methods, a subject may be administered one or more catecholic butane metabolites described herein or may be administered a one or more various anti-neoplastic chemotherapeutic agents, chemopreventative agents, side-effect limiting agents, and/or anti-neoplastic treatments (e.g., surgery) as described in more detail below. Combination Therapy [00317] One aspect of the embodiments described herein provides methods for treating cancer using different combinations of treatment regimens. For example, such catecholic butane metabolite compounds in conjunction with one or more various anti-neoplastic chemotherapeutic agents, chemopreventative agents, side-effect limiting agents, and/or anti-neoplastic treatments (e.g., surgery). [00318] In any of such methods provided herein, a subject may be further administered one or more additional anti cancer agents. As described above, these additional cancer therapies can be, for example, surgery, radiation therapy, administration of chemotherapeutic agents and combinations of any two or all of these methods. Combination treatments may occur sequentially or concurrently and the combination therapies may be neoadjuvant therapies or adjuvant therapies. Anti-cancer agents include, but are not limited to, DNA damaging agents, topoisomerase inhibitors and mitotic inhibitors. Many chemotherapeutics are presently known in the art and can be used in combination with the compounds described herein. In some embodiments, the chemotherapeutic is selected from the group consisting of mitotic inhibitors, alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, intercalating antibiotics, growth factor inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors, enzymes, topoisomerase inhibitors, biological response modifiers, anti-hormones, angiogenesis inhibitors, and anti-androgens. [00319] In one embodiment, the subject to be treated may be resistant to treatment with an EGFR inhibitor alone, an IGF-1R inhibitor alone, or an EGFR inhibitor and an IGF-1R inhibitor. [00320] As used herein, the terms “cancer treatment,” “cancer therapy” and the like encompasses treatments such as surgery such as cutting, abrading, ablating (by physical or chemical means, or a combination of physical or chemical means), suturing, lasering or otherwise physically changing body tissues and organs), radiation therapy, administration of chemotherapeutic agents and combinations of any two or all of these methods. Combination treatments may occur sequentially or concurrently. Treatments, such as radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, that are administered prior to surgery, are referred to as neoadjuvant therapy. Treatments, such as radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, administered after surgery is referred to herein as adjuvant therapy. Examples of surgeries that may be used for cancer treatment include, but are not limited to radical prostatectomy, cryotherapy, mastectomy, lumpectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate, and the like. [00321] Many chemotherapeutic agents are known and operate via a wide variety of modes of action. In some non-limiting embodiments, the chemotherapeutic agent is a cytotoxic agent, an anti-proliferative, a targeting agent (such as kinase inhibitors and cell cycle regulators), a protease inhibitor, or a biologic agent (such as cytokines, vaccines, viral agents, and other immunostimulants such as BCG, hormones, monoclonal antibodies and siRNA). The nature of a combination therapy involving administration of a chemotherapeutic agent will depend upon the type of agent being used. [00322] Where combination treatments are contemplated, it is not intended that an inhibitor be limited by the particular nature of the combination. For example, an inhibitor may be administered in combination as simple mixtures as well as chemical hybrids. An example of the latter is where the compound is covalently linked to a targeting carrier or to an active pharmaceutical. Covalent binding can be accomplished in many ways, such as, though not limited to, the use of a commercially available cross-linking compound. [00323] As used herein, the terms “pharmaceutical combination,” “administering an additional therapy,” “administering an additional therapeutic agent” and the like refer to a pharmaceutical therapy resulting from the mixing or combining of more than one active ingredient and includes both fixed and non-fixed combinations of the active ingredients. The term “fixed combination” means that an inhibitor, and at least one co-agent, are both administered to a patient simultaneously in the form of a single entity or dosage. The term “non-fixed combination” means that an inhibitor, and at least one co-agent, are administered to a patient as separate entities either simultaneously, concurrently or sequentially with variable intervening time limits, wherein such administration provides effective levels of the two or more compounds in the body of the patient. These also apply to cocktail therapies, e.g., the administration of three or more active ingredients. [00324] As used herein, the terms “co-administration,” “administered in combination with” and their grammatical equivalents or the like are meant to encompass administration of the selected therapeutic agents to a single patient, and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are administered by the same or different route of administration or at the same or different times. In some embodiments, an inhibitor will be co-administered with other agents. These terms encompass administration of two or more agents to an animal so that both agents and/or their metabolites are present in the animal at the same time. They include simultaneous administration in separate compositions, administration at different times in separate compositions, and/or administration in a composition in which both agents are present. Thus, in some embodiments, an inhibitor and the other agent(s) are administered in a single composition. In some embodiments, an inhibitor and the other agent(s) are admixed in the composition. [00325] As used herein, “anti-cancer agents or treatments” refer to, but are not limited to, a chemotherapeutic agent, a nucleic acid damaging agent, a nucleic acid damaging treatment, an anticancer antibody, an anti-proliferative agent, or an anti-proliferative treatment to the subject. One would understand that the listing of therapeutic regimens listed below represents conventional therapies, but the present embodiments encompass other known therapeutic regimens which are not specifically disclosed herein. [00326] Suitable anti-neoplastic chemotherapeutic agents to be used in the present methods include, but are not limited to, alkylating agents, antimetabolites, natural anti-neoplastic agents, hormonal anti-neoplastic agents, angiogenesis inhibitors, differentiating reagents, RNA inhibitors, antibodies or immunotherapeutic agents, gene therapy agents, small molecule enzymatic inhibitors, biological response modifiers, and anti-metastatic agents. Alkylating agents [00327] Alkylating agents are known to act through the alkylation of macromolecules such as the DNA of cancer cells, and are usually strong electrophiles. This activity can disrupt DNA synthesis and cell division.

Antimetabolites [00328] Antimetabolic anti-neoplastic agents structurally resemble natural metabolites, and are involved in normal metabolic processes of cancer cells such as the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins. They differ enough from the natural metabolites so that they interfere with the metabolic processes of cancer cells. Suitable antimetabolic anti-neoplastic agents to be used in the present methods can be classified according to the metabolic process they affect, and can include, but are not limited to, analogues and derivatives of folic acid, pyrimidines, purines, and cytidine.

Gene Therapy Agents [00337] Gene therapy agents insert copies of genes into a specific set of a patient’s cells, and can target both cancer and non-cancer cells. The goal of gene therapy can be to replace altered genes with functional genes, to stimulate a patient’s immune response to cancer, to make cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy, to place “suicide” genes into cancer cells, or to inhibit angiogenesis. Genes may be delivered to target cells using viruses, liposomes, or other carriers or vectors. This may be done by injecting the gene-carrier composition into the patient directly, or ex vivo, with infected cells being introduced back into a patient. Such compositions are suitable for use in the present methods. Small Molecule Enzymatic Inhibitors [00338] Certain small molecule therapeutic agents are able to target the tyrosine kinase enzymatic activity or downstream signal transduction signals of certain cell receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) or vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (“VEGFR”). Such targeting by small molecule therapeutics can result in anti-cancer effects.

The phosphate in cleaved off at the surface of the enterocyte, creating a local supersaturated solution of free drug that is rapidly absorbed. Anti-Metastatic Agents [00341] The process whereby cancer cells spread from the site of the original tumor to other locations around the body is termed cancer metastasis. Certain agents have anti-metastatic properties, designed to inhibit the spread of cancer cells.

EGFR inhibitor resistance and EGFR inhibitors [00361] Over-expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or its ligand TGFa, is frequently associated with, for example, breast, lung and head and neck cancer, and is believed to contribute to the malignant growth of these tumors. The development of compounds that inhibit the kinase activity of the EGFR, as well as antibodies that block EGFR activation, for use as anti-tumor agents is an area of intense research effort. [00362] Epidermal growth factor (EGF), acting through its receptor EGFR, is a mitogen and survival factor for epithelial cells (Rheinwald, J. G. and Green, Η., 1977, Nature 265, 421; Rodeck, U. et al., 1997, J. Cell Science 110, 113). Thus, there is the potential that use of EGFR inhibitors in chemotherapy would interfere with the normal renewal of skin and other epithelial tissues such as the cornea and the lining of the gastrointestinal tract: Toxicity to proliferating tissues such as skin and the G1 tract is frequently a dose-limiting side effect of cytotoxic agents. Such toxicity may be manifested, among other symptoms, as a skin rash, diarrhea, comeal thinning, hair atrophy or loss, hair follicle dysplasia, degeneration, necrosis or inflammation, interfollicular epidermal hyperplasia, or a failure to heal or a delayed healing after injury. [00363] As used herein, the term “EGFR inhibitor” refers to any EGFR inhibitor that is currently known in the art or that will be identified in the future, and includes any entity that, upon administration to a patient, results in inhibition of a biological activity associated with activation of the EGFRs in the patient, including any of the downstream biological effects otherwise resulting from the binding to an EGFR of its natural ligand. Such EGFR inhibitors include any agent that can block EGFR activation or any of the downstream biological effects of EGFR activation that are relevant to treating cancer in a patient. Such an inhibitor can act by binding directly to the intracellular domain of the receptor and inhibiting its kinase activity. Alternatively, such an inhibitor can act by occupying the ligand binding site or a portion thereof of the EGFR receptor or a portion thereof, thereby making the receptor inaccessible to its natural ligand so that its normal biological activity is prevented or reduced. EGFR inhibitors include but are not limited to low molecular weight inhibitors, antibodies or antibody fragments, antisense constructs and ribozymes. In a preferred embodiment, the EGFR inhibitor is a small organic molecule or an antibody that binds specifically to the human EGFR.

Example 1: Structure-Based Prediction of NDGA Kinase Allosteric Binding Site [00373] Three X-ray crystal structures of IGF1-R, EGFR, and c-Met in the active form were selected from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and converted to a full-atom models for structural analysis. Three allosteric pockets common to each of the three kinases were identified. The allosteric pockets are located next to the Alpha C in the N-terminal lobe, in the substrate binding cleft, and in the C-terminal lobe. Ligand docking and scoring was used to discriminate which of the three pockets is the NDGA binding pocket. The substrate binding pocket was determined to be the most likely NDGA binding pocket. Results X-Ray Crystal Structure Selection [00374] The PDB was mined to find human kinase domain structures of IGF1R, EGFR, and c-Met for this work. For this study we chose to work with the following kinase structures: 3Q6W (c-Met)1, 1Μ17 (EGFR)2, and 1Κ3Α (IGF1R)3 (data not shown). The structures were selected based on their active conformation form, resolution, and sequence coverage. Each of the structures are co-crystallized with a ligand in the ATP pocket, the N-terminal lobe is closed due to the alpha C to beta3 salt bridge, and the activation loop is ordered. One of the structures (IGF1R - PDB 1Κ3Α) has a peptide bound to the activation loop. A four residue segment of PDB 3Q6W (residues 1240-1243) which is disordered was remodeled using standard ICM protein modeling protocols4'6 . Identification of Potential NDGA Allosteric Binding Pockets [00375] NDGA binds to IGF1R, EGFR, and c-Met; therefore, it is reasonable to assume that there is a pocket common to each structure. Here the ligand binding pockets were identified and the likely binding site determined. Pocket Finder Method [00376] Hydrogen atoms were added to each of the three kinase structures and a determination of the correct orientation of Asn and Gin side-chains was made. Histidine residues were optimized to determine the best orientation and protonation state, the correct charges were added to Asp, Glu, Lys and Arg and all water molecules and Het atoms were removed. [00377] MolSoff s ICMPocketFinder algorithm7,8 was used to identify potential ligand binding pockets in the three kinase X-Ray crystal structures. The ICMPocketFinder method is based on a transformation of the Lennard-Jones potential and builds a grid map of a binding potential, and the position and size of the ligand binding pocket are determined based on the construction of equipotential surfaces along those maps. The pockets were assessed on their "druggability" properties and potential propensity to bind a small molecule. Three Conserved Pockets Identified in the Target Kinases [00378] Three allosteric pockets were found in the same location in c-Met, EGFR, and IGF1R data not shown). [00379] The Alpha C Pocket is located in the N-terminal region of the kinase between Alpha C and the Beta 9 to Beta 10 loop. [00380] The Substrate Pocket is located in the region of the activation loop and Beta 7 and Beta 10. [00381] The C-terminal Pocket is formed by Alpha F to Alpha G and Alpha G to Alpha Η loops. This pocket is distal to both the ATP pocket and activation loop. Prediction of the NDGA Binding Pocket by Ligand Docking [00382] Ligand docking and scoring were used to discriminate which of the three allosteric pockets (Alpha C, Substrate, and C-terminal) binds NDGA. This in silica approach provides a prediction about how well NDGA fits into each pocket. Docking NDGA to the Allosteric Pockets [00383] Five types of interaction potentials represented each of the three pockets in the three kinases. The potentials included (i) van der Waals potential for a hydrogen atom probe; (ii) van der Waals potential for a heavy-atom probe (generic carbon of 1.7 A radius; (iii) optimized electrostatic term; (iv) hydrophobic terms; and (ν) loan-pair-based potential, which reflects directional preferences in hydrogen bonding. The energy terms are based on the all-atom vacuum force field ECEPP/3 with appended terms to account for solvation free energy and entropic contribution. Conformational sampling was based on the biased probability Monte Carlo (BPMC) procedure4, which randomly selects a conformation in the internal coordinate space and then makes a step to a new random position independent of the previous one but according to a predefined continuous probability distribution. It has also been shown that after each random step, full local minimization greatly improves the efficiency of the procedure. The ICM program relies on global optimization of the entire flexible ligand in the receptor field and combines large-scale random moves of several types with gradient local minimization and a search history mechanism. NDGA Pocket Discrimination - Preference for Substrate Pocket [00384] Once the ligand was docked to each pocket a score was then calculated to determine how well the ligand fits into each pocket. The scoring function gives a good approximation of the binding free energy between a ligand and a receptor and is a function of different energy terms based on a force-field. The ICM scoring function9 is weighted according to the following parameters (i) internal force-field energy of the ligand, (ii) entropy loss of the ligand between bound and unbound states, (iii) ligand-receptor hydrogen bond interactions, (iv) polar and nonpolar solvation energy differences between bound and unbound states, (ν) electrostatic energy, (vi) hydrophobic energy, and (vii) hydrogen bond donor or acceptor desolvation. The lower the ICM score, the better the prediction that the NDGA ligand binds to that pocket. [00385] Table 5 shows the ICM docking scores for each of the pockets in the three kinase structures. Although the differences in the scores are not dramatic the scores are consistently better for NDGA docked to the Substrate Binding Pocket. Table 5. Docking scores for NDGA in each of the three conserved pockets: the lower the docking score, the better the prediction that NDGA binds. Based on the docking score NDGA prefers the substrate pocket compared to the other two pockets (Alpha C and C-terminal). Pocket c-Met EGFR IGF1R Alpha C Pocket -17 -15 -17 Substrate Pocket -20 -28 -21 C-terminal Pocket -16 -17 -10 [00386] The poses of the ligand in IGF1R and c-Met match well to the substrate peptide binding pose seen in the crystal structure (data not shown). The docked pose matches well with the substrate peptide bound (data not shown) to the IGF1R crystal structure. Docking NDGA Monoglucuronide and Monosulfate to the Substrate Binding Pocket [00387] Table 6 shows a comparison of the binding scores for NDGA, NDGA monoglucuronide, and NDGA monosulfate in the substrate binding pocket. [00388] The model suggests that the addition of a monoglucuronide or sulfate to the catechol ring will not improve or have a detrimental effect on binding, the binding scores were similar (but slightly lower) to those obtained with NDGA. The docking score is primarily designed to discriminate ligand binders from non-binders, therefore, unless significant detailed SAR is available, it will not be able to rank the ligands by experimentally determined binding affinity. Table 6. Docking scores for NDGA, NDGA monoglucuronide, and NDGA to monosulfate to the three kinases. c-Met EGFR IGF1R NDGA -20 -28 -21 NDGA monoglucuronide -18 -25 -12 NDGA monosulfate -17 -28 -18 Docking NDGA Metabolites to the Substrate Binding Pocket [00389] Table 7 shows a comparison of the binding scores for NDGA, or metabolies thereof, in the substrate binding pocket where G = Glue, Μ = Methyl and S = Sulfate. Table 7 Metabolite IGFR EGFR c-Met NDGA (for reference) -21 -28 -20 R1 = G, R4 = G -10 -21 -1 R1 = G, R2 = Μ, R4 = G -3 -23 -5 R1 = Μ, R2 = G, R4 = G -19 -11 -7 R1 = G, R4 = S -24 -21 -11 ! R2 R3 R4 About MolSoft's ICM Technology Used in this Work [00390] All pocket modeling was undertaken using MolSoft's ICM desktop modeling software package. ICM is based on the internal coordinates (IC) representation of molecular objects and naturally reflects the covalent bond geometry of molecules4,5. The method is supported by an accurate internal coordinate force field and a very efficient conformational state sampling algorithm BPMC4. ICM is one of the most advanced modeling tools available today for conformational analysis of flexible proteins and their interactions with ligands. The software is used worldwide in pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as academic research laboratories. Conclusions [00391] The predicted binding pocket for NDGA is in the substrate binding region close to the activation loop (data not shown). Based on kinase biological and structural knowledge it is clear that out of the three common pockets found in this study the substrate binding site is the most likely and effective site for an allosteric inhibitor to bind. For example, it is uncertain how an inhibitor binding in the C-terminal pocket could disrupt substrate binding. The alpha C pocket could possibly be a good site because it may interfere with the N-terminal lobe movement, but in each case the docking scores were better for the substrate binding pocket. It is also encouraging how well the docked poses of NDGA in IGF1R and c-Met match the interactions seen with the substrate (data not shown). Example 2: Metabolite Profiling of NDGA After Oral Administration in Male CD-I Mice: Dosing, Sampling, and Analysis OBJECTIVE [00392] The objectives of this study were to perform profiling of metabolites of test compound NDGA after oral dosing in male CD-I mice and to determine in vitro whole blood stability. SUMMARY [00393] Multiple metabolites were detected in plasma samples of the dosed animals. Based on the results of High Resolution Accurate Mass Measurements and acquired MS/MS data, the detected metabolites appear to be generated via complex Phase II metabolism (conjugation). [00394] The results of semi-quantitative determination of plasma concentration of metabolites vs. time allows the metabolites to be divided into three groups - “first-formed,” mirroring the concentration of the parent test compound; “later-formed,” whose concentration increased over the investigated time interval; and plausible subjects of enterohepatic recycling, leading to a “saw-like” pattern. The results are summarized in Table 8. Table 8. Summary of Pharmacokinetics of Test Compound and Metabolites in Mouse Plasma.

Table 9. Stability of NDGA in whole blood. Time (minutes) Analyte 0 15 30 60 NDGA 100 7.2 NF NF NF- peak not found [00396] The MS signal of NDGA in samples prepared from whole blood appears to be very low, possibly indicating poor recovery (see Results). No putative metabolites were detected upon incubation in whole blood in vitro. EXPERIMENTAL [00397] The dosing solution was prepared at a nominal concentration of 20 mg/mL; detailed description is shown in Appendix I. The actual concentration, established using HPLC-MS, was 84.9% of nominal (+/- 8.9%) and was within the acceptable range according to the study protocol. Animal dosing and blood collection were performed according to the study protocol; details are shown in Appendix II. No adverse effects were observed in the dosed animals. Plasma samples were prepared from blood according to the study protocol. Aliquots of the stabilized (with ascorbic acid) plasma samples were treated with MeCN (1:3 ratio) containing a mixture of internal standards (metoprolol, propranolol, and warfarin, each at 500 ng/mL) for protein precipitation. After centrifugation, clear supernatants were analyzed directly using LC-High Resolution Accurate Mass Spectrometry (HRAMS) as described below. [00398] The incubation of test compound NDGA in pooled whole blood (η=3 animals) was carried out at +37°C for 60 minutes, according to the study protocol. The aliquots were treated with MeCN (1:3 ratio) containing a mixture of internal standards (metoprolol, propranolol, and warfarin, each at 500 ng/mL) for protein precipitation. After centrifugation, supernatants were analyzed directly using LC-HRAMS as described below. METABOLITE PROFILING: INTRODUCTION [00399] The samples were separated using HPLC, and two stationary phases were evaluated: ACE pentaflurophenyl C18 (Phenomenex) and dC18 (Waters). Elution of the components was achieved using a linear gradient of MeCN/MeOH (1/1) in water at a constant level of AcOH (0.1%). [00400] The eluted components were ionized (positive and negative mode; separate injections) and generated ions were surveyed using the LTQ Orbitrap hybrid instrument. The MS instrument combines a linear ion trap (LTQ) and high-resolution FT mass analyzer (Orbitrap). [00401] The survey MS scans were performed on the Orbitrap FT analyzer operated at a resolution of Rs=30,000 (m/z range 150-900 μ). The cycle starts with an FT pre-scan. In this pre-scan, the FT analyzer is operated at a high acquisition rate and a lower resolution (Rs=7500), and the results are used to calculate optimal parameters for the survey’s high-resolution scan. The pre-scan also returns corresponding m/z values of all ions present in the HPLC eluate. [00402] Following the pre-scan, the FT analyzer is set to perform a slow survey scan at high resolution (FIRMS). In parallel, the LTQ ion trap is set to acquire MS(n) data using a data-dependent acquisition (DDA) event. The DDA consists of the decision event and two MS2 product ion scans. The decision event selects the two most intense ions detected in the pre-scan which are on the parent mass list. [00403] Automatically generated PDF files containing detailed method information are sent separately. [00404] The data were processed using Metworks™ software (ν 1.3.0, Thermo). The data processing is comprised of two steps: 1) Subtraction of the chromatogram of a control sample (solvent control in blank matrix) from the analyzed sample, leading to creation of a “SUB” file (Appendix II). This file contains peaks of components unique to the analyzed sample and peaks of components with intensities in the analyzed sample at least two times higher (S/N ratio) than in the control sample. 2) A search for major unique peaks present in “SUB” (“chro” search) for comprehensive metabolite detection. [00405] Finally, the “SUB” file and the results of automatic detection were subjected to manual evaluation. RESULTS. DETECTION OF METABOLITES [00406] Similar to the results obtained previously on a triple quad instrument, detection in negative mode on an LTQ-Orbitrap instrument led to much higher apparent sensitivity for both the parent compound and putative metabolites as compared to detection in the positive mode. Therefore, all results of metabolite detection were obtained in negative mode unless indicated otherwise. [00407] Data processing for detection of putative metabolites was performed using all time points. The peak of the parent compound was detected in all samples. As an illustration, FIG. 1 shows the ion extraction chromatogram (XIC) of the peak of the parent compound across data points. Determination of Relative Abundances of the Metabolites Using Area Under Curve Approach. [00408] For semi-quantitative comparison of generated metabolites, a ratio of peak areas of the detected metabolites and the parent compound versus the internal standard was used to construct kinetics of metabolite formation and calculate corresponding AUCs using the trapezoidal approximation. Table 10 shows the results. Table 10. Peak area ratios of parent compound and reported putative metabolites versus internal standard.

From a separate experiment from that described above. CONCLUSION. DETECTION AND STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION OF THE PUTATIVE METABOLITES [00411] Multiple metabolites were detected in plasma samples of the dosed animals. Based on the results of HRAMS measurements and acquired MS2 data, all detected metabolites were assigned to be products of complex Phase II metabolism (conjugations). The results of semiquantitative determination of plasma concentration of metabolites allows the metabolites to be divided into three groups - “first-formed,” mirroring the concentration of the parent test compound; “later formed,” whose concentration increased over the investigated time interval; and plausible subjects of enterohepatic recycling, leading to a “saw -like” pattern. RESULTS. DETERMINATION OF THE WHOLE BLOOD STABILITY AND DETECTION OF PUTATIVE METABOLITES [00412] The results of determination of the stability of NDGA in freshly drawn whole blood of CD-I mice (pooled from three animals) are summarized in Table 11. Table 11. Stability of NDGA in whole blood Analyte Time (minutes) 0 15 30 60 NDGA 100 7.2 NF NF NF- peak not found [00413] The MS signal of NDGA in samples prepared from whole blood appears to be very low, possibly indicating poor recovery. For illustrative purposes, FIG. 20 shows the peak of ΤΤ100 in the Τ=0 minute sample and the peak of an internal standard (warfarin) alongside with the recorded HRAMS spectra. CONCLUSION. DETERMINATION OF THE WHOLE BLOOD STABILITY AND DETECTION OF THE PUTATIVE METABOLITES [00414] The test compound NDGA appears to be unstable in whole blood sample. However, the obtained quantitative results (as well as results of the detection of the putative metabolites) could be negatively impacted by possible poor recovery of NDGA from whole blood. Optimization of the recovery from whole blood was beyond the scope of the current study protocol. DOSING SOLUTION PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS [00415] The dosing solution was analyzed using an LC-targeted EPI method implemented on a QTRAP 4000 instrument. Two replicates were injected alongside two standard samples (100% of nominal). The measured concentration of dosing solution was 84.9+/-8.9% and standard 100+/-4.7%. The measured concentration is within the acceptable range. TOTAL ION CURRENT CHROMATOGRAMS AND SURVEY MS SPECTRA OF ADDITIONAL PUTATIVE METABOLITES [00416] The Total Ion Current (TIC) trace of the “SUB” file (Τ=1 hour) is shown in the upper pane in each case; the lower pane shows the HRAMS spectrum for a different retention time interval (indicated by the blue line). The plausible peaks of additional putative metabolites are indicated by red arrows (See Figures. 21-23).

ANALYTICAL METHOD EVALUATION: Method Development: 1. LC-MS/MS analytical method for NDGA has previously been established at Absorption Systems in female Balb/c mouse plasma under study 11TRIAP2R2. 2. LC-HRAMS method set-up using system suitability samples. 3. Further method optimization for analysis of NDGA in male CD-I mouse plasma and whole blood may be conducted per Absorption Systems’ discretion. In Vitro Whole Blood Stability: 1. Single incubation (Ν=1) of one concentration (1 μΜ) of test compound in fresh whole blood collected from untreated CD-1 mice and incubate for up to 1 hour at room temperature. 2. Sampling from the whole blood incubation at 0, 15, 30, and 60 min. 3. LC-HRAMS quantification of the test compound and metabolite ID/profiling in each whole blood sample. Data Acquisition and Processing: 1. From the in vivo experiment: Aliquots of plasma sample will be pooled across η=3 animals at each sampling time point, i. ℮., η=3 samples pooled for each time point resulting in a total 6 plasma samples (total 6 time points) for sample analysis. 2. From the in vitro experiment: All sample aliquots of whole blood sample (total 4 whole blood samples) analyzed. 3. Plasma and whole blood samples are typically extracted with organic solvent containing an appropriate internal standard. 4. Samples will be analyzed using a LTQ-ORBITRAP XL mass spectrometer. 5. Detection methodology: High Resolution Mass Scan (HRAMS) - Data Dependent acquisition (DDA) - MS(n). 6. HRAMS scan will be performed in an appropriate m/z range in order to detect the test compound and all plausible metabolites which could be formed in the particular matrix (i.e. Phase I and Phase II). The typical range for detection of both Phase I and II metabolites is ~ 1/2 of MW or 150 amu (whichever is lower) to MW+400 amu. The Orbitrap will be operated at resolution no less than 30,000. 7. The instrument method will trigger automatic MS/MS data acquisition on most intense ions observed in HRAMS using pre-defined criteria. 8. Data processing will be performed using Metworks and MS Frontier software packages. Typically, it involves combination of searches for the metabolites based on their exact mass (using built-in and/or customized list of biotransformation(s), as well as search for the major unique peaks (components) present in the in vivo sample but not in control sample at S/N > 3. In addition, multiple mass defect filters (MMDF) can be used to filter false positive peaks. 9. Optional:: If glucuronides for metabolites are detected, further experiments can be performed, per Customer’s request, to differentiate between different types of glucuronides (0-, Ν-, or acyl glucuronides) based on the chemical properties of the glucuronides. Determining AUC, Relative Abundance, and Kinetics of Metabolite Formation: 1. On both incurred in vivo plasma and in vitro whole blood samples. 2. MS quantification of parent test compound and metabolites that meet the above defined criteria (S/N > 3) will be performed in all incurred plasma samples. 3. Up to 10 major metabolites with an AUC (based on PARR vs time) > 5% of the parent test compound AUC will be reported. 4. Relative abundance/rank order is provided based on the AUC. 5. AUC profile is provided for each metabolite in order to determine the kinetics of metabolite formation. Improved Quantification of Metabolites From In Vivo Samples (Optional): 1. Reference metabolite mixture is generated using appropriate in vitro system and metabolite profile is compared to that in the in vivo sample. 2. If the match is satisfactory, the in vitro incubation sample is concentrated (10-50 fold) and analyzed using LC-UV-MS(n) method to record and compare UV spectra of parent drug and metabolites of interest. 3. If UV spectra are similar, correction factors based on peak area ratios in the extracted wavelengths chromatograms are established to calculate molar ratio of analytes in the concentrated sample. 4. The concentrated sample is diluted back to original level using post-extract supernatant from blank matrix and the obtained sample re-analyzed using quantitative (MS) bioanalytical method. 5. The correction factors for the MS responses of analytes is calculated based on the UV data and the level of metabolites are re-calculated to express it as molar percentage compared to the parent. Structure Elucidation: 1. The structure assignment of up to ten putative metabolites in plasma will be performed. 2. The structure assignment of the detected metabolites is based on: a. Elaboration of recorded MS(n) data of metabolites via fragmentation of the proposed chemical structures. b. Comparison with established fragmentation pathway(s) of the parent drug. c. The elucidation process may also involve additional sample re-analysis using LC-MSn methods and/or acquiring MS/MS data using exact mass capabilities for additional confirmation of assigned structures.

EXAMPLE 4: In Vivo Treatment of Human Breast Adenocarcinoma [00424] The in vivo antitumor effect of a catecholic butane metabolite is determined against MX-1 (human breast adenocarcinoma) cells. [00425] Male or female athymic ΒALB/c mice, six to eight weeks of age and weighing 20 to 35 grams are used. MX-1 cells are cultured in the standard RPMI-1640 media and implanted subcutaneously in the flank of the nude mice in order to propagate the tumor line. Nude mice are implanted with 25 mg of the MX-1 solid tumor fragments. Tumors which reach the 25-100 mm2 range are used for the experiment. Test compound (0.1 mL) is injected directly into the tumor. [00426] The tumors are measured periodically to determine their weight calculated by using half the product of the length (L) times the width (W) times the height (Η) of the tumor. The procedure is repeated at regular intervals until 60 days after the initial treatment or all mice have died. Mice which show no evidence of tumors are kept for 60 days to evaluate the potential for tumor recurrence at which time tumor characteristics, if any, are recorded. EXAMPLE 5: Anti-cancer Therapy of Preformed Human Breast Cancer Tumors [00427] The effect of a catecholic butane metabolite described herein can be assessed with respect to their anti-cancer effect on preformed human breast cancer tumors in human skin grafted into SCID mice. [00428] Briefly, MCF-7 cells (8χ106 cells in 0.1 ml PBS) are transplanted intradermally into human full-thickness skin grafted into SCID mice when the grafts showed no signs of inflammation, contraction or rejection. The mice are left untreated until distinct palpable tumors (3 to 6 mm in diameter in most cases) appear. Mice with distinct tumors are divided into groups for the therapeutic studies. Control animals are administered sterile PBS intravenously (i.v.) via the tail vein. Groups of test animals (4 mice per group) are administered 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg, of a catecholic butane metabolite intravenously (i.v.) via the tail vein. Administration is as follows: once per week; twice per week; three times daily for three weeks with one week hiatus; two times daily for three weeks with one week hiatus; or one time daily for three weeks with one week hiatus. [00429] Additional groups of mice may be added to test for combination therapy of a catecholic butane metabolite with an EGFR inhibitor, an IGF-1R inhibitor, or both. [00430] During the treatment, mice are monitored daily for tumor size and morbidity. Mice are weighed twice a week using an electronic balance (OHAUS™ Model GT210). Tumor size is measured three times a week using an electronic caliper (PRO-MAX 6 inch caliper; Fowler Co., Newton, Mass.) connected to a computer using OptoDemo™ software (Fowler Co.). The measured tumor diameters are converted to tumor volumes using the following formula: V = length x width χ height χ pi/6. Statistical analysis of the data for the comparison of different groups of mice is carried out using Student's t-test. EXAMPLE 6: SCID Mouse Model for Ovarian Cancer [00431] To determine the ability of a catecholic butane metabolite to treat ovarian cancer, an ovarian cancer cell line may be used in SCID mice. [00432] Briefly, ovarian cancer cells are implanted into SCID mice to generate ovarian tumors. Groups of mice bearing established tumors are treated by i.v. administration of escalating doses (starting at 5 mg/kg body weight) of a catecholic butane metabolite. Control animals are treated with sterile PBS. Additional groups of mice may be added to test for combination therapy of a catecholic butane metabolite with an EGFR inhibitor, an IGF-1R inhibitor, or both. [00433] Mice are monitored and tumor growth is measured via sacrifice of animals on a weekly basis. Tumors are measured as described above. EXAMPLE 7: SCID Mouse Model for Kidney Cancer [00434] To determine the ability of a catecholic butane metabolite to treat kidney cancer, a kidney cancer cell line is used in SCID mice. [00435] Briefly, kidney cancer cells are implanted into SCID mice to generate kidney tumors. Groups of mice bearing established tumors are treated by i.v. administration of escalating doses (starting at 5 mg/kg body weight) of a catecholic butane metabolite. Control animals are treated with sterile PBS. Additional groups of mice may be added to test for combination therapy of a catecholic butane metabolite with an EGFR inhibitor, an IGF-1R inhibitor, or both. [00436] Mice are monitored and tumor growth is measured via sacrifice of animals on a weekly basis. Tumors are measured as described above. EXAMPLE 8: Evaluation of the Anti-Proliferative Activity of NDGA in Cancer Cell Lines [00437] In vitro studies may be used to evaluate the anti-proliferative activity of a single test compound, NDGA on lung cancer cell lines Η1975, Α427 and Α549. [00438] The first study measures the anti-proliferative activity of the compound in a cancer cell line. The second study will evaluate the anti-proliferative of the test agent in mouse plasma activity in a cancer cell line. ΜΤΤ Cell Proliferation and/or CyQuant™ assays may be used for this purpose. [00439] The ΜΤΤ assay (Invitrogen) is a colorimetric assay for measuring the activity of cellular enzymes that reduce the tetrazolium dye, ΜΤΤ, to its insoluble formazan, giving a purple color. This assay measures cellular metabolic activity via NAD(P)H-dependent cellular oxidoreductase enzymes and may, under defined conditions, reflects the number of viable cells (cell proliferation). Tetrazolium dye assays can also be used to measure cytotoxicity (loss of viable cells) or cytostatic activity (shift from proliferative to resting status) of potential medicinal agents and toxic materials [00440] The CyQuant™ assay (Invitrogen) may be used to differentiate antioxidant activity from anti-proliferative activity. Briefly, the assay is based on dye fluorescence enhancement upon binding to cellular nucleic acids. Cells are lysed by addition of a buffer containing the CyQUANT™-GR dye; there are no washing steps, growth medium changes or long incubations. The resulting fluorescence is proportional to the number of cells in the sample and is measured directly using the TD-700 fluorometer equipped with a fluorescein filter kit. The CyQUANT™ assay can detect much lower cell numbers than Neutral Red or methylene blue assays. (2,3,4) Unlike procedures that rely on the conversion of tetrazolium dyes to blue formazan (5) products or 3Η thymidine incorporation assays, (6) the CyQUANT™ method is rapid and does not rely on cellular metabolic activity. Thus, cells can be frozen prior to assaying; time course assays are facile and data obtained from samples taken at widely different time intervals can be directly compared. A.

EXAMPLE 9: Effect of metabolites on cell survival / proliferation of NSCLC cell lines [00456] The following experiments measured the effect of NDGA, or a metabolite thereof, on cell survival/proliferation in three NSCLC cell lines in the presence of mouse serum in two assay formats. A: 10% Serum from untreated mice spiked with drug [00457] The effect of NDGA, or a metabolite thereof, on cell proliferation/survival was measured in three NSCLC cell lines cultured in the presence of 10% mouse serum obtained from untreated mice. [00458] Briefly, cells were cultured for 72 hours in medium from untreated mice spiked with NDGA, or a metabolite thereof, at concentrations of from 1-300 mM. Cell number differences were measured using the CyQuant® assay (Invitrogen). [00459] Η1975, Α427, Α549 cells were seeded at 1χ104 cells/well in a 96 well plate and incubated overnight at 37°C. [00460] 24 hours later, triplicate wells were treated with 10% mouse serum each spiked in-vitro with NDGA, or a metabolite thereof, at 0, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 and 300 mM concentration. [00461] In parallel, a set of triplicate wells was treated with 10% pooled mouse serum obtained from five mice administered 300mg/Kg NDGA, or a metabolite thereof, and sacrificed 2 hrs later. [00462] The plates were incubated for 72h at 37°C and the relative cell number per well was determined using the CyQuant® reagent. Fluorescence was measured using a Molecular Devices plate reader. [00463] The CyQuant® assay was performed 24 hours after cell plating (“Initial”) and following 72 hour exposure to 10% mouse serum without NDGA, or a metabolite thereof, or 10% FBS (control). [00464] Compared to cells cultured in 10% FBS, cell growth in the presence of 10% mouse serum was reduced in untreated cells 22%, 14% and 6% in Α427, Α549 and Η9175 cells (data not shown). [00465] Addition of 10% serum from untreated mice to growth medium induced a modest inhibition (14%, average) of cell proliferation when compared with medium containing 10% FBS (data not shown). [00466] NDGA, or a metabolite thereof, induced a dose-related decrease in cell number in cells cultured in 10% mouse serum. [00467] Reduced cell proliferation was observed at concentrations of NDGA, or a metabolite thereof, above of 10 mM and at the maximum concentration of NDGA, or a metabolite thereof, tested (300mM); cell number was reduced by 33% when all cell lines were averaged (data not shown). [00468] NDGA, or a metabolite thereof, was observed to inhibit cell proliferation and/or induce cytotoxicity in a dose-related manner in NSCLC lines when cultured in the presence of 10% mouse serum spiked with drug. Β: Pharmacodynamic Analysis of TT-100 in Mouse Serum [00469] Mice were orally administered 300 mg/Kg NDGA, or a metabolite thereof, in 0.5% CMC and serum collected 2 hours following treatment. [00470] Serum from five animals was pooled, mixed with culture medium at a concentration of 10% and cells incubated for 72 hours. Cell number was then determined using the CyQuant® assay. [00471] Difference in cell number in NSCLC cells treated with serum from mice administered vehicle control (VC) and 300 mg/Kg NDGA, or a metabolite thereof, were determined (data not shown). Differences in cell number for cells cultured in 10% serum was compared by t-test. Ρ values are: Α427, ρ=0.009; Α549, ρ=0.133; and Η9175, ρ=0.744. [00472] The number of cells after culture in the presence of 10% serum from treated mice was observed to decrease in two cell lines. In one, Α427, the decrease was statistically significant (ρ=.009) while in the other, Α549 the ρ value was not significant at the 0.05 level (ρ = 0.133).
