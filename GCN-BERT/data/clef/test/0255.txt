Each of these applications is incorporated herein in its entirety. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention refers to the compounds corresponding to the following general formula (I): wherein: R═C4-C8 alkanoyl; andX═NH—R1 where R1═H, or protecting group for amines;and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Preferred compounds according to the present invention are represented by the following formula (Ia): wherein: R═C4-C8 alkanoyl;and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In a preferred embodiment, an object of the present invention is to provide 5-amino-2-(butyryloxy)benzoic acid and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, preferably hydrochloride salt. A further object of the present invention is represented by the use of the compounds of formula (Ia), in particular 5-amino-2-(butyryloxy)benzoic acid and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as a medicament and by the use thereof for the treatment of intestinal inflammatory diseases. The present invention also regards the synthesis processes to obtain such compounds and some intermediate compounds of said synthesis processes. STATE OF THE ART 5-aminosalicylic acid (hereinafter also referred to as 5-ASA or mesalazine) represents one of the fundamental and historically used drugs in the therapy of both acute and chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases. Actually, it is preferably used for the treatment of IBD, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and IBS. (Regueiro et al. Clinical Guidelines for the Medical Management of left-side ulcerative colitis and ulcerative proctitis: summary statement; Kormbluth A et al. Ulcerative colitis practice guidelines in adults: American college of gastroenterology, practice parameters committee). Such active ingredient has a topical anti-inflammatory action at the intestinal lumen level, with consequent inhibition of biosynthesis of the chemical mediators of the inflammatory process, derivatives of arachidonic acid such as prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2 and leukotrienes. Mesalazine does not react systemically but only topically at contact with the mucosa of the lower intestine, distal ileum and colon, selective sites of acute and chronic idiopathic flogosis. Administered orally, mesalazine should thus reach the sites of the disease through tablets or granulates with modified release, a formulation which goes through the stomach and the small intestine unaltered, releasing the active ingredient solely in the distal ileum and, above all, in the colon. Mesalazine is administered rectally preferably in aqueous suspension in form of retention enema, or in suppositories, rectal foam and anorectal gel. Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) are used for treating intestinal inflammatory diseases. They are used in topical formulations, especially in patients with rectal ulcerative colitis, and in oral formulations, in association with conventional therapy. This family of fatty acids, which comprises acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, butyric acid, isovaleric acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, lactic acid and succinic acid is considered the main source of energy for the cells of the colon mucosa and a fundamental factor for controlling the growth of the mucosa. The food sources of short chain fatty acids are quite limited; they are produced especially during the fermentation of fibres carried out by the bacteria found in the colon. In particular, among these short chain fatty acids, butyric acid represents the largest source of energy for colonocytes to a point that deficiency thereof determines atrophy of the mucosa. In addition, it seems to have positive effects in the prevention of colon cancer given that in vitro, it has proven not only the capacity to inhibit the proliferation of carcinogenic cells but also to stimulate differentiation thereof. Furthermore, short chain fatty acids perform an anti-inflammatory role on the colon mucosa. Also regarding butyric acid and derivatives, which perform therapeutic activity thereof locally in acute or chronic intestinal diseases, there arises the need of oral administration through modified release tablets or in form of enema as specified above regarding mesalazine. Moreover, chronic diseases contrary to acute conditions which can have a rapid onset and/or a short course, are persistent or long-lasting diseases. A chronic condition is also further distinguished from a recurrent course; recurrent diseases relapse rapidly, with periods of remission or prolonged absence of symptoms in between. Patients suffering from such a condition thus experience alternating periods of active disease and periods of remission. It is therefore desirable to provide compounds which are efficient either in the active phase of the disease or in the remission phase so as to avoid the reacutization of the disease. Novel derivatives of mesalazine which are particularly advantageous in the cure of both acute and chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases have now been discovered; in particular, a novel compound capable of combining the therapeutic effects of mesalazine and butyric acid, i.e. 5-amino-2-(butyryloxy)benzoic acid and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, such as hydrochloride have been surprisingly discovered.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is represented by the compounds corresponding to the following general formula (I): wherein: R═C4-C8 alkanoyl; andX═NH—R1 where R1═H, or protecting group for amines, preferably the tert-butyloxycarbonyl group (Boc);and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The expression “protecting group for amines” refers to the text “Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third edition, pages. 503-648”, incorporated herein for reference. Preferred compounds according to the present invention are represented by the following formula (Ia): wherein: R═C4-C8 alkanoyl;and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In a preferred embodiment, an object of the present invention is to provide 5-amino-2-(butyryloxy)benzoic acid and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, preferably hydrochloride salt (compound (IV)). The compounds of formula (Ia), in particular 5-amino-2-(butyryloxy)benzoic acid and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, preferably hydrochloride salt, as a medicament form a further object of the present invention. In particular, said 5-amino-2-(butyryloxy)benzoic acid and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof intervene as prodrugs capable of releasing the two active ingredients, mesalazine and butyric acid, in the selective sites of the intestinal idiopathic flogosis, distal ileum and colon. The compounds of formula (Ia), in particular 5-amino-2-(butyryloxy)benzoic acid and/or pharmacologically useable salts thereof, for use in the treatment of acute and chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases, among which IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease), ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, diverticular disease, IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) form a further object of the present invention. Preferably, the compounds of formula (Ia) are specifically applied in the treatment of IBD. According to the present invention the aforementioned compounds of formula (Ia) and, in particular 5-amino-2-(butyryloxy)benzoic acid and/or the pharmaceutically useable salts thereof, can be administered to human beings, intended both as an adult subject and as “paediatric population”, where the term “paediatric population” is used to indicate the part of population between birth and eighteen years of age. A pharmaceutical composition containing the compounds of formula (Ia), in particular 5-amino-2-(butyryloxy)benzoic acid and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and at least one physiologically acceptable excipient form a further object of the present invention. Actually, the compounds according to the present invention can be administered to patients affected by acute and chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases, in form of pharmaceutical preparations taking into account the local and non-systemic activity of these active ingredients. The expression “local activity” is used to indicate that the active ingredient should come to contact with the mucosa of the colon. Said pharmaceutical composition may contain the aforementioned compounds in solid form, preferably selected from among tablet, capsule, granule, microgranule, in semi-solid form, preferably selected from among suppository, gel or ointment for rectal administration or topical anal application or in liquid form, preferably selected from among suspension or aqueous solution for oral administration or for rectal administration preferably through enema, or rectal foam. Oral administration may use modified-release preparations which go through the stomach or small intestine unaltered and then release the active ingredient in the colon. Administration of the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention is particularly advantageous in that it allows administering the anti-inflammatory 5-ASA and the intestinal trophic factor, butyric acid, in a single administration, thus improving the patient compliance with respect to a combined administration of the two active ingredients separately. The in vitro and in vivo tests, indicated below in the experimental part, reveal some considerable characteristics of 5-amino-2-(butyryloxy)benzoic acid in form of hydrochloride salt, the compound (IV). It is stable in storage both in the normal (25° C., 60% RH) and accelerated conditions (40° C., 75% RH) as well as in the gastric and in the simulated intestinal fluids; it has a high hydrolysis percentage in both human and murine plasma; it has low permeability through the basolateral membrane of the Caco2 cell line, hence guaranteeing maintaining the topic action of 5-ASA to be released; furthermore, it is quickly metabolised in the rat intestine. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in rats wherein the compound (IV) is administered p.o. and i.v. revealed good pharmacokinetic parameters thereof. The same in vitro and in vivo studies carried out on another conjugated derivative of mesalazine with butyric acid, in particular the derivative of formula (IIIb): on the contrary did not reveal positive results. This shows that not all conjugates of mesalazine with butyric acid are suitable for the treatment of intestinal disease. A further object of the present invention is the process of synthesis of the compounds of formula (Ia) characterised by the following steps: a′) protection of 5-ASA with an amine protecting group to obtain the compounds of formula (II′); b′) acylation of the hydroxyl group of the compounds of formula (II′) to obtain the compounds of formula (III′); c′) deprotection of the amino group. wherein: R═C4-C8 alkanoyl; and R1 is an amine protecting group, preferably the tert-butyloxycarbonyl group (Boc).

The step b) is conducted in presence of a butyryl halide, preferably butyryl chloride and/or butyric anhydride in a molar ratio comprised between 1:1 and 3:1, preferably 2:1 with respect to the compound (II). The step b) is conducted in an aprotic apolar solvent, preferably selected from among an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon, halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon, more preferably dichloromethane, in presence of a base, preferably organic, more preferably diisopropylethylamine, preferably in a 3:1 molar ratio with respect to the compound (II). The step of deprotection c) is conducted in an acidic environment preferably generated by HCl in an aprotic solvent, more preferably by HCl in dioxane or HCl in ethyl ether. Alternatively, the compounds of formula (Ia) can be synthesised according to the following steps: d′) acylation of the hydroxyl group of the nitro derivative (V′) available in the market to obtain the compounds of formula (VI′); e′) hydrogenation of the nitro group of the compounds of formula (VI′) wherein: R═C4-C8 alkanoyl. In particular, Scheme B reported below shows the synthesis for obtaining the 5-amino-2-(butyryloxy)benzoic acid starting from (V′): Such process is characterised by the following steps: d) butyrylation of the nitro derivative (V′) to obtain the compound (VI); e) hydrogenation of the compound (VI) to obtain 5-amino-2-(butyryloxy)benzoic acid. The step d) is conducted in presence of butyric anhydride and/or a butyryl halide, preferably butyric anhydride, preferably in presence of an acid catalysis, preferably sulfuric acid. Said butyric anhydride is used in a molar ratio with respect to the compound (V′) comprised between 1:1 and 5:1, preferably 3:1. Said step d) is conducted at a temperature comprised between 40° C. and 70° C., preferably about 55° C.

The DSS-induced colitis model has been generally accepted and used to screen pharmaceutical drugs at preclinical level for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (3) and it exhibits some of the clinical and histological inflammatory features which are found in humans with ulcerative colitis. DSS-induced inflammation of the colon originates in the distal colon, progressing to involve the whole colon and in severe cases the caecum. In addition, the inflammation is confined to the mucosa and is generally not transmural. Furthermore, DSS-induced inflammation is not dependent on the presence of any specific intestinal bacterial flora. DSS-induced inflammation has been shown to be mitigated by treatment with experimental therapeutic principles, for example, the immuno-suppressant FK506 (4) and it also responds favorably to treatment with cyclosporine, an immunosuppressant drug which is used to treat inflammatory bowel disease in humans (5). Sulphasalazine (SASP) and olsalazine (OLZ) are 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) based drugs have also been found able to ameliorate the DSS-induced intestinal inflammation (3). The dose-response patterns suggested that the active therapeutic moiety for the two drugs appears to be mainly the liberated 5-ASA molecule. On the basis of the above background we have evaluated the therapeutic effect of selected compounds, namely 5-ASA, 5-ASA-butyrate (compound (IV)), butyric acid, and 5-ASA and butyric acid (administered separately) through said colitis model. Colon inflammation has been induced in C57BL/6 mice by the administration of DSS in the drinking water at concentrations of 3%, for 5 days. Several experimental protocols (8 animals per group) have been used for evaluating the therapeutic effect of the aforementioned selected compounds, when compared to placebo either in the active or in the remission phase of the inflammatory disease: DSS 3%+5-ASA orally every dayDSS 3%+5-ASA-butyrate (compound (IV)) orally every dayDSS 3%+butyric acid orally every dayDSS 3%+placebo orally every dayDSS 3%+5-ASA+butyric acid (administered separately) orally every day Different parameters have been measured to test the efficacy of the selected compounds which are: Clinical evaluation: daily recording weight and clinical activity (anal bleeding, presence of diarrhoea). This parameter has been quantified as percentage of body weight and DAI (Disease Activity Index) relating to anal bleeding and presence of diarrhoea. The lower the DAI is, the lower the anal bleeding is, thus better the therapeutic effect is.Endoscopic evaluation: mice underwent endoscopy at the end of the treatment. This step is very important as most of the drugs used in human inflammatory bowel disease aim to achieve mucosal healing.Histological colitis assessment: mice have been sacrificed at the end of the treatment, colons have been removed and histopathological analysis has been performed to assess the extent of tissue damage and recruitment of immune cells. Endoscopic and histological scores as well as the colon length are reported for each administered dose so as to assess the efficacy of the tested compounds in the colitis model. The therapeutic effect has been evaluated with different experimental procedures (a)-c)) representing either the active phase (a)) or the remission phase (b)-c)) of an intestinal inflammatory disease at different doses: a) treatment of acute phase at 200 mg/kg/dayb) treatment of remission phase at 50 mg/kg/dayc) treatment of remission phase at 100 mg/kg/day The active phase of an intestinal inflammatory disease has been represented by the oral administration of one of the selected compounds at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day on the third day after DSS exposure and continuing for further two days (see FIGS. 12-13). The remission phase of an intestinal inflammatory disease has been represented by the oral administration of one of the selected compounds in doses of 50 (see FIGS. 8-9) and 100 mg/kg/day (see FIGS. 10-11) starting two days before DSS exposure and continuing throughout the observation period (5 days). Results of the study can be summarized as follows: a) 5-ASA butyrate and 5-ASA display a comparable therapeutic efficiency (low DAI, low endoscopic and histological scores).b) 5-ASA butyrate displays a better therapeutic activity than that of 5-ASA or butyric acid if administered alone but also of the combined administration of 5-ASA and butyric acid (lower DAI, lower endoscopic and histological scores).c) 5-ASA butyrate displays a better therapeutic activity than that of 5-ASA or butyric acid if administered alone but also of the combined administration of 5-ASA and butyric acid (lower DAI, lower endoscopic and histological scores). These results interestingly show an improved therapeutic activity of one of the compounds of the invention (5-ASA butyrate) in particular in the remission phase of a chronic intestinal inflammatory disease, with respect to that of the combined administration of 5-ASA and butyric acid. The results therefore indicate a significant advance in the art, especially in providing an alternative compound for treating an intestinal inflammatory disease. BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES 1.
