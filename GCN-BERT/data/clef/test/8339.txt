Example 30
To a solution of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.200 g, 0.815 mmol) and benzaldehyde (0.091 g, 0.856 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) with glacial acetic acid (1 mL) in a flamed dried flask. The mixture was stirred for 4 hours prior to addition of excess sodium borohydride (0.070 mg, 1.71 mmol). The mixture was then stirred and monitored by LCMS for completion. Then it was quenced with water and extracted with ethyl acetate (3Ã—20 mL). The combined organic layers were washed once with sat. NaHCO3, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography over silica gel using 95:5 dichloromethane/methanol to give 6-(2-(benzylamino)thiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.099 g, 36%) as a light yellow solid.
