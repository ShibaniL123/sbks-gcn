[0027] There are no particular limitations on the halogenating agent used in the step Bl, and any of the compounds used for performing halogenation in conventional synthesis reactions may be used.

Although there are no particular limitations on the amount used of the halogenating agent, the amount of halogen atoms per 1 mol of the compound represented by formula (2) is preferably within a range from 0.1 to 10 mols, and more preferably from 1 to 5 mols. [0028] Examples of the organic solvent used in the step Β1 include ethers such as diethyl ether, butyl methyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and dimethoxyethane; halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, trichloroethane and dichloroethylene; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, heptane, octane and cyclohexane; esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and propyl acetate; polar aprotic solvents such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, acetonitrile, propionitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, sulfolane, dimethylacetamide and N-methylpyrrolidone; protic solvents such as acetic acid; and water. Of these, from the viewpoints of suppressing side reactions, and ensuring selective halogenation of the methyl group in the compound represented by formula (2), benzene or a halogenated hydrocarbon is preferable. [0029] In the present invention, the step Β1 is preferably performed in the presence of a base.

Among the above bases, sodium hydrogen carbonate is preferred. The amount used of the base is preferably within a range from 0,1 to 10 mols, and more preferably from 0.5 to 2 mols, per 1 mol of the compound represented by formula (2). [0030] There are no particular limitations on the procedure and the like adopted for the reaction between the compound represented by formula (2) and the halogenating agent. For example, the compound represented by formula (2), and where necessary sodium hydrogen carbonate, may be added to the organic solvent, and the halogenating agent then added gradually to the reaction mixture to cause the reaction to proceed. The temperature during the period from the start of the reaction to the completion of the reaction may be either kept at a constant temperature or varied, but is preferably within a range from 0 to 200°C, and more preferably from room temperature to 150°C. [0031] By conducting the step Β1, the methyl group within the compound represented by formula (2) is selectively halogenated. As a result, a reaction product containing a monohalogenated picoline derivative represented by formula (3), a dihalogenated picoline derivative represented by formula (14) and/or a trihalogenated picoline derivative represented by formula (15) is obtained. Subjecting the reaction product to purification by conventional methods to isolate the monohalogenated picoline derivative represented by formula (3) in a high degree of purity requires considerable cost and time. Accordingly, in the present invention, the step Β2 described below is performed. [0033] [Step B2] There are no particular limitations on the method used for reducing the mixed reaction product containing the compounds represented by formula (3), formula (14) and formula (15) obtained in the step Β1.

[0034] There are no particular limitations on the amounts used of the acid and the metal, provided they are sufficient to generate the amount of hydrogen required to effect the reduction reaction. The required amount of hydrogen is preferably within a range from 0.6 to 1.5 mols per 1 mol of the halogenated picoline derivative represented by formula (14), and is preferably within arange from 1,2 to 3.0 mols per 1 mol of the halogenated picoline derivative represented by formula (15). The reduction reaction is typically conducted at a temperature within a range from -20°C to reflux temperature, and preferably at a temperature from 20 to 40°C, [0035] In those cases where the reduction is performed on a reaction product in which X represents a bromine atom, which is obtained by using a brominating agent as the halogenating agent in the step ΒI, a method that includes reacting the reaction product obtained in the step Bl, namely the brominated picoline derivative represented by formula (4) and/or the brominated picoline derivative represented by formula (5), with a phosphite ester and a base within an organic solvent is particularly desirable. [0036] The phosphite ester used in the above method is represented by P(OR)3, wherein the oxidation number of phosphorus is +3. R represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an aryl group or the like, and at least one of the three R groups is a group other than a hydrogen atom, Examples of the phosphite ester include triphenyl phosphite, tris(nonylphenyl) phosphite, tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite, trinonyl phosphite, tridecyl phosphite, trioctyl phosphite, trioctadecyl phosphite, distearylpentaerythritol diphosphite, tricyclohexyl phosphite, monobutyldiphenyl phosphite, monooctyldiphenyl phosphite, distearylpentaerythritol diphosphite, bis(2,4-di-tert-butyIphenyl)pentaerythritol phosphite, bis(2,6“di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenyl)pentaerythritol phosphite, 2,2-methylene-bis(4,6-di-tert-butylphenyl)octyl phosphite, dimethyl phosphite, diethyl phosphite, trimethyl phosphite and triethyl phosphite. The amount used of the phosphite ester is preferably within a range from 0.1 to 20 mols per 1 mol of the brominated picoline derivative represented by formula (4), and is preferably within a range from 0.2 to 40 mols per 1 mol of the brominated picoline derivative represented by formula (5). [0037] Examples of the base used in the above method include alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide; alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as magnesium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; carbonates such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate; hydrides such as sodium hydride and calcium hydride; metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide and magnesium methoxide; and organic bases such as triethyl amine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaminopyridine, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene and l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene. The amount used of the base is preferably within a range from 0.1 to 10 mols per 1 mol of the brominated picoline derivative represented by formula (4), and is preferably within a range from 0.2 to 20 mols per 1 mol of the brominated picoline derivative represented by formula (5). [0038] There are no particular limitations on the procedure and the like adopted for the reaction between the reaction product obtained in the step Bl, the phosphite ester and the base. For example, the reaction may be conducted by gradually adding the phosphite ester, the base, and where necessary a phase transfer catalyst, to an organic solvent solution containing the reaction product obtained in the step Bl. The temperature during the period from the start of the reaction to the completion of the reaction may be either kept at a constant temperature or varied, but is preferably within a range from -70°C to +100°C, and more preferably from -10°C to +50°C, [0039] There are no particular limitations on the organic solvent used in the step Β2, and examples thereof include the same organic solvents available in the step Bl, The reaction product need not necessarily be recovered from the reaction solution obtained in the step Bl, and the reaction solution may simply be used, as is, within the step Β2. [0040] In the present invention, the step Β2 is preferably performed in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst. Examples of the phase transfer catalyst include quaternary ammonium salts; quaternary phosphonium salts such as tetrabutylphosphonium chloride, tetrabutylphosphonium bromide, benzyltrimethylphosphonium chloride and benzyltrimethylphosphonium bromide; and macrocyclic polyethers such as 12-crown-4, 18-crown-6 and benzo-18-crown-6. Among these, the quaternary ammonium salts are preferred, [0041] Examples of the quaternary ammonium salts include chlorides such as tetramethylammonium chloride, tetraethylammonium chloride, tetra-n-propylammonium chloride, benzyltrimethylammonium chloride, benzyltriethylammonium chloride and benzyltripropylammonium chloride; bromides such as tetramethylammonium bromide, tetraethylammonium bromide, tetra-n-propylammonium bromide, tetrabutylammonium bromide, benzyltrimethylammonium bromide, benzyltriethylammonium bromide and benzyltripropylammonium bromide; and iodides such as tetramethylammonium iodide, tetraethylammonium iodide, tetra-n-propylammonium iodide, benzyltrimethylammonium iodide, benzyltriethylammonium iodide and benzyltripropylammonium iodide. Among these, tetrabutylammonium bromide is preferred. The amount used of the phase transfer catalyst is preferably within a range from 0.001 to 10 mols, and more preferably from 0.01 to 1 mol, per 1 mol of the compound represented by formula (2). By using the phase transfer catalyst in an amount that satisfies the range, the target product can be obtained in good yield. [0042] By conducting the step Β2, the dihalogenated picoline derivative represented by formula (14) and/or the trihalogenated picoline derivative represented by formula (15) are converted to the monohalogenated picoline derivative represented by formula (3). As a result, the content ratio of the monohalogenated picoline derivative represented by formula (3) within the reaction system is increased, and isolation thereof becomes easy. [0043] Following completion of each of the reactions in the above steps Β1 and Β2, typical post-processing operations may be performed. The targeted monohalogenated picoline derivative represented by formula (3) can then be isolated. Further, if further purification of the product is necessary, then conventional purification methods such as distillation, extraction, recrystallization or column chromatography may be employed. The structure of the target product may be identified and confirmed by measuring the 'H-NMR spectrum, TR spectrum and mass spectrum, and by elemental analysis and the like.

[0074] The reaction between the halogenated picoline derivative represented by formula (7) and the tetrazolylhydroxyimino derivative represented by formula (8) in the step Cl is a conventional reaction that involves a coupling between a halogeno group and a hydroxyl group. The reaction may be performed, for example, in accordance with the method disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2003-137875 or International Patent Publication No. WO 03/016303 pamphlet. The reaction is generally performed in the presence of a base. [0075] Examples of the base used in the reaction include alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide; alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as magnesium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; carbonates such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate; hydrides such as sodium hydride and calcium hydride; metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide and magnesium methoxide; and organic bases such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaminopyridine, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene and l,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene. Any one of these bases may be used alone, or a combination of two or more bases may be used. The amount used of the base in the step Cl is typically within a range from 0.01 to 100 mols, and preferably from 0.1 to 5 mols, per 1 mol of the tetrazolylhydroxyimino derivative represented by formula (8). The reaction in the step Cl may be conducted in the presence of a solvent or without using a solvent. There are no particular limitations on the solvent used, provided it is inactive in the reaction. Examples of the solvent include hydrocarbon-based solvents such as pentane, hexane, heptane, benzene, toluene and xylene; halogen-based solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride; nitrile-based solvents such as acetonitrile and propionitrile; ether-based solvents such as diethyl ether, dioxane and tetrahydrofuran; amide-based solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, Ν,Νdimethylacetamide and N-methylpyrrolidone; sulfoxide-based solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide; and mixed solvents of the above solvents. [0077] There are no particular limitations on the procedure and the like adopted for the reaction between the halogenated picoline derivative represented by formula (7) and the tetrazolylhydroxyimino derivative represented by formula (8). For example, the reaction may be performed by adding a base and the tetrazolylhydroxyimino derivative represented by formula (8) to an organic solvent solution containing the halogenated picoline derivative represented by formula (7). The temperature during the period from the start of the reaction to the completion of the reaction in the step Cl may be either kept at a constant temperature or varied, but is typically within a range from -70°C to +200°C, and preferably from -20°C to +100°C. The reaction time varies depending on the reaction scale and the like, but is typically within a range from 30 minutes to 24 hours. [0078] By conducting the step Cl, a tetrazolyloxime derivative represented by formula (9) can be obtained in an industrially advantageous manner. The tetrazolyloxime derivative represented by formula (9) is a novel substance, and is very useful as a production intermediate for the tetrazolyloxime derivative represented by formula (10) described below. In formula (9), R1C, R2C, Ζ, m, A, ΐ¾ and Υ are the same as defined above in formula (7) or formula (8). [0079] [Step C2] Next, in the step C2, the tetrazolyloxime derivative represented by formula (10) may be obtained by treating the reaction product obtained in the step Cl with a base. The reaction product obtained in the step Cl, namely the tetrazolyloxime derivative represented by formula (9), may be reacted with a base without performing any purification operation of the reaction solution obtained in the step Cl, or alternatively, the reaction solution obtained in the step Cl may be subjected to a purification operation to isolate the reaction product, namely the tetrazolyloxime derivative represented by formula (9), which may then be treated with a base. Examples of the purification operation include distillation, recrystallization and column chromatography. [0080] There are no particular limitations on the base used in the step C2, provided it is capable of eliminating the R2C group from the tetrazolyloxime derivative represented by formula (9). Examples of the base include alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide; alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as magnesium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide; carbonates such as sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate; hydrides such as sodium hydride and calcium hydride; metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide and magnesium methoxide; and organic bases such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaminopyridine, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane,4-(dimethylamino)pyridine, l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene and l,5-diazabicyclo[4,3.0]non-5-ene. Any one of the bases may be used alone, or a combination of two or more bases may be used. The amount used of the base in the step C2 is typically within a range from 0.01 to 100 mols, and preferably from 0.1 to 5 mols, per 1 mol of the tetrazolyloxime derivative represented by formula (9). When the reaction solution obtained in the step Cl is used in the step C2 without removing the base therefrom, the amount of base added in the step C2 may be adjusted taking into account the amount used in the step Cl. [0081] The reaction in the step C2 may be conducted in the presence of a solvent or in the absence of a solvent. There are no particular limitations on the solvent used, provided it is inactive in the reaction. Specific examples of the solvent include the same solvents as those described above for the step Cl. If the solvent used in the step C2 is the same as the solvent used in the step Cl, there is no need to perform a solvent substitution when transitioning from the step Cl to the step C2, which is advantageous in terms of production costs. [0082] There are no particular limitations on the procedure and the like adopted for treating the reaction product obtained in the step Cl with a base. For example, the reaction may be performed by adding a base to an organic solvent solution containing the reaction product obtained in the step Cl, namely the tetrazolyloxime derivative represented by formula (9). The temperature during the period from the start of the reaction to the completion of the reaction in the step C2 may be either kept at a constant temperature or varied, but is typically within a range from 0°C to the boiling point of the solvent, and is preferably within a range from 10 to 60°C. The reaction time varies depending on the concentration of the base and the reaction scale and the like, but is typically within a range from 5 minutes to 24 hours, [0083] By performing the step C2, the tetrazolyloxime derivative represented by formula (10) can be obtained in an industrially advantageous manner. In formula (10), R1C, Ζ, m, A, nc and Υ are the same as defined above in formula (7) or formula (8). [0084] Following completion of the reaction of the step C2, typical post-processing operations may be performed. The targeted tetrazolyloxime derivative represented by formula (10) can then be isolated. Further, in those cases where further purification of the product is required, conventional purification methods such as distillation, extraction, recrystallization or column chromatography may be employed. The structure of the target product may be identified and confirmed by measuring the ^-NMR spectrum, 1R spectrum and mass spectrum, and by elemental analysis and the like. [0085] The tetrazolyloxime derivative represented by formula (10) obtained using the production method according to the present invention may be converted to a salt. The salt may be produced in accordance with normal methods, by treating the tetrazolyloxime derivative represented by formula (10) with an acid. [0086] The tetrazolyloxime derivative represented by formula (10) or a salt thereof, obtained using the production method according to the present invention, is ideal as an active ingredient of fungicides or the like. The fungicides may be used, for example, as agrochemical formulations that assist the growth of agricultural and horticultural crops, as antifouling agents that prevent the adhesion of crustaceans and shellfish, and as antibacterial and moldproofing reagents for walls and bathrooms, or shoes and clothing. EXAMPLES [0087] The present invention is described below in further detail based on a series of examples, but the present invention should not be interpreted as being limited to only these examples. (a) (b) [0089] 10,52 g (2,5 mmol) of a compound (a) was dissolved in 1,25 ml of toluene (0.5 L/mol). The solution of the compound (a) was then added dropwise, at room temperature, to a liquid prepared by adding 0.13 g of sodium hydride (55%) (1.2 eq.) to a mixture solvent composed of toluene and N,N-dimethylformamide at a ratio of 4/1 (2 L/mol), and the resulting mixture was then aged at room temperature for 30 minutes.

A solution containing 20.8 g of t-butyl (6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-carbamate in 50 ml of toluene was added dropwise to the suspension in the reactor over a period of 20 minutes and within a temperature range from 20°C to 25°C. Following completion of the dropwise addition, the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at a temperature within a range from 20°C to 25°C. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was cooled to 5°C or lower, and 13.9 ml of benzoyl chloride was added dropwise over a period of 15 minutes and within a temperature range from 0°C to 5°C. Following completion of the dropwise addition, the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at a temperature within a range from 0°C to 5°C. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was poured into 200 ml of ice water, and the organic layer and the aqueous layer were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with 20 ml of toluene, and the extract was mixed with the previously separated organic layer. The resultant was washed twice with 50 ml of water, and then washed once with 50 ml of a saturated saline solution. The solvent was removed by distillation under reduced pressure. Hexane was added to the residue, and the mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. 50 ml of hexane was further added to the residue, and the mixture was heated at 60°C. The mixture was then cooled gradually to 10°C, and stirred for 30 minutes at a temperature of 10°C or lower. The mixture was then filtered. The solid matter was washed twice with 20 ml of hexane, and then dried by heating, to obtain 29.1 g (93%) of a compound represented by formula (d). [0101] (Example Β2): Production oft-butyl benzoyl-(6-bromomethyl-pyridin-2-yI)-carbamate [0102] (e) [0103] First, 29.1 g oft-butyl benzoyl-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-carbamate was dissolved in 372 ml of chlorobenzene. To the resultant solution was added 7.8 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate. The resultant mixture was then heated to 90°C, and then 3.1 g of azobisisobutyronitrile was added thereto, followed by adding 26.6 g of l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin in 10 portions over a period of 80 minutes. Following completion of the addition, the mixture was stirred at 90°C for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature, washed with 140 ml of 1Ν sodium hydroxide, and then washed with a mixed solution composed of 70 ml of water and 23 ml of a saturated saline solution. The thus obtained organic layer was cooled at 5°C or lower, and then 14.9 g of a 50% solution of sodium hydroxide, 12.0 ml of diethyl phosphite and 1.5 g of tetrabutylammonium chloride were each added in portions, while the progression of the reaction was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography. Following completion of the additions, the mixture was stirred for 15 minutes at a temperature within a range from 0°C to 5°C. The disappearance of the spots corresponding with the dibromo compounds and the tribromo compound and the production of the compound represented by formula (e) (the monobromo compound) were confirmed by performing thin-layer chromatography. The reaction solution was directly used in example Β3 without subjecting to any post-processing. To the reaction solution obtained in the example Β2 was added 37.2 g of a 20% solution of sodium hydroxide, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at a temperature within a range from 20°C to 25°C. Subsequently, 18.9 g of (1 -methyl- 1Η-5-tetrazolyl)-phenyl-methanone-oxime was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 3.5 hours at a temperature within a range from 20°C to 25°C. The disappearance of the target substance and the production of a compound represented by formula (f) were confirmed by performing thin-layer chromatography. The reaction solution was directly used in example Β4 without subjecting to any post-processing.

The disappearance of the raw materials and the production of the target product were confirmed by performing thin-layer chromatography. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was separated into an organic layer and an aqueous layer. The organic layer was washed with 93 ml of 1Ν sodium hydroxide. The aqueous layer was extracted with 23 ml of chlorobenzene, and the extract was mixed with the previously separated organic layer, followed by washing the mixture with 47 ml of a saturated saline solution. The solvent was removed by distillation under recued pressure, and then methanol was added to the residue, followed by concentrating the mixture under reduced pressure. The process of adding methanol and performing concentration under reduced pressure was further repeated twice. Subsequently, 47 ml of methanol was added to the resultant, and the mixture was heated under reflux to obtain a homogenous solution. The solution was then cooled gradually to 10°C, and stirred for 30 minutes at a temperature of 10°C or lower. The resulting liquid was then filtered. The solid matter was washed twice with 19 ml of methanol, and then dried under heat, yielding 26.6 g of a compound represented by formula (g). The melting point of the solid material was 141.5 to 141.6°C. The through-yield from the t-butyl benzoyl-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-carbamate (example Β2) was 70%. [0108] (Example Β5): Production of t-butyl acetyl-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-carbamate With the exception of using acetyl chloride instead of benzoyl chloride, the same procedure as the production example Β1 was used to produce a compound represented by formula (h). The melting point of the compound was 77.4 to 77.5°C. [0110] (Example Β6): Production of t-butyl acetyl-(6-bromomethyI-pyridin-2-yl)-carbamate [0111] First, 1.05 g (4,2 mmol) of t-butyl acetyl-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-carbamate was dissolved in 17 ml of chlorobenzene (4 L/mol). 1,2 g (1 eq.) of l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin and 0.14 g (20 mol%) of 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile were added to the resulting solution, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 90°C for one hour. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was cooled, the precipitate was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated to approximately half volume. To the thus obtained residue were added, under cooling, 0.58 g of diethyl phosphite and 0.54 g of diisopropylethylamine, and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 19 hours. The disappearance of the raw materials was confirmed by performing thin-layer chromatography (ethyl acetate : hexane =1:4 (volumetric ratio)), and then the resultant was extracted with chloroform three times. The extract was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent was then removed by distillation under reduced pressure. (Example Β7): Production of t-butyl {6-([Z]-(l-methyl-lH-5-tetrazolyl)phenylmethylene-aminooxymethyl)-2-pyridyl} carbamate [0114] 0) First, 0.85 g of (l-methyl-lH-5-tetrazolyl)-phenyl-methanone-oxime was dissolved in 6 ml of chlorobenzene (1.5 L/mol). To the resulting solution were added dropwise, at 0°C, 1.75 ml (2 eq.) of a 20% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, 0,27 g (20 mol%) of tetrabutylammonium bromide, and a solution prepared by dissolving the residue obtained in the example Β6 in 3 ml of chlorobenzene (0.8 L/mol). The resulting mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. Following confirmation by performing thin-layer chromatography (ethyl acetate : hexane =1:4) that the raw materials had disappeared, the reaction mixture was extracted with chloroform three times. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent was then removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The residue was purified using an automated fraction collector (manufactured by Yamazen Corporation), yielding t-butyl acetyl-{6-([Z]-(l-methyI-lH-5-tetrazolyl)phenylmethylene-aminooxymethyl)-2-pyridyl} carbamate in a yield of 67.4%. Next, 1.28 g (2.835 mmol) of the thus obtained t-butyl acetyl-{6-([Z]-(l -methyl-1 H-5-tetrazolyl)phenylmethyIene~aminooxymethyl)-2-pyridyl}carbamate was dissolved in 23 ml of methanol (8 L/mol). To the resulting solution was added 3.51 ml (3 eq.) of a 10% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide, and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 hours. Subsequently, the reaction liquid was concentrated. The resulting concentrate was washed with water, washed with hexane, and then washed with a small amount of methanol. The product was then air-dried, yielding 0.98 g of the target compound (yield: 84.5%). The through-yield from the t-butyl acetyl-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-carbamate (example Β6) was 73.8%. [0116] (Example Β8): Production of t-butyl t-butoxycarbonyl-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)-carbamate [0117] ch3 00 First, 38 g of 6-methyl-pyridin-2-ylamine, 169 g of bis(t-butoxycarbonyl) oxide, 18 ml (2.48 g) of triethylamine and 18 ml (1.84 g) of pyridine were dissolved in 340 ml of dimethylformamide. The resulting solution was then heated gradually. The liquid temperature was eventually raised to 90°C while monitoring the state of generated carbon dioxide. The reaction mixture was then held at the temperature for 5 hours. Following confirmation by performing thin-layer chromatography that the raw materials had disappeared, the reaction mixture was poured into a mixed solution containing 500 ml of each of a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride, a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate and a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, and the resulting mixture was then extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract was then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. Subsequently, a column purification was performed, yielding 81 g (74.7%) of the target product. [0118] (Example Β9): Production of 2-bis(t-butoxycarbonyl)amino-6-bromomethyl-pyridine [0119] CH, (1) To 102.8 g (334 mmol) of t-butyl t-butoxycarbonyl-(6-methyl-pyridin-2-yl)carbamate were added 10.95 g (20 mol%) of 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile and 1,330 ml of chlorobenzene, To the resulting mixture was added 95.31 g of l,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin, and the temperature of the mixture was then raised to 90°C at a rate of 2°C/minute and held at the temperature for one hour. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was cooled to 20°C, the precipitate was filtered off, and the volume of chlorobenzene was reduced by half by distillation. The thus obtained residue was cooled to 10°C or lower, and then 46.03 g (43 ml) of di isopropyl ethyl amine and 43.08 g (58 ml) of diethyl phosphite were added thereto, followed by aging the mixture at room temperature for 16,5 hours. Following confirmation by performing thin-layer chromatography that the raw materials had disappeared, the reaction mixture was washed with 300 ml of 3 Ν hydrochloric acid, and then further washed with 500 ml of a saturated saline solution. The resulting solution was then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered, yielding a solution of 2-bis(t-butoxycarbonyl)amino-6-bromomethylpyridine. [0121] (Example Β10); Production of t-butyl {6-([Z]-(l-methyI-lH-5-tetrazolyl)phenylmethylene-aminooxymethyl)-2-pyridyl}carbamate [0122] To the solution of 2-bis(t-butoxycarbonyl)amino-6-bromomethyl-pyridine obtained in the example Β9 were added 67.7 g of (1-methyl-lH-5-tetrazoly1)-phenyl-methanone-oxime, 667 ml of a 1 Ν aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and 5.4 g (5 mol%) of tetrabutylammonium bromide, and the resulting mixture was aged at room temperature for two hours. Following confirmation by performing thin-layer chromatography that the raw materials had disappeared, 500 ml of water and 500 ml of chloroform were added, and an extraction was performed. The aqueous layer was extracted with 500 ml of chloroform, and then washed with 500 ml of water. The extract was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and then concentrated. The thus obtained residue was dissolved in 2.5 L of methanol, and 1 L of a 1 Ν aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was then added to the solution at room temperature. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for approximately 20 hours. The precipitated crystals were collected by filtration. The thus obtained crystals were washed three times with 500 ml of water, and then dried in a desiccator, yielding 98.16 g of the Z-isomer of the target product (purity: 98.5%, yield: 72.6%), On the other hand, 5 L of water was added to the above filtrate, and the mixture was extracted three times with 1,000 ml of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer was washed with 1 L of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and then concentrated. The thus obtained residue was purified using a fraction collector manufactured by Biotage ΑΒ, yielding 6.1 g of the target product (Ε:Ζ isomeric mixture). The total yield was 77.1%. [0124] (Example Cl) [0125] [Chemical Formula 27] To 54.7 g of a solution prepared by dissolving 5.87 g (15 mmol) of a compound represented by formula (η) in 44 mL of chlorobenzene were added 48.0 g (60 mmol) of an aqueous solution of NaOH having a concentration of 5% by weight, 0.24 g (0.75 mmol) of tetrabutylammonium bromide, and 3.77 g (purity: 97.0% by weight, 18 mmol) of a compound represented by formula (ο). The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours, and the disappearance of the compound represented by formula (η) and the production of a compound represented by formula (ρ) were confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography. [0126] The reaction mixture was heated to 40°C, and 4.29 g (30 mmol) of an aqueous solution of NaOH having a concentration of 28% by weight was added. The mixture was then stirred at 40°C for 2.5 hours. Subsequently, the mixture was left to stand overnight, and was then again stirred at 40°C for 3.5 hours. The reaction mixture was separated, and the thus obtained organic phase was washed sequentially with an aqueous solution of NaOH having a concentration of 1 mol/L and water. Following washing, the organic phase was concentrated using an evaporator, and the resulting residue was crystallized from methanol, yielding 6.08 g (14.8 mmol, yield: 99%) of white crystals. The obtained white crystals exhibited the same physical property values as the compound labeled as compound number (3)-8 in Table 3 of WO 03/016303. The obtained white crystals were confirmed as being the compound represented by formula (q)- [0127] (Example C2) [Chemical Formula 28] [0128] First, 0.47 g (1.28 mmol) of the compound represented by formula (η) was dissolved in 5 mL of acetonitrile, and then 0.2 g (1.4 mmol) of potassium carbonate was added thereto. Subsequently, 0.3 g (1.4 mmol) of the compound represented by formula (ο) was added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The mixture was then left to stand overnight. Next, the reaction mixture was filtered and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The thus obtained residue was purified by column chromatography, yielding 300 mg (0.58 mmol, yield: 46%) of white crystals. The NMR measurement results for the thus obtained white crystals were as follows. !H-NMR (CDC13, 5 ppm): 1.25 (s, 9Η), 3.87 (s, 3Η), 5.30 (s, 2Η), 7.21 to 7.81 (m, 13Η). The obtained white crystals were confirmed as being the compound represented by formula (ρ). [0129] (Example C3) With the exception of replacing the compound represented by formula (η) with 2-(t-butoxycarbonylmethoxycarbonylamino)-6-bromomethyl-pyridine, the same procedure as the example C2 yielded a compound represented by formula (r). The NMR measurement results for the compound represented by formula (r) were as follows.
