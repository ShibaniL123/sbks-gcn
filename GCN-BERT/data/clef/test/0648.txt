DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIGS. 1 through 6 thereof, a new livestock oiling device embodying the principles and concepts of an embodiment of the disclosure and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described. As best illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 6, the livestock oiling and scratching device 10 generally comprises a base 12 and a pole 14 coupled to the base 12. The pole 14 has a base end 16 and an upper end 18. A reservoir 20 is coupled to the pole 14 proximate the upper end 16. The reservoir 20 is configured for holding a fluid 22. The fluid 22 is of a conventional type used for treating livestock to deliver oil and/or insecticide to the livestock. A cable 24 is coupled to and extends between the pole 14 and the base 12. The cable 24 has a top section 26 and a bottom end 28. The cable 24 is constructed of a plurality of wound metal fibers 30 allowing the fluid 22 to permeate and pass through the cable 24. The top section 26 of the cable 24 is in fluid communication with the reservoir 20 wherein the cable is configured for is impregnated by the fluid 22. The cable 24 hangs between the pole 14 and the base 12 such that the cable 24 forms an arc 32 between the top section 26 of the cable 24 and the bottom end 28 of the cable 24. Each of a plurality of tubes 34 is provided. The cable 24 extends through each of the tubes 34. The cable 24 further extends through each of a plurality of discs 36. Each of the discs 36 is positioned between an associated adjacent pair of the tubes 34. Each of the discs 36 has a radius greater than a radius of each of the tubes 34 wherein a circumferential edge 38 of each disc 36 is positioned in outwardly spaced relationship to the associated adjacent pair of the tubes 34. The tubes 34 and the discs 36 cover the cable 24 from the top section 26 to the bottom end 28. Each of the discs 36 has a central aperture 40 having a diameter greater than an outer diameter 42 of the cable 24 wherein each disc 36 is pivotable into a skewed position relative to a longitudinal axis of the cable 24. Thus, the disc 36 urges the adjacent pair of tubes 34 apart defining a gap 44 between the adjacent pair of tubes 34 whereby each disc 36 is configured for facilitating dispensing of the fluid 22 through the gap 44 onto livestock rubbing against the discs 36. Each of the tubes 34 may be constructed of a wearable aluminum material such that each end 46 of the tube 34 wears to conform to angling between each end 46 of the tube 34 and a respective adjacently positioned one of the discs 36, as shown in FIG. 4. The angling of the ends 46 of the tubes 34 allows for collection of the fluid within the tubes 34 until the discs 36 are moved by livestock rubbing against the tubes 34 and discs 36 on the cable 24. An axle 48 may be coupled to the base 12. Each of a pair of wheels 50 is coupled to the axle 48 and a hitch 52 is coupled to the base 12 opposite the axle 48 wherein the base 12 is configured for being transported by a vehicle coupled to the hitch 52. A leg 54 is coupled to the base 12. The leg 54 is positioned between the axle 48 and the hitch 52. The leg 54 is extendable to support the base 12 with the wheels 50. An upper chain section 58 has a first end 60 coupled to the pole 14. The upper chain section 58 has a second end 62 coupled to the cable 24. A lower chain section 64 has a first end 66 coupled to the cable 24. The lower chain section 64 has a second end 68 coupled to the base 12. The upper chain section 58 and lower chain section 64 enhance durability of the device 10. A post 80 may be provided coupled to and extending upwardly from the base 12. The bottom end 28 of the cable 24, by way of the lower chain section 64, is coupled to the post 80. The pole 14 has a length greater than the post 80 wherein the cable 24 extends downwardly from the pole 14 to the post 80. A collar 70 is coupled to the upper section 26 of the cable 24 such that the cable 24 extends through the collar 70. An aperture 72 extends into the collar 70. A tube 74 has a top end 76 in fluid communication with the reservoir 20. The tube 74 has a bottom end 78 in fluid communication with the aperture 72 wherein the tube 74 is configured to deliver the fluid 22 from the reservoir 20 to the upper section 26 of the cable 24. In use, the device 10 functions similarly to a conventional livestock oiling apparatus. The discs 36 and tubes 34 provide pooling of the fluid 22, durability for the device 10, and the extension of the discs 36 from the tubes 34 provides a scratching effect such that the livestock are attracted to and readily utilize the device 10. With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure. Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure.
