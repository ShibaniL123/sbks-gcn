COMPOUNDS AND COMPOSITIONS AS TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 7 AGONISTS CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 ,987,314, filed 01 May 2014, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to compounds which are Toll-Like Receptor 7 (TLR7) agonists, compositions containing such compounds and methods of using such compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Early detection of specific classes of pathogens is accomplished by the innate immune system with the help of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The detected pathogens include viruses, bacteria, protozoa and fungi, and each constitutively expresses a set of class-specific, mutation-resistant molecules called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These molecular markers may be composed of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids or combinations thereof, and may be located internally or externally. Examples of PAMPs include bacterial carbohydrates (lipopolysaccharide or LPS, mannose), nucleic acids (bacterial or viral DNA or RNA), peptidoglycans and lipotechoic acids (from Gram positive bacteria), N- formylmethionine, lipoproteins and fungal glucans. Pattern recognition receptors have evolved to take advantage of three PAMP qualities. First, constitutive expression allows the host to detect the pathogen regardless of its life cycle stage. Second, the PAMPs are class specific, which allows the host to distinguish between pathogens and thereby tailor its response. Third, mutation resistance allows the host to recognize the pathogen regardless of its particular strain. Pattern recognition receptors are involved in more than just recognition of pathogens via their PAMPs. Once bound, pattern recognition receptors tend to cluster, recruit other extracellular and intracellular proteins to the complex, and initiate signaling cascades that ultimately impact transcription. Additionally, pattern recognition receptors are involved in activation of complement, coagulation, phagocytosis, inflammation, and apoptosis functions in response to pathogen detection. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) may be divided into endocytic PRRs or signaling PRRs. The signaling PRRs include the large families of membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasmic NOD-like receptors, while the endocytic PRRs promote the attachment, engulfment and destruction of microorganisms by phagocytes without relaying an intracellular signal, are found on all phagocytes and mediate removal of apoptotic cells. In addition, endocytic PRRs recognize carbohydrates and include mannose receptors of macrophages, glucan receptors present on all phagocytes and scavenger receptors that recognize charged ligands.

The terms "fibrosis" or "fibrosing disorder," as used herein, refers to conditions that follow acute or chronic inflammation and are associated with the abnormal accumulation of cells and/or collagen and include but are not limited to fibrosis of individual organs or tissues such as the heart, kidney, joints, lung, or skin, and includes such disorders as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis. The term "iatrogenic," as used herein, means a condition, disorder, or disease created or worsened by medical or surgical therapy. The term "immunologically effective amount," as used herein, means that the administration of a sufficient amount to an individual, either in a single dose or as part of a series, that is effective for treatment or prevention of an immunological disease or disorder. This amount varies depending upon the health and physical condition of the individual to be treated, age, the taxonomic group of individual to be treated (e.g. non-human primate, primate, etc.), the capacity of the individual's immune system to synthesize antibodies, the degree of protection desired, , the treating doctor's assessment of the medical situation, and other relevant factors. It is expected that the amount will fall in a relatively broad range that can be determined through routine trials. An "immunological response" or "immune response" to an antigen or composition, as used herein, refers to the development in a subject of a humoral and/or cellular immune response to the antigen or composition. Immune responses include innate and adaptive immune responses. Innate immune responses are fast-acting responses that provide a first line of defense for the immune system. In contrast, adaptive immunity uses selection and clonal expansion of immune cells having somatically rearranged receptor genes (e.g., T- and B-cell receptors) that recognize antigens from a given pathogen or disorder (e.g., a tumor), thereby providing specificity and immunological memory. Innate immune responses, among their many effects, lead to a rapid burst of inflammatory cytokines and activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages and dendritic cells. To distinguish pathogens from self-components, the innate immune system uses a variety of relatively invariable receptors that detect signatures from pathogens, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, or PAMPs. The mechanism behind this potentiation of the immune responses has been reported to involve pattern- recognition receptors (PRRs), which are differentially expressed on a variety of immune cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, B cells and some nonimmune cells such as epithelial and endothelial cells. Engagement of PRRs leads to the activation of some of these cells and their secretion of cytokines and chemokines, as well as maturation and migration of other cells. In tandem, this creates an inflammatory environment that leads to the establishment of the adaptive immune response. PRRs include nonphagocytic receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) proteins, and receptors that induce phagocytosis, such as scavenger receptors, mannose receptors and β-glucan receptors. Dendritic cells are recognized as some of the most important cell types for initiating the priming of naive CD4+ helper T (TH) cells and for inducing CD8+ T cell differentiation into killer cells. TLR signaling has been reported to play an important role in determining the quality of these helper T cell responses, for instance, with the nature of the TLR signal determining the specific type of TH response that is observed (e.g., TH1 versus TH2 response). A combination of antibody (humoral) and cellular immunity are produced as part of a TH1 -type response, whereas a TH2-type response is predominantly an antibody response. A "humoral immune response" refers to an immune response mediated by antibody molecules, while a "cellular immune response" refers to an immune response mediated by T- lymphocytes and/or other white blood cells. One important aspect of cellular immunity involves an antigen-specific response by cytolytic T-cells ("CTLs"). CTLs have specificity for peptide antigens that are presented in association with proteins encoded by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and expressed on the surfaces of cells. CTLs help induce and promote the intracellular destruction of intracellular microbes, or the lysis of cells infected with such microbes. Another aspect of cellular immunity involves an antigen-specific response by helper T-cells. Helper T-cells act to help stimulate the function, and focus the activity of, nonspecific effector cells against cells displaying peptide antigens in association with MHC molecules on their surface. A "cellular immune response" also refers to the production of cytokines, chemokines and other such molecules produced by activated T-cells and/or other white blood cells, including those derived from CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. The term "inflammatory disorders," as used herein, refers to those diseases or conditions that are characterized by one or more of the signs of pain (dolor, from the generation of noxious substances and the stimulation of nerves), heat (calor, from vasodilatation), redness (rubor, from vasodilatation and increased blood flow), swelling (tumor, from excessive inflow or restricted outflow of fluid), and loss of function (functio laesa, which may be partial or complete, temporary or permanent). Inflammation takes many forms and includes, but is not limited to, inflammation that is one or more of the following: acute, adhesive, atrophic, catarrhal, chronic, cirrhotic, diffuse, disseminated, exudative, fibrinous, fibrosing, focal, granulomatous, hyperplastic, hypertrophic, interstitial, metastatic, necrotic, obliterative, parenchymatous, plastic, productive, proliferous, pseudomembranous, purulent, sclerosing, seroplastic, serous, simple, specific, subacute, suppurative, toxic, traumatic, and/or ulcerative. Inflammatory disorders further include, without being limited to those affecting the blood vessels (polyarteritis, temporal arthritis); joints (arthritis: crystalline, osteo-, psoriatic, reactive, rheumatoid, Reiter's); gastrointestinal tract (Disease,); skin (dermatitis); or multiple organs and tissues (systemic lupus erythematosus).

Processes for Making Compounds of Formula (I) General procedures for preparing compounds of Formula (I), and subformulae thereof, are described in the Examples, infra. In the reactions described, reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, may be protected to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (see e.g., T.W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry," John Wiley and Sons, 1991 ). In certain embodiments, the compounds of Formula (I), and subformulae thereof, are prepared as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt by reacting the free base form of the compound of Formula (I), Formula (la) or Formula (lb) with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic acid or inorganic acid. In other embodiments, a pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt of compounds of Formula (I), Formula (la) or Formula (lb) is prepared by reacting the free acid form of the compound of Formula (I), Formula (la) or Formula (lb) with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic base or inorganic base. Alternatively, the salt forms of the compounds of Formula (I), Formula (la) or Formula (lb) are prepared using salts of the starting materials or intermediates. In certain embodiments, the compounds of Formula (I), Formula (la) or Formula (lb) are in the form of other salts including, but not limited to, oxalates and trifluoroacetates. In certain embodiments, hemisalts of acids and bases are formed, for example, hemisulphate and hemicalcium salts. Such pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of compounds of Formula (I), Formula (la) or Formula (lb) include, but are not limited to, a hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, succinate, maleate, formate, acetate, adipate, besylatye, bicarbonate/carbonate, propionate, fumarate, citrate, tartrate, lactate, benzoate, salicylate, glutamate, aspartate, p- toluenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, naphthalenesulfonate (e.g. 2-naphthalenesulfonate), hexanoate salt, bisulphate/sulphate, borate, camsylate, cyclamate, edisylate, esylate, gluceptate, gluconate, glucuronate, hexafluorophosphate, hibenzate, hydrochloride/chloride, hydrobromide/bromide, hydroiodide/iodide, isethionate, lactate, malate, malonate, mesylate, methylsulphate, naphthylate, 2-napsylate, nicotinate, orotate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, phosphate/hydrogen phosphate/dihydrogen phosphate, pyroglutamate, saccharate, stearate, tannate, tosylate, trifluoroacetate and xinofoate salts. The organic acid or inorganic acids used to form certain pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of compounds of Formula (I), Formula (la) or Formula (lb) include, but are not limited to, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, succinic, maleic, formic, acetic, propionic, fumaric, citric, tartaric, lactic, benzoic, salicylic, glutamic, aspartic, p-toluenesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic such as 2- naphthalenesulfonic, or hexanoic acid.

In certain embodiments, the free acid or free base forms of the compounds of Formula (I) are prepared from the corresponding base addition salt or acid addition salt from, respectively. For example a compound Formula (I), Formula (la) or Formula (lb) in an acid addition salt form is converted to the corresponding free base by treating with a suitable base (by way of example only, an ammonium hydroxide solution, a sodium hydroxide, and the like). For example, a compound of Formula (I), Formula (la) or Formula (lb) in a base addition salt form is converted to the corresponding free acid by treating with a suitable acid (by way of example only, hydrochloric acid). In certain embodiments, compounds of Formula (I), Formula (la) or Formula (lb) are prepared as protected derivatives using methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art. A detailed description of the techniques applicable to the creation of protecting groups and their removal can be found in T. W. Greene, "Protecting Groups in Organic Chemistry," 3rd edition, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 1999. In certain embodiments, compounds of Formula (I), Formula (la) and Formula (lb) are prepared as their individual stereoisomers. In other embodiments, the compounds of Formula (I), Formula (la) and Formula (lb) are prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure enantiomers. In certain embodiments, resolution of enantiomers is carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds of Formula (I), Formula (la) or Formula (lb), or by using dissociable complexes (e.g., crystalline diastereomeric salts). Diastereomers have distinct physical properties (e.g., melting points, boiling points, solubility, reactivity, etc.) and are readily separated by taking advantage of these dissimilarities. In certain embodiments, the diastereomers are separated by chromatography, or by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. The optically pure enantiomer is then recovered, along with the resolving agent, by any practical means that would not result in racemization. A more detailed description of the techniques applicable to the resolution of stereoisomers of compounds from their racemic mixture can be found in Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, "Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions," John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981 . A non-limiting example of a synthetic scheme used to make compounds of Formula (I) is illustrated in reaction scheme (I) below. Scheme (I) Scheme (I) illustrates the synthesis of pyrrolopyrimidines of Formula (I) using a two-step scheme starting with commercially available 4-chloro-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-2-amine. Alkylation at the N-5 position by a benzylbromide (or benzylchloride) analog gives the corresponding 5-benzyl derivatives, where R3 and R4 are as defined herein. Subsequent SNAr substitution of the chloro group by an alkyl amine derivative affords the corresponding 4,5- disubstituted pyrrolopyrimidine, where R is R6 or -CHR6R9 and R6 and R9 are as defined herein. Pharmacology and Utility When a foreign antigen challenges the immune system it responds by launching a protective response that is characterized by the coordinated interaction of both the innate and acquired immune systems. These two interdependent systems fulfill two mutually exclusive requirements: speed (contributed by the innate system) and specificity (contributed by the adaptive system). The innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against invading pathogens, holding the pathogen in check while the adaptive responses are matured. It is triggered within minutes of infection in an antigen-independent fashion, responding to broadly conserved patterns in the pathogens (though it is not non-specific, and can distinguish between self and pathogens). Crucially, it also generates the inflammatory and co-stimulatory milieu (sometimes referred to as the danger signal) that potentiates the adaptive immune system and steers (or polarizes it) towards the cellular or humoral responses most appropriate for combating the infectious agent. The development of TLR modulators for therapeutic targeting of innate immunity has been reviewed (see Nature Medicine, 2007, 13, 552-559; Drug Discovery Today: Therapeutic Stateoies. 2006, 3, 343-352 and Journal of Immunology. 2005, 174, 1259-1268). The adaptive response becomes effective over days or weeks, but ultimately provides the fine antigenic specificity required for complete elimination of the pathogen and the generation of immunologic memory. It is mediated principally by T and B cells that have undergone germline gene rearrangement and are characterized by specificity and long-lasting memory. However, it also involves the recruitment of elements of the innate immune system, including professional phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils etc.) and granulocytes (basophils, eosinophils etc.) that engulf bacteria and even relatively large protozoal parasites. Once an adaptive immune response has matured, subsequent exposure to the pathogen results in its rapid elimination due to highly specific memory cells have been generated that are rapidly activated upon subsequent exposure to their cognate antigen. Autoimmune diseases, are defined by (i) humoral or autoantibody response to a self antigen (by way of example only, Graves' primary hyperthyroidism with antibodies to the TSH receptor), or (ii) cellular response wherein immune cells destroy nonimmune cells from which the self-antigen is derived (by way of example only, the thyrocyte (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) or pancreatic -islet cell (Type 1 diabetes). Many autoimmune diseases are a combination of both phenomena, for instance, Hashimoto's and Type 1 diabetes also have auto-antibodies, antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) or anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)/lslet Cell. Autoimmune diseases often have an inflammatory component including, but not limited to, increases in adhesion molecules (by way of example only, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1 ), and altered leukocyte adhesion to the vasculature such as, by way of example only, colitis, systemic lupus, systemic sclerosis, and the vascular complications of diabetes. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are type-l transmembrane proteins characterized by an extracellular N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, followed by a cysteine-rich region, a TM domain, and an intracellular (cytoplasmic) tail that contains a conserved region named the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain. TLRs are pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that are expressed predominantly on immune cells including, but not limited to, dendritic cells, T lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes and natural killer cells. The LLR domain is important for ligand binding and associated signaling and is a common feature of PRRs. The TIR domain is important in protein-protein interactions and is associated with innate immunity. The TIR domain also unites a larger IL-1 RfTLR superfamily that is composed of three subgroups. Members of the first group possess immunoglobin domains in their extracellular regions and include IL-1 and IL-18 receptors and accessory proteins as well as ST2. The second group encompasses the TLRs. The third group includes intracellular adaptor proteins important for signaling. TLRs are a group of pattern recognition receptors which bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) from bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses, and act as a first line of defense against invading pathogens. TLRs are essential to induce expression of genes involved in inflammatory responses, and TLRs and the innate immune system are a critical step in the development of antigen-specific acquired immunity. Adaptive (humoral or cell-mediated) immunity is associated with the TLR signal mechanism of innate immunity. Innate immunity is a protective immune cell response that functions rapidly to fight environmental insults including, but not limited to, bacterial or viral agents. Adaptive immunity is a slower response, which involves differentiation and activation of naive T lymphocytes into T helper 1 (Th1 ) or T helper 2 (Th2) cell types. Th1 cells mainly promote cellular immunity, whereas Th2 cells mainly promote humoral immunity. Though primarily a host protective system, pathologic expression of the innate immunity signals emanating from the TLR pathway are implicated in initiating autoimmune-inflammatory diseases. All TLRs appear to function as either a homodimer or heterodimer in the recognition of a specific, or set of specific, molecular determinants present on pathogenic organisms including bacterial cell-surface lipopolysaccharides, lipoproteins, bacterial flagellin, DNA from both bacteria and viruses and viral RNA. The cellular response to TLR activation involves activation of one or more transcription factors, leading to the production and secretion of cytokines and co-stimulatory molecules such as interferons, TNF-, interleukins, MIP-1 and MCP-1 which contribute to the killing and clearance of the pathogenic invasion. TLR spatial expression is coincident with the host's environmental interface. While only a few other Toll-like proteins have been cloned in Drosophila, the human TLR family is composed of at least 1 1 members, TLR1 through TLR1 1 , that elicit overlapping yet distinct biological responses due to differences in cellular expression and signaling pathways they initiate. Each of the TLRs is expressed on a different subset of leukocytes and each of the TLRs is specific in its expression patterns and PAMP sensitivities and detects different subsets of pathogens allowing vigilant surveillance by the immune system. Toll-like Receptor 7 (TLR7) TLR7 maps to human chromosome Xp22, and the TLR7 sequence encodes a 1049 (aa) protein containing 27 N-terminal LRRs with a calculated molecular weight of 121 kDa. TLR7 is most closely related to TLR8 and TLR9 with 43% and 36% overall (aa) sequence identity, respectively. In vivo, TLR7 mRNA is expressed in lung, placenta, spleen, lymph node, and tonsil. TLR7 mRNA expression is highest in monocytes, B cells, and plasmocytoid dendritic cells. In vitro, TLR7 mRNA expression is upregulated in THP-1 cells upon PMA-induced differentiation. TLR7 is highly upregulated by exposure to IL-6 and to a slightly lesser extent by autocrine IFN-γ, IL- 1 β. TLR7 mRNA expression in THP-1 cells is elevated after exposure to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Ex vivo, expression of TLR7 is elevated after exposure to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in monocytes and to a greater degree in granulocytes. TLR7 is expressed in the endosome. The role of TLR7, is to detect the presence of "foreign" single-stranded RNA within a cell, as a means to respond to viral invasion. TLR7 is a structurally highly conserved protein which recognizes guanosine- or uridine-rich, single- stranded RNA (ssRNA) from viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza virus. Thus, through activation of dendritic cells and other antigen- presenting cells, TLR7 engagement and resulting cytokine production is expected to activate diverse innate and acquired immune response mechanisms leading to the destruction of pathogens, infected cells or tumor cells.

Another way of assessing the immunogenicity of the immunogenic compositions disclosed herein where the antigen is a protein is to express the proteins recombinantly for screening patient sera or mucosal secretions by immunoblot and/or microarrays. A positive reaction between the protein and the patient sample indicates that the patient has mounted an immune response to the protein in question. This method may also be used to identify immunodominant antigens and/or epitopes within protein antigens. The efficacy of the immunogenic compositions can also be determined in vivo by challenging appropriate animal models of the pathogen of interest infection. The immunogenic compositions disclosed herein will generally be administered directly to a subject. Direct delivery may be accomplished by parenteral injection (e.g., subcutaneously, intraperitoneal^, intravenously, intramuscularly, or to the interstitial space of a tissue), or mucosally, such as by rectal, oral (e.g., tablet, spray), vaginal, topical, transdermal or transcutaneous, intranasal, ocular, aural, pulmonary or other mucosal administration. The immunogenic compositions may be used to elicit systemic and/or mucosal immunity, preferably to elicit an enhanced systemic and/or mucosal immunity. Preferably the enhanced systemic and/or mucosal immunity is reflected in an enhanced TH1 and/or TH2 immune response. Preferably, the enhanced immune response includes an increase in the production of lgG1 and/or lgG2a and/or IgA.

At this point the ice-bath was removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 4 hours (if the reaction was not complete by this time additional LAH was added and stirring continued until the reaction was complete). The reaction mixture was then transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask, transferring with Et20. The mixture was cooled to 0 °C and vigorously stirred. The reaction was then quenched by the slow addition of ~5 ml_ of a saturated sodium sulfate solution. A white precipitate was then observed and the mixture was filtered through a frit containing Celite and washed with THF and Et20. The volatiles were then removed in vacuo and the material used in the next step without further purification. Step 3: tert-butyl 4-(3-((2-amino-4-chloro-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-dlpyrimidin-5-yl)methyl)-4- methoxybenzyl)piperazine-1 -carboxylate (5) Thionyl chloride (10 equiv.) was added to a round bottom flask containing (3-((2-amino-4- chloro-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)methyl)-4-methoxyphenyl)methanol (4, 1 equiv. from previous step) in DCM (0.1 M) at 0 °C. The ice-bath was then removed and the reaction mixture allowed to stir at room temperature for 4 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled back to 0 °C and slowly quenched by the addition of NaOH (1 M, 40 equiv.) and saturated NaHC03 (aq.). The material was transferred to a separatory funnel and washed with DCM 3x. The combined organic layers were dried with sodium sulfate, filtered and volatiles removed in vacuo. The resulting crude product was then dissolved in DMF (0.1 M) in a round bottom flask and used without further purification. To this material was added tert-butyl piperazine-1 - carboxylate (1 equiv.) and Huenig's base (1 .2 equiv.) and allowed to stir at room temperature for 18 hours. At this point the reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc, transferred to a separatory funnel and washed with saturated NaCI (aq.) 2x and water 2x. The combined organic layers were dried with sodium sulfate, filtered and volatiles removed in vacuo. The crude reaction mixture was purified by ISCO chromatography (0 - 10% MeOH:DCM, gradient) to afford tert-butyl 4-(3-((2-amino-4-chloro-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)methyl)-4- methoxybenzyl)piperazine-1 -carboxylate (5) as a solid.

The reaction mixture was heated to 120 °C and allowed to stir for 18 hours. At this point the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and water added. This mixture was then frozen and the majority of volatiles removed by lyophilization. The crude reaction mixture was purified by ISCO chromatography (0 - 10% MeOH (the MeOH contained 0.7 N NH3):DCM, gradient) to afford (S)-tert-butyl 4-(3-((2-amino-4-((1 -hydroxyhexan-2- yl)amino)-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)methyl)-4-methoxybenzyl)piperazine-1 -carboxylate (6) as a solid. Step 5: Example 1 - (S)-2-((2-amino-5-(2-methoxy-5-(piperazin-1 -ylmethyl)benzyl)-5H- pyrrolo[3,2-dlpyrimidin-4-yl)amino)hexan-1 -ol (30) HCI in dioxane (4 M, 20 equiv.) was added to a solution of (S)-tert-butyl 4-(3-((2-amino-4- ((1 -hydroxyhexan-2-yl)amino)-5H-pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)methyl)-4- methoxybenzyl)piperazine-1 -carboxylate (6, 1 equiv. from previous step) in DCM (0.1 M) in a round bottom flask at 0 °C. The ice-bath was then removed and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. At this point NH3 in MeOH (0.7 N) was added to the reaction mixture and the volatiles removed in vacuo. The addition of NH3 in MeOH (0.7 N) and removal of volatiles in vacuo was repeated two more times. The crude reaction mixture was then purified by ISCO chromatography (0 - 20% MeOH (the MeOH contained 0.7 N NH3):DCM, gradient) to provide (S)-2-((2-amino-5-(2-methoxy-5-(piperazin-1 -ylmethyl)benzyl)-5H- pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)hexan-1 -ol (30) as a solid: 1 H NMR (CD3OD) : δ 7.50 (d, 1 H), 7.29 (d, 1 H), 7.09 (d, 1 H), 6.54 (s, 1 H), 6.29 (d, 1 H), 5.69 (d, 1 H), 5.40 (d, 1 H), 4.37-4.31 (m, 1 H), 3.95 (s, 3H), 3.52-3.49 (m , 2H), 3.42 (s, 2H), 3.1 -2.3 (m, 8H), 1 .52-1 .1 6 (m, 4H), 1 .05-0.88 (m, 2H), 0.83 (s, 3H).

LRMS[M+1 ] = 355.2. Assays Compounds of Formula (I) were assayed to measure their capacity as toll-like receptor 7 agonists. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cell assay The bioactivity of the compounds of Formula (I) were tested in the human peripheral blood assay (human PBMC) using a panel of independent normal human donors according to approved guidelines by the institutional review committee. Human PBMC were isolated from freshly peripheral blood using a Ficoll density gradient (GE healthcare 17-1440-03). 30-35ml_s of peripheral human blood were layered onto 15ml_s of Ficoll in 50 ml conical tubes, followed by centrifugation at 1800 rpm (Eppendorf Centrifuge 581 OR with biohazard caps over the tube buckets) at room temperature for 30 minutes with no acceleration and no brake. The buffy layers were then collected and transferred onto new 50 ml conical tubes and washed twice in complete media consisting of RPMI 1640 (1 1875085 from Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, California) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco 10099-141 ), 1 % Pen-Strep (Gibco#15140-122), 1 mM non essential amino acids (Gibco#1 1 140-050), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco#1 1360-070), 2 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco#25030-081 ) and 1 mM HEPES (Gibco#15630-080). Viable cells were then counted using trypan blue staining, plated in 96 well flat bottom plates (Becton Dickinson #353070) at 2x105 cells per well in 200 I total volume of complete media. Compounds were then added in a 10 point dose response format starting at 100 μΜ, 3 fold dilution. Negative controls wells received equal concentration of DMSO. Culture supernatants were collected after 18-24 hours incubation at 37QC, 5% C02, stored at -20 °C until further use. IL-6 levels in the culture supernatants were measured using a Luminex kit (Biorad). Data analysis is performed using Prism software from GraphPad (San Diego, CA). Dose response curves are generated for each compound and EC50 values were determined as the concentration that gives 50% of the maximal signal. Reporter gene assay Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells were stably transfected with human TLR7 and an NF-kB-driven luciferase reporter vector (pNifty-Lucif erase). As a control assay, normal Hek293 transfected with pNifty-Luc were used. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% heart inactivated FBS, 1 % penicillin and streptomycin, 2 μg/ml puromycin (InvivoGen #ant-pr-5) and 5μg/ml of blasticidin (Invitrogen #46-1 120). Bright-Glo™ Luciferase assay buffer and substrate were supplied by Promega #E263B and #E264B (assay substrate and buffer respectively). 384 well clear-bottom plates were supplied by Greiner bio- one (#789163-G) and were custom bar-coded plates. Cells were plated at 25,000 cells/well in 384-well plates in a final volume of 50 μΙ of media. Cells were allowed to adhere to the plates after overnight (18 hours) culture at 37QC and 5% C02. Serially diluted experimental and positive control compounds were then dispensed to each well and incubated for 7 hours at 37QC and 5% C02. Cells stimulated with DMSO alone also serve as negative controls. After the incubation, 30 μΙ of the pre-mix assay buffer and substrate buffer were added to each well according to manufacturer's instructions. The luminescence signal was read on a CLIPR machine with an integration time of 20 seconds per plate. Dose response curves are generated for each compound and EC50 values were determined as the concentration that gives 50% of the maximal signal.
