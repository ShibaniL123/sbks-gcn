POLYISOIDIDE FURANOATE THERMOPLASTIC POLYESTERS AND COPOLYESTERS AND A USE THEREOF IN HOT FILL PACKAGING TECHNICAL FIELD [0001] The present invention relates generally to thermoplastics, and more particularly to thermoplastic polyesters and copolyesters. From another perspective, the present invention concerns polymers prepared from biobased monomers. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] A variety of high performance thermoplastic polymers are commercially produced from monomers of a non-biobased, non-renewable nature. Commercially desirable thermoplastic polymers used for packaging applications as well as for consumer electronics, in automotive and building and construction structural applications ideally have a high glass transition temperature (Tg) and a high molecular weight (MW), and are semi-crystalline in character so that the materials will have sufficient strength when used at high temperatures. Other desirable attributes further include high thermal stability and low color. [0003] Petrochemical examples of commercially valuable thermoplastics include polyethylene terephthalate (PET, with a Tg of 80°C, and a Tm of 260 °C), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT, having a Tg of 40°C, and a Tm of 220 °C) and bisphenol-A polycarbonate (PC, with a Tg of 150°C), though the polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate materials do not in fact have a sufficiently high glass transition temperature to be used in certain important packaging applications without modification, while bisphenol-A polycarbonate has a much higher glass transition temperature but implicates concerns related to the potential endocrine disrupting effects of bisphenol-A for food contact packaging. [0004] In this regard, hot fill packaging is a commercially important bottle packaging method in which the contents to be bottled are heated - up to typically at least 90 degrees Celsius - in order to sterilize the product prior to its being introduced into the bottle. Products packaged using hot fill technology include fruit juice, vegetable juices, flavored water and sports drinks. Hot fill is usually restricted to high-acid products with a pH of less than 4.5. [0005] Benefits of using hot fill packaging include sterilizing the interior of the packaging container, preventing the growth of microorganisms inside the container when packaged and extending the shelf life of the product, which usually ends up in the six to twelve month range. [0006] After filling, the container is cooled immediately to preserve the product's taste and its nutritional properties, which is paramount for fruit and vegetable products. [0007] While glass bottles have traditionally been used for hot filling, glass bottles are heavy, not durable and costly so that efforts have been made to use various polymers such as PET for hot filling; unfortunately, however, PET and PBT as noted above have glass transition temperatures below 90 degrees Celsius and so have hot-fill PET bottles have had to be specially made, for example, to include vertical ribs or to include panels that expand and contract during the heating and cooling involved in hot fill packaging to enable a PET container to maintain sufficient dimensional stability to be useful. These measures introduce product labeling complications and limitations on container design and branding that are undesirable. Further, PET and PBT are petroleum- based materials, and consequently have a greater greenhouse gas effect and are more costly to produce than is desirable. [0008] Functionally equivalent biobased polymeric materials have been increasingly sought in recent years as the manufacturing cost of conventional petroleum-based polymers has increased. Over the years various classes of rigid biobased, difunctional monomers have been developed from which high per- formance, biobased thermoplastic polyesters could be made, including 2,5- furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), acetalized aldaric acid and alditols, and isohexides. [0009] Of these materials, the isohexides are bicyclic, rigid diols that differ only in the orientation of the hydroxyl groups at C2 and C5. They can be ob- tained by cyclodehydration of the respective hexitols, i.e. isomannide (endo- endo) from mannitol, isosorbide (exo-endo) from sorbitol and isoidide (exo-exo) from iditol. [0010] Mainly due to the limited availability of isomannide and isoidide, most of the scientific and patent literature on isohexide polymers describes the effects of incorporation of isosorbide (which is commercially produced on a small scale). This literature has established that incorporating isosorbide in polyesters in general produces a significant increase in the Tg of the ensuing polymers, which could widen the scope of application of these materials. [0011] However, thus far several drawbacks have hampered the success- ful commercialization of isohexide based polymers. The secondary hydroxyl groups are less reactive than primary groups, resulting in lower reactivity, and hence require harsh (though industrially common) melt polymerization conditions in order to build up molecular weight. However, such conditions also lead to increased degradation and color formation. Furthermore, the presence of two hydroxyl groups with a different spatial orientation as in isosorbide leads to the formation of random, stereo-irregular polymers, which prohibits crystallization. [0012] Isoidide on the other hand has a symmetrical arrangement of the two hydroxyl groups, and efforts have been made previously to prepare polymers based on isoidide, though as noted previously these efforts have been lim- ited in extent because of isoidide's limited availability. [0013] Thiem and Liiders (Thiem et al., Polym. Bull, vol. 11, pp. 365-369 (Berlin, 1984); Thiem et al., Starch/Staerke, vol. 36, pp. 170-176 (1984)) were the first to report on the synthesis of polyisoidide terephthalate (PUT) by melt polymerization of the diol with terephthaloyl chloride (TDC) at 180 °C. The resulting polymer had a number average molecular weight Mn of 3,800 (by membrane osmometry), a Tg of 153 °C and a Tm of 192 °C. [0014] Later, Storbeck et al. (Storbeck et al., Makromol. Chem., col. 194, pp. 53-64 (1993)) prepared a semi-crystalline PUT by solution polymerization from the diol and TDC (toluene, pyridine, 100°C), reporting however a polymer with a significantly higher number average molecular weight Mn of 14,500 (by membrane osmometry), a Tg of 209 °C, and a Tm of 261 °C. [0015] Of greater relevance to the materials of the present invention, Storbeck and Ballauf also reported the synthesis and characterization of a polyester of isoidide and FDCA (Storbeck et al., Polymer, vol. 34, pp. 5003-5006 (1993)). This furanoate polyester was obtained by solution polymerization of the diol with the acid chloride of FDCA (tetrachloroethane, pyridine, 25°C) with a Mn of 21,500 (by membrane osmometry) and a Tg of 196 °C. Although wide an- gle x-ray scattering (WAXS) analysis suggested a degree (very low) of crystallinity, no Tm was reported. [0016] More recently, moreover, Gomes et al. (Gomes et al., /. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym. Chem., vol. 49, pp. 3759-3768 (2011)) reported the preparation of the same isoidide furanoate polyester by a slightly adapted procedure, and mentions nothing of any observed crystallinity; the isoidide furanoate polyester made by Gomes et al. had a number average molecular weight Mn of 5,650 and a Tg of 140 °C. [0017] Consequently, while the literature to date does demonstrate that polyisoidide terephthalate polyesters have been made which demonstrate the desired semi-crystalline nature, there appears to be no precedent for a fully biobased semi-crystalline polyisoiside furanoate by melt polymerization, using FDCA in place of purified terephthalic acid (PTA). Such materials would be highly desirable for providing a fully biobased alternative thermoplastic to current commercially available, petroleum-based thermoplastics such as PET and PBT, and particularly if these fully biobased, semicrystalline polymers were to possess sufficiently high glass transition temperatures to be used directly in hot fill packaging applications without the concessions that have had to be made in using conventional polyesters such as PET and PBT. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0018] The present invention in one aspect concerns such high molecular weight, semi-crystalline polyisoidide 2,5-furanoate (PIIF) homopolymers and copolymers. The homopolymers and copolymers of the invention are in particular obtainable by the method of making them according to the invention. [0019] In a particular embodiment, the invention is related to a copolyester of the invention employing a low level of a more volatile diol co- monomer in addition to the isoidide, particularly, wherein isoidide and 1,4- butanediol or 2,3-butanediol are used in about a 95:5 ratio by weight (of isoidide to butanediol) . [0020] The invention in another aspect pertains to a process for manufacturing a homopolyester according to the invention, comprising preparing a semi-crystalline polymer of isoidide and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid by melt polymerization, then performing solid state post condensation on the semi- crystalline polymer from melt polymerization. [0021] The invention in another aspect pertains also to a process for manufacturing a copolyester according to the invention, comprising preparing a semi-crystalline polymer of isoidide, one of 1,4-butanediol or 2,3-butanediol, and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid by melt polymerization, then performing solid state post condensation on the semi-crystalline polymer from melt polymeriza- tion. [0022] In another, related aspect, the invention concerns a process for manufacturing these materials by melt polymerization to provide a semi- crystalline material and subsequent solid state post condensation (SSPC). SSPC is performed at temperatures above the glass transition temperature but approximately 10 to 20 °C below the crystalline melting temperature Tm , which allows for molecular weight build-up under relatively mild conditions and avoids the harsh melt polymerization conditions previously evaluated for build- ing up molecular weight in isohexide polymers but which have been associated with increased degradation and color formation. [0023] In another aspect, the invention pertains to a process of manufacturing a polyisoidide furanoate polymer comprising the steps: performing a melt polymerization procedure wherein isoidide, dimethyl-2,5-FDCA and optionally another diol are provided and allowed to oligomerize at temperatures in the range of about 100-140°C; followed by treatment at elevated temperatures in the range of about 150 - 180°C for a sufficient time period, optionally further increasing the tem- perature to a level in the range of about 220-240 °C; reducing pressure and further elevate temperature to a range of about 220 to 260°C and subsequently performing a Solid State Post Condensation (SSPC) procedure. [0024] The invention in another aspect pertains to a wholly bioderived homopolyester or copolyester useful for hot fill packaging applications, having a glass transition temperature greater than 93 degrees Celsius. In one embodiment, the wholly bioderived homopolyester is a semi-crystalline polyisoidide 2,5-furanoate (PIIF) homopolymers according to the present invention. In an- other embodiment, the hot-fill packaging material is a semi-crystalline copolymer of isoidide, one of 1,4-butanediol or 2,3-butanediol, and 2,5- furandicarboxylic acid. [0025] The invention in another aspect pertains to a process for hot fill- packaging a food product, comprising heating the food product to a temperature in excess of 90 degrees Celsius, providing a container constructed from a wholly bioderived homopolyester or copolyester according to the present in- vention having a glass transition temperature greater than 93 degrees Celsius, filling the container with the hot food product, and sealing the container. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION [0026] The high molecular weight, semi-crystalline polyisoidide 2,5- furanoate (PIIF) homopolymers and copolymers of the present invention can be manufactured as described in the following. 1) Melt polymerization procedure [0027] Some of the melt polymerizations were conducted in suitable reaction vessels e.g. 100 mL three-neck round-bottomed flasks that were equipped with a stirring device, in particular a mechanical overhead stirrer and magnetic drive, gas inlet, e.g. nitrogen, and a-condenser, while others were conducted for example in a 250 ml glass flat flange reactor. In each melt polymerization, after charging the isoidide, dimethyl-2,5-FDCA and optional additional minor amounts of another diol where copolyesters were prepared, the set-up was placed under vacuum and purged with a protecting gas such as nitrogen. This cycle can be repeated as needed to generate the required amount of material. [0028] The melt polymerization step involved two stages. During the first stage, the reaction was typically carried out under protecting gas, such as nitrogen to form oligomers. The reaction mixture was heated to elevated temperature, e.g. about 100-140 °C, in particular about 120 °C for a sufficient time, e. g. about 5-30 min, in particular about 15 minutes preferably with constant stirring. After observing the melting, preferably the complete melting of the mixture, a suitable catalyst in a suitable amount, such as about 0.02 mol% (Ti(OiPr)4, in 2 mL of o-xylene) was added into the flask preferably under a protecting gas at- mosphere. The temperature was subsequently increased to about 150-180°C, in particular about 165 °C and stirring continued for about 10 to 30 h preferably about 16 hours. Finally the temperature was increased to from about 220 to 240°C, and maintained there under stirring for about 1 to 6 hours preferably about 4 hours to complete the first stage of the pre-polymerization reaction. The distillate was collected, preferably in a cooling flask. [0029] During the second stage of the melt polymerization to obtain higher molecular weight materials, reduced pressure was applied, preferably high vacuum of about 0.1 mbar gradually at about 220-260°C, preferably about 240 °C for about 1-5 hours, preferably about 3 hours. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool down, preferably to room temperature under a protecting gas atmosphere, and the crude polymer was removed from the reactor for example by using liquid nitrogen. The polymer was subsequently purified by dissolution in a suitable solvent, e.g. a chloro- form/TFA mixture and precipitation in a polar solvent such as methanol, optionally followed by filtration and vacuum drying. [0030] 2) Solid State Post Condensation (SSPC) procedure [0031] The polymer obtainable from the melt polymerization step were dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as HFIP, to provide a 10% polymer solu- tion, and additional catalyst, such as (Ti(OiPr)4, in sufficient amount was added with stirring. A respective sample and catalyst were allowed to air dry to evaporate in a comparable solvent, for example HFIP, and then the polymer sample with added catalyst was further dried, preferably in a vacuum oven. [0032] The thus-dried melt polymerized materials were then ground to a powder subjected to SSPC conditions (elevated temperature, vacuum) for specified times. The melt-polymerized samples prepared from the Batch A isoidide were done on a smaller scale, at 100 mg in a Kugelrohr oven, while materials from Batch B were done at a 15 g scale in the flat flange reactor, demonstrating the scalability of the technique. [0033] The high molecular weight, semi-crystalline polyisoidide 2,5- furanoate (PIIF) homopolymers and copolymers of the present invention, the suitability of these materials for hot-fill packaging applications in thermal property terms, and the manner in which these may be made are illustrated by the following, non-limiting examples: [0034] Examples [0035] A) Materials Listing: [0036] Isoidide used herein was generally prepared according to WO 2013/125950 Al to Hagberg et al. (hereby incorporated by reference herein), by subjecting an aqueous solution of isosorbide to epimerization in the presence of hydrogen under the influence of a catalyst comprising ruthenium on a support, preferably a carbon support. Three separate batches of isoidide were in fact prepared and used. These batches differed slightly in their manner of preparation and in their residual impurities, and while all three batches could be processed as described herein, testing of the materials made from the three batches did manifest some differences in the polymers made from each of the three independently-prepared batches, as detailed below. [0037] 2,5-FDCA dimethylester was prepared according to the procedure described in Knoop et al., /. Polym. Sci.Part A: Polym. Chem, vol. 51, pp. 4191- 4199 (2013), and recrystallized five times from methanol prior to use. [0038] A commercially available, technical grade isosorbide was recrystallized three times from ethyl acetate prior to use. [0039] The following additional chemicals were also used as described hereafter: 1,4-butanediol (> 99%, Sigma- Aldrich), 2,3-butanediol (>99%, Sigma- Aldrich), titanium(IV) isopropoxide (Ti(OiPr)4 , 97%, Sigma- Aldrich), o-xylene (anhydrous, 97%, Sigma- Aldrich), trifluoroacetic acid (99%, Sigma- Aldrich), l,l,l,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (or HFIP, Apollo Scientific Ltd, 99%), chloroform (Merck, p. a.), methanol (Merck, p. a.) and chloroform-d (99.8 atom% D, Sigma- Aldrich). All chemicals were used as received, unless denoted otherwise. [0040] B) Description of Sample Testing Apparatus and Methods: [0041] DSC: Differential Scanning Calorimetry measurements were conducted on a PerkinElmer Diamond® series calorimeter (PerkinElmer, Inc., Wal- tham, MA). The temperature range used was 0°C up to 300°C at a heating rate and cooling rate of 10 °C/minute. [0042] TGA: The thermal stability of the polyesters and copolyesters was determined by thermogravimetric analysis with an STA 6000 (Simultaneous Thermal Analyser) from PerkinElmer. The samples were heated from 30 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/ minute under a nitrogen flow of 40 mL/ minute. [0043] GPC: Molecular weights of the polyesters and copolyesters were determined by gel permeation chromatography on a Viscotek HP-SEC system (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, United Kingdom), including a VE-2001 GPCmax pump and auto sampler equipped with a TDA305 Triple Detector Array (Right Angle Light Scattering (RALS) + Low Angle Light Scattering (LALS), Refractive Index (RI) Detector and Viscometer), and a 2X GPC column PSS PFG analytical linear M and guard column, molecular range ~250 - 2.5*106 D (PMMA in HFIP). Data were calculated with OmniSEC™, Version 4.6 software. Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) containing 0.02 M potassium trifluoroacetate was used as the eluent with a flow rate of 0.7 ml/minute. Calibration of the measurements was done with PMMA standards (Easy vial PMMA standards from Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). [0044] WAXS: Wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) powder diffracto- grams were recorded on a Philips PC-APD diffractometer in the reflection geometry in the angular range 4-40° (2Θ), with a step size of 0.02° (2Θ) and an acquisition time of 1.0 s per step. The Cu Kal radiation from the anode, generated at 40 kV and 30 mA, was monochromatized using a 15 μηι Ni foil (λ = 0.1542 nm). The diffractometer was equipped with a 1° divergence slit, a 0.2 mm receiving slit, and a 1° scatter slit. [0045] NMR: Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer operating at 400.17 MHz (1H) and 100.62 MHz (13C). CDC (99.8 atom % D, Aldrich) was stored on dried molecular sieves 4A. [0046] U/vis: Samples (ranging from 2.5 mg/ml to lOmg/ml) were measured on a Shimadzu UV-1650PC spectrophotometer, in the same manner as described in WO 2010077133 Al . The cell temperature was set at 20°C using a Shimadzu CPS-controller. The absorbance at 5 mg/ ml was calculated from the corresponding calibration curve. [0047] C) Synthesis of Polyisoidide Furanoate Homopolymer and Copolymer Samples: [0048] 1) Melt polymerization procedure [0049] Some of the melt polymerizations were conducted in 100 mL three-neck round-bottomed flasks that were equipped with a mechanical overhead stirrer and magnetic drive, nitrogen inlet and Liebig-condenser, while others were conducted in a 250 ml glass flat flange reactor. In each melt polymerization, after charging the isoidide (or isosorbide for a comparative example), dimethyl-2,5-FDCA and optional additional minor amounts of another diol where copolyesters were prepared, the set-up was placed under vacuum and purged with nitrogen, and this cycle was repeated as needed to generate at least 15 grams of material [0050] The melt polymerization step involved two stages. During the first stage, the reaction was carried out under nitrogen to form oligomers. The reaction mixture was heated to 120 °C for 15 minutes with constant stirring. After observing the complete melting of the mixture, the catalyst (Ti(OiPr)4, 0.02 mol%, in 2 mL of o-xylene) was added into the flask under a continuous flow of nitrogen. The temperature was subsequently increased to 165 °C and stirring continued for 16 hours. Finally the temperature was increased to from 220 to 240°C, and maintained there under stirring for 4 hours to complete the first stage of the pre-polymerization reaction. The distillate was collected in a cooling flask. [0051] During the second stage of the melt polymerization to obtain higher molecular weight materials, high vacuum of 0.1 mbar was applied gradually at 240 °C for 3 hours. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool down to room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the crude polymer was removed from the reactor using liquid nitrogen. The polymer was subsequently purified by dissolution in 100 mL of a chlo- roform/TFA mixture (6:1) and precipitation in 1000 mL of methanol, followed by filtration and vacuum drying at 40 °C for 12 hours. [0052] The crude and precipitated polymers from the melt polymerization step were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and UV/vis spectroscopy, with the results shown in Table 1 and described below in the Results and Discussion section.

A respective sample and catalyst were allowed to air dry to evaporate HFIP, and then the polymer sample with added catalyst was further dried in a vacuum oven (40 °C, 100 mbar) over Sicapent® phosphorus pentoxide drying agent (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). [0055] The thus-dried melt polymerized materials were then ground to a powder with a mortar and pestle, and subjected to SSPC (50 ml round bottom flask) conditions (elevated temperature, vacuum) for specified times. The melt- polymerized samples prepared from the Batch A isoidide were done on a smaller scale, at 100 mg in a Kugelrohr oven, while materials from Batch B were done at a 15 g scale in the flat flange reactor, demonstrating the scalability of the technique. [0056] Samples were analysed by DSC and GPC, with the results shown in Table 2 and discussed further hereafter.

Analysis of the crude PIIF homopolyester showed that only relatively low molecular weight oligomer was formed (having an Mn of 1,500, corresponding to 5 repeating units). After precipitation of the crude polymer, the Mn value doubled, while the polydispersity index (PDI) improved to 1.7. Despite its low molecular weight, the oligomer already displayed a Tg of 111 °C. Since the ob- served Tm was 240 °C, melt polymerization was also attempted at this temperature in order to prevent premature solidification. Unfortunately no significant increase in molecular weight was achieved, while also the crude polymer showed no signs of crystallinity after cooling down from the melt. A reference polyester prepared from isosorbide and 2,5-FDCA dimethylester showed a comparable molecular weight and a somewhat lower Tg. As expected, this isosorbide-based reference polyester was fully amorphous. [0059] Based upon the results obtained, however, at a 220 degrees Celsius melt polymerization temperature in making a PIIF homopolymer, and keeping in mind that the subsequent SSPC of a semi-crystalline material from a melt polymerization step would involve a transesterification and subsequent expulsion of a diol, two copolyesters with a low level of incorporation of a more volatile diol than isoidide were also prepared by melt polymerization and can be compared to the PIIF homopolymers prepared at 220 degrees and 240 degrees and to the PISF reference polymer. [0060] The copolyester from the melt polymerization procedure with 5% added 1,4-butanediol (b.p. 235 °C) was also semi-crystalline in nature, having characteristics comparable to those of PIIF. 1,4-BDO was chosen as an additional, more volatile diol component based on its boiling point and the possibility to retain crystallinity due to the same number of carbon atoms between the hy- droxyl groups in the diol. A copolyester from the melt polymerization procedure with 5% added 2,3-butanediol (boiling point of 177 deg. C) was likewise semi-crystalline and displayed a high Tg. These examples demonstrate that small amounts of an added, more volatile diol co-monomer can be used in the melt polymerization step for improving the efficiency of the subsequent SSPC step, while still retaining a semi-crystalline character needed for the SSPC step. [0061] Referring now to the several materials made by SSPC after the melt polymerization step and to Table 2, it will be observed that SSPC (at 230 °C) of the PIIF homopolyester which had been prepared by melt polymerization at 220 degrees gave a five-fold increase in Mn, with a low PDI value of 2.2. Furthermore, as expected, both Tg and Tm are observed to have increased. Increasing the SSPC reaction time to 16 hours resulted in a further, yet less dramatic increase in Mn for the PIIF homopolyester. Extending the reaction to 40 hours proved to be detrimental, as is clear from the drop in Mn as well as the increase in the PDI. Increasing the SSPC temperature by only 10 °C accelerated the reaction, given the increase in Mn to almost 17,000 in only 2 hours. This effect appears to be lost over time, however, given the almost identical values obtained after 16 hours. [0062] Incorporation of small amounts of the more volatile diol 2,3-BDO proved beneficial. Because 2,3-BDO is more volative than isoidide, SSPC could be carried out at a lower temperature of 220 °C, with a considerable increase in Mn after 16 hours. Extending the reaction time to 40 hours also proved to be detrimental with the copolyester, however, as is clear from the drop in Mn even at the lower SSPC process temperature of 220 °C. Comparison of the homo- and co-polyester prepared by SSPC at 230 degrees Celsius for 16 hours showed an almost 20% further increase in Mn in the copolyester as compared to the homopolyester. 1.
