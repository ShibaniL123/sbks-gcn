ACCESSORY FOR FURNITURE Cross-Reference to Related Applications This application is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. Patent Application No. 14/465,353, entitled "Accessories for Classroom Furniture," filed August 21, 2014, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/993,737, filed on May 15, 2014, the entirety of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference; this application also claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/158,996, entitled "Accessories for Classroom Furniture," filed on May 8, 2015, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to an accessory for furniture, such as, on desks, tables, chairs, and other classroom furniture. Background of the Invention Teachers often require students to sit at their desks for extended periods of time. However, students need to move throughout the day and often feel frustrated when they are trapped at their desk for hours at a time and expected to "sit still, be quiet, and complete their work." Students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) sometimes get in trouble at school because they need ways to channel their hyperactive energy, but do not know what to do other than lean back in their chairs, fiddle with items in their desks, move around the room, etc. Similarly, students with learning disabilities sometimes get frustrated easily when working, especially when reading and writing. Their increased anxiety and frustration can quickly escalate to low performance and high discipline problems. Students with shorter legs (e.g., students whose feet may not reach the floor when sitting at their desks) may not like their feet dangling or may get in trouble for sitting on their feet in their chair. Students with Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) need a way to move without distracting others. Much research show how students with Asperger's Syndrome, autism, social anxiety disorder, and other conditions benefit strongly from having sensory relief from motor stimulation. Many occupational therapists have used different resources for providing such relief. It would be desirable to develop a way to make school a more pleasant experience for students who have high energy, high anxiety, or short legs, or who otherwise have difficulty sitting still for extended periods of time.

Rather, the embodiments merely provide non-limiting examples of various methods and systems that are at least included within the scope of the invention. The description is to be read from the perspective of one of ordinary skill in the art; therefore, information well known to the skilled artisan is not necessarily included. As used herein, "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents, unless expressly and unequivocally disclaimed. The present invention relates generally to accessories for use with furniture items. Such furniture items have at least two legs (typically, two to four legs). While embodiments of the present invention are generally described in connection with their usage with classroom desks, it should be understood that such accessories can likewise be used or adapted for use with tables, chairs, and other furniture, including those items typically used in classrooms and other learning environments. Additionally, while embodiments of the present invention are generally described in connection with their usage in classrooms, it should be understood that such accessories may be used in contexts outside of the classroom, such as in offices, restaurants, vehicles (e.g., planes, trains, and automobiles), religious institutions (e.g., churches and synagogues), and/or other environments. References to classroom furniture accessories and classroom furniture items are used herein for simplicity and consistency, and are not intended to limit the accessories of the present disclosure to particular uses with specific types or classes of furniture. Embodiments of accessories of the present invention can provide a number of advantages. For example, in some embodiments, the accessories can provide a way for students to stretch their legs and bounce while they think (e.g., help the students relax so they can focus/think more). As another example, furniture accessories, in various embodiments, can allow students to move while making minimal noise, without distracting other students, and/or without interfering with a teacher's instruction. Some embodiments of furniture accessories of the present invention can provide comfort to some students whose feet may not be able to reach the floor but may be able to rest them on the furniture accessory. In general, embodiments of furniture accessories of the present invention can assist a variety of students having different needs by providing a level of stimulation to the students in an acceptable way without distracting other students or their teacher. In some embodiments, a furniture accessory comprises two supports and an elastic cord comprising two ends, wherein each support is configured to surround at least a portion of a leg of the furniture and wherein each end of the elastic cord is configured to be coupled to a leg of the furniture above the support on that leg. In some embodiments, an accessory for a furniture item having at least two legs comprises at least two supports wherein each support is configured to surround at least a portion of a leg of an item of furniture, and an elastic cord comprising two ends, wherein a first end is configured to be coupled to a first leg of the item above a first support and wherein a second end is configured to be coupled to a second leg of the item above a second support. Each support can comprise a hollow tube or similar hollow structure in some embodiments. In some embodiments, an accessory for a furniture item having at least two legs comprises at least two hollow tubes wherein each tube has a length of at least six inches and wherein each tube is configured to surround at least a portion of a leg of an item of furniture, and an elastic cord comprising two ends, wherein a first end is configured to be coupled to a first leg of the item above a first hollow tube and wherein a second end is configured to be coupled to a second leg of the item above a second hollow tube. In some embodiments, an accessory for a furniture item having at least two legs comprises at least two circular hollow tubes wherein each tube has a length of at least six inches, wherein each tube has a diameter of at least 1.25 inches, and wherein each tube is configured to surround at least a portion of a leg of an item of classroom furniture, and an elastic cord comprising two ends, wherein a first end comprises a first loop configured to slide over a first leg of the item and wherein a second end comprises a second loop configured to slide over a second leg of the item. As indicated above, in some embodiments, each support comprises a hollow tube or other hollow structure. In such embodiments, the hollow tube or similar structure can slide over the leg to surround at least a portion of the leg. While the support may be referred to herein as a "hollow tube," it should be understood that the term "tube" is not intended to limit the support to structures having only round cross-sections and that the term "tube" should be understood to include supports with square, rectangular, triangular, oval, hexagonal, octagonal, pentagonal, or other cross-sections. Some furniture styles may have a crossbar, a lengthy base, or other structure that make it difficult or impossible to position a hollow tube onto the leg of the furniture. To accommodate such situations, in some embodiments, the support can comprise at least one hinge or similar structure, as discussed in more detail below, to permit the support to open enough to fit around the leg. As indicated above, each end of the elastic cord can be coupled to a leg of the furniture item above the support on that leg. In other words, the support can help maintain the elastic cord at a desired height on the leg by preventing it from sliding down the leg. As discussed below, the elastic cord can be constructed from a variety of elastic materials. In some embodiments, each end of the elastic cord comprises a loop configured to slide over the leg of the furniture item. In some embodiments, the elastic cord can be coupled to the legs of the furniture item by securing each end of the elastic cord to a leg of the furniture item with a fastener. An end of the elastic cord, in some embodiments, can be secured to the leg of the furniture item by tying the end to the leg. Referring now to the Figures, FIG. 1 illustrates the components of one embodiment of an accessory for a furniture item of the present invention. FIG. 1 shows an example of a support 10 and an elastic cord 15. As shown in FIGS. 2-5, such an embodiment of an accessory 5 for a furniture item can comprise two such supports 10 with the elastic cord 15. As shown in the Figures, the supports 10 are designed to permit desk legs 20 (e.g., for a classroom desk) to slide inside such that each support 10 surrounds at least a portion of the leg 20. In the embodiments shown, the supports 10 are hollow cylinders. As noted above, in other embodiments, the supports can be hollow tubes having other cross-sections such as square, rectangular, triangular, oval, hexagonal, octagonal, pentagonal, or others. The supports can be constructed from a number of materials including, without limitation, pipe formed from PVC or other plastics, bamboo, and other materials. In selecting a material to use for the support, one should consider whether the material will provide enough rigidity to withstand the stretching/relaxing of the elastic cord when a user exercises their legs using the elastic cord. In other words, the material used for the support, in some embodiments, should be rigid enough to maintain the elastic cord at a desired height above the floor so that a person sitting on or near the furniture can reach the elastic cord with his or her feet. As to the height or length of the supports, persons of ordinary skill in the art can select an appropriate height depending on any number of factors including, without limitation, the size of the furniture, the height of the furniture, the typical size of the user of the furniture, the furniture to which the accessory is to be attached, the elasticity of the elastic cord, and other factors. For example, for a desk or chair in an elementary school classroom, the supports, in some embodiments, can be less than 12 inches long. In some embodiments for use with desks and chairs in elementary school classrooms, the supports can have a length of about eight inches. The supports, in some embodiments, can have a length of at least six inches. The diameter of the supports (or width depending on the cross-sectional shape) can be a variety of sizes depending, for example, on the size of the legs of the classroom furniture items upon which the supports will be placed. In some embodiments, the diameter of the supports is greater than about 1.25 inches. The diameter of the supports in some embodiments is less than 5 inches. In some embodiments, the diameter of the supports is between about 1.25 inches and about 5 inches. The diameter of the supports is between about 1.25 inches and about 4 inches in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the diameter of the supports is between about 1.25 and about 2 inches. The diameter of the supports is about 1.5 inches in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the diameter of the supports is between about 1.5 inches and about 4 inches. Depending on the material used to construct the supports and how the supports are constructed, in some embodiments, the edges of the supports may be rounded or otherwise tapered to eliminate sharp edges. The rounding or tapering of these edges can prevent friction or abrasion when the elastic cord is positioned against the edges during use. For example, sharp edges could cause significant wear or tears on the elastic cord over time. In some embodiments, the inside edges of the supports can also be rounded or otherwise tapered. For example, the rounding or tapering of the inside edges can help prevent injuries that might occur if a student were to insert his or her fingers or toes inside the support. Supports can be formed using techniques known to those of skill in the art. In some embodiments, supports can be formed by cutting ten to twenty foot long PVC pipes into eight inch pieces using a miter saw with an extra fine tooth blade. The edges can be rounded or tapered using routing, sanding, grinding, or other techniques known to those of skill in the art. In some embodiments, the edges can be formed or molded to have a substantially rounded shape. In some embodiments, the interior of the housing of the support may rattle against or otherwise impact the leg 20 of the furniture item (or another portion of the furniture item) as the user interacts with the elastic cord 15, generating noise. The noise can be distracting, particularly in a classroom setting or other learning environment. Thus, in some embodiments, the interior of the support 10 may comprise one or more materials configured to reduce (e.g., dampen) sound generated by the support 10 impacting the furniture item. For example, the interior of the support 10 may comprise foam, a weather strip, rubber, a spacer, and/or another material positioned between an inner housing of the support 10 and the furniture item (e.g., the leg 20). The material may dampen vibrations resulting from an impact between the support 10 and the furniture item, reducing associated noise. As shown in the various Figures, the supports 10 can accommodate a variety of desk styles. For example, FIG. 3 shows the supports 10 on a desk where the desk has lower legs 25 that screw into upper legs 20. To install the supports 10, the lower legs 25 can be unscrewed from the upper legs 20 to permit the supports 10 to be slid over the lower legs 25. In the embodiments shown in FIGS. 2, 4, and 5, the supports 10 slide directly over the legs 20. Some furniture accessories may have a crossbar, a lengthy base, or other structure that make it difficult or impossible to slide a support onto the leg of the furniture. To accommodate such situations, in some embodiments, a support can comprise at least one hinge or similar structure to permit the support to open enough to fit around the leg. An example of such a desk is shown in FIG. 6 where the supports 30 are not able to be installed by sliding them over the legs 40. In this embodiment, each support 30 is provided with two hinges 45 to permit the supports 30 to open and fit around the legs 40. In some such embodiments, any hinge known to those of skill in the art can be used. Various factors can be important in selecting the hinge including the material from which the support is constructed, the length of the support, the width or diameter of the support, the thickness of the support, and others. Persons of ordinary skill in the art can identify other ways to permit the supports to open to fit around legs of furniture accessories in other embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, only one hinge or two hinges may be used per support, while in other embodiments three or more hinges can be used. In some embodiments, a support may be constructed from a material that is flexible to permit the support to open wide enough to fit around a furniture leg simply by cutting along the length of the support (the support may be resilient enough to open to fit around the leg and then close back when released). In some embodiments, hook-and-loop type fasteners (e.g., Velcro), or other fasteners may be used to facilitate opening and closing the supports for installation on furniture legs. In some embodiments, a promotional label or a piece of tape may be used to facilitate opening and closing the supports for installation on furniture legs. In addition to desks, classroom furniture accessories of the present invention can also be used on other types of furniture items. For example, FIGS. 7 and 8 show certain embodiments of classroom furniture accessories installed on chairs. In these embodiments, the supports 10 can slide over the chair legs 50,55 with the elastic cord 15 positioned on the supports 10. The classroom furniture accessories can be used in the same manner as when used on desks. As previously indicated, various embodiments of the present invention can also be installed on other types of furniture items such as tables, desk/chair combinations (see, for example, FIG. 4), etc. As discussed above, each end of the elastic cord 15 can be coupled to a leg 20 of the furniture above the support 10 on that leg 20. In other words, the supports 10 can help maintain the elastic cord 15 at a desired height above the floor (see, for example, "H" in FIG. 5) by preventing it from sliding down the leg 20. The elastic cord can be constructed from a variety of elastic materials. In some embodiments, the elastic cord 15 can be constructed from rubber rope (similar to bungee cord). One non-limiting example of a rubber rope that can be used to form an elastic cord in some embodiments is a solid core rubber rope having a diameter of 7/16 of an inch and which is commercially available from a number of sources (e.g., item no. RR438X from Pacific Cargo Corporation). In other embodiments, the elastic cord 15 can be constructed from an inner tube for a bicycle tire, from a multi-strand bungee cord, or from similar materials. A number of factors can be important in selecting the material for the elastic cord 15. In various embodiments, the material should have enough resistance to require some effort for the person to extend it, should have enough elasticity to return to its nominal unstretched length when not in use, should be durable enough to withstand repetitive usage, should be somewhat resistant to tearing (e.g., due to contact with the user's shoes, repetitive contact with the supports, etc.), etc. Another factor in selecting an elastic cord for use in some embodiments is color; it may be desirable to use an elastic cord having a particular color or a variety of colors. The length of the elastic cord 15 can vary depending on the furniture item on which the accessory is to be installed. In general, the elastic cord should have a length to extend between the two legs upon which the supports are installed with minimal, if any, stretching of the elastic cord. For example, if the elastic cord is too long, it may not provide adequate resistance to the person at a desk seeking to use the accessory. If the elastic cord is too short, it may put constant tension on the two legs (pull them toward one another) which could cause damage to the furniture. The elastic cord 15 can be coupled to the furniture legs 20 in a number of ways. In FIGS. 1, 3-8, each end of the elastic cord 15 (35) comprises a loop configured to slide over the leg 20,40,50 of the furniture. In FIG. 6, the loops at each end of the elastic cord 35 are formed using clamps 37. In such embodiments, the loops can optionally be formed around the legs as compared to embodiments where the loops are formed first and then slid over the furniture legs. In FIG. 2, each end of the elastic cord 15 is coupled to the legs 20 of the furniture by securing each end of the elastic cord to a leg. Elastic cords can be coupled to furniture legs in other ways known to those of skill in the art. In some embodiments, the elastic cord comprises a plurality of beads, protrusions (e.g., generally spherically-shaped protrusions), or similar items. The beads, protrusions, or similar items can be threaded onto, molded or formed into, or otherwise coupled to the elastic cord. In some embodiments, a protrusion comprises an area of expanded circumference (e.g., a circumference that is larger than the circumference of the elastic cord) that is molded or otherwise formed into the elastic cord. The beads or protrusions can be rounded and smooth in some embodiments. The beads can comprise a hole to permit them to slide onto the elastic cord during manufacture or assembly of the elastic cord in some embodiments. In some embodiments, the beads or protrusions can be of a size and shape such that the beads or protrusions comfort and/or massage the student or user's feet. Beads can be made from wood, plastic, rubber, foam, and any other materials that provide added relief and/or stimulation to the user. Beads or protrusions may be round, oval, ribbed, grooved, cubical, pyramidal, or any other shape that provides added relief and/or stimulation. Beads or protrusions can have a size between about 0.25 inches and three inches. Spacers may be provided on the elastic cord between the beads, in some embodiments, to prevent the beads from touching one another. In some embodiments, the beads are threaded onto the elastic cord without spacers. In embodiments where spacers are used, the spacers may have a length between about 0.5 inches and about two inches to keep the beads separated by at least that distance. In some embodiments, the elastic cord may comprise beads or protrusions having multiple sizes to potentially provide even more relief, pleasure, or stimulation for the user. FIG. 9 illustrates usage of one embodiment of an accessory for a furniture item of the present invention. As is evident from FIG. 9 and the FIGS. 2-8, accessories for furniture items can be utilized in multiple ways. In some embodiments, the accessories can function as an adaptable footrest. In some embodiments, the elastic cord and the supports can be attached to the two front legs of a student desk for students to stretch their legs, rest or bounce their feet while they work. In some embodiments, the elastic cord and the supports can be attached to the front two legs of a student's chair for similar results. The supports advantageously prevent the elastic cord from sliding down to the floor. Further, the supports assist in keeping the elastic cord at the optimum height for comfort and use. In some embodiments, the supports can be formed from a white material (e.g., PVC pipe), which can advantageously permit students or other users to decorate and/or personalize the supports using markers, paints, stickers, and similar supplies. Supports can also be manufactured in different colors for students to have options that match their preference. The colors for the support pipes include: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, pink, purple, black, white, and they are not limited to these colors. Some embodiments of the present invention relate to portable accessories that can provide similar benefits to the accessories for furniture described herein without being positioned on a piece of furniture. Such accessories can permit the same types of movement as the accessories for furniture items (e.g., classroom furniture items) described herein without being coupled to a desk, chair, or other furniture item. Such portable accessories are independent of a furniture item and thus can be used in a wide variety of locations including offices, homes, and schools. For example, an adult could position such a portable accessory under his or her desk and move his or her legs while seated at the desk. In general, such portable accessories comprise a stand having two side structures with the elastic cord extending between the two side structures. In some embodiments, a portable leg movement accessory comprises a stand wherein the stand comprises two side structures connected by a horizontal structure, and an elastic cord comprising two ends, wherein a first end is configured to be coupled to a first side structure and wherein a second end is configured to be coupled to a second side structure. Each side structure, in some embodiments, can comprise a notch, hole, groove or similar structure to receive an end of the elastic cord. Each side structure, in some embodiments, can comprise a plurality of notches, holes, grooves, or similar structures such that the elastic cord can be placed in different locations depending on the height of the chair that a user is sitting in, the length of a user's legs, or other factors. In some embodiments, each end of the elastic cord can comprise a knot, knob, disk, ferrule, or similar structure to hold the ends in the corresponding notches, holes, or other structure in the side structures. FIGS. 10-14 illustrate one embodiment of a portable leg movement accessory 100 according to the present invention. The portable accessory comprises a stand 105 with two side structures 110. In the embodiment shown, two horizontal structures 1 15 connect the side structures 1 10, although in other embodiments, there may only be a single horizontal structure connecting the side structures. In the embodiment shown, the stand 105 is designed in a way that permits it to collapse into a more compact arrangement for transport. For example, the stand can be assembled with grommets for hinging, slots that hold and insert the upright pieces, and tabs to secure positioning, as well as other techniques that will be apparent to those of skill in the art. In some such embodiments, the horizontal structure(s) and side structures are separate components, although it should be understood that a single unitary stand can be formed having one or more horizontal structures and side structures. In some embodiments, the stand does not collapse, fold, or otherwise change configuration. Regardless, the stand can still be portable whether it is designed to collapse into a smaller volume or not. The stand can be constructed from a variety of materials known to those of skill in the art including, for example, aluminum, steel, wood, and plastic. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 10-14, the side structures 115 have a generally semi-circular shape and are provided with a plurality of notches 120. The semi-circular shape of the side structures 115 and the plurality of notches 120 facilitate placement of an elastic cord at different locations on the stand (e.g., different heights). However, persons of skill in the art will recognize that side structures having other shapes can also be used. Examples of such shapes include square, rectangular, triangular and others. Where desired, such shapes can also be provided with notches, grooves, or holes to similarly permit positioning of an elastic cord at different locations. While notches 120 are shown in FIGS. 10-14, other structures can be provided in the side structures 110 to facilitate connection with an elastic cord. For example, in some embodiments, holes can be provided in the side structures. As with the other accessories for furniture items, an elastic cord 125 extends between the two side structures 1 10 in the portable accessory shown in FIGS. 10-14. The elastic cord 125 comprises two ends, wherein a first end 130 is configured to be coupled to a first side structure 110 and wherein a second end 135 is configured to be coupled to a second side structure 1 10. The elastic cord 125 can be coupled to the side structures 1 10 in a variety of ways. In the embodiment shown, each end 130,135 of the elastic cord 125 is provided with a stop collar 140. When the ends 130, 135 of the elastic cord 125 are positioned in the notches 120, the stop collars 140 hold the elastic cord 125 in the notches 120. The stop collar 140 also facilitates moving the elastic cord 125 to other notches 120 on the side structures 110 to, for example, adjust the height of the elastic cord. As another example, instead of a stop collar, an item with a shape similar to a rivet can be provided on each end of the elastic cord 125. The rivet-like item can have a top portion with a diameter that is wider than the notch 120 in the side structure 110. A hollow cylindrical portion can extend from the top portion of the rivet-like item and, in some embodiments, can fit within the notch 120 (or groove or hole). In this manner, the hollow cylindrical portion facilitates placement of the end of the elastic cord 125 in the notch 120, and the top portion with the wider diameter helps hold the end of the elastic cord 125 in the notch 120. The elastic cord can be secured within the hollow cylindrical portion by crimping the cylindrical portion around it, using glue, or other techniques. The elastic cord can also be secured within the hollow cylindrical portion by driving a rivet, screw or similar structure through the wall of the hollow cylindrical portion and into the elastic cord. Persons of ordinary skill in the art can identify other structures that can be used as alternatives to stop collars and rivet-like items. Rather than using a different structure, in some embodiments, the ends 130,135 of the elastic cord 125 can be provided with knots to secure the elastic cord 125 in the notches 120. Knots might also be useful when the side structures are provided with holes. Each end of the elastic cord can comprise a knot, knob, stop collar, rivet-like item or similar structure to hold the ends in the corresponding notches, holes, or other structure in the side structures. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 13-14, a plurality of beads 145 are threaded on the elastic cord 125. The beads 145 are of a size and shape such that the beads comfort and/or massage the student or user's feet. While not shown in the other Figures, it should be understood that such beads can similarly be provided on the elastic cords in those embodiments. Other portable embodiments may also be possible. For example, referring to FIG. 20, some embodiments may comprise an elastic cord 15 with two ends. Each end may comprise a respective attachment device 402, 404 configured to permanently or removably couple a respective end of the elastic cord 15 to a furniture item. The attachment devices 402, 404 may be of the same type or may be different. In some embodiments, an attachment device 402, 404 comprises a clamp (e.g., a cable clamp), hook, bolt, screw, loop, fastener, tape, glue, and/or any other suitable device for attaching the ends of the elastic cord 15 to one or more portions of a furniture item. For example, the attachment devices 402, 404 may comprise cable clamps configured to secure either end of the elastic cord 15 to respective legs of a chair, desk, or other furniture item. Some embodiments may allow a user to easily transport the accessory for use in a variety of contexts, such as in doctors' offices, restaurants, while traveling in a vehicle, and/or in other locations. FIG. 15 illustrates an elastic cord 15 for an accessory for a furniture item according to one embodiment of the present invention. The elastic cord 15 may comprise any suitable material, such as rubber. The elastic cord 15 can include two ends, each end comprising a hole 200 configured to fit around a leg of the classroom furniture item. In the embodiment shown, the holes 200 are formed into the ends of the elastic cord 15 via, for example, a molding process. In this embodiments, the diameter of the holes 200 is fixed. A longitudinal length of the elastic cord 15 can include a rounded shape, a flat shape, or any other suitable shape. In some embodiments, the length of the elastic cord 15 can be between 13 inches long and 20 inches long (e.g., 17 inches long). In some embodiments, the elastic cord 15 comprises an information block 202. The information block 202 can be positioned substantially in the longitudinal center of the elastic cord 15. In some embodiments, the information block 202 includes a height of at least one inch and/or a thickness of at least a half of an inch. The information block 202 can be configured to provide a user of the accessory with information about the accessory, such as usage instructions, a logo, a website, a manufacturer, a company name, and/or other information associated with the accessory. FIGS. 16-17 illustrate an accessory for a furniture item according to one embodiment of the present invention installed on a chair. In the embodiment shown, the accessory comprises an elastic cord 15 wrapped around a leg 20 of the furniture item. A support 212 can be positioned below the elastic band 15 and around the leg 20 of the furniture item to position the elastic cord 15 at a particular height. In some embodiments, the support 212 can include a hole 210. The hole 210 may comprise any cross-sectional shape, such as a circular shape, square shape, rectangular shape, or triangular shape. The embodiment shown also includes a fastening device 206 with two ends used to fasten the elastic cord 15 to the support 212. Examples of the fastening device 206 may comprise a string, a rope (e.g., l/8th inch graded nylon rope), or a zip tie. The ends of the fastening device 206 may be wrapped around the elastic cord 15, passed through the hole 210, and secured within an inner diameter of the support 212 (e.g., so that the ends are not easily removed from the hole 210). The fastening device 206 may be secured within the inner diameter of the support 212 with tape, a bolt, by tying a knot with the ends of the fastening device that is large enough that the knot cannot fit through the hole 210, or via any other suitable means. In some embodiments, the fastening device 206 can prevent the support 212 from coming loose and/or falling off a leg 20 of the furniture item (e.g., due to gravitational forces) if the furniture item is lifted off the ground, such as to be stacked upon another furniture item (e.g., FIG 17). Other methods for securing the support 212 to the elastic cord 15 to the support 212 may additionally or alternatively be used. For example, the elastic cord 15 can be glued, stapled, nailed, taped, locked (e.g., via a locking mechanism configured to enclose a portion of the elastic cord 15), attached by a fastener with interlocking surfaces (e.g., Velcro®), or otherwise affixed to a top portion of the support 212 (e.g., subsequent to the elastic cord 15 and support 212 being positioned on the classroom furniture item). FIGS. 18-19 illustrate an alternate support 300 for an accessory for a furniture item according to one embodiment of the present invention. The support 300 may comprise any of the features described herein with respect to supports. The support 300 comprises a longitudinal length L. In some embodiments, the longitudinal length L comprises at least four inches. The support 300 also comprises at least two sides 302, 304. The side 302, 305 comprise a wall thickness T. In some embodiments, the wall thickness T comprises at least 0.138 inches. In some embodiments, each side 302, 304 of the support 300 comprises a substantially semi-circular shape cross-sectional end shape (e.g., as shown in greater detail in FIG. 19). The sides 302, 304 may be coupled to one another via one or more hinges 45 and/or other flexible or bendable members. The hinges 45 and/or other flexible or bendable members may be configured to allow the support 300 to open and close, such as to fit around a leg of a furniture item (e.g., as described with respect to FIG. 6). In some embodiments, the support 300 comprises a locking mechanism configured to prevent the support 300 from opening. For example, the locking mechanism may comprise a latch 306 with a distal end protruding from the wall of side 304 and configured to engage with a recessed area 308 in the wall of side 302. As another example, the locking mechanism may comprise tape (positioned over the interface between the sides 302, 304), a screw, a nail, a staple, a sticker (e.g., a BouncyBands® sticker), etc. In some embodiments, the support 300 comprises an alignment mechanism configured to keep the sides 302, 304 of the support 300 substantially aligned with one another. For example, the alignment mechanism may comprise a ball 310 (e.g., a half- sphere), cylinder, pin, or other device with a distal end protruding from the wall of side 304 and configured to engage with a recessed area 312 in the wall of side 302. The recessed area 312 may comprise a spherical shape or dome shape, a cylindrical shape, or other shape for receiving the ball 310. In some embodiments, the alignment mechanism can help ensure that gravitational and other forces acting on the support 300 do not cause the sides 302, 304 of the support 300 to shift out of alignment. In some embodiments, the support 300 comprises a groove or recessed portion 314 traversing an outer circumference of the support 300. For example, the sides 302, 304 may comprise recessed portions 314 molded or milled into the respective outer surfaces of the sides 302, 304. The recessed portion 314 can be positioned near a longitudinal end (e.g., the top 316) of the support 300. In some embodiments, the recessed portion 314 is configured to receive an opening of an elastic cord (e.g., hole 200 of elastic cord 15). For example, the recessed portion 314 may be sized such that the opening of the elastic cord fits snugly around the recessed portion 314. The walls 318, 320 of the recessed portion 314 can fix the elastic cord in position or otherwise prevent the elastic cord from moving along the longitudinal length L of the support 300. In some embodiments, a wall 318 of the recessed portion 314 comprises a lip 322 configured to further prevent the elastic cord from moving along the longitudinal length L of the support 300. In some embodiments, the support 300 may additionally or alternatively comprise the hole (e.g., the hole 210 shown in FIG. 16) for receiving a fastening device (e.g., fastening device 206 of FIG. 16) configured to secure the support 300 to an elastic cord (e.g., elastic cord 15 of FIG. 16). In some embodiments, the support 300 may additionally or alternatively comprise one or more internal materials configured to reduce (e.g., dampen) sound generated by the support 300 impacting the furniture item, as discussed herein. For example, the interior of the sides 302, 304 of the support 300 may comprise foam, a weather strip, rubber, a spacer, and/or another material configured to dampen vibrations resulting from an impact between the support 300 and a furniture item, reducing associated noise.
