Step 3
N-(1-(3-(benzyloxy)-4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine
The crude 1-(3-(benzyloxy)-4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-amine 16c (3.1 g, 0.012 mmol), 2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate 1b (4.02 g, 0.018 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (3.1 g, 0.024 mmol) were dissolved in 30 mL of 1,4-dioxane. The resulting mixture was warmed up to 90Â°C. After stirring for 12 hours, the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound N-(1-(3-(benzyloxy)-4-fluorophenyl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine 16d (1.3 g, yield 30%) as a yellow liquid.
