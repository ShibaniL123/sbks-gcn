Technical Field The present invention relates to an anti-human ADAM28 antibody, and pharmaceutical use thereof. Background Art ADAM proteins (a disintegrin and metalloproteinases) are multifunctional proteins involved in the ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins, cell adhesion and infiltration (non-patent documents 1, 2). The human genome contains 25 ADAMs including four pseudogenes and 21 kinds of ADAMs are composed of 13 kinds of proteolytic ADAMs that exhibit proteolytic activity and eight kinds of non-proteolytic ADAMs (non-patent documents 1, 3). Proteolytic ADAMs share the metalloproteinase domain of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and a typical proteolytic ADAM protein comprises propeptide, metalloproteinase, disintegrin-like, cysteine-rich, epidermal growth factor-like, transmembranes and cytoplasmic domains (non-patent documents 3-9). Many proteolytic ADAMs, including ADAM8, ADAM9, ADAM12, ADAM15, ADAM17, ADAM19 and ADAM28 are overexpressed in human cancers and are associated with tumor growth and progression (non-patent documents 5, 9). The present inventors' previous studies have indicated that ADAM28 (also known as ADAM metallopeptidase domain 28), which has two alternative isoforms, including a prototype membrane-anchored form (ADAM28m) and a short secreted form (ADAM28s) (non-patent documents 5, 10, 11), is abundantly expressed in human non-small cell lung and breast carcinomas (non-patent documents 12, 13). By in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, the present inventors have demonstrated that ADAM28 is expressed predominantly in carcinoma cells contained in carcinoma tissues and that the mRNA expression levels of ADAM28 are associated with the cellular proliferation of breast cancer (non-patent document 13) and with both cancer cell proliferation and infiltration in non-small cell lung cancer (non-patent document 12). In a parallel study, the present inventors showed that serum ADAM27 levels in non-small cell lung cancer patients substantially increase with the progression of tumor, lymph node metastasis, and cancer recurrence (non-patent document 14). These data imply that ADAM28 is involved in cell proliferation and metastasis particularly in human cancer. The present inventors have demonstrated that ADAM28 contributes to cancer cell proliferation through enhanced bioavailability of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) by selective digestion of IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) of IGF-I/IGFBP-3 complex (non-patent document 13), and to angiogenesis by digestion of connective tissue growth factor in breast cancer (non-patent document 15). The phage display method is one of the display techniques that have realized a in vitro high-speed selection by forming a one-to-one correspondence in the form of phage particles between a functional peptide or protein and a DNA encoding same. This phage display method has been applied to antibody selection, and many antibodies obtained by this method have been developed as medicaments (non-patent document 16). Furthermore, a method of obtaining a specific antibody by combining a human artificial antibody library and a phage display method has also been established, and such methods have been practicalized by plural companies, as evidenced by HuCAL (Human Combinatorial Antibody Library) of MorphoSys.

Description of Embodiments The present invention provides an antibody having a specific binding activity to human ADAM28, and an activity to inhibit enzyme activity of human ADAM28. ADAM28 is a known protein, and the amino acid sequence thereof and the cDNA sequence thereof are also known. ADAM28 includes two kinds of a prototype membrane-anchored form (ADAM28m) and a short secretion form (ADAM28s), both of which are encompassed in ADAM28 in the present invention. A representative amino acid sequence of human ADAM28m is shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, a representative cDNA sequence of human ADAM28m is shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, a representative amino acid sequence of human ADAM28s is shown in SEQ ID NO: 4, and a representative cDNA sequence of human ADAM28s is shown in SEQ ID NO: 3. The antibody of the present invention has a specific binding activity to human ADAM28. The "human ADAM28" means that the amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence of ADAM28 has the same or substantially the same amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence as the amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence of ADAM28 naturally expressed in human. Being "substantially the same" means that the amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence of interest has not less than 70% (preferably not less than 80%, more preferably not less than 90%, more preferably not less than 95%, most preferably not less than 99%), identity with the amino acid sequence or nucleotide sequence of ADAM28 naturally expressed in human, and has the function of human ADAM28. Terms for biological species other than human, proteins other than ADAM28, gene and fragments thereof are also interpreted in the same manner. The "specific binding" of an antibody to antigen X means that the binding affinity of an antibody to antigen X in an antigen-antibody reaction is higher than the binding affinity to a non-specific antigen (e.g., bovine serum albumin (BSA)). The antibody of the present invention has an activity to inhibit the enzymatic activity of human ADAM28. The enzyme activity of human ADAM28 specifically means an activity of human ADAM28 to cleave human IGFBP-3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3). The activity of human ADAM28 to cleave human IGFBP-3 can be evaluated by, for example, the zymography analysis described in Cancer Res 2006; 66(20):9913-9920. In the present specification, the "antibody" is used as one encompassing a full-length antibody and any antigen-binding fragment (i.e., "antigen-binding portion") thereof or a single chain thereof. The "antibody" refers to a glycoprotein containing at least two heavy chains (H) and two light chains (L), which are linked by a disulfide bond, or an antigen-binding portion thereof. Each heavy chain is constituted by a heavy chain variable region (to be abbreviated as VH herein) and a heavy chain constant region. The heavy chain constant region is constituted by 3 domains of CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain is constituted by a light chain variable region (to be abbreviated as VL herein) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is constituted by a single domain CL. VH and VL regions are further subdivided into regions with higher variability called complementarity determining regions (CDRs), which contain more highly conservative regions called framework regions (FRs) scattered therein. Each VH and VL is constituted by 3 CDRs and 4 FRs, which are aligned in the following order, i.e., FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, FR4 from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus. The variable regions of said heavy chain and light chain contain binding domains that interact with an antigen. The constant region of an antibody can mediate the binding of immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells (e.g., effector cells) of the immune system and the first component (C1q) of the conventional complement system. In the present specification, the "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody is used to refer to one or more fragments of an antibody retaining an ability to specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., human ADAM28). It has been clarified that the antigen binding function of an antibody is performed by a fragment of a full-length antibody. Examples of the binding fragment included in the term "antigen binding portion" of an antibody include (i) Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment constituted by VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains, (ii) F(ab')2 fragment, a divalent fragment containing two Fab fragments linked by disulfide bond in the hinge region, (iii) Fab' fragment, an inherent Fab having a hinge region portion (see FUNDAMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY, Paul ed., 3. sup. rd ed. 1993), (iv) Fd fragment constituted by VH and CH1 domains, (v) Fv fragment constituted by VL and VH domains in a single arm of an antibody, (vi) dAb fragment constituted by VH domain (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), (vii) isolated complementarity determining region (CDR) and (viii) nanobody which is a heavy chain variable region containing single variable domain and two constant regions. While VL and VH, which are the two domains of Fv fragment, are encoded by different genes, they can be linked by a synthetic linker to produce a single protein chain from them by recombinant techniques, wherein, in this chain, VL and VH regions pair with each other to form a monovalent molecule (known as a single chain Fv (scFv); see, for example, Bird et al. (1988) Science 242: 423-426; and Huston et al., (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85: 5879-5883). Such single chain antibody is also encompassed in the "antigen-binding portion" of an antibody. Such antibody fragments are obtained by those of ordinary skill in the art by known conventional techniques, and screened for usefulness in the same manner as with unmodified antibody. The antibody of the present invention is preferably a monoclonal antibody. The "monoclonal antibody" refers to a preparation of an antibody molecule of a single molecule composition. The monoclonal antibody composition shows single binding-specificity and affinity for a particular epitope. The antibody of the present invention is preferably a human antibody or humanized antibody. The "human antibody" refers to an antibody having variable regions derived from a human germline immunoglobulin sequence in both the framework and CDR regions. Furthermore, when an antibody contains a constant region, the constant region also derives from a human germline immunoglobulin sequence. In the present specification, the "human antibody" also encompasses even an embodiment including an amino acid residue not encoded by a human germline immunoglobulin sequence (e.g., mutation introduced by random or site-directed mutagenesis in vitro or somatic mutation in vivo). In the present specification, in addition, the term of the "humanized antibody" means an antibody wherein a CDR sequence derived from the germline of an animal species other than human, such as mouse, is fused on the human framework sequence. In the present specification, the human antibody encompasses a "reconstituted human antibody". The reconstituted human antibody refers to a modified antibody wherein at least one CDR contained in the first human donor antibody is used in the second human acceptor antibody, instead of CDR of the second human acceptor antibody. Preferably, all 6 CDRs are substituted. More preferably, the whole antigen binding region (e.g., Fv, Fab or F(ab')2) of the first human donor antibody is used instead of the corresponding region in the second human acceptor antibody. More preferably, the Fab region of the first human donor antibody is operably linked to an appropriate constant region of the second human acceptor antibody to form a full-length antibody. The reconstituted human antibody can be produced by conventional gene recombinant techniques disclosed in, for example, EP125023, WO96/02576, the above-mentioned document 16 and the like. To be specific, for example, a DNA sequence designed to link a desired CDR in a donor human antibody and a desired framework region (FR) in an acceptor human antibody is synthesized by PCR method using, as primers, several oligonucleotides produced to have a region overlapping with the terminus regions of both CDR and FR (see the method described in WO98/13388). The obtained DNA is linked to a DNA encoding a human antibody constant region or a human antibody constant region mutant, which is incorporated into a expression vector and the vector is introduced into a host to allow for production, whereby a reconstituted human antibody can be obtained (see EP125023, WO96/02576). In the present specification, moreover, the human antibody encompasses an "artificial human antibody". The artificial human antibody can be produced by conventional gene recombinant techniques disclosed in, for example, the above-mentioned document 16 and the like. The antibody of the present invention also includes a fusion protein wherein the aforementioned antibody and other peptide or protein are fused. The production method of a fusion protein includes linking a polynucleotide encoding the antibody of the present invention and a polynucleotide encoding other peptide or polypeptide to match the frame, introducing same into an expression vector, and allowing expression thereof in a host, and techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art can be used. As other peptide to be fused with the antibody of the present invention, known peptides such as FLAG (Hopp, T.P. et al., BioTechnology (1988) 6, 1204-1210), 6×H is consisting of six His (histidine) residues, 10×His, human c-myc fragment, VSV-GP fragment, p18HIV fragment, T7-tag, HSV-tag, E-tag, SV40T antigen fragment, lck tag, α-tubulin fragment, B-tag, Protein C fragment and the like can be used. Examples of other polypeptide to be fused with the antibody of the present invention include GST (glutathione-S-transferase), HA (influenza hemagglutinin), immunoglobulin constant region, β-galactosidase, MBP (maltose binding protein) and the like. A commercially available polynucleotide encoding such peptide or polypeptide is fused with a polynucleotide encoding the antibody of the present invention, and a fusion polynucleotide prepared thereby is expressed, whereby a fusion polypeptide can be prepared. The antibody of the present invention may be a conjugate antibody bound with various molecules, for example, polymer substances such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), hyaluronic acid and the like, radioactive substance, fluorescent substance, luminescence substance, enzyme, toxin and the like. Such conjugate antibody can be obtained by chemically modifying the obtained antibody. The modification method of antibody has already been established in this field (e.g., US5057313, US5156840). The antibody of the present invention is preferably isolated or purified. Being "isolated or purified" means that an operation to remove components other than the component of interest has been applied to the state of natural presence. The purity of the isolated or purified antibody of the present invention (ratio of the weight of the antibody of the present invention to the total protein weight) is generally 50% or more, preferably 70% or more, more preferably 90% or more, most preferably 95% or more (e.g., substantially 100%). In a preferable embodiment, the antibody of the present invention binds to human ADAM28 in an epitope comprising the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 21, 22 or 23. Examples of the epitope comprising the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 21 (ENFSKWRGS: hADAM28s 274-282) includes an epitope consisting of a continuous partial sequence of the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 4, which comprises the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 21, and preferably has an amino acid length of 20 or less, more preferably 12 or less.

(1994) 152, 2968-2976; Better, M. and Horwitz, A. H., Methods Enzymol. (1989) 178, 476-496; Pluckthun, A. and Skerra, A., Methods Enzymol. (1989) 178, 497-515; Lamoyi, E., Methods Enzymol. (1986) 121, 652-663; Rousseaux, J. et al., Methods Enzymol. (1986) 121, 663-669; Bird, R. E. and Walker, B. W., Trends Biotechnol. (1991) 9, 132-137 and the like can be referred to. The separation and purification of the antibody of the present invention from a culture is not limited in any manner, and the separation and purification methods generally used for purification of antibody can be employed. For example, antibody can be separated and purified by appropriately selecting and combining chromatography column, filter, ultrafiltration, salting out, solvent precipitation, solvent extraction, distillation, immunoprecipitation, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, dialysis, recrystallization and the like. Examples of the chromatography include affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, hydrophobic chromatography, gelfiltration, reversed-phase chromatography, adsorption chromatography and the like (Strategies for Protein Purification and Characterization: A Laboratory Course Manual.

In addition, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition containing the above-mentioned antibody of the present invention as an active ingredient. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is useful as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for cancer; a cancer proliferation inhibitor; a cancer metastasis inhibitor and the like. While the kind of cancer is not particularly limited as long as it can achieve the prophylactic or therapeutic effect for cancer; cancer proliferation inhibitory effect; or cancer metastasis inhibitory effect by the antibody of the present invention, hepatic cancer, colorectal cancer, renal cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer (small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer), brain tumor, uterine cancer, breast cancer, multiple osteosarcoma, ovarian cancer, chronic leukemia, prostate cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, germinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, malignant lymphoma, villous cancer, pediatric malignant tumor, gall bladder or bile duct cancer and the like can be mentioned. In a preferable embodiment, the cancer to be the application target of the antibody of the present invention is a cancer that expresses human ADAM28. Whether the cancer expresses human ADAM28 can be evaluated by Western blotting, RT-PCR and the like. While not bound by theories, ADAM28 inhibits formation of IGF-1/IGFBP-3 complex by degrading IGFBP-3, and promotes cancer cell proliferation by IGF-1. The antibody of the present invention suppresses cancer cell proliferation by IGF-1 by inhibiting degradation of IGFBP-3 by ADAM28. In one embodiment, therefore, the cancer to be the application target of the antibody of the present invention is IGF-1 sensitive cancer (i.e., cancer showing IGF-1-dependent proliferation promotion). Whether or not the cancer is IGF-1 sensitive can be evaluated by analyzing the expression of IGF-1 receptor in cancer by Western blotting, RT-PCR and the like. While not bound by theories, ADAM28 inhibits induction of apoptosis of cancer cell by von Willebrand factor (vWF) by degrading vWF. The antibody of the present invention promotes induction of apoptosis of cancer cells by vWF by inhibiting degradation of vWF by ADAM28, as a result of which it suppresses cancer proliferation and metastasis. In one embodiment, therefore, the cancer to be the application target in the present invention is vWF sensitive cancer (i.e., cancer permitting induction of apoptosis by vWF). Whether or no the cancer is vWF sensitive can be evaluated by culturing the cancer cells on a vWF-coated plate and analyzing the fragmentation of DNA by, for example, the method described in J Natl Cancer Inst 2012;104:906-922.

Where necessary, polypeptide may also be included in a microcapsule (microcapsules made of hydroxymethylcellulose, gelatin, poly[methylmethacrylate] and the like), or formulated as a colloid drug delivery system (liposome, albumin microsphere, microemulsion, nanoparticles and nanocapsule etc.) (see Remington's Pharmaceutical Science 16th edition &, Oslo Ed. (1980) etc.). Furthermore, a method of formulating a drug as a sustained-release medicament is also known, and applicable to polypeptide (Langer et al., J. Biomed. Mater. Res. (1981) 15: 167-277; Langer, Chem. Tech. (1982)12: 98-105; US Patent No. 3,773,919; EP-A-58,481; Sidman et al., Biopolymers (1983) 22: 547-56; EP No. 133,988). Furthermore, it is also possible to increase the liquid amount to be subcutaneously administered by adding or blending hyaluronidase to or with the present agent (e.g., WO 2004/078140 etc.). The content of the antibody of the present invention in a pharmaceutical composition is, for example, about 0.01 - 100 wt%, preferably 0.1 - 99.9%, of the whole pharmaceutical composition.

Example The present invention is explained in more detail in the following by referring to Examples, which are not to be construed as limitative. Various gene manipulations in the Examples followed the method described in Molecular cloning third. ed. (Cold Spring Harbor Lab. Press, 2001). [Example 1] Preparation of antigen and antibody (1) Preparation of human ADAM28 recombinant protein (rhADAM28) Full length rhADAM28 was prepared and purified by the method described in Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2004; 315: 79-84. (2) Biotinylation of rhADAM28 The purified rhADAM28 was biotinylated according to the standard protocol of EZ-Link NHS-PEO4-Biotin (Thermo Scientific), and the concentration was determined by using BCA Protein Assay Kit (manufactured by PIERCE). (3) Selection of anti-human ADMA28 human antibody clones by phage display method The biotinylated rhADAM28 was immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 magnetic beads, manufactured by Invitrogen, 100 µl) at 4°C for 1 hr, and washed 5 times with 1 ml PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). Using HuCAL GOLD (manufactured by MorphoSys) for human antibody phage library, antibody selection was performed according to the method described in WO 2007/042309, WO 2006/122797 and the like. rhADAM28-immobilized beads were added to the phage library to bind an antigen-specific antibody. The magnetic beads were recovered and washed several times, and the phage was eluted from the magnetic beads. Escherichia coli cells were infected with the eluted phage and cultured at 37°C overnight. An operation of phage-rescue from the phage-infected Escherichia coli cells followed a general method (Molecular cloning third. Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Lab. Press, 2001). The selection round described above was repeated several times to concentrate a phage presenting an antibody specific to the antigen. (4) Screening for anti-human ADMA28 human antibody by ELISA The pool of Fab genes obtained after the concentration operation was subcloned to Escherichia coli expression vector. According to the method described in WO 2006/122797 and the like, the Fab antibody was expressed, and the antigen-specific antibody was screened for by the ELISA method. The Fab antibody was purified from a soluble fraction of Escherichia coli lysate according to the standard method of Strep-Tactin column (manufactured by IBA). In addition, the purity of the purified antibody was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and the concentration was determined by using BCA Protein Assay Kit (manufactured by PIERCE). (5) Analysis of base sequence of anti-human ADAM28 human antibody clones The obtained 2 clones (211-12, 211-14) of Escherichia coli were cultured, and plasmids were recovered (QIAprep Spin MiniPrep kit: manufactured by QIAGEN) and used for the base sequence analysis. Table 1 shows the amino acid sequences of CDRs (complementarity determining regions) of the respective clones. The full-length amino acid sequences of the variable region of each clone are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 17 - 20.

HEK293T cells were transfected with these expression vectors according to the standard method of Lipofectamine (manufactured by Invitrogen), and the culture supernatant after culture for 72 hr was recovered. As the medium, DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% Ultra Low IgG FBS (manufactured by Invitrogen) was used. From the culture supernatant, IgG antibody was purified by the standard method using rProteinA Sepharose Fast Flow (manufactured by GE healthcare). Protein after purification was confirmed to show a single band by SDS-PAGE, and the concentration was determined by using BCA Protein Assay Kit (manufactured by PIERCE). (7) Preparation of anti-human ADAM28 mouse monoclonal antibody Using purified rhADAM28 as an antigen, monoclonal antibodies to human ADAM28 protein were established. Five clones were first selected by ELISA using rhADAM28, and clone 297-2F3 was selected as a candidate antibody to human ADAM28. The mono-reactivity of monoclonal antibody (297-2F3) was determined by immunoblotting for recombinant human ADAM28. [Example 2] Suppressive effect of anti-human ADAM28 antibodies on Human ADAM28 enzyme activity rhADAM28 and anti-ADAM28 antibody were incubated at the weight ratio shown in the Figure for 2 hr, IGFBP-3 (100 ng) was added and incubated at 37°C for 24 hr, and the reaction was terminated with SDS-sample buffer containing 5 mM EDTA. Thereafter, the reaction product was applied to SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gel), and the level of degradation of IGFBP-3 was detected by the immunoblot method using anti-IGFBP-3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) (Fig. 1). Both 211-14 and 211-12 antibodies suppressed degradation of IGFBP-3 by human ADAM28. [Example 3] Proliferation suppressive effect of anti-human ADAM28 antibodies on breast cancer cell line The mitogenic effects of IGF-I on MDA-MB231 cells were measured with 5-bromo-2'deoxy-uridine (BrdUrd) Labeling and Detection Kit III (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After synchronization and growth arrest, cells were treated with 1 µg/mL IGF-I in DMEM containing 1% FBS. After synchronization and growth arrest, cells were treated with 1 µg/mL IGF-I in DMEM containing 1% FBS. After 6 hours, BrdUrd (10 µmol/L) was added to the media and cultured for the next 42 hours. To determine the contribution of ADAM28 activity to the mitogenic effect of IGF-I, cells were incubated with 1 or 5 µg/mL anti-ADAM28 antibody 30 minutes before the IGF-I treatment, and then reacted with BrdUrd for 42 hours in the presence of IGF-I (Fig. 2). All of 211-14, 211-12 and 297-2F3 antibodies suppressed in vitro growth of MDA-MB231 cells. [Example 4] Suppressive effect of anti-human ADAM28 antibodies on cancer cell proliferation in vivo ADAM28 high expression breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 ffLuc-cp156 that constitutively expresses luciferase was prepared by a lentivirus vector, and transplanted (2 x 10e6 cells) to a breast subcutaneous tissue of NOD/SCID mouse (Six-week-old male, Charles River Laboratories International Inc, Washington, MA). After transplantation, anti-ADAM28 antibody (2 mg/kg/mice) was topically injected 5 times at 2 day intervals, and the suppressive effect on tumor growth was examined. After intraperitoneal administration of D-luciferin (150 mg/Kg) (Promega Co, Madison, MI), the luminescence was detected by in vivo imaging system (IVIS)-100 (Xenogen Co., Alameda, CA) (Fig. 3). Both 211-14 and 211-12 antibodies suppressed in vivo proliferation of MDA-MB231 ffLuc-cp156. [Example 5] Suppressive effect of anti-human ADAM28 antibody on cancer cell metastasis in vivo Male NOD/SCID mice (6 weeks old) (Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Wilmington, MA) were injected with PC-9ffLuc-cp156 cells (1x106 cells in 300 µl of PBS) into the tail vein. Lung metastasis was monitored by bioluminescence imaging using the In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS)-100 camera system for detection of luciferase activity (Xenogen Co., Alameda, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. During imaging, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and received intraperitoneal injection of D-luciferin (150 mg/kg; Promega Co., Madison, WI) and 1 minute later, photons from the animal whole bodies were counted. To examine the effect of neutralizing anti-ADAM28 antibody on the lung metastasis, PC-9ffLuc-cp156 cells were incubated with 5 µg/ml anti-human ADAM28 mouse monoclonal antibody (297-2F3) or 5 µg/ml non-immune IgG for 2 hours at 4°C and then intravenously injected into mice (n = 9 mice per each group) (Fig. 4). Cancer metastasis was suppressed by 297-2F3 administration. [Example 6] In Example 4, RT-PCR with luciferase specific primers was performed using RNA extracted from each organ of the mouse at 6 weeks after transplantation of cancer cells, the presence or absence of tumor-derived gene expression was confirmed, and the presence or absence of inartificial metastasis was examined (Fig. 5). Both 211-14 and 211-12 antibodies suppressed micrometastasis of cancer cells. [Example 7] With cDNA from hybridoma producing mouse anti-human ADAM28 monoclonal antibody 297-2F3, obtained in the above-mentioned Example 1(7), variable regions of the antibody were PCR-amplified, subcloned to a cloning vector, and the base sequence of the regions was analyzed. Table 2 shows the amino acid sequences of the CDRs (complementary sex determination regions). The full-length amino acid sequences of the light chain and heavy chain variable regions are respectively shown in SEQ ID NOs: 146 and 147.

The full-length amino acid sequences of the light chain and heavy chain variable regions of the thus-obtained humanized 297-2F3 are shown in SEQ ID NOs: 30 and 31, respectively. [Example 9] Identification of epitope (1) Using a peptide array immobilized with partial peptides of human ADAM28s, epitope mapping was performed for the anti-human ADAM28 antibodies 211-12 and 297-2F3.

The results suggest that the epitope of 211-12 contains the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 21 (ENFSKWRGS) common to peptides #25 and #26. 297-2F3 specifically bound to the above-mentioned peptides #65 and #66. In the consensus amino acid sequence (CLFNAPLPT: SEQ ID NO: 145) of peptides #65 and #66, cysteine is not recognized by antibodies in most cases. Therefore, it is suggested that the epitope of 297-2F3 contains the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 23 (LFNAPLPT). It was confirmed that 297-2F3 specifically recognizes SEQ ID NO: 23 as an epitope by dot blot using a lysate of Escherichia coli forcibly expressing a fusion protein comprising the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 23 added to the C-terminal of MBP. [Example 9] Identification of epitope (2) Fusion proteins comprising a partial sequence of the following regions of human ADAM28s (SEQ ID NO: 4) added to the C-terminal of MBP were respectively prepared. 399-540, 399-497, 491-540, 491-510, 501-520, 511-530, 521-540, 513-522, 515-524, 517-526, 519-528 As a control, a fusion protein comprising a partial sequence of the following region of human ADAM28m (SEQ ID NO: 2) added to the C-terminal of MBP was prepared. 517-526 (human ADAM28m, as control) The reactivity of anti-human ADAM28 antibody 211-14 to the above-mentioned fusion proteins was evaluated by Western blotting. As a result, 211-14 strongly bound to a fusion proteins containing a partial sequence of the regions 399-540, 491-540, 511-530 and 517-526 of human ADAM28s. The results suggest that the epitope of 211-14 contains the 517-526 region (TELWGPGRRT, SEQ ID NO: 22) of human ADAM28s.
