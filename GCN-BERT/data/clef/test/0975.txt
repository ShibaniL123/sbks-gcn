An unpublished application, IN 1415/CHE/2011 assigned to Hetero Research Foundation discloses a process for the preparation of rilpivirine. According to the application, rilpivirine can be prepared by reacting the 4-(4-chloropyrimidin-2-ylamino)benzonitrile with (E)-3-(4-amino-3,5-dimethylphenyl)acrylonitrile hydrochloride in the presence of p-toluene sulfonic acid monohydrate and 1,4-dioxane.
