The present invention relates to a kit for make-up and/or care of nails and/or false nails, as well as to a method for make-up and/or care of nails and/or false nails. Conventionally, make-up or care of nails or false nails is achieved by means of liquid make-up or care compositions further called nail varnishes. This nail varnish is generally applied in the form of layers superposed to the surface of the nail (or of the false nail) to be made up or cared for, while observing an intermediate drying step between each applied varnish layer. In order to notably avoid that the pigments of the nail varnish compositions leave spots on the nails (or false nails) or make them yellow, the prior application of a transparent base composition, or <<base-coat>>, is recommended. However this make-up and care method does not prove to be entirely satisfactory. Conventional base-coat compositions are soluble in the solvents of conventional make-up removers. Therefore, when it is desired to change the varnish color, it is necessary to remove the make-up from the whole of the nail varnish layer and of the base-coat layer, and to then apply again a new layer of base-coat on the nail (or the false nail) before a new make-up or care of the nails (or the false nails). This represents a waste of time and causes excessive consumption of the base-coat composition. Further, successive make-up removals with conventional make-up removers such as acetone or ethyl acetate tend to make the nails fragile. Therefore, there exists a need for a novel method for make-up and/or care of nails and/or false nails with which it is possible to get rid of the drawbacks of the make-up methods described above. The present invention aims at proposing a method for make-up and/or care of nails and/or false nails allowing the nails or false nails to be rapidly made up again. The present invention aims at proposing a method for make-up and/or care of nails and/or false nails with which it is possible to reduce the contact of solvents with the nails. The present invention also aims at proposing a method for make-up and/or care of nails with which it is possible to avoid fragility of the nails caused by repeated make-up removals. More specifically, the present invention aims at providing a kit comprising a base composition which cannot be removed with conventional make-up removers, but which is removable with a specific make-up remover on the one hand, and a specific make-up remover for removing said base composition on the other hand. The present invention relates to a kit for make-up and/or care of nails and/or false nails, comprising: a composition C1 for make-up and/or care of nails and/or false nails comprising at least one film-forming polymer, said polymer being insoluble in acetone, methyl acetate and ethyl acetate, anda composition C2 for make-up removal comprising at least one volatile solvent S2 selected from the group formed by C2-C5 alcohols, C5-C12 alkanes, and mixtures thereof, said solvent S2 being able to solubilize the film-forming polymer of composition C1. The film-forming polymer of composition C1 is insoluble in acetone. According to an embodiment, the latter is also insoluble in liquid ketones at room temperature such as methylethylketone, methylisobutylketone, diisobutylketone, isophorone and cyclohexanone. The film-forming polymer of the composition C1 is insoluble in methyl acetate and ethyl acetate. According to an embodiment, the latter is also insoluble in C3-C4 alkyl acetate, such as propyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, isobutyl-acetate and tert-butyl acetate. Preferably the film-forming polymer of composition C1 is insoluble in ethyl acetate. The solvents of the invention are organic or mineral solvents, which are physiologically acceptable. By <<volatile solvent>>, is meant in the sense of the invention a solvent which may evaporate in contact with keratinic materials in less than one hour, at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure. The volatile solvent(s) of the invention are liquid solvents at room temperature, having non-zero vapor pressure, at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure, in particular ranging from 0.13 Pa to 40,000 Pa (10−3 to 300 mm of Hg), in particular ranging from 1.3 Pa to 13,000 Pa (0.01 to 100 mm of Hg), and more particularly ranging from 1.3 Pa to 1300 Pa (0.01 to 10 mm of Hg). By <<non-volatile solvent>>, is meant a solvent remaining on the nails at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure for at least several hours and notably having a vapor pressure of less than 10−3 mm of Hg (0.13 Pa). By <<solvent able to solubilize the film-forming polymer of composition C1>>, it is meant that a solvent is able to remove make-up from a nail or a false nail coated with a dry layer of composition C1. Generally, a solvent is <<able to solubilize>> a polymer when a mixture of said solvent and of said polymer forms a homogeneous solution, and not a dispersion or biphasic mixture.

By <<C2-C5 alcohol×>, is meant an organic compound comprising at least one hydroxyl group —OH, preferably exactly one hydroxyl group —OH, and with 2 to 5 carbon atoms and which is moreover liquid at room temperature, i.e. from 15° C. to 30° C.

By <<C5-C12 alkane>>, is meant a cyclic or acyclic, linear or branched, saturated hydrocarbon compound, exclusively consisting of carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms, which is moreover liquid at room temperature, i.e. from 15° C. to 30° C.

In the composition C1 of the kit according to the invention, the film-forming polymer is generally in solution in at least one volatile solvent S1 selected from the group consisting of C2-C5 alcohols, C5-C12 alkanes and mixtures thereof. The solvent S1 is therefore able to solubilize the film-forming polymer of composition C1. The solvent S1 of the composition C1 is preferably identical with the solvent S2 of the composition C2.

This may be a random polymer or a sequenced polymer, also called a <<block copolymer>>.

They may for example be illustrated as follows: (block A) (block B) for diblock copolymers and (block A) (block B) (block A) or (block B) (block A) (block B) for triblock copolymers. According to the invention, multiblock copolymers designate copolymers comprising more than three blocks.

The present invention also relates to a make-up removal method for nails and/or false nails using a kit according to the invention. The present invention thus relates to a make-up removal method for nails and/or false nails comprising the application of a make-up removal composition C2 on a nail or a false nail coated with a base coating consisting of at least one layer of composition C1, by which said base coating is removed from the nail or the false nail, said compositions C1 and C2 being as defined above. According to an embodiment, the make-up removal method of the invention further comprises a preliminary step for make-up of the nails and/or the false nails, consisting of applying on a nail or a false nail, a make-up composition C1 as defined above, by which a base coating is deposited, consisting of at least one layer of composition C1 on a nail or a false nail. Said base coating is intended to be removed as a make-up, a few hours or a few days after, with the make-up removal composition C2 of the kit of the invention. Between the make-up step with which a base coating is deposited and the make-up removal step by which said base coating is removed, the user typically applies: a make-up and/or care by using for example the composition C3 or any other nail varnish composition, and then a few hours or a few days after,a make-up remover by for example using the composition C4 for removal of the make-up of the kit of the invention or any other make-up remover (provided that the latter does not remove the make-up of the base coating). The sequence of both steps above forms a make-up/make-up removal cycle which may be repeated several times. The user may thus carry out one, two, three, or even up to ten make-up/make-up removal cycles. The kit of the invention thus allows the user to remove make-up and again apply make-up on a split nail, or even change the varnish color at will, rapidly and non-aggressively for the nail, which existing make-up methods cannot provide. For example it is possible to contemplate the change in the varnish color every day of the week and to perform make-up removal of the base coating with the composition C2 at the end of the week. Further, the kit of the invention gives the possibility of carrying out several make-up removals of the varnish layer without drying the nail, since the latter remains protected from the make-up removal agent by the base coating. According to an embodiment, each step for applying the method described above is followed by a drying step, with which the volatile solvents are evaporated. The weight percentages given in this application may be assimilated to the dry material weight percentage of the applied compounds. By <<comprise one>> or <<include one>> should be understood <<comprise at least one>> or <<include at least one>>, except if explicitly specified otherwise. EXAMPLES The invention will now be illustrated by means of the following examples. Example 1 A base coating composition according to the invention is prepared by solubilizing 40% by weight of polyamide resin (VERSAMID® 930 BASF) in 60% by weight of a 50/50 mixture of absolute ethanol and of n-heptane. Make-Up A base coating is deposited on the nails by applying the thereby prepared composition. After drying, a layer of conventional colored varnish composition based on nitrocellulose is deposited on the base coating. Make-Up Removal After drying, the colored varnish composition layer as a make-up is removed with acetone, without altering the base coating. Next, said base coating is as for it removed with a 50/50 ethanol/heptane mixture. Example 2 A base coating composition according to the invention is prepared by solubilizing 40% by weight of hydrocarbon tackifying resin (Eastotac™ Resin H-142W—Eastman Chemical Company) in 60% by weight of n-heptane.

After drying, a conventional colored varnish composition layer based on nitrocellulose is deposited on the base coating. Make-Up Removal After drying, the colored varnish composition layer is removed as a make-up with acetone, without altering the base coating. Next, said base coating is as for it removed with heptane. 1.
