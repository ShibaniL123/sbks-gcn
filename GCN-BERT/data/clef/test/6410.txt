IODINE(III)-MEDIATED RADIOFLUORINATION CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Appl. No. 61/949,302, filed March 7, 2014, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to iodonium ylide compounds, and more particularly to iodonium ylide useful for promoting radio fluorination reactions. BACKGROUND Historically, the formation of aromatic C-F bonds has been challenging in the field of synthetic organic chemistry, and even more so in radio chemistry, with the shortlived radionuclide fluorine-18 (18F; t½ = 109.7 min) for molecular imaging by positron emission tomography (PET). Fluorine-18 labelled compounds and radiopharmaceuticals are the mainstay of functional molecular imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) for a broad range of applications including clinical diagnosis and drug discovery. Consequently, there is a rapidly growing demand for new 18F-labelled agents to probe biological processes and targets in vivo. Fluorine-18 is most readily prepared in high specific activity as no -carrier-added [18F]fluoride ion, by proton irradiation of [180]H20 (180(p,n)18F nuclear reaction) in low energy (10-16 MeV) medical cyclotrons. Most 18F-labelling methodologies for aromatic nucleophilic substitution (SNAT) reactions employ naked [18F]fluoride ion with appropriately activated (electron-deficient) aromatic / heteroaromatic substrates. However, radio fluorination of non-activated arenes represents a major challenge in the field and there is an urgent need for a general and practical methodology that can introduce 18F into molecules which cannot be labelled using a conventional aromatic nucleophilic substitution (SNAT) reaction. Electrophilic fluorination reactions with carrier-added 18F-F2 gas and its derivatives (e.g\, 18F-CH3C02F) have enabled the development of 18F-labeled aromatics by direct electrophilic substitution or demetalation reactions with organometallic reagents such as aryl stannanes (Miller et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2008, 47, 8998-9033). Electrophilic radio synthesis with 18F-F2 and its derivatives involve the use of carrier- added fluorine gas and consequently result in products with relatively low specific activities. Such reactions also require specialized equipment as well as technical expertise for the safe handling of F2 (g). Commercial availability of high specific activity, no- carrier added 18F-fiuoride has led to this reagent becoming the most widely used radiofluorinating species. Synthesis of aromatic molecules with 18F-fluoride is typically achieved by nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions with electron-deficient (activated) aromatics, and these reactions have been used extensively to prepare high specific activity radiopharmaceuticals (Cai et al, Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2008, 2853-2873). However, labeling of electron-rich (non-activated or deactivated) aromatics with 18F- fluoride remains a long-standing and unmet challenge in routine PET radiopharmaceutical production. SUMMARY The present disclosure provides a method for radiofluorination that allows 18F- aromatic fluorides (including heteroaromatic fluorides) to be prepared in high radiochemical yields. The method uses a spirocyclic hypervalent iodine(III)-mediated radiofluorination strategy, based on iodonium ylides. The method involves stable, easily purified precursors and is readily implemented with standard workup procedures. The method provides excellent regioselectivity and allows the incorporation of 18F into a wide array of aromatic compounds, including non-activated aromatic compounds (including heteroaromatic compounds). The versatility of the method makes it suitable for routine radiopharmaceutical production. Accordingly, the present invention provides, inter alia, a process for fluorodeiodination of an aromatic iodide compound comprising: (a) oxidizing an aromatic iodide compound (Ar-I), to form an iodonium compound; (b) reacting the iodonium compound with a compound of Formula A: A to form an iodonium ylide such as a compound of Formula D as described below; and (c) reacting the iodonium ylide with a fluoride source to form an aromatic fluoride compound (Ar-F); wherein the variables are as defined below.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure provides a hypervalent iodine(III)-mediated radio fluorination strategy, based on iodonium ylides, preferably spirocyclic iodonium ylides (Figures 1A and IB). The technique affords 18F-aryl fluorides in high radiochemical yields. The technique involves stable, easily purified precursors and is readily implemented with standard workup procedures. The conceptual advantages of excellent regioselectivity and viability of incorporation of 18F into a wide array of aromatic compounds including non-activated aromatic compounds makes this methodology suitable for routine radiopharmaceutical production. While not being limited by any theory, it is believed that the present disclosure provides an auxiliary capable of stabilizing the iodine(III) center of the iodonium ylide precursors, particularly if bound to non-activated arenes, disfavoring iodine(III) decomposition22 and disproportionation23 pathways. As shown in Figure 2A, it is believed that the radio fluorination of spiroiodonium ylides can occur through a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate. The extent of stabilization of the iodonium ylide should be such that it still enables the formation of 18F- labelled products via the addition/reductive elimination mechanism. Figure 2B shows the results of fluorination experiments carried out with various biphenyl spiroiodine(III) precursors (2 mg), TEAB (7 mg), DMF (400 μί), 120 °C, 10 min; Incorporation yield and product identity were determined by radio TLC and radioHPLC respectively (n = 3). Experiments with derivatives of Meldrum's acid 8a and barbituric acid 9a, based on a challenging electron-neutral biphenyl substrate, provided radiochemical conversions of 47% and 53%, respectively. Analogs incorporating substituents on the nitrogen atoms of barbiturates 8b-d were relatively unstable at room temperature, and analogues with alkyl groups other than methyl on the quaternary carbon of diesters 9b-d were not crystalline. A spirocyclohexyl precursor, 10a, was a stable crystalline solid that showed reactivity towards 18F- fluoride ion similar to that of 9a (52% incorporation yield). Cyclobutyl 10b and cyclopentyl 10c groups provided increased conversions, 70% and 85%, respectively. The biphenyl precursor 10c provided good thermal stability under the radio labelling conditions (DMF, 120 °C, 10 min). Figure 3A is a chemical scheme showing the method of preparation of iodine (III) precursors that can be used for radio fluorination, and conditions that can be used for radio fluorination. The labelling precursors 13 can be prepared from the corresponding aryl iodine(III) derivatives 12 or by a one -pot procedure from aryl iodide 11. For radio labelling conditions, a simple combination of dried [18F]fluoride with tetraethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB27) and spirocyclic iodine precursor in DMF can be used. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) and butylated hydro xytoluene (BHT), could be used as radical scavengers, but did not improve radio labelling efficiency. Figure 3B shows examples of structures of non-activated 18F compounds that were prepared using the methodology described in the present disclosure. Hindered alkyl substituents without activating groups were successfully radio labelled with 18F in 45- 56% incorporation yield (15 & 16). Arenes with substituents at the benzyl position. (17- 19) underwent 18F- incorporation in modest to good yields. A protected form of 4- [18F]fluorobenzyl amine (18) was also prepared by the present method in 40% yield. Arenes incorporating alkoxy groups 20-23 were also fluorinated, with 21-23 being examples that also included hindered ortho substituents. Bromo derivative 22 represents a new building block that could be further functionalized or linked to complex molecular motifs through cross-coupling reactions. Radiosynthesis of N-acetyl 3-[18F]fluoroaniline (24) using the presently described method avoided the undesired formation of [18F]fluoro methane that can be generated via the reaction of [18F]fluoride with a Ν,Ν,Ν- trimethylammonium-3-nitrobenzene trifiate precursor. Indoline 25 and pyridine 26 were also radio fluorinated in 34% and 65% incorporation yield, respectively, demonstrating applicability of the method disclosed herein for 18F-labelling of nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The method disclosed herein could also be applied to radio fluorination of arenes comprising electron- withdrawing groups, including trifluoromethyl, halide, nitro and ester substituents at the meta (non-activated) positions of the aromatic ring (27-30). Two arene substrates comprising a CF3 group (27 & 28) were also radio labelled with 18F at the meto-position in excess of 45% conversion. Compound 27 demonstrates compatibility of the method with aryl halides where the aryl halide could potentially be further functionalized via a coupling reactions. Ester 29 was labelled in 77% conversion and could be directly converted to 3-[18F]fluoro benzyl alcohol, which is a key fragment of [18F]Lapatinib. Finally, the example of fluorobenzophenone 31, showed that the present method could also be used for an activated arene with an electron-withdrawing group at the para position. The above-mentioned examples demonstrate that the radio fluorination method described herein is widely applicable. If necessary, functional groups such as hydroxy groups, amines and carboxylic acids could be protected using protecting groups for carrying out the claimed methods. The need for protection and deprotection, and the selection of appropriate protecting groups, can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. The chemistry of protecting groups is described, e.g. , in Kocienski, Protecting Groups, (Thieme, 2007); Robertson, Protecting Group Chemistry, (Oxford University Press, 2000); Smith et ah, March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, 6th Ed. (Wiley, 2007); Peturssion et ah, "Protecting Groups in Carbohydrate Chemistry," J. Chem. Educ, 1997, 74(11), 1297; and Wuts et ah, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th Ed., (Wiley, 2006). Chromatographic analysis (radioTLC and radioHPLC) of crude reaction mixtures showed that the sole radioactive products were the 18F-radio labelled arenes along with unreacted [18F] fluoride. No other radioactive byproducts were detected. While not being limited by any theory, it is believed that the selectivity can be explained by the substantial difference of electron densities between two carbon atoms attached to iodine(III) center. The methods described herein could also be applied to complex molecules and PET radiopharmaceuticals, syntheses of which are shown in the Schemes of Figure 4. An N,(9-protected [18F]fiuorophenylalanine 34 was successfully labelled via the corresponding spiroiodine(III) precursor in 55% incorporation yield. [18F]Fluoroestrone (37), was also synthesized, in 23% incorporation yield. As an example of a fluorine- 18 labelled azide (which have been used for "click" synthesis of 18F-labelled peptides), 4- [18F]fluorobenzyl azide (Fig. 4, 40) was prepared using a spiroiodine(III) precursor 39, prepared from 4-iodobenzyl azide by a one -pot method, and directly radio labelled and isolated 40 in 25% uncorrected radiochemical yield within 40 min, relative to dried [18F] fluoride. The method disclosed herein was also used to prepare a PET radiopharmaceutical, 5-[18F]fluorouracil (44) by converting 5-iodo-2,4- dimethoxypyrimidine to the corresponding spiroiodine(III) precursor 42, which underwent a stepwise radio fluorination and deprotection by aqueous hydrobromic acid, to generate 40 in 1 1% isolated uncorrected radiochemical yield from dried [18F]fluoride with a specific activity of 0.4 Ci-μηιοΐ"1. Definitions Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. For the terms "e.g." and "such as," and grammatical equivalents thereof, the phrase "and without limitation" is understood to follow unless explicitly stated otherwise. As used herein, the singular forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The term "about" means "approximately" (e.g. , plus or minus approximately 10% of the indicated value).

Example cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, cyclohexadienyl, norbornyl, norpinyl, bicyclo[2.1.1]hexanyl, bicyclo[l . l . l]pentanyl and the like. In some embodiments, cycloalkyl is cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl. Also included in the definition of cycloalkyl are moieties that have one or more aromatic rings fused (i.e. , having a bond in common with) to the cycloalkyl ring, e.g. , benzo or thienyl derivatives of cyclopentane, cyclohexane and the like, fer example indanyl or tetrahydronaphthyl. A cycloalkyl group containing a fused aromatic ring can be attached through any ring- forming atom including a ring-forming atom of the fused aromatic ring. The term "heterocycloalkyl", employed alone or in combination with other terms, refers to non-aromatic ring or ring system, which may optionally contain one or more alkenylene groups as part of the ring structure, which has at least one heteroatom ring member independently selected from nitrogen, sulfur oxygen and phosphorus, and which has 4-10 ring members, 4-7 ring members or 4-6 ring members. Included in heterocycloalkyl are monocyclic 4-, 5-, 6- and 7-membered heterocycloalkyl groups. Heterocycloalkyl groups can include mono- or bicyclic (e.g. , having two fused or bridged rings) ring systems. In some embodiments, the heterocycloalkyl group is a monocyclic group having 1 , 2 or 3 heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen. Examples of heterocycloalkyl groups include azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine, morpholine, thiomorpholine, pyran, azepane, tetrahydropyran, tetrahydrofuran, dihydropyran, dihydrofuran and the like. Ring-forming carbon atoms and heteroatoms of a heterocycloalkyl group can be optionally substituted by oxo or sulfido (e.g. , C(=0), S(=0), C(S) or S(=0)¾ etc.) or a nitrogen atom can be quaternized. The heterocycloalkyl group can be attached through a ring-forming carbon atom or a ring-forming heteroatom. In some embodiments, the heterocycloalkyl group contains 0 to 3 double bonds. In some embodiments, the heterocycloalkyl group contains 0 to 2 double bonds. Also included in the definition of heterocycloalkyl are moieties that have one or more aromatic rings fused (i.e. , having a bond in common with) to the heterocycloalkyl ring, e.g., benzo or thienyl derivatives of piperidine, morpholine, azepine, etc. A heterocycloalkyl group containing a fused aromatic ring can be attached through any ring- forming atom including a ring- forming atom of the fused aromatic ring. Examples of heterocycloalkyl groups include 1 , 2, 3, 4-tetrahydroquinoline, dihydrobenzofuran, azetidine, azepane, diazepan (e.g. , 1 ,4-diazepan), pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine, morpholine, thiomorpholine, pyran, tetrahydrofuran and di- and tetra-hydropyran. At certain places, the definitions or embodiments refer to specific rings (e.g. , an azetidine ring, a pyridine ring, etc.). Unless otherwise indicated, these rings can be attached to any ring member provided that the valency of the atom is not exceeded. For example, an azetidine ring may be attached at any position of the ring, whereas an azetidin-3-yl ring is attached at the 3-position. The compounds described herein can be asymmetric (e.g., having one or more stereocenters). All stereoisomers, such as enantiomers and diastereoisomers, are intended unless otherwise indicated. Compounds of the present invention that contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Methods on how to prepare optically active forms from optically inactive starting materials are known in the art, such as by resolution of racemic mixtures or by stereoselective synthesis. Many geometric isomers of olefins, C=N double bonds and the like can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. Resolution of racemic mixtures of compounds can be carried out by any of numerous methods known in the art. One method includes fractional recrystallization using a chiral resolving acid which is an optically active, salt-forming organic acid. Suitable resolving agents for fractional recrystallization methods are, e.g., optically active acids, such as the D and L forms of tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, lactic acid or the various optically active camphorsulfonic acids such as β-camphorsulfonic acid. Other resolving agents suitable for fractional crystallization methods include stereoisomerically pure forms of a-methyl- benzylamine (e.g. , S and R forms, or diastereoisomerically pure forms), 2-phenylglycinol, norephedrine, ephedrine, N-methylephedrine, cyclohexylethylamine, 1 ,2- diaminocyclohexane and the like. Resolution of racemic mixtures can also be carried out by elution on a column packed with an optically active resolving agent (e.g., dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine). Suitable elution solvent composition can be determined by one skilled in the art. In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention have the (R)- configuration. In other embodiments, the compounds have the (^-configuration. In compounds with more than one chiral centers, each of the chiral centers in the compound may be independently (R) or (S), unless otherwise indicated. Compounds of the invention also include tautomeric forms. Tautomeric forms result from the swapping of a single bond with an adjacent double bond together with the concomitant migration of a proton. Tautomeric forms include prototropic tautomers which are isomeric protonation states having the same empirical formula and total charge. Example prototropic tautomers include ketone - enol pairs, amide - imidic acid pairs, lactam - lactim pairs, enamine - imine pairs, and annular forms where a proton can occupy two or more positions of a heterocyclic system, e.g. , 1H- and 3H- imidazole, 1H-, 2H- and 4H- 1 ,2,4-triazole, 1H- and 2H- isoindole and 1H- and 2H-pyrazole. Tautomeric forms can be in equilibrium or sterically locked into one form by appropriate substitution. Compounds of the invention can also include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the intermediates or final compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. The term, "compound," as used herein is meant to include all stereoisomers, geometric isomers, tautomers and isotopes of the structures depicted.

The need for protection and deprotection, and the selection of appropriate protecting groups, can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. The chemistry of protecting groups is described, e.g., in Kocienski, Protecting Groups, (Thieme, 2007); Robertson, Protecting Group Chemistry, (Oxford University Press, 2000); Smith et al., March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, 6th Ed. (Wiley, 2007); Peturssion et ah, "Protecting Groups in Carbohydrate Chemistry," J. Chem. Educ, 1997, 74(1 1), 1297; and Wuts et al, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th Ed., (Wiley, 2006). Reactions can be monitored according to any suitable method known in the art. For example, product formation can be monitored by spectroscopic means, such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy {e.g., !Η or 13C), infrared spectroscopy, spectrophotometry (e.g., UV- visible), mass spectrometry or by chromatographic methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or thin layer chromatography (TLC). The Schemes below provide general guidance in connection with preparing the compounds of the invention. One skilled in the art would understand that the preparations shown in the Schemes can be modified or optimized using general knowledge of organic chemistry to prepare various compounds of the invention. The processes provided herein can be performed, e.g., according to the synthesis shown in Scheme 1. For example, an aromatic iodide compound (Ar-I) is oxidized (e.g., in the presence of an oxidizing agent and, optionally, a carboxylate source) and subsequently reacted with a compound of Formula A in a "one -pot" reaction to form a compound of Formula D. The compound of Formula D is then reacted under fiuorodeiodination conditions (e.g., reaction with a fluoride source in the presence of a base) to afford an aromatic fluoride compound (Ar-F). Scheme 1 Formula A, base "one-pot" The processes provided herein can be also be performed, e.g., according to the synthesis shown in Scheme 2. For example, an aromatic iodide compound (Ar-I) is first oxidized (e.g., in the presence of an oxidizing agent and, optionally, a carboxylate source) to form iodonium compound (ii). Iodonium (ii) is then reacted with a compound of Formula A under basic conditions (e.g., reaction in the presence of sodium bicarbonate) to form a compound of Formula D. The compound of Formula D is then reacted under fluorodeiodination conditions (e.g., reaction with a fluoride source) to afford an aromatic fluoride compound (Ar-F). Scheme 2 odination" Ar-F The processes provided herein can be also be performed, e.g., according to the synthesis shown in Scheme 3. For example, an aromatic compound (i) is deaminated under Sandmeyer reaction conditions (e.g., reaction with £BuN02 in the presence of a strong acid) to afford aromatic compound (ii). Subsequent acid chloride formation (e.g., reaction with oxalyl chloride), amidation (e.g., reaction with ΝΗ4ΟΗ) and dehydration (e.g., reaction with SO2CI2) affords the cyano-substituted aromatic compound (iii). Reaction of (iii) with an aromatic alkyne under Sonogashira coupling conditions (e.g., reaction in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4, Cul, and triethylamine, optionally in a microwave reactor) affords the alkyne coupled aromatic compound (iv), which can be used to prepare the corresponding iodonium ylide and aromatic fluoride compound according to the procedures shown in Scheme 1 and Scheme 2.

Labeled Compounds and Assay Methods The present invention further includes synthetic methods for preparing isotopically- labeled {e.g., radio-labeled compounds) compounds useful in the investigations of biological processes, in normal and abnormal tissues. Thus, another aspect of the present invention relates to isotopically- labeled compounds (e.g., radiolabeled compounds) that would be useful not only in imaging techniques but also in vitro and in vivo assays.

The invention will be described in greater detail by way of specific examples. The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of non- critical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results. EXAMPLES Reagents, Solvents, and Chromatography All commercial reagents were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, Fisher Scientific, Acros, Strem Chemicals, Oakwood Chemical, or Matrix Scientific and, unless otherwise stated, used as received. All solvents were of reagent or anhydrous grade quality and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, or Fisher Scientific. All deuterated solvents were purchased from Cambridge Isotopes. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on pre-coated glass-backed plates (EMD TLC Silica gel 60 F254) and visualized using a UV lamp (254 nm), potassium permanganate, and/or iodine stain. Flash column chromatography was performed using a Biotage Isolera™ One system and preloaded Biotage Zip or refillable Snap silica gel columns. Silica gel for flash chromatography was high purity grade 40 - 63 μηι pore size and purchased from Sigma- Aldrich. Yields provided herein refer to purified and spectroscopically pure compounds. Melting points were determined using a Thomas Hoover model apparatus and are uncorrected. Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry !H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300 MHz or a Varian Unity/Inova 500 spectrometer, and resonances given in parts per million (ppm) relative residual solvent (19F chemical shifts are unreferenced unless otherwise noted). Peak multiplicities are designated by the following abbreviations: s, singlet; bs, broad singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; dd, doublet of doublets; dt, doublet of triplets; ddd, doublet of doublet of doublets; br, broad; and J, coupling constant in Hz. UV spectra were recorded on either a Hitachi U- 1 100 Spectrophotometer of a Spectronic Genesys 2 instrument. IR spectra were recorded from neat compounds or solutions on a Bruker ALPHA FT-IR. Only select IR absorbances are reported. HRMS spectra were recorded on a Bruker microTOFII ESI LCMS using positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) or on an Agilent 6220 ESI TOF mass spectrometer using flow injection analysis. General Analysis of Radiofluorination Reactions Radioactivity was quantified using a Capintec Radioisotope Calibrator (CRC- 712M) ion chamber. Radiochemical incorporation yields were determined by radioTLC. EMD TLC Silica gel 60 plates (10 x 2 cm) were spotted with an aliquot (1 - 5 \iL) of crude reaction mixture approximately 1.5 cm from the bottom of the plate (baseline). Unless otherwise noted, TLC plates were developed in a chamber containing ethyl acetate until within 2 cm of the top of the plate (front). Analysis was performed using a Bioscan AR-2000 radio-TLC imaging scanner and WinScan software. Radiochemical identity and purity were determined by radioHPLC. A Phenomenex Luna CI 8 (250 x 4.6 mm, 5 μιη) or a XSELECT HSS T3 (4.6 x 150 mm, 5 μηι) HPLC column was used with a Waters 1515 Isocratic HPLC Pump equipped with a Waters 2487 Dual λ Absorbance Detector, a Bioscan Flow-Count equipped with a Nal crystal, and Breeze software. Mobile phases included: 70% CH3CN, 30% 0.1 M NH4 HC02(aq), 1 mL/min; 50% CH3CN, 50% 0.1 M H4-HC02(aq), 1 mL/min; and 5% EtOH, 95% 0.1% AcOH(aq), 1 mL/min. In order to account for immobilized radioactivity (which would not be accounted for by radioTLC), reaction vessels were decanted after quenching and residual and solution radioactivity were separately quantified. In all cases, > 95% of radioactivity remained in solution. Specific Activity for Isolated Radioactive Compounds Specific activity was determined by measurement of the UV absorbance of a known amount of radioactivity under identical analytical HPLC conditions used to generate a calibration curve for the corresponding nonradioactive standard. Optimization of Radiofluorination Conditions Radio fluorination conditions were optimized using the biphenyl model substrate with spirocyclopentyl auxiliary (10c) by studying the effects of various solvents, bases, and additives. In general, radiofluorination commenced with heating a solution of spiroiodine(III) precursor (2 mg) and azeotropically dried [18F] fluoride with appropriate base and additive in DMF (400 μί). The reaction mixture was heated at 120 °C for 10 min, followed by the addition of buffer solution (60/40 CH3CN/H2O + 0.1 N ammonium formate, 1 mL) and analyzed by radioTLC and radioHPLC for radiochemical conversion and product identity, respectively. Based on results wherein the base (tetraethylammonium bicarbonate, TEAB) was held constant, DMF was found to be the optimum solvent and was employed for further optimization studies. The choice of base was also crucial, among which TEAB afforded a significantly higher incorporation yield than alkali metal bases. In addition, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-l-piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) and butylated hydro xytoluene (BHT), as radical scavengers, offered no improvement of radio labelling efficiency. As a result, a simple combination of dried [18F] fluoride with TEAB and spiro iodine precursor in DMF was deemed to be the optimal reaction conditions. General Procedure 1 Synthesis of Auxiliary Acids (9 - 10, GP1) General Procedure 1 is based on previously reported synthetic procedures (see e.g., Jiang et al, Chin. J. Chem. 2007, 25, 86-89). A mixture of malonic acid (5.0 g, 48 mmol), acetic anhydride (4.8 mL), and cone. H2SO4 (24 μί) was heated with stirring to 60 °C for 15 min. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature, and an appropriate ketone (48 mmol), was added dropwise over 0.5 - 1 h. The mixture for stirred for an additional 8 h, prior to removal of volatiles by rotary evaporation. The residue was resolubilized in Et20, and washed three times with water. The organics were dried with MgS04, filtered and concentrated. The product was precipitated using Et20 and hexanes, and cooling to -25 °C. General Procedure 2 Oxidation of Aryl Iodides Using Sodium Perborate (GP2) Sodium perborate tetrahydrate (3.85 g, 25 mmol) was added in portions to a 0.15 M solution of aryl iodide (11, 2.5 mmol) in glacial acetic acid (16.7 mL) heated to 50 °C. The reaction mixture was stirred at this temperature for 1 - 6 h, until full conversion of starting materials was determined by TLC. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature, diluted with water, and extracted three times with dichloro methane. The combined organic extracts were dried with anhydrous MgSC^, filtered, and concentrated. The products were purified by recrystallization (often 9: 1 ethyl acetate: acetic anhydride or 9: 1 hexanes: dichloro methane). General Procedure 3 Oxidation of Aryl Iodides Using Urea-Hydrogen Peroxide Adduct (GP3) General Procedure 3 is based on previously reported synthetic procedures (see e.g., Lin et al., J. Org. Chem. 2011, 76, 1013-1030). Powdered urea hydrogen peroxide adduct (1.06 g, 1 1.25 mmol), was added slowly to a solution of glacial acetic acid and acetic anhydride (8:3, 2.5 mL). Aryl iodide (11, 2.5 mmol) was added to obtain a 1 M solution. The solution was cooled to 0 °C in an ice-water bath, followed by slow addition of anhydrous sodium sulfate (410 mg, 5.0 mmol). The reaction mixture was then warmed to 40 °C for 1 - 6 h, until full conversion of starting materials was determined by TLC. The reaction mixture was then diluted with water and extracted three times with dichloro methane. The combined organic extracts were dried with anhydrous MgS04, filtered, and concentrated. The products were purified by recrystallization (often 9: 1 ethyl acetate: acetic anhydride or DCM:hexanes). General Procedure 4 Oxidation of Aryl Iodides Using Trimethylsilyl Acetate and Selectfluor® (GP4) General Procedure 4 is based on previously reported synthetic procedures (see e.g., DiMagno, Processes and reagents for making diaryliodonium salts (2013) and Ye et al, Org. Lett. 2005, 7, 3961-3964). A 0.42 M solution of trimethylsilyl acetate (0.94 mL, 6.25 mmol) in anhydrous acetonitrile (15 mL) was added to a 0.17 M solution of aryl iodide (11, 2.5 mmol) in anhydrous acetonitrile (15 mL), under an atmosphere of Ar(g). Solid l-chloromethyl-4-fluoro-l ,4-diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bis(tetrafiuoroborate) (Selectfluor®)(1.10 g, 3.25 mmol) was then added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 - 8 h, until full conversion of starting materials was determined by TLC. Volatile contents were then removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue was extracted three times with dichloro methane. The combined organic extracts were washed with aqueous acetate buffer (pH 5), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. The products were purified by recrystallization (often 9: 1 ethyl acetate: acetic anhydride or DCM:hexanes). General Procedure 5 One-pot Oxidation of Aryl Iodides Using Potassium peroxymonosulfate and Synthesis of Iodonium Ylides (GP5) General Procedure 5 is based on previously reported synthetic procedures (see e.g., Zagulyaeva et al, J. Org. Chem., 2010, 75, 21 19-2122). Trifluro acetic acid (2.3 mL) was added to a solution of aryl iodide (0.75 mmol) in chloroform (0.75 mL). Potassium peroxymonosulfate (360 mg, 1.2 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 - 4 h, until full conversion of starting materials was determined by TLC. Volatile contents were then removed by rotary evaporation. The dried residue was suspended in ethanol (2 mL) and 6,10-dioxaspiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione (128 mg, 0.75 mmol) was added followed by 10% Na2C03(aq) (w/v, 1.5 mL, 0.33 M solution) . The pH of the reaction mixture was tested and adjusted with Na2C03 until the reaction pH > 10. The reaction mixture was stirred for 5 - 10 h until full conversion of to the iodoinium ylide was determined by TLC. The reaction mixture was then diluted with water, and extracted with chloroform. The chloroform extracts were combined and washed with water (4 x 10 mL) and brine (1 x 10). The organic layer was dried with anhydrous MgS04, filtered, and concentrated. To the residue was added ethyl acetate and hexanes to induce precipitation (at room temperature or -25 °C). Solids were collected by filtration and purified by flash chromatography if necessary. General Procedure 6 One-Pot Oxidation of Aryl Iodides Using mCPBA and Synthesis of Iodonium Ylides (GP6) General Procedure 6 is based on a previously reported synthetic procedures (see e.g., Bielawski et al, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2007, 349, 2610-2618; Chun et al, Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2012, 4541-4547; Cardinale et al, Tetrahedron Lett. 2013, 54, 2067-2069). mCPBA (200 mg, 0.90 mmol, 77% max. content) was added to a solution of aryl iodide (0.70 mmol) in chloroform (8 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1-2 h until full conversion of the starting material was determined by TLC. A solution of 6,10-dioxaspiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione in 10% Na2C03(aq) (w/v, 2 mL, 0.33 M solution) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 1 - 4 h, until full conversion of the starting material was determined by TLC. The reaction mixture was then diluted with water and extracted with chloroform. The combined organic extracts were washed with brine and dried with anhydrous MgS04, filtered and concentrated. To the residue was added ethyl acetate and hexanes to induce precipitation (at room temperature or -25 °C). Solids were collected by filtration and purified by flash chromatography if necessary. General Procedure 7 One-Pot Oxidation of Aryl Iodides Using DMDO and Synthesis of lodonium Ylides (GP7) DMDO in acetone (see e.g., Murray et al, Org. Synth. 1997, 74, 91-96) was added dropwise to an ice-water cooled 0.135 M solution of aryl iodide (0.25 mmol) in acetone and acetic acid (4: 1, v/v, 1.85 mL). The reaction was stirred at 0 °C for 1 h, followed by 3 h at room temperature. Solvent was then removed in vacuo (rotary evaporation, then high vacuum). Ethanol (1 mL) was added to the residue, followed by a solution of auxiliary acid (8 - 10, 0.25 mmol) in 10% Na2C03(aq) (w/v, 0.75 mL, 0.33 M solution). The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 0.5 - 4 h, until full conversion of starting materials was determined by TLC. The reaction mixture was then diluted with water (~ 8 mL), and extracted with DCM (3 x 10 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried with anhydrous Na2S04, filtered, and concentrated. To the residue was added ethyl acetate and hexanes to induce precipitation (at room temperature or -25 °C). Solids were collected by filtration and purified by flash chromatography if necessary. DMDO was not titrated, but estimated to be approximately 80 mM if fresh and as low as 40 mM with heavy usage (see e.g., Adam et al, J. Org. Chem. 1987, 52, 2800- 2803 and Mikula et al, Org. Process Res. Dev. 2013, 17, 313-316). In general, 2 - 5 equiv. DMDO relative aryl iodide were added (about 2.5 - 7.5 mL DMDO solution per mmol aryl iodide). General Procedure 8 Synthesis of lodonium Ylides (GP8) To a solution of the auxiliary acid (8 - 10, 0.25 mmol) in 10% Na2C03(aq) (w/v, 0.75 mL, 0.33 M solution) was added ethanol (1 mL) followed quickly by diacetoxyiodoarene (11, 0.25 mmol). The reaction mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature for 0.5 - 4 h, until full conversion of starting materials was determined by TLC. The reaction mixture was then diluted with water (~ 8 mL), and extracted with DCM (3 x 10 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried with anhydrous Na2S04, filtered, and concentrated. To the residue was added ethyl acetate and hexanes to induce precipitation (at room temperature or -25 °C). Solids were collected by filtration and purified by flash chromatography if necessary. General Procedure 9 Preparation of Radioisotopes A GE PETtrace 16.5 MeV cyclotron was used for [18F]fiuoride production by the 180(p,n)18F nuclear reaction to irradiate 180-enriched water. A GE high yield niobium target containing > 97% enriched 0-18 water (Isotec, Taiyo Nippon Sanso or Rotem) was bombarded with protons at integrated currents up to 65 μΑ to produce [18F] fluoride. [18F]Fluoride was delivered to a lead-shielded hot cell in 180-enriched water by nitrogen gas pressure. [18F]Fluoride was prepared for radio fluorination of aromatics by one of two methods: Method A: A solution of base (e.g., tetraethylammonium bicarbonate, 7 mg) in acetonitrile and water (1 mL, v/v 7:3) was added to an aliquot of target water (< 1 mL) containing the appropriate amount of [18F] fluoride in a V-shaped vial sealed with a teflon- lined septum. The vial was heated to 1 10 °C while nitrogen gas was passed through a P20s-Drierite™ column followed by the vented vial. When no liquid was visible in the vial, it was removed from heat, anhydrous acetonitrile (1 mL) was added, and the heating was resumed until dryness. This step was repeated an additional three times. The vial was then cooled at room temperature under nitrogen pressure. The contents were resolubilized in the desired solvent (e.g., DMF). Method B: An aliquot of target water containing the appropriate amount of [18F]fluoride was slowly passed through an anion exchange cartridge (MP 1 , ORTG, Tennessee, USA), preactivated by flushing with NaHC03(aq) (8.4%, 1 mL) and water (2 - 3 mL, until neutral by pH indicator). [18F]Fluoride was eluted using a solution of base (e.g., tetraethylammonium bicarbonate, 7 mg) in acetonitrile and water (1 mL, v/v 7:3) into a V-shaped vial sealed with a teflon-lined septum. Drying and resolublization were then performed as described above. For preparations involving crypt-222, drying was conducted at 95 °C. General Procedure 10 Radiofluorination of Arenes Azeotropically dried [18F]Et4NF (typically 1 - 3 mCi, 37 - 1 10 MBq), resolubilized in DMF (400 μί), was added to a V-vial containing spiroiodine(III) precursor (13, 2 mg). The reaction was heated at 120 °C for 10 min, and quenched with HPLC buffer (e.g., 60:40 CH3CN:H20 + 0.1 N ammonium formate, 1 mL). Fluorine incorporation and product identities were determined by radio TLC and radioHPLC (n > 3). Conditions were optimized for radiofluorination of 10c to produce [18F]7. Radiofluorination of all other substrates were performed under identical conditions and remain unoptimized. For certain products that were detected in low yield (i.e., 20, 24), a reaction temperature of 150 °C proved superior to the general procedure temperature of 120 °C.

Example 56 Automated Radiosynthesis of [18F]3-fluoro-5-(pyridin-2-ylethynyl)benzonitrile ([18F]FPEB) by GE TracerLab FXFN method Following completion of bombardment, the [18F]fluoride was transferred to the GE TRACERlab™ FXFN radiosynthesis module via helium gas overpressure. A schematic diagram of the GE medical systems commercial TRACERlab™ FXFN radiosynthesis module used for the synthesis of [18F]FPEB is shown in the Figure S3. Automated synthesis involves the following: (1) azeotropic drying of [18F] fluoride; (2) [18F]fluorination; and (3) HPLC purification, followed by solid-phase formulation of the final product. Analyses of radioactive mixtures were performed by HPLC with an in-line UV ((λ = 254 nm) detector in series with a Csl PIN diode radioactivity detector. To determine the identity of [18F]FPEB, aliquots of the formulated product were injected onto an analytical HPLC system using a Novapak CI 8 column, 150 x 4.6 mm, 4 μηι and eluted with 45:55 EtOH/water at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, monitored at λ = 254 nm. The major radiochemical product was identified as [18F]FPEB (tR = 4.7 min; Figure S5). Uncorrected radiochemical yields of [18F]FPEB were 20.0 ± 5% relative to starting [18F] fluoride, and high specific activities were obtained in the final formulation (18 ± 1.4 Ci/μηιοι) (see Figures 9-10). The synthesis module was operated using the following sequences with numerical references to Figure 8: 1. [18F]Fluoride was produced by the 180(p,n)18F nuclear reaction using a GE cyclotron and delivered to the radio synthesis module via 10. The [18F]fluoride was quantitatively trapped on a QMA carbonate ion exchange solid phase extraction (SPE) light cartridge (Waters; activated with 6 mL of trace grade H20). 2. Automated synthesis began with the elution of resin-bound [18F]fluoride using a solution (0.02 M, 0.8 mL) of tetraethylammonium hydrogencarbonate, pre-loaded into 1 and delivered to the reactor (12). 3. The reaction mixture (12) was dried azeotropically by addition of 1 mL anhydrous CH3CN, pre-loaded into 5, at 85 °C under 2 flow and vacuum over 8 min, then at 1 10 °C under N2 flow and vacuum for 4 min. 4. After cooling to 40 °C, ylide precursor (4 mg in 0.5 mL DMF) pre-loaded into 3 was added to 12. The reactor was sealed via the closure of valve VI 3, V20 and V24 and the reaction mixture was heated to 80 °C and this temperature was maintained for 4.5 min. 5. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 40 °C, vented via valves V24 and V25, and diluted with 20:80 CH3CN/20 mM ammonium acetate (2 mL), pre-loaded into 6. 6. The crude reaction mixture was eluted into 14 and the contents of 14 were transferred to the HPLC loop via 2 pressure via a fluid detector, injected onto a semi- preparative column (X-Select HSS T3, 250 x 10.00 mm, 5 μΜ), and eluted with 45:55 CH3CN/2O mM ammonium acetate by volume (pH 6) at a flow rate of 4 mL/min. The eluent was monitored by UV (λ = 254 nm) and radiochemical detectors connected in series. 7. A typical semi-preparative HPLC chromatogram is shown in Figure 9. The fraction containing the major radiochemical product (/R = 19 min) was collected, via valve 18, into a large dilution vessel (15), which was preloaded with 20 mL of sterile water for injection (United States Pharmacopeia (USP); Hospira). 8. The diluted HPLC fraction was then loaded onto a CI 8 light SPE cartridge (16) (Waters; pre-activated with 5 mL EtOH followed by 10 mL H2O). 9. Cartridge, 16 was washed with 10 mL sterile water for injection, USP, preloaded into 7, to remove traces of salts, CH3CN, and [18F]fiuoride. 10. Then 16 was eluted with 1 mL dehydrated alcohol for injection, USP (Ethanol) preloaded into 8, into collection vial 17 followed by 10 mL 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP preloaded into 9. 1 1. The solution was transferred and passed through a 0.22 μηι Millipore GV sterilizing filter (EMD Millipore) into a vented sterile 30 mL dose vial (Hospira). Example A.

Radiochemical Identity, Radiochemical Purity, Injectable Mass and Specific Activity To determine the identity of [18F]FPEB, aliquots of the formulated product were injected onto an analytical HPLC system using a Novapak CI 8 column, 150 x 4.6 mm, 4 μπι and eluted with 45:55 EtOH/water at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, monitored at λ = 254 nm. After completion of the chromatograph, peaks on UV and radioactivity detector were integrated and the radiochemical and chemical purity were determined by the area of integration. The major radiochemical product was identified as [18F]FPEB (/R ~4.9 min; Figure 10), followed by co-injection with the reference standard FPEB. The retention time of [18F]FPEB was compared to that of the standard [19F]FPEB and was within ±10% error. The radiochemical purity was >99% and chemical purity was >98%. Allowed injectable mass are as follows: <3.6 μg and <0.36 μg of unknown chemical impurities. Specific activity was determined using standard FPEB specific activity calibration curve. Specific activity must be >800 mCi per micromole at time of administration. Residual Solvent Analysis Residual solvent assay was performed to verify that residual solvents from in the synthesis and maintenance of the synthesis units are within acceptable limits. Gas chromatography (GC) was used to determine the solvent residue and the results met the following specifications. DMF (Class II) <0.88 mg/mL; Acetone (Class III) <5 mg/mL; Acetonitrile (Class II) <0.4 mg/mL; Ethanol (Class III) <10% v/v ± 10% (formulation agent). pH Assay The pH of [18F]FPEB was determined by applying a few drops of the dose to pH indicator paper. Match the reference color and the pH value conformed to our release specifications (pH = 4.5 - 8.5). Sterile Filter Integrity Test Sterile filter integrity test was performed as per manufacturer specification and the pressure and was > 50 psi for the Millipore Millex GV 0.22 μηι sterilizing filter. Radionuclidic ID - Photopeak and Half-Life Measure the radioactivity of the formulated product at two separated time points. The half-life consistently met our release specifications (105-1 15 minutes). Photopeak was determined based on the following protocol: Introduce small amount of radioactivity of formulated product into gamma spectrometer. Record the spectrum and integrate the areas under the signals of the spectrum. The result was >99.5% emission @ 511 KeV, 1.022 MeV. Endotoxin Analysis Endotoxin analysis was performed on a Charles River Laboratories Endosafe PTS system using a 1 : 100 dilution. Doses contained < 5 EU/mL per injected dose Sterility Testing Sterility testing was performed post-release and must be started within 30 hours from end of synthesis.
