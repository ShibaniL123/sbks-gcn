Novembre 9th, 2012 Caroline Ouimet Self Adhering Boot Shapers Device My boot shapers have the following properties/attributes: 1- To preserve and support the shape of the boot during storage seasons (prevent creasing caused by tilting/collapsing boots and to support boots to allow the ankle and the calf to retain their proper shape) all the while joining the two boots together by a self adhering means. 2- To hold both boots together without flattening or crushing the upper part of the boot which is often adorned by decorations and additional material. 3- The self adhering mechanisms allows the support of each boot individually and/or/as well as attached together. Allowing each individual boot to retain their shape and have support whether attached or unattached as a pair. 4- The boot shapers can fit all boots regardless of their height, size and design (ankle booties, mid calf, below the knee, above the knee). 5- The boot shapers double as a boot carrier with the handles fitted on the top of the shaper. When inserted in the boots, the shapers protrude allowing the user to grip the handles and carry the boots firmly attached to one another. 6- The shapers are built to compress and conform to fit a wide variety of calf sizes in boots (narrow to rounder shaped calves boot designs), they adjust to provide maximum contact between the supports and the boots. 7- The shapers are decorative, when inserted in boots, the section that protrudes is visually pleasing encouraging one to store their boots in plain view when not being worn. 1. A boot shaper comprising:A first elliptical end and a second elliptical end;A front surface extending longitudinally between the first end and the second end in a straight manner, the front surface having a first longitudinal edge and a second longitudinal edge, the front surface being curved about a longitudinal axis;A rear surface extending longitudinally between the first end and the second end in a curved manner, the rear surface having a first longitudinal edge and a second longitudinal edge, the rear surface curved about a longitudinal axis;A first side extending longitudinally from the first end to the second end, the first side smoothly and continuously connecting the first longitudinal edge of the front surface to the first longitudinal edge of the rear surface; andA second side extending longitudinally from the first end to the second end, the second side smoothly and continuously connecting the second longitudinal edge of the front surface to the second longitudinal edge of the rear surface. 2.
