Example 46: Synthesis of compound 11215, N-(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-1-(methylsulfonyl)-N-phenylpiperidine-4-carboxamide
N-(4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)-N-phenylpiperidine-4-carboxamide hydrochloride (0.050 g, 0.107 mmol), synthesized in step 3 of Example 39, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.037 mL, 0.214 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (4 mL) at room temperature, and methanesulfonyl chloride (0.009 mL, 0.118 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent, and the concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 4 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = 5% to 70%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.030 g, 55.1%) as a white solid.
