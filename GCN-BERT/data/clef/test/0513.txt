BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a coryneform bacterium that is able to efficiently produce a heterologous protein by secretion, and a method for secretory production of a heterologous protein. 2. Brief Description of the Related Art To date, secretory production of heterologous proteins by microorganisms has been reported in Bacillus bacterium (Microbiol. rev., 57, 109-137 (1993)), methanol-assimilating yeast, Pichia pastoris (Biotechnol., 11, 905-910 (1993)), filamentous fungi of the genus Aspergillus (Biotechnol., 6, 1419-1422 (1988) and Biotechnol., 9, 976-981 (1991)), and so forth. Secretory production of heterologous proteins by coryneform bacteria has also been reported, specifically secretion of a nuclease and a lipase by Corynebacterium glutamicum (henceforth also abbreviated as C. glutamicum) (U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,197 and J. Bacteriol., 174, 1854-1861 (1992)), secretion of a protease such as subtilisin (Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 61, 1610-1613 (1995)), secretion of a protein using signal peptides of cell surface layer proteins PS1 and PS2 (also referred to as CspB) of coryneform bacteria (Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kohyo) No. 6-502548), secretion of a fibronectin-binding protein using the signal peptide of PS2 (CspB) (Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 63, 4392-4400 (1997)), secretion of protransglutaminase using signal peptides of cell surface layer proteins PS2 (CspB) and SlpA (also referred to as CspA) of coryneform bacteria (Japanese Patent No. 4320769), secretion of a protein using a variant type secretion system (Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 11-169182), secretion of a protransglutaminase by a variant strain (Japanese Patent No. 4362651), secretion of a protein using a Tat-dependent signal peptide (Japanese Patent No. 4730302), and so forth. Various proteins have been suggested as proteins which could be produced by secretory production; however, in coryneform bacteria, there are no reports of secretory production of any multimeric protein, such as, for example, antibody-related molecules. Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) is a generic term which describes proteins that bind with β-lactam type antibiotics, and as a result, inhibit binding with β-lactam type antibiotics. PBPs are generally membrane-binding proteins, and they are considered essential for cell wall synthesis of eubacteria. PBPs are classified as high molecular weight PBPs (HMW-PBPs) or low molecular weight PBPs (LMW-PBPs), according to their molecular weights. HMW-PBPs are further classified as class A high molecular weight PBPs (class A HMW-PBPs), which have both a transpeptidase activity domain for crosslinking peptidoglycan moieties, and a transglycosylase activity domain for forming a polysaccharide chain from disaccharides, and class B high molecular weight PBPs (class B HMW-PBPs) which have only a transpeptidase activity domain. The findings about PBPs of C. glutamicum are detailed in Mol. Microbiol., 66, 643-57 (2007), Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek, 94, 99-109 (2008), Mol. Microbiol., 9, 97-109 (1993), and J. Biotechnol., 112, 177-193 (2004). In C. glutamicum, at least nine PBP homologues have been found so far. Five of them are HMW-PBPs including two class A HMW-PBPs (PBP1a, PBP1b), and three class B HMW-PBPs (FtsI, PBP2a, PBP2b). It is known that the class A HMW-PBPs of C. glutamicum are responsible for cell extension, and the class B HMW-PBPs are responsible for formation of peptidoglycan of septal walls at the time of cell division. Cell surface layer proteins are proteins constituting the cell surface layers (S-layers) of bacteria and archaea. As the cell surface layer proteins of coryneform bacteria, PS1 and PS2 (CspB) of C. glutamicum (Mol. Microbiol., 9, 97-109 (1993)), SlpA (CspA) of C. stationis (Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kohyo) No. 6-502548), and so forth are known. Regarding PS2 (CspB), for example, amino acid sequences of CspB homologues of 28 strains of C. glutamicum have been reported (J. Biotechnol., 112, 177-193 (2004)). As described above, signal peptides of cell surface layer proteins of coryneform bacteria are utilized in secretory productions of proteins (Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kohyo) No. 6-502548; Japanese Patent No. 4320769, and so forth). However, the relationship between the decrease in the activity of a penicillin-binding protein and/or the decrease in the activity of a cell surface layer protein, and the secretory production of a heterologous protein has not been previously reported. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Aspects to be Achieved by the Invention An aspect of the present invention is to develop a novel technique for improving the ability of a coryneform bacterium to produce a heterologous protein by secretory production, and thereby to provide a coryneform bacterium that produces a heterologous protein by secretory production and a method for secretory production of a heterologous protein using such a bacterium.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS <1> Coryneform Bacterium The present invention provides a coryneform bacterium having an ability to produce a heterologous protein by secretory production, in that the bacterium has been modified to have reduced activities of both a penicillin-binding protein and a cell surface layer protein (henceforth also referred to as the “bacterium of the present invention” or the “coryneform bacterium of the present invention”). The expression that a protein is “secreted” can mean that the protein is transported out of the bacterial cell, that is, extracellularly transported. The expression that a protein is “secreted” of course can include when all the protein molecules are present in the medium in completely free forms, when all the protein molecules are present in the cell surface layer, and/or when some of the protein molecules are present in the medium and some are present in the cell surface layer. That is, the “ability to produce a heterologous protein by secretory production” can refer to an ability of the bacterium of the present invention to secrete the heterologous protein into the medium or the cell surface layer, and allow it to accumulate in the medium or the cell surface layer to such an extent that the heterologous protein can be collected from the medium or the cell surface layer, when the bacterium is cultured in the medium. As for the amount that can be accumulated, for example, 10 μg/L or more, 1 mg/L or more, 100 mg/L or more, or even 1 g/L or more can be possible. Also, the amount that can be accumulated in the cell surface layer can be to such an extent that if the heterologous protein in the cell surface layer is collected and suspended in the same volume of liquid as the medium, the concentration of the heterologous protein in the suspension can be 10 μg/L or more, 1 mg/L or more, 100 mg/L or more. In addition, the term “protein” produced by secretory production can refer to molecules called a peptide or polypeptide. The “heterologous protein” can refer to an exogenous protein relative to the coryneform bacterium that expresses and secretes that protein. The heterologous protein may be, for example, a protein derived from a microorganism, a protein derived from a plant, a protein derived from an animal, a protein derived from a virus, or even a protein with an artificially designed amino acid sequence. The heterologous protein may be a monomer protein or a multimeric protein. The multimeric protein can contain two or more subunits. In the multimer, the subunits may be linked by covalent bonds such as disulfide bonds, linked by non-covalent bonds such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction, or linked by combination of these. The multimer can include one or more intermolecular disulfide bonds. The multimer can be a homo-multimer consisting of a single kind of subunit, or may be a hetero-multimer consisting of two or more kinds of subunits. For the hetero-multimer, it is sufficient that at least one subunit is a heterologous protein. That is, all the subunits may be heterogenous, or only a part of subunits may be heterogenous. Although the heterologous protein may be a secretory protein in nature, or may be a non-secretory protein in nature, it is preferably a secretory protein in nature. Specific examples of the “heterologous protein” are described herein. The heterologous protein can be a single kind of protein, or two or more kinds of proteins. Moreover, when the heterologous protein is a hetero-multimer, only one kind of subunit may be produced, or two or more kinds of subunits may be produced. That is, the “secretory production of the heterologous protein” includes secretory production of all the subunits constituting a target heterologous protein, as well as secretory production of only a part of the subunits constituting a target heterologous protein. The coryneform bacteria are aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and include Corynebacterium bacteria, Brevibacterium bacteria, Microbacterium bacteria, and so forth. The coryneform bacteria include bacteria which have previously been classified into the genus Brevibacterium, but are presently united into the genus Corynebacterium (Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol., 41, 255 (1991)). The coryneform bacteria also include bacteria which have previously been classified into Corynebacterium ammoniagenes but are presently reclassified into Corynebacterium stationis by nucleotide sequence analysis of 16S rRNA and so forth (Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol., 60, 874-879 (2010)). Advantages of using coryneform bacteria include the fact that they inherently secrete an extremely small amount of proteins to the outside of cells compared with fungi, yeasts, and Bacillus bacteria, which are conventionally used for secretory production of proteins, and therefore the purification process of a heterologous protein produced by secretory production can be simplified or eliminated. Another advantage is the fact that they can grow well in a simple medium containing a saccharide, ammonia, mineral salts, etc., and therefore they are excellent in view of cost of medium, culture method, and culture productivity, and so forth. Specific examples of such coryneform bacteria include the following species: Corynebacterium acetoacidophilum Corynebacterium acetoglutamicum Corynebacterium alkanolyticum Corynebacterium callunae Corynebacterium glutamicum Corynebacterium lilium Corynebacterium melassecola Corynebacterium thermoaminogenes (Corynebacterium efficiens) Corynebacterium herculis Brevibacterium divaricatum Brevibacterium flavum Brevibacterium immariophilum Brevibacterium lactofermentum (Corynebacterium glutamicum) Brevibacterium roseum Brevibacterium saccharolyticum Brevibacterium thiogenitalis Corynebacterium ammoniagenes (Corynebacterium stationis) Brevibacterium album Brevibacterium cerinum Microbacterium ammoniaphilum Specific examples of such coryneform bacteria include the following strains: Corynebacterium acetoacidophilum ATCC 13870 Corynebacterium acetoglutamicum ATCC 15806 Corynebacterium alkanolyticum ATCC 21511 Corynebacterium callunae ATCC 15991 Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13020, ATCC 13032, ATCC 13060, ATCC 13869, FERM BP-734 Corynebacterium lilium ATCC 15990 Corynebacterium melassecola ATCC 17965 Corynebacterium thermoaminogenes AJ12340 (FERM BP-1539) Corynebacterium herculis ATCC 13868 Brevibacterium divaricatum ATCC 14020 Brevibacterium flavum ATCC 13826, ATCC 14067, AJ12418 (FERM BP-2205) Brevibacterium immariophilum ATCC 14068 Brevibacterium lactofermentum ATCC 13869 Brevibacterium roseum ATCC 13825 Brevibacterium saccharolyticum ATCC 14066 Brevibacterium thiogenitalis ATCC 19240 Corynebacterium ammoniagenes (Corynebacterium stationis) ATCC 6871, ATCC 6872 Brevibacterium album ATCC 15111 Brevibacterium cerinum ATCC 15112 Microbacterium ammoniaphilum ATCC 15354 These strains are available from, for example, the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Address: 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Md. 20852, P.O. Box 1549, Manassas, Va. 20108, United States of America). That is, each strain is given a unique registration number (www.atcc.org), and can be ordered by using this registration number. The registration number of each strain is listed in the catalogue of the ATCC. In particular, the C. glutamicum AJ12036 strain (FERM BP-734), which was isolated from the wild-type strain C. glutamicum ATCC 13869, as a streptomycin (Sm) resistant mutant strain, is predicted to have a mutation in the functional gene responsible for secretion of proteins, and shows an extremely high secretory production ability for proteins as high as about 2 to 3 times in terms of the accumulated amount of proteins under optimum culture conditions, compared with the parent strain (wild-type strain), and therefore it is preferred as a host bacterium. The AJ12036 strain (FERM BP-734) was originally deposited at the National Institute of Bioscience and Human-Technology, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology (the independent administrative agency, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, International Patent Organism Depositary, Tsukuba Central 6, 1-1, Higashi 1-Chome, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken, 305-8566, Japan) on Mar. 26, 1984 as an international deposit, and assigned an accession number of FERM BP-734. Moreover, a strain having an enhanced ability to produce a protein by secretory production may be selected from coryneform bacteria obtained from such coryneform bacteria as mentioned above as a parent strain by using a mutagenesis method or a genetic recombination method, and used as a host. For example, after a parent strain is treated with ultraviolet irradiation or a chemical mutation agent such as N-methyl-N′-nitrosoguanidine, a strain having an enhanced ability to produce a protein by secretory production can be selected. Furthermore, if a strain obtained by modifying such a strain as mentioned above so that it does not produce a cell surface layer protein as the host, purification of the heterologous protein secreted in the medium becomes easy, and therefore it is particularly preferred. Such modification can be carried out by introducing a mutation into the coding region of the cell surface layer protein or an expression control region thereof, on the chromosome by mutagenesis or genetic recombination. Examples of coryneform bacterium modified so that it does not produce a cell surface layer protein can include the C. glutamicum YDK010 strain (WO2004/029254), which is deficient in a cell surface layer protein PS2, and is derived from C. glutamicum AJ12036 strain (FERM BP-734). The coryneform bacterium having an ability to produce a heterologous protein by secretory production can be obtained by introducing a genetic construct for secretory expression of the heterologous protein into such a coryneform bacterium as mentioned above so that the construct is harbored by the bacterium. That is, the bacterium of the present invention has a genetic construct for secretory expression of a heterologous protein. The “genetic construct for secretory expression of a heterologous protein” and a method for introducing it is described herein. The bacterium of the present invention can be obtained by modifying a coryneform bacterium that is able to produce a heterologous protein by secretory production so that the activity of a penicillin-binding protein and the activity of a cell surface layer protein are reduced. Alternatively, the bacterium of the present invention can also be obtained by modifying a coryneform bacterium so that the activity of a penicillin-binding protein and the activity of a cell surface layer protein are both reduced, and then imparting the ability to produce a heterologous protein by secretory production to the bacterium. Furthermore, the bacterium of the present invention can also be obtained by modifying a coryneform bacterium that inherently has reduced activity of a cell surface layer protein so that the bacterium additionally is able to produce a heterologous protein and the activity of a penicillin-binding protein is reduced. In the present invention, the modification and impartation of the ability for constructing the bacterium of the present invention can be carried out in an arbitrary order. The bacterium of the present invention may be a bacterium obtained from a bacterium that can produce a heterologous protein by secretory production before it is modified so that the activity of a penicillin-binding protein and/or the activity of a cell surface layer protein are reduced. In addition, the bacterium of the present invention may also be a bacterium that cannot produce a heterologous protein by secretory production even when it has a genetic construct for secretory expression of a heterologous protein before it is modified so that the activity of a penicillin-binding protein and/or the activity of a cell surface layer protein are reduced, which is then able to produce the heterologous protein by secretory production as a result of reducing the activity of the penicillin-binding protein and/or the activity of a cell surface layer protein. In addition, the bacterium of the present invention may be further modified so that expression of a gene encoding a metallopeptidase or a gene encoding a protein having a region homologous to a motif of a metallopeptidase is increased. Hereafter, penicillin-binding proteins and genes coding for them will be explained. In general, the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) can refer to proteins that bind with β-lactam type antibiotics, and as a result, inhibit their enzymatic function. The penicillin-binding proteins include high molecular weight PBPs (HMW-PBPs) and low molecular weight PBPs (LMW-PBPs). The high molecular weight PBPs include class A high molecular weight PBPs (class A HMW-PBPs) and class B high molecular weight PBPs (class B HMW-PBPs). The class A HMW-PBPs have both a transpeptidase activity domain for crosslinking peptidoglycan moieties and a transglycosylase activity domain for forming a polysaccharide chain from disaccharides. The class B HMW-PBPs have a transpeptidase activity domain. For example, as for C. glutamicum, PBP1a and PBP1b can be mentioned as the class A HMW-PBPs. As for C. glutamicum, FtsI, PBP2a, and PBP2b can be mentioned as the class B HMW-PBPs. When the activity of a penicillin-binding protein is reduced in a coryneform bacterium, the amount of a heterologous protein produced by secretory production is increased as compared with that observed for a non-modified strain. Examples of a penicillin-binding protein, for example, include PBP 1a, class B HMW-PBPs, and LMW-PBPs, specifically include PBP1a and class B HMW-PBPs, or more specifically include PBP1a. The phrase regarding the “property that if the activity of the protein is reduced in a coryneform bacterium, the amount of a heterologous protein to be produced by secretory production is increased compared with that observed for a non-modified strain” can refer to a property that if the activity of the protein is reduced in a coryneform bacterium, an ability to produce a heterologous protein by secretory production in an amount larger than that observed for a non-modified strain such as wild-type strain or parent strain is imparted to the coryneform bacterium. Although the degree of the increase in amount of the heterologous protein to be produced by secretory production is not particularly limited so long as the amount of the heterologous protein produced by secretory production increases compared with that observed for a non-modified strain, the amount to be produced can mean, for example, 10% or more, 20% or more, 30% or more, 100% or more, in terms of the accumulation amount in the medium and/or the cell surface layer. In addition, to produce a heterologous protein by secretory production in an amount larger than that observed for a non-modified strain may mean that whereas the heterologous protein cannot be detected when non-concentrated culture supernatant of a non-modified strain is applied to SDS-PAGE and stained with CBB, the heterologous protein can be detected when non-concentrated culture supernatant of a modified strain is applied to SDS-PAGE and stained with CBB. Also, the phrase regarding the “property that if the activity of the protein is reduced in a coryneform bacterium, the amount of a heterologous protein to be produced by secretory production is increased compared with that observed for a non-modified strain” regarding a penicillin-binding protein can also include a property that if the activity of the protein is reduced in a strain in which the activity of a cell surface layer protein is not reduced, the ability of the strain to produce a heterologous protein by secretory production is not increased, however, if the activity of the protein is reduced in a strain in which the activity of a cell surface layer protein is reduced, the ability of the strain to produce a heterologous protein by secretory production is increased. Whether a protein has a property that if the activity of the protein is reduced in a coryneform bacterium, the amount of a heterologous protein produced by secretory production is increased compared with that observed for a non-modified strain can be confirmed by modifying a coryneform bacterium so that the activity of the protein is reduced, quantifying the amount of the heterologous protein produced by secretory production observed when the modified strain is cultured in a medium, and comparing the quantified amount with the amount of the heterologous protein produced by secretory production observed when an unmodified strain is cultured in the medium. The Cgl0278 gene coding for the PBP1a protein of the C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 corresponds to a sequence complementary to the sequence of the 294001 to 296388 positions in the genome sequence registered at the NCBI database as GenBank accession BA000036 (VERSION BA000036.3 GI: 42602314). Also, the PBP1a protein of the C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 is registered as GenBank accession NP—599531 (version NP—599531.1 GI: 19551529, locus_tag=“NCgl0274”). The nucleotide sequence of the Cgl0278 gene of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 and the amino acid sequence of the PBP1a protein encoded by this gene are shown as SEQ ID NOS: 81 and 82, respectively. Since a nucleotide sequence of a gene coding for a penicillin-binding protein may differ depending on species or strain to which the coryneform bacterium belongs, the gene coding for a penicillin-binding protein may be a variant of the aforementioned nucleotide sequence, so long as the gene codes for a protein having a property that if the activity of the protein is reduced in a coryneform bacterium, the amount of a heterologous protein to be produced by secretory production is increased compared with that observed for a non-modified strain. In addition, the variant of the Cgl0278 gene includes a homologue of the gene. Homologues of the Cgl0278 gene can be easily obtained from public databases by BLAST search or FASTA search using the wild-type Cgl0278 gene of the aforementioned C. glutamicum as a query sequence, and can also be obtained by PCR using a chromosome of a coryneform bacterium as a template and oligonucleotides prepared on the basis of a known gene sequence such as those mentioned above as primers. The gene coding for a penicillin-binding protein may be a gene coding for a protein having the aforementioned amino acid sequence including substitution, deletion, insertion, or addition of one or several amino acid residues at one or several positions, so long as the gene codes for a protein having a property that if the activity of the protein is reduced in a coryneform bacterium, the amount of a heterologous protein to be produced by secretory production is increased compared with that observed for a non-modified strain. In such a case, usually 70% or more, 80% or more, 90% or more, of the above-defined property that if the activity of the protein is reduced in a coryneform bacterium, the amount of a heterologous protein produced by secretory production is increased compared with that observed for a non-modified strain is maintained based on the same protein but without with the above substitution, deletion, insertion, or addition of one or several amino acid residues. Although the number of the “one or several” amino acid residues may differ depending on the position in the three-dimensional structure or types of amino acid residues of the protein, specifically, it can be 1 to 20, 1 to 10, 1 to 5. The aforementioned substitution, deletion, insertion, or addition of one or several amino acid residues can be a conservative mutation that maintains the normal function of the protein. Typical examples of conservative mutations are conservative substitutions. The conservative substitution can be a mutation wherein substitution takes place mutually among Phe, Trp, and Tyr, if the substitution site is an aromatic amino acid; among Leu, Ile, and Val, if it is a hydrophobic amino acid; between Gln and Asn, if it is a polar amino acid; among Lys, Arg, and His, if it is a basic amino acid; between Asp and Glu, if it is an acidic amino acid; and between Ser and Thr, if it is an amino acid having a hydroxyl group. Examples of substitutions considered as conservative substitutions include, specifically, substitution of Ser or Thr for Ala, substitution of Gln, His, or Lys for Arg, substitution of Glu, Gln, Lys, His, or Asp for Asn, substitution of Asn, Glu, or Gln for Asp, substitution of Ser or Ala for Cys, substitution of Asn, Glu, Lys, His, Asp, or Arg for Gln, substitution of Gly, Asn, Gln, Lys, or Asp for Glu, substitution of Pro for Gly, substitution of Asn, Lys, Gln, Arg, or Tyr for His, substitution of Leu, Met, Val, or Phe for Ile, substitution of Ile, Met, Val, or Phe for Leu, substitution of Asn, Glu, Gln, His, or Arg for Lys, substitution of Ile, Leu, Val, or Phe for Met, substitution of Trp, Tyr, Met, Ile, or Leu for Phe, substitution of Thr or Ala for Ser, substitution of Ser or Ala for Thr, substitution of Phe or Tyr for Trp, substitution of His, Phe, or Trp for Tyr, and substitution of Met, Ile, or Leu for Val. Furthermore, such substitution, deletion, insertion, addition, inversion or the like of amino acid residues as mentioned above can include a naturally occurring mutation due to an individual difference, or a difference of species of a bacterium from which the gene is derived (mutant or variant). Furthermore, the gene having such a conservative mutation as mentioned above may be a gene coding for a protein having a homology of 80% or more, 90% or more, 95% or more, 97% or more, 99% or more, to the total encoded amino acid sequence and having a property that if the activity of the protein is reduced in a coryneform bacterium, the amount of a heterologous protein produced by secretory production is increased compared with that observed for a non-modified strain. In addition, in this specification, “homology” may mean “identity”. Moreover, the gene coding for a penicillin-binding protein may be a DNA that is able to hybridize with a probe that can be prepared from a known gene sequence, for example, a sequence complementary to a part or all of the aforementioned nucleotide sequence, under stringent conditions, and coding for a protein having a property that if the activity of the protein is reduced in a coryneform bacterium, the amount of a heterologous protein to be produced by secretory production is increased compared with that observed for a non-modified strain. The “stringent conditions” can refer to conditions under which a so-called specific hybrid is formed, and a non-specific hybrid is not formed. Examples of the stringent conditions include those under which highly homologous DNAs hybridize to each other, for example, DNAs not less than 80% homologous, not less than 90% homologous, not less than 95% homologous, not less than 97% homologous, not less than 99% homologous, hybridize to each other, and DNAs less homologous than the above do not hybridize to each other, or conditions of a typical Southern hybridization, i.e., conditions of washing once, preferably 2 or 3 times, at a salt concentration and temperature corresponding to 1×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60° C., 0.1×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60° C., or 0.1×SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68° C. The probe used for the aforementioned hybridization may be a part of a sequence that is complementary to the gene as described above. Such a probe can be prepared by PCR using oligonucleotides prepared on the basis of a known gene sequence as primers and a DNA fragment containing the nucleotide sequence as a template. For example, when a DNA fragment having a length of about 300 bp is used as the probe, the washing conditions of the hybridization may be, for example, 50° C., 2×SSC and 0.1% SDS. In addition, the aforementioned explanations concerning variants of genes and proteins can also be applied mutatis mutandis to arbitrary proteins such as a cell surface layer protein and a heterologous protein to be produced by secretory production in the present invention, and genes coding for them. Hereafter, cell surface layer proteins and genes coding for them will be explained. The cell surface layer proteins are proteins constituting the cell surface layers (S-layer) of bacteria and archaea. Examples of the cell surface layer proteins of coryneform bacteria can include PS1 and PS2 (also referred to as CspB) of C. glutamicum and SlpA (also referred to as CspA) of C. stationis. Among them, it is preferred that the activity of PS2 protein is reduced. The nucleotide sequence of the cspB gene of C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 and the amino acid sequence of the PS2 protein encoded by this gene are shown as SEQ ID NOS: 97 and 98, respectively. Also, for example, amino acid sequences of CspB homologues regarding 28 strains of C. glutamicum have been reported (J. Biotechnol., 112, 177-193 (2004)). These 28 strains of C. glutamicum and the GenBank accession numbers of the cspB gene homologues in NCBI database are exemplified below (the GenBank accession numbers are shown in the parentheses). C. glutamicum ATCC13058 (AY524990) C. glutamicum ATCC13744 (AY524991) C. glutamicum ATCC13745 (AY524992) C. glutamicum ATCC14017 (AY524993) C. glutamicum ATCC14020 (AY525009) C. glutamicum ATCC14067 (AY524994) C. glutamicum ATCC14068 (AY525010) C. glutamicum ATCC14747 (AY525011) C. glutamicum ATCC14751 (AY524995) C. glutamicum ATCC14752 (AY524996) C. glutamicum ATCC14915 (AY524997) C. glutamicum ATCC15243 (AY524998) C. glutamicum ATCC15354 (AY524999) C. glutamicum ATCC17965 (AY525000) C. glutamicum ATCC17966 (AY525001) C. glutamicum ATCC19223 (AY525002) C. glutamicum ATCC19240 (AY525012) C. glutamicum ATCC21341 (AY525003) C. glutamicum ATCC21645 (AY525004) C. glutamicum ATCC31808 (AY525013) C. glutamicum ATCC31830 (AY525007) C. glutamicum ATCC31832 (AY525008) C. glutamicum LP-6 (AY525014) C. glutamicum DSM20137 (AY525015) C. glutamicum DSM20598 (AY525016) C. glutamicum DSM46307 (AY525017) C. glutamicum 22220 (AY525005) C. glutamicum 22243 (AY525006) Since nucleotide sequence of a gene coding for a cell surface layer protein may differ depending on species or strain to which the coryneform bacterium belongs, the gene coding for a cell surface layer protein may be a variant of the aforementioned nucleotide sequence, so long as the gene codes for a protein having a property that if the activity of the protein is reduced in a coryneform bacterium, the amount of a heterologous protein produced by secretory production is increased compared with that observed for a non-modified strain. For example, the gene coding for a cell surface layer protein may be a gene coding for a protein having the aforementioned amino acid sequence including substitution, deletion, insertion, or addition of one or several amino acid residues at one or several positions, so long as the gene codes for a protein having a property that if the activity of the protein is reduced in a coryneform bacterium, the amount of a heterologous protein produced by secretory production is increased compared with that observed for a non-modified strain. The aforementioned explanations concerning variants of a penicillin-binding protein and a gene encoding it can also be applied mutatis mutandis to variants of a cell surface layer protein and a gene encoding it. Also, the phrase regarding the “property that if the activity of the protein is reduced in a coryneform bacterium, the amount of a heterologous protein to be produced by secretory production is increased compared with that observed for a non-modified strain” regarding a cell surface layer protein can include when the activity of the protein is reduced and the penicillin-binding protein activity is not reduced, the ability of the strain to produce a heterologous protein by secretory production is not increased. However, when the activity of the protein is reduced in a strain in which the activity of a penicillin-binding protein is also reduced, the ability of the strain to produce a heterologous protein by secretory production can be increased. The expression “activity of a cell surface layer protein is reduced” or “reduced activity of a cell surface layer protein” can include the situation when a coryneform bacterium has been modified so that the activity of a cell surface layer protein is reduced, and when the activity of a cell surface layer protein is inherently reduced in a coryneform bacterium. The “case where the activity of a cell surface layer protein is inherently reduced in a coryneform bacterium” can include when a coryneform bacterium is inherently deficient in a cell surface layer protein. That is, examples of a coryneform bacterium in which the activity of a cell surface layer protein is reduced can include a coryneform bacterium that is inherently deficient in a cell surface layer protein. Examples of the “case where a coryneform bacterium is inherently deficient in a cell surface layer protein” can include when a coryneform bacterium is inherently deficient in a gene encoding a cell surface layer protein. The expression “a coryneform bacterium is inherently deficient in a cell surface layer protein” can mean that a coryneform bacterium is inherently deficient in one or more proteins selected from cell surface layer protein(s) found in other strain(s) of the species to which the coryneform bacterium belongs. For example, “C. glutamicum is inherently deficient in a cell surface layer protein” can mean that a C. glutamicum strain is inherently deficient in one or more proteins selected from cell surface layer protein(s) found in other C. glutamicum strain(s), i.e. for example, deficient in PS1 and/or PS2 (CspB). Examples of the coryneform bacterium that is inherently deficient in a cell surface layer protein include C. glutamicum ATCC 13032, which is inherently deficient in the cspB gene. Hereafter, means for reducing the activity of a protein will be explained. The expression “activity of a protein is reduced” or “reduced activity” can mean that the activity of the target protein is decreased compared with that of a non-modified strain such as a wild-type strain or parent strain, which includes when the activity completely disappears. Specifically, the expression “activity of a protein is reduced” can mean that the number of molecules of the protein per cell is reduced, and/or the function of each molecule of the protein is reduced compared with those of a non-modified strain. That is, the term “activity” regarding the expression “activity of a protein is reduced” can mean the transcription amount (the amount of mRNA) of a gene encoding the protein or the amount of the protein, as well as the catalytic activity of the protein. In addition, the case where “number of molecules of the protein per cell is reduced” includes when the protein does not exist at all. Further, the case where “function of each molecule of the protein is reduced” includes when the function of each molecule of the protein completely disappears. The modification for reducing the activity of a protein can be attained by, for example, reducing expression of a gene coding for the protein. “Reduction of gene expression” can also be referred to as “attenuation of gene expression”. The reduction of gene expression may be induced by, for example, reduction of transcription efficiency, reduction of translation efficiency, or a combination of these. Reduction of expression of a gene can be attained by modifying an expression control sequence of the gene such as a promoter and the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence. When an expression control sequence is modified, one nucleotide or more, two nucleotides or more, or three nucleotides or more, of the expression control sequence can be modified. Moreover, a part or all of the expression control sequence may be deleted. Reduction of gene expression can also be attained by, for example, manipulating a factor responsible for expression control. Examples of the factor responsible for expression control include low molecules responsible for transcription or translation control (inducers, inhibitors, etc.), proteins responsible for transcription or translation control (transcription factors etc.), nucleic acids responsible for transcription or translation control (siRNA etc.), and so forth. The modification for reducing the activity of a protein can also be attained by, for example, disrupting the gene coding for the protein. Disruption of a gene can be attained by, for example, deleting a part or all of the coding region of the gene on a chromosome. Furthermore, the total gene including sequences upstream and downstream from the gene on a chromosome may be deleted. The region to be deleted may be any region such as an N-terminus region, an internal region, or a C-terminus region, so long as reduction of the activity of the protein is attained. Deletion of a longer region can usually more surely inactivate the gene. Further, it is preferred that the reading frames of the sequences upstream and downstream from the region to be deleted are not the same. Disruption of a gene can also be attained by, for example, introduction of a mutation for an amino acid substitution (missense mutation), a stop codon (nonsense mutation), a frame shift mutation which adds or deletes one or two nucleotides into the coding region of the gene on a chromosome, or the like (Journal of Biological Chemistry, 272:8611-8617 (1997); Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA, 95 5511-5515 (1998); Journal of Biological Chemistry, 26 116, 20833-20839 (1991)). Disruption of a gene can also be attained by, for example, inserting another sequence into the coding region of the gene on a chromosome. Site of the insertion may be any region of the gene, and insertion of a longer region can usually more surely inactivate the gene. It is preferred that the reading frames of the sequences upstream and downstream from the insertion site are not the same. The other sequence is not particularly limited so long as a sequence that reduces or eliminates the activity of the encoded protein is chosen, and examples include, for example, a marker gene such as an antibiotic resistance gene, a gene useful for production of a heterologous protein, and so forth. Such modification of a gene on a chromosome as described above can be attained by, for example, preparing a deficient type gene in which a partial sequence of the gene is deleted so that it cannot produce a protein that can normally function, and transforming a bacterium with a recombinant DNA containing the deficient type gene to cause homologous recombination between the deficient type gene and the gene on a chromosome and thereby substituting the deficient type gene for the gene on the chromosome. In such a case, if a marker gene selected according to the characteristics of the host such as auxotrophy is included in the recombinant DNA, the operation becomes easy. The protein encoded by the deficient type gene has a conformation different from that of a wild-type protein, even if it is produced, and thus the function thereof can be reduced or eliminated. Such gene disruption based on gene substitution utilizing homologous recombination has been already established, and include methods called “Red driven integration” (Datsenko, K. A, and Wanner, B. L., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 97:6640-6645 (2000)), a method of using a linear DNA such as by utilizing the Red driven integration in combination with an excision system derived from λ phage (Cho, E. H., Gumport, R. I., Gardner, J. F., J. Bacteriol., 184:5200-5203 (2002)), a method of using a plasmid containing a temperature sensitive replication origin, a method of using a plasmid capable of conjugative transfer, a method of using a suicide vector not having replication origin which functions in a host (U.S. Pat. No. 6,303,383, Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 05-007491), and so forth. The modification for reducing the activity of a protein can also be attained by, for example, a mutagenesis treatment. Examples of the mutagenesis treatment include usual mutagenesis treatments such as irradiation of X-ray or ultraviolet radiation and mutagenesis treatment with a mutation agent such as N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Reduction of the activity of a target protein can be confirmed by measuring the activity of the protein. In the case of a penicillin-binding protein, whether the activity of the protein has been reduced can be confirmed by, for example, measuring the transpeptidase activity and/or the transglycosylase activity depending on the class to which the protein belongs. The transpeptidase activity and/or the transglycosylase activity can be measured by, for example, a method well known to those skilled in the art. Specifically, for example, the transpeptidase and transglycosylase activities of PBP1a can be measured by measuring the reaction of oligomerizing lipid II to glycan strands and forming peptide cross-links (Born P, et al., J Biol. Chem. 2006 Sep. 15; 281(37): 26985-93.). Specifically, the activity of a protein can be decreased by, for example, 50% or less, 20% or less, 10% or less, 5% or less, or even 0%, of that observed in a non-modified strain. Reduction of expression of a target gene can be confirmed by confirming reduction of the transcription amount of the gene or reduction of the amount of the target protein expressed from the gene. Reduction of the transcription amount of a target gene can be confirmed by comparing the amount of mRNA transcribed from the gene with that observed in a non-modified strain. Examples of the method for measuring the amount of mRNA include Northern hybridization, RT-PCR, and so forth (Molecular Cloning, Cold spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor (USA), 2001). The amount of mRNA can be decreased by, for example, 50% or less, 20% or less, 10% or less, 5% or less, or 0%, of that observed in a non-modified strain. Reduction of the amount of a target protein can be confirmed by Western blotting using antibodies that bind to the protein (Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor (USA) 2001). The amount of the protein can be decreased by, for example, 50% or less, 20% or less, 10% or less, 5% or less, or 0%, of that observed in a non-modified strain. Disruption of a target gene can be confirmed by determining nucleotide sequence or restriction enzyme map of a part or all of the gene, full length of the gene, or the like depending on the means used for the disruption. The methods mentioned above for reducing the activity of a protein can also be applied mutatis mutandis to arbitrary proteins and genes coding for them as well as for reducing the activity of a penicillin-binding protein and reducing the activity of a cell surface layer protein. Hereafter, the “genetic construct for secretory expression of a heterologous protein” and a method for introducing it will be explained. It is known that a secretory protein is generally translated as a preprotein (also referred to as prepeptide) or preproprotein (also referred to as prepropeptide), and then becomes a mature protein through processing. Specifically, a secretory protein is generally translated as a preprotein or preproprotein, then a signal peptide as the pre-part is cleaved with a protease (generally called signal peptidase), and the secretory protein is thereby converted into a mature protein or proprotein. As for the proprotein, the pro-part thereof is further cleaved by a protease, and the proprotein thereby becomes a mature protein. Hence, it is preferable to use a signal peptide for the secretory production of a heterologous protein. A preprotein and a preproprotein of a secretory protein may be collectively referred to as “secretory protein precursor”. The “signal peptide” (also referred to as “signal sequence”) can refer to an amino acid sequence present at the N-terminus of a secretory protein precursor, and usually not present in a natural mature protein. Although the genetic construct is not particularly limited so long as secretory production of the heterologous protein is attained, it can contain a promoter sequence that functions in a coryneform bacterium, a nucleic acid sequence coding for a signal peptide that is ligated downstream from the promoter sequence and functions in the coryneform bacterium, and a nucleic acid sequence coding for the heterologous protein that is ligated downstream from the nucleic acid sequence coding for the signal peptide. The nucleic acid sequence coding for a signal peptide may be ligated downstream from the promoter sequence so that the signal peptide is expressed under the control of the promoter. The nucleic acid sequence coding for the heterologous protein may be ligated downstream from the nucleic acid sequence coding for the signal peptide so that the heterologous protein is expressed as a fusion protein with the signal peptide. The genetic construct can also contain a control sequence (operator, terminator, etc.) effective for expression of the heterologous protein gene in a coryneform bacterium at such an appropriate position that it can function. The promoter is not particularly limited so long as a promoter that functions in a coryneform bacterium is chosen, and it may be a promoter derived from a coryneform bacterium, or a heterogenous promoter. The “promoter that functions in a coryneform bacterium” can refer to a promoter that has a promoter activity in a coryneform bacterium. Specific examples of the heterogenous promoter include, for example, promoters derived from E. coli such as tac promoter, lac promoter, trp promoter, and araBAD promoter. Among these, potent promoters such as tac promoter are preferred, and inducible promoters such as araBAD promoter are also preferred. Examples of the promoter derived from a coryneform bacterium include, for example, promoters of the cell surface layer proteins PS1, PS2 (also referred to as CspB), and SlpA (also referred to as CspA), and promoters of various amino acid biosynthesis system genes. Specific examples of the promoters of various amino acid biosynthesis system genes include, for example, promoters of the glutamate dehydrogenase gene of the glutamic acid biosynthesis system, the glutamine synthetase gene of the glutamine synthesis system, the aspartokinase gene of the lysine biosynthesis system, the homoserine dehydrogenase gene of the threonine biosynthesis system, the acetohydroxy acid synthetase gene of the isoleucine and valine biosynthesis system, 2-isopropylmalate synthetase gene of the leucine biosynthesis system, the glutamate kinase gene of the proline and arginine biosynthesis system, the phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphorylase gene of the histidine biosynthesis system, the deoxyarabinoheptulosonate phosphate (DAHP) synthetase gene of the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis systems such as those of tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine, the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) amidotransferase gene of the nucleic acid biosynthesis systems such as those of inosinic acid and guanylic acid, the inosinic acid dehydrogenase gene, and the guanylic acid synthetase gene. As the promoter, a high activity type of an existing promoter may be obtained by using various reporter genes and used. For example, by making the −35 and −10 regions in a promoter region closer to a consensus sequence, the activity of the promoter can be enhanced (International Patent Publication WO00/18935). Examples of method for evaluating strength of a promoter and strong promoters are described in the paper of Goldstein et al. (Prokaryotic promoters in biotechnology, Biotechnol. Annu. Rev., 1, 105-128 (1995)) and so forth. Additionally, it is known that substitution, insertion, or deletion of several nucleotides in a spacer region between the ribosome-binding site (RBS) and the translation initiation codon, especially a sequence immediately upstream from the initiation codon (5′-UTR), greatly affects stability of mRNA and translation efficiency of mRNA, and therefore, this sequence can be modified. The signal peptide is not particularly limited so long as a signal peptide that functions in the coryneform bacterium is chosen, and it may be a signal peptide derived from the coryneform bacterium, or it may be a heterogenous signal peptide. The “signal peptide that functions in the coryneform bacterium” can refer to a peptide that, when it is ligated to the N-terminus of an objective protein, allows the coryneform bacterium to secrete the protein. The signal peptide can be a signal peptide of a secretory protein of the coryneform bacterium as the host, or a signal peptide of a cell surface layer protein of the coryneform bacterium. Examples of the cell surface layer protein of coryneform bacteria include PS1 and PS2 (CspB) derived from C. glutamicum (Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kohyo) No. 6-502548), and SlpA (CspA) derived from C. ammoniagenes (C. stationis) (Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 10-108675). The amino acid sequence of the signal peptide of PS1 is shown as SEQ ID NO: 83, the amino acid sequence of the signal peptide of PS2 (CspB) is shown as SEQ ID NO: 84, and the amino acid sequence of the signal peptide of SlpA (CspA) is shown as SEQ ID NO: 85. Moreover, U.S. Pat. No. 4,965,197 describes that there are signal peptides for DNases derived from coryneform bacteria, and such signal peptides can also be used for the present invention. Although signal peptides have a certain characteristic of sequence common over biological species, a signal peptide that exhibits a secretory function in a certain biological species does not necessarily exhibit a secretory function in another biological species. Therefore, when a heterogenous signal peptide is used, a signal peptide that functions in the coryneform bacterium may be appropriately chosen. Whether a certain signal peptide functions in the coryneform bacterium can be confirmed by, for example, expressing the objective protein as a fusion protein with that signal peptide, and confirming whether the protein is secreted or not. The signal peptide may include a part of N-terminus amino acid sequence of the secretory protein from which the signal peptide is derived. The signal sequence is generally cleaved by a signal peptidase, when the translation product is secreted out of the cell. In addition, as a gene coding for a signal peptide, although a naturally occurring gene may be used as it is, it may be modified so that it has the optimal codons according to codon frequencies in the chosen host. Examples of the heterologous protein produced by secretory production by the method of the present invention include, for example, bioactive proteins, receptor proteins, antigenic proteins which can be used as vaccines, and enzymes. Examples of the enzymes include, for example, transglutaminases, proteases, endopeptidases, exopeptidases, aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, collagenases, chitinases, and so forth. Examples of the bioactive proteins include, for example, growth factors, hormones, cytokines, antibody-related molecules. Specific examples of the growth factor include, for example, Epidermal growth factor (EGF), Insulin-like growth factor (IGF), Transforming growth factor (TGF), Nerve growth factor (NGF), Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Vesicular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), Granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), Erythropoietin (EPO), Thrombopoietin (TPO), acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF or FGF1), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF2), keratinocyto growth factor (KGF-1 or FGF7, and KGF-2 or FGF10), and Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Specific examples of the hormone include, for example, insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, human growth hormone (hGH), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcitonin Specific examples of the cytokine include, for example, interleukins, interferons, tumor necrosis factors (TNFs). Growth factors, hormones, and cytokines may not be strictly distinguished from each other. For example, a bioactive protein may be a protein such as a growth factor, hormone, and cytokine, or may be a protein that is classified as more than one of these. A bioactive protein may be an intact protein, or may be a part of a protein. Examples of a part of a protein include, for example, a part having physiological activity. Specific examples of a part having physiological activity include, for example, Teriparatide, a bioactive peptide, which consists of 34 amino acid residues of N-terminus of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The antibody-related molecule can refer to a protein that includes a single domain or a combination of two or more domains, such as domains that constitute a complete antibody. Examples of the domains that constitute a complete antibody include VH, CH1, CH2, and CH3, which are domains of a heavy chain, and VL and CL, which are domains of a light chain. The antibody-related molecule may be a monomer protein or a multimeric protein so long as it includes the above-mentioned molecular species. In the case where the antibody-related molecule is a multimeric protein, the antibody-related molecule may be a homo-multimer consisting of a single kind of subunit, or may be a hetero-multimer consisting of two or more kinds of subunits. Specific examples of the antibody-related molecule include, for example, complete antibodies, Fab, F(ab′), F(ab′)2, Fc, dimer consisting of the heavy chain (H chain) and the light chain (L chain), Fc-fusion proteins, the heavy chain (H chain), the light chain (L chain), single chain Fv (scFv), sc(Fv)2, disulfide-linked Fv (sdFv), and diabody. The receptor protein is not particularly limited, and can be, for example, a receptor protein for any of the bioactive proteins and other bioactive substances. Examples of other bioactive substances can include, for example, neurotransmitters such as dopamine. In addition, the receptor protein can also be an orphan receptor, of which ligand has not been identified. The antigenic protein which can be used as a vaccine is not particularly limited so long as it is a protein which causes an immune response, and the antigenic protein can be appropriately chosen according to the intended target of the immune response. Specific examples of the monomer protein include, for example, transglutaminases and the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Examples of transglutaminase gene include genes of secretory transglutaminases of actinomycetes such as Streptoverticillium mobaraense IFO 13819, Streptoverticillium cinnamoneum IFO 12852, Streptoverticillium griseocarneum IFO 12776, Streptomyces lydicus [WO9606931], filamentous fungi such as Oomycetes [WO96/22366], and so forth. In addition, specific examples of the monomer protein further include monomer proteins as the antibody-related molecules, for example, the heavy chain (H chain), the light chain (L chain), scFv, and sdFv. Further, specific examples of the multimeric protein include, for example, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin, interleukin-5, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factors (TNFs). In addition, specific examples of the multimeric protein further include multimeric proteins as the antibody-related molecules, for example, complete antibodies, Fab, F(ab′), F(ab′)2, Fc, dimer consisting of the heavy chain (H chain) and the light chain (L chain), Fc-fusion proteins, sc(Fv)2, and diabody. Among these, Fab, F(ab′)2, and Fc-fusion proteins are preferred. Fab (fragment, antigen binding) is a part of a complete antibody except for the Fc region of the H chain, and it is an antibody fragment consisting only of an antigen-binding region. Fab is a dimer consisting of one molecule of the Fab moiety of the H chain and one molecule of L chain, and they aggregate by a disulfide bond at the C-terminus. The complete antibody is an H2L2 tetramer, and has a huge molecular weight of about 150 kDa, whereas Fab has a small molecular weight of about 50 kDa, and therefore Fab is thought to show superior permeability for an objective tissue. Since Fab does not have the Fc region, it has neither the complement activity nor crystallization ability, but since it has antigen-binding ability, it is mainly used for the purpose of neutralizing an antigen. Among the antibody drugs, Fab especially attracts attention in recent years. F(ab′) is a part of a complete antibody except for the Fc′ region of the H chain. F(ab′) is a dimer consisting of one molecule of the F(ab′) moiety of the H chain and one molecule of the L chain, and they aggregate by a disulfide bond at the C-terminus The reminder moiety of the H chain in F(ab′) is longer than the reminder moiety of the H chain in Fab, and hence, in F(ab′), the disulfide bond moiety linking the H chains remains. Therefore, two molecules of F(ab′) can form F(ab′)2 by a disulfide bond. F(ab′) and F(ab′)2 can also be used as antibody drugs like a Fab fragment. Fc (fragment, crystallizable) is an antibody fragment consisting only of the Fc region that participates in the complement activity and crystallization ability. A protein consisting of the Fc region of the H chain and another functional protein fused to each other is called an Fc-fusion protein. Genes coding for these proteins can be modified according to the chosen host and to obtain a desired activity. For example, the genes coding for these proteins may be modified so that the proteins include addition, deletion, substitution, or the like of one or several amino acid residues. The explanations concerning variants of the penicillin-binding proteins and the genes coding for them mentioned above can also be applied mutatis mutandis to the heterologous protein to be produced by secretory production by the method of the present invention and the gene coding for it. Further, in the genes coding for these proteins, any codon may be replaced with an equivalent codon thereof. For example, in the genes coding for these proteins, codons may be optimized as required according to codon frequencies observed in the host. The N-terminus region of the heterologous protein obtained by the method of the present invention may be the same as that of the natural protein, or may not be the same as that of the natural protein. For example, the N-terminus region of the eventually obtained heterologous protein may be that of the natural protein including addition or deletion of one or several amino acid residues. Although the number of the “one or several” amino acid residues may differ depending on the full length or structure of the objective heterologous protein, specifically, it can be 1 to 20, 1 to 10, or 1 to 5. Further, the heterologous protein to be produced by secretory production may be a protein containing a pro-structure part (proprotein). In the case where the heterologous protein to be produced by secretory production is a proprotein, the heterologous protein to be eventually obtained may be the proprotein or may not be the proprotein. That is, the proprotein may be processed into the mature protein by cleavage of the pro-structure part. The cleavage can be attained with, for example, a protease. When a protease is used, in view of the activity of the protein to be eventually obtained, the proprotein is generally cleaved preferably at a position substantially the same as that of the natural protein, or more preferably at a position exactly the same as that of the natural protein to obtain the same mature protein as the natural mature protein. Therefore, a specific protease that cleaves the proprotein at such a position that the same protein as the naturally occurring mature protein is generated is most preferred. However, the N-terminus region of the heterologous protein to be eventually obtained may not be the same as that of the natural protein as described above. For example, depending on type, purpose of use, etc. of the heterologous protein to be produced, a protein having an N-terminus longer or shorter by one to several amino acid residues compared with the natural protein may have more appropriate activity. Proteases that can be used include, for example, commercially available proteases such as Dispase (produced by Boehringer Mannheim) as well as those obtainable from culture broth of a microorganism such as culture broth of actinomycetes. Such proteases can be used in an un-purified state, or may also be used after purification to an appropriate purity as required. The method for introducing the genetic construct into the coryneform bacterium is not particularly limited. In the bacterium of the present invention, the genetic construct can be present on a vector that autonomously replicates out of the chromosome such as a plasmid, or may be incorporated into the chromosome. In addition, as described above, for constructing the bacterium of the present invention, modifications such as the introduction of the genetic construct, impartation or enhancement of the ability to produce a protein by secretory production, reduction of activity of a penicillin-binding protein, and reduction of activity of a cell surface layer protein can be performed in an arbitrary order. The genetic construct can be introduced into a host by using, for example, a vector including the genetic construct. The vector is not particularly limited so long as a vector autonomously replicable in the coryneform bacterium is chosen, and may be, for example, a vector derived from a bacterial plasmid, a vector derived from a yeast plasmid, a vector derived from a bacteriophage, cosmid, phagemid, or the like. As the vector, for example, a plasmid derived from a coryneform bacterium is preferred. Specific examples of vector autonomously replicable in coryneform bacteria include pHM1519 (Agric. Biol. Chem., 48, 2901-2903 (1984)); pAM330 (Agric. Biol. Chem., 48, 2901-2903 (1984)); plasmids obtained by improving these and having a drug resistance gene; plasmid pCRY30 described in Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 3-210184; plasmids pCRY21, pCRY2KE, pCRY2KX, pCRY31, pCRY3KE, and pCRY3KX described in Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 2-72876 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,185,262; plasmids pCRY2 and pCRY3 described in Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 1-191686; pAJ655, pAJ611, and pAJ1844 described in Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 58-192900; pCG1 described in Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 57-134500; pCG2 described in Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 58-35197; pCG4 and pCG11 described in Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 57-183799; pVK7 described in Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 10-215883; pVC7 described in Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 9-070291; and so forth. Further, an artificial transposon and so forth can also be used. When a transposon is used, a heterologous protein gene is introduced into a chromosome by homologous recombination or translocation ability of the transposon itself. Other examples of the introduction method utilizing homologous recombination include, for example, the methods utilizing a linear DNA, a plasmid having a temperature sensitive replication origin, a plasmid capable of conjugative transfer, a suicide vector not having a replication origin which functions in a host, and so forth. In addition, when a heterologous protein gene is introduced into a chromosome, so long as the genetic construct is present on the chromosome, either one or both of a promoter sequence and a nucleic acid sequence coding for the signal peptide contained in the genetic construct may be native to the host chromosome. Specifically, for example, by using a promoter sequence and a nucleic acid sequence coding for the signal peptide ligated downstream from the promoter sequence native to the host chromosome as they are, and replacing only the gene ligated downstream from the nucleic acid sequence coding for the signal peptide with the objective heterologous protein gene, the genetic construct can be present on the chromosome, and the bacterium of the present invention can be thereby constructed. Also, in the case where two or more kinds of proteins are expressed, genetic constructs for secretory expression of the proteins may be harbored by the bacterium of the present invention so that secretory expression of the target heterologous protein(s) can be attained. Specifically, for example, all of the genetic constructs for secretory expression of the proteins may be harbored on a single vector, or may be harbored on a chromosome. Further, the genetic constructs for secretory expression of the proteins may be harbored separately on a plurality of vectors, or may be harbored separately on a single or a plurality of vectors and a chromosome. The “case where two or more kinds of proteins are expressed” can include, for example, the case where two or more kinds of heterologous proteins are produced by secretory production, or the case where a hetero-multimeric protein is produced by secretory production. The method for introducing the genetic construct into the coryneform bacterium is not particularly limited, and a generally used method, for example, the protoplast method (Gene, 39, 281-286 (1985)), the electroporation method (Bio/Technology, 7, 1067-1070 (1989)), and so forth can be used. <2> Method for Producing a Heterologous Protein of the Present Invention The present invention provides a method for producing a heterologous protein by culturing the bacterium of the present invention and collecting the heterologous protein produced by secretory production (henceforth also referred to as the “method of the present invention” or the “method for producing a heterologous protein of the present invention”). The bacterium of the present invention can be cultured according to usually used method and conditions. For example, the bacterium of the present invention can be cultured in a usual medium containing a carbon source, a nitrogen source, and inorganic ions. In order to obtain still higher proliferation, organic micronutrients such as vitamins and amino acids can also be added as required. As the carbon source, carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose, organic acids such as acetic acid, alcohols, and others can be used. As the nitrogen source, ammonia gas, aqueous ammonia, ammonium salts, and others can be used. As the inorganic ions, calcium ions, magnesium ions, phosphate ions, potassium ions, iron ions, and so forth are appropriately used as required. The culture is performed within appropriate ranges of pH 5.0 to 8.5 and 15 to 37° C. for 1 to 7 days under aerobic conditions. Further, the culture conditions for L-amino acid production by coryneform bacteria and other conditions described in the methods for producing a protein using a signal peptide of the Sec type or the Tat type can be used (refer to WO01/23591 and WO2005/103278). Further, when an inducible promoter is used for expression of the heterologous protein, culture may also be performed with adding a promoter-inducing agent to the medium. By culturing the bacterium of the present invention under such conditions, a large amount of the objective protein can be produced in cells and efficiently secreted out of the cells. In addition, the produced heterologous protein can be secreted out of the cells, and therefore a protein that may be lethal if it is accumulated in a large amount in cells of microorganisms, such as transglutaminases, can also be continuously produced without lethal effect. The protein secreted in the medium according to the method of the present invention can be separated and purified from the medium after the culture by a method well known to those skilled in the art. For example, after the cells are removed by centrifugation or the like, the protein can be separated and purified by a known appropriate method such as salting out, ethanol precipitation, ultrafiltration, gel filtration chromatography, ion exchange column chromatography, affinity chromatography, medium or high pressure liquid chromatography, reverse phase chromatography, and hydrophobic chromatography, or a combination of these. Further, in a certain case, culture or culture supernatant may be used as it is. The protein secreted in the cell surface layer according to the method of the present invention can also be separated and purified in the same manner as that for the case where the protein is secreted in the medium, after solubilizing it by a method well known to those skilled in the art such as elevation of salt concentration and use of a surfactant. Further, in a certain case, the protein secreted in the cell surface layer may be used as, for example, an immobilized enzyme, without solubilizing it. Secretory production of the objective heterologous protein can be confirmed by performing SDS-PAGE for the culture supernatant and/or a fraction containing the cell surface layer as a sample thereby confirming the molecular weight of the separated protein bands. In addition, secretory production of the objective heterologous protein can be confirmed by performing Western blotting using antibodies for the culture supernatant and/or a fraction containing the cell surface layer as a sample (Molecular Cloning, Cold spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor (USA), 2001). Further, secretory production of the objective heterologous protein can be confirmed by determination of N-terminus amino acid sequence using protein sequencer. Furthermore, secretory production of the objective heterologous protein can be confirmed by measuring its mass using mass spectrometer. Also, when the objective heterologous protein is an enzyme or a protein having some kind of bioactivity that can be measured, secretory production of the objective heterologous protein can be confirmed by measuring enzyme activity or bioactivity of the protein in the culture supernatant and/or a fraction containing the cell surface layer as a sample. EXAMPLES The present invention will be further specifically explained with reference to the following non-limiting examples. Example 1 Construction of a Corynebacterium glutamicum that is Deficient in Each of Penicillin-Binding Proteins PBP1a and PBP1b (1) Construction of vector pBSΔCgl0278 for deleting Cgl0278 gene coding for PBP1a The genome sequence of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 and the nucleotide sequence of the Cgl0278 gene coding for the penicillin-binding protein PBP1a have already been determined (Genbank Accession No. BA000036, NCBI gene entry NCgl0274). With reference to this sequence, the primers shown as SEQ ID NOS: 1, 2, 3, and 4 were synthesized. By PCR using the chromosomal DNA of the C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 strain prepared in a conventional manner (method of Saito and Miura [Biochim Biophys. Acta, 72, 619 (1963)]) as a template, and the primers of SEQ ID NOS: 1 and 2, and SEQ ID NOS: 3 and 4, about 1 kbp of the 5′ side upstream region and about 1 kbp of 3′ side downstream region of Cgl0278 coding for PBP1a were amplified, respectively. Then, by PCR using both the amplified DNA fragments as a template and DNAs shown as SEQ ID NOS: 1 and 4 as primers, a DNA fragment of about 2 kbp having both the fragments fused to each other was obtained. In the primers of SEQ ID NOS: 1 and 4, recognition sequences for the restriction enzymes BamH I and Xba I were designed, respectively. For PCR, Pyrobest DNA Polymerase (produced by Takara Bio) was used, and the reaction conditions were those of the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. This DNA fragment was treated with the restriction enzymes BamH I and Xba I, and inserted into the BamH I-Xba I site of pBS4 described in WO2005/113744 to obtain a vector pBSΔCgl0278 for deleting the Cgl0278 gene. For the ligation reaction, DNA Ligation Kit Ver. 2.1 (produced by Takara Bio) was used, and the reaction conditions were those of the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. (2) Construction of Vector pBSΔCgl2986 for Deleting Cgl2986 Gene Coding for PBP1b The genome sequence of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 and the nucleotide sequence of the Cgl2986 gene coding for the penicillin-binding protein PBP1b have already been determined (Genbank Accession No. BA000036, NCBI gene entry NCgl2884). In the same manner as that for Cgl0278, with reference to this sequence, the primers shown as SEQ ID NOS: 5, 6, 7, and 8 were synthesized. By PCR using the prepared chromosomal DNA of the C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 strain as a template, and the primers of SEQ ID NOS: 5 and 6, and SEQ ID NOS: 7 and 8, about 1.3 kbp of 5′ side upstream region and about 1.1 kbp of 3′ side downstream region of Cgl2986 coding for PBP1b were amplified, respectively. Then, by PCR using both the amplified DNA fragments as a template and DNAs shown as SEQ ID NOS: 05 and 08 as primers, a DNA fragment of about 2.4 kbp consisting of both the fragments fused to each other was obtained. The obtained DNA fragment of about 2.4 kbp contained one recognition sequence for the restriction enzyme Pst I and one recognition sequence for the restriction enzyme Sal I. For PCR, Pyrobest DNA Polymerase (produced by Takara Bio) was used, and the reaction conditions were those of the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. A fragment of about 2.2 kbp obtained by treating the above DNA fragment with the restriction enzymes Pst I and Sal I was inserted into the Pst I-Sal I site of pBS5T described in WO2006/057450 to obtain a vector pBSΔCgl2986 for deleting the Cgl2986 gene. (3) Construction of PBP1a-Deficient Strain and PBP1b-Deficient Strain Then, the C. glutamicum YDK010 strain described in WO2004/029254 was transformed with each of the constructed pBSΔCgl0278 and pBSΔCgl2986. The C. glutamicum YDK010 strain is a cell surface layer protein PS2 deficient strain of the C. glutamicum AJ12036 strain (FERM BP-734) (WO2004/029254). Strains were selected from the obtained transformants according to the methods described in WO2005/113744 and WO2006/057450 to obtain YDK010ΔPBP1a strain deficient in the Cgl0278 gene and YDK010ΔPBP1b strain deficient in the Cg12986 gene. Example 2 Secretory Expression of H Chain Region of Fab Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab Using Corynebacterium glutamicum Strains Made Deficient in Penicillin-Binding Proteins PBP1a and PBP1b, Respectively Construction of Plasmid for Secretory Expression of H Chain Region of Fab Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab The gene sequence of the variable region of the H chain in the breast cancer cell specific antibody, trastuzumab, has already been determined (Genbank Accession No. AY513484). With reference to this sequence and a sequence of the non-variable region of the H chain of a common antibody, DNAs shown as SEQ ID NOS: 9 to 42 were synthesized in consideration of the codon frequencies in C. glutamicum. The full length H chain region of trastuzumab was amplified by PCR using the above DNAs as a template and separately synthesized DNAs shown as SEQ ID NOS: 43 and 44 as primers thereby to obtain a DNA fragment of about 1.4 kbp shown as SEQ ID NO: 45. The amino acid sequence of the H chain of the antibody trastuzumab encoded by the DNA of SEQ ID NO: 45 was shown in SEQ ID NO: 86. Then, by using pPKSPTG1 described in WO01/23591 (pPKSPTG1 is a vector for secretory expression of protransglutaminase (transglutaminase containing a pro-structure part), and contains a promoter derived from the PS2 gene of the C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 strain, a DNA coding for the signal peptide derived from SlpA of the C. ammoniagenes (C. stationis) ATCC 6872 strain expressibly ligated downstream from the promoter, and the protransglutaminase gene derived from Streptoverticillium mobaraense ligated so that the protein is expressed as a fusion protein with the above signal peptide) as a template and the primers shown as SEQ ID NOS: 46 and 47, a region including the aforementioned promoter region and the aforementioned signal peptide region was amplified by PCR thereby to obtain a DNA fragment of about 0.7 kbp. Then, by PCR using both the amplified DNA fragments (the fragment including the full length H chain region of trastuzumab and the fragment including the promoter region and the signal peptide region) as a template and DNAs shown as SEQ ID NOS: 44 and 46 as primers, a DNA fragment of about 2.0 kbp having both the DNA fragments fused to each other was obtained. Then, by PCR using this fusion DNA fragment as a template and DNAs shown as SEQ ID NOS: 46 and 48, SEQ ID NOS: 46 and 49, SEQ ID NOS 46 and 50, SEQ ID NOS: 46 and 51, SEQ ID NOS: 46 and 52, SEQ ID NOS: 46 and 53, and SEQ ID NOS: 46 and 54 as primers, DNA fragments of about 1.4 kbp each was obtained, respectively. In the primer of SEQ ID NO: 46, a recognition sequence for the restriction enzyme Kpn I was designed. In each of the primers of SEQ ID NOS: 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53 and 54, the stop codon and a recognition sequence for the restriction enzyme Kpn I were designed. For PCR, Pyrobest DNA Polymerase (produced by Takara Bio) was used, and the reaction conditions were those of the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. These DNA fragments were treated with the restriction enzyme Kpn I, and each inserted into the Kpn I site of pPK4 described in Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 9-322774 to obtain plasmids enabling secretory expression of the H chain region of the Fab moiety of trastuzumab, pPKStrast-FabH(1-223C), pPKStrast-FabH(1-228T), pPKStrast-FabH(1-229C), pPKStrast-FabH(1-230P), pPKStrast-FabH(1-231P), pPKStrast-FabH(1-232C), and pPKStrast-FabH(1-233P). Specifically, with these plasmids, an amino acid sequence of the H chain of trastuzumab from the first amino acid residue to 223rd, 228th, 229th, 230th, 231st, 232nd or 233rd amino acid residue can be expressed (numbers of expressible amino acid residues are included in the plasmid names). By determining the nucleotide sequences of the inserted fragments, it was confirmed that expected genes were constructed. The nucleotide sequences were determined by using BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (produced by Applied Biosystems), and 3130 Genetic Analyzer (produced by Applied Biosystems). (2) Secretory Expression of H Chain Region of Fab Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab Using Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP1a-Deficient Strain and PBP1b-Deficient Strain By using the plasmid for secretory expression of the H chain region of the Fab fragment of the antibody trastuzumab constructed in Example 2 (1), pPKStrast-FabH(1-229C), each of the YDK010 strain, the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain, and the YDK010ΔPBP1b strain was transformed. Each of the obtained transformants was cultured in the MM liquid medium (120 g of glucose, 3 g of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 30 g of ammonium sulfate, 1.5 g of potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 0.03 g of iron sulfate heptahydrate, 0.03 g of manganese sulfate pentahydrate, 450 μg of thiamine hydrochloride, 450 μg of biotin, 0.15 g of DL-methionine, and 50 g of calcium carbonate in a volume of 1 L with water, adjusted to pH 7.0) containing 25 mg/l of kanamycin at 30° C. for 72 hours. After completion of the culture, culture supernatant obtained by centrifuging each culture broth was subjected to reduced SDS-PAGE, and then stained with SYPRO Orange (produced by Invitrogen). As a result, the band of the objective protein was not detected for the parent strain YDK010 and the YDK010ΔPBP1b strain, whereas a band of a protein of the same molecular weight as that of the objective H chain of the Fab fragment of the antibody trastuzumab was detected only for the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain (FIGS. 1 and 2). When the N-terminus sequence of the protein of this band was determined by using a protein sequencer PPSQ-21A (produced by Shimadzu), the sequence agreed with the N-terminus sequence of the objective H chain of the Fab fragment of the antibody trastuzumab, and therefore secretory expression of the H chain of the Fab fragment of the antibody trastuzumab in the culture supernatant was confirmed. Then, by using each of the plasmids for secretory expression of the H chain region of the Fab fragment of the antibody trastuzumab constructed in Example 2 (1), pPKStrast-FabH(1-223C), pPKStrast-FabH(1-228T), pPKStrast-FabH(1-229C), pPKStrast-FabH(1-230P), pPKStrast-FabH(1-231P), pPKStrast-FabH(1-232C), and pPKStrast-FabH(1-233P), each of the YDK010 strain and the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain was transformed. Each of the obtained transformants was cultured in the MM liquid medium (120 g of glucose, 3 g of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 30 g of ammonium sulfate, 1.5 g of potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 0.03 g of iron sulfate heptahydrate, 0.03 g of manganese sulfate pentahydrate, 450 μg of thiamine hydrochloride, 450 μg of biotin, 0.15 g of DL-methionine, and 50 g of calcium carbonate in a volume of 1 L with water, adjusted to pH 7.0) containing 25 mg/l of kanamycin at 30° C. for 72 hours. After completion of the culture, culture supernatant obtained by centrifuging each culture broth was subjected to reduced SDS-PAGE, and then stained with SYPRO Orange (produced by Invitrogen). As a result, even when any of the secretory expression plasmids was used, the band of the objective protein was not detected for the parent strain YDK010, whereas a band of a protein of the same molecular weight as that of the H chain of the Fab fragment of the objective antibody trastuzumab was detected only for the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain (FIG. 3). Example 3 Secretory Expression of L Chain Region of Fab Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab Using Corynebacterium glutamicum Made Deficient in Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP1a Construction of Plasmid for Secretory Expression of L Chain Region of Fab Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab The gene sequence of the variable region of the L chain in the breast cancer cell specific antibody, trastuzumab, has already been determined (Genbank Accession No. AY513485). With reference to this sequence and a sequence of the non-variable region of the L chain of a common antibody, DNAs shown as SEQ ID NOS: 55 to 70 were synthesized in consideration of the codon frequencies in C. glutamicum. The full length L chain region of trastuzumab was amplified by PCR using the above DNAs as a template and separately synthesized DNAs shown as SEQ ID NOS: 71 and 72 as primers thereby to obtain a DNA fragment shown as SEQ ID NO: 73 of about 0.6 kbp. The amino acid sequence of the L chain of the antibody trastuzumab encoded by the DNA of SEQ ID NO: 73 was shown in SEQ ID NO: 87. Then, by using pPKSPTG1 described in WO01/23591 (containing a promoter derived from the C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 strain and a signal peptide region derived from the C. ammoniagenes (C. stationis) ATCC 6872 strain) as a template and the primers shown as SEQ ID NOS: 74 and 75, a region including the aforementioned promoter region and the aforementioned signal peptide region was amplified by PCR thereby to obtain a DNA fragment of about 0.7 kbp. Then, by PCR using both the amplified DNA fragments (the fragment including the L chain region of trastuzumab and the fragment including the promoter region and the signal peptide region) as a template and DNAs shown as SEQ ID NOS: 74 and 76 as primers, a DNA fragment of about 1.3 kbp consisting of both the DNA fragments fused to each other was obtained. In the primers of SEQ ID NOS: 74 and 76, a recognition sequence for the restriction enzyme BamH I was designed. For PCR, Pyrobest DNA Polymerase (produced by Takara Bio) was used, and the reaction conditions were those of the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. This fusion DNA fragment was treated with the restriction enzyme BamH I, and inserted into the BamH I site of pPK4 described in Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 9-322774 to obtain a plasmid enabling secretory expression of the L chain region of the Fab moiety of trastuzumab, pPKStrast-FabL. By determining the nucleotide sequence of the inserted fragment, it was confirmed that expected gene was constructed. The nucleotide sequence was determined by using BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (produced by Applied Biosystems), and 3130 Genetic Analyzer (produced by Applied Biosystems). (2) Secretory Expression of L Chain Region of Fab Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab Using Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP1a-Deficient Strain By using the plasmid for secretory expression of the L chain region of the Fab fragment of the antibody trastuzumab constructed in Example 3 (1), pPKStrast-FabL, each of the YDK010 strain and the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain was transformed. Each of the obtained transformants was cultured in the MM liquid medium (120 g of glucose, 3 g of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 30 g of ammonium sulfate, 1.5 g of potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 0.03 g of iron sulfate heptahydrate, 0.03 g of manganese sulfate pentahydrate, 450 μg of thiamine hydrochloride, 450 μg of biotin, 0.15 g of DL-methionine, and 50 g of calcium carbonate in a volume of 1 L with water, adjusted to pH 7.0) containing 25 mg/l of kanamycin at 30° C. for 72 hours. After completion of the culture, culture supernatant obtained by centrifuging each culture broth was subjected to reduced SDS-PAGE, and then stained with CBB R250 (produced by Bio-Rad). As a result, a band of a protein of the same molecular weight as that of the L chain of the Fab fragment of the objective antibody trastuzumab was detected for the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain with a band strength higher than at least twice the strength observed for the parent strain YDK010 (FIG. 4). When the N-terminus sequence of the protein of this band was determined by using a protein sequencer PPSQ-21A (produced by Shimadzu), the sequence agreed with the N-terminus sequence of the L chain of the Fab fragment of the objective antibody trastuzumab, and therefore secretory expression of the L chain of the Fab fragment of the antibody trastuzumab in the culture supernatant could be confirmed. Example 4 Secretory Expression of Fab(H&L) Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab Using Corynebacterium glutamicum Strain Made Deficient in Penicillin-Binding Proteins PBP1a (1) Construction of Plasmid for Secretory Expression of Fab(H&L) Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab By inserting DNA fragments of about 1.4 kbs each, which were obtained by digesting the expression plasmids for the H chain region of the Fab fragment of the antibody trastuzumab constructed in Example 2 (1) with the restriction enzyme Kpn I, into the Kpn I site of pPKStrast-FabL, which was an expression plasmid for the L chain region of the Fab fragment of the antibody trastuzumab constructed in Example 3 (1), plasmids for coexpression of the H chain region and the L chain region of the Fab fragment of trastuzumab, pPKStrast-FabH(1-223C)+L, pPKStrast-FabH(1-228T)+L, pPKStrast-FabH(1-229C)+L, pPKStrast-FabH(1-230P)+L, pPKStrast-FabH(1-231P)+L, pPKStrast-FabH(1-232C)+L, and pPKStrast-FabH(1-233P)+L were obtained. (2) Secretory Expression of Fab(H&L) Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab Using Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP1a Deficient Strain By using the plasmids for secretory expression of the Fab(H&L) fragment of the antibody trastuzumab constructed in Example 4 (1), pPKStrast-FabH(1-223C)+L, pPKStrast-FabH(1-228T)+L, pPKStrast-FabH(1-229C)+L, pPKStrast-FabH(1-230P)+L, pPKStrast-FabH(1-231P)+L, pPKStrast-FabH(1-232C)+L, and pPKStrast-FabH(1-233P)+L, each of the YDK010 strain and the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain was transformed. Each of the obtained transformants was cultured in the MM liquid medium (120 g of glucose, 3 g of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 30 g of ammonium sulfate, 1.5 g of potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 0.03 g of iron sulfate heptahydrate, 0.03 g of manganese sulfate pentahydrate, 450 μg of thiamine hydrochloride, 450 μg of biotin, 0.15 g of DL-methionine, and 50 g of calcium carbonate in a volume of 1 L with water, adjusted to pH 7.0) containing 25 mg/l of kanamycin at 30° C. for 96 hours. After completion of the culture, culture supernatant obtained by centrifuging each culture broth was subjected to non-reduced SDS-PAGE, and then stained with SYPRO Orange (produced by Invitrogen), and secretion amounts of the Fab(H&L) fragments of the antibody trastuzumab were compared. As a result, even when any of the secretory expression plasmids was used, the secretion amount of the Fab(H&L) fragment of the antibody trastuzumab was significantly improved in the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain compared with that observed for the parent strain YDK010 (FIG. 5). When the N-terminus sequence of the Fab(H&L) protein in the band detected for the transformant obtained from the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain using pPKStrast-FabH(1-229C)+L was determined with a protein sequencer PPSQ-21A (produced by Shimadzu), both sequences of the N-terminus sequence of the H chain and the N-terminus sequences of the L chain of the Fab fragment of the objective antibody trastuzumab were included, and therefore it could be confirmed that the Fab(H&L) fragments of the antibody trastuzumab were expressed and secreted to form aggregates in the culture supernatant. (3) Secretory Expression of F(Ab′)2 Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab Using Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP 1a Deficient Strain Each of the culture supernatants obtained in Example 4 (2) was subjected to non-reduced SDS-PAGE, and then proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane by using iBlot® Gel Transfer Stacks PVDF, Mini (produced by Invitrogen) and iBlot™ Gel Transfer System (produced by Invitrogen). Western blotting was performed for this PVDF membrane by using an alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-human IgG [H&L] antibody (produced by ROCKLAND) and Alkaline Phosphatase Conjugate Substrate Kit (produced by Bio-Rad) thereby to detect F(ab′)2 of the antibody trastuzumab. As a result, the band of a protein of the same molecular weight as that of F(ab′)2 fragment of the antibody trastuzumab was detected for the culture supernatant of the transformant harboring each of pPKStrast-FabH(1-229C)+L, pPKStrast-FabH(1-230P)+L, pPKStrast-FabH(1-231P)+L, pPKStrast-FabH(1-232C)+L, and pPKStrast-FabH(1-233P)+L, which are plasmids for coexpression of the H chain region comprising Cys residue which forms disulfide bond linking the H chains, and the L chain region. Further, even when any of these secretory expression plasmids was used, the intensity of the band of the protein of the same molecular weight as that of F(ab′)2 fragment of the antibody trastuzumab was significantly improved in the YDK010ΔPBP 1a strain compared with that observed for the parent strain YDK010 (FIG. 6). Example 5 Secretory Expression of Fc Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab Using Corynebacterium glutamicum Made Deficient in Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP 1a (1) Construction of Plasmid for Secretory Expression of Fc Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab The Fc region of the H chain of trastuzumab was amplified by PCR using the DNA shown as SEQ ID NO: 45 containing the full length H chain region of trastuzumab, which was synthesized in Example 2 (1), as a template, and separately synthesized DNAs shown as SEQ ID NOS: 77 and 78, and SEQ ID NOS: 77 and 79 as primers thereby to obtain DNA fragments of about 0.7 kbp each. Then, by using pPKSPTG1 described in WO01/23591 (containing a promoter region derived from the C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 strain and a signal peptide region derived from the C. ammoniagenes (C. stationis) ATCC 6872 strain) as a template and the primers shown as SEQ ID NOS: 46 and 80, a region including the aforementioned promoter region and the aforementioned signal peptide region was amplified by PCR thereby to obtain a DNA fragment of about 0.7 kbp. Then, by PCR using both the amplified DNA fragments (each of the fragments including the Fc region of the H chain region of trastuzumab and the fragment including the promoter region and the signal peptide region) as a template and DNAs shown as SEQ ID NOS: 46 and 77 as primers, DNA fragments of about 1.4 kbp each consisting of both the DNA fragments fused to each other were obtained. In the primers of SEQ ID NOS: 46 and 77, a recognition sequence for the restriction enzyme Kpn I was designed. For PCR, Pyrobest DNA Polymerase (produced by Takara Bio) was used, and the reaction conditions were those of the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. These DNA fragments were treated with the restriction enzyme Kpn I, and then each inserted into the Kpn I site of pPK4 described in Japanese Patent Laid-open (Kokai) No. 9-322774 to obtain plasmids enabling secretory expression of the Fc region of the H chain region of trastuzumab, pPKStrast-Fc(H224D-450) and pPKStrast-Fc (H231P-450). Specifically, with these plasmids, an amino acid sequence of the H chain of trastuzumab from the 224th or 231st amino acid residue to the 450th amino acid residue can be expressed (numbers of expressible amino acid residues are included in the plasmid names). By determining the nucleotide sequences of the inserted fragments, it was confirmed that expected genes were constructed. The nucleotide sequences were determined by using BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (produced by Applied Biosystems), and 3130 Genetic Analyzer (produced by Applied Biosystems). (2) Secretory Expression of Fc Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab Using Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP1a-Deficient Strain By using the plasmids for secretory expression of the Fc fragment of the antibody trastuzumab constructed in Example 5 (1), pPKStrast-Fc(H224D-450) and pPKStrast-Fc(H231P-450), each of the YDK010 strain and the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain was transformed. Each of the obtained transformants was cultured in the MM liquid medium (120 g of glucose, 3 g of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 30 g of ammonium sulfate, 1.5 g of potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 0.03 g of iron sulfate heptahydrate, 0.03 g of manganese sulfate pentahydrate, 450 μg of thiamine hydrochloride, 450 μg of biotin, 0.15 g of DL-methionine, and 50 g of calcium carbonate in a volume of 1 L with water, adjusted to pH 7.0) containing 25 mg/l of kanamycin at 30° C. for 72 hours. After completion of the culture, culture supernatant obtained by centrifuging each culture broth was subjected to reduced SDS-PAGE, and then proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane by using iBlot® Gel Transfer Stacks PVDF, Mini (produced by Invitrogen) and iBlot™ Gel Transfer System (produced by Invitrogen). Western blotting was performed for this PVDF membrane by using an alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-human IgG [H&L] antibody (produced by ROCKLAND) and Alkaline Phosphatase Conjugate Substrate Kit (produced by Bio-Rad) to compare secretion amounts of the Fc fragment of the antibody trastuzumab. As a result, even when any of the secretory expression plasmids was used, the secretion amount of the Fc fragment of the antibody trastuzumab was significantly improved in the YDK010ΔPBP 1a strain compared with that observed for the parent strain YDK010 (FIG. 7). Example 6 Secretory Expression of Protransglutaminase Using Corynebacterium Glutamicum Made Deficient in Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP1a (1) Secretory Expression of Protransglutaminase Using Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP1a-Deficient Strain The secretory expression system of the protransglutaminase using C. glutamicum has already been reported (WO01/23591). Then, by using the plasmid vector pPKSPTG1 for secretory expression of protransglutaminase described in WO01/23591, each of the YDK010 strain and the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain was transformed. Each of the obtained transformants was cultured in the MM liquid medium (120 g of glucose, 3 g of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 30 g of ammonium sulfate, 1.5 g of potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 0.03 g of iron sulfate heptahydrate, 0.03 g of manganese sulfate pentahydrate, 450 μg of thiamine hydrochloride, 450 μg of biotin, 0.15 g of DL-methionine, and 50 g of calcium carbonate in a volume of 1 L with water, adjusted to pH 7.0) containing 25 mg/l of kanamycin at 30° C. for 72 hours. After completion of the culture, culture supernatant obtained by centrifuging each culture broth was subjected to reduced SDS-PAGE, and then stained with CBB R250 (produced by Bio-Rad). Secretion amounts of the protransglutaminase were determined according to the previous report (Protein Expr. Purif., 26:329-335), and the amounts were compared. As a result, the secretion amount of the protransglutaminase was significantly improved in the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain compared with that observed for the parent strain YDK010 (FIG. 8). Example 7 Secretory Expression of Anti-Digoxin Single-Chain Antibody (scFv) Using Corynebacterium glutamicum Made Deficient in Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP1a (1) Construction of Plasmid for Secretory Expression of Anti-Digoxin Single-Chain Antibody (scFv) The gene sequence of the anti-digoxin scFv has already been determined and the expression thereof using Bacillus subtilis has been explored (Biotechnology (N Y)., 11(1): 71-76 (1993)). With reference to this sequence, a DNA fragment shown in SEQ ID NO: 88 comprising the promoter derived from the PS2 gene of the C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 strain, a DNA coding for the signal peptide derived from SlpA of the C. ammoniagenes (C. stationis) ATCC 6872 strain expressibly ligated downstream from the promoter, and a DNA coding for the anti-digoxin scFv ligated so that the protein is expressed as a fusion protein with the above signal peptide was totally synthesized. The synthesized DNA of SEQ ID NO: 88 comprises the recognition sites of the restriction enzyme Xba I at 5′ terminus and 3′ terminus. The DNA coding for the anti-digoxin scFv in the synthesized DNA was designed in view of the codon usage frequency of C. glutamicum. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA coding for the anti-digoxin scFv in the synthesized DNA was shown in SEQ ID NO: 89, and the amino acid sequence of the anti-digoxin scFv was shown in SEQ ID NO: 90. The totally-synthesized DNA fragment was digested with the restriction enzyme Xba I, and inserted into the Xba I site of pPK4 described in JP9-322774A, thereby to obtain a plasmid enabling expression of the anti-digoxin scFv, pPKSSCA1. (2) Secretory Expression of Anti-Digoxin Single-Chain Antibody (scFv) Using Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP1a-Deficient Strain By using the plasmid for secretory expression of the anti-digoxin scFv constructed in Example 7 (1), pPKSSCA1, each of the YDK010 strain and the YDK010ΔPBP 1a strain was transformed. Each of the obtained transformants was cultured in the MM liquid medium (120 g of glucose, 3 g of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 30 g of ammonium sulfate, 1.5 g of potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 0.03 g of iron sulfate heptahydrate, 0.03 g of manganese sulfate pentahydrate, 450 μg of thiamine hydrochloride, 450 μg of biotin, 0.15 g of DL-methionine, and 50 g of calcium carbonate in a volume of 1 L with water, adjusted to pH 7.0) containing 25 mg/l of kanamycin at 30° C. for 72 hours. After completion of the culture, culture supernatant obtained by centrifuging each culture broth was subjected to reduced SDS-PAGE, and then stained with SYPRO Orange (produced by Invitrogen). As a result, a band of a protein of the same molecular weight as that of the objective anti-digoxin scFv was detected for the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain with a band strength higher than at least twice the strength observed for the parent strain YDK010 (FIG. 9). When the N-terminus sequence of the protein of this band was determined by using a protein sequencer PPSQ-21A (produced by Shimadzu), the sequence agreed with the N-terminus sequence of the objective anti-digoxin scFv, and therefore secretory expression of the anti-digoxin scFv in the culture supernatant could be confirmed. Example 8 Secretory Expression of Fab(H&L) Fragment of Antibody Adalimumab Using Corynebacterium glutamicum Made Deficient in Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP1a (1) Construction of Plasmid for Secretory Expression of Fab(H&L) Fragment of Antibody Adalimumab The amino acid sequence of the tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) specific antibody, adalimumab, has already been determined (Assessment Report on Feb. 14, 2008, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency). With reference to this sequence, a DNA fragment shown in SEQ ID NO: 91 that includes the promoter derived from the PS2 gene of the C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 strain, a DNA coding for the signal peptide derived from SlpA of the C. ammoniagenes (C. stationis) ATCC 6872 strain expressibly ligated downstream from the promoter, and a DNA coding for the amino acid sequence from position 1 to Cys residue at position 230 of the H chain of adalimumab ligated so that the protein is expressed as a fusion protein with the above signal peptide, and further includes in the downstream thereof the promoter derived from the PS2 gene of the C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 strain, a DNA coding for the signal peptide derived from SlpA of the C. ammoniagenes (C. stationis) ATCC 6872 strain expressibly ligated downstream from the promoter, and a DNA coding for the L chain of adalimumab ligated so that the protein is expressed as a fusion protein with the above signal peptide was totally synthesized. Similarly, a DNA fragment shown in SEQ ID NO: 92 that includes the promoter derived from the PS2 gene of the C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 strain, a DNA coding for the signal peptide derived from SlpA of the C. ammoniagenes (C. stationis) ATCC 6872 strain expressibly ligated downstream from the promoter, and a DNA coding for the L chain of adalimumab ligated so that the protein is expressed as a fusion protein with the above signal peptide, and further includes in the downstream thereof the promoter derived from the PS2 gene of the C. glutamicum ATCC 13869 strain, a DNA coding for the signal peptide derived from SlpA of the C. ammoniagenes (C. stationis) ATCC 6872 strain expressibly ligated downstream from the promoter, and a DNA coding for the amino acid sequence from position 1 to Cys residue at position 230 of the H chain of adalimumab ligated so that the protein is expressed as a fusion protein with the above signal peptide was totally synthesized. Each of the synthesized DNAs of SEQ ID NOS: 91 and 92 comprises the recognition site of the restriction enzyme BamH I at 5′ terminus and the recognition site of the restriction enzyme Xba I at 3′ terminus. The DNAs coding for the H chain and the L chain of adalimumab in the synthesized DNAs were designed in view of the codon usage frequency of C. glutamicum. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA coding for the amino acid sequence from position 1 to position 230 of the H chain of adalimumab in the synthesized DNA was shown in SEQ ID NO: 93, and the amino acid sequence was shown in SEQ ID NO: 94. Also, the nucleotide sequence of the DNA coding for the L chain of adalimumab in the synthesized DNA was shown in SEQ ID NO: 95, and the amino acid sequence of the L chain of adalimumab was shown in SEQ ID NO: 96. Each of the totally-synthesized DNA fragments of about 2.7 kbp was digested with the restriction enzymes BamH I and Xba I, and inserted into the BamH I-Xba I site of pPK4 described in JP9-322774A, thereby to obtain plasmids enabling coexpression of the H chain (1-230C) and the L chain of adalimumab, pPKSada-FabHL and pPKSada-FabLH. “FabHL” and “FabLH” in the names of the respective plasmids indicate the incorporation order of the H chain gene and the L chain gene of adalimumab in the expression plasmids. (2) Secretory Expression of Fab(H&L) Fragment of Antibody Adalimumab Using Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP1a Deficient Strain By using the plasmids for secretory expression of the Fab(H&L) fragment of the antibody adalimumab constructed in Example 8 (1), pPKSada-FabHL and pPKSada-FabLH, each of the YDK010 strain and the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain was transformed. Each of the obtained transformants was cultured in the MM liquid medium (120 g of glucose, 3 g of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 30 g of ammonium sulfate, 1.5 g of potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 0.03 g of iron sulfate heptahydrate, 0.03 g of manganese sulfate pentahydrate, 450 μg of thiamine hydrochloride, 450 μg of biotin, 0.15 g of DL-methionine, and 50 g of calcium carbonate in a volume of 1 L with water, adjusted to pH 7.0) containing 25 mg/l of kanamycin at 30° C. for 96 hours. After completion of the culture, culture supernatant obtained by centrifuging each culture broth was subjected to non-reduced SDS-PAGE, and then stained with SYPRO Orange (produced by Invitrogen), and secretion amounts of the Fab(H&L) fragments of the antibody adalimumab were compared. As a result, even when any of the secretory expression plasmids was used, the secretion amount of the Fab(H&L) fragment of the antibody adalimumab was significantly improved in the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain compared with that observed for the parent strain YDK010 (FIG. 10). When the N-terminus sequence of the Fab(H&L) protein in the band detected for the transformant obtained from the YDK010ΔPBP1a strain using pPKSada-FabHL was determined with a protein sequencer PPSQ-21A (produced by Shimadzu), both sequences of the N-terminus sequence of the H chain and the N-terminus sequences of the L chain of the Fab fragment of the objective antibody adalimumab were included, and therefore it could be confirmed that the Fab(H&L) fragments of the antibody adalimumab were expressed and secreted to form aggregates in the culture supernatant. Accordingly, it was revealed that the secretion amount of an antibody Fab(H&L) fragment could be improved by using a penicillin-binding protein PBP1a deficient strain in the case of expressing the Fab(H&L) fragment of adalimumab as well as in the case of expressing the Fab(H&L) fragment of trastuzumab. Example 9 Construction of Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP1a Deficient Strain of Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13869 and Secretory Expression of Fab(H&L) Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab (1) Construction of C. glutamicum ATCC13869ΔPBP1a The C. glutamicum ATCC13869 strain was transformed with pBSΔCgl0278, the vector for deleting the gene of the penicillin-binding protein PBP1a constructed in Example 1 (1). Strains were selected from the obtained transformants according to the method described in WO2005/113744 to obtain ATCC13869ΔPBP1a strain deficient in the Cgl0278 gene. (2) Secretory Expression of Fab(H&L) Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab by C. glutamicum ATCC13869ΔPBP1a By using the plasmid for secretory expression of the Fab(H&L) fragment of the antibody trastuzumab constructed in Example 4 (1), pPKStrast-FabH(1-229C)+L, each of the ATCC13869 strain and the ATCC13869ΔPBP1a strain was transformed. Each of the obtained transformants was cultured in the MM liquid medium (120 g of glucose, 3 g of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 30 g of ammonium sulfate, 1.5 g of potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 0.03 g of iron sulfate heptahydrate, 0.03 g of manganese sulfate pentahydrate, 450 μg of thiamine hydrochloride, 450 μg of biotin, 0.15 g of DL-methionine, and 50 g of calcium carbonate in a volume of 1 L with water, adjusted to pH 7.0) containing 25 mg/l of kanamycin at 30° C. for 96 hours. After completion of the culture, culture supernatant obtained by centrifuging each culture broth was subjected to non-reduced SDS-PAGE, and then stained with SYPRO Orange (produced by Invitrogen), and secretion amounts of the Fab(H&L) fragments of the antibody trastuzumab were compared. As a result, in contrast to the case of using the YDK010 strain as the expression host, the secretion amount of the Fab(H&L) fragment of the antibody trastuzumab was not improved even by using a penicillin-binding protein PBP1a deficient strain in the case of using the ATCC13869 strain as the expression host (lanes 3 and 5 of FIG. 11). Example 10 Construction of Cell Surface Layer Protein CspB and Penicillin-Binding Protein PBP1a Double-Deficient Strain of Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC13869 and Secretory Expression of Fab(H&L) Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab The C. glutamicum YDK010 strain, of which the secretion amount of a protein was improved due to the deficiency of the penicillin-binding protein PBP1a, is a cell surface layer protein PS2 (CspB) deficient strain of the C. glutamicum AJ12036 strain (FERM BP-734) (WO2004/029254). Thus, a CspB deficient strain of ATCC13869 and a CspB and PBP1a double-deficient strain of ATCC13869 were constructed, and secretory expressions of Fab(H&L) fragment of the antibody trastuzumab were performed. The nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for the CspB of the ATCC 13869 strain was shown in SEQ ID NO: 97, and the amino acid sequence of the CspB of the ATCC13869 strain was shown in SEQ ID NO: 98. (1) Construction of C. glutamicum ATCC13869ΔCspB and ATCC13869ΔCspBΔPBP1a By PCR using the chromosomal DNA of the C. glutamicum YDK010 strain prepared in a conventional manner (method of Saito and Miura [Biochim Biophys. Acta, 72, 619 (1963)]) as a template, and the DNAs of SEQ ID NOS: 99 and 100 as primers, a DNA fragment of about 2.0 kbp that includes the region of which the gene coding for the CspB had been made deficient was amplified. For PCR, Pyrobest DNA Polymerase (produced by Takara Bio) was used, and the reaction conditions were those of the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. This DNA fragment was inserted into the Sma I site of pBS5T described in WO2006/057450 to obtain a vector pBS5T-ΔcspB for deleting the cspB gene. Then, the C. glutamicum ATCC13869 strain was transformed with the constructed pBS5T-ΔcspB. Strains were selected from the obtained transformants according to the method described in WO2006/057450 to obtain ATCC13869ΔCspB strain deficient in the cspB gene. Then, the C. glutamicum ATCC13869ΔCspB strain was transformed with pBSΔCgl0278, the vector for deleting the gene of the penicillin-binding protein PBP1a constructed in Example 1 (1). Strains were selected from the obtained transformants according to the method described in WO2005/113744 to obtain ATCC13869ΔCspBΔPBP1a strain deficient in both of the cspB gene and the Cgl0278 gene. (2) Secretory Expression of Fab(H&L) Fragment of Antibody Trastuzumab by ATCC13869ΔCspB and ATCC13869ΔCspBΔPBP1a By using the plasmid for secretory expression of the Fab(H&L) fragment of the antibody trastuzumab constructed in Example 4 (1), pPKStrast-FabH(1-229C)+L, each of the ATCC13869ΔCspB strain and the ATCC13869ΔCspBΔPBP1a strain was transformed. Each of the obtained transformants was cultured in the MM liquid medium (120 g of glucose, 3 g of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 30 g of ammonium sulfate, 1.5 g of potassium dihydrogenphosphate, 0.03 g of iron sulfate heptahydrate, 0.03 g of manganese sulfate pentahydrate, 450 μg of thiamine hydrochloride, 450 μg of biotin, 0.15 g of DL-methionine, and 50 g of calcium carbonate in a volume of 1 L with water, adjusted to pH 7.0) containing 25 mg/l of kanamycin at 30° C. for 96 hours. After completion of the culture, culture supernatant obtained by centrifuging each culture broth was subjected to non-reduced SDS-PAGE, and then stained with SYPRO Orange (produced by Invitrogen), and secretion amounts of the Fab(H&L) fragments of the antibody trastuzumab were compared. As a result, the secretion amount of the Fab(H&L) fragment of the antibody trastuzumab was not improved in either the ATCC13869ΔCspB strain or the ATCC13869ΔPBP1a strain, which is a single deficient strain of the CspB or the PBP1a, compared with that observed for the parent strain ATCC 13869, however, the secretion amount of the Fab(H&L) fragment of the antibody trastuzumab was significantly improved in the ATCC13869ΔCspBΔPBP1a strain, which is a double-deficient strain (FIG. 11). Accordingly, it was revealed that the secretion amount of an antibody Fab(H&L) fragment could be improved by using a double-deficient strain of the cell surface layer protein CspB and penicillin-binding protein PBP1a.
