SYSTEM, METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING BLOOD FLOW AND BLOOD VOLUME FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to measurement of electrical signals of a body of a subject and, more particularly, to measurement of electrical signals of the body of the subject so as to determine blood volume or blood volume rate, e.g., stroke volume, cardiac output, brain intra luminal blood volume and the like. Heart diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality in the modem world. Generally, heart diseases may be caused by (i) a failure in the autonomic nerve system where the impulses from the central nervous system control to the heart muscle fail to provide a regular heart rate and/or (ii) an insufficient strength of the heart muscle itself where even though the patient has a regular heart rate, its force of contraction is insufficient. Either way, the amount of blood or the rate at which the blood is supplied by a diseased heart is abnormal and it is appreciated that an assessment of the state of a patient's circulation is of utmost importance. The simplest measurements, such as heart rate and blood pressure, may be adequate for many patients, but if there is a cardiovascular abnormality then more detailed measurements are needed. Cardiac output (CO) is the volume of blood pumped by the heart during a time interval, which is typically taken to be a minute. Cardiac output is the product of heart rate (HR) and the amount of blood which is pumped with each heartbeat, also known as the stroke volume (SV). For example, the stroke volume at rest in the standing position averages between 60 and 80 ml of blood in most adults. Thus, at a resting heart rate of 80 beats per minute the resting cardiac output varies between 4.8 and 6.4 L per min. A common clinical problem is that of hypotension (low blood pressure); this may occur because the cardiac output is low and/or because of low systemic vascular resistance. This problem can occur in a wide range of patients, especially those in intensive care or postoperative high dependency units. In these high risk patients, more detailed monitoring is typically established including measuring central venous pressure via a central venous catheter and continuous display of arterial blood pressure via a peripheral arterial catheter. In addition to the above measurements, the measurement of cardiac output is extremely important. For example, when combined with arterial pressure measurements, cardiac output can be used for calculating the systemic vascular resistance. The measurement of cardiac output is useful both for establishing a patient's initial cardiovascular state and for monitoring the response to various therapeutic interventions such as transfusion, infusion of inotropic drugs, infusion of vasoactive drags (to increase or reduce systemic vascular resistance) or altering heart rate either pharmacologically or by adjusting pacing rate. Several methods of measuring cardiac output are presently known. One such method is known as the Fick method, described by Adolf Fick in 1870. This method is based on the observation that the amount of oxygen picked up by the blood as it passes through the lungs is equal to the amount of oxygen taken up by the lungs during breathing. In Fick's method, one measures the amount of oxygen taken up by the body during respiration and the difference in oxygen concentration between venous and arterial blood and uses these measurements to calculate the amount of blood pumped through the lungs which is equal to the cardiac output. More specifically, in Fick's method the cardiac output equals the ratio between the oxygen consumption and the arteriovenous oxygen content difference. Oxygen consumption is typically measured non-invasively at the mouth, while the blood concentrations are measured from mixed venous and peripheral arterial blood drawings. Oxygen consumption is derived by measuring the volume of an expired gas over a certain period of time and the difference in oxygen concentration between the expired gas and the inspired gas. The Fick method suffers from many drawbacks. First, accurate collection of the gas is difficult unless the patient has an endotracheal tube because of leaks around a facemask or mouthpiece. Second, the analysis of the gas, which is straightforward if the inspired gas is air, is problematic for oxygen enriched air. Third, the arteriovenous oxygen content difference presents a further problem in that the mixed venous (i.e., pulmonary arterial) oxygen content has to be measured and therefore a pulmonary artery catheter is needed to obtain the sample, which may cause complications to the patient. The Fick principle can also be applied with CO2 instead of oxygen, by measuring CO2 elimination which can be determined more easily as compared to oxygen consumption. With this variant of Fick's method, cardiac output is proportional to the change in CO2 elimination divided by the change in end tidal CO2 resulting from a brief rebreathing period. These changes are accomplished and measured by a sensor, which periodically adds a rebreathing volume into the breathing circuit. Although this method improves the ability to perform accurate measurements of gas, it still suffers from most of the above limitations, in particular the limitation related to leaks around the facemask. Another method is by transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) which provides diagnosis and monitoring of a variety of structural and functional abnormalities of the heart. TOE is used to derive cardiac output from measurement of blood flow velocity by recording the Doppler shift of ultrasound reflected from the red blood cells. The time velocity integral, which is the integral of instantaneous blood flow velocities during one cardiac cycle, is obtained for the blood flow in a specific site (e.g., the left ventricular outflow tract). The time velocity integral is multiplied by the cross-sectional area and the heart rate to give cardiac output. Besides being very inaccurate, the method has the following disadvantages: (i) the system may only be operated by a skilled operator; (ii) due to the size of the system's probe, heavy sedation or anaesthesia is needed; (iii) the system is expensive; and (iv) the probe cannot be configured to provide continuous cardiac output readings without an expert operator being present. U.S. Patent No. 6,485,431 discloses a relatively simple method in which the arterial pressure, measured by a pressure cuff or a pressure tonometer, is used for calculating the mean arterial pressure and the time constant of the arterial system in diastole. The compliance of the arterial system is then determined from a table and used for calculating the cardiac output as the product of the mean arterial pressure and compliance divided by a time constant. This method, however, is very inaccurate and it can only provide a rough estimation of the cardiac output. An additional method of measuring cardiac output is called thermodilution. This method is based on a principle in which the cardiac output can be estimated from the dilution of a bolus of saline being at a different temperature from the blood. The thermodilution involves an insertion of a fine catheter into a vein, through the heart and into the pulmonary artery. A thermistor, mounted on the tip of the catheter senses the temperature in the pulmonary artery. A bolus of saline (about 5 ml. in volume) is injected rapidly through an opening in the catheter, located in or near to the right atrium of the heart. The saline mixes with the blood in the heart and temporarily depresses the temperature in the right atrium. Two temperatures are measured simultaneously: the blood temperature is measured by the thermistor sensor on the catheter and the temperature of the saline to be injected is typically measured by means of a platinum temperature sensor. The cardiac output is inversely related to the area under the curve of temperature depression. The placement of the catheter into the pulmonary artery is expensive and has associated risk including: death; infection; hemorrhage; arrhythmias; carotid artery; thoracic duct, vena caval, tracheal, right atrial, right ventricular, mitral and tricuspid valvular and pulmonary artery injury. Little evidence suggests that placement of a pulmonary artery catheter improves survival and several suggest an increase in morbidity and mortality. A non-invasive method, known as thoracic electrical bioimpedance, was first disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,340,867 and has recently begun to attract medical and industrial attention [U.S. Patent Nos. 3,340,867, 4,450,527, 4,852,580, 4,870,578, 4,953,556, 5,178,154, 5,309,917, 5,316,004, 5,505,209, 5,529,072, 5,503,157, 5,469,859, 5,423,326, 5,685,316, 6,485,431, 6,496,732 and 6,511,438; U.S. Patent Application No. 20020193689]. The thoracic electrical bioimpedance method has the advantages of providing continuous cardiac output measurement at no risk to the patient. A typical bioimpedance system includes a tetrapolar array of circumferential band electrodes connected to the subject at the base of the neck and surrounding the circumference of the lower chest, at the level of the xiphoid process. When a constant magnitude alternating current flows through the upper cervical and lower thoracic band electrodes, a voltage, proportional to the thoracic electrical impedance (or reciprocally proportional to the admittance), is measured between the inner cervical and thoracic band electrodes. The portion of the cardiac synchronous impedance change, temporally concordant with the stroke volume, is ascribed solely and uniquely to volume changes of the aorta during expansion and contraction over the heart cycle. A major disadvantage of existing bioimpedance systems is that the bioimpedance detectors utilized in such systems require several consecutive levels of amplifier circuits. Each amplifier circuit undesirably amplifies the input noise from signals detected in a body segment, thereby necessitating an increase in the magnitude of the measurement current to maintain a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio. Multiple amplifier circuits require substantial area on printed circuit boards and utilize numerous circuit components thereby increasing the cost and power consumption of the system. The complexity of multiple amplifier systems decreases the reliability of the systems and increases the frequency of required maintenance. A typical printed circuit board of a bioimpedance system comprises one or more band pass filters, a half-wave rectification circuit and one or more low pass filters. One skilled in the art would appreciate that the noise level is proportional to the bandwidth of the band pass filter. As presently available band pass filters are typically characterized by a frequency ratio of about 5 %, a considerable portion of the noise passes the band pass filter hence being folded into the half-wave rectification circuit. This problem is aggravated by the fact that the typical change in the impedance within the thorax is about 0.1 %, thereby causing a rather low signal-tonoise ratio for such systems. A recognized problem in bioimpedance measurement is the difficulty in separating and differentiating between cardiovascular bioimpedance signals and respiratory bioimpedance signals, where the latter are typically much larger than the former. An optimization method for increasing the efficiency of the bioimpedance measurement is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,870,578. In this method, changes in the electrical resistance caused by respiration are suppressed by a clamping circuit, synchronized with the electrical activity of the heart. The clamping circuit is timed to clamp the voltages in the measuring equipment to a baseline reference voltage in the time preceding the beginning of mechanical systole. The voltage clamping is released during the mechanical systole of the heart so that the changes in the bioimpedance caused by the pumping action of the heart during mechanical systole are measured. Although providing a certain degree of improvement to the efficiency of the measurement, this method still suffers from a rather low signal-to-noise ratio. There is thus a widely recognized need for and it would be highly advantageous to have, a system, method and apparatus for measuring blood flow devoid of the above limitations.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention is of a system, method and apparatus for measuring blood flow in an organ of a subject, which can be used for determining many bloodflow related parameters for the purpose of medical diagnosis and/or treatment. Specifically, the present invention can be used , for determining stroke volume, cardiac output, brain intra luminal blood volume and blood flow in other arteries of the body such as, but not limited to, arteries in the chest, hip, thigh, neck, head, arm, forearm, abdomen, gluteus, leg and foot. The present invention is further of electrodes, which may be used for the purpose of sensing electrical signals of the body of the subject. The electrodes can be used in combination with the system and apparatus of the present invention as well as in combination with other medical devices. In addition, the electrodes of the present invention can be used for other medical procedures. For purposes of better understanding the present invention, as illustrated in Figures 2-9b of the drawings, reference is first made to the construction and operation of a conventional (i.e., prior art) system for determining blood flow as illustrated in Figure 1. Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1 illustrates the conventional system, generally referred to herein as system 10, which includes a radiofrequency generator 12 for generating a periodic high frequency current output in response to a periodic control input signal. System 10 further includes output spot electrodes 14 for carrying current output from radiofrequency generator 12. Electrodes 14 are connected to locations of a human body 13 above and below the heart. Shown in Figure 1 are two output spot electrodes, connected to two pairs of locations, a first pair A and a second pair D, hence form a tetrapolar array of electrodes. Current, generated by radiofrequency generator 12, flows between location pairs A and D and causes a voltage drop on the segment A-D, due to the impedance of body 13. System 10 further includes an electrical bioimpedance detector 15 and four additional electrodes for detecting a voltage signal, between two additional location pairs designated B and C, located respectively in proximity to pairs A and D and, similarly to electrodes 14, form a tetrapolar array of electrodes. Bioimpedance detector 15 is connected to body 13 through two input spot electrodes 17. Detector generates an output signal indicative of the impedance of segment B-C, in response to the voltage signal received by electrodes 17. The voltage signal is proportional to the magnitude of the periodic current and also proportional to the electrical bioimpedance of the tissue between the pairs A and D (or pairs B and C). The radiofrequency generator typically generates a high frequency current a few milliampères Root Mean Square in magnitude and a few tens of kilohertz in frequency. The amplitude of the voltage signal is modulated by changes in conductivity in the body segment. In the thorax, such changes are due to changes in the volume of blood within the thorax and by orientation of erythrocytes as a function of blood flow velocity in major arteries. The voltage signal modulation envelope is a superimposed sum of conductivity changes caused by changes in posture, respiration, cardiac cycle, motion artifacts and electrical noise. The determination of the blood flow is thus by measuring the impedance change, ΛZ and calculating the blood flow therefrom. Typically, however, the value of the impedance change, ΛZ, is smaller than the value of the impedance, Z, by 2-4 orders of magnitude, thus affecting the quality of the measurement of AZ, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio. The noise content of the received signal is reduced by the use of one or more band pass filters, filtering out frequencies below a low threshold and above a high threshold. Nevertheless, the efficiency of known band pass filters is insufficient and the resulting signal still has a substantial amount of the noise content folded therein. While conceiving the present invention it has been hypothesized and while educing the present invention to practice it has been realized that the signal-to-noise ratio may be considerably increased by combining radiofrequency techniques with analog electronics. Hence, according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a system for measuring blood flow in an organ of a subject, generally referred to herein as system Reference is now made to Figure 2, which is a schematic illustration of system 20. System 20 comprises a radiofrequency generator 22, for generating output radiofrequency signals. Generator 22 may be embodied as any radiofrequency generator, such as, but not limited to, radiofrequency generator 12 of system System 20 further comprises a plurality of electrodes 25, which are connected to the skin of subject 21. Electrodes 25 transmit output radiofrequency signals 24, generated by generator 22 and sense input radiofrequency signals 26 originated from the organ of subject 21. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention system 20 may further comprise a bioimpedance detector 29 for detecting a voltage drop on a portion of the body of subject 21 defined by the positions of electrodes 25. In response to the detected voltage, detector 29 preferably generates signals 26 which are indicative of impedance of the respective portion of the body. System 20 further comprise a mixer 28, electrically communicating with generator 22 and at least a portion of electrodes 25, for mixing signals 24 and signals 26, so as to provide a mixed radiofrequency signal 30 being indicative of the blood flow. Signals 24 and 26 may be inputted into mixer 28 through more than one channel, depending on optional analog processing procedures (e.g., amplification) which may be performed prior to the mixing. For example, in one embodiment, both signals 24 and 26 may be inputted into mixer 28 directly from the terminals that are used for transmitting the signals to and from électrodes 25. In another embodiment, signal 26 may be inputted via an additional unit 27, which is designed for processing signal 26. In an additional embodiment, signal 24 may be inputted from generator 22 where certain analog processing procedures are performed prior to the mixing. Mixer 28 may be any known radiofrequency mixer, such as, but not limited to, double-balanced radiofrequency mixer and unbalanced radiofrequency mixer. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, mixed radiofrequency signal 30 is composed of a plurality of radiofrequency signals, which may be, in one embodiment, a radiofrequency sum and a radiofrequency difference. A sum and a difference may be achieved, e.g., by selecting mixer 28 so that signals 24 and signals 26 are multiplied thereby. Since a multiplication between two frequencies is equivalent to a frequency sum and a frequency difference, mixer 28 outputs a signal which is composed of the desired radiofrequency sum and radiofrequency difference. One ordinarily skilled in the art would appreciate that the advantage in the production of a radiofrequency sum and a radiofrequency difference is that whereas the radiofrequency sum includes both the signal, which is indicative of the blood flow and a considerable amount of electrical noise, the radiofrequency difference approximately noise-free. Thus, the present invention provides an efficient technique for minimizing the electrical noise being associated with such an involved measurement in which the effect of interest is smaller than the measured quantity by about 2-4 orders of magnitude System 20 further comprises electronic circuitry 32, constructed and designed to filter out a portion of signal 30 so that a remaining portion 31 of signal characterized by a substantially increased signal-to-noise ratio. Reference is now made to Figure 3, which is a schematic illustration of circuitry 32. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention circuitry 32 comprises a low pass filter 34 to filter out the high frequency content of signal Low pass filter 34 is particularly useful in the embodiment in which mixer 28 outputs a sum and a difference, where low pass filter filters out the radiofrequency sum and leaves the radiofrequency difference, which, as stated, is approximately noise-free. Low pass 34 filter may be designed and constmcted in accordance with the radiofrequency difference of a particular system which employs system A judicious design of filter 34 substantially reduces the noise content of remaining portion 31. In a conventional bioimpedance system, for example, a substantial amount of the noise of the received signal is folded into the remaining signal, which thus characterized by a bandwidth of about 2 kilohertz. It has been found by the inventors of the present invention that by including output radiofrequency signal 24 and by mixing it with input radiofrequency signal 26, the noise in the resulting signal characterized by a bandwidth that is at least one order of magnitude below the noise bandwidth of conventional systems. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, mixer and circuitry 32 are constructed and designed for increasing the signal-to-noise ratio by at least 20 dB, more preferably by 25 dB, most preferably by 30 dB. Circuitry 32 preferably comprises an analog amplification circuit 36 for amplifying remaining portion 31 of signal 30. The construction and design of analog amplification circuit 36 is not limited, provided circuit 36 is capable of amplifying signal 31. A non limiting example of amplification circuit 36 is further detailed herein below in the Examples section that follows. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention circuitry 32 further comprises a digitizer 38 for digitizing signal 31. The digitization of signal 31 useful for further digital processing of the digitized signal, e.g., by a microprocessor. Additionally and preferably, circuitry comprises a differentiator 40 (either a digital differentiator or an analog differentiator) for performing at least one timedifferentiation of the measured impedance to obtain a respective derivative (e.g., a first derivative, a second derivative, etc.) of the impedance. Differentiator 40 may comprise any known electronic functionality (e.g., a chip) that is capable of performing analog or digital differentiation. The time-derivative of the impedance useful, for example, for measuring stroke volume or cardiac output, as further detailed hereinafter. Referring now again to Figure 2, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention system 20 further comprises a data processor 42 for calculating at least one quantity using signal 31. Many blood-volume related quantities may be calculated, such as, but not limited to, a stroke volume, a cardiac output and a brain intra luminal blood volume. System 20 may further comprise a display device 49 for displaying the blood flow and other information, preferably as a function of time. Following is a description of a calculation procedure of the stroke volume and the cardiac output, using the time-derivative of the impedance, d Z/dt. The impedance change, ΛZ, is proportional to the time-derivative of the impedance, Z. Thus, by performing the time-differentiation of the impedance, system provides a useful parameter from which the impedance change, AZ and subsequently the stroke volume or the cardiac output may be determined. More specifically, the stroke volume is given by R (L/Z0)2 TàZ/àt, where R is resistivity of the blood, L is the distance between the electrodes, T is the systolic ejection time and Z0 is the non-varying impedance. Knowing the stroke volume, the cardiac output calculated by multiplying the stroke volume by the heart rate of the subject. The blood flow determination provided by system 20 may be used both for diagnostic and for treatment. Hence, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, system 20 may further comprise a pacemaker 44, communicating with data processor 42. In this embodiment, data processor 42 is preferably programmed to electronically control pacemaker 44 in accordance with the calculated quantity. For example, in one embodiment, data processor 42 calculates the cardiac output and sends signals to pacemaker 44 which controls, substantially in real-time, the heart rate of subject 21, so as to improve the cardiac output. Additionally or alternatively, system 20 may also comprise a cardiac assist device 48, preferably constructed and design for increasing the cardiac output. Cardiac assist devices are known in the art and typically comprise a reinforcing member which restricts an expansion of a portion of the heart tissue, so that the cardiac output is increased. In this embodiment, data processor 42 is preferably programmed to electronically control device 48 in accordance with the calculated cardiac output, so that both the determination and the improvement of the cardiac output are automatically performed by system According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention system 20 may comprise a drug administrating device 46, communicating with data processor 42. Device 46 serves for administrating drugs to subject 21. In this embodiment, data processor 42 is preferably programmed to electronically control device 46, in accordance with the value of the calculated quantity. For example, if the calculated quantity is the brain intra luminal blood volume, then depending on the value of the blood volume, data processor 42 sends signal to device 46 and thereby controls the amount and/or type of medications administered to subject 21. The number of electrodes which are connected to subject 21 is preferably selected so as to substantially decouple the input radiofrequency signals from undesired effects, such as, but not limited to, a posture changes effect, a respiration effect, a motion effect and the like. For any number. of electrodes which are used, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, at least a portion of the electrodes are designed and constructed to so as to have a substantial constant sensitivity to electrical signals transmitted through electrodes, irrespectively of an orientation of the electrodes on the subject. Reference is now made to Figures 4a-h, which are schematic illustrations of electrodes 25 (Figures 4c, 4d, 4g and 4h) and the respective positions to which electrodes 25 are attached (Figures 4a, 4b, 4e and 4f), according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Figures 4c and 4g shows the inner side of electrode 25 and Figures 4d and 4h shows the outer side of electrode Hence, electrodes 25 preferably comprise at least one elongated conducting material 50 constructed and designed to wind at least a portion of an external organ, which may be, for example, a chest, a hip, a thigh, a neck, a head, an arm, a forearm, an abdomen, a gluteus, a leg, a foot and the like. Optionally, electrode 25 may also comprise an attaching material 52 (e.g., velcro, glue and the like) for facilitating the attachment of electrode 25 to subject 21. It is recognized that conventional spot electrodes, which are used, e.g., in bioimpedance systems (see, e.g., Figure 1), are sensitive to the particular position to which the electrodes are attached. This sensitivity is particularly disadvantageous in bioimpedance systems where the signal-to-noise ratio is intrinsically small and the fluctuations caused by such artifacts may be comparable to the entire effect which is to be measured. It is further recognized that the problems associated with the sensitivity to small displacements are aggravated when the number of spot electrodes increases. Specifically, with a tetrapolar array of Figure 1, there are eight spot electrodes each of which contribute to the sensitivity to small displacements, hence increasing the uncertainty of the final measurement. The advantage of the use of electrodes 25, according to the presently preferred embodiment of the invention, is that the signal which is received from the body of subject 21 does not depend on small displacements of the electrodes. In addition, as further detailed herein below, the number of electrodes which are used is substantially smaller than the number which is used in conventional systems. It will be appreciated that smaller number of electrodes (i) reduces the uncertainty factor; (ii) is more easy to attach; and (iii) more comfortable to the patient. Referring to Figures 4a, in one embodiment, one electrode is attached to the neck of subject 21 and two electrodes are attached below the heart. This embodiment may be used, for example, for measuring and determining stroke volume and cardiac output. It is it be understood, however, that other configurations are not excluded for the puipose of determining stroke volume and cardiac output. Specifically, two electrodes may be used. Nevertheless, it was found by the inventors of the present invention, that the motion effects with the use of three electrodes were less pronounced than with the use of two electrodes. The preferred electrodes to be used in this embodiment are shown in Figures 4c (inner side) and 4d (outer side). Referring to Figure 4b, in another embodiment, two electrodes are attached to the neck of subject 21 and two electrodes are attached below the heart. This embodiment may be used, for example, for measuring and determining stroke volume and cardiac output. As demonstrated in the Examples section that follows, the quality of the results is significantly enhanced with the use of four electrodes. The preferred electrodes to be used in this embodiment are shown in Figures 4c (inner side) and 4d (outer side). Referring to Figures 4e-h, in an additional embodiment, two electrodes formed on a single elongated strip may be used for the purpose of determining brain intra luminal blood volume. Specifically, as shown in Figure 4e, a single strip (thus, two electrodes) may be wound around the forehead of subject 21, or alternatively and preferably, two strips (thus, four electrodes) may be adjacently wound around the forehead of subj ect 2 1. It is to be understood that any number of electrodes or connection configurations are not excluded from the present invention. For example, the electrodes shown in Figure 4c-d, the electrodes shown in Figure 4g-h or any other electrodes may be used, in any combination, for measuring blood flow in any artery of the body, such as, but not limited to, the external carotid artery, the internal carotid artery, the ulnar artery, the radial artery, the brachial artery, the common iliac artery, the external iliac artery, the posterior tibial artery, the anterior tibial artery, the peroneal artery, the lateral plantar artery, the medial plantar artery and the deep plantar artery. According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided an apparatus for determining blood flow in an organ of a subject, generally referred to herein as apparatus 60. As further detailed below, apparatus 60 enjoys the property of an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and, as such, apparatus 60 may be used in combination with any bioimpedance system, e.g., system Reference is now made to Figure 5, which is a schematic illustration of apparatus 60. Apparatus 60 has a radioffequency measuring unit 22, capable of transmitting output radiofrequency signals 24 to the organ and receiving input radiofrequency signals of the organ 26. Radiofrequency measuring unit 22 may be any suitable unit which is known, per se, for example, unit 22 may comprise radiofrequency generator 22 and bioimpedance detector 29 as further detailed herein above. Unit 22 is preferably capable of performing analog processing of the signals (e.g., amplification). According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, unit 22 transmits and receives signals through a plurality of electrodes as further detailed herein above. Apparatus 60 further comprises mixer 28 for mixing signals 24 and signals 26, so as to provide a mixed radiofrequency signal 30 as further detailed herein above. As illustrated in Figure 5, signals 24 and 26 may be inputted into mixer 28 either directly from the terminals, which are used for transmitting the signals to and from the organ, or via unit 22. Apparatus 60 further comprises electronic circuitry 32 for filtering out a portion of signal 30 so that a remaining portion 31 of signal 30 is characterized by a substantially increased signal-to-noise ratio, as detailed above. According to an additional aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of measuring blood flow in an organ of a subject, the method comprising the following steps, which are illustrated in the flowchart of Figure 6. Hence, in a first step, designated by Block 72, output radiofrequency signals are generated, e.g., by a radiofrequency generator. In a second step, designated by Block 74, the output radiofrequency signals are transmitting to the organ and input radiofrequency signals are sensed of the organ, e.g., by an array of electrodes. In a third step, designated by Block 76, the output radiofrequency signals and the input radiofrequency signals are mixed, so as to provide a mixed radiofrequency signal being indicative of the blood flow, as further detailed herein above. In a fourth step, designated by Block 78, a portion of the mixed radiofrequency signal is filtered out so as to substantially increase the sigήal-to-noise ratio of a remaining portion thereof as further detailed herein above. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the method may further comprise the following optional steps, where each optional step may be performed independently of the other optional steps in any combination or order. Hence, in one optional step, designated by Block 80 the remaining portion of the mixed radiofrequency signal is analogically amplified; in another optional step, designated by Block 82, the remaining portion of mixed radiofrequency signal digitized; in an additional optional step, designated by Block 84, at least one quantity (℮·g; a stroke volume, a cardiac output and a brain intra luminal blood volume) calculated; in still an additional step, designated by Block 86, at least one timediff℮rentiation is performed, as further detailed herein above. Following are technical preferred values which may be used for selective steps and parts of the embodiments described above. As used herein the term “about” refers to ± 1 0 %. The output radiofrequency signals are preferably from about lOKHz to about 200KHz in frequency and from about lOmV to about 50mV in magnitude; the input radiofrequency signals are preferably about 70KHz in frequency and about 20mV in magnitude; a typical impedance which can be measured by the present embodiments from about 250hms to about 350hms; the resulting signal-to-noise ratio of the present embodiments is at least 40dB; low pass filter 34 is preferably characterized by a cutoff frequency of about 35Hz and digitizer 38 preferably samples the signals at a rate of about 1000 samples per second. Additional objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent to one ordinarily skilled in the art upon examination of the following examples, which are not intended to be limiting. Additionally, each of the various embodiments and aspects of the present invention as delineated herein above and as claimed in the claims section below finds experimental support in the following examples. EXAMPLES Reference is now made to the following examples, which, together with the above descriptions, illustrate the invention in a non limiting fashion. A prototype of a system for measuring blood flow in an organ of a subject according to the above description was constructed. The prototype system includes: (a) a self made radiofrequency generator generating output radiofrequency signals, 70Khz in frequency and 20m V in magnitude; (b) a plurality of electrodes, as described in Figures 4b, 4c, 4e and 4f; and (c) a double balanced mixer, purchased from Mini-Circuits, used for providing a radiofrequency sum and a radiofrequency difference, as detailed above. The prototype system further includes electronic circuitry formed in a printed circuit board. Several electronic circuitries were designed and manufactured, so as to investigate the correlation between the quality of the results, the design of the electronic circuitry and the number of electrodes. The various electronic circuitries are schematically illustrated in Figures 7a-d. Figure 7a shows a block diagram of electronic circuitry to be used with three electrodes (see results of cardiac-output measurements in Example 1, below). The electrodes leads are designated in Figure 7a by Ei, E2 and Ii, where the output radiofrequency signals, generated by the radiofrequency generator (designated OSC), are outputted through Ei and E2 and the input radiofrequency signals, as measured of the body are inputted through fr. The input signals and are channeled through a differential amplifier Gj, a band pass filter BPF and a differential amplifier G2. Similarly, the input signals and are channeled through a differential amplifier G3, a band pass filter BPF and a differential amplifier G4. Once amplified and filtered both input and output signals are mixed by mixer DMB, to form, as stated, a frequency sum and a frequency difference. A low pass filter LPF filters out the frequency sum and the resulting signal (carrying the frequency difference) is further amplified by additional differential amplifiers G5, Gδ and Gη. Once amplified, the signal is digitized by an analog to digital digitizer and passed,, via a USB communication interface to a processing and display unit. Figure 7b shows a block diagram of electronic circuitry to be used with two electrodes of brain intra-luminal blood volume measurements in Example 2, below). As there are only two electrodes E2 and Ii are combined to a single lead Ii. Thus, the input signals and are channeled through a differential amplifier Gi, a band pass filter BPF and a differential amplifier G2. The input signals and are channeled through a differential amplifier G2 and a band pass filter BPF (no additional amplification is performed prior to mixing in this configuration). Once amplified and filtered both input and output signals are mixed by mixer DMB, to form the frequency sum and difference. The low pass filter LPF filters out the frequency sum and the resulting signal is further amplified by additional differential amplifiers G4, G5 and G℮. As in the case of three electrodes, the signal is digitized by an analog to digital digitizer and passed, via a USB communication interface to a processing and display unit. Figure 7c shows a block diagram of electronic circuitry to be used with four electrodes (see results of cardiac-output measurements in Example 3 and brain intraluminal blood volume measurement in Example 4, below). The four leads, designated Ei, E2, Ii and I2, where the output radiofrequency signals, generated by radiofrequency generator OSC, are outputted through Ei and E2 and the input radiofrequency signals, as measured of the body are inputted through Ii and I2. In addition, the four leads, Ei, E2, Ii and I2 are connected to the body through capacitors designated Ci, C2, C3 and C4. The principles of the circuitry of Figure 7c are similar to the principles of the circuitry of Figure 7a with three electrodes. The advantage of the circuitry of Figure 7c is that by using both input leads Ii and I2 (as opposed to one input lead Ii of Figure 7a), effects of impedance differences between the electrodes and the body can be minimized. Specifically, the influence of the voltage drop Ii and I2 is controlled by the characteristic impedance of the differential amplifier G3, which is selected to be sufficiently large so that any impedance changes due to the contact between the body and the electrode is negligible, compared to the impedance of G3. Figure 7d shows a block diagram of the analog amplification circuit, which was used to amplify the radiofrequency signal after the low pass filtering in which the radiofrequency sum was filtered out. Measurement of Stroke Volume and Cardiac Output Using Three Electrodes Three electrodes were connected to a human subject, as shown in Figure 4a. The bioimpedance was measured and was used for determining and monitoring (i) stroke volume; and (ii) cardiac output. Figures 8a-b shows the monitoring results obtained using the prototype system (using the circuitry of Figure 7a) on a time scale of 250 ms/div. Two waveforms are displayed in each of Figures 8a-b, the change in the bioimpedance, ΛZ and its measured time derivative, d(Aζ)/dt, denoted in the following as dZ/dt. The waveforms shown in 8b are in reverse magnification compared to the waveforms shown in 8a. For comparison, Figure 8c shows monitoring results obtained using a conventional system (GE/Cardiodynamic). The waveforms displayed in Figure 8c, are, from top to bottom, the ECG signal, the change in the bioimpedance, AZ, its first derivative, dZ/dt and its second derivative d2Z/d/2. The improvement of the signal-to noise ratio of the present invention (Figures 8a-b) over the conventional system (Figure 8c) is vivid. In the prototype system the signal-to-noise ratio was 50dB, whereas in the conventional system the signal-to-noise ratio was 20dB. EXAMPLE 2 Measurement of Brain Intra Luminal Blood Volume Change and Flow Rate Using Two Electrodes Two electrodes were connected to a human subject, as shown in Figure 4e. The bioimpedance was measured and was used for determining and monitoring brain intra luminal blood volume change and flow rate. Figures 9a-b show the monitoring results obtained using the prototype system (using the circuitry of Figure 7b) on a time scale of 250 ms/div. Two waveforms are displayed in each of Figures 9a-b, the change in the bioimpedance, ΛZ and its measured derivative, dZ/dt, where in Figure 9b, the vertical scale for the curve of ΛZ is twice larger than the respective curve in Figure 9a. As shown in Figures 9a-b, a good signal-to noise ratio of 50dB was obtained for both quantities. The curves of the present example acquire a sharper peak, as compared to Example 1. This phenomenon is consistent with physiological findings, according to which the resistance to blood flow in the brain is substantially lower than the resistance in the thorax. Thus, in the brain, there is only a small delay in the response to the change of blood flow, as compared to the thorax. The quick response to blood flow is manifested by the measured quantities hence the sharp peaks in the curves of Figure 9a-b. EXAMPLE 3 Measurement of Stroke Volume and Cardiac Output Using Four Electrodes Four electrodes were connected to a human subject, as shown in Figure 4b. The bioimpedance was measured and was used for determining and monitoring (i) stroke volume; and (ii) cardiac output. Figure 10 shows the monitoring results obtained using the prototype system (using the circuitry of Figure 7c) on a time scale of 500 ms/div. Two waveforms are displayed in Figure 10, the change in the bioimpedance, AZ and its measured time derivative, d(A2)/dt, denoted in the following as dZ/dt. Comparing Figure 10 and Figures 8a-b, the use of four electrodes (and the electronic circuitry of Figure 7c) significantly improves of the quality of the results. EXAMPLE 4 Measurement of Brain Intra Luminal Blood Volume Change and Flow Rate Using Four Electrodes Two electrodes were connected to a human subject, as shown in Figure 4f. The bioimpedance was measured and was used for determining and monitoring brain intra luminal blood volume change and flow rate. Figure 11 show the monitoring results obtained using the prototype system (using the circuitry of Figure 7c) on a time scale of 500 ms/div. Two waveforms are displayed in Figure 11, the change in the bioimpedance, ΛZ and its measured derivative, dZ/dt. As shown in Figures 1 1, a good signal-to noise ratio of 50dB was obtained for both quantities. As in Example 3 above, a comparison between Figures 1 1 and 9a-b, reveal a significant improvement of the present example (four electrodes and the circuitry of Figure 7c) over Example 2 (two electrodes and the circuitry of Figure 7b).
