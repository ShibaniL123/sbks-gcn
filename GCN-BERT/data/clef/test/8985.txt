BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a shower stall, and more particularly, a shower stall that is door-less and open yet prevents shower water from exiting therefrom during use. 2. Description of the Prior Art Numerous innovations for shower enclosure related devices have been provided in the prior art that will be described. Even though these innovations may be suitable for the specific individual purposes to which they address, however, they differ from the present invention. A FIRST EXAMPLE, U.S. Pat. No. 3,418,665, Issued on Dec. 31, 1968, to Long teaches a shower space extending installation including a space-extending generally U-shaped curtain rod including an elongated portion and legs extending substantially at right angles thereto, attachment apparatus carried by each of the legs in proximity to the elongated portion, and friction bumpers mounted at the end of each leg. The space-extending generally U-shaped curtain rod is connectable to a conventional curtain mounting rod by the attachment apparatus so that the ends of the legs abut against the opposite shower stall wall, and the elongated portion projects laterally outwardly of the conventional curtain rod and shower space. A SECOND EXAMPLE, U.S. Pat. No. 6,061,846, Issued on May 16, 2000, to Peterson teaches a bathtub walk-through insert to be positioned and bonded into a cut-out opening in a sidewall of a bathtub. The insert is generally U-shaped, with a web that rests on a bottom of the cut-out opening and legs that fit against the opposite ends of the cut-out opening. A THIRD EXAMPLE, U.S. Pat. No. 6,178,571, Issued on Jan. 30, 2001, to McAllister teaches a barrier-free shower system having a combined configuration of a drain sump, a drain, and a continuously weighted shower curtain. A series of channels is formed into a threshold of a barrier-free shower enclosure. The series of channels trap water within the shower enclosure and channel the water toward the drain sump. Water is directed to the channels from the base of the shower enclosure and from the continuously weighted shower curtain that hangs directly over the threshold. There is no lip or barrier in the base of the shower at the threshold to keep the continuously weighted shower curtain from billowing out as heat escapes the shower enclosure, so a continuous weight is provided near a lower edge of the continuously weighted shower curtain to keep it positioned over the channels in the threshold. A FOURTH EXAMPLE, U.S. Pat. No. 8,069,507, Issued on Dec. 6, 2011, to Didehvar, et al. teaches a shower curtain support system including a first rod having a first arcuate portion and a first end portion, and a second rod having a second arcuate portion and a second end portion. The second arcuate portion is telescopically mounted within the first arcuate portion. A first end support is removably and pivotably mounted to the first end portion, and a second end support is removably and pivotably mounted to the second end portion. A FIFTH EXAMPLE, U.S. Pat. No. 8,341,775, Issued on Jan. 1, 2013, to Didehvar teaches an adjustable curved double curtain rod shower assembly for hanging and supporting the weight of two shower curtains, attached to the walls of a shower area, and forms a shower enclosure area. The adjustable curved double curtain rod shower assembly includes two adjustable curved curtain rods in a horizontal plane an inner rod and an outer rod. Each rod includes a first and a second tubular section. The first section fits into the second section thereby providing for telescopic adjustment of each of the rods and two end pieces that join the ends of each of the two adjustable rods together, and two end hanging apparatus having pivotably positioned therein the two end pieces. Each of the hanging apparatus is attached to the walls of the shower enclosure, and when shower curtains are attached to each of the rods, an enclosed shower area is formed. A SIXTH EXAMPLE, U.S. Patent No. 2013/0025044, Published on Jan. 31, 2013, to Moyer teaches a door-less shower enclosure system that is a water handling system for human showering. The door-less shower enclosure system is configured in such a way as to fit into an alcove in a bathroom of approximate size as that of a bathtub, and contains and discharges water from a shower head without the use of a physical door. The door-less shower enclosure system includes a prefabricated base with a drain, a glass partition, and a metal crossbar support. The glass partition rests upon the base and is supported at the top by the metal crossbar support that is mounted to the side walls of the alcove. Access to the shower compartment is through a walk-in opening, as opposed to an operable door. A SEVENTH EXAMPLE, U.S. Patent No. 2013/0264240, Published on Oct. 10, 2013, to Wallis teaches an enclosure including a base and a wall assembly. The wall assembly includes a first wall that is selectively movable from a disassembled configuration to an assembled configuration. The first wall is disconnected from the base when in the unassembled configuration, and is coupled to the base when in the assembled configuration, so that the first wall is in a substantially upright configuration. Additionally, the first wall has a first substrate including a plurality of first substrate edges, and a plurality of first ornamental features that are individually affixed to the first substrate, while the first wall is in the disassembled configuration. Further, at least one of the first ornamental features is positioned substantially adjacent to two of the first substrate edges, while the first wall is in the disassembled configuration. It is apparent now that numerous innovations for shower enclosure related devices have been provided in the prior art that adequate for various purposes. Furthermore, even though these innovations may be suitable for the specific individual purposes to which they address, accordingly, they would not be suitable for the purposes of the present invention as heretofore described. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AN OBJECT of the present invention is to provide a doorless spiral shower enclosure that avoids the disadvantages of the prior art. ANOTHER OBJECT of the present invention is to provide a doorless spiral shower enclosure that is simple and inexpensive to manufacture. STILL ANOTHER OBJECT of the present invention is to provide a doorless spiral shower enclosure that is simple to use. BRIEFLY STATED, STILL YET ANOTHER OBJECT of the present invention is to provide a shower stall that is door-less and open yet prevents shower water from exiting therefrom during use. The shower stall includes an enclosure. The enclosure has a door-less and open ingress and egress portion, and a shape that prevents the shower water from exiting through the door-less and open ingress and egress portion of the enclosure during use. The novel features which are considered characteristic of the present invention are set forth in the appended claims.
