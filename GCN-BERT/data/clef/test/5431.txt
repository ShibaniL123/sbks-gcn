81.7: 5-(3,4-difluorobenzyl)-3-isopropyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (compound 81)
Similarly to example 13.4, starting from 45 mg (0.1 mmol) of [5-(3,4-difluorobenzyl)-3-isopropyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid and 39 mg (0.2 mmol) of 3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one (prepared as described in example 16.4), and after purification by silica gel chromatography eluted with a dichloromethane/methanol 97/3 mixture, 35 mg (46%) of 5-(3,4-difluorobenzyl)-3-isopropyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a white solid with a melting point of 224Â° C.
