FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to the use of certain alkoxylated polyamines for improving the primary detergency of detergents or cleaning agents, in particular against soils from preparations containing fruit, during washing of textiles or cleaning of hard surfaces, and detergent and cleaning agents which contain alkoxylated polyamines of this type. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In addition to the ingredients that are indispensable for the washing process, such as surfactants and builder materials, detergents generally contain further components which may be combined under the term “washing aids,” and which include such different active substance groups as foam regulators, anti-redeposition agents, bleaching agents, bleach activators, and dye transfer inhibitors. These types of aids also include substances whose presence enhances the detergency of surfactants, without the need in general for these substances themselves to have surfactant behavior. This similarly applies to cleaning agents for hard surfaces. Such substances are often referred to as detergency enhancers. Alkoxylated polyamines and their use in detergents and cleaning agents are known, for example, from International Patent applications WO 95/32272 A1 and WO 2006/108857 A1. Amphiphilic water-soluble alkoxylated polyamines having an internal polyoxyethylene block and an external polyoxypropylene block are known from International Patent application WO 2006/108856 A1 It has surprisingly been found that ethoxylated and propoxylated polyamines have particularly good properties which enhance the primary detergency when the content of propoxylene groups in the total quantity of alkoxylene groups does not depart from a specified range. The effect is particularly pronounced when the aim is to remove fruit-containing soils. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description of the invention and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and this background of the invention. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Use of polyalkoxylated polyamines which are obtainable by reacting polyamines with ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, wherein the content of propylene oxide in the total quantity of the alkylene oxide in detergents or cleaning agents for enhancing the primary detergency or cleaning power against soils during washing of textiles or cleaning of hard surfaces is 2 mol-% to 18 mol-%. Method for removing soils, in particular due to preparations containing fruit, from textiles or hard surfaces, using a detergent or cleaning agent and polyalkoxylated polyamine which is obtainable by reacting polyamines with ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, wherein the content of propylene oxide in the total quantity of the alkylene oxide is 2 mol-% to 18 mol-%. Detergent or cleaning agent containing polyalkoxylated polyamine which is obtainable by reacting polyamines with ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, wherein the content of propylene oxide in the total quantity of the alkylene oxide is 2 mol-% to 18 mol-%, in particular 0.1% by weight to 10% by weight. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following detailed description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding background of the invention or the following detailed description of the invention. The subject matter of the invention is the use of polyalkoxylated polyamines which are obtainable by reacting polyamines with ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, wherein the content of propylene oxide in the total quantity of the alkylene oxide in detergents or cleaning agents for enhancing the primary detergency or cleaning power against soils, in particular soils from preparations containing fruit, during washing of textiles or cleaning of hard surfaces, is 2 mol-% to 18 mol-%, in particular 8 mol-% to 15 mol-%. A further subject matter of the invention relates to a method for removing soils, in particular due to preparations containing fruit, from textiles or hard surfaces, in which a detergent or cleaning agent and a mentioned polyalkoxylated polyamine are used. This method may be carried out by hand or by machine, using a household washing machine or dishwasher, for example. It is possible for agents, in particular liquid agents, and the active substance to be used at the same time or one after the other. The simultaneous use may be carried out particularly advantageously by employing an agent which contains the active substance. The concentration of the stated polyalkoxylated polyamine in the detergent or cleaning solution, which in particular is aqueous, is preferably 1 mg/L to 500 mg/L, in particular 5 mg/L to 200 mg/L. Within the scope of the present invention and its individual aspects, the polyalkoxylated polyamine involves a polymer having a backbone containing N atoms, the N atoms bearing polyalkoxy groups. The polyamine has primary amino functions at the ends, and in the interior preferably has secondary and tertiary amino functions; the polyamine may optionally have only secondary amino functions in the interior, resulting in a linear, not a branched-chain, polyamine. The ratio of primary to secondary amino groups in the polyamine is preferably in the range of 1:0.5 to 1:1.5, in particular in the range of 1:0.7 to 1:1. The ratio of primary to tertiary amino groups in the polyamine is preferably in the range of 1:0.2 to 1:1, in particular in the range of 1:0.5 to 1:0.8. The polyamine preferably has an average molar mass in the range of 500 g/mol to 50,000 g/mol, in particular 550 g/mol to 5000 g/mol. The average molar masses for other polymeric ingredients stated here and possibly subsequently are weight average molar masses Mw, which in principle are determinable by gel permeation chromatography, using an RI detector, the measurement advantageously being performed against an external standard. The N atoms in the polyamine are preferably separated by alkylene groups containing 2 to 12 C atoms, in particular 2 to 6 C atoms, wherein not all alkylene groups have to have the same number of C atoms. Ethylene groups, 1,2-propylene groups, 1,3-propylene groups, and mixtures thereof are particularly preferred. The primary amino functions in the polyamine may bear one or two polyalkoxy groups, and the secondary amino functions may bear one polyalkoxy group, wherein not every amino function has to be substituted with alkoxy groups. The average number of alkoxy groups for each primary and secondary amino function in the polyalkoxylated polyamine is preferably 1 to 100, in particular 5 to 70. The alkoxy groups in the polyalkoxylated polyamine are propoxy and ethoxy groups which are directly bound to N atoms, and optionally propoxy and ethoxy groups which are bound to propoxy or ethoxy radicals. The polyalkoxylated polyamines are obtainable by reacting polyamines with propylene oxide and ethylene oxide, wherein propylene oxide and ethylene oxide may be used together, or propylene oxide may be used first, followed by ethylene oxide, or ethylene oxide may be used first, followed by propylene oxide. The average number of alkoxy groups for each primary and secondary amino function in the polyalkoxylated polyamine is preferably 1 to 100, in particular 5 to 70. The terminal OH function of at least some of the polyalkoxy substituents may be replaced, if desired, by an alkyl ether function having 1 to 10, in particular 1 to 3, C atoms. Preparations containing fruit are understood to mean preparations made of fruit which are suitable as food, for example marmalades, jams, and jellies. Due to their thickener content and fruit content, these preparations result in soils that are difficult to remove. The polyalkoxylated polyamine is preferably used according to the invention in detergents or cleaning agents in a quantity of 0.1% by weight to 10% by weight, in particular in a quantity of 0.2% by weight to 2% by weight, wherein here and subsequently, unless stated otherwise, the term “% by weight” in each case refers to the weight of the overall detergent or cleaning agent. A further subject matter of the invention therefore relates to a detergent or cleaning agent containing polyalkoxylated polyamine which is obtainable by reacting polyamines with ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, wherein the content of propylene oxide in the total quantity of the alkylene oxide is 2 mol-% to 18 mol-%, in particular 8 mol-% to 15 mol-%. Detergents or cleaning agents which contain an active substance to be used according to the invention or which are used together with same or used in the method according to the invention may contain all other customary components of such agents which do not interact adversely with the active substance according to the invention. The detergent or cleaning agent preferably contains an active substance as defined above in quantities of at least 0.1% by weight, in particular 0.2% by weight to 2% by weight. It has surprisingly been found that these types of active substances positively influence the effect of certain other detergent and cleaning agent ingredients, and that conversely, the effect of the active substance is even further intensified by certain other ingredients. These effects appear in particular in synthetic anionic surfactants of the sulfate and sulfonate type, for which reason the use of at least these ingredients, and optionally one or more of the named further ingredients, together with the active substance to be used according to the invention is preferred. An agent which contains an active substance to be used according to the invention or which is used together with same or used in the method according to the invention preferably contains synthetic anionic surfactants of the sulfate and sulfonate type in quantities of preferably not greater than 20% by weight, in particular 0.1% by weight to 18% by weight, in each case based on the overall agent. Synthetic anionic surfactants which are particularly suitable for use in these types of agents include alkyl and/or alkenyl sulfates containing 8 to 22 C atoms which bear an alkali-, ammonium-, or alkyl- or hydroxyalkyl-substituted ammonium ion as countercation. The derivatives of the fatty alcohols containing in particular 12 to 18 C atoms and their branched-chain analogs, the so-called oxo alcohols, are preferred. The alkyl and alkenyl sulfates may be prepared in a known manner by reacting the corresponding alcohol component with a customary sulfating reagent, in particular sulfur trioxide or chlorosulfonic acid, and subsequent neutralization with alkali-, ammonium-, or alkyl- or hydroxyalkyl-substituted ammonium bases. Surfactants of the sulfate type which are particularly preferably usable include the above-mentioned sulfated alkoxylation products of the named alcohols, so-called ether sulfates. Such ether sulfates preferably contain 2 to 30, in particular 4 to 10, ethylene glycol groups per molecule. Suitable anionic surfactants of the sulfonate type include α-sulfo esters which are obtainable by reaction of fatty acid esters with sulfur trioxide and subsequent neutralization, in particular the sulfonation products derived from fatty acids containing 8 to 22 C atoms, preferably 12 to 18 C atoms, and linear alcohols containing 1 to 6 C atoms, preferably 1 to 4 C atoms, and the sulfo fatty acids which result from same by formal saponification. Usable anionic surfactants also include the salts of sulfosuccinic acid esters, also referred to as alkylsulfosuccinates or dialkylsulfosuccinates, and the monoesters or diesters of sulfosuccinic acid with alcohols, preferably fatty alcohols and in particular ethoxylated fatty alcohols. Preferred sulfosuccinates contain C8 to C18 fatty alcohol radicals or mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred sulfosuccinates contain an ethoxylated fatty alcohol radical, which in itself represents a nonionic surfactant. Sulfosuccinates whose fatty alcohol radicals are derived from ethoxylated fatty alcohols with a narrow homolog distribution are once again particularly preferred. Alkylbenzene sulfonate is another suitable synthetic anionic surfactant. A further embodiment of the agents includes the presence of nonionic surfactant, selected from fatty alkyl polyglycosides, fatty alkyl polyalkoxylates, in particular fatty alkyl ethoxylates and/or propoxylates, fatty acid polyhydroxyamides, and/or ethoxylation and/or propoxylation products of fatty alkylamines, vicinal diols, fatty acid alkyl esters, and/or fatty acid amides and mixtures thereof, in particular in a quantity in the range of 2% by weight to 25% by weight. Suitable nonionic surfactants include the alkoxylates, in particular the ethoxylates and/or propoxylates, of saturated or singly to multiply unsaturated linear or branched-chain alcohols containing 10 to 22 C atoms, preferably 12 to 18 C atoms. The alkoxylation number of the alcohols is generally between 1 and 20, preferably between 3 and 10. The alkoxylates may be produced in a known manner by reacting the corresponding alcohols with the appropriate alkylene oxides. The derivatives of the fatty alcohols are particularly suitable, although their branched-chain isomers, in particular so-called oxo alcohols, may also be used for producing usable alkoxylates. Accordingly, the alkoxylates, in particular the ethoxylates, of primary alcohols having linear, in particular dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, or octadecyl, radicals and mixtures thereof are usable. Appropriate alkoxylation products of alkylamines, vicinal diols, and carboxylic acid amides which correspond to the named alcohols with regard to the alkyl portion are also usable. Furthermore, the ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide insertion products of fatty acid alkyl esters, and also fatty acid polyhydroxyamides are suitable. So-called alkyl polyglycosides which are suitable for incorporation into the agents according to the invention are compounds of the general formula (G)n-OR12, in which R12 means an alkyl or alkenyl radical containing 8 to 22 C atoms, G means a glycose unit, and n means a number between 1 and 10. The glycoside component (G)n is oligomers or polymers of naturally occurring aldose or ketose monomers, which include in particular glucose, mannose, fructose, galactose, talose, gulose, altrose, allose, idose, ribose, arabinose, xylose, and lyxose. The oligomers made up of such glycosidically linked monomers are characterized not only by the type but also by the number of sugars which they contain, the so-called degree of oligomerization. The degree of oligomerization n generally assumes fractional numbers as values to be analytically determined, and has values between 1 and 10, and for the preferably used glycosides, has a value less than 1.5, in particular between 1.2 and 1.4. Glucose is a preferred monomer structural unit since it is readily available. The alkyl or alkenyl portion R12 of the glycosides preferably likewise comes from readily available derivatives of renewable raw materials, in particular fatty alcohols, although their branched-chain isomers, in particular so-called oxo alcohols, may also be used for producing usable glycosides. In particular the primary alcohols having linear octyl, decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, or octadecyl radicals and mixtures thereof are therefore usable. Particularly preferred alkyl glycosides contain a coconut fatty alkyl radical, i.e., mixtures of essentially R12=dodecyl and R12=tetradecyl. In agents which contain an active substance that is used according to the invention or is employed within the scope of the use according to the invention, nonionic surfactant is preferably contained in quantities of 1% by weight to 30% by weight, in particular 1% by weight to 25% by weight, wherein quantities in the upper part of this range are more preferably found in liquid detergents, and particle-form detergents more preferably contain smaller quantities of up to 5% by weight. Soaps are further optional surfactant ingredients that are suitable, wherein saturated fatty acid soaps such as the salts of lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, or stearic acid, and soaps derived from natural fatty acid mixtures, for example coconut, palm kernel, or tallow fat acids, are suitable. Particularly preferred are soap mixtures composed of 50% by weight to 100% by weight of saturated C12-C18 fatty acid soaps and up to 50% by weight of oleic acid soap. Soap is preferably contained in quantities of 0.1% by weight to 5% by weight. However, even higher soap quantities of generally up to 20% by weight may be contained, in particular in liquid agents which contain an active substance used according to the invention. The agents may also contain betaines and/or cationic surfactants, if desired, which—if present—are preferably used in quantities of 0.5% by weight to 7% by weight. Among these, esterquats are particularly preferred. The agents may contain peroxygen-based bleaching agents if desired, in particular in quantities in the range of 5% by weight to 70% by weight, and optionally bleach activator, in particular in quantities in the range of 2% by weight to 10% by weight. Suitable bleaching agents are preferably the peroxygen compounds generally used in detergents, for example percarboxylic acids such as perdodecanoic acid or phthaloylamino peroxycaproic acid, and hydrogen peroxide, alkali perborate, which may be present as the tetra- or monohydrate, percarbonate, and perpyrophosphate and persilicate, which are generally present as alkali salts, in particular as sodium salts. In detergents which contain an active substance used according to the invention, these types of bleaching agents are preferably present in quantities of up to 25% by weight, in particular up to 15% by weight, and particularly preferably 5% by weight to 15% by weight, in each case based on the overall agent, in particular percarbonate being used. The optionally present component of the bleach activators includes the customarily used N- or O-acyl compounds, for example multiply acylated alkylenediamines, in particular tetraacetylethylenediamine, acylated glycolurils, in particular tetraacetylglycoluril, N-acylated hydantoins, hydrazides, triazoles, urazoles, diketopiperazines, sulfuryl amides, and cyanurates, in addition to carboxylic acid anhydrides, in particular phthalic anhydride, carboxylic acid esters, in particular sodium isononanoyl phenol sulfonate, and acylated sugar derivatives, in particular pentaacetyl glucose, as well as cationic nitrile derivatives such as trimethylammonium acetonitrile salts. To avoid interaction with the peroxygen compounds during storage, the bleach activators may have been coated with casing substances and/or granulated in a known manner, wherein tetraacetylethylenediamine, granulated with the aid of carboxymethylcellulose and having average grain sizes of 0.01 mm to 0.8 mm, granulated 1,5-diacetyl-2,4-dioxohexahydro-1,3,5-triazine, and/or trialkylammonium acetonitrile prepared in particle form are particularly preferred. These types of bleach activators are preferably contained in detergents in quantities of up to 8% by weight, in particular 2% by weight to 6% by weight, in each case based on the overall agent. In a further embodiment, the agent contains water-soluble and/or water-insoluble builders, in particular selected from alkali aluminosilicate, crystalline alkali silicate having a modulus greater than 1, monomeric polycarboxylate, and polymeric polycarboxylate and mixtures thereof, in particular in quantities in the range of 2.5% by weight to 60% by weight. The agent preferably contains 20% by weight to 55% by weight of water-soluble and/or water-insoluble, organic and/or inorganic builders. The water-soluble organic builder substances include in particular those from the class of polycarboxylic acids, in particular citric acid and sugar acids, and the polymeric (poly-)carboxylic acids, in particular the polycarboxylates obtainable by oxidation of polysaccharides, and polymeric acrylic acids, methacrylic acids, maleic acids, and mixed polymers thereof, which may also contain small quantities of polymerizable substances without carboxylic acid functionality which are polymerized in. The relative molecular mass of the homopolymers of unsaturated carboxylic acids is generally between 5000 g/mol and 200,000 g/mol, and the relative molecular mass of the copolymers is generally between 2000 g/mol and 200,000 g/mol, preferably 50,000 g/mol to 120,000 g/mol, based on the free acid. A particularly preferred acrylic acid-maleic acid copolymer has a relative molecular mass of 50,000 g/mol to 100,000 g/mol. Suitable compounds of this class, although less preferred, are copolymers of acrylic acid or methacrylic acid with vinyl ethers such as vinyl methyl ether, and vinyl esters, ethylene, propylene, and styrene, in which the acid content is at least 50% by weight. Terpolymers containing two carboxylic acids and/or salts thereof as monomers, and containing vinyl alcohol and/or a vinyl alcohol derivative or a carbohydrate as third monomer, may also be used as water-soluble organic builder substances. The first acid monomer or salt thereof is derived from a monoethylenically unsaturated C3-C8 carboxylic acid, and preferably from a C3-C4 monocarboxylic acid, in particular from (meth-)acrylic acid. The second acid monomer or salt thereof may be a derivative of a C4-C5 dicarboxylic acid, maleic acid being particularly preferred. The third monomer unit in this case is formed by vinyl alcohol and/or preferably an esterified vinyl alcohol. In particular, vinyl alcohol derivatives which represent an ester of short-chain carboxylic acids, for example C1-C4 carboxylic acids, with vinyl alcohol are preferred.

In this regard, the quantities as well as the weight ratios are based on the acids. The second acid monomer or salt thereof may also be a derivative of an allylsulfonic acid that is substituted in the 2-position with an alkyl radical, preferably a C1-C4 alkyl radical, or an aromatic radical which is preferably derived from benzene or benzene derivatives. Preferred terpolymers contain 40% by weight to 60% by weight, in particular 45% by weight to 55% by weight, of (meth)acrylic acid and/or (meth)acrylate, particularly preferably acrylic acid and/or acrylate, 10% by weight to 30% by weight, preferably 15% by weight to 25% by weight, of methallylsulfonic acid and/or methallyl sulfonate, and 15% by weight to 40% by weight, preferably 20% by weight to 40% by weight, of a carbohydrate as third monomer. This carbohydrate may be a mono-, di-, oligo-, or polysaccharide, for example, with mono-, di-, or oligosaccharides being preferred and sucrose being particularly preferred. Due to the use of the third monomer, predetermined breaking points which are responsible for the good biodegradability of the polymer are presumably incorporated into the polymer. These terpolymers generally have a relative molecular mass between 1000 g/mol and 200,000 g/mol, preferably between 2000 g/mol and 50,000 g/mol, and in particular between 3000 g/mol and 10,000 g/mol. The terpolymers may be used in particular for producing liquid agents in the form of aqueous solutions, preferably in the form of 30 to 50% by weight aqueous solutions. All of the named polycarboxylic acids are generally used in the form of their water-soluble salts, in particular their alkali salts. These types of organic builder substances are preferably contained in quantities of up to 40% by weight, in particular up to 25% by weight, and particularly preferably 1% by weight to 5% by weight. Quantities close to the stated upper limit are preferably used in agents in paste or liquid form, in particular in agents containing water. As water-insoluble, water-dispersible inorganic builder materials, in particular crystalline or amorphous alkali aluminosilicates are used in quantities of up to 50% by weight, preferably not greater than 40% by weight, and in liquid agents are used in particular in quantities of 1% by weight to 5% by weight.

The alkali silicates which are usable in the agents as builders preferably have a molar ratio of alkali oxide to SiO2 of less than 0.95, in particular 1:1.1 to 1:12, and may be present in amorphous or crystalline form. Preferred alkali silicates are sodium silicates, in particular amorphous sodium silicates, having a Na2O:SiO2 molar ratio of 1:2 to 1:2.8. Such amorphous alkali silicates are commercially available under the name Portil®, for example. Within the scope of the production, amorphous alkali silicates having a Na2O:SiO2 molar ratio of 1:1.9 to 1:2.8 are preferably added as a solid, and not in the form of a solution. Crystalline layered silicates of the general formula Na2SixO2x+1.y H2O, in which x, the so-called modulus, is a number from 1.9 to 4 and y is a number from 0 to 20, and preferred values of x are 2, 3, or 4, are preferably used as crystalline silicates, which may be present alone or in a mixture with amorphous silicates.

Preferred crystalline layered silicates are those in which in the stated general formula x assumes the values 2 or 3. In particular, β- as well as δ-sodium disilicates (Na2Si2O5.y H2O) are preferred. Crystalline alkali silicates of the above-mentioned general formula, in which x means a number from 1.9 to 2.1, which are produced from amorphous alkali silicates and are practically water-free may also be used in agents which contain an active substance to be used according to the invention. In a further preferred embodiment of agents according to the invention, a crystalline sodium layered silicate having a modulus of 2 to 3 is used, which may be produced from sand and soda. Crystalline sodium silicates having a modulus in the range of 1.9 to 3.5 are used in a further preferred embodiment of detergents which contain an active substance that is used according to the invention. Their content of alkali silicates is preferably 1% by weight to 50% by weight, and in particular 5% by weight to 35% by weight, based on water-free active substance. If alkali aluminosilicate, in particular zeolite, is present as additional builder substance, the content of alkali silicate is preferably 1% by weight to 15% by weight, and in particular 2% by weight to 8% by weight, based on water-free active substance.

The acid on which the Ph radical is based is preferably selected from terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, phthalic acid, trimellitic acid, mellitic acid, the isomers of sulfophthalic acid, sulfoisophthalic acid, and sulfoterephthalic acid, and mixtures thereof. If the acid groups of the named compounds are not part of the ester bonds in the polymer, they are preferably present in the form of a salt, in particular an alkali or ammonium salt. Of these, the sodium and potassium salts are particularly preferred. If desired, instead of the HOOC-Ph-COOH monomer, small quantities, in particular not more than 10 mol-%, based on the content of Ph having the meaning stated above, of other acids which have at least two carboxyl groups may be contained in the dirt-loosening polyester. These acids include, for example, alkylene and alkenylene dicarboxylic acids such as malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, and sebacic acid. The preferred diols HO—(CHR11—)aOH include those in which R11 is hydrogen and a is a number from 2 to 6, and those in which a has the value 2 and R11 is selected from among hydrogen and the alkyl radicals containing 1 to 10, in particular 1 to 3, C atoms. Of the latter-referenced diols, those of formula HO—CH2—CHR11—OH, in which R11 has the meaning stated above, are particularly preferred. Examples of diol components are ethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,8-octanediol, 1,2-decanediol, 1,2-dodecanediol, and neopentyl glycol.

If desired, the polyesters may also be closed by end groups, wherein alkyl groups containing 1 to 22 C atoms and esters of monocarboxylic acids are suitable end groups. The end groups which are bound via ester bonds may be based on alkyl, alkenyl, and arylmonocarboxylic acids containing 5 to 32 C atoms, in particular 5 to 18 C atoms. These acids include valeric acid, caproic acid, enanthic acid, caprylic acid, pelargonic acid, capric acid, undecanoic acid, undecenoic acid, lauric acid, lauroleic acid, tridecanoic acid, myristic acid, myristoleic acid, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, petroselinic acid, petroselaidic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolaidic acid, linolenic acid, eleostearic acid, arachic acid, gadoleic acid, arachidonic acid, behenic acid, erucic acid, brassidinic acid, clupanodonic acid, lignoceric acid, cerotic acid, melissic acid, and benzoic acid, which may bear 1 to 5 substituents with a total of up to 25 C atoms, in particular 1 to 12 C atoms, for example tert-butylbenzoic acid.

The hydroxymonocarboxylic acids themselves may be bound to one another via their hydroxyl group and their carboxyl group, and may therefore be multiply present in an end group. The number of hydroxymonocarboxylic acid units per end group, i.e., the degree of oligomerization of hydroxymonocarboxylic acid, is preferably in the range of 1 to 50, in particular 1 to 10. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, polymers of ethylene terephthalate and polyethylene oxide terephthalate, in which the polyethylene glycol units have molar weights of 750 g/mol to 5000 g/mol, and the molar ratio of ethylene terephthalate to polyethylene oxide terephthalate is 50:50 to 90:10, may be used in combination with an active substance that is essential to the invention. The dirt-loosening polymers are preferably water-soluble, wherein the term “water-soluble” is understood to mean a solubility of at least 0.01 g, preferably at least 0.1 g, of the polymer per liter water at room temperature and pH 8. However, under these conditions, polymers which are preferably used have a solubility of at least 1 g per liter, in particular at least 10 g per liter. The production of solid agents according to the invention poses no difficulties, and may be carried out in a known manner, for example by spray drying or granulation; enzymes and other possibly thermally sensitive ingredients, such as bleaching agents, may optionally be added separately at a later time. For producing agents according to the invention having an increased bulk density in particular in the range of 650 g/L to 950 g/L, a method having an extrusion step is preferred. For producing agents according to the invention in tablet form, which may be monophasic or polyphasic, one-colored or multi-colored, and which may consist of one layer or multiple layers, in particular two layers, the preferred procedure is to mix all components, optionally for one layer each, in a mixer, and to press the mixture using conventional tablet presses, for example eccentric presses or rotary presses, with pressing forces in the range of approximately 50 to 100 kN, preferably 60 to 70 kN. In particular for multi-layer tablets it may be advantageous when at least one layer is prepressed. This is preferably carried out at pressing forces between 5 and 20 kN, in particular 10 to 15 kN. Tablets are thus easily obtained which are resistant to breakage but still sufficiently quick-dissolving under the usage conditions, with breaking strengths and bending strengths of normally 100 to 200 N, but preferably above 150 N. A tablet produced in this way preferably has a weight of 10 g to 50 g, in particular 15 g to 40 g. The rough shape of the tablets is arbitrary, and may be round, oval, or polygonal, whereby intermediate shapes are also possible. Corners and edges are advantageously rounded. Round tablets preferably have a diameter of 30 mm to 40 mm. In particular the size of polygonal or square tablets, which are introduced mainly via the dosing device of the dishwasher, for example, is dependent on the geometry and the volume of this dosing device. Examples of preferred embodiments have a base area of (20 to 30 mm)×(34 to 40 mm), in particular 26×36 mm or 24×38 mm. Liquid or paste-like agents according to the invention in the form of solutions containing customary solvents, in particular water, are generally produced by simple mixing of the ingredients, which may be added as the substance or as a solution to an automatic mixer.
