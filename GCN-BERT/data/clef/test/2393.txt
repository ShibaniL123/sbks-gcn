Patent Application ΡΤ031979 “New modified silicone oil for low temperature cure die casting lubricants” This invention relates to new silicones, processes for the production thereof and their uses, e.g., as die casting lubricants. State of the art silicone oils used in pressure die casting release agents are well known for their high temperature stability and excellent release properties. These silicone oils form a solid film on the die at temperatures above 225°C. Formation of such a solid film on the die by curing at these temperatures allows the lubricant to practice its release function on the complete surface of the die. However, in various cases the die temperature does not exceed the curing temperature of the silicone oil, thus preventing the formation of a solid silicone film on the colder parts of the die with a concomitant decrease in release properties of the pressure die casting release agent. It is an object of the present invention to provide an alternative pressure die casting release agent which has the same high temperature stability, lubricating properties and casting release rates as state of the art die casting release agents with the additional benefit of solid film formation at lower temperatures at or above 170°C while being unreactive under ambient conditions during storage or transport. This is advantageous since a mould can have colder spots resulting from its design and the type of casting, the efficiency of internal cooling, the thickness of the casting on specific spots (thin parts of the casting give of less energy to the die), and the efficiency of external cooling by spraying of lubricant on specific spots. The temperature of a mould can intentionally be kept cooler to influence casting quality, to cast with lower melting metals/alloys, and to lower temperature on hot-spots by reducing temperature of complete die. In a first aspect, the present invention thus relates to a mixture of polyalkylsiloxanes obtainable through a hydrosilylation reaction wherein a mixture of ethylenically unsaturated olefins consisting of a) 1-100 mol %, preferably 10-30 mol% of one or more polyene(s) having one terminal double bond which is either monosubstituted or geminal disubstituted and one or more tri- or tetrasubstituted double bond(s), wherein said terminal double bond and said one or more trior tetrasubstituted double bond(s) are preferably non-conjugated, wherein said polyene(s) are preferably terpenes, more preferably (R)-limonene, (S)-limonene or a mixture thereof, and b) 0-99 mol %, preferably 70-90 mol% of monounsaturated olefins with 6 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably 1-dodecene, is reacted with an amount of one or more polyalkylhydrosiloxanes in the presence of a hydrosilylation catalyst while each polyalkylhydrosiloxane comprises a repeating unit according to the general structure (I): Η I Si 0 (I) R1 L J η with η indicating the number of repeating units being in a range of from 5 to 10,000, preferably 10 to 100, more preferably 25; with the residue R1 being selected from linear or branched alkyl groups with less than 6 carbon atoms. In another aspect, the present invention relates to a polyalkylsiloxane comprising repeating units according to general structure (II): R1 Si O (Π) R2 _ η wherein η indicates the number of repeating units comprised in the polyalkylsiloxane, wherein η is an integer of 5 to 10,000 and residue R1 is selected from the group consisting of linear or branched alkyl groups with less than 6 carbon atoms, wherein a) in 1-100 % of the repeating units R2 is selected from the group consisting of linear or branched or cyclic alkenyl groups, obtained by the addition of a Si-H bond across the terminal double bond of a polyene having one terminal double bond which is either monosubstituted or geminal disubstituted and one or more tri- or tetrasubstituted double bond(s), wherein said terminal double bond and said one or more tri- or tetrasubstituted double bond(s) are preferably non-conjugated, wherein said polyene is preferably a terpene, more preferably (R)-limonene, (S)-limonene or a mixture thereof, in a hydrosilylation reaction, b) in 0-99 % of the repeating units R2 is selected from the group consisting of linear or branched alkyl groups with 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and c) in 0-10 % of the repeating units, preferably less than 10 %, R2 is Η. In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a water-based composition suitable for use in metal casting processes as a mold release agent comprising a) 1 -50 wt.-% of a mixture of polyalkylsiloxanes or polyalkylsiloxane as defined above, b) 1-15 wt.-% of a non-ionic surfactant having a HLB value of at least 8, and c) 0-30 wt.-% of waxes, mineral oils and/or natural/synthetic oils. In another aspect, the present invention relates to the use of polyalkylsiloxanes as a mold release agent in a metal casting process, wherein i) the polyalkylsiloxanes are a mixture of polyalkylsiloxanes as defined herein, ii) the polyalkylsiloxanes are polyalkylsiloxanes as defined herein, or iii) the polyalkylsiloxanes comprise a repeating unit according to the following general structure (II): R1 --Si O (Π) R2 J η wherein η indicates the number of repeating units being in a range of from 5 to 10,000; wherein for each repeating unit the residue R1 is independently selected from linear alkyl groups with less than 6 carbon atoms; and wherein for each repeating unit the residue R2 is independently selected from (a) hydrogen or (b) linear or branched alkyl groups having 6 to 15 carbon atoms or (c) a linear or branched or cyclic alkenyl group, obtained by the addition of a Si-H bond across the terminal double bond of a polyene having one terminal double bond which is either monosubstituted or geminal disubstituted and one or more tri- or tetrasubstituted double bond(s), wherein said terminal double bond and said one or more tri- or tetrasubstituted double bond(s) are preferably non-conjugated, wherein said polyene is preferably a terpene, more preferably (R)-limonene, (S)limonene or a mixture thereof, in a hydrosilylation reaction, while the fraction of repeating units with a residue R2 being hydrogen is less than 0.1, being an alkenyl residue, preferably a terpene residue, more preferably a (R)-limonene residue, (S)-limonene residue or a mixture thereof, is in a range of from 0.01-1.0, and being a linear or branched alkyl group having 6 to 15 carbon atoms is in a range of from 0-0.99. Further embodiments are defined in the appended claims. The inventors of the present invention surprisingly found that silicone oil prepared by functionalization of polymethylhydrosiloxane with a mixture of mono unsaturated olefins with 6 to 15 carbon atoms, especially 1-dodecene, and one or more polyene(s) having one terminal double bond which is either monosubstituted or geminal disubstituted and one or more tri- or tetrasubstituted double bond(s), wherein said terminal double bond and said one or more tri- or tetrasubstituted double bond(s) are preferably non-conjugated, wherein said polyene(s) are preferably terpenes, more preferably (R)-limonene, (S)-limonene or a mixture thereof, results in silicone oil, which cures (forms a film) at low (> 170 °C) temperatures. This makes the silicone oil especially suitable for application on cooler casting dies or in magnesium casting. Furthermore, the one or more polyenes attached to the polymer backbone allow for cross-linking of the polysiloxane chains by an oxidative non-metal catalyzed process. The curing sets in at a temperature above 170 °C while regular silicone oil starts curing at temperatures above 225 °C, making this new silicone oil ideal for film formation on cooler casting dies and/or cooler parts of the casting die. The curing is preferably completed at below 190°C (fora 10 pm layer). The silicone oil is stable at room temperature and the high temperature stability is comparable or better compared to state of the art silicone oils. It was found that the one terminal double bond (either monosubstituted or geminal disubstituted) of the polyenes of the invention is active and selective in the hydrosilylation reaction while the one (or more) tri- or tetrasubstituted double bond(s) are active in oxidative cross coupling reactions (required for low temperature cure), but do not cross link via hydrosilylation (unwanted cross linking during silicone oil synthesis). In contrast to the polyenes used according to the invention, alfa-omega dienes, such as 1,7-octadiene, were found to result in undesirable cross-linking by hydrosilylation during the silicone oil synthesis. Further, lower activity in desirable oxidative cross-linking (higher Τ required) was observed when disubstituted alkenes (instead of tri or tetra) were employed (e.g. coupling of polybutadiene). Preferred polyenes are those that are derived from renewable sources, for example terpenes, in particular limonene, which is preferred due to its low costs and production from renewable sources. The new and improved polyalkylsiloxane derivatives may be in the form of silicone oil. The term “silicone oil” relates to compounds comprising Si-O-Si units being liquid at 25°C that have a water-miscibility of less than 1g Η2Ο per 1kg of the oil at 25 °C. This compound may be directly used as a lubricant or included in a release agent for pressure die casting. The new polyalkylsiloxane derivatives are particularly advantageous in water-based compositions. However, a second field of application is use of the new modified silicone oil in casting processes where the silicone oil is applied directly (not as emulsion) on the mold.

Examples Example 1: To a mixture of polymethylhydrosiloxane with the average formula (CH3)3SiO(CH3HSiO)25Si(CH3)3 (80 g, 1.205 mol free Si-H) and 1-dodecene (15.41 g, 0.092 mol) was added 4 ppm of a FhPtCle solution in isopropanol (0.145 mL, 17.1 mg/mL). The mixture was heated to 80 °C resulting in an exotherm heating the mixture to 140 °C. 1-dodecene (138.7 g, 0.82 mol) was added at such a rate to keep the temperature 140-150°C. Subsequently, limonene (31.2 g, 0.23 mol) was added dropwise. After complete addition the mixture was heated at 150 °C for 1.5 hours. FTIR analysis showed <5% SiH. The viscosity of the product was 1500 mPa.s. A 10 pm layer of the prepared silicone oil was applied on a steel plate followed by heating of the plate for 2 minutes at temperatures between 160 and 230 °C under aerobic conditions. Film formation was observed for the new low curing silicone oil and compared to state of the art silicone oils. Formation of a polymeric film on the metal surface was observed at temperatures of 170 °C and higher for the silicone oil of the invention. All other tested silicone oils (prior art silicone oils) showed film formation at temperatures of 225 °C and higher. Mixtures of the silicone oil with light petroleum distillates in weight ratios of 10:1 to 1:3 afforded very low viscous oils with identical curing temperatures compared to the pure oil. These low viscous oils allow application of pure oils on the die by state of the art oil spraying equipment used in the pressure die casting industry. Thermogravimetric analysis of the silicone oils showed a decomposition temperature of the low curing silicone oil which was identical or slightly better compared to regular silicone oil. The material was fully decomposed above 520 °C. 1.
