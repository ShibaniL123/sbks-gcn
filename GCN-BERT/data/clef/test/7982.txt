Step 2. tert-Butyl 5-(4-(2-chloroacetamido)-2,6-difluorophenyl)-3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1-carboxylate
To a solution of tert-butyl 5-(4-amino-2,6-difluorophenyl)-3-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine-1-carboxylate (385 mg, 0.903 mmol) and 2-chloroacetic acid (85 mg, 0.903 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (4 mL) were added N,N-diisopropylethylamine (315 Î¼L, 1.8 mmol) and N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)uronium hexafluorophosphate (515 mg, 1.35 mmol). After stirring at r.t. for 2 h, water was added and the precipitated product was collected by filtration, dried and was used in the next step without further purification (427 mg, 94%).
