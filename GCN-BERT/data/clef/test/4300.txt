Description of Related Art Current art is primarily based on epoxy resin technology cured with amino resins and phenolics. Coating compositions formed from bisphenol A based epoxy resins have been used to coat packaging and containers for foods and beverages. However, there is a desire among some consumers and brand owners for coating compositions free, or substantially free, of bisphenol A for packaging and containers for food and beverages U.S. Pat. No. 5,728,796 discloses a process which reacts an epoxide-containing compound with an aliphatic hydroxyl containing compound in the presence of a sulfonic acid catalyst. This process is used to form epoxy resins having high molecular weights. U.S. Pat. No. 4,012,559 discloses a radiation curable coating composition having an acrylic copolymer, a polyfunctional compound having a molecular weight not greater than 2,000, and an epoxidized vegetable oil. It is explained that the cured compositions can be coated onto metal to form precoated metal products Guo, et al., Rigid Polyurethane Foams Based on Soybean Oil, Journal of Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 77, 467-473 (2000) teaches the reaction of an epoxidized soybean oil with methanol to form an epoxidized soybean oil polyol that is used to prepare polyurethane foams for use in thermal insulation and packaging. U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0302694 discloses a radiation curable coating composition having an epoxidized vegetable oil oligomer prepared from the reaction of an epoxidized vegetable oil and a hydroxyl functional acrylate or hydroxyl functional methacrylate in the presence of a sulfonic acid catalyst. This composition can be used as a coating for packaging materials in food storage. U.S. Pat. No. 4,212,781 discloses processes for modifying an epoxy resin through a reaction with a copolymerizable monomer in the presence of an initiator. A graft polymer is formed from the epoxy resin by the grafting an addition polymer onto the aliphatic backbone of the epoxy resin. It is disclosed that the process is useful for making polymer blends for coating compositions. There is a desire to produce packaging coatings that do not contain bisphenol A or are substantially free of bisphenol A. The hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymers of the invention can be used in the preparation of coating compositions suitable, inter alia, as packaging coatings for food and beverage packaging and containers. They can be formulated to provide higher solids for application and improved corrosion resistance compared to some commercial epoxy coating systems. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The technology of the present invention has the capability of providing better corrosion resistance and higher solids coatings than some of the coatings of the current art. Higher solids allows broader coating latitude in a single pass operation. The present invention includes processes for producing a hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer. Such processes can be performed in a single reactor or in multiple reactors. In some embodiments of the invention, a hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer is prepared by a method comprising the steps of reacting an epoxidized vegetable oil with a hydroxyl functional material in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a hydroxyl functional oil polyol, and reacting the hydroxyl functional oil polyol with an ethylenically unsaturated monomer component in the presence of an initiator to form the hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer. The present invention also discloses coating compositions comprising a hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer prepared by a method comprising reacting an epoxidized vegetable oil with a hydroxyl functional material in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a hydroxyl functional oil polyol, reacting the hydroxyl functional oil polyol with an ethylenically unsaturated monomer component in the presence of an initiator to form a hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer, and crosslinking the hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer with a crosslinker to form the coating composition. In some embodiments, the present invention includes methods of coating a substrate by mixing the hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer with a crosslinker to form a mixture, applying the mixture to the substrate, and crosslinking the mixture. Substrates coated with the coating compositions are also disclosed. In some embodiments, the substrate is a can or packaging.

The present invention includes substrates coated at least in part with a coating composition of the invention and methods for coating the substrates. The term “substrate” as used herein includes, without limitation, cans, metal cans, packaging, containers, receptacles, or any portions thereof used to hold, touch or contact any type of food or beverage. Also, the terms “substrate”, “food can(s)”, “food containers” and the like include, for non-limiting example, “can ends”, which can be stamped from can end stock and used in the packaging of food and beverages. The present invention includes methods for preparing hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymers by reacting an epoxidized vegetable oil with a hydroxyl functional material in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a hydroxyl functional oil polyol, and reacting the hydroxyl functional oil polyol with an ethylenically unsaturated monomer component in the presence of an initiator to form the hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer. The hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymers can be used, inter alia, in the preparation of packaging coatings. In some embodiments of the invention, the hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymers are crosslinked with a crosslinker to form a coating composition for food and beverage packaging and containers. In some embodiments of the invention, hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymers are made into solvent and waterborne coatings compositions. Solvent borne coating compositions in some embodiments contain, for non-limiting example, an ethylenically unsaturated monomer component that includes without limitation non-functional ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as, for non-limiting example, butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, styrene, and the like, and optionally with lesser amounts of functional monomers such as, for non-limiting example, hydroxy propyl methacrylate, hydroxy ethyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and the like, as well as mixtures thereof. In some embodiments of the invention, hydroxyl functional monomers are added at a level of about 0 to about 30% by weight of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer component mixture, and acid functional monomers are added at a level of about 0 to about 30% by weight of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer component mixture. The water borne coating compositions in some embodiments of the invention contain non-functional and hydroxyl functional monomers as listed above, with higher levels of acid functional monomer to render the composition water dispersible. In some embodiments, about 10 to about 50% by weight of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer component mixture is an acid functional monomer. In some embodiments, the acid functional monomer is methacrylic acid. In that case, the hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer is inverted into water in some embodiments by adding a neutralizing base, such as without limitation, ammonia or a tertiary amine such as without limitation, dimethyl ethanol amine, and water. Final NV (non-volatile content by weight) is about 15 to about 40% by weight in some embodiments. The epoxidized vegetable oil can be used alone or in combination with other epoxidized vegetable oils. Epoxidized vegetable oils can be prepared from vegetable oils by, for non-limiting example, adding hydrogen peroxide and formic or acetic acid to the vegetable oil, and then holding the mixture at an elevated temperature until some or all of the carbon-carbon double bonds are converted to epoxide groups. Vegetable oils contain primarily glycerides which are triesters of glycerol and fatty acids with varying degrees of unsaturation. For non-limiting example, epoxidized vegetable oils for use in the invention can be made from vegetable oils (fatty acid triglycerides) such as without limitation, esters of glycerol and fatty acids having an alkyl chain of about 12 to about 24 carbon atoms. Fatty acid glycerides which are triglycerides in unsaturated glyceride oils are generally referred to as drying oils or semidrying oils. Drying oils include, for non-limiting example, linseed oil, perilla oil and combinations thereof, while semidrying oils include, without limitation, tall oil, soy bean oil, safflower oil and combinations thereof. Triglyceride oils in some embodiments have identical fatty acid chains or alternatively have different fatty acid chains attached to the same glycerol molecule. In some embodiments, the oils have fatty acid chains containing non-conjugated double bonds. In some embodiments, single double bond or conjugated double bond fatty acid chains are used in minor amounts. Double bond unsaturation in glycerides can be measured by iodine value (number) which indicates the degree of double bond unsaturation in the fatty acid chains. Unsaturated fatty acid glyceride oils employed in some embodiments of the invention have an iodine value greater than about 25 and alternatively between about 100 and about 210. Naturally occurring vegetable oils for use in the invention can be for non-limiting example, mixtures of fatty acid chains present as glycerides, and include without limitation a distribution of fatty acid esters of glyceride, where the fatty acid distribution may be random but within an established range that may vary moderately depending on the growing conditions of the vegetable source. Soy bean oil is employed in some embodiments which comprises approximately about 11% palmitic, about 4% stearic, about 25% oleic, about 51% linolenic, and about 9% linoleic fatty acids, where oleic, linoleic and linolenic are unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaturated vegetable oils employed in some embodiments of the invention, include without limitation, glyceride oils containing non-conjugated unsaturated fatty acid glyceride esters such as, without limitation, linoleic and linolenic fatty acids. Unsaturated glyceride oils include, without limitation, corn oil, cottonseed oil, grapeseed oil, hempseed oil, linseed oil, wild mustard oil, peanut oil, perilla oil, poppyseed oil, rapeseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, soy bean oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, tall oil, and mixtures thereof. Fatty acid glycerides for use in the invention include, for non-limiting example, those which contain linoleic and linolenic fatty acid chains, oils such as without limitation, hempseed oil, linseed oil, perilla oil, poppyseed oil, safflower oil, soy bean oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, tall oil, grapeseed oil, rattonseed oil, corn oil, and similar oils which contain high levels of linoleic and linolenic fatty acid glyceride. Glycerides can contain lesser amounts of saturated fatty acids in some embodiments. For non-limiting example, soy bean oil can be employed which contains predominantly linoleic and linolenic fatty acid glycerides. Combinations of such oils are employed in some embodiments of the invention. Vegetable oils can by fully or partially epoxidized by known processes, such as for non-limiting example, using acids such as, without limitation, peroxy acid for epoxidation of unsaturated double bonds of the unsaturated vegetable oil. Unsaturated glyceride oils employed in some embodiments include mono-, di-glycerides and mixtures thereof with tri-glycerides or fatty acid esters of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. In some embodiments, the epoxidized vegetable oil comprises corn oil, cottonseed oil, grapeseed oil, hempseed oil, linseed oil, wild mustard oil, peanut oil, perilla oil, poppyseed oil, rapeseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, soy bean oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, tall oil, a fatty acid ester, monoglyceride or diglyceride of such oils, or a mixture thereof.

In some embodiments, the hydroxyl functional material is present in an amount from about 1:99 to about 95:5 in a weight ratio of hydroxyl functional material to epoxidized vegetable oil, and alternatively from about 5:95 to about 40:60. In some embodiments, the equivalent ratio of hydroxyl functionality of the hydroxyl functional material to oxirane functionality in the epoxidized vegetable oil is from about 0.1:1 to about 3:1. In some embodiments, the equivalent ratio of hydroxyl functionality to oxirane functionality in the epoxidized vegetable oil is from about 0.2:1 to about 3:1. In some embodiments, the equivalent ratio of hydroxyl functionality to oxirane functionality in the epoxidized vegetable oil is about 0.2:1. The acid catalyst employed to facilitate the reaction of the epoxidized vegetable oil with the hydroxyl functional material can be a strong acid catalyst in some embodiments of the invention such as, for non-limiting example, one or more sulfonic acids or another strong acid (an acid with a pKa about 3 or less), a triflic acid, a triflate salt of a metal of Group IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB or VIIIA of the Periodic Table of Elements (according to the IUPAC 1970 convention), a mixture of said triflate salts, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the amount of the acid catalyst can range from about 1 ppm to about 10,000 ppm, and alternatively from about 10 ppm to about 1,000 ppm, based on the total weight of the reaction mixture.

The amount of the metal triflate catalyst can range, for non-limiting example, from about 10 to about 1,000 ppm, alternatively from about 10 to about 200 ppm, based on the total weight of the reaction mixture. Some embodiments of the invention employ a metal triflate catalyst in the form of a solution in an organic solvent.

In some embodiments, the epoxidized vegetable oil and hydroxyl functional material are heated in the presence of an acid catalyst to a temperature of about 50 to about 200° C. Optionally, a solvent can be included in the synthesis of the epoxidized vegetable oil and hydroxyl functional material to help control viscosity. In some embodiments, the solvent includes, for non-limiting example, a ketone such as, without limitation, methyl amyl ketone, an aromatic solvent such as, without limitation, xylene or Aromatic 100, an ester solvent or other non-hydroxyl functional solvent, and mixtures thereof. About 0 to about 90% of a solvent based on the total weight reaction mixture is employed in various embodiments of the invention, and alternatively about 5 to about 30% is employed. After about 2 to about 3 hours, >90% of the epoxide groups are consumed in some embodiments. Solvents selected from those described above as well as other solvents including, without limitation, hydroxyl functional solvents can be added upon cooling. In some embodiments, it is desirable to have a final NV (non-volatile content by weight) of about 30 to about 80. In some embodiments, an ethylenically unsaturated monomer component and an initiator are reacted with the hydroxyl functional oil polyol to form a hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer. The ethylenically unsaturated monomer component and the initiator can be added after the hydroxyl functional oil polyol is cooled. In some embodiments, the ethylenically unsaturated monomer component and initiator are added over about 2 hours. In some embodiments, the reaction product of the hydroxyl functional oil polyol, ethylenically unsaturated monomer component and initiator is cooled after about a 1 hour hold to form the hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer. Although the term “acrylic” is used in describing the hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer, the word acrylic is used in its broadest sense to include all ethylenically unsaturated monomer components. The ethylenically unsaturated monomer component can be composed of a single monomer or a mixture of monomers. The ethylenically unsaturated monomer component includes, without limitation, one or more or a mixture of vinyl monomers, acrylic monomers, allylic monomers, acrylamide monomers, vinyl esters including without limitation, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrates, vinyl benzoates, vinyl isopropyl acetates, and similar vinyl esters, vinyl halides including without limitation, vinyl chloride, vinyl fluoride and vinylidene chloride, vinyl aromatic hydrocarbons including without limitation, styrene, methyl styrenes and similar lower alkyl styrenes, chlorostyrene, vinyl toluene, vinyl naphthalene, vinyl aliphatic hydrocarbon monomers including without limitation, alpha olefins such as for non-limiting example, ethylene, propylene, isobutylene, and cyclohexene, as well as conjugated dienes such as for non-limiting example, 1,3-butadiene, methyl-2-butadiene, 1,3-piperylene, 2,3 dimethyl butadiene, isoprene, cyclohexane, cyclopentadiene, and dicyclopentadiene. Vinyl alkyl ethers include without limitation, methyl vinyl ether, isopropyl vinyl ether, n-butyl vinyl ether, and isobutyl vinyl ether. Acrylic monomers include without limitation, monomers such as for non-limiting example, lower alkyl esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid having an alkyl ester portion containing between about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms, as well as aromatic derivatives of acrylic and methacrylic acid.

In some embodiments, the weight ratio of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer component to the hydroxyl functional oil polyol is from about 1:99 to about 99:1, alternatively from about 5:95 to about 95:5, and alternatively from about 30:70 to about 70:30. Various initiators are employed alone or in combination in some embodiments of the invention. In some embodiments, initiators with high grafting efficiencies are employed. The initiator includes without limitation, azo compounds such as for non-limiting example, 2,2′-azo-bis(isobutyronitrile), 2,2′-azo-bis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile), and 1-t-butyl-azocyanocyclohexane), hydroperoxides such as for non-limiting example, t-butyl hydroperoxide and cumene hydroperoxide, peroxides such as for non-limiting example, benzoyl peroxide, caprylyl peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, ethyl 3,3′-di(t-butylperoxy) butyrate, ethyl 3,3′-di(t-amylperoxy) butyrate, t-amylperoxy-2-ethyl hexanoate, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl-peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate, and t-butylperoxy pivilate, peresters such as for non-limiting example, t-butyl peracetate, t-butyl perphthalate, and t-butyl perbenzoate, as well as percarbonates, such as for non-limiting example, di(1-cyano-1-methylethyl)peroxy dicarbonate, perphosphates, t-butyl peroctoate, and the like and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the initiator is present in an amount from about 0.1 to about 15%, and alternatively from about 1 to about 5%, based on the weight of the monomer mixture. The temperature chosen for grafting the ethylenically unsaturated monomer component may vary with the half life of the selected initiator in some embodiments on the invention. For non-limiting example, at 130° C. t-butyl peroxy benzoate has a half life of about 30 minutes and can be employed for grafting. Dibenzoyl peroxide has a 30 minute half life at 100° C., and 100° C. could be a temperature to graft the hydroxyl functional oil polyol with dibenzoyl peroxide in some embodiments of the invention. Broadly, depending on the half life of the initiator used, the reaction can be carried out from about 50 to about 200° C. In some embodiments, one or more mixtures of an initiator with or without a solvent is added after formation of the hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer to reduce the free monomer content. The compositions of the initiator and solvent in these one or more mixtures can be the same as or different than the compositions of these components used to form the hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer. In some embodiments, the acrylic grafted hydroxyl functional oil polyol is mixed with a crosslinker to form a curable coating composition. A non-limiting list of crosslinkers for use in the invention includes benzoguanamine, benzoguanamine formaldehyde, glycoluril, melamine formaldehyde, a phenolic crosslinker, phenol formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde, an isocyanate, a blocked isocyanate, and mixtures thereof. In various embodiments, the crosslinker to hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymer ratio is about 1:99 to about 90:10, and alternatively about 5:95 to about 60:40. Optionally, the mixture of the acrylic grafted hydroxyl functional oil polyol and crosslinker can occur in the presence of a cure catalyst. Cure catalysts include, for non-limiting example, dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid, p-toluene sulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, and the like and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, other polymers that may blended into the coating composition, such as without limitation, polyethers, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyurethanes and the like, as well as mixtures thereof. Cure conditions for packaging coatings in some embodiments are about 10 to about 60 seconds at about 500° F. to about 600° F., and alternatively about 1 minute to about 20 minutes at about 250° F. to about 500° F. The hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymers and the coating compositions of the invention can include conventional additives known to those skilled in the art, such as without limitation, flow agents, surface active agents, defoamers, anti-cratering additives, lubricants, meat-release additives, and cure catalysts. The hydroxyl functional oil polyol acrylic graft copolymers can be crosslinked with a crosslinker to form coating compositions. In some embodiments of the invention, one or more coating compositions are applied to a substrate, such as for non-limiting example, cans, metal cans, packaging, containers, receptacles, can ends, or any portions thereof used to hold or touch any type of food or beverage. In some embodiments, one or more coatings are applied in addition to the coating compositions of the present invention, such as for non-limiting example, a prime coat may be applied between the substrate and the coating composition. The coating compositions can be applied to substrates in any manner known to those skilled in the art. In some embodiments, the coating compositions are sprayed or roll coated onto a substrate. When applied, the coating compositions contain, for non-limiting example, between about 10% and about 30% by weight polymeric solids relative to about 70% to about 90% water, including other volatiles such as, without limitation, minimal amounts of solvents, if desired. For some applications, typically those other than spraying, solvent borne polymeric solutions can contain, for non-limiting example, between about 20% and about 60% by weight polymer solids. Organic solvents are utilized in some embodiments to facilitate roll coating or other application methods and such solvents can include, without limitation, n-butanol, 2-butoxy-ethanol-1, xylene and other aromatic solvents and ester solvents, and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, n-butanol is used in combination with 2-butoxy-ethanol-1. The coating compositions of the present invention can be pigmented and/or opacified with known pigments and opacifiers in some embodiments. For many uses, including food use for non-limiting example, the pigment can be zinc oxide, carbon black, or titanium dioxide. The resulting coating compositions are applied in some embodiments by conventional methods known in the coating industry. Thus, for non-limiting example, spraying, rolling, dipping, and flow coating application methods can be used for both clear and pigmented films. In some embodiments, after application onto a substrate, the coating composition is thermally cured at temperatures in the range of about 130° C. to about 250° C., and alternatively higher for time sufficient to effect complete curing as well as volatilizing any fugitive components. For substrates intended as beverage containers, the coating are applied in some embodiments at a rate in the range from about 0.5 to about 15 milligrams of polymer coating per square inch of exposed substrate surface. In some embodiments, the water-dispersible coating is applied at a thickness between about 0.1 and about 1 mil.
