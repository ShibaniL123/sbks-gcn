FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to compounds useful as kinase inhibitors, including the modulation of IRAK-4. Provided herein are monocyclic heteroaryl-substituted pyridyl compounds, compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of their use. The invention further pertains to pharmaceutical compositions containing at least one compound according to the invention that are useful for the treatment of conditions related to kinase modulation and methods of inhibiting the activity of kinases, including IRAK-4 in a mammal. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Toll/IL-1 receptor family members are important regulators of inflammation and host resistance. The Toll like receptor (TLR) family recognizes molecular patterns derived from infectious organisms including bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses (reviewed in Kawai, T. et al., Nature Immunol., 11:373-384 (2010)). Ligand binding to the receptor induces dimerization and recruitment of adaptor molecules to a conserved cytoplasmic motif in the receptor termed the Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain. With the exception of TLR3, all TLRs recruit the adaptor molecule MyD88. The IL-1 receptor family also contains a cytoplasmic TIR motif and recruits MyD88 upon ligand binding (reviewed in Sims, J. E. et al., Nature Rev. Immunol., 10:89-102 (2010)). Members of the IRAK family of serine/threonine kinases are recruited to the receptor via interactions with MyD88. The family consists of four members. Several lines of evidence indicate that IRAK4 plays a critical and non-redundant role in initiating signaling via MyD88 dependent TLRs and IL-1R family members. Structural data confirms that IRAK4 directly interacts with MyD88 and subsequently recruits either IRAK1 or IRAK2 to the receptor complex to facilitate downstream signaling (Lin, S. et al., Nature, 465:885-890 (2010)). IRAK4 directly phosphorylates IRAK1 to facilitate downstream signaling to the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, resulting in activation of the serine/threonine kinase TAK1 with subsequent activation of the NFκB pathway and MAPK cascade (Flannery, S. et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 80:1981-1991 (2010)). A subset of human patients was identified who lack IRAK4 expression (Picard, C. et al., Science, 299:2076-2079 (2003)). Cells from these patients fail to respond to all TLR agonists with the exception of TLR3 as well as to members of the IL-1 family including IL-1β and IL-18 (Ku, C. et al., J. Exp. Med., 204:2407-2422 (2007)). Deletion of IRAK4 in mice results in a severe block in IL-1, IL-18 and all TLR dependent responses with the exception of TLR3 (Suzuki, N. et al., Nature, 416:750-754 (2002)). In contrast, deletion of either IRAK1 (Thomas, J. A. et al., J. Immunol., 163:978-984 (1999); Swantek, J. L. et al., J. Immunol., 164:4301-4306 (2000) or IRAK2 (Wan, Y. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 284:10367-10375 (2009)) results in partial loss of signaling. Furthermore, IRAK4 is the only member of the IRAK family whose kinase activity has been shown to be required for initiation of signaling. Replacement of wild type IRAK4 in the mouse genome with a kinase inactive mutant (KDKI) impairs signaling via all MyD88 dependent receptors including IL-1, IL-18 and all TLRs with the exception of TLR3 (Koziczak-Holbro, M. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 282:13552-13560 (2007); Kawagoe, T. et al., J. Exp. Med., 204:1013-1024 (2007); and Fraczek, J. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 283:31697-31705 (2008)). As compared to wild type animals, IRAK4 KDKI mice show greatly reduced disease severity in mouse models of multiple sclerosis (Staschke, K. A. et al., J. Immunol., 183:568-577 (2009)), rheumatoid arthritis (Koziczak-Holbro, M. et al., Arthritis Rheum., 60:1661-1671 (2009)), atherosclerosis (Kim, T. W. et al., J. Immunol., 186:2871-2880 (2011) and Rekhter, M. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 367:642-648 (2008)), and myocardial infarction (Maekawa, Y. et al., Circulation, 120:1401-1414 (2009)). As described, IRAK4 inhibitors will block all MyD88 dependent signaling. MyD88 dependent TLRs have been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, sepsis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel diseases including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, autoimmune uveitis, psoriasis, asthma, allergy, type I diabetes, and allograft rejection (Keogh, B. et al., Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 32:435-442 (2011); Mann, D. L., Circ. Res., 108:1133-1145 (2011); Jiang, W. et al., J. Invest. Dermatol. (2013) doi: 10.1038/jid.2013.57; Horton, C. G. et al., Mediators Inflamm., Article ID 498980 (2010), doi:10.1155/2010/498980; Goldstein, D. R. et al., J. Heart Lung Transplant., 24:1721-1729 (2005); and Cario, E., Inflamm. Bowel Dis., 16:1583-1597 (2010)). Oncogenically active MyD88 mutations in diffuse large B cell lymphomas have been identified that are sensitive to IRAK4 inhibition (Ngo, V. N. et al., Nature, 470:115-121 (2011)). Whole genome sequencing also identified mutations in MyD88 associated with chronic lymphatic leukemia and Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia suggesting that IRAK4 inhibitors may also have utility in treating leukemias (Puente, X. S. et al., Nature, 475:101-105 (2011); Treon, S. P. et. al., New Engl. J. Med., 367:826-833 (2012)). In addition to blocking TLR signaling, IRAK4 inhibitors will also block signaling by members of the IL-1 family. Neutralization of IL-1 has been shown to be efficacious in multiple diseases including gout; gouty arthritis; type 2 diabetes; auto-inflammatory diseases including Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS), TNF Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), adult onset stills; systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis; stroke; GVHD; smoldering multiple myeloma; recurrent pericarditis; osteoarthritis; emphysema (Dinarello, C. A., Eur. J. Immunol., 41:1203-1217 (2011) and Couillin, I. et al., J. Immunol., 183:8195-8202 (2009)). In a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, blockade of IL-1 receptor improved cognitive defects, attenuated tau pathology and reduced oligomeric forms of amyloid-β (Kitazawa, M. et al., J. Immunol., 187:6539-6549 (2011)). IL-1 has also been shown to be a critical link to adaptive immunity, driving differentiation of the TH17 effector T cell subset (Chung, Y. et al., Immunity, 30:576-587 (2009)). Therefore, IRAK4 inhibitors are predicted to have efficacy in TH17 associated diseases including multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases, autoimmune uveitis, and rheumatoid arthritis (Wilke, C. M. et al., Trends Immunol., 32:603-661 (2011)). In view of the conditions that may benefit by treatment involving modulation of protein kinases, it is immediately apparent that new compounds capable of modulating protein kinases such as IRAK-4 and methods of using these compounds could provide substantial therapeutic benefits to a wide variety of patients.

The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential attributes thereof. This invention encompasses all combinations of preferred aspects and/or embodiments of the invention noted herein. It is understood that any and all embodiments of the present invention may be taken in conjunction with any other embodiment or embodiments to describe additional more preferred embodiments. It is also to be understood that each individual element of the preferred embodiments is its own independent preferred embodiment. Furthermore, any element of an embodiment is meant to be combined with any and all other elements from any embodiment to describe an additional embodiment. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following are definitions of terms used in this specification and appended claims. The initial definition provided for a group or term herein applies to that group or term throughout the specification and claims, individually or as part of another group, unless otherwise indicated. Compounds of this invention may have one or more asymmetric centers. Unless otherwise indicated, all chiral (enantiomeric and diastereomeric) and racemic forms of compounds of the present invention are included in the present invention. Many geometric isomers of olefins, C═N double bonds, and the like can also be present in the compounds, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis- and trans-geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. The present compounds can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. It is well known in the art how to prepare optically active forms, such as by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials. All chiral, (enantiomeric and diastereomeric) and racemic forms and all geometric isomeric forms of a structure are intended, unless the specific stereochemistry or isomer form is specifically indicated. When any variable (e.g., R3) occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-2 R3, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to two R3 groups and R3 at each occurrence is selected independently from the definition of R3. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom via which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. In cases wherein there are nitrogen atoms (e.g., amines) on compounds of the present invention, these can be converted to N-oxides by treatment with an oxidizing agent (e.g., MCPBA and/or hydrogen peroxides) to afford other compounds of this invention. Thus, all shown and claimed nitrogen atoms are considered to cover both the shown nitrogen and its N-oxide (N→O) derivative. In accordance with a convention used in the art, is used in structural formulas herein to depict the bond that is the point of attachment of the moiety or substituent to the core or backbone structure. A dash “-” that is not between two letters or symbols is used to indicate a point of attachment for a substituent. For example, —CONH2 is attached through the carbon atom. The term “optionally substituted” in reference to a particular moiety of the compound of Formula I (e.g., an optionally substituted heteroaryl group) refers to a moiety having 0, 1, 2, or more substituents. For example, “optionally substituted alkyl” encompasses both “alkyl” and “substituted alkyl” as defined below. It will be understood by those skilled in the art, with respect to any group containing one or more substituents, that such groups are not intended to introduce any substitution or substitution patterns that are sterically impractical, synthetically non-feasible and/or inherently unstable. As used herein, the term “at least one chemical entity” is interchangeable with the term “a compound”. As used herein, the term “alkyl” or “alkylene” is intended to include both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, “C1-10 alkyl” (or alkylene), is intended to include C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, and C10 alkyl groups. Additionally, for example, “C1-C6 alkyl” denotes alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Alkyl groups can be unsubstituted or substituted so that one or more of its hydrogens are replaced by another chemical group. Example alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, methyl (Me), ethyl (Et), propyl (e.g., n-propyl and isopropyl), butyl (e.g., n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl), pentyl (e.g., n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl), and the like. Alkenyl” or “alkenylene” is intended to include hydrocarbon chains of either straight or branched configuration and having one or more double carbon-carbon bonds that may occur in any stable point along the chain. For example, “C2-6 alkenyl” (or alkenylene), is intended to include C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 alkenyl groups. Examples of alkenyl include, but are not limited to, ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, 2-butenyl, 3-butenyl, 2-pentenyl, 3-pentenyl, 4-pentenyl, 2-hexenyl, 3-hexenyl, 4-hexenyl, 5-hexenyl, 2-methyl-2-propenyl, 4-methyl-3-pentenyl, and the like. “Alkynyl” or “alkynylene” is intended to include hydrocarbon chains of either straight or branched configuration and having one or more triple carbon-carbon bonds that may occur in any stable point along the chain. For example, “C2-6 alkynyl” (or alkynylene), is intended to include C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 alkynyl groups; such as ethynyl, propynyl, butynyl, pentynyl, hexynyl and the like. One skilled in the field will understand that, when the designation “CO2” is used herein, this is intended to refer to the group When the term “alkyl” is used together with another group, such as in “arylalkyl”, this conjunction defines with more specificity at least one of the substituents that the substituted alkyl will contain. For example, “arylalkyl” refers to a substituted alkyl group as defined above where at least one of the substituents is an aryl, such as benzyl. Thus, the term aryl(C0-4)alkyl includes a substituted lower alkyl having at least one aryl substituent and also includes an aryl directly bonded to another group, i.e., aryl(C0)alkyl. The term “heteroarylalkyl” refers to a substituted alkyl group as defined above where at least one of the substituents is a heteroaryl. When reference is made to a substituted alkenyl, alkynyl, alkylene, alkenylene, or alkynylene group, these groups are substituted with one to three substituents as defined above for substituted alkyl groups. The term “alkoxy” refers to an oxygen atom substituted by alkyl or substituted alkyl, as defined herein. For example, the term “alkoxy” includes the group —O—C1-6 alkyl such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, sec-butoxy, tert-butoxy, pentoxy, 2-pentyloxy, isopentoxy, neopentoxy, hexoxy, 2-hexoxy, 3-hexoxy, 3-methylpentoxy, and the like. “Lower alkoxy” refers to alkoxy groups having one to four carbons. It should be understood that the selections for all groups, including for example, alkoxy, thioalkyl, and aminoalkyl, will be made by one skilled in the field to provide stable compounds. The term “substituted”, as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the designated atom or group is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valence is not exceeded. When a substituent is oxo, or keto, (i.e., ═O) then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Keto substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. Unless otherwise specified, substituents are named into the core structure. For example, it is to be understood that when (cycloalkyl)alkyl is listed as a possible substituent, the point of attachment of this substituent to the core structure is in the alkyl portion. Ring double bonds, as used herein, are double bonds that are formed between two adjacent ring atoms (e.g., C═C, C═N, or N═N). Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds or useful synthetic intermediates. A stable compound or stable structure is meant to imply a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation from a reaction mixture to a useful degree of purity, and subsequent formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. It is preferred that the presently recited compounds do not contain a N-halo, S(O)2H, or S(O)H group. The term “cycloalkyl” refers to cyclized alkyl groups, including mono-, bi- or poly-cyclic ring systems. C3-7 cycloalkyl is intended to include C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7 cycloalkyl groups. Example cycloalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, norbornyl, and the like. As used herein, “carbocycle” or “carbocyclic residue” is intended to mean any stable 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-monocyclic or bicyclic or 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 11-, 12-, or 13-membered bicyclic or tricyclic ring, any of which may be saturated, partially unsaturated, unsaturated or aromatic. Examples of such carbocycles include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclobutenyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptenyl, cycloheptyl, cycloheptenyl, adamantyl, cyclooctyl, cyclooctenyl, cyclooctadienyl, [3.3.0]bicyclooctane, [4.3.0]bicyclononane, [4.4.0]bicyclodecane, [2.2.2]bicyclooctane, fluorenyl, phenyl, naphthyl, indanyl, adamantyl, anthracenyl, and tetrahydronaphthyl (tetralin). As shown above, bridged rings are also included in the definition of carbocycle (e.g., [2.2.2]bicyclooctane). Preferred carbocycles, unless otherwise specified, are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and phenyl. When the term “carbocycle” is used, it is intended to include “aryl”. A bridged ring occurs when one or more carbon atoms link two non-adjacent carbon atoms. Preferred bridges are one or two carbon atoms. It is noted that a bridge always converts a monocyclic ring into a bicyclic ring. When a ring is bridged, the substituents recited for the ring may also be present on the bridge. The term “aryl” refers to monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon groups having 6 to 12 carbon atoms in the ring portion, such as phenyl, and naphthyl groups, each of which may be substituted. Accordingly, in compounds of Formula (I), the term “cycloalkyl” includes cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, bicyclooctyl, etc., as well as the following ring systems: and the like, which optionally may be substituted at any available atoms of the ring(s). Preferred cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and The term “halo” or “halogen” refers to chloro, bromo, fluoro and iodo. The term “haloalkyl” means a substituted alkyl having one or more halo substituents. For example, “haloalkyl” includes mono, bi, and trifluoromethyl. The term “haloalkoxy” means an alkoxy group having one or more halo substituents. For example, “haloalkoxy” includes OCF3. Thus, examples of aryl groups include: (fluorenyl) and the like, which optionally may be substituted at any available carbon or nitrogen atom. A preferred aryl group is optionally-substituted phenyl. The terms “heterocycloalkyl”, “heterocyclo”, “heterocyclic”, or “heterocyclyl” may be used interchangeably and refer to substituted and unsubstituted 3- to 7-membered monocyclic groups, 7- to 11-membered bicyclic groups, and 10- to 15-membered tricyclic groups, in which at least one of the rings has at least one heteroatom (O, S or N), said heteroatom containing ring preferably having 1, 2, or 3 heteroatoms selected from O, S, and N. Each ring of such a group containing a heteroatom can contain one or two oxygen or sulfur atoms and/or from one to four nitrogen atoms provided that the total number of heteroatoms in each ring is four or less, and further provided that the ring contains at least one carbon atom. The nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen atoms may optionally be quaternized. The fused rings completing the bicyclic and tricyclic groups may contain only carbon atoms and may be saturated, partially saturated, or unsaturated. The heterocyclo group may be attached at any available nitrogen or carbon atom. The term “heterocycle” includes “heteroaryl” groups. As valence allows, if said further ring is cycloalkyl or heterocyclo it is additionally optionally substituted with ═O (oxo). Exemplary monocyclic heterocyclyl groups include azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, oxetanyl, imidazolinyl, oxazolidinyl, isoxazolinyl, thiazolidinyl, isothiazolidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, piperidyl, piperazinyl, 2-oxopiperazinyl, 2-oxopiperidyl, 2-oxopyrrolodinyl, 2-oxoazepinyl, azepinyl, 1-pyridonyl, 4-piperidonyl, tetrahydropyranyl, morpholinyl, thiamorpholinyl, thiamorpholinyl sulfoxide, thiamorpholinyl sulfone, 1,3-dioxolane and tetrahydro-1,1-dioxothienyl and the like.

Additional monocyclic heterocyclyl groups include The term “heteroaryl” refers to substituted and unsubstituted aromatic 5- or 6-membered monocyclic groups, 9- or 10-membered bicyclic groups, and 11- to 14-membered tricyclic groups which have at least one heteroatom (O, S or N) in at least one of the rings, said heteroatom-containing ring preferably having 1, 2, or 3 heteroatoms selected from O, S, and N. Each ring of the heteroaryl group containing a heteroatom can contain one or two oxygen or sulfur atoms and/or from one to four nitrogen atoms provided that the total number of heteroatoms in each ring is four or less and each ring has at least one carbon atom. The fused rings completing the bicyclic and tricyclic groups may contain only carbon atoms and may be saturated, partially saturated, or unsaturated. The nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen atoms may optionally be quaternized. Heteroaryl groups which are bicyclic or tricyclic must include at least one fully aromatic ring but the other fused ring or rings may be aromatic or non-aromatic. The heteroaryl group may be attached at any available nitrogen or carbon atom of any ring.

Unless otherwise indicated, when reference is made to a specifically-named aryl (e.g., phenyl), cycloalkyl (e.g., cyclohexyl), heterocyclo (e.g., pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, and morpholinyl) or heteroaryl (e.g., tetrazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, triazolyl, thiazolyl, and furyl) the reference is intended to include rings having 0 to 3, preferably 0 to 2, substituents selected from those recited above for the aryl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclo and/or heteroaryl groups, as appropriate. The term “carbocyclyl” or “carbocyclic” refers to a saturated or unsaturated monocyclic or bicyclic ring in which all atoms of all rings are carbon. Thus, the term includes cycloalkyl and aryl rings. Monocyclic carbocycles have 3 to 6 ring atoms, still more typically 5 or 6 ring atoms. Bicyclic carbocycles have 7 to 12 ring atoms, e.g., arranged as a bicyclo[4,5], [5,5], [5,6] or [6,6] system, or 9 or 10 ring atoms arranged as a bicyclo[5,6] or [6,6] system. Examples of mono- and bicyclic carbocycles include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, 1-cyclopent-1-enyl, 1-cyclopent-2-enyl, 1-cyclopent-3-enyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohex-1-enyl, 1-cyclohex-2-enyl, 1-cyclohex-3-enyl, phenyl and naphthyl.

The term “heteroatoms” shall include oxygen, sulfur and nitrogen. When the term “unsaturated” is used herein to refer to a ring or group, the ring or group may be fully unsaturated or partially unsaturated. Throughout the specification, groups and substituents thereof may be chosen by one skilled in the field to provide stable moieties and compounds and compounds useful as pharmaceutically-acceptable compounds and/or intermediate compounds useful in making pharmaceutically-acceptable compounds. The compounds of Formula (I) may exist in a free form (with no ionization) or can form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Unless otherwise indicated, reference to an inventive compound is understood to include reference to the free form and to salts thereof. The term “salt(s)” denotes acidic and/or basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids and bases. In addition, the term “salt(s) may include zwitterions (inner salts), e.g., when a compound of Formula (I), contains both a basic moiety, such as an amine or a pyridine or imidazole ring, and an acidic moiety, such as a carboxylic acid. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred, such as, for example, acceptable metal and amine salts in which the cation does not contribute significantly to the toxicity or biological activity of the salt. However, other salts may be useful, e.g., in isolation or purification steps which may be employed during preparation, and thus, are contemplated within the scope of the invention. Salts of the compounds of the Formula (I) may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of the Formula (I) with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization. Exemplary acid addition salts include acetates (such as those formed with acetic acid or trihaloacetic acid, for example, trifluoroacetic acid), adipates, alginates, ascorbates, aspartates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, cyclopentanepropionates, digluconates, dodecylsulfates, ethanesulfonates, fumarates, glucoheptanoates, glycerophosphates, hemisulfates, heptanoates, hexanoates, hydrochlorides (formed with hydrochloric acid), hydrobromides (formed with hydrogen bromide), hydroiodides, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonates, lactates, maleates (formed with maleic acid), methanesulfonates (formed with methanesulfonic acid), 2-naphthalenesulfonates, nicotinates, nitrates, oxalates, pectinates, persulfates, 3-phenylpropionates, phosphates, picrates, pivalates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates (such as those formed with sulfuric acid), sulfonates (such as those mentioned herein), tartrates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates such as tosylates, undecanoates, and the like. Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts; barium, zinc, and aluminum salts; salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as trialkylamines such as triethylamine, procaine, dibenzylamine, N-benzyl-β-phenethylamine, 1-ephenamine, N,N′-dibenzylethylene-diamine, dehydroabietylamine, N-ethylpiperidine, benzylamine, dicyclohexylamine or similar pharmaceutically acceptable amines and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g., dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g., decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g., benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others. Preferred salts include monohydrochloride, hydrogensulfate, methanesulfonate, phosphate or nitrate salts. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic groups such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic, and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1990), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. All stereoisomers of the compounds of the instant invention are contemplated, either in admixture or in pure or substantially pure form. Stereoisomers may include compounds which are optical isomers through possession of one or more chiral atoms, as well as compounds which are optical isomers by virtue of limited rotation about one or more bonds (atropisomers). The definition of compounds according to the invention embraces all the possible stereoisomers and their mixtures. It very particularly embraces the racemic forms and the isolated optical isomers having the specified activity. The racemic forms can be resolved by physical methods, such as, for example, fractional crystallization, separation or crystallization of diastereomeric derivatives or separation by chiral column chromatography. The individual optical isomers can be obtained from the racemates from the conventional methods, such as, for example, salt formation with an optically active acid followed by crystallization. The present invention is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include deuterium and tritium. Isotopes of carbon include 13C and 14C. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed. Prodrugs and solvates of the inventive compounds are also contemplated. The term “prodrug” denotes a compound which, upon administration to a subject, undergoes chemical conversion by metabolic or chemical processes to yield a compound of the Formula (I), and/or a salt and/or solvate thereof. Any compound that will be converted in vivo to provide the bioactive agent (i.e., the compound for Formula (I)) is a prodrug within the scope and spirit of the invention. For example, compounds containing a carboxy group can form physiologically hydrolyzable esters which serve as prodrugs by being hydrolyzed in the body to yield Formula (I) compounds per se. Such prodrugs are preferably administered orally since hydrolysis in many instances occurs principally under the influence of the digestive enzymes. Parenteral administration may be used where the ester per se is active, or in those instances where hydrolysis occurs in the blood. Examples of physiologically hydrolyzable esters of compounds of Formula (I) include C1-6 alkylbenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, indanyl, phthalyl, methoxymethyl, C1-6 alkanoyloxy-C1-6 alkyl, e.g., acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl or propionyloxymethyl, C1-6 alkoxycarbonyloxy-C1-6 alkyl, e.g., methoxycarbonyl-oxymethyl or ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, glycyloxymethyl, phenylglycyloxymethyl, (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)-methyl and other well known physiologically hydrolyzable esters used, for example, in the penicillin and cephalosporin arts. Such esters may be prepared by conventional techniques known in the art. Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art. For examples of such prodrug derivatives, see: a) Bundgaard, H., ed., Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier (1985), and Widder, K. et al., eds., Methods in Enzymology, 112:309-396, Academic Press (1985);b) Bundgaard, H., Chapter 5, “Design and Application of Prodrugs”, Krosgaard-Larsen, P. et al., eds., A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, pp. 113-191, Harwood Academic Publishers (1991); andc) Bundgaard, H., Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev., 8:1-38 (1992), each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Compounds of the Formula (I) and salts thereof may exist in their tautomeric form, in which hydrogen atoms are transposed to other parts of the molecules and the chemical bonds between the atoms of the molecules are consequently rearranged. It should be understood that the all tautomeric forms, insofar as they may exist, are included within the invention. Additionally, inventive compounds may have trans and cis isomers. It should further be understood that solvates (e.g., hydrates) of the compounds of Formula (I) are also with the scope of the present invention. Methods of solvation are generally known in the art.

Other types of kinase activity that may be modulated by the compounds of the instant invention include, but are not limited to, the Pelle/IRAK family and mutants thereof. Accordingly, compounds of Formula (I) have utility in treating conditions associated with the modulation of kinase activity, and particularly the selective inhibition of IRAK-4 activity or the inhibition of IRAK and other Pelle family kinases. Such conditions include TLR/IL-1 family receptor associated diseases in which cytokine levels are modulated as a consequence of intracellular signaling. Moreover, the compounds of Formula (I) have advantageous selectivity for IRAK-4 activity, preferably from at least 20 fold to over 1,000 fold more selective.

Alternatively preferred methods of treatment are those wherein the condition is selected from ischemia reperfusion injury, including cerebral ischemia reperfusions injury arising from stroke and cardiac ischemia reperfusion injury arising from myocardial infarction. Another preferred method of treatment is one in which the condition is multiple myeloma. In addition, the kinase inhibitors of the present invention inhibit the expression of inducible pro-inflammatory proteins such as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2 (PGHS-2), also referred to as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, chemokines Accordingly, additional IRAK-4-associated conditions include edema, analgesia, fever and pain, such as neuromuscular pain, headache, pain caused by cancer, dental pain and arthritis pain. The inventive compounds also may be used to treat veterinary viral infections, such as lentivirus infections, including, but not limited to equine infectious anemia virus; or retrovirus infections, including feline immunodeficiency virus, bovine immunodeficiency virus, and canine immunodeficiency virus. When the terms “IRAK-4-associated condition” or “IRAK-4-associated disease or disorder” are used herein, each is intended to encompass all of the conditions identified above as if repeated at length, as well as any other condition that is affected by IRAK-4 kinase activity. The present invention thus provides methods for treating such conditions, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically-effective amount of at least one compound of Formula (I) or a salt thereof “Therapeutically effective amount” is intended to include an amount of a compound of the present invention that is effective when administered alone or in combination to inhibit IRAK-4 and/or treat diseases. The methods of treating IRAK-4 kinase-associated conditions may comprise administering compounds of Formula (I) alone or in combination with each other and/or other suitable therapeutic agents useful in treating such conditions. Accordingly, “therapeutically effective amount” is also intended to include an amount of the combination of compounds claimed that is effective to inhibit IRAK-4 and/or treat diseases associated with IRAK-4. Exemplary of such other therapeutic agents include corticosteroids, rolipram, calphostin, cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs (CSAIDs), Interleukin-10, glucocorticoids, salicylates, nitric oxide, and other immunosuppressants; nuclear translocation inhibitors, such as deoxyspergualin (DSG); non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, celecoxib and rofecoxib; steroids such as prednisone or dexamethasone; antiviral agents such as abacavir; antiproliferative agents such as methotrexate, leflunomide, FK506 (tacrolimus, PROGRAF®); anti-malarials such as hydroxychloroquine; cytotoxic drugs such as azathiprine and cyclophosphamide; TNF-α inhibitors such as tenidap, anti-TNF antibodies or soluble TNF receptor, and rapamycin (sirolimus or RAPAMUNE®) or derivatives thereof.

The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions capable of treating IRAK-4 kinase-associated conditions, including TLR and IL-1 family receptor mediated diseases as described above. The inventive compositions may contain other therapeutic agents as described above and may be formulated, for example, by employing conventional solid or liquid vehicles or diluents, as well as pharmaceutical additives of a type appropriate to the mode of desired administration (e.g., excipients, binders, preservatives, stabilizers, flavors, etc.) according to techniques such as those well known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation. Accordingly, the present invention further includes compositions comprising one or more compounds of Formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to media generally accepted in the art for the delivery of biologically active agents to animals, in particular, mammals. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are formulated according to a number of factors well within the purview of those of ordinary skill in the art. These include without limitation the type and nature of the active agent being formulated; the subject to which the agent-containing composition is to be administered; the intended route of administration of the composition; and, the therapeutic indication being targeted. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include both aqueous and non-aqueous liquid media, as well as a variety of solid and semi-solid dosage forms. Such carriers can include a number of different ingredients and additives in addition to the active agent, such additional ingredients being included in the formulation for a variety of reasons, e.g., stabilization of the active agent, binders, etc., well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Descriptions of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and factors involved in their selection, are found in a variety of readily available sources such as, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th Edition (1985), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The compounds of Formula (I) may be administered by any means suitable for the condition to be treated, which may depend on the need for site-specific treatment or quantity of drug to be delivered. Topical administration is generally preferred for skin-related diseases, and systematic treatment preferred for cancerous or pre-cancerous conditions, although other modes of delivery are contemplated. For example, the compounds may be delivered orally, such as in the form of tablets, capsules, granules, powders, or liquid formulations including syrups; topically, such as in the form of solutions, suspensions, gels or ointments; sublingually; bucally; parenterally, such as by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular or intrasternal injection or infusion techniques (e.g., as sterile injectable aq. or non-aq. solutions or suspensions); nasally such as by inhalation spray; topically, such as in the form of a cream or ointment; rectally such as in the form of suppositories; or liposomally. Dosage unit formulations containing non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles or diluents may be administered. The compounds may be administered in a form suitable for immediate release or extended release. Immediate release or extended release may be achieved with suitable pharmaceutical compositions or, particularly in the case of extended release, with devices such as subcutaneous implants or osmotic pumps.

Exemplary compositions for rectal administration include suppositories which may contain, for example, suitable non-irritating excipients, such as cocoa butter, synthetic glyceride esters or polyethylene glycols, which are solid at ordinary temperatures but liquefy and/or dissolve in the rectal cavity to release the drug. The therapeutically-effective amount of a compound of the present invention may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, and includes exemplary dosage amounts for a mammal of from about 0.05 to 1000 mg/kg; 1-1000 mg/kg; 1-50 mg/kg; 5-250 mg/kg; 250-1000 mg/kg of body weight of active compound per day, which may be administered in a single dose or in the form of individual divided doses, such as from 1 to 4 times per day. It will be understood that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular subject may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the species, age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the subject, the mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and severity of the particular condition. Preferred subjects for treatment include animals, most preferably mammalian species such as humans, and domestic animals such as dogs, cats, horses, and the like. Thus, when the term “patient” is used herein, this term is intended to include all subjects, most preferably mammalian species that are affected by mediation of IRAK-4 enzyme levels. Biological Assays IRAK4 Inhibition Assay The assays were performed in U-bottom 384-well plates. The final assay volume was 30 μL prepared from 15 μL additions of enzyme and substrates (fluoresceinated peptide and ATP) and test compounds in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.015% Brij 35 and 4 mM DTT). The reaction was initiated by the combination of IRAK4 with substrates and test compounds. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. and terminated by adding 45 μL of 35 mM EDTA to each sample. The reaction mixture was analyzed on the Caliper LABCHIP® 3000 (Caliper, Hopkinton, Mass.) by electrophoretic separation of the fluorescent substrate and phosphorylated product Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition and vehicle-only reactions for 0% inhibition. The final concentrations of reagents in the assays are ATP, 500 μM; FL-IPTSPITTTYFFFKKK peptide 1.5 μM; IRAK4, 0.6 nM; and DMSO, 1.6%. PBMC TLR2 Induced IL-6 Assay Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from human blood containing the anti-coagulant EDTA (2.5 mM) by centrifugation over a FICOLL® gradient. PBMCs (250000 cells/well) were cultured in assay media (RPMI with 10% heat inactivated FCS) with compounds for 30 minutes at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 incubator. Following pretreatment with compounds, cells were stimulated for 5 hours with 10 μg/ml lipoteichoic acid (Invivogen, San Diego, Calif.), a TLR2 agonist. At the end of the culture, plates were centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 10 minutes to pellet the cells. Supernatants were harvested and analyzed for IL-6 levels by ELISA (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.).

The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized using the methods described below, together with synthetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those described below. All references cited herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety herein by reference. The reactions and techniques described in this section are performed in solvents appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and are suitable for the transformations being effected. Also, in the description of the synthetic methods described below, it is to be understood that all proposed reaction conditions, including choice of solvent, reaction atmosphere, reaction temperature, duration of the experiment and work up procedures, are chosen to be the conditions standard for that reaction, which should be readily recognized by one skilled in the art. It is understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on various portions of the molecule must be compatible with the reagents and reactions proposed. Such restrictions to the substituents that are compatible with the reaction conditions will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art and alternate methods must then be used. This will sometimes require a judgment to modify the order of the synthetic steps or to select one particular process scheme over another in order to obtain a desired compound of the invention. It will also be recognized that another major consideration in the planning of any synthetic route in this field is the judicious choice of the protecting group used for protection of the reactive functional groups present in the compounds described in this invention. An authoritative account describing the many alternatives to the trained practitioner is Greene et al. (Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley and Sons (1999)). Compounds of the general Formula (I) can be prepared according to the method outlined in Scheme 1. Hydrolysis of ester (1) to the acid 1.1 followed by reaction with an amine using standard amide bond forming conditions can afford the dichloro amide 1.2. Selective displacement of the C4 chloride by reacting with an amine can afford the mono-chloro product 1.3. Reaction of 1.3 with an appropriate nucleophile, such as an amine, in the presence of a catalyst, such as palladium, can afford compounds of the general formula I. Alternatively, the order of reactions can be modified to change the overall synthesis in order to allow for variations at different positions of the molecule at different stages of the preparation. For example, in Scheme 2, the chloride 1 may be reacted with an amine first to form the mono-chlorinated ester 2.1. Subsequent reaction with another amine, either in the presence of a metal catalyst or thermally in the presence of acid, may form the disubstituted intermediate 2.2. Hydrolysis of the ester to acid 2.3 followed by amide bond formation can afford the final analog 2.4. An additional variation on the order of substitution is shown in Scheme 3. First, reacting the dichloride with an amine may afford compound 3.1. Hydrolysis of the ester with a base, such as NaOH or KOH, may afford the acid 3.2. This acid may be reacted with an amine using standard amide bond forming reaction conditions, such as HOBt, EDC and DIPEA, in an appropriate solvent to form the amide 3.3, similar to amide 1.3 in Scheme 1. Subsequent aryl amine or heteroaryl amine coupling in the presence of a metal catalyst such as palladium, may afford the final compound 3.4. Another variation involves the synthesis of a differentially halogenated pyridine core to allow for variation of the HNR3R4 substituent at the last stage of the synthesis. 6-Bromo-4-choronicotinic acid may be reacted with a halogenating reagent, such as oxalyl chloride, to afford the acid chloride 4.1. This may be further reacted with an amine in the presence of a base, such as DIPEA or TEA, in an appropriate solvent, such as DCM, to afford the amide 4.2. Amide 4.2 may be reacted with another amine in the presence of a base, such as Cs2CO3 or K2CO3 and a metal catalyst, such as Pd, in a solvent to afford compound 4.3. Finally, compound 4.3 may be reacted with an amine in the presence of a base at elevated temperature to afford compound 4.4. It should be also noted, and obvious to those skilled in the art, that synthetic manipulations of the incorporated R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 groups is possible. An illustrative example is shown in Scheme 5. The butyl ester incorporated in compound 5.1 may be converted to the acid 5.2 upon treatment with an acid, such as TFA, in an appropriate solvent, such as DCM. Further reaction of 5.2 with an amine in the presence of amide bond forming reagents may afford compounds such as 5.3. It should be obvious to those skilled in the art that other functionalities than a carboxylate may be present for subsequent functionalization. For example, nitro groups can be converted readily to amines and subsequently functionalized, and halogens can be readily converted to aryl amines or nitriles. Another variation on the chemistry in Scheme 5 is outlined in Scheme 6. Alkyl groups may be functionalized, as in the alcohol 6.1, then subsequently transformed via standard chemical manipulations to compounds such as the fluoro analog 6.2. Subsequent conversion of the ester to the acid then amide and amine coupling at the remaining pyridine chloride may afford analogs such as 6.3. It should be obvious to one skilled in the art that these transformations are not limited to the example shown and can be applied to a variety of chemical substrates to afford the desired compounds. Additionally, variations to the R1 group can be made via functionalization after incorporating onto the pyridine scaffold. For example, in Scheme 7, an appropriately protected amine is coupled to the pyridine acid via standard amide bond forming conditions to form 7.2. Compound 7.2 may be deprotected to reveal the amine 7.3 which can be reacted with a variety of reagents (acids, acid chlorides, sulfonyl chlorides, isocyanates, aldehydes, etc.) to form compounds of the general formula 7.4. Similarly, a substituted amino ester may be coupled to the pyridine acid core to furnish the ester 8.1 which may be saponified to the acid 8.2. Subsequent reaction with amines under amide bond forming reaction conditions may form the compounds 8.3. Substitution at either R2 or R5 may be accomplished via the methods outlined in Scheme 9. Preparation of an appropriately functionalized precursor, such as compound 9.1, and reaction with a variety of reagents, such as amines, aryl cross coupling partners, and cyanide may form compounds of the formula 9.2. For example, compound 9.3 may be converted to compound 9.4 via reaction with an amine at elevated temperature. EXAMPLES Preparation of compounds of Formula (I), and intermediates used in the preparation of compounds of Formula (I), can be prepared using procedures shown in the following Examples and related procedures. The methods and conditions used in these examples, and the actual compounds prepared in these Examples, are not meant to be limiting, but are meant to demonstrate how the compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared. Starting materials and reagents used in these examples, when not prepared by a procedure described herein, are generally either commercially available, or are reported in the chemical literature, or may be prepared by using procedures described in the chemical literature.

Example 1 6-((5-Cyano-2-pyridinyl)amino)-4-(((1S,2S)-2,3-dihydroxy-1-phenylpropyl)amino)-N-methylnicotinamide Step 1: Synthesis of 4,6-dichloronicotinic acid: Ethyl 4,6-dichloronicotinate in ethanol (20 mL) and water (10 mL) was stirred at ambient temperature. Lithium hydroxide was added to the reaction mixture and stirred at room temperature for 4 h. The solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure, diluted with EtOAc and added water. The aqueous layer was collected and acidified to pH 3-4 using citric acid. The mixture was allowed to stir for 10 min in an ice bath the precipitated product was filtered and dried under vacuum to furnish compound. Step 2: Synthesis of 4,6-dichloro-N-methylnicotinamide: To a stirred solution of 4,6-dichloronicotinic acid (2) (10 g, 1 equiv.) in DCM (100 mL), DMF (catalytic amt.) was added at 0° C. Oxalyl chloride (14 mL, 3 equiv.) was added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to ambient temperature and stirred for 30 min and was then heated at reflux for 2 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated to remove excess of oxalyl chloride and redissolved in DCM (50 mL) and cooled to −20° C. Methyl amine was added in portions to the reaction mixture and stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The reaction was quenched with water followed by NaHCO3 solution. The layers were separated and the organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to obtain the desired compound, 6-chloro-4-(isopropylamino)nicotinamide. LC/MS: ZORBAX® SB C18, 4.6×50 mm, 5 μm; Solvent A=10% MeOH: 90% H2O: 0.1% TFA; Solvent B=90% MeOH: 10% H2O: 0.1% TFA; gradient 0-100% B over 2 min (3 min run time); retention time: 0.874 min; LCMS (ES-API), m/z 205 (M+H). Step 3: Synthesis of ((2S,3S)-3-phenyloxiran-2-yl)methanol: (−)-DIPT (0.524 g, 0.075 equiv.) was dissolved in DCM (250 mL) and cooled to −30° C. Molecular sieves (1.6 g), titanium (IV) isopropoxide (0.437 mL, 0.05 equiv.) and t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP in decane) (5.78 mL, 2 equiv.) were added sequentially. The mixture was allowed to stir for 1 h. (E)-3-phenylprop-2-en-1-ol (4 g, 1 equiv.) in DCM (10 mL) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 3 h at −30° C. The reaction was quenched with 8 mL of 10% aqueous NaOH solution followed by brine solution. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 10° C. and stirred for 10 min at 10° C. Anhydrous sodium sulfate (2 g) and CELITE® (2 g) were added to the reaction mixture and stirred for another 50 min. The reaction mixture was then filtered through a pad of CELITE®. The residue was washed with ether and the filtrate was concentrated. The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography using ethyl acetate: pet.ether as eluent to afford ((2S,3S)-3-phenyloxiran-2-yl)methanol. 1H NMR: 400 MHz, CDCl3: δ 1.19-1.29 (m, 1H), 4.33 (t, J=4.80 Hz, 2H), 6.34-6.41 (m, 1H), 6.61-6.65 (m, 1H), 7.23-7.27 (m, 1H), 7.30-7.38 (m, 4H). Step 4: Synthesis of (2R,3R)-3-amino-3-phenylpropane-1,2-diol: To a solution of ((2S,3S)-3-phenyloxiran-2-yl)methanol (0.5 g, 1 equiv.) in 2-propanol (5 mL) was added aqueous NH4OH (10 mL). The reaction mixture was heated at 84° C. for 12 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated and the crude material was azeotroped with toluene (3×30 mL) to afford (2R,3R)-3-amino-3-phenylpropane-1,2-diol. The compound was taken to next step without purification. Step 5: A mixture of 4,6-dichloro-N-methylnicotinamide (410 mg, 2 mmol), (2S,3S)-3-amino-3-phenylpropane-1,2-diol (502 mg, 3 mmol) and DIPEA (419 μL, 2.4 mmol) in DMA (2 mL) was stirred at 110° C. for 6 h. The vessel was allowed to cool to room temperature and the reaction mixture was separated between ethyl acetate and pH 4 solution.
