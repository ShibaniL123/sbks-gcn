REGULATION OF CANCER USING NATURAL COMPOUNDS AND/OR DIET CROSS-REFERENCE TO A RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/784,386, filed March 14, 2013, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, including all figures, tables and amino acid or nucleic acid sequences. Due to a shift in most cancer cells from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis (known as the Warburg effect) cancer can be viewed as a metabolic disease where energy flux is shifted from a highly efficient method of generating energy (36 molecules of ATP from 1 molecule of glucose) to an inefficient method (4 molecules of ATP from one molecule of glucose). The result is that cancer cells expend an enormous amount of glucose to survive and multiply. While controversy exists as to the relationship between the Warburg effect and altered signaling pathways, the combined reliance of tumor cells for excessive amounts of glucose and signaling pathway alterations suggest that targeting these two related phenomena may provide better outcomes in cancer treatment. Most cancer treatments employ the use of toxic chemicals aimed at killing cancerous cells. While these treatments are highly effective, unfortunately, they have similar effects on normal, non-cancerous cells as well. The key to developing an effective and well-tolerated chemotherapy regime is to balance the positive tumor killing effects of the compounds with the toxic side effects. The use of non-toxic compounds that are able to target altered signaling pathways and influence energy flux may provide an effective and tolerable treatment. An additional advantage of using non-toxic approach is the ability to apply multiple agents simultaneously with reduced chances of cumulative toxicity. The current invention provides treatment of proliferative disorders that target altered signaling pathways and energy flux in cancerous cells. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The current invention provides a treatment of a proliferative disease comprising, administering to a subject in need of a treatment against a proliferative disease, a composition comprising one or more natural products (compounds) and, optionally, simultaneously providing to the subject a low carbohydrate diet. In certain embodiments of the invention, the subject consumes (or is provided) a modified ketogenic diet (mKD) or a ketogenic diet (KD). Thus, the current invention also provides a therapy for a subject in need of a treatment against a proliferative disorder, the therapy comprising administering to a subject consuming a mKD or KD diet a composition comprising one or more natural compounds (component(s)) selected from, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), curcumin, compositions comprising glucosinolates and/or derivatives thereof, such as glucoraphanin and/or sulforaphane (SFN) (as found in broccoli sprouts or sprouts of other cruciferous vegetables), and, optionally, Daikon radish sprout, a Daikon radish sprout extract or a powder of said extract or the Daikon radish sprout. In another aspect of the invention, the method of treating a proliferative disorder comprises administering one or more component(s) selected from, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), curcumin, compositions comprising glucosinolates and/or derivatives thereof, such as glucoraphanin and/or SFN (derived from sources such as broccoli sprouts, sprouts of other cruciferous vegetables or cruciferous vegetables themselves) and, optionally, Daikon radish sprout, a Daikon radish sprout extract or a powder of said extract or the Daikon radish sprout, and, optionally, simultaneously providing a low carbohydrate, mKD or KD diet. Another aspect of the invention provides methods that attenuate/reducing the loss or the proliferative ability of neural stem cells (NSC) or their progeny [collectively called precursor cells] of the CNS in a subject developing a tumor or having a tumor or in a subject having a neurodegenerative disease or disorder, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), stroke, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and Neuromyelitis optica (ΝΜΟ) or that which is associated to aging or age-related cognitive decline. Thus, various embodiments of this aspect of the invention provide methods of attenuating/reducing the loss in activity of precursor cells or a loss in the number of precursor cells in the CNS in a subject developing a tumor or having a tumor or in a subject having a neurodegenerative disease or disorder or a age related reduction in CNS function, comprising administering to a subject a composition comprising one or more natural compounds (component(s)) selected from, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), curcumin, compositions comprising glucosinolates and/or derivatives thereof, such as glucoraphanin and/or sulforaphane (SFN) (such as broccoli sprouts, sprouts of other cruciferous vegetables or cruciferous vegetables themselves), and, optionally, Daikon radish sprout, a Dailon radish sprout extract or a powder of said extract or the Daikon radish sprout and, optionally, simultaneously providing a low carbohydrate, mKD or KD diet.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS Figure 1: Effect of mKD on blood glucose levels. Blood glucose level was compared between animals that were fed respectively for 2 weeks with the different diets [control, ketogenic diet (KD), modified ketogenic diet (mKD) or mKD/NP], Glucose level was similar between the KD, mKD, Natural Products (ΝΡ) and mKD/NP groups, which were significantly decreased compared to control. *, ***, compared to control, p<0.01, 0.001, 1-way ANOVA. Treatments composition is as follow: Control (55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat), KD (92% Fat, 3% carbohydrate, 5% protein), mKD= 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from MCT, Neobee 598), 30% Protein, Natural Products (ΝΡ) [55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat + SFN (25mg/kg; BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg)], mKD/NP= mKD+ Natural Products (ΝΡ). Figure 2: Effect of mKD on blood ketone levels. Blood ketones levels was compared between animals that were fed respectively for 2 weeks with the different diets [control, ketogenic diet (KD), modified ketogenic diet (mKD) or mKD/NP], Ketones level was similar between the KD, mKD, Natural Products (ΝΡ) and mKD/NP groups, which were significantly decreased compared to control. ***, compared to control, p<0.001, 1-way ANOVA. Treatments composition is as follow: Control (55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat), KD (92% Fat, 3% carbohydrate, 5% protein), mKD = 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from MCT, Neobee 598), 30% Protein, Natural Products (ΝΡ) [55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat + SFN (25mg/kg; BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg)], mKD/NP = mKD + Natural Products (ΝΡ). Figure 3: Effect of mKD/NP on body weight. Toxicity of mKD/NP was assessed by monitoring body weight over 16 days. Over the course of the study the mKD/NP treated animals did not lose weight and even shown and increased body weight compared to control animals. p<0.005, Finear regression. Figure 4: Toxicology - Blood tests. Toxicity was assessed after 4 weeks of treatment (mKD/NP) via plasma measurements of the following analytes (Comparative Clinical Pathology Services, LLC): creatinine (kidney), alanine transaminase (ALT, liver), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, liver), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP, pancreas). No difference was observed between mKD/NP treated animals compared to controls. p>0.1, 1-sample t-test. Figure 5: Non-Tumor Death - ΤΜΖ vs. mKD/NP. Mortality rate unrelated to tumor was monitored during the course of treatments. Compared to conventional therapy (Temozolomide [TMZ], 20mg/kg), mKD/NP treatment decreased mortality by 10 fold. **, p<0.01, t-test. Figure 6: Body weight - TMZ vs. mKD/NP. Toxicity/safety of mKD/NP was compared to standard of care (TMZ, 20mg/kg) by monitoring body weight after 4 days of treatment. No difference was observed between control and mKD/NP treated animals (p>0.05, 1-way ANOVA) whereas animals treated with conventional treatment showed significant loss of body weight compared to control and mKD/NP. ##, ###, p<0.001, p<0.0001, 1-way ANOVA, compared to TMZ. Figure 7: ΝΡ in vitro - Fold Expansion. Primary human GBM stem cell lines were treated daily for 4 out of 5 days in culture with EGCG (8 μΜ), Curcumin (0.5 μΜ) and sulforaphane (2.5 μΜ) or a combination of all three NPs (E+C+S). Cells were passed after 5-7 days and cell counts were performed. All individual compounds exhibited a significant reduction in mean daily fold expansion of GB cells. The combination of the three natural products (ΝΡ) together demonstrated the strongest effect. The synergistic effect of the combination suggests that each component of ΝΡ is affecting non-overlapping mechanisms. *, **, ***, p<0.01, p<0.01, p<0.0001, 1-way ANOVA, compared to control. # # #, p<0.001, 1-way ANOVA, compared to ΝΡ. Micrographs show cultures after 4 days of exposure to the different treatments. Figure 8: Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves - Individual NPs vs. Combination. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor progression was followed using calipers by recording 2 measurements of tumor diameter and converting this into a volume using the following formula: (4/3)π1ℓ3. For spheroid tumors the two measurements were averaged to determine the diameter of the sphere. In the case of ellipsoid tumors (i.e. prolate or oblate spheroid mass) the formula used was: (4/3)π * (d/2) * (d/2)2. In this case the second measurement “d2” would count twice and “d” only once. For prolate spheroids, the long measurement occurs once while the short measurement occurs twice. Conversely, for the oblate spheroid tumors, the long measurement occurs twice while the short one occurs only once. Following this criteria, tumor volume was tracked over time. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (tumor volume of 1700mm3). The fraction of animals living as a function of time is represented using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Animals treated with ΝΡ demonstrated a significant improvement over controls or animals treated with individual component (*, **, p<0.05, p<0.005, Log rank test). Figures 9Α-9Β: ΝΡ - Effect on cancer stem cells (CSCs). Patient derived GB cell lines cultured in defined medium were treated with ΝΡ. After 5-7 days in culture, spheres were harvested, dissociated into single cells suspension and plated at low density in 96 well plates in control conditions. Seven to ten days later the number of spheres was counted (A: clonogenic frequency) and sized (Β). This assay is able to access the effects of treatment on the sphere forming cells (i.e clonogenic frequency in A) and on the proliferative potential of each of the clones (Β). Exposure of human GB cells to NPs for 7 days in vitro results in a significant reduction in the clonogenic frequency and the proliferative ability of the clones. **, p<0.01, t-test. Figures 10Α-10Β: ΝΡ - Effect CSCs. ΝΡ targets tumor-propagating cell in vitro. A) Patient derived hGB cells were serially passed in culture for 5 passages under a variety of treatment conditions. Cells were treated with EGCG (8 μΜ), curcumin (0.5 μΜ, SFN (2.5 μΜ) or their combination (ΝΡ). ΝΡ had the greatest growth inhibitory effect. *, *** p<0.05, p<0.001 compared to control, ### p<0.001 compared to ΝΡ, Linear regression. Β) The rate of tumor propagating cell aka cancer stem cell (CSC) expansion (Kll) is directly correlated to the probability CSCs undergo self-renewing symmetric division and can be calculated by taking the natural logarithm of the fold expansion and dividing by the passage time (Deleyrolle et αℓ., 2011). Human GB cells were cultured in the neurosphere assay over 5 passages during which CSC expansion rate was evaluated. Only SFN or ΝΡ treated groups demonstrated significant decrease of CSCs self-renewing symmetric division rate compared to control. Also ΝΡ exhibited the greatest effect suggesting a unique synergistic effect. ***, p<0.001 compared to control, ###, p<0.001 compared to ΝΡ, 1-way ANOVA. Figure 11: Daily fold expansion - Effect of ΝΡ and ΤΜΖ in vitro. Primary human GB stem cell lines were treated daily for 4 out of 5 days in culture ΤΜΖ alone or in combination with EGCG (8 μΜ), Curcumin (0.5 μΜ), sulforaphane (2.5 μΜ) or a combination of all three (ΝΡ). Cells were passed after 5-7 days and cell counts performed. The addition of EGCG, curcumin or SFN to ΤΜΖ treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the mean daily fold expansion of hGB cells compared to control. However, ΝΡ had the greatest effect demonstrating synergistic effect. The stars (*) are compared to control, # to ΤΜΖ alone and $ to the different combinations of ΤΜΖ with each of the individual natural products. 1 symbol, p<0.05, 3 symbols, p<0.001, 1-way ANOVA. Figure 12: Effect of mKD on body weight - 24 day treatment. Toxicity and nutritional sufficiency of mKD were assessed by monitoring body weight. Animals fed with a KD demonstrated a significant weight loss compared to controls whereas mKD treated group did not show weight loss over the course of 24 days of treatment and exhibited a body weight similar to controls. *, **, p<0.05, p<0.005, 1-way ANOVA. Figure 13: Effect of mKD on tumor volume progression. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor dimensions were monitored 3 times per week using calipers and volume was calculated. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1700mm3). Animals treated with KD or mKD showed similar tumor progression and demonstrated a significant slower progression compared to controls (**, p<0.005, two-way ANOVA). Figure 14: Effect of mKD on KM curve. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor dimensions were monitored 3 times per week using calipers and volume was calculated. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint based on a tumor volume of 1700mm3 calculated from measurements made with a caliper. The fraction of animals living as a function of time is represented using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Animals treated with KD or mKD showed similar survival and demonstrated a significant improvement over controls (**, p<0.005, Log rank test). Figure 15: Effect of mKD progression free survival. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor volume was calculated 3 times per week and the time from a barely palpable tumor [approximately 65mm3] to a tumor of a significant size [300mm3] was calculated. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals treated with KD or mKD showed similar progression free survival (time during which tumor volume is maintained lower than 300mm3) and demonstrated a significant improvement over controls (*, **, p<0.05, p<0.005, t-test). Figure 16: Effect of mKD on overall survival. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor dimensions were monitored 3 times per week using calipers and volume was calculated. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1700mm3). The average time to reach endpoint volume was then compared. Animals treated with KD or mKD showed similar overall survival and demonstrated a significant improvement over controls (**, p<0.005, Log rank test). Figure 17: Effect of mKD/NP on proliferation (In vitro). Human GB cells were plated at 50,000 cells per ml in the neurosphere assay. The cells were treated with the indicated treatments and harvested for cell number quantification after 7 days of culture. The three treatment groups demonstrated significant decrease of proliferation compared to control, with mKD/NP treated animals showing significant difference compared to mKD and ΝΡ groups. **, compared to control, ## compared to mKD/NP, p<0.001, t-test. Details of the treatments: [1] mKD= 4mM ketones [Beta Hydroxybutyrate] (Single treatment applied 2 days post plating), [2] ΝΡ= EGCG [8μΜ] + SFN [2.5μΜ] + Curcumin [0.5pM]: daily treatment from day 3 to day 6, [3] mKD/NP= 4mM ketones + EGCG [8μΜ] + SFN [5μΜ] + Curcumin [0.5μΜ]. Of note, glucose level was 65mg/dL in the mKD and mKD/NP groups, and 130mg/dL in the control and ΝΡ groups. Figure 18: Effect of mKD/NP on CSC. Sphere forming frequency was measured to evaluate the effect of the different treatments on the proliferation of CSCs. Human GB cells were plated at 50,000 cells per ml in the neurosphere assay. The cells were treated with the indicated treatments and harvested to be plated in regular medium (no treatment) at clonal density for comparison of their respective sphere formation ability. mKD/NP treated cells showed significant decrease of sphere forming ability compared to the control group. **, p<0.005, t-test. Figure 19: Effect of mKD/NP on CSC expansion. The rate of cancer stem cell (CSC) expansion (Kll) is directly correlated to the probability CSCs undergo self-renewing symmetric division and can be calculated by taking the natural logarithm of the fold expansion and dividing by the passage time (Deleyrolle et αℓ., 2011). Human GB cells were cultured in the neurosphere assay over 4 passages during which CSC expansion rate was evaluated.

Figure 20: Effect of mKD/NP on Tumor Progression. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor dimensions were monitored 3 times per week using calipers and volume was calculated. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3). Animals treated with mKD/NP demonstrated a significant slower tumor progression compared to controls or animals treated with mKD or ΝΡ (**, *** p<0.01, p<0.002, two-way ANOVA). These results demonstrate a synergistic effect in vivo between mKD and ΝΡ. Figure 21: Effect of mKD/NP on KM curve. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor volume was monitored 3 times per week. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3).

Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3). The average time to reach endpoint volume was then compared. Animals treated with mKD/NP demonstrated a significant increase of overall survival compared to controls or animals treated with mKD or ΝΡ (*, **, *** p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.002, compared to mKD/NP, t-test). Figure 23: Effect of mKD/NP on Progression Free Survival. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor volume was calculated 3 times per week and the time from a barely palpable tumor [approximately 65mm3] to a tumor of a significant size [300mm3] was calculated. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. mKD/NP animals demonstrated a significant increase of tumor progression free survival (time during which tumor volume is maintained lower than 300mm3) compared to controls or animals treated with mKD or ΝΡ (***, ρ0.0001, compared to mKD/NP, 1-way ANOVA). These results suggest a synergistic effect between mKD and ΝΡ treatments. Figure 24: Effect of mKD/NP on KM after intracranial inoculation of hGB cells. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 200Κ hGB cells in the striatum. Treatments were initiated 3 days post implant. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint marked by the development of neurologic signs (including, but not limited to, lethargy, paralysis, or seizure). The fraction of animals living as a function of time is represented using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. mKD/NP treated animals demonstrated a significant increased survival compared to control animals (*, ρ=0.014, Log-Rank test).

The average time to reach endpoint volume (i.e. overall survival time) was then compared. mKD/NP treated animals demonstrated a significant increased overall survival compared to controls (*, p<0.05, t-test). Figure 26: Tumor Progression - ΤΜΖ vs. mKD/NP. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank.

Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3). Animals treated with standard of care (temozolomide, ΤΜΖ, 5mg/kg) or mKD/NP demonstrated a similar and significant slower tumor progression compared to controls (***, ρ0.0001, two-way ANOVA).

Figure 28: mKD/NP - Adjuvant Tumor Progression. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ ΤΜΖ sensitive hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor volume was monitored 3 times per week using a caliper and tumor volume was calculated. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals treated with standard of care (temozolomide, ΤΜΖ, 5mg/kg) or mKD/NP demonstrated a similar and significant slower tumor progression compared to controls. The combination of standard of care with mKD/NP showed a significant decrease of tumor progression compared to controls and mKD/NP treated group. **, ***, p<0.005, p<0.0001, two-way ANOVA. Figure 29: Effect of mKD/NP on tumor progression of ΤΜΖ resistant cells. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ ΤΜΖ unresponsive hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor volume was monitored 3 times per week using a caliper and tumor volume was calculated. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals treated with mKD/NP demonstrated a significant slower tumor progression compared to controls demonstrating the efficacy of this treatment as a second line therapy after resistance to conventional treatment has been developed. The combination of standard of care (ΤΜΖ, 5mg/kg) with mKD/NP showed a significant decrease of tumor progression compared to control, ΤΜΖ and mKD/NP treated groups. This result demonstrates the ability of mKD/NP to re-sensitize cells to conventional treatment after acquired resistance. ***, p<0.0001, two-way ANOVA. Figure 30: Effect of mKD/NP on time to tumor initiation - GB. Animals were placed on mKD/NP for 2 months prior to sub-Q tumor implantation. After 2 months of treatment the NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor growth was then monitored 3 times per week to determine the time between tumor cell implantation and the time a tumor could be palpable (i.e. reaching a volume approximating 65mm3). The graph depicts the average time between implant and positive palpation. The mKD/NP treated group demonstrated a time to tumor initiation approximately 3 times greater than in the controls (***,p<0.01, t-test). Figure 31: Effect of mKD/NP on tumor forming frequency - GB. Animals were placed on mKD/NP for 2 months prior to sub-Q tumor implantation. After 2 months of treatment the NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor growth was then monitored 3 times per week to determine the time between tumor cell implantation and the time a tumor could be palpable (i.e. reaching a volume approximating 65mm3). The percentage of animals that had developed tumor was recorded. mKD/NP pre-treated group showed a 60% decrease in tumor initiation compared to controls. Figure 32: Effect of mKD/NP on tumor forming frequency - Lung Cancer. NOD/SCID animals were treated for 2 weeks with control diet or mKD/NP before to be inoculated with 2Μ of lung carcinoma cells (Α549) in the right flank. Tumor growth was then monitored 3 times per week. 21 days after implant almost 90% of the control animals developed tumor whereas only 50% of the animals treated with mKD/NP showed tumor formation. Figures 33Α-33Β: Effect of mKD/NP on neural stem cell (NSC) activity. A) mKD/NP protects neural stem cells from dysregulation related to tumor development. It has been demonstrated that the presence of a tumor can create a chronic inflammatory response sufficient to induce damage and cellular dysregulation in tissues distant from the tumor site (Redon et αℓ., 2010). We demonstrated that development of a tumor mass following subcutaneous implant of hGB cells in the right flank of NOD/SCID animals downregulated neural stem cell activity (based on BrdU incorporation) in area related to cognition (e.g. hippocampus). Animals treated with mKD/NP did not demonstrate any decrease in NSC activity compared to the non-tumor bearing group. These results demonstrate a protective effect of mKD/NP on NSC activity. Β) hNSC were plated at 20Κ cells per lOOul of medium and cultured in the neurosphere assay for 14 days. Starting 2 days post plating, the cells were daily treated with EGCG (8 μΜ), Curcumin (0.5 μΜ), sulforaphane (SFN, 2.5 μΜ) or a combination of all three ΝΡ. After 14 days in culture, ΜΤΤ assay was performed to measure cell viability. Only the combination of the 3 natural products (ΝΡ) exhibited a significant effect compared to control. Cells treated with ΝΡ displayed a 70% increase in cell viability compared to controls or each individual component. ***, p<0.0001, compared to ΝΡ, 1-way ANOVA. These data demonstrate that ΝΡ treatment increases survival of NSCs. Figure 34: Optimization mKD/NP - Tumor progression. The presence of Daikon Radish Sprout Powder (DRSP) enhances the effect of mKD/NP. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor progression was monitored by measuring tumor volume 3 times per week using a caliper. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals treated with mKD/NP containing DRSP demonstrated a significant slower tumor progression compared to controls or animals treated with mKD/NP not containing DRSP (*, ***, p<0.05, p<0.001, Two-way ANOVA). Treatments: Control: 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. mKD/NP.001 = 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from MCT, Neobee 598), 30% Protein + Natural Products (ΝΡ) containing SFN (25mg/kg;BSP100%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). mKD/NP.002 = 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from MCT, Neobee 598), 30% Protein + Natural Products (ΝΡ) containing SFN (25mg/kg; BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). Figure 35: Optimization mKD/NP - Progression free survival. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor volume was calculated 3 times per week and the time from a barely palpable tumor [approximately 65mm3] to a tumor of a significant size [300mm3] was calculated. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals treated with mKD/NP.002 (containing DRSP) demonstrated a significant increase of tumor progression free survival time (time during which tumor volume is maintained lower than 300mm3) compared to controls or animals treated with mKD/NP.001 (not containing DRSP). *, p<0.05, F-test, compared to mKD/NP.002. Figure 36: Optimization mKD/NP - overall survival. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor volume was monitored 3 times per week. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3). The average time to reach endpoint volume (i.e. overall survival time) was then compared. Animals treated with mKD/NP.002 (containing DRSP) demonstrated a significant increase of mean survival compared to controls or animals treated with mKD/NP.001 (not containing DRSP). *, p<0.05, F-test, compared to mKD/NP.002. Figures 37Α-37Β: Optimization mKD/NP - Ki67 and pStat3. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor volume was monitored 3 times per week. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3) and the tumors were harvested and prepared to quantify tumor cell proliferation using Ki67 and pStat3 labeling. (A) The percentage of immunoreactive cells was quantified using flow cytometry. Animals treated with mKD/NP.002 (containing DRSP) demonstrated a significant decrease of proliferation compared to controls or animals treated with mKD/NP.001 (not containing DRSP). *, **, p<0.05, ρΟ.001, t-test, compared to mKD/NP.002. (Β) Stat3 activation (via phosphorylation) is required for proliferation of cancer cells in general and in Glioblastoma (Sherry et αℓ., 2009). Targeting Stat3 is thus a potential target for cancer therapy. mKD/NP is able to inhibit the phosphorylation of Stat3 compared to controls. This effect is potentiated with mKD/NP.002 when DRSP is included in the treatment as noted above. Figure 38: Effect of mKD/NP on colon cancer - tumor progression. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 2Μ of colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (ΗΤ-29) in the right flank. Tumor progression was monitored by measuring tumor volume 3 times per week using a caliper. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1000mm3). Animals treated with mKD/NP demonstrated a significant slower tumor progression compared to controls (***, p<0.0001, two-way ANOVA). Figure 39: Effect of mKD/NP on colon cancer - tumor volume.

Figure 55: Effect of mKD/NP on apoptosis of hGB cells (in vivo). NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor volume was monitored 3 times per week using a caliper. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3) and the tumors were harvested and prepared to quantify tumor cell death using DAPI labeling to identify the SubGl area indicative of the apoptotic fraction. The percentage of apoptotic cells was quantified using flow cytometry. Animals treated with mKD/NP demonstrated a significant increase in cell death compared to controls (**, p<0.001 t-test). These data indicate that in vivo mKD/NP increases death of hGB cells. Figure 56: Effect of mKD/NP on tumor initiating cells (in vivo). NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor volume was monitored 3 times per week using a caliper. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3) and the tumors were harvested and prepared to quantify tumor cells expressing CD 133. CD 133 is a marker of tumor initiating cells. The percentage of CD 133 immunoreactive cells was quantified using flow cytometry. Sub-Q tumors derived from animals treated with mKD/NP demonstrated a lower amount of CD133+ve cells compared to controls. These data indicate that mKD/NP can target in vivo cancer stem cell (i.e. tumor initiating cells). Figure 57: Effect of mKD/NP on DNA damage in CSC (in vivo). NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor volume was monitored 3 times per week using a caliper. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3) and the tumors were harvested and prepared to quantify tumor cells colabled with CD 133 and the phosphorylated form of Η2ΑΧ (ρΗ2ΑΧ). ρΗ2ΑΧ is a marker of DNA double strand breaks. The percentage of CD133/pH2AX double immunoreactive cells was quantified using flow cytometry. Sub-Q tumors derived from animals treated with mKD/NP demonstrated an increase in the number of cancer stem cells (CD 133+) exhibiting DNA damages (ρΗ2ΑΧ+) compared to controls. These results show that mKD/NP can specifically target in vivo and induce DNA damages in cancer stem cells. Figures 58Α-58Β: Effect of mKD/NP on ΥΒ1 proliferation - MGMT independent sensitization of ΤΜΖ resistance (in vivo). NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor volume was monitored 3 times per week using a caliper. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3) and the tumors were harvested and prepared to quantify by flow cytometry the level of expression and phosphorylation of the Y-box binding protein 1 (ΥΒ1). YB-1 is upregulated in many human malignancies including hGB and is implicated in the maintenance of CSCs (Fotovati et αℓ., 2011). Not only is YB-1 critical for hGB maintenance and proliferation but it also plays a role in the mechanism (MGMT independent) of resistance to ΤΜΖ by repairing the DNA damages caused by the chemotherapy drug (Gao et αℓ., 2009). Hence, targeting YB-1 represents an appealing approach to inhibit hGB proliferation and to sensitize hGB to ΤΜΖ. Compared to controls, tumor derived from animals treated with mKD/NP demonstrated a significant decrease of ΥΒ1 level of expression (A) as well as of phosphorylation (Β). * p<0.05, F-test. These results demonstrate that mKD/NP can target the YB-1 pathway, proposing a mechanism by which the treatment is inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and is sensitizing the cells to ΤΜΖ via a mechanism independent to MGMT. Figure 59: Effect of mKD/NP on inhibiting chemoresistance in CSC (in vivo). NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor volume was monitored 3 times per week using a caliper. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3) and the tumors were harvested and prepared to quantify tumor cells colabled with CD 133 and NFkB. NFkB is an anti-apoptotic effector that also contribute to chemoresistance in hGB (Han ℮ΐ.αℓ., 2004). A) The percentage of CD133/NFkB double immunoreactive cells was quantified using flow cytometry. Tumor derived from animals treated with mKD/NP demonstrated a decrease in the number of cancer stem cells (CD 133+) positive for NFkB compared to controls. These results suggest that mKD/NP can target CSCs by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic effector NFkB. Figure 60: Effect of mKD/NP on MGMT expression (in vitro). Patient derived GB cells were treated in vitro with ΤΜΖ [10μΜ] or ΤΜΖ [10μΜ] & ΝΡ (EGCG (8 μΜ), Curcumin (0.5 μΜ) and sulforaphane (2.5 μΜ)). After seven days of treatment cells were harvested and analyzed for expression level of MGMT using flow cytometry. The median fluorescence in the two treated groups were compared relative to the untreated controls. The data indicates that ΤΜΖ induces nearly a 30% increase in MGMT expression and that ΝΡ is able to attenuate this increase to near control levels. Figures 61Α-61Β: Effect of mKD/NP on surviving expression (in vitro). A) hGB cells were cultured in the neurosphere assay. After 7 days in vitro, the cells were processed for immunolabeling and flow cytometry analysis to access Survivin (a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis for which the overexpression is associated with chemoresistance) level. Expression level of Survivin is increased with ΤΜΖ treatment (10μΜ, daily treatment for 7 days). This effect is reduced to control levels when ΤΜΖ treated cells are also exposed to ΝΡ [EGCG (8 μΜ), Curcumin (0.5 μΜ) and sulforaphane (2.5 μΜ), daily treatment for 4-7 days], Β) Similarly, ΝΡ reduces the fraction of cells expressing Survivin that is increased when cell are treated with ΤΜΖ. **, ***, compared to control; ###, compared to ΤΜΖ. 1-way ANOVA, 2 symbols p<0.01, 3 symbols ρ0.0001.

Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3) and the tumors were harvested and prepared to quantify tumor cells expressing MGMT and pSTAT3. A) MGMT provides resistance to ΤΜΖ. The percentage of MGMT immunoreactive cells was quantified using flow cytometry. Animals treated with mKD/NP demonstrated a decrease of MGMT+ve cells compared to controls. p<0.05, t-test. Β) Phosphorylation of Stat3 has been correlated with ΤΜΖ resistance through a mechanism dependent to MGMT (Kohsaka et αℓ., 2012). The ability of mKD/NP to decrease Stat3 activation and MGMT expression provide a potential mechanism by which mKD/NP sensitize tumor cells to ΤΜΖ (described in Fig. 29) via a MGMT dependent mechanism.

Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3) and the tumors were harvested and prepared to quantify tumor cells expressing ΖΕΒ1. ΖΕΒ1, a marker of tumor initiating cells, is an important candidate molecule for hGB recurrence, a marker of invasive tumor cells and a potential therapeutic target (Siebzehnrubl et αℓ., under review). The percentage of ΖΕΒ1 immunoreactive cells was quantified using flow cytometry. Tumors derived from animals treated with mKD/NP demonstrated a significant decrease of ΖΕΒ1+ν℮ cells compared to controls (*, p<0.05, t-test).

Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3) and the tumors were harvested and prepared to quantify by flow cytometry the percentage of tumor cells expressing NFkB. NFkB is an anti-apoptotic effector that also contribute to chemoresistance in hGB (Han et.al., 2004). Tumors derived from animals treated with mKD/NP demonstrated a significant decrease of NFkB+ve cells compared to controls (*, p<0.05, t-test). Figure 65: Effect of mKD/NP on Glut3 expression (in vivo). Many tumor cells display increased level of glucose metabolism compared with normal cells. Glucose uptake is mediated by the glucose transporter (GLUT) family including Glut 3 that has been reported to be upregulated in glioblastoma (Boado et αℓ., 1994) and to participate in the proliferation of tumor cells as well as in the acquired resistance to ΤΜΖ (Le Calve et αℓ., 2010). These findings suggest that selective targeting of Glut3 would delay tumor cells proliferation and development of ΤΜΖ resistance. NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Tumor volume was monitored 3 times per week using a caliper. Treatments were initiated when a palpable mass was identified [approximately 65mm3]. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3) and the tumors were harvested and prepared to quantify by flow cytometry the percentage of tumor cells expressing Glut3. Tumors derived from animals treated with mKD/NP demonstrated a significant decrease of Glut3+ve cells compared to controls (**, p<0.005, t-test). Figures 66A-66D: mTor pathway - In Vivo. mTor pathway is activated by growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals and is implicated in the control of cell growth, proliferation and survival. Deregulation of mTor pathway (e.g. up regulation of upstream activator such as ΑΚΤ or downstream effectors such as S6 and 4ΕΒΡ) has been reported in many cancers. mTor pathway is activated by the PI3K/AKT pathway. mTor activation leads to phosphorylation/activation of S6 and phosphorylation/inactivation of 4ΕΒΡ, the 2 best characterized downstream effectors of mTor regulating ribosomal biogenesis and proteins synthesis respectively. Therefore mTor is an appealing therapeutic target and mTor pathway inhibitors represent potential candidates for viable therapeutic strategies. A) NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3) and the tumors were harvested and prepared to quantify by flow cytometry the percentage of tumor cells expressing p-S6. Animals treated with mKD/NP demonstrated a significant decrease of pS6+ve cells compared to controls. (**, p<0.005, t-test). Β) Tissue specimens were harvested at endpoint and pS6 immunolabeling was compared between controls and mK/NP treated animals. Micrographs demonstrated a decreased pS6 staining in tumor treated with mKD/NP. C) NOD/SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ hGB cells in the right flank. Animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint (1500mm3) and the tumors were harvested and prepared to quantify by flow cytometry the percentage of tumor cells expressing ρ4ΑΒΡ1.

Decreased expression of pS6 and ρ4ΑΒΡ1 in the mKD/NP treated tumor was demonstrated by also Western Blot. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A typical North American diet provides approximately 50 to 60% of its caloric intake from carbohydrates. As carbohydrates are the main source of glucose and the primary source of energy for glucose stored tumor cells, reducing carbohydrates through dietary restrictions can assist in lowering glucose levels and hence limiting tumor cell access to this fuel source. Thus, one aspect of the disclosed invention pertains to methods of treating a proliferative disorder in a subject comprising the administration, to the subject, of a composition comprising one or more component(s) selected from: epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG); curcumin; glucosinolates and/or derivatives thereof, such as glucoraphanin and/or sulforaphane (SFN) (optionally in the form of broccoli sprouts, the sprouts of other cruciferous vegetables or cruciferous vegetables themselves) and, optionally, Daikon radish (in the form of mature radish, sprouts or powders of the radish, spouts or extracts therof) alone or in combination with a low carbohydrate diet. The components can be administered individually as separate compositions or in various combinations (e.g., pairs, threecomponent compositions or a single composition containg all four or five components). MCTs are fractionated from coconuts or palm kernel oils and are used clinically for patients with malabsorption symptoms. Due to their small molecular size MCT are digested rapidly traveling directly to the liver where they are quickly metabolized and lead to elevated blood ketones levels. Increased ketone and reduced glucose concentrations are the primary physiological effects of a ketogenic diet (for example, a diet composed of 90% fat and 10% proteins/carbohydrates). EGCG is the most abundant catechin found in green tea. Curcumin is derived from turmeric. Cruciferous vegetables contain a group of substances known as glucosinolates, which are sulfur-containing chemicals. During digestion, food preparation or chewing the glucosinolates are broken down into a number of biologically active compounds, these include, but are not limited to,: indoles, nitriles, thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, Indole-3-carbinol and sulforaphane [SFN], SFN is a bioactive molecule derived from the conversion of a glucosinolate precursor, glucoraphanin, found in cruciferous vegetables (for example, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, bok choy, kale, collards, Chinese broccoli, broccoli raab, kohlrabi, mustard, turnip, radish, arugula, and watercress). It is found in highest concentration in broccoli sprouts. Effective doses of glucosinolates, such as glucoraphanin and its biologically active breakdown products including SFN can be delivered by consumption of sprouts or sprout powders derived from the aforementioned cruciferous vegetables or plants from the genus Brassica. The phrases “composition(s) comprising glucosinolates and/or derivatives thereof, such as glucoraphanin and/or sulforaphane (SFN)” or “composition(s) comprising glucosinolates” or “composition(s) comprising glucoraphanin” or “composition(s) comprising SFN” may comprise one or more powders of mature plants of the genus Brassica or mature cruciferous vegetables, consumable vegetative matter of mature plants of the genus Brassica or mature cruciferous vegetables, dehydrated or non-dehydrated sprouts of plants of the genus Brassica or sprouts of cruciferous vegetables, or powdered sprouts obtained from cruciferous vegetables or from plants of the genus Brassica. In some embodiments, the composition(s) comprising glucosinolates and/or derivatives thereof, such as glucoraphanin and/or sulforaphane (SFN) comprise powders of mature plants of the genus Brassica or mature cruciferous vegetables, consumable vegetative matter of mature plants of the genus Brassica or mature cruciferous vegetables, powders formed from dehydrated or non-dehydrated sprouts of plants of the genus Brassica or sprouts of cruciferous vegetables, or powdered sprouts obtained from cruciferous vegetables or from plants of the genus Brassica. As discussed above, powders from one or more cruciferous vegetable or plants from the genus Brassica can be combined into a composition comprising glucosinolates and/or derivatives thereof, such as glucoraphanin and/or sulforaphane (SFN). The powders discussed above may be provided in the form of freeze-dried powders. The administration of such powders delivers glucosinolates, including glucoraphanin, a compound subsequently metabolized to SFN by myrosinase, to the subject being treated. Daikon radish can be combined in with the components discussed above into compositions. Where Daikon radish is formulated into a composition comprising the various components discussed herein, it can be provided in the form of a powder (optionally freeze-dried), sprout, mature vegetable or a sprout powder (including dehydrated and/or freeze-dried sprout powders). The current invention is directed to a treatment of proliferative disorders, for example, cancer. Thus, one aspect of the current invention provides a treatment of a proliferative disorder comprising administering to a subject in need of a treatment for the proliferative disease, a combination of compounds and, optionally, simultaneously providing the subject with a low carbohydrate diet or a modified ketogenic diet or a ketogenic diet. The combination of compounds to be administered to the subject comprise EGCG, curcumin, compositions comprising glucosinolates such as glucoraphanin and breakdown products such as SFN (these can be derived from broccoli sprouts or sprouts of other cruciferous vegetables or plants of the genus Brassica), and, optionally, Daikon radish sprout, a Daikon radish sprout extract or a powder of said extract, the Daikon radish or the Daikon radish sprout. These compounds (components) can be administered as a single composition or individually (as separate compositions/components) sequentially or simultaneously. This aspect of the invention can also provide for the restoration of normal cell proliferation for the proliferative disorder being treated. Thus, for various forms of cancer treated in this aspect of the invention, excessive cell proliferation associated with the proliferative disorder can be reduced or attenuated to levels at, or near normal proliferative levels for the particular cell giving rise to the proliferative disorder (e.g. a B-cell if B-cell lymphomas are being treated). Normal or near normal proliferative levels of cells are, generally, known in the art or can be dertermined by those skilled in the art. Thus, certain embodiments of the invention provide for reducing/attenuating the proliferation cells associated with a proliferative disorder by at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 95% or more. Various other aspects of the invention provide for the use of a composition comprising epigallocatechin-3-gallate, a composition comprising curcumin, and a composition comprising glucosinolates such as glucoraphanin and breakdown products such as SFN, and, optionally, a modified ketogenic diet or a ketogenic diet in subjects for the treatment of a proliferative disorder, decreasing the incidence of a proliferative disease in a subject, slowing the progression of a proliferative disease in a subject, increasing survival in a subject having a proliferative disease, enhancing the effect of conventional therapies for patients with proliferative diseases, sensitizing resistant cells to conventional therapies for patients with proliferative disease, reducing neuronal effects of chemotherapy in a subject treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen or reducing downregulation of neural stem cells (NSC) of the CNS in a subject developing a tumor or having a tumor or in a subject having a neurodegenerative disease or disorder. The compositions described above can be administered separately, separately in two, three or four component compositions or as a combined composition of all the components of the composition (including, optionally, Daikon radish sprouts, extracts thereof and/or powders thereof as described above). Slowing the progression of a proliferative disease in a subject relates to reducing the speed of a proliferative disease to advance overtime and can be measured, for example, as a reduction in increased volume of a tumor. Increasing survival in a subject having a proliferative disease relates to delaying the progression of proliferative diseases, in a subject and leads to an increased in the time of survival of a subject having a proliferative disease. Enhancing the effect of conventional therapies for patients with proliferative diseases relates to combining the disclosed method with conventional therapies used to treat subjects with proliferative diseases. This combination of therapies leads to positive outcomes equal to (additive effect) or greater than (synergistic effect) the individual effect of the conventional treatment and the disclosed method. Sensitizing resistant cells to conventional therapies for patients with proliferative disease relates to the ability of the disclosed method to convert proliferative diseases that were insensitive to conventional treatments used to treat patients with proliferative disease into proliferative diseases that respond to the conventional treatment to which the disease was, previously, unresponsive/refractory. Reducing neuronal effects of chemotherapy relates to reducing or preventing the decline of neural stem and progenitor cell activity observed when a subject undergoes chemotherapy. The modified ketogenic diet is a diet that contains at least 5% and no more than about 20% carbohydrates (as a function of total caloric intake by the intake by the subject each day) and the balance of the diet for the subject comprises fats and proteins. Thus, the diet can, as a function of total caloric intake each day, contain about 5% to about 20% carbohydrates, about 30% to about 75% fats and about 5% to about 65% proteins. In certain embodiments, the diet can provides between about 8% and about 15% carbohydrates, about 50% to about 70% fats and about 18% to about 42% proteins. In some embodiments, from about 30% to about 70% (e.g., about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60% or about 70%) of the fat content of the subject’s diet can be made up of medium chain triglycerides (MCT). Other embodiments provide that MCT make up about 50% of the fat content of the subject’s diet. As a function of total amount of food (grams) based on a daily intake of 2000 kilocalories (and based on the fact that lg of carbohydrates provides 4 kilocalories, lg of fat provides 9 kilocalories, lg of proteins provides 4 kilocalories and lg of MCTs provide 6.8 kilocalories) the modified ketogenic diet is a diet that contains at least 25g and no more than lOOg of carbohydrates and the balance of the diet for the subject comprises fats and proteins. Thus, the diet can, as a function of total grams intake each day, contain about 25g to lOOg of carbohydrates, about 67g to about 167g of fats and about 25g to about 325g of proteins. In certain embodiments, the diet can provides between about 40g and about 75g of cabohydrates, about 11 lg to about 155g of fats and about 90g to about 210g of proteins. In some embodiments, from about 30% to about 70% (e.g., about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60% or about 70%) of the fat content of the subject’s diet can be made up of medium chain triglycerides (MCT). This represents from about 40g to about 165g of MCTs. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a diet wherein the carbohydrate content is less than, or equal to, about 5% of the total caloric intake the subject each day and the balance of the diet consists of fats or proteins. Thus, the diet provides, as a function of total caloric intake each day, about 5% or less carbohydrate, about 30% to about 90% fat and about 5% to about 70% protein.

Following are examples, which illustrate procedures for practicing the invention. These examples should not be construed as limiting. All percentages are by weight or by calories and all solvent mixture proportions are by volume unless otherwise noted. EXAMPLE 1: The modified Ketogenic Diet [mKD] alters glucose and ketone levels to the same extent as the Ketogenic Diet [KD] NOD-SCID animals were placed on a KD or mKD or mKD+EDP for two weeks. The compositions of the diets are as follows (expressed as percentage of calories): Control diet: Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. KD: 92% Fat, 3% carbohydrate, 5% protein. mKD: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein. ΝΡ diet: 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat + Sulforaphane (SFN; 25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). Ten animals, in each dietary group, were placed on the modified diet for 2 weeks at which point tail tip method was used to collect blood via the following protocol: “Using a 50mL conical (or mouse restrainer) place a non-anesthetized mouse gently inside grasping the mouse by the tail. Place the mouse’s tail on a hard surface. Using a scalpel cut off less than 1mm of the tip of the tail. Place your fingers at the base of the tail and gently squeeze upward running your fingers from base to tip of the tail. One to two drops of blood (5-10μΤ) will appear at the tip of the tail. Using a dry gauze wipe away first few drops of blood and repeat steps until desired amount of blood is collected (should be dark, whole blood, clear [plasma like] blood will give you an inconsistent blood reading). Place the mouse back into the cage and monitor for excess bleeding.” Blood samples were analyzed with Precision Xtra blood glucose/ketone monitor and expressed in mg/dl and mmol for glucose and ketones, respectively. With regards to glucose levels, all 4 experimental diets resulted in a significant reduction in glucose [Figure 1, ρ < 0.001], Similarly, ketone levels were elevated in all the dietary groups except for the ΝΡ diet [Figure 2, ρ <0.001], These data demonstrate that the mKD and mKD/NP diet is able to mimic the two key physiological features of the KD, a significant reduction in glucose and a significant increase in ketones. EXAMPLE 2: The mKD/NP diet is safe and has no signs of toxicity The vast majority of cancer therapeutics has dose-limiting toxic side effects that impact not only a patient's well-being but it also results in suspended treatments and reduced dosages that can impact treatment efficacy. One of the best indicators of overall health in a rodent is its body weight [this is true in human patients as well], NOD-SCID animals received 1Μ GB cells [patient derived lines] into the right flank. Animals were monitored 3 times per week for signs of tumor formation. Once a tumor was identified [by palpation & approximately 65mm3]] animals were randomly assigned to 1 or 2 groups: [1] Control diet or [2] mKD/NP diet. Body weight was monitored 3 times per week. Figure 3 depicts percentage change in body weight till the first control animal reached endpoint [16 days]. While the mKD/NP group initially lost weight over the first few days [due to adjusting to a new diet], they quickly recovered the lost weight and continued to gain weight at a significantly greater rate than the control group [p<0.005, linear regression, GraphPad], When animals reached endpoint blood was collected via intracardiac or retro-orbital puncture and blood samples were sent to Comprehensive Clinical Pathology Services, LLC for the following analysis: [1] Alkaline phosphatase [ALP] - liver, bones and pancreas function test [2] Alanine transaminase [ALT] - liver function test [3] Aspartate animotransferase [AST] - liver function test [3] Creatinine - kidney function test Figure 4 reveals no statistically significant differences in liver, kidney, bones and pancreas function between the control and mKD/NP feed animals. Together, Figure 3 and 4, support the conclusion that mKD/NP diet is safe and has no noted toxic side effects. EXAMPLE 3: Comparison of safety between Standard of care [SOC] vs. mKD/NP The first line chemotherapy for high grade gliomas is temozolomide [TMZ], which is an oral alkylating agent that damages DNA and triggers cell death. While TMZ is an effective chemotherapy agent it also has significant toxicity. Using the same subcutaneous model as noted in example 2, at the time of tumor presentation animals were randomly assigned to one of three groups: [1] control diet, no treatment; [2] control diet, SOC [TMZ, 20 mg/kg three times/week]; [3] mKD/NP diet. We analyzed the number of animals that died as a result of non-tumor related causes and noted that SOC treatment resulted in an increase in mortality compared to the untreated controls [Figure 5], A similar increase in mortality was not seen in the mKD/NP group, where the death rate was not statistically different than the controls but was significantly lower than the SOC group. While receiving SOC treatment, body weight was measured and not surprisingly was significantly reduced in the SOC group relative to the control and mKD/NP treated animals [Figure 6], It is important to note that mKD/NP treatment was as effective as SOC [see example 11], Hence, these data teach that mKD/NP has no adverse effects on overall health [as defined by body weight] and does not directly affect mortality, unlike SOC that affects overall health and results in increased mortality. EXAMPLE 4: Natural products [NP] provide effective cancer treatment Patient derived hGB cells were cultured under defined conditions using established protocols that allow the tumor cells to retain both their phenotypic and genotypic properties in vitro. hGB cell lines were treated with the following NPs: [1] EGCG - 8 μΜ [2] Curcumin - 0.5 μΜ [3] SFN - 2.5 μΜ [4] a combination of all three NPs Each of the NPs resulted in a significant reduction in the overall number of cells that were produced relative to the control cultures [Figure 7], However, the simultaneous application of all three NPs resulted in a synergistic effect with regards to reducing the production of new cells. These data support the hypothesis that each of the NPs exert their effect by different mechanisms. One million hGB cells were implanted into the right flank of NOD-SCID mice, and at the time that a palpable tumor was identified the animals were randomized into one of 5 groups: [1] Control diet [2] Control diet + EGCG [1200mg/kg] [3] Control diet + Curcumin [1200mg/kg] [4] Control diet + SFN [25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%] [5] Control diet + EGCG/Curcumin/SFN [same concentrations as group 2-4] Animals were kept on their respective diets till tumors reached endpoint [1500 mm3] and they were killed. Kaplan Meier survival curves were generated using GraphPad. While groups 2-4 did not live longer than the control animals, those treated with all three natural products [Group 5] did live significantly longer [Figure 8], These data support the synergistic actions of combining the three NPs and their effect on reducing tumor progression and enhancing lifespan. Together the data teaches that our unique combination of NPs has an synergistic effect in vitro but a synergistic action in vivo, indicating that this particular combination produces an unexpected anti-cancer effect and as such is defined as a unique polymolecular botanical drug. EXAMPLE 5: Natural Products [NPs] target the proliferating tumor cells and cancer stem cells Patient derived hGB cells were cultured for 5-7 days in the presence of the following NPs: [1] EGCG - 8 μΜ; [2] curcumin - 0.5 μΜ; [3] Sulforaphane - 2.5 μΜ. Cells were then dissociated into a single cell suspension and plated at a low density in 96 well plates together with control nutrient growth medium [NeuroCult + EGF], At this stage cells were no longer exposed to NPs. After being cultured for 7-10 days in the 96 well plates, the number of spheres was counted [to determine the clonogenic frequency] and the spheres were sized [to determine the proliferative capacity of each clone forming cell]. Cells in 96-well plates were first fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution containing 0.2% Triton-X and 1:1000 dilution of DAPI. Fluorescent images were taken and the number of spheres and their size quantitated using Macnification. Data was exported to excel and statistical analysis done in GraphPad. Figure 9 details the results of this experiment and demonstrates the ability of our ΝΡ combination to reduce the pool of proliferating clone forming precursor cells and to reduce the proliferative ability of the clones. As cancer is a disease defined by the uncontrolled growth of clonogenic cancer cells, the ability of our NPs to reduce the number of clones and to reduce the proliferative potential of the existing clones points to the novelty and utility of our findings. In a second experiment [Figure 10], patient derived hGB cells were serially passed in culture while being treated with the following NPs: [1] EGCG - 8 μΜ [2] Curcumin - 0.5 μΜ [3] SFN - 2.5 μΜ [4] A combination of all three NPs Figure 10Α demonstrates the ability of each ΝΡ on its own to reduce the slope of the growth curve compared to the control cultures. The combination of all three NPs produced an unexpected synergistic effect. Applying an algorithm that we have recently developed and published on, the data derived from this serial passage experiment allows us to interrogate and measure the effect of treatment on the cancer stem cell population. When expressed as a Kll value [the probability of a cancer stem cell undergoing a symmetric cell division over a defined period of time] we can see that each of our NPs are able to target the expansion of the cancer stem cells. Strikingly, the combination of our three NPs has a statistically significant effect on reducing symmetric cancer stem cell divisions relative to the control or any of the NPs use on their own [Figure 10 B], Together these data demonstrate the ability of our ΝΡ combination to target and reduce the clonogenic population in a fairly aggressive solid tissue tumor and to be able to reduce the proliferative ability of the clones. It is important to note that the reduced proliferation was observed when the cells were no longer exposed to the NPs [Figure 9], This would suggest that a brief exposure to our NPs might have a lasting effect on tumor cell proliferation. In addition, the capability of our ΝΡ combination to target the cancer stem cell population is extremely important and relevant as it is this population, which is going to be responsible for therapeutic resistance and recurrence. EXAMPLE 6: Natural Products [NPs] work synergistically with conventional Standard of care [SOC] for many solid tissue cancers involves the use of chemotherapy, which for many advanced or high grade tumors provides marginal benefit. Patient derived hGB cells were grown in culture and treated daily with the conventional drug temozolomide [ΤΜΖ, 20μΜ] only or in combination with the following NPs: [1] EGCG - 8 μΜ [2] Curcumin - 0.5 μΜ [3] SFN- 2.5 μΜ [4] a combination of all three NPs After 5-7 days in culture cells were counted and the mean daily fold expansion calculated. While SOC drug ΤΜΖ had a statistically significant effect on reducing the expansion of the tumor cells the addition of EGCG or SFN enhanced this effect, with SFN demonstrating the greatest effect. However, the combination of all three NPs, together with ΤΜΖ, had the greatest effect with there being a statistically significant reduction compared to all groups. These results demonstrate that our unique ΝΡ combination is capable of enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of SOC ΤΜΖ by 8 fold. EXAMPLE 7: The modified Ketogenic Diet [mKD] is safe, nutritionally sufficient and as effective as the Ketogenic Diet [KD] as a cancer treatment NOD-SCID animals were placed on one of the following diets: [1] Control diet: Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] KD: 92% Fat, 3% carbohydrate, 5% protein. [3] mKD: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein. Body weight was measured 24 days after treatment began and while the KD group exhibited a significant decrease in body weight, the mKD treated animals maintained their body weight relative to the control diet animals [Figure 12], This supports the notion that the mKD is nutritionally sufficient to support normal health. Following inoculation of 1Μ GB tumor cells into the right flank of NOD-SCID mice animals were randomized and put on one of the three diets. Tumor progression was followed by recording 2 measurements of tumor diameter and converting this into a volume using the following formula: (4/3)π1ℓ3. For spheroid tumors the two measurements were averaged to determine the diameter of the sphere. In the case of ellipsoid tumors (i.e. prolate or oblate spheroid mass) the formula used was: (4/3)π * (d/2) * (d/2)2. In this case the second measurement “d2” would count twice and “d” only once. For prolate spheroids, the long measurement occurs once while the short measurement occurs twice. Conversely, for the oblate spheroid tumors, the long measurement occurs twice while the short one occurs only once. Following this criteria, tumor volume was tracked over time. Figure 13 illustrates that the KD and mKD resulting in a significant delay in tumor progression compared to the control group. No difference was seen between the KD and mKD fed animals. Overall survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curve [GraphPad], and both the mKD and KD feed animals lived significantly longer than controls [Figure 14], Similar to tumor progression, there was no significant difference between the mKD and KD groups. Lastly, we compared the time to tumor progression [defined as the time it took for a palpable tumor to reach a size that was visible - 300 mm3], in this case there were a statistically significant reduction in the time to tumor progression in both the KD and mKD group [Figure 15]. No difference was seen between the KD and mKD feed animals. Figure 16 depicts the mean survival of our three treatment groups. Mean survival was significantly enhanced in both the KD and mKD fed animals, with no differences seen between these two groups. Overall, these data support our conclusion that our mKD is nutritionally sufficient with no adverse effects on overall health and like the KD is an effective cancer treatment that delays tumor progression and enhances overall survival. EXAMPLE 8: Combining the mKD and NPs enhances the therapeutic effect on GB cell proliferation and targeting of the cancer stem cell population in vitro Patient derived hGB cell lines were exposed to either the mKD, NPs or both for 5-7 days in culture after which total cell number was determined and compared to control cultures. The mKD was mimicked in vitro by reducing glucose levels to those found in patients who are on a KD [65-80 mg/dl] and elevating ketones to 4mM [hydroxybutyrate, Sigma], The three natural products that were added were: [1] EGCG - 8 μΜ [2] Curcumin - 0.5 μΜ [3] SFN - 2.5 μΜ Under these conditions there was a significant reduction in the number of cells that were generated over the 5-7 day in both the mKD and ΝΡ treated cultures. The most significant reduction however was seen when the mKD was used together with NPs [Figure 17]. In a separate experiment we examined the effects of each treatment [mKD, NPs, and combination] on the number of proliferating or clonogenic cells. Cultured hGB cells were treated with one of our three treatment conditions for seven days in vitro, after which cultures were washed, dissociated into a single cell suspension and we plated in control medium so as to assess the effects of treatment on the number of sphere forming cells [or clonogenic frequency]. The number of spheres was enumerated 7 to 10 days later. Figure 18 demonstrates that while the mKD and the NPs treatments resulted in an approximate 50% reduction in the number of sphere forming cells [which was not significant due to a high variability] there was a statistically significant reduction in the mKD/NP treated cultures [90%]. Cancer stem cells are thought to contribute to therapy resistance and be responsible for driving long term tumor growth, targeting this population is widely believed to be essential for the development of successful cancer therapeutics. Using a previously published algorithm that is able to enumerate symmetric cancer stem cell divisions, data was collected by serially passage of patient derived hGB cells in one of our four treatment conditions [control, mKD, ΝΡ or mKD/NP], Our data indicates that each of the treatment conditions resulted in a significant reduction in the frequency of symmetric cancer stem cell divisions relative to the control. The greatest effect was seen in the combination treatment of mKD/NP [Figure 19], Together the experiments in this example demonstrate that the combination of a mKD and our NPs exhibit the greatest effect at reducing overall proliferation, reducing the number of proliferating clonogenic cells and targeting the cancer stem cell population by reducing the number of symmetric stem cell divisions within this important subpopulation of GB tumor cells. EXAMPLE 9: Combining mKD and NPs reduces tumor progression, increases overall survival compared to mKD or NPs alone NOD-SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ patient derived hGB cells. Once a palpable tumor was identified [2 to 4 weeks later], animals were randomized into 1 of 4 groups: [1] Control diet : Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] mKD: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein. [3] ΝΡ diet: 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). [4] mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). Tumor were measured 3 times per week, volume calculated and progression tracked, presented and statistical comparison made in GraphPad [using non-linear regression, 2-way ANOVA], Figure 20 illustrates tumor progression for these four treatment groups and demonstrates a significant reduction in tumor progression for all treatment groups relative to control. The combination of mKD/NP demonstrated the most significant reduction compared to any of the treatment groups. When animals reached the endpoint, [tumors greater than 1500 mm3], they were killed and Kaplan-Meier plot was used to analyze survival [GraphPad], Figure 21 reveals that all treatment groups survived significantly longer than the controls, with the mKD/NP treated animals demonstrating statistically significant increase in survival compared to mKD and ΝΡ treated animals. The mean survival is depicted in Figure 22 and further demonstrates the superiority of mKD/NP in increasing survival. The combination of the two treatments also resulted in a statistically significant increase in progression free survival as determined by the time it took a palpable tumor to reach a volume of 300mm3 [Figure 23], Together these data demonstrate the advantage of combining two novel and effective therapeutic protocols [mKD and NPs] to produce an unexpected synergistic effect delaying tumor progression and increasing mean and maximum lifespan. EXAMPLE 10: The mKD/NP diet increases lifespan in an orthotopic xenograft model of GB NOD-SCID mice received an intracranial injection of 200Κ hGB cells into the right striatum. Three days after initial surgery animals were randomized into one of two groups: [1] Control diet : Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). Animals were closely monitored for any signs of disease or distress and when they began to exhibit abnormal neurological signs [lethargy, paralysis, seizure or abnormal motor behavior] animals were killed. Kaplan-Meier plots indicate that the mKD/NP group survived significantly longer than the control fed animals [Figure 24], The mean survival was calculated for both groups and Figure 25 reveals a significant increase in mean survival for the mKD/NP fed animals. These data strongly support the efficacy of using our combination mKD/NP treatment in an orthotopic xenograft cancer model. EXAMPLE 11: mKD/NP treatment performs as well as standard of care chemotherapy for GB The standard of care [SOC] for patients with high-grade gliomas such as GB involves the use of the chemotherapy drug Temozolomide [TMZ], While ΤΜΖ demonstrates some degree of effectiveness for GB patients, the increase in survival is marginal [about 2-3 months] and the negative side effects are significant [nausea, vomiting and hematological toxicity]. Hence, there exists a need for less toxic but effective treatments. NOD-SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ patient derived hGB cells. Once a palpable tumor was identified [approximately 2-3 weeks post implant], animals were randomized into 1 of 3 groups: [1] Control diet : Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] Standard of Care: Control diet together with daily TMZ injections [5mg/kg], [3] mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). Tumors were measured 3 times per week, volume calculated and progression tracked, presented and statistical comparison made in GraphPad [using non-linear regression, two-way ANOVA], Figure 26 demonstrates that the mKD/NP diet is able to reduce tumor progression to the same extent as SOC. Relative to the control animals both SOC and mKD/NP resulted in a significant increase in progression free survival as measured by the time they took a palpable tumor to reach 300mm3 [Figure 27], Together these data indicate that the mKD/NP therapeutic is as effective as SOC chemotherapy in delaying tumor progression and enhancing progression free survival. EXAMPLE 12: mKD/NP is an effective adjunct treatment when used together with standard of care for GB NOD-SCID animals received an injection of 1Μ patient derived hGB cells into the right flank. Once a palpable tumor was identified animals were randomized into 1 of 4 treatment groups: [1] Control diet: Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] Standard of Care: Control diet together with daily ΤΜΖ injections [5mg/kg], [3] mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). [4] SOC + mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg), together with daily ΤΜΖ injections [5mg/kg], Tumor volume was measured 3 times per week, recorded and analyzed using GraphPad software. Figure 28 depicts tumor growth over time and indicates that mKD/NP performs as well as SOC; however, the combination of mKD/NP together with SOC demonstrates a further reduction in tumor progression. When TMZ-resistant hGB cells were used as the donor cells implanted into the NOD-SCID mice, SOC had no effect on tumor progression. However, mKD/NP was an effective treatment that was enhanced by combining mKD/NP and SOC [Figure 29], In summary, the experiments in this example demonstrate the efficiency of mKD/NP treatment and that the efficacy can be enhanced by combining with SOC. Unexpectedly, SOC resistant tumors are not only responsive to mKD/NP but addition of mKD/NP with ΤΜΖ sensitizes the tumor cells to previous ineffective SOC therapy. As virtually all patients with stage IV cancers will develop resistance to their SOC chemotherapy, the ability to sensitize the tumor to SOC therapy with a safe and low toxicity adjunct treatment is of tremendous value for the cancer care community. EXAMPLE 13: mKD/NP as a preventative treatment There are currently nearly 14 million people living with cancer in the USA alone, a number that is expected to rise to 18Μ in the next 10 years. Developing treatments that prevent or delay initial development of cancer or recurrence will have a significant effect on not only the personal impact of the cancer but a tremendous economic influence as well. Towards this end we have tested the ability of the mKD/NP treatment as a preventive treatment and to delay tumor onset. NOD-SCID animals were placed on one of two diets: [1] Control diet: Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). After being on the diets for two months animals received a subcutaneous injection of 1Μ patient derived hGB cells into the right flank. Animals were monitored daily for the initial appearance of a palpable tumor [approximately 65mm3], Figure 30 indicates that animals on the mKD/NP diet had a significant delay in the time to first appearance of a tumor [approximately 300%]. Of greater interest was the 60% reduction in the numbers of animals that developed tumors [Figure 31]. Using a similar paradigm, animals were placed on the control or mKD/NP diet for two weeks prior to being inoculated with 2Μ lung carcinoma cells [A549] in the right flank of NOD-SCID animals. 21 days after tumor implantation approximately 90% of the control animals had developed a palpable tumor, in contrast, only 50% of the animals on the mKD/NP diet had a palpable tumor [Figure 32], Together these data demonstrate the efficacy of the mKD/NP diet in not only delaying the onset of a discernible tumor but also its ability to reduce the occurrence of tumor and hence have a preventive effect. EXAMPLE 14: mKD/NP attenuates the effects of a peripheral tumor on central nervous system stem cell proliferation and ΝΡ is able to enhance in vitro the pool of neural stem cells NOD-SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ cells in the right flank. Once a discernible tumor was palpated, animals were randomized into one of two groups: [1] Control diet: Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg; BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). When tumors reached end point, animals received three injections of BrdU [50mg/kg] over a 72-hour time period. Animals were killed, brains removed, fixed, sectioned and BrdU antibodies used to identify cells that were in S-phase during the 72 hour injection period. The number of BrdU-immunoreactive cells were enumerate in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Figure 33Α reveals that relative to normals [non-tumor bearing animals], peripheral tumors caused a dramatic and significant reduction in the number of proliferating cells. However, in animals treated with mKD/NP diet there was a striking increase in the number of proliferating dentate gyrus stem cells. These data indicate that the mKD/NP treatment is able to protect the endogenous neural stem cells from the negative effects of a tumor located outside of the CNS. Given the growing body of literature demonstrating cognitive impairment in cancer patients, this data supports the use of the mKD/NP diet for maintaining normal brain function and memory. When somatic human neural stem cells (hNSCs) were cultured in vitro using the Neurosphere Assay and treated with each of the individual natural products ([1] EGCG - 8 μΜ, 2] Curcumin - 0.5 μΜ or [3] SFN - 2.5 μΜ) or the combination of all three, each natural product on its own did not show any effect on the viability of hNSCs (analyzed using the standard ΜΤΤ assay). However, the combination of all three natural products exhibited a significantly increased viability [Figure 33Β]. Together these data support the notion that mKD/NP and ΝΡ represent unique combinations able to efficiently enhance and maintain the pool of somatic neural stem cells both in vitro and in vivo. EXAMPLE 15: Optimization of the mKD/NP diet To improve the effectiveness of the mKD/NP diet we investigated the addition of Daikon Radish Sprout Powder [DRSP], NOD-SCID animals were inoculated with 1Μ patient derived GB cells and once a palpable tumor was identified animals were randomized into 1 or 3 groups: [1] Control diet : Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] mKD/NP.OOl: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP100%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). [3] mKD/NP.002: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). Tumor volume was measured three times per week using calipers. Figure 34 demonstrates that mKD/NP.002 had a significant effect on reducing tumor progression relative to the control [p<0.001] and was statistically significantly better than mKD/NP.001 [p<0.05]. Similarly, the time for a palpable tumor to reach a volume of 300 mm3 was significantly delayed in the mKD/NP.002 fed animals in comparison to mKD/NP.OOl group [Figure 35], Importantly, mean survival was enhanced in the mKD/NP.002 treated animals relative to mKD/NP.OOl group [Figure 36, p<0.05]. Once animals had reached end point the tumors were surgically excised and dissociated into a single cell suspension so they could be analyzed by using flow cytometry. The cells were fixed [4% PFA] and processed for immunohistochemistry using an antibody that identified the cell proliferation antigen Ki67 and pSTAT3 (pathway activated in GB that is a number one driver of uncontrolled proliferation). Figure 37Α illustrates a significant reduction in the percentage of cells that are actively dividing in the mKD/NP.002 group compared to mKD/NP.OOl [p<0.05] and control [p<0.01]. Similarly, there was a marked reduction in the percentage of GB cells with activated STAT3 signaling as evidenced by the reduction in the number of pSTAT3 immunoreactive cells [Figure 37Β]. EXAMPLE 16: mKD/NP Treatment is an effective therapy for colon cancer Using a colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line [HT-29], 2Μ cells were implanted into the right flank of NOD/SCID animals. Once a palpable tumor was noted, animals were randomly assigned to one of two groups: [1] Control diet: Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). Tumors were measured 3 times/week and animals sacrificed once the tumors reach endpoint [1000 mm3]. Tumor volume was measured over time and Figure 38 indicates a significant reduction in tumor progression for the mKD/NP treated animals. The effects of mKD/NP on delaying tumor progression are further reflected in Figure 39 where tumor volume was compared between the control and the treated group 30 days after tumor inoculation. In this case there was a significant reduction in the mean tumor volume [student's t-test, p<0.01]. Importantly, Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that the mKD/NP treated animals survive significantly longer than the controls [Figure 40, p<0.01, Log rank test], which was also reflected in the meantime to reach endpoint [Figure 41], When colon cancer cells were treated in vitro with each of the individual natural products, or the combination of all three, each natural product on its own exhibited a significant reduction in the number of cells that were generated. However, the combination of all three natural products demonstrated the largest reduction in cell numbers. Together these data support the notion that mKD/NP and ΝΡ are able to reduce the proliferation of colon cancer both in vitro and in vivo. EXAMPLE 17: mKD/NP Treatment is an effective therapy for lung cancer Using a lung carcinoma cells (Α549), 2Μ cells were implanted into the right flank of NOD/SCID animals. Once a palpable tumor was noted, animals were randomly assigned to one of two groups: [1] Control diet: Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). Tumors were measured 3 times/week and animals sacrificed once the tumors reach endpoint [1000 mm3]. Tumor volume was measured over time and Figure 43 demonstrates a significant reduction in tumor progression for the mKD/NP treated animals [p<0.001]. The effects of mKD/NP on delaying tumor progression are further reflected in Figure 44 where tumor volume was compared between the control and the treated group 31 days after treatment initiation. In this case there was a significant reduction in the mean tumor volume [student's t-test, p<0.05]. The progression free survival of the tumors was determined by measuring the time it took tumors to go from a palpable stage to a size of 300 mm3. In this case the progression free survival was significantly delayed in the mKD/NP group [Figure 45], Importantly, Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that the mKD/NP treated animals survive significantly longer than the controls [Figure 46, p<0.05, Log rank test], which was also reflected in the meantime to reach endpoint [Figure 47], When colon cancer cells were treated in vitro with each of the individual natural products, or the combination of all three, each natural product on its own exhibited a significant reduction in the number of cells that were generated. However, the combination all three natural products demonstrated the greatest reduction in cell numbers [Figure 48], Together these data support the notion that mKD/NP and ΝΡ are able to reduce the proliferation of colon cancer both in vitro and in vivo and that this unique combination is an effective cancer treatment. EXAMPLE 18: mKD/NP Treatment is an effective therapy for breast cancer Human breast cancer cells [ZR751] grown in culture and treated daily with physiological concentrations of either EGCG (8 μΜ), Curcumin (0.5 μΜ) or SFN (2.5 μΜ) or used in combination (ΝΡ). Once the control cultures had reached confluency, cell numbers were determined using the standard ΜΤΤ Assay. Figure 49 reveals that each of the NPs on their own had no statistically significant effect on reducing the number of breast cancer cells, however, the combination of all three NPs reduced the number of cells by nearly 40%. Next 2Μ ZR751 breast cancer cells were implanted into the flank of a NOD/SCID mouse and host animals randomized into 1 of 2 groups once a detectable tumor could be palpated: [1] Control diet: Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). Tumors are measured 3 times per week using calipers and tumor volume is calculated using the following procedure. Tumor progression was followed by recording 2 measurements of tumor diameter and converting this into a volume using the following formula: (4/3)π1ℓ3. For spheroid tumors the two measurements were averaged to determine the diameter of the sphere. In the case of ellipsoid tumors (i.e. prolate or oblate spheroid mass) the formula used was: (4/3)π * (d/2) * (ά/2)2. In this case the second measurement “d2” would count twice and “d” only once. For prolate spheroids, the long measurement occurs once while the short measurement occurs twice. Conversely, for the oblate spheroid tumors, the long measurement occurs twice while the short one occurs only once. Following these criteria, tumor volume was tracked over time. Figure 50 depicts the progression of the tumor over time until the animals reached endpoint [1000 mm3] and reveals that the mKD/NP diet results in a significant reduction in overall tumor progression [p<0.0001, two-way ANOVA], The ability of mKD/NP to effectively reduce tumor progression is also reflected in comparing the mean size of the breast tumors at 70 and 145 days post treatment initiation. In this case, as depicted in Figure 51 and 52, there is an approximate 50% reduction in tumor size at day 70 [p<0.01, student t-test] and a similar reduction at Day 145, respectively. Progression free survival was determined by calculating the time it took the tumors to grow from a barely palpable stage [approximately 65 mm3] to a tumor of significant size [visually identifiable, 300 mm3]. In this case, the mKD/NP diet produced an approximate 20% increase in progression free survival [Figure 53, p<0.01, students t-test]. Importantly, comparison of the survival curves [Kaplan-Meier] between the two groups indicate that the mKD/NP diet resulted in a statistically significant increase in survival [Figure 53, p<0.01, log rank test]. Together these data demonstrate the effectiveness of mKD/NP at treating an aggressive and deadly form of breast cancer. EXAMPLE 19: Mechanisms of mKD/NP: Cell death, cancer stem cells and DNA damage Using patient derived GB cells that were expended in culture, 1Μ were implanted into the right flank of NOD/SCID animals. Once a palpable tumor was identified animals were randomized to one of two treatment groups: [1] Control diet: Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). Tumors were monitored 3 times per week and animals sacrificed when they reached endpoint [1500 mm3]. Tumors were harvested and prepared [fixed and labeled with DAPI] for identification of the SubGl population, which is representative of the apoptotic subpopulation. The percentage of cells undergoing cell death is significantly increased in the mKD/NP treated animals [Figure 55, p<0.001, student t-test], CD 133 is a prospective marker for GB cancer stem cells where an increase in their frequency is indicative of a more aggressive or more difficult to treat tumor. Development of therapies that are able to target this population and reduce the frequency of CD 133 positive cells or cancer stem cells are thought to be a critical component in the development of more effective therapeutics. Using the paradigm details in this example, we probed the control and mKD/NP treated tumors with a CD 133 specific antibody so as to calculate the overall percentage of CD 133-positive cancer stem cells. Figure 56 depicts the results from one particular experiment where we noted a 60% reduction in the size of the CD 133-positive cancer stem cell population. It was also noted, Figure 57,in the mKD/NP treated animals that the CD 133-positive cancer stem cells contained notable double-stranded DNA breaks approximately 3 times than the control treated animals [this was determined using an antibody that marks the phosphorylated form of Η2ΑΧ, which is positively correlated to the amount of DNA double-stranded breaks]. Together these data demonstrate the ability of mKD/NP to not only increase the incidence of apoptotic cell death but to importantly target GB cancer stem cells by increasing the amount of DNA damage in this particular and clinically relevant subpopulation. EXAMPLE 20: mKD/NP targets known drivers of tumor proliferation and mechanisms that afford resistance to conventional treatments Using cell lines that were derived from patient tumors and cultured in serum free media, 1Μ GB cells were implanted into the right flank of NOD/SCID animals. Once a palpable tumor was identified animals were randomized to one of two treatment groups: [1] Control diet: Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). Tumor volume was monitored 3 times per week using calipers and animals were sacrificed when they reached endpoint [1500 mm3], tumors excised and cells processed for immunohistochemistry and identification of intracellular pathway activation. Analysis was performed using flow cytometry. Figure 58 summarizes the effects of mKD/NP on the expression [Figure 58A] and activation [Figure 58B] of Y-box binding protein 1 [YB1], a protein that is implicated in the maintenance and proliferation of tumor cells [including brain and breast tumors]. The data in Figure 58 demonstrates a significant reduction in overall ΥΒ1 expression and in the number of cells that demonstrate phosphorylation, and hence activation, of ΥΒ1 [Figure 58 A and Β, respectively]. Within this same experimental series we also assessed the CD 133+ cancer stem cell population and levels of the anti-apoptotic effector NFkB [Figure 59] and noted a marked reduction of over 80% in the percentage of cancer stem cells that were expressing NFkB. This demonstrates the ability of mKD/NP to target the anti-apoptotic mechanisms that cancer stem cells use to survive conventional treatments. In summary, the data from these experiments demonstrate that mKD/NP targets known drivers of tumor proliferation and anti-apoptotic mechanisms and together provide a better mechanistic understanding of the target[s] of mKD/NP. EXAMPLE 21: mKD/NP attenuates chemotherapy induced upregulation of proteins that contribute to treatment resistance Patient derived GB cells were cultured in the NeuroSphere Assay [using defined culture conditions]. The cells were treated daily for 4 of their seven days in culture with one of the following: [1] Control [2] ΤΜΖ [10 μΜ] [3] ΝΡ combination [EGCG (8 μΜ), Curcumin (0.5 μΜ) and sulforaphane (2.5 μΜ)] [4] ΤΜΖ [10 μΜ] & ΝΡ combination [EGCG (8 μΜ), Curcumin (0.5 μΜ) and sulforaphane (2.5 μΜ)] After seven days in culture cells were harvested, fixed with 4% PFA, processed for immunocytochemistry and analyzed by flow cytometry. Figure 60 depicts the increase in MGMT levels in cells that are treated with ΤΜΖ [approximately 30%] and the attenuation of this increase [less than 10% of the control levels] when the ΤΜΖ treated cultures were also treated with the ΝΡ combination. Figure 61 depicts the changes in overall survivin expression [a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis for which the overexpression is associated with chemoresistance] within the population and the number of survivin expressing cells. While ΤΜΖ resulted in a statistically significant increase in the overall expression of survivin and in the number of cells that expressed it, the addition of ΝΡ returned the levels back to those that were comparable to control. Interestingly, ΝΡ on its own did not affect the expression of survivin compared to the control cells. Following inoculation of 1Μ GB cells into the right flank of NON/SCID animals, and their randomization into one of two treatment groups, animals were treated with one of two diets: [1] Control diet: Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). When animals reached endpoint they were sacrificed, tumors removed, dissociated into a single cell suspension, fixed in 4% PFA and analyzed by flow cytometry for MGMT or pSTAT3 expression. Figure 62 summarized the results of this experiment and teaches that MGMT [Figure 61A] and pSTAT3 [Figure 61B] levels markedly reduced when treated with mKD/NP relative to controls. As both elevated MGMT and pSTAT are mechanism correlated and known to increase resistance to chemotherapy, mKD/NP demonstrates a promising approach to decrease the expression levels of these proteins and sensitize cells to chemotherapy. In summary, the experiments in this example provide a mechanism for our observed reduction in tumor progression, increased survival and enhanced response to chemotherapy. EXAMPLE 22: Mechanism for mKD/NP therapeutic effect on reducing tumor progression and enhancing survival Figures 63-66 illustrates a number of mechanisms that mKD/NP diet can influence to reduce tumor progression and increase life span. Following inoculation of 1Μ GB cells into the right flank of NON/SCID animals, and randomization into one of two treatment groups, animals were treated with one of two diets: [1] Control diet: Is a standard mouse chow and is composed of 55% carbohydrate, 30% protein, 15% fat. [2] mKD/NP: 10% carbohydrate, 60% Fat (half coming from medium chain triglycerides [MCT, Neobee 598]), 30% Protein + SFN (25mg/kg;BSP95%/DRSP5%), Curcumin (1200mg/kg), EGCG (1200mg/kg). When tumors reached endpoint the animals were sacrificed, tumors removed, dissociated into a single cell suspension, fixed in 4% PFA and analyzed by flow cytometry [Figures 63, 64, 65 & 66], immunohistochemisty [Figure 66B] and western blots [Figure 66D], Together, these data illustrate that mKD/NP diet is able to reduce the expression of many of the drivers of tumor progression including ΖΕΒ1 [Figure 63], mTOR [Figure 66], those that enhance survival such as NFkB [Figure 64], mKD/NP diet is also able to target a key protein involved in glucose metabolism that is upregulated in GB and that plays a key role in providing glucose, and hence fuel, to actively proliferating GB cells [Figure 65], These data support the broad effect that mKD/NP has on tumor cells and its ability to simultaneously target multiple mechanisms that play a role in altering the primary drivers of tumor progression but also the escape mechanisms that are responsible for inherent and acquired tumor resistance.
