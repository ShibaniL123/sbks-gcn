?ï!!: This invention is an attachment strip adapted, for example, to facilitate the attachment of pictures, posters and the like to walls, windows, etc., and for various other and sundry purposes where it may be desirable to adhesively mount one object on another. The invention is particularly useful for attaching ornamental edgings to shelving in closets, pantries and the like to thereby eliminate the necessity of using tacks,thumb tacks or other metal attaching means which tend to detract from the appearance of the edging and are dangerous if they fall inço dishes, cooking pots or pans and are undetected when food is introduced therein. The present invention utilizes a sticker tape of cloth, paper or the like and both of the opposite faces of which are coated with an adhesive, preferably of the pressure type adapted te adhere to any article with which it is brought into contact under pressure. Many adhaaives of this kind are commonly known tothe public and a detailed description thereof is unnecessary, it being considered that the generic term ,,pressure adhesive" will cover any appropriate adhesive of this character. In the preTerred manner of practically carrying out this invention, I provide a relatively narrow sticker tape of the character described and enclose this tape within a protec. tive envelope of parer, fabric or any other suitable material This envelope is formed by folding or doubling a relatively wide web of such material upon itself to form two leaves of unequal width. The tape is positioned between the leaves and adhesively attaches itself to both of them in a position remote from the fold and in spaced relation to the free longitudinal edges of said leaves, whereby the margins of the il! f « 71 rb, ,,,ì, 0 leaves are left unattached to permit them to be grasped with} out bringing the fingers into contact with the adhesive. I ! i then transversely slit the assembly from the free edges of I i the leaves to points beyond the sticker tape but short of the! fold, so as to sever the sticker tape into predetermined lengths and divide it into a series of alined sections. By slitting or otherwise transversely weakening the assembly as described, successive longitudinal sections thereof may be conveniently torn off and used in a manner hereinafter explained in detail. One or both faces of the assembly may be printed or otherwise delineated for advertising purposes. Features of the invention, as well as other ways in which the same may be carried out, will be hereinafter more fully described in the following detailed description. The accompanying drawings illustrate different practical embodimentsof the invention, but the constructions therein shown areto be understood as illustrative, only, andnot as defining the limits of the invention. Figures l, 2 and 3 are perspective views showing i successive steps in making an adhesive strip embodying the present invention. Figure % shows one of the units separated from the finished strip and partially stripped to render it ready for use. Figure 5 is a perspective view showing the manner of employing the present invention in attaching a shelf edging to shelf. Figure 6 is a fragmental perspective showing a modified form of the invention. I i tion. Figures 7 and 8 show modified forms of the invenFigure 9 shows a detachable unit of the structure of Figure 8. Figure l0 shows a shelf with dual sticker tape sections according to Figures 8 or 9. Referring first to Figures 1-5 of the drawings, 1 indicates a sticker tape of any suitable material, such as fabric, paper, or any other suitable body material, both faces of which are coated with a pressure adhesive. This sticker tape is fed into contact with a web 2 of paper, fabrie, parchment or any other suitable and readily tearable sheet material insuch manner that the tape becomes adhesive-' ly secured thereto in parallel but spaced relation to the edge 3 of the web. The web is thereupon folded over or doubled upon itself along the line and the thus folded leaf is brought into face abutting relation with the tape 1 and becomes adhesively secured thereto. The two leaves of the web are preferably of unequal width so that the edge 5 projects beyond the edge 3 te permit these edges to be more readily separate After the parts have been assembled as stated, the assembly is slit or otherwise weakened as by longitudinally spaced apart cuts 6, extending from the free edges 3 and 5 to point beyond the remote edge of the tape l, so as to sever aid tape and an appreciable portion of the width of the pro- ective strip. Either before or after slitting one or both of ;he:exterior faces of the leaves of the protective web may be »tinted with appropriate advertising matter. «'i J i, OE « Ç -," ;.J / » The protective web 2 should be made of material which will satisfactorily adhere to the sticker tape with sufficient tenacity to maintain the assembly until it is desired to strip the web from the tape, but to then permit of the ready separation of these parts. Furthermore, when the assembly is slit as stated, the material utilized in the protective strip should be such that it may be readily torn, by virtue of which it is possible to tear off successive units as indicated at in Figure 3. The assembly thus embodies a succession of these units, united beyond the ends of the slits 6 along the fold edge, and these various units may be successively torn off for consecutiVe use. Themanner of employing the units will be apparent! I from Figures 4 and 5. In Figure % one of the units is shown as removed from the assembly with one edge portion of one of the protective leaves partially stripped or removed from the sticker tape section. By continuing to strip said leaf from the sticker tape section, one adhesive face of the latter will be exposed or uncovered and may be conveniently brought in adhesive engagement with the front edge of a shelf as shown at the le£t in Figure 5. After being thus engaged with a shelf, the other leaf of the protective web is stripped from the adhesive sticker tape section, as shown at the center in Figure 5, and may thus be removed, leaving the sticker tape section 1 in place on the front edge of the shelf. After an appropriate number of these sections of the sticker tape have been attached to the shelf as stated, a length of shelf edging, indicated at may be applied to the shelf by pressing it against the tape sections l, whereby it is held in place on the shelf without the use of tacks or other metal fastening means. OE,çi: ;'ï " . , , .. , :- '" ;.«:.. : ki{ ', J i % i In the foregoing description of the preferred form ii of the invention, the sticker tape 1 is made continuous and J ì separated by the slits 6 into readi].y separable sections. In i! the construction of Figure 6, however, a plurality of alined separated sections 7 of sticker tape are positioned between the leaves of a protective web with lines of perforations S to permit consecutive units to be torn off. If the sticker tape is readily tearable or separable, the sections 9 may be made continuous in the structure of Figure 6 and the perforations may pass therethrough to facilitate the simultaneous tearing of both the tape and the protective web. These and other modifications of the invention will be readily apparent te those skilled in the art and are within the present inven- .... tion. In the structures whìch I have thus far described, the protective web is folded upon itself or doubled to provide two leaves which enclose between them a single sticker tape or row of sticker tape sections. The present invention is preferably made in either of these ways because of convenience in manufacture. However, instead of employing a single sticker tape a plurality of such tapes may De used and they may be each made relatively wide or relatively narrow depend- ing upon conditlens. Thus in Figure 7 the prëtectìve web 2 is made as heretofore, but between the leaves of said web are i two parallel sticker tapes la and lb, the assembly being transversely weakened by slits 6 as hereinbefore descrìbed. The article shownln Figure 7 is employed in the same manner as the structure shown in the previous figures, except that when applied to a shelf g, as shown in Figure lO, a pair of or dual sticker tapesections la and lb are simultaneously applied to the shelf in spaced apart relation. I find this arrangement highly satisfactory for attaching paper such i shelf paper or shelf edging to a shelf because the dual attachment permits the paper to readily adapt itself without strain or stress and even though the paper may be inadvertent ly stripped free from one of the sticker tape sections, the other will still tightly hold the paper in place. In the structure of Figure 8, the sticker tapes are shown as positioned substantially midway between the edges of the assembly and this is preferred when the separate protective sheets are employed, and even when a single sticker tape is used. However, I do not limit the invention in this connection for, if desired, one or more sticker tapes can be located anywhere transversely of the protective sheets and one of said tapes may be positioned directly adjacent to or at one longitudinal edge of one or both of said sheets, so long as two ±ongitudinal adjacent edges of such sheets extend beyond an adjacent sticker tape to permit these sheets to be readily stripped from the tape or tapes without the fingers of the hand coming in contact with the adhesive on said tapes. The invention is to oe understood as sufficiently comprehensive to include these features. Moreovër, instead of making the protective covering of the sticker tape sections in the form of a folded web, I may employ separate webs, such as shown in Figure 8, these webs being here designated as 2a and 2b and they may be staggered er not as desired and may be employed to enclose either a single sticker tape or a plurality of such tapes. In any event, the assembly is transversely weakened by slits 6 or otherwise, so as to permit the units to be torn off for use as desired. Figure 9 shows one of the units torn from the assembly of Figure 8 with one of the protective sheets partially stripped free. In use the structure of Figures 8 and 9 :iiii i results in the application of dual sticker tape sections as li illustrated in Figure lO. i I wish it understood that these modified forms of the invention may be made in any suitable materials adapted for the purposes hereinbefore described. It should be noted that the sticker tape is coated preferably throughout its entire extent with an adhesive matf erial and that the leaves of the protective web are provided I J t with extending free edges which permit them to be readily I I grasped and removed from the tape so that at no time need the fingers of the operator touch said tape, as will be apparent from the foregoing description. The structure is economical to manufacture. It may be made in indetérminate lengths by automatic machinery and cut off in pieces appropriate to-the requirements of the trade. It is thoroughly efficient inuse and the independent imite when separated are of convenient size to be readily handled and yet provide satisfactory adhesive anchorage for a wide field of usage. The foregoing specification sets forth the invention in its preferred practical forms, but the invention is to be understaòd as fully! commeñs'urate withthe appended claims. S ?: i ii !
