WO 2011/128403 PCT/EP2011/055906 Organic Compound for use in the treatment of liver cancer The invention relates to the use of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3- [6-(4-methylpiperazin1 -yl)- 1H-benzimidazol-2yl]-lH-quinolin-2-one, or a tautomer thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a hydrate thereof or a solvate thereof for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions for use in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer (HCC) or liver cancer, to the use of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6- (4-methylpiperazin1-yl)- 1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]- 1H-quinolin-2-one in the treatment of hepatocellular cancer or liver cancer. Management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver cancer is a major problem. HCC development and progression is highly dependent on angiogenesis. VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and their receptors are associated with HCC neovascularization. Overexpression of FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) has been described in HCC. Currently there are limited treatment options for advanced HCC patients. Until now there is only one treatment approved for HCC, namely sorafenib. The patients and physicians are thus clearly lacking alternative treatments, especially for patients that have unresectable HCC, that are not eligible for surgery, that are not eligible for locoregional surgery or that faced disease progression after surgery. Said patients are in such a situation that they do no longer have alternative therapies. Despite the merits of sorafenib, the median overall survival for the patients does not extend beyond a year. The median overall survival from the 1st line sorafenib treatment in patients with unresectable HCC was 10.7 months (Llovet et al, N Engl J Med; 2008, 359: 378-390), and even shorter in HCC patients of AsiaPacific region with a median overall survival of 6.5 months (Cheng et al, 2009, Lancet Oncol 10: 2534). There is no effective approved treatment for advanced HCC patients who have progressed on sorafenib treatment. Based on published data, it is assumed that the median overall survival is around months in HCC patients who have progressed on or after sorafenib treatment as second line treatment, e.g. after surgery. Moreover, there is a need to monitor and manage, when possible, side effects associated with this treatment, such as for example hypertension and hand-foot syndrome (HFS) or hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR). There is thus an unmet medical need for better systemic therapy for this patient population exhibiting a high mortality and morbidity. WO 2011/128403 PCT/EP2011/055906 It has now been found that 4-amino-5-fluoro-3- [6-(4-methylpiperazin1 -yl)- 1H-benzimidazol-2-yl]- 1Hquinolin-2-one or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a hydrate or a solvate can solve theses problems, as it efficiently reduced tumor volume in animal models for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or liver cancer and thus provides a new treatment option for HCC or liver cancer. Said treatment is advantageous as it allows to bringing further treatment option to a category of patients that were previously lacking treatment or lacking such treatment options. For example some patient might not have been able to undergo treatment with the current approved therapy, e.g. sorafenib, because of underlying conditions that render said treatment not appropriate for the patient, such as patient having HCC refractory to the approved drug, or non responsive to said drug, and/or patients that are intolerant or that would face some side effects such as hypertensive patients, patients developing hand-foot syndrome (HFS) or hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) over another medicine, e.g. with sorafenib treatment. 4-Amino-5-fluoro-3 - [6-(4-methylpiperazin1 -yl)- 1H-benzimidazol-2-yl] - 1H-quinolin-2-one or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a hydrate or a solvate has the structure shown in Formula I: H H, f"" N a H H The compound of Formula I inhibits various protein kinases, such as tyrosine receptor kinases (RTKs). Consequently, the compound of Formula I and its salts are useful for inhibiting angiogenesis and treating proliferative diseases, e.g. hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer. Preparation of this compound and its salts, including the mono-lactic acid salt, are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,605,617, 6,774,237, 7,335,774, and 7,470,709, and in U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 10/982,757, 10/982,543, and 10/706,328, and in the published PCT applications WO 2006/127926 and WO2009/115562, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The mono-lactate salt of the compound of Formula I exist in a variety of polymorphs, including, e.g., the monohydrate form and the anhydrous form. Polymorphs occur where the same composition of WO 2011/128403 PCT/EP2011/055906 matter (including its hydrates and solvates) crystallizes in a different lattice arrangement resulting in different thermodynamic and physical properties specific to the particular crystalline form. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane polypeptides that regulate developmental cell growth and differentiation, remodeling and regeneration of adult tissues. Polypeptide ligands known as growth factors or cytokines, are known to activate RTKs. Signaling RTKs involves ligand binding and a shift in conformation in the external domain of the receptor resulting in its dimerization. Binding of the ligand to the RTK results in receptor trans-phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues and subsequent activation of the catalytic domains for the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic substrates. The compound of formula I inhibits tyrosine kinases. The tyrosine kinase may be but not limited to Cdc2 kinase (cell division cycle 2 kinase), Fyn (FYN oncogene kinase related to SRC, FGR, YES), Lck (lymphocyte-specific proetein tyrosine kinase), c-Kit (stem cell factor receptor or mast cell growth factor receptor), p60src (tyrosine kinase originally identified as the v-src oncogene of the rous sarcoma viurs), c-ABL (tyrosine kinase that stands for an oncogene product originally isolated from the Adelson leukemia virus), VEGFR3, PDGFRa (platelet derived growth factor receptor a), PDGFR[3 (platelet derived growth factor receptor [3), FGFR3 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3), FLT-3 (fms-like tyrosine kinase-3), or Tie-2 (tyrosine kinase with lg and EGF homology domains). In some embodiments, the tyrosine kinase is Cdc2 kinase, Fyn, Lck, or Tie-2 and in some other embodiments, the tyrosine kinase is c-Kit, c-ABL, p60src, VEGFR3, PDGFRa, PDGFR[3, FGFR3, or FLT-3. Two subfamilies of RTKs are specific to the vascular endothelium. These include the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) subfamily and the Tie receptor subfamily. Class III RTKs include vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR-3). The present invention provides the use of 4-amino-5-fluoro-3-[6-(4-methylpiperazin-l-yl)-lHbenzimidazol-2-yl]-1H-quinolin-2-one or a tautomer thereof, or a mixture thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a hydrate or a solvate for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions for use in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma or liver cancer, for example advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, Barcelona HCC Stage C, for example in HCC patients that have hypertension, in HCC patients that have developed or develop hand-foot syndrome or a hand-foot skin reaction, e.g. under another treatment, e.g. under sorafenib treatment, in patient that have unresectable HCC, in patients, that are not eligible for surgery, that are not eligible for locoregional surgery or that faced disease progression, e.g. after any of the former mentioned treatment, or patient that are intolerant or resistant WO 2011/128403 PCT/EP2011/055906 to another HCC or liver cancer therapy, e.g. patients having an HCC resistant to sorafenib, or patient having an HCC not responding to sorafenib or patient that are intolerant to sorafenib. Indeed side effects associated with a therapeutic treatment raise patients discomfort and some patients can even be reluctant to take the treatment. When there is a Hand-Foot syndrome for example, chemotherapy treatment may need to be interrupted or the dose adjusted, e.g. lowered, to prevent the worsening of the hand-foot syndrome, resulting in the HHC condition of the patient not being longer adequately controlled. On top of this the side-effects requires additional costs to monitor and manage them.

Following is a description by way of examples. Example 1 : HUH-7 tumors are established by subcutaneous injection of 5x106 cells in 100 gl Hank's Balanced Sait Solution (HBSS) from Sigma containing 50% Basement Membrance Matrix (BD Matrigel) into the right flank of nude mice. The parental HUH-7 hepatoma cell line is initially derived from a maie human liver carcinoma. HUH-7 cells are cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Calf Serum, 5% horse serum, 1% L-glutamine and 1% Penecyllin/Streptavidin. Cell culture reagents are purchased from BioConcept (Allschwil, Switzerland). 12 days after the injection of tumor cells the tumor volumes are 138 424 mm3. At this time (day 1 of the study) the treatment with Compound I starts. Animais are euthanized after 21 days of consecutive daily treatments 24h after the last compound administration. Body weights and tumor volumes are recorded three times a week. Tumor volumes are measured with calipers and determined according to the formula length x width x hight x 7t / 6. In addition to presenting changes of tumor volumes over the course of treatments, antitumor activity is expressed as AT/AC % (mean change of tumor volume of treated animals/mean change of tumor volume of control animais) x Compound I is formulated by dispersing the compound in water and vortexed until a clear solution is obtained. Compound is applied daily by oral gavage at the concentration of 10, 30 and 50 mg/kg, free base equivalents. Each group contains 8 animals. Vehicle-treated animals receive a daily oral administration of water. The application volumes in all experiments were 10 ml/kg. WO 2011/128403 PCT/EP2011/055906 Where applicable, data are presented as mean + SEM. For ail tests, the level of significance is set at p < 0.05. For the mean increase in tumor size, comparisons between groups and vehicle control group are done using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. The level of significance of body weight change within a group between the start and the end of the experiment is determined using a paired ttest. The significance of body weight changes between the treatment group and the vehicle control group is determined with a one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. Calculations are performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0(GraphPad Software Inc.). Figure 1/4 shows the dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth, which was statistically significant at and 50 mg/kg, with % T/C of 75, 40 and 20 respectively. The treatment with these doses of the compound was well tolerated as indicated by an increase in body weight over the course of treatment which was similar for the vehicle treated as well as the compound treated groups of animals (Figure Example 2 : PLC/PFR/5 tumors are established by subcutaneous injection of 5x106 cells in 100 gl Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) from Sigma containing 50% Basement Membrance Matrix (BD Matrigel) into the fight flank of female nude mice.
