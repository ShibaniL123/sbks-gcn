DETAILED DESCRIPTION Cognitive decline, such as memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, personality changes, disorientation, and loss of language skills occurs in much of the population as they age, in varying degree. The most common, severe and irreversible form of cognitive decline is Alzheimer’s disease, which, at present, is always fatal. The symptoms of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease are thought to stem from the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, which are thought to contribute to the degradation of the neurons (nerve cells) in the brain and the subsequent onset of symptoms. Amyloid is a general term for protein fragments that the body produces normally. Beta-amyloid is a fragment of a protein that is snipped from another protein called amyloid precursor protein (ΑΡΡ). In a healthy brain, beta-amyloid protein fragments are broken down and eliminated. In individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other forms of cognitive decline, the fragments accumulate to form hard, insoluble plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are insoluble twisted fibers that are found inside of the brain's cells. The protein contained in neurofibrillary tangles, i.e., the tau protein, forms a microtubule, which helps transport nutrients and other important substances from one part of the nerve cell to another. In Alzheimer's disease the tau protein is abnormal and the microtubule structures collapse. Beta-secretase is the enzyme in the human brain responsible for the production of Beta-amyloid, the pathogenic substance responsible for the formation of brain plaques and tangles in the Alzheimer’s diseased brain. Beta-amyloid and its oligomers (beta-amyloid oligomers or Abeta oligomers) are also believed to be responsible for early cognitive decline in the pre-Alzheimer’s diseased brain. Inhibition of beta-secretase would be expected to lessen beta-amyloid burden in the brain and thus slow cognitive decline, block the formation of amyloid oligomers, the production of plaques and tangles, halt neurodegeneration, and to potentially treat mild cognitive impairment and more serious forms of cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer’s disease. The gingerols are a series of natural small molecules isolated from ginger, Zingiber officinale, and are classified according to their alkyl chain length e.g., [6]-gingerol, [8]gingerol. Gingerols are known to be relatively unstable under both chemical and biological conditions, forming inactive substances. For example, the beta-hydroxycarbonyl function of the gingerols is vulnerable to oxidation or dehydration to form inactive products, and the gingerols are particularly prone to rapid dehydration under acidic conditions, such that even the pure substance is difficult to store for long periods. Accordingly, simple oral dosing of the gingerols for medicinal action might not be possible due to the acidic environment of the stomach and upper intestinal tract. Further, chemical and biological instability is also likely to be a serious problem for intravenous doses. Accordingly, there is strong need to discover inhibitors of cognitive decline, and in particular, compounds that are useful in the treatment and abatement of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease, by methods such as inhibiting amyloid (including Abeta oligomers) production, amyloid (including Abeta oligomers) aggregation, and/or amyloid (including Abeta oligomers) deposition (/.℮., plaqing), inhibiting neuorodegeneration, and/or restoring long term potentiation, and/or inhibiting the activity/effect of Abeta oligomers on neurons. There is also a need for inhibitors of cognitive decline that are chemically and biologically stable. Plants have attracted relatively little attention as potentially valuable resources for drug discovery in the area of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. The use of plant extracts to produce unnatural derivatives of compounds of medicinal interest is not generally used. Accordingly, there is also a need for a method of producing compounds of medicinal interest from plant extracts and extracts from other biological sources. In particular, there is also a need to produce and identify compounds derived from plant extracts that are useful in the treatment and abatement of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. The compounds, compositions, and methods described herein are directed toward these needs and other ends.

A “substituted” atom or moiety indicates that any hydrogen on the designated atom or moiety can be replaced with a selection from the indicated substituent group, provided that the normal valency of the designated atom or moiety is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. For example, if a methyl group (i.e., CH3) is optionally substituted, then 3 hydrogen atoms on the carbon atom can be replaced with substituent groups. As used herein, “about” in connection with a numerical value means that the numerical value is approximate and small variations would not significantly affect the practice of the disclosed embodiments. Where a numerical limitation is used, unless indicated otherwise by the context, “about” means the numerical value can vary by ±10% and remain within the scope of the disclosed embodiments. The compounds described in the embodiments herein can be asymmetric (e.g., having one or more stereocenters). All stereoisomers, such as enantiomers and diastereomers, are intended unless otherwise indicated. Compounds of the present invention that contain asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Methods on how to prepare optically active forms from optically active starting materials are known in the art, such as by resolution of racemic mixtures or by stereoselective synthesis. Many geometric isomers of olefins, C=N double bonds, and the like can also be present in the compounds described herein, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis and trans geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. Where a compound capable of stereoisomerism or geometric isomerism is designated in its structure or name without reference to specific R/S or cis/trans configurations, it is intended that all such isomers are contemplated. Resolution of racemic mixtures of compounds can be carried out by any of numerous methods known in the art. An example method includes fractional recrystallizaion using a chiral resolving acid which is an optically active, salt-forming organic acid. Suitable resolving agents for fractional recrystallization methods are, for example, optically active acids, such as the D and L forms of tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, lactic acid or the various optically active camphorsulfonic acids such as βcamphorsulfonic acid. Other resolving agents suitable for fractional crystallization methods include stereoisomerically pure forms of a-methylbenzylamine (e.g., Sand Rforms, or diastereomerically pure forms), 2-phenylglycinol, norephedrine, ephedrine, Νmethylephedrine, cyclohexylethylamine, 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, and the like. Resolution of racemic mixtures can also be carried out by elution on a column packed with an optically active resolving agent {e.g., dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine). Suitable elution solvent composition can be determined by one skilled in the art. Compounds of embodiments the invention also include tautomeric forms. Tautomeric forms result from the swapping of a single bond with an adjacent double bond together with the concomitant migration of a proton. Tautomeric forms include prototropic tautomers which are isomeric protonation states having the same empirical formula and total charge. Example prototropic tautomers include ketone - enol pairs, amide - imidic acid pairs, lactam - lactim pairs, amide - imidic acid pairs, enamine - imine pairs, and annular forms where a proton can occupy two or more positions of a heterocyclic system, for example, 1Η- and 3Ηimidazole, 1 Η-, 2Η- and 4Η-1,2,4-triazole, 1Η- and 2Η- isoindole, and 1Η- and 2H-pyrazole. Tautomeric forms can be in equilibrium or sterically locked into one form by appropriate substitution. Compounds of embodiments the invention further include hydrates and solvates, as well as anhydrous and non-solvated forms. The term, “compound,” as used herein is meant to include all stereoisomers, geometric iosomers, tautomers, and isotopes of the structures depicted. All compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be prepared or present together with other substances such as water and solvents (e.g. hydrates and solvates) or can be isolated. Compounds of embodiments the invention can also include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the intermediates or final compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. In some embodiments, the compounds of the invention, or salts thereof, are substantially isolated. By “substantially isolated” is meant that the compound is at least partially or substantially separated from the environment in which is formed or detected. Partial separation can include, for example, a composition enriched in the compound of the invention. Substantial separation can include compositions containing at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 97%, or at least about 99% by weight of the compound of the invention, or salt thereof. Methods for isolating compounds and their salts are routine in the art. Compounds of embodiments the invention are intended to include compounds with stable structures. As used herein, “stable compound” and “stable structure” are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. The expressions, “ambient temperature” and “room temperature,” as used herein, are understood in the art, and refer generally to a temperature, e.g. a reaction temperature, that is about the temperature of the room in which the reaction is carried out, for example, a temperature from about 20 QC to about 30 QC. Embodiments of the present invention also includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein. As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by converting an existing acid or base moiety to its salt form. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention include the conventional non-toxic salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile (ACN) are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985, ρ. 1418 and Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66, 2 (1977), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Synthesis Compounds of embodiments the invention, including salts thereof, can be prepared using known organic synthesis techniques and can be synthesized according to any of numerous possible synthetic routes. The reactions for preparing compounds of the invention can be carried out in suitable solvents which can be readily selected by one of skill in the art of organic synthesis. Suitable solvents can be substantially non-reactive with the starting materials (reactants), the intermediates, or products at the temperatures at which the reactions are carried out, e.g., temperatures which can range from the solvent's freezing temperature to the solvent's boiling temperature. A given reaction can be carried out in one solvent or a mixture of more than one solvent. Depending on the particular reaction step, suitable solvents for a particular reaction step can be selected by the skilled artisan. Preparation of compounds of the invention can involve the protection and deprotection of various chemical groups. The need for protection and deprotection, and the selection of appropriate protecting groups, can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. The chemistry of protecting groups can be found, for example, in Τ. W. Greene and Ρ. G. Μ. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York (1999), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Reactions can be monitored according to any suitable method known in the art. For example, product formation can be monitored by spectroscopic means, such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (e.g., 1H or 13C), infrared spectroscopy, spectrophotometry {e.g., UV-visible), mass spectrometry, or by chromatographic methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or thin layer chromatography (TLC). The compounds of embodiments of the invention can be prepared, for example, according to the reaction pathways, synthetic procedures, and techniques described below. As shown in Scheme 1, benzaldehyde derivative 1-1 can be reacted with acetaldehyde in the presence of either an acid or a base catalyst to afford cinnamic aldehyde 1-2. Reaction of cinnamic aldehyde 1-2 with an organometallic compound such as a Grignard reagent R8MgX1 [wherein X1 is halo such as Cl or Br], followed by oxidation of the intermediate alcohol to ketone and by reduction of the C=C bond to a C-C single bond under a hydrogenation condition (for example, in the presence of Pd/C catalyst), affords ketone 1-3. Reaction of ketone 1-3 with amine 1-4 under reductive amination condition (such as in the presence of a borohydride reducing reagent) affords compound 1-5. As shown in Scheme 2, Ketone 2-1 can be reacted with an organometallic compound such as a Grignard reagent R7MgX2 [wherein R7can be alkyl or C3-7cycloalkyl; and X2 can be halo such as Cl or Br] to afford alcohol 2-2a. Reduction of Ketone 2-1 such as in the presence of a borohydride reducing reagent affords alcohol 2-2b. The OH group of alcohol 2-2 (wherein R7can be Η, C^e alkyl, or C3-7 cycloalkyl) can be converted to a better leaving group Lg1 such as OMs [mesylate or CH3S(0)20-] or OTf [triflate or CF3S(0)20-], followed by reaction with NH3 to afford amine 2-4. Ketone 2-1 can also undergo reductive amination with NH3 to afford amine 2-5. As shown in Scheme 4, benzaldehyde derivative 4-1 can be reacted with a methylmetalic compound such as a Grignard reagent MeMgX1 [wherein X1 is halo such as Cl or Br], followed by oxidation of the intermediate alcohol to ketone to afford ketone 4-2. Ester compound 4-3 [wherein Ft’ can be alkyl (e.g. methyl or ethyl) or arylalkyl; and Pg1 can be an amine protecting group (such as tert-butyloxycarbonyl or Boc; benzyloxycarbonyl or Cbz; or benzyl)] can be reduced to an alcohol (in the presence of a reducing reagent such as Lithium aluminium hydride or LAH), followed by conversion of the OH group to a better leaving group Lg3 such as OMs [mesylate or CH3S(0)20-] or OTf [triflate or CF3S(0)20-], to afford compound 4-4. Reaction of compound 4-2 with compound 4-4 in the presence of a strong base (such as lithium diisopropylamide or LDA), followed by hydrogenation (such as in the presence of a Pd/C catalyst) to reduce the C(O) to CH2 and by removal of the protecting group Pg1 under suitable conditions (for example, a benzyl group can be removed under hydrogenation condition in the presence of Pd/C; or Boc group can be removed under acidic condition), affords amine 4-5. Amine 4-5 can be reacted with compound 4-6 [wherein Lg2 can be a leaving group such as triflate group (-OTf) or halo (e.g. Cl or Br)] to afford compound 4-7. Those skilled in the art can recognize that in all of the schemes described herein, if there are functional (reactive) groups present on a substituent group such as R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, R16, etc., further modification can be made if appropriate and/or desired. For example, a CN group can be hydrolyzed to afford an amide group; a carboxylic acid can be converted to an amide; a carboxylic acid can be converted to an ester, which in turn can be reduced to an alcohol, which in turn can be further modified. For another example, an OH group can be converted into a better leaving group such as mesylate, which in turn is suitable for nucleophilic substitution, such as by CN. For another example, an -S- can be oxidized to -S(O)- and/or -S(0)2-. For yet another example, unsaturated bond such as C=C or 0≡0 can be reduced to saturated bond by hydrogenation. In some embodiments, a primary amine or a secondary amine moiety (present on a substituent group such as R1 - R16, etc.) can be converted to amide, sulfonamide, urea, or thiourea moiety by reacting it with an appropriate reagent such as an acid chloride, a sulfonyl chloride, an isocyanate, or a thioisocyanate compound. Thus, a compound of Formula I (such as compound 3-3 of Scheme 3) having a substituent which contains a functional group can be converted to another compound of Formula I having a different substituent group. As used herein, the term “reacting” refers to the bringing together of designated chemical reactants such that a chemical transformation takes place generating a compound different from any initially introduced into the system. Reacting can take place in the presence or absence of solvent. Chemical Conditioning In some embodiments, a method of preparing an array of chemical compounds from a biological extract such as ginger oil is provided. The method of the invention, termed “chemical conditioning” is generally applicable to all biological extracts, in particular, natural plant extracts, common or medicinal. See e.g. US20080193574 and W02008042755, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Chemical conditioning is a method which produces novel unnatural drug-like compounds from readily available natural materials. In general, the “chemical conditioning” of natural extracts coupled with pre-fractionation of the chemically conditioned extracts facilitates successful biochemical screening of extracts by destroying reactive natural compounds that generate false positive results in biochemical assays. Chemical conditioning produces novel lead-like and drug-like compounds and, the reductive amination protocol described here can produce structurally diverse nitrogen-containing products that are particularly lead-like and drug-like. In certain embodiments of the present invention, a method of preparing chemical compounds from a biological extract is exemplified in Scheme 5a below. According to the method, first, a biological extract, e.g., a plant extract is provided, the biological extract has one or more biological compounds, each biological compound having one or more reactive electrophilic groups. Next, the biological compounds in the biological extract are reacted with an amine to incorporate the amine into the biological compounds. Next, the biological compounds having the incorporated amine are reacted with a reducing agent to reduce the intermediate imine and enamine compounds and form one or more nitrogen-containing chemical compounds. Thus, the resultant nitrogen-containing chemical compounds are derivatives of the biological compounds in the biological extract. In some embodiments, the biological compounds in the biological extract are compounds having ketones and aldehydes that are reacted with various amines. This reaction is followed by hydride reduction of the intermediate imines and enamines to provide secondary and tertiary amines. The reaction of ketones and aldehydes with amines, followed by reduction to form imines and enamines is known in the art. biological exactract having a reactive electrophilic group imine and enamine "conditioned extracts" containing intermediates lead-like and drug-likecompounds R' and R" represent a variety of substituents that make up a biological compound; and R* represents a variety of substituent(s) that, together with the nitrogen, make up an amine compound. The chemical conditioning method described herein employs a biological extract, using many different reagents, to efficiently produce an array of nitrogen-containing chemical compounds. The ready commercial availability of many low molecular weight amines for use as inputs in the reductive amination sequence enables the development of many different and structurally diverse central nervous system druglike mixtures from the same natural extract. Suitable amines for use in the present method are selected from the group consisting of primary amines, secondary amines, cyclic amines, pyrollidine, and amino acids. Suitable reducing agents for use in the present method are selected from the group of hydride reducing agents including but not limited to sodium borohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, and lithium aluminum hydride. The method may further comprise quenching the reaction a quenching agent, wherein the quenching agent is selected from but not limited to the group consisting of sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate, sodium sulfate decahydrate. The method may also further comprise isolating one or more of the nitrogen-containing chemical compounds, in a purified or unpurified form. The resultant nitrogen-containing chemical may then be screened or tested for biological activity. The process of chemical conditioning by reductive amination described herein destroys reactive electrophiles in the natural extract, including ketones, as in the gingerols, and converts them to chemically stable compounds such as amines. The resulting conditioned extracts contain both natural compounds and novel unnatural nitrogen-containing amine products that are potential drug candidates. In the case of the extracts of gingerol, the nitrogen-containing amine products are potential central nervous system drugs. For the purpose of this disclosure, the following terms have the following meanings. The term “biological compound” as used herein refers to a chemical compound that occurs in nature. The term “biological extract” as used herein refers to an extract from a biological sample, such as a plant extract, or other extract from organic matter, containing chemical compounds that occur in nature.

Scheme 5 shows the two-step reductive amination chemical conditioning protocol performed on ginger oil and ginger oleoresin in accordance with one embodiment of the method, wherein ginger oil or gingerol comprising ketone 5-1 are converted to amine 5-4. According to the method shown in Scheme 5, ginger oil (an extract of ginger containing ketone 5-1 and other molecules occurring in natural ginger) is reacted with amine 5-2 to form compound 5-3. Then, the resultant compound 5-3 is then reduced, with a reducing agent such as a borohydride, to from the nitrogen-containing compound 5-4 (the reaction crude product also include other chemical compounds). "conditioned extracts" nitrogen-containing compounds In the next step of the method, amine 5-4 is isolated/purified from the extract (the crude reaction product of the 2-step reductive amination). The conditioned extracts can be fractionated by flash chromatography. The fraction that contains amine 5-4 can undergo further purification/isolation according to the methods known to those in the art. Further isolation and characterization of the fraction that contains amine 5-4 may follow. The isolated amine 5-4 is tested for its biological activity such as by those methods described hereinwith.

The one or more additional pharmaceutical agents can be administered to a patient simultaneously or sequentially. Pharmaceutical Formulations and Dosage Forms In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention can be administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art, and can be administered by a variety of routes, depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including transdermal, epidermal, ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including intranasal, vaginal and rectal delivery), pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal or intranasal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal intramuscular or injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. Parenteral administration can be in the form of a single bolus dose, or may be, for example, by a continuous perfusion pump. Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the like may also be useful. Embodiments of this invention also include pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the active ingredient, one or more of the compounds of the invention above in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (excipients). In making the compositions of the invention, the active ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier in the form of, for example, a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders. In preparing a formulation, the active compound can be milled to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size can be adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g. about 40 mesh. The compounds of the invention may be milled using known milling procedures such as wet milling to obtain a particle size appropriate for tablet formation and for other formulation types. Finely divided (nano particulate) preparations of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by processes known in the art, for example see International Patent Application No. WO 2002/000196. Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art. The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about 1000 mg (1 g), more usually about 100 to about 500 mg, of the active ingredient. The term "unit dosage forms" refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient. The active compound can be effective over a wide dosage range and can be generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. For example, the dosage of the active compounds of the invention as employed for the treatment of a patient in need thereof (such as an adult human) may range from 0.1 to 3000 mg per day, depending on the route and frequency of administration. Such a dosage corresponds to 0.001 to 50 mg/kg per day. In some embodiments, the dosage of the active compounds of the invention as employed for the treatment of a patient in need thereof (such as an adult human) may range from 1 to 2000 mg per day, from 1 to 1000 mg per day, from 10 to 1000 mg per day, or from 10 to 500 mg per day. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician, according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient can be mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid pre-formulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these pre-formulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid pre-formulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for example, about 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills of the present invention can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate. The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the present invention can be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be attached to a face masks tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally or nasally from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner. The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like. The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts. The therapeutic dosage of the compounds of the present invention can vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example, the compounds of the invention can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for parenteral administration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 g/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from doseresponse curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. The compositions of the invention can further include one or more additional pharmaceutical agents such as a chemotherapeutic, steroid, anti-inflammatory compound, or immunosuppressant, examples of which are listed hereinabove. Labeled Compounds and Assay Methods Another aspect of the present invention relates to labeled compounds of the invention (radio-labeled, fluorescent-labeled, etc.) that would be useful not only in radio-imaging but also in assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for localizing and quantitating the enzyme in tissue samples, including human, and for identifying ligands by inhibition binding of a labeled compound. Accordingly, the present invention includes enzyme assays that contain such labeled compounds. Embodiments of the present invention further includes isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention. An “isotopically” or “radio-labeled” compound is a compound of the invention where one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e., naturally occurring). Suitable radionuclides that may be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to 2H (also written as D for deuterium), 3H (also written as Τ for tritium), 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 15N, 150,170,180,18F, 35S, 36CI, 82Br, 75Br, 76Br, 77Br, 1231,124|, 125| and 1311. The radionuclide that is incorporated in the radio-labeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that radio-labeled compound. For example, for in vitro 1 Ar\ 82 1251 131 i 35 receptor labeling and competition assays, compounds that incorporate H, C, Br, I or will generally be most useful. For radio-imaging applications C, F, I, I, I, I, Br, 76Br or 77Br will generally be most useful. It is understood that a “radio-labeled compound” is a compound that has incorporated at least one radionuclide. In some embodiments the radionuclide is selected from 3H, 14C, 125l , 35S and 82Br. In some embodiments, the labeled compounds of the present invention contain a fluorescent label. Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes and fluorescent labels into organic compounds are well known in the art. A labeled compound of the invention (radio-labeled, fluorescent-labeled, etc.) can be used in a screening assay to identify/evaluate compounds. For example, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) which is labeled can be evaluated for its ability to bind a beta-secretase or a neuron cell (or a neuron cell in the presence of one or more of beta-amyloid oligomers) by monitoring its concentration variation when contacting with the beta-secretase or the neuron cell (or the neuron cell in the presence of one or more of beta-amyloid oligomers), through tracking the labeling. For another example, a test compound (labeled) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of another compound which is known to bind to beta-secretase or neuron cell (i.e., standard compound). Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the standard compound for binding to the beta-secretase or the neuron cell directly correlates to its binding affinity. Conversely, in some other screening assays, the standard compound is labeled and test compounds are unlabeled. Accordingly, the concentration of the labeled standard compound is monitored in order to evaluate the competition between the standard compound and the test compound, and the relative binding affinity of the test compound is thus ascertained. Kits Embodiments of the present invention also includes pharmaceutical kits useful, for example, in the treatment or prevention of cognitive decline and/or Alzheimer’s disease which include one or more containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Such kits can further include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as, for example, containers with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered, guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components, can also be included in the kit. The invention will be described in greater detail by way of specific examples. The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of non-critical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results. Certain compounds of the Examples were found to be inhibit, treat, or abate one or more of amyloid production, amyloid assembly, the activity/effect of Abeta oligomers on neurons (such as neurons in the brain), amyloid aggregation, amyloid oligomer binding, and amyloid deposition according to one or more of the assays provided herein.

At this time the Dean-Stark trap was removed and the reaction mixture was cooled to 0°C on an ice bath. A solution of sodium borohydride (5 g) in methanol (100 ml_) was added portion-wise over 30 minutes with vigorous stirring. When the addition was complete the mixture was heated at reflux for 16 hours. At this time the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured into saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (300 ml_). The resulting mixture was concentrated by rotary evaporation and the aqueous residue was partitioned between water and chloroform. The chloroform layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and then filtered and concentrated. The product was then purified using silica gel column chromatography employing a mobile phase of 5% ammonia-methanol in chloroform. Product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated then dried under high vacuum overnight to provide a light brown oil (6.16 g, 75% ). 1Η NMR, 13C NMR, and Mass Spectrum of the product were substantially the same as those in Example 1, A (made by the Conditioned Extraction method). Example 2 A. Conditioned Extraction of Ginger Oil: Reaction of ginger oil with 4-trifluoromethylbenzylamine followed by reduction with sodium borohydride in methanol and by fractioning using column chromatography Ginger oil (10 g) was dissolved in toluene (250 ml_) and 4-trifluoromethylbenzylamine (3.5 g) was added. The mixture was maintained under an atmosphere of nitrogen and heated at reflux with removal of water by Dean-Stark distillation for 16 hours. At this time the Dean-Stark trap was removed and the reaction mixture was cooled to 0°C on an ice bath. A solution of sodium borohydride (10 g) in methanol (100 ml_) was added portion-wise over 30 minutes with vigorous stirring. When the addition was complete the mixture was heated to reflux for 16 hours. At this time the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured into saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (300 ml_). The resulting mixture was concentrated by rotary evaporation and the aqueous residue was partitioned between water and chloroform. The chloroform layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and then filtered and concentrated. The products were then fractionated using silica gel column chromatography employing a gradient from 100% chloroform to chlorofomrmethanol (5:1). The product was detected in the relatively polar fractions by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated then dried under high vacuum overnight to provide a light brown oil (0.761 g). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCI3) δ: 7.57 (d, J= 7.8 Hz, 2Η), 7.43 (d, J= 7.9 Hz, 2Η), 6.82 (d, J = 7.3 Hz, 1Η), 6.65 (m, 2Η), 5.16-4.42 (br s, 2Η), 3.90 (d, J = 13.7 Hz, 1 Η), 3.84 (s, 3Η), 3.80 (d, J = 13.7 Hz, 1 Η), 2.76-2.70 (m, 1 Η), 2.67-2.55 (m, 2Η), 1.84-1.77 (m, 1 Η), 1.69-1.63 (m, 1 Η), 1.17 (d, J = 6.3 Hz, 3Η). 13C NMR (125 MHz, CDCI3) δ: 146.7, 144.6, 143.9, 134.0, 129.1, 128.4, 127.5, 125.4, 125.3, 123.2, 120.8, 114.6, 111.0, 55.7, 52.1,50.6, 38.8, 32.0, 20.1. MS (Cl) m/z353 (M+). The weight ratio of ginger oil to 4-trifluoromethylbenzylamine used in the reductive amination is about 3:1 (from 2.7:1 to 3.3:1).

Toluene, reflux -H20, Dean-Stark Vanillylacetone 2) NaBH4, Μ℮ΟΗ Vanillylacetone (5.00 g, 25.7 mmol) was dissolved in toluene (250 ml_) and 4-trifluoromethylbenzylamine (4.73 g, 27.0 mmol) was added. The mixture was maintained under an atmosphere of nitrogen and heated at reflux with removal of water by Dean-Stark distillation for 16 hours. At this time the Dean-Stark trap was removed and the reaction mixture was cooled to 0°C on an ice bath.

Product-containing fractions were combined and concentrated then dried under high vacuum overnight to provide a light brown oil (6.72 g, 74% ). 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and Mass Spectrum of the product were substantially the same as those in Example 2, A (made by the Conditioned Extraction method). Example ΑΑ: Exocytosis assay/MTT assay Primary neurons from Ε18 Sprague-Dawley rat embryos are plated at optimized concentrations in 384 well plates in ΝΒ media (Invitrogen). Neurons are maintained in cultures for 3 weeks, with twice weekly feeding of ΝΒ media with N2 supplement (Invitrogen). A test compound is added to cells, followed by addition of Vehicle or Abeta oligomer preparations (1.5 μΜ), and incubated for 1 to 24 hr at 37 °C in 5% C02. ΜΤΤ reagent (3-(4,5-dimethylthizaol-2yl)-2,5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) is reconstituted in phosphate buffered saline to 5mg/mL. 10 pL of ΜΤΤ labeling reagent is added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, then imaged. Each assay plate is formatted so that compounds are tested with and without Abeta on each plate. This design eliminates toxic or metabolically active compounds early on in the screening cascade (at the level of the primary screen). Statistical performance of the screening plate layout are assessed, screening will be initiated if the current performance is maintained. Similar procedures for exocytosis assays/MTT assays can be found in the literature. See e.g., Liu Υ, et. al., Detecting bioactive amyloid beta peptide species in Alzheimer's disease.

Epub 2008 Jun 22)constitute the positive controls. Negative controls include vehicle-treated neurons as well as neurons treated with 28 μΜ concentrations of memantine. Memantine produces 50% inhibition of oligomer effects at this dose. These controls, on each plate, serve as normalization tools to calibrate assay performance on a plate-by-plate basis. Primary neuronal cultures Optimal cell density is determined based on cellular response to Abeta oligomers using the exocytosis assay as a readout, and immunohistochemical analysis of the relative proportion of glia to neurons in the cultures. Cultures are monitored on a weekly basis with immunohistochemistry and image processing-based quantification to monitor the percentage of the cultures that are neurons vs. glia (Glial cells). Cultures containing more than 20% glia (positive for GFAP) vs. neurons (staining positively with antibodies directed against ΜΑΡ2) at the screening age of 21 days in vitro (21 DIV) are rejected. Abeta Oligomer preparations Human amyloid peptide 1-42 is obtained from California Peptide, with lot-choice contingent upon quality control analysis. Quality controls of oligomer preparations consist of Westerns to determine oligomer size ranges and relative concentrations, and the ΜΤΤ assay to confirm exocytosis acceleration without toxicity. Toxicity is monitored in each image-based assay via quantification of nuclear morphology visualized with the DNA binding dye DAPI (Invitrogen). Nuclei that are fragmented are considered to be in late stage apoptosis (Majno and Joris ‘95). Peptide lots producing unusual peptide size ranges or significant toxicity at a standard 1.5 uM concentration on neurons are rejected. Plate-based controls -The assay optimization will be complete when reformatted plates achieve a minimum of statistically significant two-fold separation between vehicle and Abeta oligomer-treated neurons (p<0.01, Student’s t-test, unequal variance) on a routine basis, with no more than 10% CV between plates, equivalent to its current performance. Statistical software and Analysis'. Data handling and analysis are accomplished by Cellomics VTI image analysis software and STORE automated database software. Because of the low dynamic range and neuronal well-to-well variability after three weeks in culture, statistical comparisons are made via pairwise Tukey-Kramer analysis to determine the significance of the separation between compound + Abeta oligomers from Abeta alone, and between compound alone from vehicle. These statistics are more akin to what is seen in animal behavioral testing than the z’ statistic that has been used for the past two decades in high throughput screening. The ability of mature primary neurons to more closely approximate the electrophysiologically mediated signal transduction network of the adult brain justifies this screening strategy. Power analysis will be set for a number of replicate screening wells that will minimize false negatives (e.g Ν=4) and shift the burden of distinguishing false positives from actual hits to dose-response confirmation screening. Rank ordering of compounds is done on the basis of secondary assay mechanism of action and physicochemical properties of the compound structures. Certain test compounds significantly reverse the effects of Abeta oligomers but not affect neuronal metabolism. Compound Example 1 was dosed in the ΜΤΤ assay and was shown to block the Abeta oligomer-induced acceleration of exocytosis with an EC50 of 10 μΜ, indicating that Compound Example 1 blocks/abate the activity/effect of Abeta oligomer on neuron cells. Example ΒΒ: Binding Assay Each test compound was added to a plate followed by an addition of one or more of Abeta 1-42 Oligomers. The plates were fixed with 3.7 % paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min. The plate was then washed 3χ with PBS for 5 min each. The plates were blocked at room temperature for 1 hour in 5 % goat serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 (CAS number: 9002-93-1) in PBS. Primary antibodies (anti-MAP 2 polyclonal, Millipore #ΑΒ5622 and anti-Beta Amyloid 6Ε10 monoclonal, Convance #SIG-39300) were diluted 1:1000 in 5 % goat serum with PBS. Primary antibodies were incubated either overnight at 4 °C or 1 hour at RT. The plate was then washed 3χ with PBS for 5 min each. Secondary antibodies (Alex Flor 488 polyclonal, Invitrogen # Α11008 and Alexa Flor 647 monoclonal, Invitrogen #Α21235) were diluted 1:1000 in 5 % goat serum with PBS. Secondary antibodies were incubated at RT for 1 hr. The plates were washed once with PBS. DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Invitrogen) was then applied at 0.03 pg/pL and incubated at RT for 5 min, then washed with PBS. Image process was carried out for analysis. Similar procedures for binding assays can be found in the literature. See e.g., Look GC, et. al. Discovery of ADDL-targeting small molecule drugs for Alzheimer's disease.

Epub 2008 Jun 22) will serve as positive controls. Quality controls of oligomer preparations consist of Westerns to determine oligomer size ranges and relative concentrations, and the ΜΤΤ assay to confirm exocytosis acceleration without toxicity. Toxicity is monitored in each image-based assay via quantification of nuclear morphology visualized with the DNA binding dye DAPI (Invitrogen). Nuclei that are fragmented are considered to be in late stage apoptosis (Majno and Joris Apoptosis, oncosis, and necrosis. An overview of cell death. Am J Pathol 1995;146:3-16). Peptide lots producing unusual peptide size ranges or significant toxicity at standard concentrations on neurons are rejected. Image Processing Images were captured and analyzed with the Cellomics VTI automated microscope platform, using the Neuronal Profiling algorithm. For statistical analysis, a Tukey-Kramer pair-wise comparison with unequal variance was used. Western blots Samples containing Abeta 1-42 were diluted (1:5) in non-reducing lane marker sample buffer (Pierce #1859594). A 30 microliter (pl_) sample was loaded onto an eighteen well precast 4-15% Tris-HCI gel (BIORAD #345-0028). Electrophoresis was performed in a BIO-RAD Criterian precast gel system using Tris-Glycine buffer at 125 volt (V) for 90 minutes. The gels were blotted onto 0.2 μΜ nitrocellulose membranes in Tris-Glycine/10% methanol buffer at 30V for 120 minutes. The membranes were boiled for 5 minutes in a PBS solution and blocked over night with TBS/5% milk solution at 4 °C. The membrane was probed with 6E10-HRP (Covance #SIG-39345) diluted to 10 pg/mL in TBS/1 % milk solution for one hour at room temperature. Membrane was washed three times for 40 minutes each with a solution of TBS/0.05% tween-20 and developed with ECL reagent (BIO-RAD #162-0112) for 5 minutes. Image acquisition was performed on an Alpha Innotech FluorChem Q quantitative imaging system and analyzed with AlphaView Q software. ΡΚ studies: ΡΚ studies are performed at CEREP Inc of Redmond WA, according to their standard protocols:: The plasma samples were processed using acetonitrile precipitation and analyzed by HPLC-MS or HPLC-MS/MS. Peak areas were recorded, and the concentrations of the test compound in the unknown plasma samples were determined using the respective calibration curve. The reportable linear range of the assay was determined, along with the lower limit of quantitation (LLQ). NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry: Active fractions were analyzed by 1Η NMR (Varian 500 MHz NMR spectrometer) and purified compounds were characterized using a combination 1D and 2D 1Η NMR experiments and 13C NMR experiments. Structure proof was obtained using these NMR techniques in combination with low resolution mass spectrometry to determine molecular weight and high resolution mass spectrometry (Thermo Finnigan LCQ Ion trap) to determine composition-of-matter. Compound Example 1 was shown to partially block binding of the Abeta oligomer ligand to neurons by 24% according to the binding assay (using imaging processing algorithm). Example CC: Pharmacokinetic Studies Pharmacokinetic studies were performed according to the following protocols: The plasma samples were processed using acetonitrile precipitation and analyzed by HPLC-MS or HPLC-MS/MS. Peak areas were recorded, and the concentrations of the test compound in the unknown plasma samples were determined using the respective calibration curve. The reportable linear range of the assay was determined, along with the lower limit of quantitation (LLQ). For example, Compound Example 1 was determined to have a half life of 46 minutes in the plasma of rats when injected intravenously at 1 mg/Kg. Example DD: A primary neuron-based functional screening assay to detect small molecule Abeta oligomer blockers. Primary rat neurons grown for at least 3 weeks in vitro were chosen as the basis for this screening assay. These neurons express the full complement of synaptic proteins characteristic of neurons in the mature brain, and exhibit a complex network of activitydependent electrical signaling. Neurons and glia in such cultures have molecular signaling networks exhibiting excellent registration with intact brain circuitry, and for this reason have been used for over two decades as a model system for learning and memory (See e.g. Kaech S, Banker G. Culturing hippocampal neurons. Nat Protoc. 2006;1(5):2406-15. Epub 2007 Jan 11 ; See also Craig AM, Graf ER, Linhoff MW. How to build a central synapse: clues from cell culture. Trends Neurosci. 2006 Jan;29(1):8-20. Epub 2005 Dec 7. Review). More complex systems such as acute or organotypic brain slices are very useful but not amenable to high throughput screening. Immortalized or transformed neuronal cell lines are amenable to high throughput screening, but do not replicate the electrophysiological statedependent signaling of primary neuronal cultures and are unlikely to adequately model the subtle alterations in this signaling that are caused by oligomers during the earliest manifestations of the disease state (See e.g. Gortz Ρ, Fleischer W, Rosenbaum C, Otto F, Siebler Μ. Neuronal network properties of human teratocarcinoma cell line-derived neurons. Brain Res. 2004 Aug 20;1018(1):18-25). For this reason, primary neuronal cultures were chosen because of their ability to be used in high throughput screens and fidelity to what occurs in vivo. Reduced formazan was first visible in intracellular vesicles (Figure 1 A). Example of neurons filled with labeled vesicles following endocytosis of dye and reduction to an insoluble purple product. (Scale bar = 20 microns in Figure 1 A). Eventual formazan exocytosis was accelerated via Abeta oligomers in mature hippocampal neurons in vitro (Figure 1Β). Example photomicrograph of neurons covered with insoluble purple dye that have been extruded via exocytosis. The dye precipitated in the aqueous environment of the culture and formed needle-shaped crystals on the surface of the neuron. (Figure 1Β). Endocytosis rate was altered in the presence of Abeta oligomers. (Figure 1C) Exocytosis rate was altered in the presence of Abeta oligomers (Figure 1D). Since synaptic and memory deficits, and not widespread cell death, predominate at the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease, assays that measure these changes can be used to discover small molecule inhibitors of oligomer activity. The ΜΤΤ assay can be used as a measure of toxicity in cultures. Yellow tetrazolium salts were endocytosed by cells and reduced to insoluble purple formazan in the endosomal pathway. The level of purple formazan was a reflection of the number of actively metabolizing cells in culture, and reduction in the amount of formazan was taken as a measure of cell death or metabolic toxicity in culture. When observed through a microscope, the purple formazan was first visible in intracellular vesicles that fill the cell (Figure. 1 A). Over time, the vesicles were exocytosed and the formazan precipitated as needle-shaped crystals on the outer surface of the plasma membrane as the insoluble formazan was exposed to the aqueous media environment (Figure 1Β). Cells respond to sublethal levels of Abeta oligomers by selectively accelerating the exocytosis rate of reduced formazan, while leaving endocytosis rate unaffected, which can be seen in mature primary neurons in vitro and quantified these morphological shifts via automated microscopy and image processing. At a given point in time following tetrazolium salt addition to the culture well, vehicle-treated cells had the appearance of those in Figure 1 A, while Abeta oligomer-treated cells had the appearance of those in Figure 1Β. Under these circumstances, there was no overall change in the total amount of reduced formazan, simply a shift in its morphology. This assay is sensitive to low levels of oligomers that do not cause cell death. Evidence suggests that Abeta oligomer-mediated reduction in neuronal surface receptor expression mediated by membrane trafficking are the basis for oligomer inhibition of electrophysiological measures of synaptic plasticity (LTP) and thus learning and memory (See Kamenetz F, Tomita Τ, Hsieh Η, Seabrook G, Borchelt D, Iwatsubo Τ, Sisodia S, Malinow R. ΑΡΡ processing and synaptic function. Neuron. 2003 Mar 27;37(6):925-37; and Hsieh Η, Boehm J, Sato C, Iwatsubo Τ, Tomita Τ, Sisodia S, Malinow R. AMPAR removal underlies Abeta-induced synaptic depression and dendritic spine loss. Neuron. 2006 Dec 7;52(5):831-43). Measuring membrane trafficking rate changes induced by oligomers via formazan morphological shifts has been used in cell lines to discover Abeta oligomerblocking drugs [Maezawa I, Hong HS, Wu HC, Battina SK, Rana S, Iwamoto Τ, Radke GA, Pettersson Ε, Martin GM, Hua DH, Jin LW.

(Epub ahead of print)] that lower Abeta brain levels in rodents in vivo [Hong HS, Rana S, Barrigan L, Shi A, Zhang Υ, Zhou F, Jin LW, Hua DH. Inhibition of Alzheimer's amyloid toxicity with a tricyclic pyrone molecule in vitro and in vivo. J Neurochem. 2009 Feb;108(4):1097-1108]. The exocytosis assay was adapted for use with mature primary neuronal cultures grown for 3 weeks in vitro. Abeta oligomers caused a dose-dependent decrease in the amount of intracellular vesicles (puncta) filled with reduced purple formazan (Figure. 2Α, squares; 3μΜ dose corresponds to image in Figure 2C) as measured via image processing using a Cellomics VTI automated microscopy system. Increasing the amount of Abeta oligomers eventually resulted in overt toxicity. Thus, the concentration of neuroactive Abeta oligomers was much lower than that causing cell death. This decrease can be blocked by adding stoichiometric amounts of anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody 6Ε10 (IgG) to the cultures prior to oligomer addition (Figure 2Α, circle; the circle corresponds to image in Figure 2D; antibody alone [down triangle] has no effect on the neurons). Several compounds were tested that have been reported to block the effects of Abeta oligomers, including the sugar alcohol scyllo-inositol (AZD-103), the nAChR antagonist hexamethonium bromide, and the NMDAR antagonists MK-801 and none were active (Fenili et al., ’07, Calabrese et al., ’06, LeCor et al., ‘07). The assay was optimized for performance in 384-well microtiter plates with automated liquid handling robotics for compound formatting and assay plate stamping, routinely achieving statistically significant two-fold separation between vehicle and Abeta oligomer-treated neurons (Student’s t-test, unequal variance). Compounds were added to neurons first, then oligomers were added. When configured in this manner the assay was able to detect compounds that act via disruption of oligomers, inhibition of oligomer binding to neurons, or counteraction of signal transduction mechanisms of action initiated by oligomer binding. Compounds were considered active if they significantly block Abeta-mediated changes in membrane trafficking, but do not significantly affect membrane trafficking when dosed on their own. An example is shown in Figure 2Β; Compound Example 2 inhibits oligomer effects on membrane trafficking with an EC50 of 7μΜ. Figure 2Α shows dose-dependent decrease of intracellular formazan-filled vesicles (puncta) caused by Abeta 42 oligomer treatment acceleration of exocytosis (squares). Oligomer effects were blocked by anti Abeta IgG (circle and up triangle; circle refers to stoich amount of IgG, i.e., 3μΜ of Αβ and 1.5 μΜ of IgG; up triangle refers to substoich IgG, i.e., 3μΜ of Αβ and 0.5 μΜ of IgG). IgG itself (down triangle) has no effect. Figure 2Β shows Example Compound 2, which inhibits oligomer effects on membrane trafficking. Figure 2C shows representative micrographs of 21DIV hippocampal neurons in vitro showing oligomer effects membrane trafficking (corresponding to data point 3μΜ in Figure 2Α); and Figure 2D shows blockade by anti-Abeta antibodies (corresponding to the circle in Figure 2Α). Data were the average of 3 experiments. Scale bar = 20 micron in Figure 2D. Example EE: Fear Conditioning Assay Compound Example 2 was tested in an animal model of a memory-dependent behavioral task known as fear conditioning. The study protocol was designed based on published protocols (See e.g. Puzzo D, Privitera L, Leznik Ε, Fa Μ, Staniszewski A, Palmeri A, Arancio O. Picomolar amyloid-beta positively modulates synaptic plasticity and memory in hippocampus. J Neurosci. 2008 Dec 31 ;28(53):14537-45.). The formation of contextual memories is dependent upon the integrity of medial temporal lobe structures such as the hippocampus. In this assay mice were trained to remember that a particular salient context (conditioned stimulus; CS) is associated with an aversive event, in this case a mild foot shock (the unconditioned stimulus, US). Animals that show good learning will express an increase in freezing behavior when placed back into the same context. This freezing is absent in a novel context. Increased freezing in the context indicates strong hippocampaldependent memory formation in animals. Memory tested in Fear Conditioning is sensitive to elevations of soluble Αβ. Figure 3 shows the results of administration of Abeta oligomers (bar labeled with “a”) during training results in memory deficits when animals are tested 24 later, compared to vehicle administration (bar labeled with “b”). Example Compound 2 was effective at stopping Abeta oligomer mediated effects on membrane trafficking (Figure. 3). When administered to animals prior to Abeta oligomer administration, Example Compound 2 blocked oligomer effects on memory in a dose-dependent manner. The compound completely blocked oligomer-mediated memory deficits at the 2 pmol dose (Figure 3, bar labeled with “d”). This behavioral efficacy demonstrates that the membrane trafficking assay is able to predict which compounds will be efficacious in treating the behavioral memory loss caused by oligomers. The fear condition model for memory was performed as described herein. Figure 3 shows that Abeta produces significant deficits in memory formation vs. vehicle (p<0.05) in the contextual fear conditioning memory task. Figure 3 shows that the 2 pmol dose of Compound Example 2 + Abeta (200ηΜ) completely blocked the effect of Abeta on memory (p<0.05, one way ANOVA, post hoc comparison with Bonferroni correction). No effect of compound alone was observed(data not shown). No adverse behavioral changes were observed at any dose. Example FF: Membrane Trafficking Assay: Abeta assemblies were isolated from patients with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) or from normal patients. The Abeta assemblies were tested for their ability to modulate membrane trafficking. HMW (>100KDa) Abeta assemblies isolated from AD patients do not affect membrane trafficking (not shown). IMW (10-1 OOKDa) Abeta assemblies isolated from AD patients significantly affect membrane trafficking. (Figure 4). IMW Abeta assemblies isolated from Age-matched normal individuals do not affect membrane trafficking (Figure 4). Compound Example 2 has no effect on Abeta assemblies isolated from Age-matched normal individuals. (Figure 4). Compound Example 2 significantly blocked the trafficking effects of AD-brain derived Abeta aseemblies. (Figure 4).
