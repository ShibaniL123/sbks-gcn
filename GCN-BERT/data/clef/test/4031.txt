CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of the U.S. provisional application No. 61/701,767 filed Sep. 17, 2012, the contents of which incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The technology disclosed relate to the field of melanoma and knock-out transgenic mice. The transgenic mice are used for screening for therapeutic candidates for treatment of melanoma. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Melanoma is a malignant tumor of melanocytes, and can originate in any part of the body that contains melanocytes. There are 160,000 new cases diagnosed each year, and about 48,000 melanoma related deaths reported each year. Melanoma is the most incurable cancer once the cancerous cells have metastasized to distant part of the body. Therefore, metastatic melanomas have to be aggressively treated with current and newer therapies. A good number of mutations have been found in melanoma. For examples, mutations in BRAF and NRAS genes have found in melanomas, and these mutations have been known to activate downstream MEK-ERK oncogenic signal transduction pathway, or MAPK pathway. The MAPK pathway is an important signaling cascade driving cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival and could have an important role in the pathogenesis of melanoma. In addition, it is known that redhead humans are at higher risk for melanoma. The redhead phenotype includes red hair, fair skin and poor tanning ability. This phenotype is due to mutations in a gene called melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). An improved understanding of the role of these genetic mutations in melanoma development could result in advancements in treatments of melanoma and cancers, and the development of targeted therapy directed towards highly susceptible humans such as redheads. Currently, there is still a need for tools that aid in such discoveries and development. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Embodiments herein are based on the discovery that transgenic mice having genomic mutations in a melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene and a BRAF gene have high incidences of invasive melanomas. In humans, the mutation in MC1R gene produces a premature termination of the MC1R transcript and a truncated MC1R protein. This MC1R mutation known to produce the redhead phenotype which includes red hair, high pheomelanin versus eumelanin production, fair skin and poor tanning ability. The gene mutation in the BRAF gene is a V600E substitution that is common in many highly invasive melanomas. It is also known that humans with the redhead phenotype are prone to melanoma. Therefore, such transgenic mice transgenic mice are useful animal systems and tools for screening therapeutic candidates for the treatment of melanoma.

As used herein, the term “BRAF gene” refers to a nucleotide sequence encoding a full-length wild-type BRAF protein. Examples of a BRAF gene includes nucleotide sequences encoding the human BRAF gene (Genbank Accession Nos: M95712, M95720, X54072, NM—004333.4), and the mouse BRAF gene (Genbank Accession No.: NM—139294.5). In one embodiment, as used herein, the term “deficient in the MC1R gene” or “MC1R-deficient” means that no functional MC1R 1 protein is produced due to the disruption of the MC1R 1 gene or non-expression of the MC1R protein. In another embodiment, “deficient in the MC1R gene” or “MC1R-deficient” means a truncated MC1R protein that is incapable of binding its ligand, melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and/or does not any transduce signal upon ligand or other agonist binding. The signal is the induction of cAMP levels in the cell. This can be measured by either directly quantifying cAMP levels or the downstream consequences of cAMP increases, such as the phosphorylation of CREB protein. These measurements can be made by any method known in the art, e.g., as described in J. Lyons et al, 2013, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. N.Y., vol. 110:13845-13850; in C. Herraiz, et al., 2011, Mol. Endocrinology, vol. 25:138-156; and in A. G. Smith, 2008, J. Biol. Chem. Vol. 283: 12564-12570. These references are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. As used herein, the term “functional MC1R protein” refers to a MC1R protein that responds to stimulation by melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) exposure by stimulating the synthesis of cAMP inside cells. cAMP can be directly measured using various assays, or can be indirectly measured through its downstream effects in cells, such as induction of phosphorylation of CREB protein. As used herein, the term “inactivating form of a MC1R protein” refers to a form of a MC1R protein that is that is incapable of binding its ligand, melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and/or does not any transduce signal upon ligand or other agonist binding.

When a cell or animal has two identical or substantially similar alleles of a gene, it is said to be “homozygous.” In contrast, when the cell or animal has two substantially different alleles it is said to be “heterozygous” for that gene. As used herein, the term “transgene” refers to a nucleic acid sequence which is partly or entirely heterologous, i.e., foreign, to the transgenic animal or cell into which it is introduced, or, is homologous to an endogenous gene of the transgenic animal or cell into which it is introduced, but which is designed to be inserted, or is inserted, into the animal's genome in such a way as to alter the genome of the cell into which it is inserted (e.g., it is inserted at a location which differs from that of the natural gene or its insertion results in a knockout). A transgene can be operably linked to one or more transcriptional regulatory sequences and any other nucleic acid, such as introns, that may be necessary for optimal expression of a selected nucleic acid. Exemplary transgenes of the present disclosure encode, for instance, a neomycine resistance gene fused with a mouse MC1R cDNA coding nucleotides 1-150 and a Cre recombinase enzyme. Other exemplary transgenes are directed to disrupting a MC1R gene by homologous recombination with genomic sequences of a MC1R gene. As used herein, “test candidate” refers to any substance that, when administered to the disclosed transgenic mice, can prevent, inhibit or stop the development of melanomas in the disclosed transgenic mice compared to in the absence of the administered test candidate. In some embodiment, the test candidate reduces the number and/or rate of melanomas formation compared to in the absence of the administered therapeutic candidate. Examples of test candidates include, but are not limited to, small organic molecules, large organic molecules, amino acids, peptides, polypeptides, nucleotides, nucleic acids (including DNA, cDNA, RNA, antisense RNA and any double- or single-stranded forms of nucleic acids), polynucleotides, carbohydrates, lipids, lipoproteins, glycoproteins, inorganic ions (including, for example, Gd3+, lead and lanthanum).

In some embodiments, “therapeutic candidates” include currently known B-RAF inhibitors, MAPK inhibitors, NRAS inhibitors and/or c-KIT inhibitors. Some examples of B-Raf inhibitors include, but are in no way limited to, vemurafenib, GDC-0879, PLX-4720, Sorafenib Tosylate, dabrafenib, and LGX818. As used herein, the term “inhibitor” when used in reference to the MAPK pathway, B-Raf, NRAS and/or c-KIT, refers to an agent that inhibits the normal cellular activities of the proteins that are involved, that constitute, or that are participants in the MAPK pathway, or the normal cellular activities of B-Raf, NRAS and/or c-KIT. As used herein, the term “comprising” or “comprises” is used in reference to methods and compositions, and respective component(s) thereof, that are essential to the invention, yet open to the inclusion of unspecified elements, whether essential or not. The use of “comprising” indicates inclusion rather than limitation. The term “consisting of” refers to methods, and respective components thereof as described herein, which are exclusive of any element not recited in that description of the embodiment. Embodiments of the present disclosure herein are based on the discovery that transgenic mice having genomic mutations in a melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene and a BRAF gene have high incidences of invasive melanomas. The mutation in MC1R gene produces a premature termination of the MC1R transcript and a truncated MC1R protein. This MC1R mutation known to be responsible for the redhead phenotype, a phenotype which includes red hair, high pheomelanin versus eumelanin production, fair skin and poor tanning ability. The gene mutation in the BRAF gene is a V600E substitution that is common in many highly invasive melanomas. It is also known that humans with the redhead phenotype are prone to melanoma. Therefore, such transgenic mice are useful animal systems and tools for screening therapeutic candidates for the treatment of melanoma. In particular, the transgenic animal systems are useful where the melanomas involve MC1R and BRAF mutations. People with pale skin, red hair, freckles, and an inability to tan, the “redhead” phenotype, are at highest risk of developing melanoma, compared to all other pigmentation types′. Genetically, the redhead phenotype is frequently the product of inactivating polymorphisms in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. MC1R encodes a cAMP MC1Rulating G-protein coupled receptor that controls pigment production. Minimal receptor activity, as in redhead polymorphisms, produces red/yellow sulfur-containing pheomelanin pigment, while increasing MC1R activity MC1Rulates production of black/brown non-sulfuric eumelanin. Pheomelanin has weak UV shielding capacity relative to eumelanin and has been shown to amplify UVA-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)3-5. Several observations, however, complicate the assumption that melanoma risk is completely UV dependent. For example, unlike non-melanoma skin cancers, melanoma is not restricted to sun-exposed skin and UV signature mutations are infrequently oncogenic drivers6. While linkage of melanoma risk to UV exposure is beyond doubt, UV-independent events are also likely to play a significant role1,7. Disclosed herein, the inventors introduced into mice carrying an inactivating mutation in the Mc1r gene (who exhibit a phenotype analogous to redheaded humans), a conditional, melanocyte-targeted allele of the most commonly mutated melanoma oncogene, BRafV600E. The inventors observed a high incidence of invasive melanomas without providing additional oncogenic or tumor suppressor gene aberrations or UV exposure. To investigate the mechanism of UV-independent carcinogenesis, the inventors introduced an albino allele, which ablates all pigment production on the redhead-Mc1r e/e background. Selective absence of pheomelanin synthesis was protective against melanoma. In addition, normal redhead-Mc1re/e mouse skin was found to have significantly greater oxidative DNA and lipid damage than albino-Mc1re/e mouse skin. These data indicate that the pheomelanin pigment pathway produces UV-independent carcinogenic contributions to melanomagenesis by a mechanism of oxidative damage, which carries significant implications regarding melanoma prevention strategies. Accordingly, in one embodiment, provided herein is a transgenic mouse whose genome comprises a mutation of a MC1R gene and a mutation of a B-RAF gene. In one embodiment, the MC1R gene mutation is a homozygous mutation. In one embodiment, the BRAF gene mutation is a homozygous or a heterologous mutation. In one embodiment, the transgenic mouse has a homozygous mutation of the MC1R gene and a homozygous mutation of the B-RAF gene. In one embodiment, the transgenic mouse has a knock-out mutation in the MC1R gene. Consequently, there is no expression of the MC1R protein, either full-length or truncation. In another embodiment, the transgenic mouse has a point mutation in the MC1R gene that results in the premature transcription termination of the MC1R gene. In one embodiment, the resultant MC1R protein is a truncated protein. Consequently, the transgenic mouse expresses an inactivating form of the MC1R protein. In this embodiment, the transgenic mouse is deficient in the MC1R gene or is MC1R-deficient. This is because the truncated MC1R protein is no capable of carrying out in normal function in the absence of its missing amino acid sequence. In one embodiment, the transgenic mouse exhibits a mutant form of the BRAF protein and expresses no MC1R protein. In one embodiment, the transgenic mouse exhibits a mutant form of the BRAF protein and an inactivating form of the MC1R protein. In one embodiment, the transgenic mouse produces an inactivating form of a MC1R protein. When the MC1R protein is nonfunctional, the resulting mouse contains melanocytes that synthesis red pigment (pheomelanin) but not black pigment (eumelanin). Consequently these MC1R deficient mice are a model of the redhair-fairskin phenotype of humans, since human redheaded/fairskinned people also typically contain deficient variant forms of the MC1R protein. Melanocortin receptors are members of the rhodopsin family of 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors. There are five known members of the melanocortin receptor system, MC1R, MC2R, MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R; each with differing specificities for melanocortins. The human MC1-R gene was first cloned in 1992, and has been mapped to chromosome 16q24.3.24 The MC1-R is found on many cell types in the skin, including melanocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and antigen-presenting cells; however, melanocytes clearly have the highest density of MC1-R. MC1R is associated with pigmentation genetics. See J. V. Schaffer, and J. L. Bolognia, (2001) Arch Dermatol. 137(11):1477-1485. The human MC1-R gene is an intronless gene that encodes the receptor protein for melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). The encoded protein, a seven pass transmembrane G protein coupled receptor, controls melanogenesis. Two types of melanin exist: red pheomelanin and black eumelanin. Gene mutations that lead to a loss in function are associated with increased pheomelanin production, which leads to lighter skin and hair color. Eumelanin is photoprotective but pheomelanin may contribute to UV-induced skin damage by generating free radicals upon UV radiation. Binding of MSH to its receptor activates the receptor and stimulates eumelanin synthesis. This receptor is a major determining factor in sun sensitivity and is a genetic risk factor for melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer. Over 30 variant alleles have been identified which correlate with skin and hair color, providing evidence that this gene is an important component in determining normal human pigment variation. The receptor is primarily located on the surface of melanocytes, which are specialized cells that produce a pigment called melanin. Melanin is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. Melanin is also found in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), where it plays a role in normal vision. Melanocytes make two forms of melanin, eumelanin and pheomelanin. The relative amounts of these two pigments help determine the color of a person's hair and skin. People who produce mostly eumelanin tend to have brown or black hair and dark skin that tans easily. Eumelanin also protects skin from damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation in sunlight. People who produce mostly pheomelanin tend to have red or blond hair, freckles, and light-colored skin that tans poorly. Because pheomelanin does not protect skin from UV radiation, people with more pheomelanin have an increased risk of skin damage caused by sun exposure. The melanocortin 1 receptor controls which type of melanin is produced by melanocytes. When the receptor is activated, it triggers a series of chemical reactions inside melanocytes that stimulate these cells to make eumelanin. If the receptor is not activated or is blocked, melanocytes make pheomelanin instead of eumelanin. Common variations (polymorphisms) in the MC1R gene are associated with normal differences in skin and hair color. Certain genetic variations are most common in people with red hair, fair skin, freckles, and an increased sensitivity to sun exposure. These MC1R polymorphisms reduce the ability of the melanocortin 1 receptor to stimulate eumelanin production, causing melanocytes to make mostly pheomelanin. Although MC1R is a key gene in normal human pigmentation, researchers believe that the effects of other genes also contribute to a person's hair and skin coloring. Loss-of-function mutation of the human MC1R gene is described in Abdel-Malek Z A., et al. J Cell Sci. 2001 March; 114(Pt 5):1019-24, and in J. V. Schaffer and J. L. Bolognia, Arch Dermatol. 2001; 137(11):1477-1485. The references are incorporated by reference in their entirety. BRAF belongs to a family of serine-threonine protein kinases that includes ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF (RAF1). RAF kinases are central mediators in the MAP kinase signaling cascade and exert their effect predominantly through phosphorylation and activation of MEK. This occurs following the dimerization (hetero- or homo-) of the RAF molecules. As part of the MAP kinase pathway, RAF is involved in many cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and transcriptional regulation. Mutant BRAF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, and ovarian cancer. Mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alterations in melanoma, found in ˜50% of tumor. The most frequent BRAF mutation is the substitution of valine at position 600 by glutamic acid (BRAF V600E) that results in the constitutive activation of its serine/threonine kinase activity and sustained activation of MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. BRAF directly phosphorylates the dual-specificity kinases MEK1 and MEK2, which in turn phosphorylate and activate the mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK1 and ERK2. BRAF has been shown by overexpression and knockdown experiments to be a critical mediator of melanomagenesis. In mice, activation of BRAF in combination with deletion of the tumor suppressor genes PTEN or INK4A leads to melanoma with complete. Conversely, treatment of BRAF mutant melanomas in vitro with chemical inhibitors of BRAF or MEK1/2 promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) leads to tumor regression and improved overall survival in patients whose melanomas have the BRAF(V600E) mutation, leading to its approval as a treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma. Despite the promise and dramatic initial effects of BRAF inhibitors in the clinic, patients eventually relapse within several months, suggesting that combination therapies may be needed to overcome intrinsic or acquired resistance. Detailed descriptions on the productions of knockout mouse, mouse with genomic homologous or heterologous mutations and protocols of preparation and gene targeting of ES cells, electroporation, clonal selection and more are available in the following books: Hogan, B., Beddington, R., Costantini, F. and Lacy, E. (1994) Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Porter et al., Eur. J. Biochem., vol. 218, pp. 273-281 (1993); Bradley, A. (1991) “Modifying the mammalian genome by gene targeting” Current Opinion in Biotechnology 2: 823-829; Capecchi, M., “The New Mouse Genetics: Altering the Genome by Gene Targeting,” Trends in Genetics, vol. 5, No. 3, 70-76 (1989); U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,100,445, 6,060,642, 6,365,796, 6,747,187, and 7,166,764, and they are hereby explicitly incorporated by reference. In a knockout, preferably the target gene expression is undetectable or insignificant. A knock-out of a MC1R gene means that the function of the respective MC1R protein has been substantially decreased so that expression is not detectable or only present at insignificant levels. This may be achieved by a variety of mechanisms, including introduction of a disruption of the coding sequence, e.g. insertion of one or more stop codons, insertion of a DNA fragment, etc., deletion of coding sequence, substitution of stop codons for coding sequence, etc. In some cases the exogenous transgene sequences are ultimately deleted from the genome, leaving a net change to the native sequence. Different approaches may be used to achieve the “knock-out”. A chromosomal deletion of all or part of the genomic gene may be induced, including deletions of the non-coding regions, particularly the promoter region, 3′ regulatory sequences, enhancers, or deletions of gene that activate expression of MC1R genes. A functional knock-out may also be achieved by the introduction of an anti-sense construct that blocks expression of the native genes (for example, see Li and Cohen (1996) Cell 85:319-329). “Knock-outs” also include conditional knock-outs, for example where alteration of the target gene occurs upon exposure of the animal to a substance that promotes target gene alteration, introduction of an enzyme that promotes recombination at the target gene site (e.g. Cre in the Cre-lox system), or other method for directing the target gene alteration postnatally.

The transgenic mice are then monitored for the time of first observable melanomas which would give a measurement of the rate of invasive melanomas development. In other word, the latency period before manifestation of melanomas. The transgenic mice are also then monitored for the number of invasive melanomas occurring during a fixed period of time, e.g., 6 months, 1 year. The transgenic mice are also then monitored for survival time and/or rate over time, e.g., 1 year, 2 years. These transgenic mice are compared to control transgenic mice that have been administered a placebo or control mouse chow. The transgenic mice receiving the test candidate are the test transgenic mice. The transgenic mice receiving the placebo or control mouse chow are the control transgenic mice.

All animals used for breeding were backcrossed a minimum of 6 generations onto the C57BL/6 genetic background (this corresponds to a >98.4% C57BL/6 congenic animal, (See internet tutorial at website of jaxmice, jax organization). The black (wild type), redhead (Mc1re/e) and albino (Tyrc/c) animals were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. K14-SCF animals were acquired from T. Kunisada. Genotyping of each litter, including the Tyr-Cre(ER)T2, BRafCA, and PTENflox/flox alleles was performed as previously published10,11. At 6-10 weeks of age the dorsal fur was trimmed using animal shears with a 0.25 mm head and the mice were treated topically with 20 mg/ml tamoxifen for 5 consecutive days. For tumor darkening, a 20% solution of Coleus forskohlii root extract (80 μM forskolin) was topically applied daily as previously described17. For in vivo PLX4720 studies, animals were given ad libitum mouse chow containing 2% PLX4720 by weight or control chow acquired from Plexxikon Inc. All studies and procedures involving animal subjects were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Massachusetts General Hospital and Dana-Farber Harvard Cancer Center and were conducted strictly in accordance with the approved animal handling protocol. Dissection and Histology. Tissues of interest were photographed, excised, weighed, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, rinsed in PBS, and stored in 70% ethanol. Formalin-fixed tissues were paraffin embedded (FFPE) and sectioned (3-5 μm) using standard procedures. Morphological analysis was performed using multiple independent samples per site/organ (5 to 9 samples per genotype) as well as >6 animals. Two pathologists (JKL, MPH) independently examined the histopathology of the tumor samples. Digitization and image capture was performed using an Olympus DP70 digital camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) connected to an Olympus BX51 light microscope or a Scanscope whole-slide scanning system (Aperio, Vista, Calif.). Immunohistochemistry. For immunohistochemistry, sections were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated with a graded series of alcohol. Sections were boiled in 50 mM TRIS-buffer (pH9) or citrate for antigen retrieval and rinsed in PBS. Sections were blocked in 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100 PBS, incubated with 1:200 dilutions of rabbit anti-S100 (Dako), 1:100 dilutions of goat anti-DCT (Santa Cruz), 1:200 dilutions of mouse-anti HMB45 (Santa Cruz) and 1:200 dilutions of mouse-anti gp100 (Abcam) antibodies, followed by visualization with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa594 or Alexa488 (1:500). Appropriate controls for specificity of staining were included and images were captured using an upright fluorescence microscope (Eclipse 90i, Nikon). To identify epidermal melanocytes, skin from reporter mice carrying the various pigmentation alleles and the K14-SCF transgene as well as a DCT-LacZ reporter allele was cryosectioned and stained with XGal and nuclear fast red counterstaining. Primary Cell Culture. Tumor cells were digested overnight in 10 mg/ml collagenase and 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase. Initially tumor cells were grown in RPMI media with HEPES and 20% serum. Subsequently tumor cells were grown in DMEM media with 10% serum. Proliferation after 72 hours of PLX4720 (CHEMIETEK) and U0126 (CELL SIGNALING) was determined by the CELLTITER-GLO Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (PROMEGA). Quantitative RT-PCR. RNA was harvested from primary cultured tumor cells treated for varying times with forskolin or PLX4720 using the RNeasy Plus mini kit (QIAGEN). mRNA expression of melanocytic markers was determined using intron-spanning mouse-specific primers with Kapa SYBR FAST qPCR master mix (KAPA BIOSYSTEMS). Expression was normalized to 18s rRNA and 0 hour time-points. Primer sequences used: Mitf fwd (SEQ ID NO: 1) GCCTGAAACCTTGCTATGCTGGAA, Mitf rev- (SEQ ID NO: 2) AAGGTACTGCTTTACCTGGTGCCT, Dct fwd- (SEQ ID NO: 3) AGGTACCATCTGTTGTGGCTGGAA, Dct rev- (SEQ ID NO: 4) AGTTCCGACTAATCAGCGTTGGGT, Tyrp1 fwd- (SEQ ID NO: 5) TGGGGATGTGGATTTCTCTC, Tyrp1 rev- (SEQ ID NO: 6) AGGGAGAAAGAAGGCTCCTG, 18s fwd- (SEQ ID NO: 7) AGGTTCTGGCCAACGGTCTAG, 18s rev- (SEQ ID NO: 9) CCCTCTATGGGC AATTTT,. Cyclopurine Quantification Extraction of nuclear DNA from mouse skin tissues. Nuclear DNA was isolated from mouse skin using a high-salt method. Tissues were ground under liquid nitrogen into fine powder using a mortar and pestle. A nuclei lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 8.3), 20 mM EDTA, 400 mM NaCl, 1% SDS (w/v) and 0.05% proteinase K (w/v) was added to the tissue and incubated in a water bath at 55° C. overnight. Half volume of saturated NaCl solution was added to the digestion mixture, incubated at 55° C. for 15 min then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged again. The nucleic acids in the supernatant were precipitated with cold ethanol, dissolved in water and incubated in the presence of 0.03% RNase A (w/v) and 0.25 U/μL of RNase T1 at 37° C. overnight, and subsequently extracted with an equal volume of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v) twice. The DNA was then precipitated from the aqueous layer by cold ethanol, centrifuged at 8,000 rpm at 4° C. for 15 min, washed twice with 70% cold ethanol and dried under vacuum. The DNA pellet was dissolved in deionized water and quantified by using ultraviolet absorption spectrophotometry. Enzymatic Digestion of Nuclear DNA. Nuclease P1 (16 U), phosphodiesterase 2 (0.025 U), 20 nmol of EHNA and a 30-μL solution containing 300 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.6) and 10 mM zinc chloride were added to 200 μg of DNA. In this context, EHNA served as an inhibitor for deamination of 2′-deoxyadenosine to 2′-deoxyinosine (dI) induced by adenine deaminase. The above digestion was continued at 37° C. for 48 h. To the digestion mixture were then added alkaline phosphatase (10 U), phosphodiesterase 1 (0.0125 U) and 60 μL of 0.5 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.9). The digestion was continued at 37° C. for 2 h and subsequently neutralized by addition of formic acid. To the mixture were then added uniformly 15N-labeled standard lesions, which included 400 fmol of R-cdG, 150 fmol of S-cdG, 80 fmol of R-cdA and 40 fmol of S-cdA. The enzymes in the digestion mixture were subsequently removed by chloroform extraction twice. The resulting aqueous layer was subjected to off-line high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation for the enrichment of the lesions under study, following our previously described procedures26. LC-MS/MS/MS Analysis. The LC-MS/MS/MS experiments were conducted using an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer using our recently described conditions26. Briefly, the amounts of cdA and cdG lesions in each nucleoside sample were calculated based on the ratios of peak areas found in the selected-ion chromatograms for the analyte (e.g., the 23.5 min peak in the top panel of FIG. 4d for S-cdA) and the corresponding stable isotope-labeled standard (e.g., the 23.4 min peak in the bottom panel of FIG. 4d for the 15N-labeled S-cdA), the known amount of uniformly 15N-labeled standard added to the nucleoside mixture (e.g., 40 fmol for S-cdA), and calibration curves. The calibration curves were constructed from the same LC-MS/MS/MS analyses of a series of mixtures with known compositions of the unlabeled cdA, cdG and constant amounts of the corresponding uniformly 15N-labeled standards, as described previously26. The lesion formation frequencies as shown in FIG. 4e were then calculated by dividing the amounts of cdA and cdG in the sample with the total amount of nucleosides present. Skin Irradiation and Lipid Peroxide Measurement. 6-week old mice were euthanized and fur was removed using animal shears with a 0.25 mm head. Twelve sections of skin, each with an area of 1 cm2, were removed from each mouse and placed in 35 mm dishes on ice after adherence to WHATMAN filter paper suspended in PBS. For each UV and visible light study, 6 sections of skin from each mouse were placed in the dark on ice as controls. For UV studies, 6 sections of skin from each mouse were irradiated on ice with 10 J/cm2 UVA and 0.65 J/cm2 UVB at an irradiance of 6.67 mW/cm2 using a Sylvania 350 Blacklight (Osram Sylvania). This UV distribution is comparable to natural sunlight (96.65% UVA & 3.35% UVB). Two mice of each pigmentation type were used for a total of n=12 skin samples for each condition. For visible light studies, 6 sections of skin from each mouse were irradiated on ice with 180 J/cm2 visible light from a Dolan-Jenner A3200 Fiber-Lite Illuminator at an irradiance of 200 mW/cm2. The illuminator bulb was fit with a Thorlabs FEL0400 Edgepass UV filter with a transmission of <0.001% for wavelengths <400 nm, such that no irradiation output was detectable in the UV range below 400 nm. One mouse of each pigmentation type was used for a total of 6 skin samples for each condition. Following treatment, skin sections were flash frozen and homogenized in PBS containing the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) to prevent further lipid peroxidation, using a QIAGEN TISSUELYSER II. Homogenized samples were centrifuged and supernatants were collected. Protein content of each sample was determined by Coomassie Plus Protein Assay, and samples were diluted with PBS+BHT for normalization of sample concentration (THERMO SCIENTIFIC). Lipid peroxidation of each irradiated set of sample was determined using an OxiSelect TBARS Assay Kit and normalized to its unirradiated control (CELL BIOLABS). Results To study the role of pigmentation in BRafV600E melanoma development, the inventors utilized a series of genetically matched mice on the C57BL/6 background with various pigmentation phenotypes (FIG. 1a). To mimic dark-skinned individuals with a high eumelanin-to-pheomelanin ratio, we used mice with the wild type C57BL/6 pigmentation phenotype (“black”). To mimic individuals with the redhead phenotype who carry a high pheomelanin-to-eumelanin ratio, we used mice with premature termination of the Mc1r transcript (Mc1re/e, redhead)8. To mimic individuals with albinism who have no melanin, mice with an inactivating mutation at the Tyrosinase locus (Tyrc/c, “albino”) were used9. Since tyrosinase is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis, albino melanocytes do not produce any pigment, but are normal in number and viability10. The inventors generated two variants of each pigmentation phenotype. One variant (“normal mouse”) contains melanocytes in the dermis. A second matched variant (“humanized mouse”) contains transgenic Stem Cell Factor expressed under the keratin 14 promoter (“K14-SCF”), which mimics SCF expression in human epidermal keratinocytes and results in epidermal melanocyte localization11. To create a genetic context primed for the induction of melanoma we also introduced into each of the 6 variant mouse produced, a previously published system for inducible, melanocyte-specific expression of oncogenic BRafV600E12. In humans, mice and zebrafish, expression of BRafV600E in melanocytes primarily causes benign nevi, rather than melanoma12-15. In this context, malignant melanoma progression is thought to be constrained by oncogene-induced senescence15. Consistent with this, expression of BRAFV600E in conjunction with silencing of PTEN, TP53 or CDKN2A leads to development of malignant melanoma12-14. Spontaneous progression of BRafV600E-expressing melanocytes to malignant melanoma has been reported, however, following a long latency period in C57BL/6 mice, though this phenomenon was not seen on an outbred model12,16,17. The inventors initially produced 6 groups of BRafV600E inducible (“BRafCA”) mice representing 3 pigmentation variants (“black,” “redhead,” and “albino”) with or without epidermal melanocytes (+/− transgenic K14-SCF, FIG. 1b). Melanocyte-selective expression of BRafV600E was achieved by topical tamoxifen activation of estrogen-receptor fused Cre recombinase (Tyr-Cre(ER)T2) in 6-10 week old mice carrying the BRafCA allele. The animals were then followed without environmental genotoxic stressors (such as UV). Black and albino BRafCA mice developed similarly low rates of melanoma after a long latency (regardless of K14-SCF status). In contrast, redhead BRafCA mice developed melanomas at an accelerated rate with >50% having tumors after one year, regardless of K14-SCF status (FIGS. 1c and 1d). The observation that mice of multiple pigmentation phenotypes can develop melanoma in the context of activation of a single oncogene is consistent with a recently published paper investigating the effect of UV radiation on a mouse model over-expressing hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) Unlike the HGF model, the present study did not find a significant difference in melanoma rates between black and albino animals, but this discrepancy may be due to the fact that the BRAF models were not exposed to UV radiation18. In all three pigmentation contexts the tumors were grossly amelanotic and largely on the dorsal trunk of the mice (within the tamoxifen-treated areas). Occasionally, a tumor would develop on the ventral trunk, tail or paw, which may reflect a predictable spread of tamoxifen secondary to grooming. (FIGS. 2a, 2b and 2c). The tumors, which were primarily dermal, were mostly amelanotic in the redhead background, whereas melanomas in black mice exhibited some superficial pigmentation adjacent to the epidermis. Regardless of pigmentation background, the tumors were histologically similar with spindle cell features which were not easily distinguishable from tumors on C57BL/6 BRafCA-Ptenflox/flox animals generated in parallel (FIG. 2 vs. FIG. 5). Upon closer examination, occasional redhead-BRafV600E tumor cells were found to contain melanin (FIG. 2g and at higher magnification, 2h). It was further possible to increase pigmentation in the most superficial melanoma cells with topical application of forskolin, an adenylate cyclase agonist known to MC1Rulate skin pigmentation19 (FIG. 2i). The limited extent of pigmentation is likely related to forskolin's poor tissue penetration, but nonetheless demonstrates the ability of the melanoma cells to become hyper-pigmented in vivo upon stimulation of cAMP signaling. Tumors on all three pigmentation backgrounds stained positively for 5100, a standard immunohistochemical melanoma marker (FIG. 2j). In addition, RT-PCR revealed that the tumors consistently express the melanocytic pigment genes M-Mitf, Dct, Tyrp1, and Tyr (FIG. 3a, d and data not shown) although immunohistochemical staining for Dct and Mitf were weak or negative, likely because of low-level expression (data not shown). In addition, occasional Hmb45+ cells could be found by immunofluorescence (data not shown). The tumors on all three pigmentation backgrounds were aggressive and locally invasive to fat and skeletal muscle with active mitoses. While no gross visceral organ metastases were observed, small clusters of cells expressing gp100, the premelanosome-associated glycoprotein (Pmel/Gp100/Hmb45), could be found in skin draining lymph nodes (FIG. 2k). Utilizing a primary cell line derived from one of the redhead (BRafV600E-Mc1re/e) melanomas, the inventors observed that forskolin upregulated the expression of the melanocyte-specific isoform of Mitf (M-Mitf), and produced a dramatic increase in expression of the Dct and Tyrp1 pigment genes, consistent with the ability of the cells to respond to melanocytic differentiation signals (FIG. 3a). To determine if the redhead-derived melanomas were dependent on the presumed oncogenic driver BRafV600E, the inventors tested their response to small molecule inhibitors of BRAF or MEK. Treatment with the oncogenic BRAF inhibitor, PLX4720, or the MEK inhibitor, U0126, prevented melanoma cell proliferation in vitro, and PLX4720 blocked tumor cell growth in vivo, consistent with a dependency of these tumors on the BRafV600E oncoprotein (FIGS. 3b and 3c). BRaf inhibition also elevated the expression of melanocytic genes as previously reported in human melanomas (FIG. 3d)20. Since inactivating mutations in Mc1r alter cAMP levels in the cell, redhead mice undoubtedly have numerous intracellular pathway differences relative to wildtype Mc1rE/E (black) animals. For example, prior studies have demonstrated diminished DNA repair capacity, downstream of MC1R variants21,22. The inventors therefore wished to study whether the pheomelanin pigment pathway itself plays an intrinsic mechanistic role, or whether it is merely a marker of melanoma risk. To investigate this question we introduced the albino tyrosinase (Tyrc/c) allele into the redhead Mc1re/e genetic background to test melanoma incidence in albino-Mc1re/e animals, which retain low Mc1r activity and also lack all pigment production (FIG. 4a). A melanocyte-targeted LacZ transgene was used to confirm that the albino allele does not alter melanocyte number in these mice (FIGS. 6a and 6b)10. As shown in FIG. 4b, the albino allele profoundly protected redhead mice from melanoma. The rare albino-Mc1re/e melanomas occurred after long latency and exhibited the same amelanotic, S100+, histologic features as the other pigmentation variant BRafCA mice (FIGS. 7a, 7b and 7c). This observation indicates that the pheomelanin synthesis pathway is necessary for the high rate of UV-independent melanoma in the redhead context. Prior studies have demonstrated that UV radiation amplifies ROS production and the subsequent incidence of oxidative DNA damage in the skin of pigmented mice18. UV radiated cells with high pheomelanin levels have been found to carry particularly high levels of oxidative damage4,5. Pheomelanin or its synthetic intermediates might also elevate ROS independently of UV exposure. For example, the sulfur-containing aromatic rings in pheomelanin (which are absent in eumelanin) may propagate the ROS produced as a normal by-product of metabolism and pigment synthesis23. Since darkly pigmented individuals carry both pheomelanin and eumelanin, it has been hypothesized that their lower melanoma risk may result from eumelanin intermediates and polymers absorbing ROS and functioning as in vivo antioxidants. A predominantly pheomelanotic cell would lack these antioxidants and be prone to higher levels of oxidative damage24,25. To determine if ROS-mediated oxidative DNA damage is affected by the pheomelanin synthesis pathway, levels of 8,5′-cyclo-2′-deoxyadenosine (cdA) and 8,5′-cyclo-2′-deoxyguanosine (cdG) were measured in DNA isolated from skin of redhead-Mc1re/e and albino-Mc1re/e mice, using a previously reported LC-tandem mass spectrometric method26 (FIG. 4c). These two cyclopurines are typically produced by ROS and are quite stable27,28. Additionally, because their formation is inhibited under aerobic conditions, these lesions are unlikely to be artificially induced during DNA isolation and sample preparation, making them excellent markers for oxidative stress28. Significantly, replication studies in E. coli have shown that S-cdA and S-cdG can lead to A to T and G to A mutations at frequencies of 11% and 20%, respectively29. Comparing cyclopurine levels in the skin from various pigmentation variant mice, it was found that the levels of both diastereomers of cdA and cdG are significantly higher in redhead-Mc1re/e as compared to albino-Mc1re/e skin (FIG. 4d-4e). This observation indicates that activation of the pheomelanin synthesis pathway results in increased oxidative DNA damage. Correlative evidence for increased cellular oxidative stress was also found in the observation that redhead-Mc1re/e mouse skin also carries higher levels of lipid peroxides, a product of ROS-mediate lipid damage (FIG. 4f) The findings reported here indicate that in the context of oncogenic BRAF activation, individuals carrying redhead MC1R polymorphisms have an increased risk of melanoma, due to both poor protection from environmental carcinogens like UV radiation, and also via intrinsic carcinogenic features of pheomelanin synthesis; potentially via pheomelanin itself, an intermediate of pigment synthesis or a by-product of the pathway. In humans, there are multiple MC1R polymorphisms with varied perturbation of receptor function that produce a redhead phenotype, however, a unifying feature of these various polymorphisms is a high pheomelanin to eumelanin ratio, which is also produced by the Mc1re/e allele in mouse. Since black mice carry both pheomelanin and eumelanin and yet are relatively protected against melanoma development, pheomelanin within the context of abundant eumelanin is likely to be significantly less toxic, perhaps via quenching of ROS by eumelanin. Studies by Ito et al have found that the reaction kinetics of pigment synthesis initially generates only pheomelanin, until the sulfhydryl donors within melanosomes are depleted. Subsequently if the pathway is adequately activated, eumelanin is produced. The implication of this work may be that eumelanin surrounds pheomelanin in the melanosome thereby dampening its potential toxic effects30. It will be of interest to determine whether topical forskolin, which induces eumelanin synthesis in redhead mouse may alter the melanoma risk in this model19. Of particular interest will be future studies investigating the role of UV in the context of our BRAF(V600E) pigmentation variants. Recent data from Noonan et al intriguingly demonstrated that UV irradiated black animals over-expressing HGF are at higher risk of melanoma than their albino counterparts18. While the present study revealed a small difference between black and albino BRAF(V600E) driven melanomas in the presence of K14-SCF (FIG. 1d), the effect did not reach statistical significance (p=0.1455). It seems likely that the effects of pigmentation and UV radiation are likely to synergize and exacerbate melanoma risk. The photometer used for our lab's routine calibration (International Light 1400) was unable to detect any measurable UV radiation in our mouse cages during ambient light exposure. Thus if UV radiation were contributing to the carcinogenic effects seen, the redhead phenotype would have exhibited a sensitivity profoundly more severe than previously suspected for UV exposure. However, strong epidemiological work, including the typical localization of MC1Re/e melanoma to intermittently sun-exposed skin, links UV radiation to melanoma, and the current data do not diminish the importance of sun exposure as a key contributing factor to melanoma risk1. In humans, it is likely the UV-independent effects are acting in concert with UV-mediated cellular toxicity. In agreement with published studies, UV radiation at a UVA/UVB ratio similar to that found in sunlight (10 J/cm2 UVA and 0.65 J/cm2 UVB) was found to exacerbate oxidative damage selectively in redhead mouse skin as measured by levels of lipid peroxidation4,5 (FIG. 8a). Studies are underway to investigate whether UV radiation is able to alter the redhead-BRafV600E tumor phenotype. A recent paper has suggested that visible light is also able to induce ROS in skin31. Preliminary studies examining the effect of a similar high intensity dose of visible light (180 J/cm2) as used in this paper, did not significantly alter lipid peroxidation levels in any pigmentation context (p=0.4506). Perhaps, however, there is a trend towards an increased level of lipid peroxidation in the redhead skin (FIG. 8b). Further evidence suggesting a UV-independent redhead melanoma risk is the observation that while darker-skinned individuals have a significantly lower risk of melanoma than lighter-skinned individuals, the sun protective factor (SPF, a measurement of sunburn protection) of darker skin has been eMC1Rated at only in the range of SPF 2.0-4.032. In addition, sunscreen (typically SPF 20-40) has exhibited weak efficacy in protecting against melanoma, unlike its protection against cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma33,34. There are numerous potential explanations for the sunscreen-melanoma data, including insufficient follow-up, inadequate UVA shielding, and insufficient topical applications. However it is also possible that UV shielding may protect against only one of several carcinogenic mechanisms—with the intrinsic pheomelanin pathway representing another contributor to melanomagenesis via UV-independent means. While UV shielding remains extremely important for skin cancer prevention, its role in specifically protecting against melanoma may be only partial. Additional preventative strategies may be essential to optimally diminish melanoma risk in the most susceptible individuals.
