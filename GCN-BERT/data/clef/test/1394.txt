FIELD The present invention relates to polymer nanoparticles with a low polydispersity and a photo-induced process for the preparation of such polymer nanoparticles. The present invention further relates to novel photoinitiators suitable for carrying out said process. BACKGROUND Polymer particles are widely used as coating, adhesive, ink and painting materials, for precision mold constructions and the manufacture of micro-sized materials. The unique properties of micro- and nanoscaled polymer particles with low polydispersities have meanwhile gained significant attention not only in the electronics industry, for example, in the manufacture of TFT and LCD displays, digital toners and e-paper, but also in the medical sector such as for drug delivery systems, diagnostic sensors, contrast agents and many other fields of industry. Polymer nanoparticles are frequently synthesized by physical methods such as the evaporation of polymer solution droplets or by the direct synthesis of the nanoparticles using special polymerisation processes. The most common processes are radical polymerisations such as suspension polymerizations and emulsion polymerizations. Over the last decades, a number of radical polymerization processes were developed in order to achieve a better control over the polymerisation process and thus the properties of the resulting polymer nanoparticles. S. Nozari et al. (Macromolecules 2005, 38, 10449) describes a RAFT (reversible addition fragmentation transfer) emulsion polymerization process for the preparation of polystyrene nanoparticles using dithioic acids as sur-iniferters, thereby obtaining polystyrene with an polydispersity index (Mw/Mn), hereinafter also referred to as M-PDI, of 1.22 to 1.31, and a weight average molar mass of 110 to 170 kg/mol. Emulsion polymerisations induced by X-ray radiation are described in S. Wang, X. Wang, Z. Zhang, Eur. Polym. J., 2007, 43, 178. Emulsion polymerisations induced by UV/Vis radiation are described in P. Kuo, N. Turro, Macromolekules 1987, 20, 1216-1221, wherein the formation of polystyrene nanoparticles having a M-PDI of 1.6 to 2.2 and a weight average molecular weight of 500 kg/mol or less. The industrial applicability of the processes described above is, however, hampered due to the use of toxic, expensive, coloured or malodorant chemicals such as heavy metal salts, sulphur containing compounds and stable radicals such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO). SUMMARY An aspect of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of polymer nanoparticles having a low polydispersity while simultaneously allowing for the easy control of the particle size.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The scope of the present invention encompasses all combinations of substituent definitions, parameters and illustrations set forth above and below, either in general or within areas of the listed examples or embodiments, with one another, i.e., also any combinations between the particular areas and areas listed. Whenever used herein the terms “including”, “e.g.”, “such as” and “like” are meant in the sense of “including but without being limited to” or “for example without limitation”, respectively. The term “polymer nanoparticles” denotes polymer nanoparticles comprising at least 50 wt.-%, for example, at least 80 wt.-%, or for example, at least 90 wt.-% of a polymer and having an average particle size of 1 to 10,000 nm, for example, 5 to 1,000 nm, or for example, 10 to 200 nm or 10 to 100 nm. In an embodiment of the present invention, the term “polymer nanoparticles” denotes polymer nanoparticles consisting of a polymer having an average particle size as defined above. The average particle size as used herein is defined as being the particle size (z average) measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS), which is also known as photon correlation spectroscopy (PSC) or quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS). The particle size measured thereby is also frequently called hydrodynamic diameter and reflects how a particle diffuses within a fluid. The measured hydrodynamic diameter is equivalent to that of an ideal sphere having the same translational diffusion coefficient as the particle being measured. Since the surface structure may have a significant influence, the hydrodynamic diameter measured using DLS can be significantly larger than the true diameter measured e.g. by electron microscopy. In Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), the polydispersity index (PDI) reflects the width of the particle size distribution. It ranges from 0 to 1. A value of zero refers to an ideal suspension with no distribution in size. Distributions with PDI values of 0.1 or smaller are called monodisperse while dispersions with values between 0.1 and 0.3 are considered as having a narrow size distribution. Dispersions having a PDI larger than 0.5 are considered being polydisperse. Results referred to herein were obtained using a Zetasizer 3000 of Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK with a fixed scattering angle of 90°. To distinguish the particle size PDI obtained by DLS from the polydispersity index reflecting the molecular mass distribution of a polymer sample (Mw/Mn), the former is abbreviated as “DLS-PDI” and the latter as “M-PDI”. As used herein, and unless specifically stated otherwise, C6-C14-aryl denotes carbocyclic aromatic substituents, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, phenanthrenyl and anthracenyl, whereby said carbocyclic, aromatic substituents are unsubstituted or substituted by up to five identical or different substituents per cycle.

In step A), an emulsion is prepared, whereby the emulsion comprises at least one surfactant, a dispersed phase and a continuous phase, whereby the dispersed phase comprises one or more polymerizable monomers and the continuous phase comprises water and one or more photoinitiators. The preparation of the emulsion is typically effected by simply mixing the components and introducing mixing energy e.g. by standard agitators and/or static mixing elements, whereby the latter are particularly useful in flow-through reactors. Even though not typically necessary, the mixing can be supported by using high force dispersion devices such as, for example, ultrasound sonotrodes or high pressure homogenizers. Step A), the preparation of the emulsion or step B) the polymerization or both steps A) and B) may either be performed batchwise or continuously. The continuous phase comprises water and at least one photoinitiator and may further comprise water miscible solvents.

Suitable water miscible organic solvents include aliphatic alcohols, glycols, ethers, glycol ethers, pyrrolidines, N-alkylpyrrolidinones, N-alkyl pyrrolidones, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, amides, carboxylic acids, esters, sulfoxides, sulfones, hydroxyether derivatives such as butyl carbitol or cellosolve, amino alcohols, ketones, and the like, as well as derivatives thereof and mixtures thereof, provided, however, that they are miscible with water in any ratio. Specific examples include methanol, ethanol, propanol, dioxane, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol, dipropylene glycol or mixtures thereof. The addition of water miscible organic solvents might be useful in those cases where the used amount of photoinitiator is either insoluble or incompletely soluble in water or the water-surfactant mixture. In an embodiment of the present invention, the solubility of hydrophobic polymerizable monomers within the aqueous continuous phase can be typically raised so that the reaction rate, the particle size and the average molecular weight can be influenced by the added amount of water miscible organic solvent. In an embodiment of the present invention, the addition of water miscible organic solvents allows the reaction temperature to be lowered significantly below the freezing point of water or the water-surfactant mixture. In an embodiment of the present invention, the continuous phase comprises less than 20 wt-% of water-miscible organic solvents, for example, less than 10 wt-%, for example, less than 5 wt-% or less than 2 wt.-%. In an aspect of the present invention, the continuous phase does not contain water-miscible organic solvents. In an embodiment of the present invention, the solubility of hydrophilic polymerizable monomers within the aqueous continuous phase can, for example, optionally be lowered by adding soluble salts such as inorganic salts like sodium chloride and the like. The content of inorganic salts may then be, for example, 0.1 to 5 wt.-%, or, for example, 0.1 to 1 wt.-%.

In an embodiment of the present invention, the polymerizable monomer or the mixture of polymerizable monomers can be used in an amount that the content of the polymerizable monomer or the mixture of polymerizable monomers in the continuous phase is less than 50 g/l, for example, less than 25 g/l, or for example, less than 10 g/l or less than 2 g/l. In an embodiment of the present invention, the polymerizable monomer or the mixture of polymerizable monomers can be selected from those resulting in polymer nanoparticles having a glass transition temperature or a melting point or melting range higher than the polymerization temperature in order to avoid immediate agglomeration. The weight ratio of photoinitiator to polymerizable monomer is typically between 1:5 and 1:100.000, for example, between 1:10 and 1:10.000 and for example, 1:50 to 1:1,000. In step A), the photoinitiator may be either added completely or partially. If in step A) the photoinitiator is added partially, the rest can be added during step B) either batchwise or continuously. The emulsion further comprises at least one surfactant. Suitable surfactants are, for example, non-ionic, cationic or anionic or amphoteric surfactants. Surfactants can, for example, be anionic surfactants such as C6-C24-alkyl sulfonates, C6-C24-perfluoroalkyl sulfonates C6-C24-alkyl ether sulfonates, C7-C24-aryl alkyl sulfonates, C6-C24-alkyl aryl sulfonates, C1-C24-alkyl succinates, C1-C24-alkyl sulfo succinates, N—(C1-C24-alkyl)-sarkosinate, acyltaurates, C6-C24-perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, C6-C24-alkyl phosphates, C6-C24-alkyl ether phosphates, C6-C24-alkyl ether carboxylates, in particular the alkali metal, ammonium-, and organic ammonium salts of the aforementioned compounds and cationic surfactants such as quaternary ammonium salts or pyridinium salts.

The CMC is defined as being the lowest concentration of surfactant at which micelle formation is observed and which is dependent on the nature of the surfactant used. The weight ratio of the aqueous continuous phase and the dispersed phase depends on the surface energy and the phase inversion point but is typically between 1:2 and 500:1, for example, between 1.5:1 and 20:1. In step B), the emulsion of step A) is exposed to electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength sufficient to induce the generation of radicals from the photoinitiator. Upon exposure to said electromagnetic radiation, the photoinitiator molecules typically undergo exitation to the singlet state, electron-spin reversal to the triplet state and defragmentation thereby forming at least two radicals. At least some of these radicals are capable of initiating a radical polymerization of the polymerizable monomers. For the photoinitiators according to formula I, the radical formation is typically induced by exposure to electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength of below 500 nm, for example, below 450 nm, for example, in the range of 200 to 450 nm, such as in the range of 300 to 440 nm. As a consequence, suitable sources of electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength sufficient to induce the generation of radicals from the photoinitiator include eximer lasers such as KrF and XeF-lasers; UV lamps like medium-pressure, super-high-pressure, high-pressure and low-pressure mercury lamps which can be undoped or doped e.g. with gallium iodide, thallium iodide or other metal halides; blue or white LEDs; concentrated, direct or indirect sunlight; xenon or xenon mercury arc lamps such as continuous-output xenon short- or long-arc lamps, xenon or xenon mercury flash lamps or other flash lamps; microwave-excited metal vapour lamps; excimer lamps, superactinic fluorescent tubes; fluorescent lamps; and noble gas incandescent lamps. The determination of a suitable reaction temperature range during polymerization depends on the composition of the aqueous continuous phase, the composition of the dispersed phase and the reaction pressure since freezing or boiling in the emulsion should be avoided. In an embodiment of the present invention, the polymerization according to step B) can, for example, be carried out at a temperature range of from −30° C. to 120° C., for example, from −10 to 80° C. and for example, from 0 to 40° C. In an embodiment of the present invention, the polymerization according to step B) can, for example, be carried out at a pressure range of from 100 hPa to 10 Mpa, for example, from 500 hPa to 1 MPa and for example, from 800 hPa to 1,2 MPa. The reaction can, for example, be carried out under ambient pressure. The pH value of the aqueous continuous phase is typically in the range of 3 to 10, for example, in the range of 5 to 9 calculated on standard conditions. If compounds of formula (I) are used which bear carboxylic acid groups, a pH value above the pKa value of the respective compound of formula (I) can, for example, be used. The exposure to electromagnetic radiation depends on the intensity but typically can, for example, last for is to 24 h, for example, for 10 s to 3 h. In an embodiment of the present invention, the amount of electromagnetic radiation having a wavelength sufficient to induce the generation of radicals can be from 10 J/1 to 500 kJ/1 of the emulsion, for example, 100 J/1 to 50 kJ/1. After the exposure to electromagnetic radiation, the reaction might either continue or not, depending on the remaining polymerizable monomers in the emulsion. In those cases where the polymerization is not finished after the exposure to electromagnetic radiation ends, the reaction mixture is either reacted further e.g. for 1 min to 10 h or terminated immediately of after e.g. 1 min to 10 h by adding radical scavengers such as hydroquinones, diphenyldisulfides, phenothiazine and the like. In an embodiment of the present invention, the polymerization can be terminated after consumption of 60 to 99 wt-% of the polymerizable monomers, for example, after consumption of 65 to 90 wt.-%. In an embodiment of the present invention, the residual polymerizable monomers can be removed from the resulting dispersion by standard stripping or distillation techniques. In an embodiment of the present invention, the process can be carried out using a batch reactor or a flow-through reactor, whereby the reactors allow the irradiation of the emulsion contained therein with electromagnetic radiation. The polymer nanoparticles are obtained via the process according to the present invention as an aqueous suspension. The main advantage of the process according to the present invention is that it allows the efficient synthesis of polymer particles in the nanometer to micrometer range. Unprecedented control over the dispersity of the size and the molecular weight distribution can be achieved. Furthermore, the molecular weight of the individual polymer chains is typically very high. The polymer nanoparticles obtained typically have a M-PDI of 1.00 to 1.50, for example, a M-PDI of 1.02 to 1.40. The polymer nanoparticles further typically have a DLS-PDI of 0.05 to 0.50, for example, a DLS-PDI of 0.10 to 0.30. The molecular weight of the polymer chains within the polymer nanoparticles typically have a weight average molecular mass of more than 500 kg/mol to 5,000 kg/mol, for example, 1,000 kg/mol to 5,000 kg/mol. Therefore, an embodiment of the present invention relates to polymer nanoparticles having a DLS-PDI of 0.05 to 0.50, for example, 0.10 to 0.30 and a M-PDI of 1.00 to 1.50, for example, 1.02 to 1.40 and/or a weight average molecular mass of more than 500 kg/mol to 5,000 kg/mol, for example, 1,000 kg/mol to 5,000 kg/mol. In an embodiment of the present invention, polymer suspensions comprise 0.001 to 50 wt-%, for example, 0.001 to 25 wt-% and for example, 0.5 to 20 wt-% of the aforementioned polymer nanoparticles. The polymer nanoparticles can be concentrated in or isolated from the dispersions using standard techniques well known to those skilled in the art. For example, inorganic salts or solutions thereof are added to the suspension and the resulting mixture can be subjected to centrifugation, sedimentation, filtration or other separation processes of a like nature. In an embodiment of the present invention, the concentration or isolation can be performed by nano- or microfiltration using membranes. In an embodiment of the present invention, the aforementioned polymer suspensions or polymer nanoparticles can be used, for example, in coating, adhesive, ink, and painting materials, precision mold constructions, in the manufacture of electronic articles, for drug delivery systems, diagnostic sensors and contrast agents. An aspect of the present invention therefore provides coatings, adhesives, inks, and painting materials, precision mold constructions, electronic articles, drug delivery systems, diagnostic sensors and contrast agents comprising the polymer nanoparticles according to the present invention. The present invention is further illustrated by the examples without being limited thereby.
