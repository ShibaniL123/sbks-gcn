Process for the preparation of an aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate and its use The invention relates to the field a process producing aqueous earth alkali hydrogen carbonate solution and the use of such solutions. Calcium carbonate is used extensively in the paper industry as a filler component in paper. It is a low cost, high brightness filler used to increase sheet brightness and opacity. Its use has increased dramatically in the last decades due to the conversion from acid to alkaline papermaking at paper mills. Both natural and synthetic calcium carbonates are used in the paper industry. Natural carbonate, or limestone, is ground to a small particle size prior to its use in paper, while synthetic calcium carbonate is manufactured by a precipitation reaction and is therefore called precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC). Besides its use in the papermaking industry, precipitated calcium carbonate is also used for various other purposes, e.g. as filler or pigment in the paint industries, and as functional filler for the manufacture of plastic materials, plastisols, sealing compounds, printing inks, rubber, toothpaste, cosmetics, food, pharmaceuticals etc. Precipitated calcium carbonate exists in three primary crystalline forms: calcite, aragonite and vaterite, and there are many different polymorphs (crystal habits) for each of these crystalline forms. Calcite has a trigonal structure with typical crystal habits such as scalenohedral (S-PCC), rhombohedral (R-PCC), hexagonal prismatic, pinacoidal, colloidal (C-PCC), cubic, and prismatic (P-PCC). Aragonite is an orthorhombic structure with typical crystal habits of twinned hexagonal prismatic crystals, as well as diverse assortment of thin elongated prismatic, curved bladed, steep pyramidal, chisel shaped crystals, branching tree, and coral or worm-like form. Usually, PCC is prepared by introducing CO2 into an aqueous suspension of calcium hydroxide, the so-called milk of lime Ca(OH)2 + C02 CaC03 + H20. There are numerous patent applications known to the person skilled in the art that describe the preparation of precipitated calcium carbonate. One of them is ΕΡ 1 966 092 Β1, where the obtained precipitated calcium carbonate is only a byproduct of the sequestration of CO2. Another one is WO 2010/12691, this document disclosing the production of PCC by the addition of an earth alkali hydroxide to water that contains earth alkali ions. International Patent Application WO 2006/008242 Al, for example, describes the production of high purity calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate from a feedstock comprising a Ca- or Mg-comprising mixed metal oxide, wherein the feedstock is contacted with a CO2 containing gas in order to sequestrate the CO2 and in a further step the high purity calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate is precipitated from the aqueous solution that resulted from contacting the feedstock with the CO2. In addition to the above-mentioned fields, calcium carbonate can also be used in the field of the treatment and mineralization of water. Drinking water has become scarce. Even in countries that are rich in water, not all sources and reservoirs are suitable for the production of drinking water, and many sources of today are threatened by a dramatic deterioration of the water quality. Initially feed water used for drinking purposes was mainly surface water and groundwater. However the treatment of seawater, brine, brackish waters, waste waters and contaminated effluent waters is gaining more and more importance for environmental and economic reasons. In order to recover water from seawater or brackish water, for potable usages, several processes are known, which are of considerable importance for dry areas, coastal regions and sea islands, and such processes comprise distillation, electrolytic as well as osmotic or reverse osmotic processes. The water obtained by such processes is very soft and has a low pH value because of the lack of pH-buffering salts, and thus, tends to be highly reactive and unless treated, it can create severe corrosion difficulties during its transport in conventional pipelines. Furthermore, untreated desalinated water cannot be used directly as a source of drinking water. To prevent the dissolution of undesirable substances in pipeline systems, to avoid the corrosion of water works such as pipes and valves and to make the water palatable, it is necessary to mineralize the water. Conventional processes that are mainly used for the mineralization of water are lime dissolution by carbon dioxide and limestone bed filtration. Other, less common remineralization processes, comprise, e.g., the addition of hydrated lime and sodium carbonate, the addition of calcium sulfate and sodium bicarbonate, or the addition of calcium chloride and sodium bicarbonate. The lime process involves treatment of lime solution with CO2 acidified water, wherein the following reaction is involved: Ca(OH)2 + 2 C02 -> Ca2+ + 2 HC03 As can be gathered from the above reaction scheme, two equivalents of CO2 are necessary to convert one equivalent of Ca(OH)2 into Ca2+ and bicarbonate for remineralization. This method is dependent on the addition of two equivalents of CO2 in order to convert the alkaline hydroxide ions into the buffering species HCO3". For the remineralization of water, a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, commonly named lime water, of 0.1 - 0.2 wt.-% based on the total weight, is prepared from a lime milk (usually at most 5 wt.-%). Therefore, a saturator to produce the lime water must be used and large volumes of lime water are necessary to achieve the target level of remineralization. A further drawback of this method is that hydrated lime is corrosive and requires appropriate handling and specific equipment. Furthermore, a poorly controlled addition of hydrated lime to the soft water can lead to unwanted pH shifts due to the absence of buffering properties of lime. The limestone bed filtration process comprises the step of passing the soft water through a bed of granular limestone dissolving the calcium carbonate in the water flow. Contacting limestone with CO2 acidified water mineralizes the water according to: CaC03 + C02 + H20 -> Ca2+ + 2 HC03 Unlike the lime process, only one equivalent of CO2 is stochiometrically necessary to convert one equivalent of CaCC>3 into Ca2+ and bicarbonate for remineralization. Moreover, limestone is not corrosive and due to the buffering properties of CaCC>3 major pH shifts are prevented. One additional advantage of the use of calcium carbonate compared to lime is its very low carbon dioxide footprint. In order to produce one tonne of calcium carbonate 75 kg of CO2 is emitted, whereas 750 kg of CO2 is emitted for the production of one tonne of lime. Therefore, the use of earth alkali carbonates such marble, dolomite or only have burned dolomite instead of lime presents some environmental benefits. The dissolution rate of granular calcium carbonate, however, is slow and filters are required for this process. This induces a sizeable footprint of these filters and large plant surfaces are required for the limestone bed filtration systems. Methods for remineralization of water using lime milk or a slurry of lime are described in US 7,374, 694 and ΕΡ 0 520826. US 5,914,046 describes a method for reducing the acidity in effluent discharges using a pulsed limestone bed. WO 2010/12691 discloses a process for the treatment of water containing at least calcium and/or magnesium salts through membranes of reverse osmosis typ. The process comprises at least one step of recovering water that is at least partly desalinated, a step of recovering a concentrate originating from the membranes and that contains bicarbonates, a step of injecting CO2 or an acid into the at least partially desalinated water, and a step of remineralization of the at least partially desalinated water. The CO2 is added to the bicarbonate solution in order to decarbonate the concentrate and to form agglomerates of calcium carbonates out of the bicarbonates. The applicant also knows the following unpublished European Patent Applications in the field of water treatment. European Patent Application 11 175 012.1 describes a method for the remineralization of desalinated and fresh water containing a certain carbon dioxide level by injecting a micronized calcium carbonate slurry in feed water. European Patent Application 10 172 771.7 describes a method for the remineralization of desalinated and fresh water by injecting a micronized calcium carbonate slurry. Finally, European Patent Application 11 179 541.5 describes a method for the remineralization of water by combining a calcium carbonate solution and feed water. In the three unpublished European Patent Applications of the field of water treatment no indication is given about the specific surface area (SSA) of the earth alkali carbonates used. From the mean particle size referred to in the examples of these patent applications it is not possible to calculate the specific surface area (SSA) of the corresponding products. No indication is given with regard to the influence of the specific surface area (SSA) on an efficient production of an earth alkali hydrogen carbonate solution. Thus, considering the drawbacks of the known processes for mineralization or remineralization of water, it is the object of the present invention to provide an alternative and improved process for mineralization of water. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for mineralization of water that does not require a corrosive compound, and thus, avoids the danger of incrustation, eliminates the need for corrosion resistant equipment, and provides a safe environment for people working in the plant. It would also be desirable to provide a process that is environmental friendly and requires low amounts of carbon dioxide when compared to today’s water reminerlization with lime processes.

Advantageous embodiments of the present invention are defined in the corresponding sub-claims. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the particles of the resulting suspension S represent a total particle surface area (SSAtotai) that is in the range of 25 000 - 5 000 000 m2/tonne, more preferably in the range of 50 000 - 2 000 000 m2/tonne, most preferably in the range of 200 000 - 600 000 m2/tonne of the resulting suspension S.

The unit is m2/g. The term “total particle surface area (SSAtotai)” in the meaning of the present invention describes the total surface area per tonne of suspension S. According to another embodiment, the at least one substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide of step b) is selected from the group comprising marble, limestone, chalk, half burnt lime, burnt lime, dolomitic limestone, calcareous dolomite, half burnt dolomite, burnt dolomite, and precipitated earth alkali carbonates such as precipitated calcium carbonate, for example of calcitic, aragonitic and/or vateritic mineral crystal structure, for example from water de-hardening by the addition of Ca(OH)2. The use of marble, limestone, chalk and dolomite is preferred because they are naturally occurring minerals and the turbidity of the final drinking water quality is guaranteed by using a clear aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate that is produced using these naturally occurring minerals. Natural marble deposits are mostly containing acid and/or water insoluble silicate impurities. However, such acid and/or water insoluble, sometimes colored silicates do not affect the final water quality with respect of turbidity when using the product that is prepared by the inventive process. In addition, suspensions or solutions prepared by using naturally occurring minerals such as marble, limestone, chalk or dolomite are containing essential healthy trace elements improving the quality of drinking water. The at least one earth alkali hydroxide is preferably calcium hydroxide and/or magnesium hydroxide. Due to the fact of very low solubility of Mg(OH)2 in water compared to Ca(OH)2 the speed of reaction of Mg(OH)2 with CO2 is very limited and in presence of Ca(OH)2 in suspension the reaction of CO2 with Ca(OH)2 is very much preferred. Surprisingly, by using the inventive process it is possible to produce Mg(HCC>3)2 rich earth alkali hydrogen carbonate suspension also in presence of Ca(OH)2 in the suspension.

CO2 can also be produced by reacting an alkali- and/or earth alkali carbonate with acid. When a gaseous mixture of carbon dioxide and at least one other gas is used, then the carbon dioxide is present in the range of 8 to about 99% by volume, and preferably in the range of 10 to 25% by volume, for example 20% by volume. According to a very preferred embodiment, the CO2 is pure gaseous CO2 with a purity of > 99 %, e.g. a purity of > 99.9%. In the light of an ecological concept, it is desirable to follow as far as possible the Kyoto protocol on the reduction of combustion of petrochemical sources and to reduce petrochemical derived CO2 so that the CO2 used for the process has a 14C to 12C decay of at least 500, more preferred at least 800, most preferred at least 900 decay per h and per g of C in the CO2. Following the Kyoto protocol, it is also desirable that the electrical power used in the process of the present invention is derived from solar power, for example from thermal and/or voltammetry solar panels. In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention following the Kyoto protocol, the amount of CO2 used, in mol, to produce 1 mol of the at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate in the aqueous solution is in the range of only 0.5 to 4 mol, preferably in the range of only 0.5 to 2.5 mol, more preferably in the range of only 0.5 to 1.0 mol, and most preferably in the range of only 0.5 to 0.65 mol. According to another preferred embodiment of the invention the aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate that is obtained in step ℮) has a hardness from 5 to 130 °dH, preferably from 10 to 60 °dH, and most preferably from 15 to 50 °dH. For the purpose of the present invention the hardness refers to the German hardness and is expressed in “degree German hardness, °dH”. In this regard, the hardness refers to the total amount of earth alkali ions in the aqueous solution comprising the earth alkali hydrogen carbonate, and it is measured by complexometric titration at pH 10 using ethylene-diamine-tetra-actetic acid (EDTA) and Eriochrome Τ as equivalent point indicator. The aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate and that is obtained in step ℮) has preferably a pH in the range of 6.5 to 9, preferably in the range of 6.7 to 7.9, and most preferably in the range of 6.9 to 7.7, at 20°C.

According to still another embodiment of the present invention the aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate and that is obtained in step ℮) has a turbidity value of lower than 1.0 NTU, preferably of lower than 0.5 NTU, and most preferably of lower than 0.3 NTU. It is preferred that at least step d) is carried out at a temperature that is in a range of 5 to 55°C, and preferably in a range of 20 to 45°C. According to an even more preferred embodiment of the present invention the aqueous solution obtained in step ℮) comprises: (χ) a calcium hydrogen carbonate, preferably with a calcium concentration of 25 to 150 mg/1, as calcium carbonate, or (χχ) a magnesium hydrogen carbonate, preferably with a magnesium concentration of > 0 to 50 mg/1, or (χχχ) a mixture of a calcium and a magnesium hydrogen carbonate, preferably in a total calcium and magnesium concentration of 25 to 200 mg/1, as calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate.

In the meaning of the present invention burned dolomite comprises calcium oxide (CaO) and magnesium oxide (MgO), whereas half burnt dolomite comprises Mg in the form of magnesium oxide (MgO) and Ca in the form of calcium carbonate (CaCCh), but can also include some minor amount of calcium oxide (CaO). In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the process is a continuous process. However, the process of the present invention can also be carried out in a semi-batch mode. In this case, the resulting suspension S can, for example, represent a total particle surface area (SSAtotai) that is around 1 000 000 m2/tonne and is subjected to the process of the present invention. Then, the product, i.e. the aqueous solution of the earth alkali hydrogen carbonate, is discharged from the process until the remaining resulting suspension S represents a total particle surface area (SSAtotai) that is > 20 000 m2/tonne, and then a new amount of the at least one substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide in a minor amount in respect to the earth alkali carbonate is introduced into the process. It is noted that the total particle surface can be determined during each point of the continuous process by determining the specific surface area (SSA) of the suspension S as well as the dry content of the suspension S. Most preferably, the continuous process is controlled by the amount of discharged aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate and the measurement of the solid content of suspension S or by complexometric titration or by measurement of the conductivity of the earth alkali hydrogen carbonate solution. In yet another embodiment of the present invention the filtering device of step ℮) is a membrane filter, such as for example a microfiltration and/or an ultrafiltration membrane.

A further object of the present invention is the use of an aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate obtained by the inventive process for the production of a precipitated earth alkali carbonate and/or hydromagnesite, and in particular for the production of a precipitated calcium carbonate and/or hydro magnesite. Such precipitated earth alkali carbonates, and in particular a precipitated calcium carbonate and hydromagnesite are useful as fillers in many industrial applications, for example as fillers in paper, paint or plastic. Another object of the present invention is the use of an aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate obtained by the inventive process for the mineralization of water. A further object of the present invention is a process for the mineralization of water comprising the following steps: I) providing feed water, II) providing an aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate, and III) combining the feed water of step I) and the aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate of step II) in order to obtain mineralized water. According to one embodiment of the process for the mineralization of water the aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate of step II) has a hardness that is at least 3 °dH, and preferably at least 5 °dH higher than the hardness of the feed water of step I). According to a preferred embodiment the aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate of step II) has a hardness of at least 15 °dH. According to another embodiment of the process for the mineralization of water the mineralized water has a calcium concentration, as calcium carbonate, from 1 to 700 mg/1, preferably from 50 to 650 mg/1, and most preferably from 70 to 630 mg/1. According to yet another embodiment of the process for the mineralization of water the mineralized water has a magnesium concentration, as magnesium carbonate, from 1 to 200 mg/1, preferably from 2 to 150 mg/1, and most preferably from 3 to 125 mg/1. An even further object of the present invention is a process for the production of a precipitated earth alkali carbonate, the process comprising the following steps: IV) providing an aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate, and V) heating the aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate of step IV) in order to obtain the precipitated earth alkali carbonate, and/or VII) adding at least one earth alkali hydroxide or earth alkali oxide to the solution of step IV) to obtain the precipitated earth alkali carbonate. By heating the aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate, water is evaporated from the solution and upon a certain point of time the earth alkali carbonate starts to precipitate out of the solution. According to a preferred embodiment of the process for the production of a precipitate earth alkali carbonate, the precipitated earth alkali carbonate is selected from among an amorphous earth alkali carbonate, such as amorphous calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate, crystalline calcium carbonate in the calcitic, the aragonitic or the vateritic form, magnesite and hydromagnesite, or is a mixture of the aforementioned. “Conductivity” in the meaning of the present invention is used as an inverse indicator of how salt-free, ion-free, or impurity-free the measured water is; the purer the water, the lower the conductivity. The conductivity can be measured with a conductivity meter and is specified in S/m. “Ground calcium carbonate (GCC)” in the meaning of the present invention is a calcium carbonate obtained from natural sources including marble, chalk or limestone, and processed through a treatment such as grinding, screening and/or fractionizing by wet and/or dry, for example, by a cyclone. “Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC)” in the meaning of the present invention is a synthesized material, generally obtained by precipitation following the reaction of carbon dioxide and lime in an aqueous environment or by precipitation of a calcium and carbonate source in water or by precipitation of calcium and carbonate ions, for example CaCf and Na2CC>3, out of solution. Precipitated calcium carbonate exists in three primary crystalline forms: calcite, aragonite and vaterite, and there are many different polymorphs (crystal habits) for each of these crystalline forms. Calcite has a trigonal structure with typical crystal habits such as scalenohedral (S-PCC), rhombohedral (R-PCC), hexagonal prismatic, pinacoidal, colloidal (C-PCC), cubic, and prismatic (P-PCC). Aragonite is an orthorhombic structure with typical crystal habits of twinned hexagonal prismatic crystals, as well as a diverse assortment of thin elongated prismatic, curved bladed, steep pyramidal, chisel shaped crystals, branching tree, and coral or worm-like forms. Throughout the present document, the “particle size” of a calcium carbonate product is described by its distribution of particle sizes. The value dx represents the diameter relative to which χ % by weight of the particles have diameters less than dx. This means that the djo value is the particle size at which 20 wt.-% of all particles are smaller, and the dis value is the particle size at which 75 wt.-% of all particles are smaller. The dso value is thus the weight median particle size, i.e. 50 wt.-% of all grains are bigger or smaller than this particle size. For the purpose of the present invention the particle size is specified as weight median particle size dso unless indicated otherwise. These values were measured using a Mastersizer 2000 device from the company Malvern Instruments GmbH, Germany. The term “mineralization” as used in the present invention refers to the increase of essential mineral ions in water not containing minerals at all or in insufficient amount to obtain water that is palatable. A mineralization can be achieved by adding at least calcium carbonate to the water to be treated. Optionally, e.g., for health-related benefits or to ensure the appropriate intake of some other essential mineral ions and trace elements, further substances may be mixed to the calcium carbonate and then added to the water during the remineralization process. According to the national guidelines on human health and drinking water quality, the remineralized product may comprise additional minerals containing magnesium, potassium or sodium, e.g., magnesium carbonate, magnesium sulfate, potassium hydrogen carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or other minerals containing essential trace elements. Useful substances for the use in the inventive process for preparing an aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate are natural calcium and/or magnesium carbonate containing inorganic substances or salts, or synthetic calcium and/or magnesium carbonate containing inorganic substances or salts. Useful natural occurring inorganic substances are for example marble, limestone, chalk, dolomitic marble and/or dolomite. Synthetic substances are for example precipitated calcium carbonates in the calcitic, aragonitic and/or vateritic crystalline form. However, natural occurring inorganic substances are preferred because they inherently contain some essential trace elements. “Turbidity” in the meaning of the present invention describes the cloudiness or haziness of a fluid caused by individual particles (suspended solids) that are generally invisible to the naked eye. The measurement of turbidity is a key test of water quality and can be carried out with a nephelometer. The units of turbidity from a calibrated nephelometer as used in the present invention are specified as Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU). The inventive process for the preparation of an aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate comprises the steps of: a) providing water, b) providing at least one substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and optionally at least one earth alkali hydroxide in a minor amount in respect to the earth alkali carbonate, the at least one substance being in a dry form or in an aqueous form, c) providing CO2, d) combining either: (i) the water of step a), the at least one substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide of step b) and the CO2 of step c), or (ii) the water of step a) and the at least one substance comprising at least one earth carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide of step b) in order to obtain an alkaline aqueous suspension of the at least one substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide, and subsequently combining the alkaline aqueous suspension with the CO2 of step c) in order to obtain a resulting suspension S having a pH of between 6 and 9, the resulting suspension S containing particles, ℮) filtering at least a part of the resulting suspension S that is obtained in step d) by passing the resulting suspension S through a filtering device in order to obtain the aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate, wherein the particles of the resulting suspension S that is obtained in step d) represent a total particle surface area (SSAtotai) that is > 20 000 m2/tonne of the resulting suspension S, and with the proviso that an addition of the CO2 of step c) does not take place before an addition of the at least one substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide of step b). The process according to the present invention is preferably carried out in a reactor system that comprises at least a tank, at least one filtering device, and means connecting the tank and the at least one filtering device, such as pipes or tubes. In addition, the reactor system can also comprise measurement equipment, such as pressure, temperature, pH, turbidity measuring units, and the like. The tank is equipped with a stirrer, at least one inlet for the water, the carbon dioxide and the substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide. Connected to the tank, there is also a filtering device where at least a part of the resulting suspension S having a pH of between 6 and 9 and that is prepared in the tank is passed through in order to obtain the aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate. Preferably at least a part of the solution leaving the filtering device is collected in order to obtain the aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate. However, if the observed turbidity value of the aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate that exits the filtering device is found to be above 1.0 NTU, then the aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate is re-circulated in the reactor. The water that can be used in the inventive process can be derived from various sources. The water preferably treated by the process of the present invention is desalinated seawater, brackish water or brine, treated wastewater or natural water such as ground water, surface water or rainfall. According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, sea water or brackish water is firstly pumped out of the sea by open ocean intakes or subsurface intakes such as wells, and then it undergoes physical pretreatments such as screening, sedimentation or sand removal process. Depending on the required water quality, additional treatment steps such as coagulation and flocculation may be necessary in order to reduce potential fouling on the membranes. The pretreated seawater or brackish water may then be distilled, e.g., using multiple stage flash, multiple effect distillation, or membrane filtration such as ultrafiltration or reverse osmosis, to remove the remaining particulates and dissolved substances. A flow control valve or other means may be used to control the rate of flow of carbon dioxide into the stream. For example, a CO2 dosing block and a CO2 in-line measuring device may be used to control the rate of the CO2 flow. According to one exemplary embodiment of the invention, the CO2 is injected using a combined unit comprising a CO2 dosing unit, a static mixer and an in-line CO2 measuring device. The carbon dioxide dose is preferably controlled by the pH of the produced aqueous earth alkali hydrogen carbonate solution. The alkaline aqueous suspension formed in the reactor system has a solids content in the range from 0.1 to 80 wt.-%, preferably in the range of 3 to 50 wt.-%, more preferably in the range of 5 to 35 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the resulting suspension S. The substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide that is dosed into the tank can be in a dry form or in an aqueous form. Preferably, the substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide has a weight median particle size (Αο) in the range of 0.1 pm to 50 pm, and preferably in the range of 0.5 pm to 5 pm. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate is preferably a ground calcium carbonate (GCC) such as marble, limestone or chalk; or a dolomite. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide has a HC1 insoluble content from 0.02 to 90 wt.-%, preferably from 0.05 to 15 wt.-%, based on the total weight of the dry substance. The HC1 insoluble content may be, e.g., minerals such as quartz, silicate, mica and/or pyrite. According to yet another embodiment of the present invention, the aqueous suspension of the at least one substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide in a minor amount in respect to earth alkali carbonate, is freshly prepared by mixing the water and the substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide in a minor amount in respect to earth alkali carbonate. The on-site preparation of the aqueous suspension may be preferred since premixed the aqueous suspensions may require the addition of further agents such as stabilizers or biocides, which may be unwanted compounds in the remineralized water. According to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the time period between the preparation of the aqueous suspension and the injection of the aqueous suspension is short enough to avoid bacterial growth in the aqueous suspension. According to one exemplary embodiment, the time period between the preparation of the aqueous suspension and the injection of the aqueous suspension is less than 48 hours, less than 24 hours, less than 12 hours, less than 5 hours, less than 2 hours or less than 1 hour. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the injected aqueous suspension meets the microbiological quality requirements specified by the national guidelines for drinking water. The aqueous suspension of the at least one substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide in a minor amount in respect to earth alkali carbonate can be prepared, for example, using a mixer such as a mechanical stirrer for dilute slurries, or a specific powder-liquid mixing device for more concentrate slurries. Depending on the concentration of the prepared aqueous suspension the mixing time may be from 0.5 to 30 min, from 1 to 20 min, from 2 to 10 min, or from 3 to 5 min. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the aqueous suspension is prepared using a mixing machine, wherein the mixing machine enables simultaneous mixing and dosing of the aqueous suspension. The water used to prepare the aqueous suspension can be, e.g., distilled water, feed water or industrial water. According to one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the water used to prepare the aqueous suspension is feed water, e.g. permeate or distillate obtained from a desalination process. According to one embodiment the aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate is injected directly into a stream of feed water. For example, a clear solution comprising earth alkali hydrogen carbonate can be injected into the feed water stream at a controlled rate by means of a continuous conductivity measurement. According to one embodiment, the predetermined parameter value is a pH value, wherein the pH value is from 6.5 to 9, preferably from 7 to 8. Fig. 1 is meant to illustrate the process according to the present invention. Fig. 1 exemplifies one embodiment of the present invention. The process according to the present invention is preferably carried out in a reactor system that comprises a tank (1) that is equipped with a stirrer (2), at least one inlet (not shown) for the water, the carbon dioxide and the at least substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide as well as a pH measuring device (not shown). The at least one substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide in a minor amount in respect to earth alkali carbonate can be introduced into the tank either in a dry or in an aqueous form. Connected to the reactor, there is at least one filtering device (4) that has an outlet for the aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate. When there is more than one filtering device present, then they can be either arranged in a parallel, or an in-line (serial), or a parallel and an in-line manner. The filtering device (4) is preferably a membrane filter. The filtering device (4) is connected to the tank (1) in such a way that a recirculation of a part of the suspension from the filtering device (4) into the tank (1) is possible, if required. The at least one substance comprising at least one earth alkali carbonate and the optional at least one earth alkali hydroxide (6) in a minor amount in respect to earth alkali carbonate, the water (14) and the CO2 are introduced into the tank (1) via the at least one inlet (not shown) and are stirred with stirrer (2) in order to obtain the resulting suspension S having a pH of between 6 and 9. Then, the resulting suspension S is fed (8) to the filtering device (4), where coarse particles, i.e. all particles having a size of at least 0.2 pm, that are contained in the suspension are retained in the filtering device (4), and a clear aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate is obtained. At least a part of the clear aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate is discharged (10) from the filtering device (4). The flow rate of the suspension S through the filtering device (4) is at least 1 m/s, and preferably in the range of 1.5 to 10 m/s, and most preferably in the range of 3 to 6 m/s. Optionally, further treatments (16) can be carried out, such as for example a mechanical treatment or the addition of biocides or other additives in order to change the pH of the solution (e.g. addition of a base such as NaOH), the conductivity of the solution, or the hardness of the solution. As a further option, the clear aqueous solution comprising at least one earth alkali hydrogen carbonate discharged from the filtering device can be diluted with further water (14). The coarse particles contained in the suspension and that are retained in the filtering device can optionally be recirculated (12) to the reactor in order to be available for further conversion. According to one embodiment the flow rate of the feed water is 20 000 to 500 000 m3 per day. The inventive process may be used to produce drinking water, recreation water such as water for swimming pools, industrial water for process applications, irrigation water, or water for the production of purified earth alkali carbonates. According to one embodiment the earth alkali hydrogen carbonate solution obtained by the inventive process has a calcium concentration from 1 to 700 mg/1, as CaCCfi, preferably from 50 to 650 mg/1, as CaCCfi, and most preferred from 70 to 630 mg/1, as CaCCfi. In case the slurry comprises a further magnesium salt such as magnesium hydrogen carbonate, or magnesium sulfate, the earth alkali hydrogen carbonate solution obtained by the inventive process may have a magnesium concentration from 1 to 200 mg/1, as MgCCfi, preferably from 2 to 150 mg/1, as MgCCfi, and most preferably from 3 to 125 mg/1, as MgCCfi. According to one embodiment of the present invention the earth alkali hydrogen carbonate solution has a turbidity of lower than 1.0 NTU, preferred lower than 0.3 NTU. Examples Specific surface area (SSA) of a material The specific surface area (SSA) was measured using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 (based on the Fraunhofer equation). Particle size distribution (mass % particles with a diameter < X) and weight median diameter (d50) of a particulate material Weight median grain diameter and grain diameter mass distribution of a particulate material were determined using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000 (based on the Fraunhofer equation). pH of an aqueous suspension The pH was measured using a Mettler-Toledo pH meter .The calibration of the pH electrode was performed using standards of pH values 4.01, 7.00 and 9.21. Solids content of an aqueous suspension The suspension solids content (also known as "dry weight") was determined using a Moisture Analyser HR73 from the company Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland, with the following settings: temperature of 120°C, automatic switch off 3, standard drying, 5 to 20 g of suspension. Turbidity The turbidity was measured with a Hach Lange 2100ΑΝ IS Laboratory Turbidimeter and the calibration was performed using StabCal turbidity standards (formazine standards) of < 0.1, 20, 200, 1000, 4000 and 7500 NTU. Determination of the hardness (German hardness; expressed in “°dH”) The hardness refers to the total amount of earth alkali ions in the aqueous solution comprising the earth alkali hydrogen carbonate, and it is measured by complexometric titration using ethylene-diamine-tetra-actetic acid (EDTA; trade name Titriplex III) and Eriochrome Τ as equivalent point indicator. EDTA (chelating agent) forms with the ions Ca2+ and Mg2+ soluble, stable chelate complexes. 2 ml of a 25 % ammonia solution, an ammonia/ammonium acetate buffer (pH 10) and Eriochrome black Τ indicator were added to 100 ml of a water sample to be tested. The indicator and the buffer is usually available as so-called “indicator-buffer tablet”. The indicator, when masked with a yellow dye, forms a red colored complex with the Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. At the end of the titration, that is when all ions are bound by the chelating agent, the remaining Eriochrome black Τ indicator is in its free form which shows a green color. When the indicator is not masked, then the color changes from magenta to blue. The total hardness can be calculated from the amount of EDTA that has been used. The table below shows a conversion for the different units of the water hardness. 11 In this regard the unit ppm is used in the meaning of 1 mg/1 CaCC>3.

The purity was > 99.9 VoL-%. Examples The Prior art examples were prepared in the following wav The prior art examples show different slurries with various concentrations of calcium carbonate which were prepared from different carbonate rocks and dosed to feed water in a batch mode. The feed water was obtained from a reverse osmosis desalination process and was acidified with about 50 mg/1 CO2. The slurries were prepared by mixing an appropriate amount of calcium carbonate with 100 ml feed water at room temperature using a magnetic stirrer, with stirring between 1000 and 1500 rpm and a mixing time of between 3 and 5 min. The remineralization was performed by adding the slurry in small amounts to about one liter of the acidified feed water, wherein the slurry and the feed water were mixed using a magnetic stirrer, with stirring between 1000 and 1500 rpm and a mixing time of 2 minutes. After every slurry addition, a sample was taken from the treated feed water to control the alkalinity, turbidity, conductivity, pH, temperature. A final calcium concentration of 125 mg/1 as CaCCfi was chosen as target for remineralization of the feed water. 125 mg CaCCfi/l represent a concentration of 0.0125 wt.-%. For each sample the turbidity of the remineralized water was measured directly after mixing and after a settling period of minimum 60 minutes. The turbidity measured on the settled samples was performed in order to observe the impact of sedimentation in the remineralization process. The turbidity was measured with a Hach Lange 2100ΑΝ IS Laboratory Turbidimeter and the calibration was performed using StabCal turbidity standards (formazin standards) of < 0.1, 20, 200, 1000, 4000 and 7500 NTU. The total alkalinity was measured with a Mettler-Toledo Τ70 Titrator using the related LabX Light Titration software. A DGil 11-SG pH electrode was used for this titration according to the corresponding Mettler-Toledo method Μ415 of the application brochure 37 (water analysis). The calibration of the pH electrode was performed using Mettler-Toledo standards of pH values 4.01, 7.00 and 9.21. Example 1 - Slurry A Two slurries having a calcium carbonate concentration of 0.5 and 5 wt.-% based on the total weight of the slurry were prepared from marble (Salses, France) derived micronized calcium carbonate having a medium particle size of 3.5 pm and a HC1 insoluble content of 0.2 wt.-% based on the total weight of the calcium carbonate. The results compiled in Table 1 show similar turbidity values for both remineralization processes with 0.5 wt.-% and 5 wt.-% CaCCL slurries. After a settling period, the samples presented turbidity values lower than 0.5 NTU. Example 2 - Slurry Β Three slurries having a calcium carbonate concentration of 0.5, 1 and 10 wt.-% based on the total weight of the slurry were prepared from marble (Bathurst, Australia) derived micronized calcium carbonate having a medium particle size of 2.8 pm and a HC1 insoluble content of 1.5 wt.-% based on the total weight of the calcium carbonate. The results compiled in Table 1 show similar turbidity values for all three remineralization processes. However the turbidity values measured for the settled samples taken after two minutes of remineralization are higher than those of example 1, which may be due to the difference in the HC1 insoluble content of the marble calcium carbonate. Example 3 - Slurry C A slurry having a calcium carbonate concentration of 5 wt.-% based on the total weight of the slurry was prepared from limestone (Orgon, France ) derived micronized calcium carbonate having a medium particle size of 3 pm, a specific surface area (SSA) of 2.6 m2/g, and a HC1 insoluble content of 0.1 wt.-% based on the total weight of the calcium carbonate. The results compiled in Table 1 show that the turbidity value measured for the settled sample is much lower in comparison to the values of example 1 and 2, which may be due to the different geological structures of the carbonate rocks.

Example 4 - Different particle sizes Three slurries having a calcium carbonate concentration of 5 wt.-% based on the total weight of the slurry were prepared from marble derived micronized calcium carbonate having a particle size of 3.5, 9, and 20 pm, respectively, and a HC1 insoluble content of 0.2 wt.-% based on the total weight of the calcium carbonate. The results compiled in Table 2 show that after a settling period the turbidity of the water remineralized with a larger particle size, i.e. 20 pm, has a lower turbidity value in comparison with the turbidity of the water remineralized with smaller particle size, i.e. 3.5 pm what is logic due to the fact that the coarse particles settled much faster versus fine particles. Table 2 Mean particle size (pm) SSA (m2/g) SSA (m2/ m3) Turbidity (NTU) Alkalinity fresh sample (mg/1 CaC03) Fresh sample Settled sample 3.5 2.61 326 9 32 0.45 120 1.75 219 20 22 0.36 78 0.94 118 27 0.31 67 The results compiled in Table 2 show a strong turbidity for the fresh samples. After a settling period he water that was remineralized with a larger particle size, i.e. 20 pm, shows a lower turbidity value compared to the water that was remineralized with a smaller particle size, i.e. 3.5 pm, what is somehow logic due to the fact that coarse particles settle much faster than fine ones, but which will increase the turbidity of the sample immediately if the sample is shaken. Marble based calcium carbonate having a weight median diameter (clso) of 3.5 pm represents approximately a total particle surface of 2.61 m2/g corresponding to 326.3 m2/tonne of suspension at 0.0125 wt.-% solids. Marble based calcium carbonate having a weight median diameter fr/50) of 9 μηΐ represents approximately a total particle surface of 1.75 m2/g corresponding to 218.8 m2/tonne of suspension at 0.0125 wt.-% solids. Marble based calcium carbonate having a weight median diameter (clso) of 20 pm represents approximately a total particle surface of 0.94 m2/g corresponding to 117.5 m2/tonne of suspension at 0.0125 wt.-% solids. It can be derived from the above information that the dissolution rate of calcium carbonate is reduced by the reduced specific surface of the calcium carbonate particles that are present in the suspension. Examples relating to the invention A general process flow sheet of the process according to the present invention is shown in Figure 1. The feed water used in the inventive examples was obtained from an ion exchange equipment of Christ, Aesch, Switzerland Typ Elite 1ΒΤΗ, the feed water having the following water specification after the ion exchanger: Sodium 169 mg/1 Calcium 2 mg/1 Magnesium < 1 mg/1 °dH 0.3 The following different process routes were used to exemplify the process according to the present invention: Process A (Figure 1) The suspension of the reactor passes a mill without grinding beads in the mill. This process is sought to exemplify the embodiment of the invention. Example 5, Microdol A extra (Dolomite!

The suspension had a conductivity of 2 580 pS/cm. The suspension was pumped in circulation mode at a rate of 3200 1/h from the reactor passing a membrane module of 0.2 m2 (Microdyn-Modul MD 063 TP 2Ν) and was then recirculated into the tank. CO2 was dosed after the pump, but before the membrane module. The pump was driven by a mix of solar electrical power (Solarcenter Muntwiler, Switzerland, www.solarcenter.ch) and nuclear power plant. Fig. 2 shows the electric meter of the solar power station that was used to generate the electrical power that was used in this example.

Example 8, Pilot scale trials This examples presents trials for the preparation of aqueous solutions of calcium hydrogen carbonate in pilot scale. The obtained solution of calcium hydrogen carbonate is then used for the remineralization of soft water, which could be for instance natural soft water from ground water or surface water sources, desalinated water from reverse osmosis or distillation, rain water. The trials were performed using different calcium carbonate products as raw material for the preparation of calcium carbonate suspension, hereafter slurries, and the resulting solutions of calcium hydrogen carbonate obtained after the dosing of carbon dioxide. The following Table 5 summarizes the properties of the calcium carbonate used during the remineralization pilot trials with an initial slurry volume of 1200 L. 11 It has to be noted that all of the above listed calcium carbonates arc commercially available from Omya, Switzerland.

The RO water was produced on-site using a reverse osmosis unit and had the average quality as outlined in the following Table 7. Table 7 pH Conductivity (qS/cm) Turbidity (NTU) RO water 6.4-6.6 10-25 <0.1 The tank was filled up completely with the respective calcium carbonate suspension. Then, the calcium carbonate suspension was pumped from the tank towards the mill (without grinding beads in the mill), and from there to the membrane filtering device for filtration. The mill was used as dosing point for the carbon dioxide that is required for the dissolution of the calcium carbonate into the water. The obtained dissolved hydrogen carbonate then passed through the membrane, while the undissolved calcium carbonate was fed back to the tank. Amongst different water parameters, the conductivity was used as a proxy for measuring the amount of dissolved hydrogen carbonate obtained by this process. The conditions for the carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate dosing can be derived from Table 8.

Continuous testing period It is believed that the inventive process requires time to reach a steady-state, therefore long testing period have been initiated with a testing period from 10 to 22 days. The surface area of the solids present in the slurry has a direct impact on the dissolution of the calcium carbonate into the water and therefore on the final concentration of the dissolved hydrogen carbonate, measured as final conductivity. The results presented in Table 11 were performed using two slurries made of different products. The slurry 3 contains the coarser product (Sample C: c/50 = 7.8 pm, SSA =1.7 m2/g) and the slurry 4 the finer product (Sample D: c/50 = 4.3 pm, SSA = 2.3 m2/g). Both slurries have a different the solid content, 2 wt.-% for slurry 3 and 7 wt.-% for slurry 4, respectively. The tests were performed using the same CO2 dosing ratio of 0.3 L CO2/ L concentrate and the results present the values obtained at the end of 8 days of testing when the system can be considered to have reached a steady-state.
