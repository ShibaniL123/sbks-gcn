FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising (i) 50% to 99% of doxycycline and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as an immediate-release portion; and (ii) 1% to 50% of doxycycline, a controlled-release polymer, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as a controlled-release portion, wherein the pharmaceutical composition provides a total daily dosage of 40 mg when administered once daily. Further, it relates to a process for the preparation of said pharmaceutical composition and its use for treating rosacea. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION U.S. Pat. No. 7,749,532 discloses the use of doxycycline at sub-antimicrobial doses to treat rosacea. It further discloses a doxycycline composition consisting of (i) an immediate-release portion consisting of about 30 mg doxycycline, and (ii) a delayed-release portion consisting of about 10 mg doxycycline, in which the delayed-release portion is in the form of pellets coated with at least one enteric polymer. It further discloses that the enteric coating is such that there is no substantial release of doxycycline in the acidic stomach environment, and doxycycline is released only in the small intestine. There remains a need in the art for a pharmaceutical composition of doxycycline which releases the drug in a continuous manner independent of the pH of the gastrointestinal tract. This is achieved by the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention which comprises specific amounts of doxycycline as immediate-release and controlled-release portions, in order to demonstrate a continuous release profile. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising (i) 50% to 99% of doxycycline and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as an immediate-release portion; and (ii) 1% to 50% of doxycycline, a controlled-release polymer, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as a controlled-release portion, wherein the pharmaceutical composition provides a total daily dosage of 40 mg when administered once daily. It also provides a process for the preparation of the pharmaceutical composition and its use for the treatment of rosacea.

The tablet obtained in step 6 was further film coated using Opadry®. Dissolution Data The composition of Example 12 was subjected to a dissolution method which involves carrying out the dissolution of the composition in 900 mL of 0.1N HCl having pH of 1.2 using dissolution apparatus (USP type II) with paddles rotating at 75 rpm. The dissolution profile is provided in Table 4 below.
