FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to imaging techniques used in medicine, and more particularly to medical ultrasound, and still more particularly to an apparatus for producing ultrasonic images using multiple apertures. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In order to insonify the body tissues, a beam formed either by a phased array or a shaped transducer is scanned over the tissues to be examined. Traditionally, the same transducer or array is used to detect the returning echoes. This design configuration lies at the heart of one of the most significant limitations in the use of ultrasonic imaging for medical purposes; namely, poor lateral resolution. Theoretically, the lateral resolution could be improved by increasing the aperture of the ultrasonic probe, but the practical problems involved with aperture size increase have kept apertures small and lateral resolution poor. Unquestionably, ultrasonic imaging has been very useful even with this limitation, but it could be more effective with better resolution. In the practice of cardiology, for example, the limitation on single aperture size is dictated by the space between the ribs (the intercostal spaces). For scanners intended for abdominal and other use, the limitation on aperture size is not so obvious, but it is a serious limitation nevertheless. The problem is that it is difficult to know the exact position of the elements of a large apparatus with multiple and separate physical points of contact (“footprints”) on the patient. For optimum performance, all of the separated transmit and receive elements should be in the same scan plane. In addition, each element position must be known to within 1/10 wavelength (for example, 0.03 mm at 3 MHz). With conventional ultrasound probes, regardless of array vertical displacement or integration (e.g., 1.5D or 2D), there has never been a need to solve alignment and position issues between multiple arrays or multiple individual elements. The methods and apparatus included here teach how to solve these problems for Universal Multiple Aperture ultrasound probes. In constructing and maintaining a Universal Multiple Aperture Probe using a combination of two or more individual arrays, attention must be paid to each array's ultrasound beam displacement relative to a central array Z axis. The displacement or rotational axes referred to are X, Y and Z. X varies about the longitudinal array axis, Y varies about the central array axes, also termed twist, and Z varies about the transverse or lateral array axis. A fixture and method for measuring the variation of each array was developed and implemented. Element position is equally important as displacement from the central array Z axis. The positional relationship of each array element to every other element needs to be established within an individual array and from array to array. The type of crystal used in each array is irrelevant. That is, any one, one and a half, or two dimensional crystal arrays (1D, 1.5D, 2D, such as a piezoelectric array) and all types of Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUT) can be utilized in multi-aperture configurations.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A Multiple Aperture Ultrasound Imaging (MAUI) Probe or Transducer can vary by medical application. That is, a general radiology probe can contain multiple transducers that maintain separate physical points of contact with the patient's skin, allowing multiple physical apertures. A cardiac probe may contain as few as two transmitters and receivers where the probe fits simultaneously between two or more intercostal spaces. An intracavity version of the probe, will space transmit and receive transducers along the length of the wand, while an intravenous version will allow transducers to be located on the distal length the catheter and separated by mere millimeters. In all cases, operation of multiple aperture ultrasound transducers can be greatly enhanced if they are constructed so that the elements of the arrays are aligned within a particular scan plane. One aspect of the invention solves the problem of constructing a multiple aperture probe that functionally houses multiple transducers which may not be in alignment relative to each other. The solution involves bringing separated elements or arrays of elements into alignment within a known scan plane. The separation can be a physical separation or simply a separation in concept wherein some of the elements of the array can be shared for the two (transmitting or receiving) functions. A physical separation, whether incorporated in the construction of the probe's casing, or accommodated via an articulated linkage, is also important for wide apertures to accommodate the curvature of the body or to avoid non-echogenic tissue or structures (such as bone). Any single omni-directional receive element (such as a single crystal pencil array) can gather information necessary to reproduce a two-dimensional section of the body. In some embodiments, a pulse of ultrasound energy is transmitted along a particular path; the signal received by the omni-directional probe can be recorded into a line of memory. When the process for recording is complete for all of the lines in a sector scan, the memory can be used to reconstruct the image. In other embodiments, acoustic energy is intentionally transmitted to as wide a two-dimensional slice as possible. Therefore all of the beam formation must be achieved by the software or firmware associated with the receive arrays. There are several advantages to doing this: 1) It is impossible to focus tightly on transmit because the transmit pulse would have to be focused at a particular depth and would be somewhat out of focus at all other depths, and 2) An entire two-dimensional slice can be insonified with a single transmit pulse. Omni-directional probes can be placed almost anywhere on or in the body: in multiple or intercostal spaces, the suprasternal notch, the substernal window, multiple apertures along the abdomen and other parts of the body, on an intracavity probe or on the end of a catheter. The construction of the individual transducer elements used in the apparatus is not a limitation of use in multi-aperture systems. Any one, one and a half, or two dimensional crystal arrays (1D, 1.5D, 2D, such as a piezoelectric array) and all types of Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUT) can be utilized in multi-aperture configurations to improve overall resolution and field of view. Transducers can be placed either on the image plane, off of it, or any combination. When placed away from the image plane, omni-probe information can be used to narrow the thickness of the sector scanned. Two-dimensional scanned data can best improve image resolution and speckle noise reduction when it is collected from within the same scan plane. Greatly improved lateral resolution in ultrasound imaging can be achieved by using probes from multiple apertures. The large effective aperture (the total aperture of the several sub apertures) can be made viable by compensation for the variation of speed of sound in the tissue. This can be accomplished in one of several ways to enable the increased aperture to be effective rather than destructive. The simplest multi-aperture system consists of two apertures, as shown in FIG. 1. One aperture could be used entirely for transmit elements 110 and the other for receive elements 120. Transmit elements can be interspersed with receive elements, or some elements could be used both for transmit and receive. In this example, the probes have two different lines of sight to the tissue to be imaged 130. That is, they maintain two separate physical apertures on the surface of the skin 140. Multiple Aperture Ultrasonic Transducers are not limited to use from the surface of the skin, they can be used anywhere in or on the body to include intracavity and intravenous probes. In transmit/receive probe 110, the positions of the individual elements Tx1 through Txn can be measure in three different axes. This illustration shows the probe perpendicular to the x axis 150, so each element would have a different position x and the same position y on the y axis 160. However, the y axis positions of elements in probe 120 would be different since it is angled down. The z axis 170 comes in or out of the page and is very significant in determine whether an element is in or out of the scan plane. Referring to FIG. 1, suppose that a Transmit Probe containing ultrasound transmitting elements T1, T2, . . . Tn 110 and a Receive Probe 120 containing ultrasound receive elements R1, R2, . . . Rm are placed on the surface of a body to be examined (such as a human or animal). Both probes can be sensitive to the same plane of scan, and the mechanical position of each element of each probe is known precisely relative to a common reference such as one of the probes. In one embodiment, an ultrasound image can be produced by insonifying the entire region to be imaged (e.g., a plane through the heart, organ, tumor, or other portion of the body) with a transmitting element (e.g., transmit element Tx1), and then “walking” down the elements on the Transmit probe (e.g., Tx2, . . . Txn) and insonifying the region to be imaged with each of the transmit elements. Individually, the images taken from each transmit element may not be sufficient to provide a high resolution image, but the combination of all the images can provide a high resolution image of the region to be imaged. Then, for a scanning point represented by coordinates (i,j) it is a simple matter to calculate the total distance “a” from a particular transmit element Txn to an element of tissue at (i,j) 130 plus the distance “b” from that point to a particular receive element. With this information, one could begin rendering a map of scatter positions and amplitudes by tracing the echo amplitude to all of the points for the given locus. Another multi-aperture system is shown FIG. 2 and consists of transducer elements in three apertures. In one concept, elements in the center aperture 210 can be used for transmit and then elements in the left 220 and right 230 apertures can be used for receive. Another possibility is that elements in all three apertures can be used for both transmit and receive, although the compensation for speed of sound variation would be more complicated under these conditions. Positioning elements or arrays around the tissue to be imaged 240 provides much more data than simply having a single probe 210 over the top of the tissue. The Multiple Aperture Ultrasonic Imaging methods described herein are dependent on a probe apparatus that allows the position of every element to be known and reports those positions to any new apparatus the probe becomes attached. FIGS. 3 and 4 demonstrate how a single omni-probe 310 or 410 can be attached to a main transducer (phased array or otherwise) so as to collect data, or conversely, to act as a transmitter where the main probe then becomes a receiver. In both of these embodiments the omni-probe is already aligned within the scan plan. Therefore, only the x and y positions 350 need be calculated and transmitted to the processor. It is also possible to construct a probe with the omni-probe out of the scan plane for better transverse focus. An aspect of the omni-probe apparatus includes returning echoes from a separate relatively non-directional receive transducer 310 and 410 located away from the insonifying probe transmit transducer 320 and 420, and the non-directional receive transducer can be placed in a different acoustic window from the insonifying probe. The omni-directional probe can be designed to be sensitive to a wide field of view for this purpose. The echoes detected at the omni-probe may be digitized and stored separately. If the echoes detected at the omni-probe (310 in FIG. 3 and 410 in FIG. 4) are stored separately for every pulse from the insonifying transducer, it is surprising to note that the entire two-dimensional image can be formed from the information received by the one omni. Additional copies of the image can be formed by additional omni-directional probes collecting data from the same set of insonifying pulses. In FIG. 5, the entire probe, when assembled together, is used as an add-on device. It is connected to both an add-on instrument or MAUI Electronics 580 and to any host ultrasound system 540. The center array 510 can be used for transmit only. The outrigger arrays 520 and 530 can be used for receive only and are illustrated here on top of the skin line 550. Reflected energy off of scatterer 570 can therefore only be received by the outrigger arrays 520 and 530. The angulation of the outboard arrays 520 and 530 are illustrated as angles α1 560 or α2 565. These angles can be varied to achieve optimum beamforming for different depths or fields of view. α1 and α2 are often the same for outboard arrays, however, there is no requirement to do so. The MAUI Electronics can analyze the angles and accommodate unsymmetrical configurations. FIG. 5a demonstrates the right transducer 510 being used to transmit, and the other transducer 520 is being used to receive. FIG. 6 is much like FIG. 5, except the Multiple Aperture Ultrasound Imaging System (MAUI Electronics) 640 used with the probe is a stand-alone system with its own onboard transmitter (i.e., no host ultrasound system is used). This system may use any element on any transducer 610, 620, or 630 for transmit or receive. The angulation of the outboard arrays 610 and 630 is illustrated as angle α 660. This angle can be varied to achieve optimum beamforming for different depths or fields of view. The angle is often the same for outboard arrays; however, there is no requirement to do so. The MAUI Electronics will analyze the angle and accommodate unsymmetrical configurations. In this illustration, transmitted energy is coming from an element or small group of elements in Aperture 2 620 and reflected off of scatterer 670 to all other elements in all the apertures. Therefore, the total width 690 of the received energy is extends from the outermost element of Aperture 1 610 to the outmost element of Aperture 2 630. FIG. 6a shows the right array 610 transmitting, and all three arrays 610, 620 and 630 receiving. FIG. 6b shows elements on the left array 610 transmitting, and elements on the right array 620 receiving. Using one transducer for transmit only has advantages with regard to a lack of distortion due to variation in fat layer. In a standalone system, transmit and/or receive elements can be mixed in both or all three apertures. FIG. 6 b is much like FIG. 5a, except the Multiple Aperture Ultrasound Imaging System (MAUI Electronics) 640 used with the probe is a stand-alone system with its own o-board transmitter. This system may use any element on any array 610 or 620 for transmit or receive as is shown in FIG. 6c. As shown in either FIG. 6b or FIG. 6c, a transmitting array provides angle off from the target that adds to the collective aperture width 690 the same way two receive only transducers would contribute. Embodiments described herein include a precision carrier for the proper alignment of a universal multiple aperture ultrasound transducer. Referring now to FIGS. 7a-7c, transducer array 2161 can be already “potted” in its own fixture 2161 with lens 2162 intact. Potting procedures are conventional methods to secure the transducer array to its lens and to the case. Flex circuitry, cabling, and attachment to the larger multiple aperture ultrasound transducer fixture can take place after the potting procedure is complete. A benefit of the invention is that it does not require the same transducers to be utilized during the alignment. Different transducers with different “pots” can be utilized in any location of the alignment fixture thanks to the flexibility of the alignment carrier. FIGS. 8 a-8c provide views of the basic structure and features of embodiments of a precision carrier 2150 for a multiple aperture ultrasound transducer array. FIG. 8a shows a top view of a precision array carrier 2150 with six positioning screws 2151. FIG. 8b shows a side view of a precision array carrier 2150 having two threaded screw holes 2180 on each side. When positioning screws 2151 are inserted into threaded screw holes (e.g., screw holes 2155 and 2156 in FIG. 7b), adjustments may be made to employ longitudinal corrections 2159 to the “seated” array. FIG. 8c shows a side view of a precision carrier 2150 with threaded screw holes 2180 located on each end. When positioning screws are inserted into these threaded screw holes, adjustments may be made to employ lateral corrections 2160 to the “seated” array (as illustrated in FIG. 7c). FIGS. 9 a-9d show a precision array carrier 2150 with an array-centering gasket 2152 installed. FIG. 9a is a top view of the precision carrier 2150, with an array-centering gasket 2152 placed at the bottom of the carrier where the lens 2162 located in the center. FIGS. 9b-9d show side, end, and bottom views of the carrier, respectively. The array centering gasket 2152 on the carrier's L shaped shoulder 2181 as illustrated in FIG. 7b. In FIG. 9b the gasket 2152 extends the entire length of the carrier over the L shaped shoulder 2181. The gasket 2152 extends around the corners of the L shaped shoulder 2181 to cover the ends of the carrier as it illustrated in FIG. 9c. The gasket provides the array translational centering and a pivot point for positioning adjustments during operation without interfering with the integrity of the lens 2162. FIG. 9d provides a view of the lens 2162, the bottom of the precision carrier array centering gasket 2152, and finally the L shaped shoulder 2181. Referring back to FIGS. 7a-7c, which show top, end, and side views, respectively of a precision array carrier 2150 with an array 2161 inserted therein. The array 2161 is supported end-to-end by positioning screws 2155 and 2156. The array can be supported from each side by positioning screws 2153, 2154, 2157, 2158 and from the bottom by the array centering gasket 2152. FIG. 7b shows the array 2161 in the precision array carrier 2150 being supported by array centering gasket 2152 and ready for longitudinal adjustment. Alternately tightening and loosening positioning screws 2155 and 2156 allows the array 2161 to be adjusted through arc 2159 to correct longitudinal axis errors. FIG. 7c shows the array 2161 in the precision array carrier 2150 supported by the array centering gasket 2152 ready for transverse alignment. Alternately adjusting positioning screw pairs 2157, 2158 and 2153, 2154 allow the array 2161 to be corrected for transverse axis errors. FIGS. 10 a and 10b show a top views of a precision array carrier 2150 with the array 2161 inserted. Arrows depict, respectively, counter-clockwise and clockwise rotational adjusting by way of selective screw adjustments. FIG. 10a shows a tightening of position screws 2153 and 2158 while loosening position screws 2154 and 2157 shifting the array 2161 in a counter-clockwise arc 2165 to correct rotational axis errors. FIG. 10b shows a tightening position of screws 2154 and 2157 while loosening position screws 2153 and 2158 to shift the array 2161 in a clockwise arc 2166 to correct rotational axis errors. FIG. 11 shows an end view of a precision array carrier 2150 installed on a tissue equivalent phantom or test block 2182 and ready to transmit and receive during alignment. A ‘phantom’ is a structure filled with tissue equivalent material that has a speed of sound characteristics similar to that of human tissue with known voids and reflectors placed at known locations within the phantom. This end view of the phantom shows one embodiment including three targets 2167 in profile view. These targets can be echogenic, very reflective, or anechoic, void of reflection. The top target can be at a pre-determined depth D from the surface of the phantom and the face of array carrier 2150. The other targets can be spaced at distances D1 and D2 from the top target. In some embodiments, the pre-determined depth D can be 100 mm from the top target to the face of the array. The other targets can have D1 and D2 distances of 10 mm, for example. However, any range of depths for the targets 2167 can be used, depending on the desired application of the transducer arrays. The perpendicular targets 2167 serve to assist during the longitudinal adjustment of the array positioning. When correctly positioned, the three targets would be displayed as exactly perpendicular to the front of the array, and further, each target 2167 would be displayed equidistantly one a top the other. FIG. 12 shows a side view of the phantom 2182 with the ends of the targets 2167 visible. Once transmitting and receiving, a lateral adjustment could be made to the array 2163 in the carrier 2150. The correct alignment is for achieved when all targets are visible above and below the center target 2168. FIGS. 13 a-13c show a precision array carrier 2150 with an array 2161 inserted and aligned, in top, side, and end views, respectively. At this stage an acoustic damping material 2162 can be poured into the gap between the array and the carrier to stabilize the position of arrays 2161. FIG. 13b is a side view of the precision array carrier 2150 showing the gap between the array 2161 and the precision array carrier 2150 filled with acoustic damping material 2162. FIG. 13c shows the gap between the array 2161 and the precision array carrier 2150 filled with acoustic damping material 2162. FIGS. 14 a-14c show the precision array carrier 2150 with the array 2161 inserted and aligned in top, side, and end views, respectively. The acoustic damping material 2162 has cured and the six alignment screws have been removed. FIG. 14b is a side view of the precision array carrier 2150 with the array 2161 inserted, aligned, the acoustic damping material 2162 cured and the position alignment screws removed: At this point, the precision array carrier 2150 with its captured array becomes a precision carrier array assembly 2163. FIG. 15 shows a multi-aperture ultrasound probe assembly 2183 constructed with precision transducer receptacles surrounded by structural supports 2164. The structural supports 2164 can be constructed out of many hard materials (e.g., metals or plastics) and usually are built into a larger structure such as the probe 2200 in FIG. 22. In FIG. 15, the three precision carrier array assemblies 2163 are inserted into the precision transducer receptacles 2166. FIG. 16 shows the multi-aperture probe assembly 2183 having precision transducer receptacles 2166 with the precision array assemblies 2163 each locked into the receptacles, thus completing the construction of the multi-aperture ultrasound probe 2184 having three transducer arrays. FIG. 22 shows a completed probe 2200 with arrays 1701, 1702, and 1703 fitted in array receptacles and ready for submission to the calibration cycle. Alternative apparatus and methods for constructing and aligning multi-aperture ultrasound probes will now be discussed. As described above, variations in the ultrasound beam displacement or rotation of both the insonifying and receiving probes about the x, y and z axes must be detected and corrected. A MAUI alignment fixture for aligning a multi-aperture probe uses one or more precision angular alignment controls, precision stage assemblies that provide for the adjustment, in 6 degrees of freedom of the each array under test. One of the great practical difficulties in making multi-aperture imaging systems, as outlined above, is the requirement to precisely align the elements of the multiple arrays. It is well recognized that by increasing the effective aperture of a probe system by including more than one probe head and using the elements of all of the probes to render an image, the lateral resolution of the image can be greatly improved. In order to render an image, the relative positions of all of the elements must be known precisely. Optionally, if the probe system has position and rotation adjustments, a display is provided to position all of the elements to be in the same plane of scan and to transmit or receive in the same plane of scan. FIG. 17 shows a probe system 1700 comprising three probes 1701, 1702, and 1703 working together as a multi-aperture transducer though not assembled in a single shell. This is not a standard embodiment of a multiple aperture transducer, but serves here to aid in describing arrays alignment. A multi-aperture transducer can comprise of any number of arrays 1710, 1720, 1730 (two or more), or even individual elements. For practical reasons, arrays in probes can easily be manufactured with a large number of elements and element spacing within a head can be well controlled. If one can precisely position the end elements of each probe, it is possible to imply the positions of the other elements. Therefore, a fixture will be described which finds the positions of the elements. This apparatus could determine the exact location of independent elements either inside or outside of an array; however, because arrays are typically constructed in a linear format, the embodiment discussed here only identifies the end elements. In FIG. 17 these end elements are designated as element numbers 0 through 5, where 0 and 1 are the end elements of array 1710, 2 and 3 are the end elements of arrays 1720 and 4 and 5 are the end elements of array 1730. Any of the intermediate elements could be located in the same way as will be described. A precision alignment stage assembly is shown in FIG. 18a. The far left area of the assembly 1801 allows for the mechanical connection of a single probe, such as 1701 from FIG. 17. The precision alignment stage assembly has three separate mechanisms 1801, 1802 and 1803 that control the position of the attached array in x, y and z axes. Several alignment stage assemblies can be used in concert so that multiple probe arrays can be manipulated independently. FIG. 18b allows the operator to manipulate an array in any axis by using controls 1805, 1806, 1807, 1808, and bearing 1809. Precision screws 1804, 1805, 1806, 1807, and 1808 can be adjusted, and bearing 1809 can be rotated to affect one or more axes for the array during the alignment process. FIG. 25 shows the arrays 1710, 1720 and 1730 attached in line to precision alignment stages 2510, 2520 and 2530. With the arrays set in place, they can now transmit to common points of interest and compare their points of impact with the other arrays. FIG. 20 illustrates probes 1701, 1702 and 1703 from FIG. 17 now attached to alignment stage assemblies above a tank or test block 2012. The tank can be filled with any liquid, fluid, gel, solid, or other medium 2014 that is desirable for manufacture and safety considerations, as long as the speed of sound for the fluid is known. The tank can include a mounting location for the alignment stage assemblies. In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 20, multiple alignment stage assemblies holding transducer elements can be mounted on the test block. From this position, it is possible to transmit ultrasonic pulses from the elements of any of the arrays to be received by ultrasonic sensor or hydrophones 2085 at the other end of the tank 2012. Referring now to FIGS. 19a-19b, a multi-axis ultrasonic sensor or hydrophone 2085 may be used to detect the X, Y and Z positions of each element of a single array or multiple arrays under test. The multi-axis hydrophone 2085 can include a transverse hydrophone 2086, and right and left hydrophones 2087 and 2088. The common targets for the probes 1701, 1702 and 1703 to shoot at are elements 2091, 2092 and 2093 on the right hydrophone 2087. On the left hydrophone 2088, elements 2094, 2095, and 2096 are the targets. The basic technique for aligning and calibrating a multiple aperture probe can now be addressed referring to FIGS. 19a, 19b and 20. The probe can be attached to a signal generator configured to excite any of the transducer elements to transmit ultrasonic pulses. An ultrasonic signal is transmitted which exhibits good autocorrelation properties (e.g., a long frequency sweep, or ‘chirp’ waveform, a short (wideband) pulse, a spread spectrum waveform, etc.) from at least one element in arrays 1710, 1720 and 1730. The transmitted ultrasound signal can travel through the test block and be received by the receiving hydrophone transducer elements 2091, 2092, 2093, 2094, 2095, 2096 and the transverse hydrophone 2086. It is important to note that detection of the ultrasonic signal or pulse as received by the hydrophone arrays cannot be detected accurately enough by cross correlation with the signal impressed on the probe element because the probe element itself distorts the signal. Two innovative techniques are used to obtain the needed accuracy in finding the relative time delays and hence the relative distances. The first technique is to use cross correlation between the signal received at one element of the hydrophone (for example 2091) and the signal received at another element of the same hydrophone (for example 2093). The correlation peak will yield the time difference and thus the distance difference. The second technique is to interpolate between samples of the received waveforms to obtain better time resolution than simply the sampling interval. Perhaps the best way to accomplish both of these tasks is to take the Fourier transform of both signals, fill in zeros for the high frequency components of a much larger transform. Call these larger transforms FFT1 and FFT2. Then find the peak of the inverse transform of (FFT1*(conjugate of FFT2)). A third technique is necessary to convert differential distances to total distance. Consider the triangle bce in FIG. 21a where the point b represents one of the elements for which we need to compute a position, and c and e are known reference points in the bottom of the water tank. It is desired to measure the lengths d4 and d0 by triangulation, but just knowing the difference between d0 and d4 is not enough. By adding a transverse hydrophone (see 2086 In FIG. 19a) in the bottom of the tank we have two triangles from which we can compute d0 and d4. Let e, d, and c be the locations of the hydrophones 2094, 2095 and 2096 or 2091, 2092 and 2093 of FIG. 19a. For the following analysis, the hydrophones 2094, 2095 and 2096 must be on the same line and on a parallel line to that formed by 2091, 2092 and 2093. The distance between 2094 and 2095 is designated d1, and the distance between 2095 and 2096 is designated d3 d1 and d3 must be known precisely as this becomes the reference “yardstick” for the other measurements. 2095 should be roughly centered between 2094 and 2096LN, but d1 does not need to equal d3. The same requirements apply to R0, RC, and RN. Let d2 be the reference distance and define measured distances as: [in-line-formulae]d2m=d2−d2=0[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]d0m=d0−d2 [/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]d4m=d4−d2 [/in-line-formulae] From the law of cosines we have [in-line-formulae]d42=d22+d32−2d3d2 cos α[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]d02=d22+d12−2d1d2 cos(π−α)=d22+d12+2d1d2 cos α[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]cos α=(d42−d22−d32)/(−2d3d2)=(d02−d22−d12)/(2d1d2)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]d42−d22−d32=−(d02−d22−d12)d3/d1 [/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae](d4m+d2)2−d22−d32+(d0m+d2)2d3/d1−d22d3/d1−d1d3=0[/in-line-formulae] Combining and cancelling terms this becomes [in-line-formulae]d2=(−d4m2+d32−d0m2d3/d1+d1d3)/(2d4m+2d0md3/d1)[/in-line-formulae] Then d0=d0m+d2 and d4=d4m+d2 Thus we have the full measurements from received differential times. Two parallel “yardsticks” or right and left hydrophones are provided in the bottom of the tank in order to measure position along the z axis from FIG. 1, and as is illustrated in FIG. 23b. It will be the goal to position all of the probe elements from all three arrays 1701, 1702 and 1703 in a line midway between the two yardsticks using the various controls illustrated in FIG. 18b. Referring now to FIG. 21b, consider the measurement of the position of any probe element such as M01206. First, consider using the right yardstick R0-RC-RN 2091, 2092, 2093. By transmitting a chirp signal from element M01206 and receiving it on hydrophones at R0, RC, and RN 2091, 2092 and 2093, one can calculate the differential times for transmission along the paths d0, d2, and d4. Times can be converted to distances if the speed of ultrasound of the test block medium is known. If the test block medium is water, the speed of sound is approximately sos=1.40238742+5.03821344*TE/1000.−5.80539349*TEA2/100000.+3.32000870*TE^3/10000000.−1.44537900*TE^4/1000000000.+2.99402365*TE^5/1000000000000. (mm per microsecond) where TE is the temperature in degrees Celsius. Differential distances can be converted to total distances according to the derivation above. Now from trigonometry, distance a=((d02−d42+(d1+d3)2)/(2(d1+d3)) The position along the x′ axis is d1−a. Assuming that the element is midway between the two yardsticks, then the position along the y′ axis is sqrt((d02−a2−(zr/2)2)). Initially considerable error may occur as a result of this assumption, but the measurement of z will allow for adjustment of the element or the entire probe assembly until this assumption is satisfied. Again referring to FIG. 21b, the same computations for x′ and y′ can be made using the left yardstick 2094, 2095 and 2095; and, the results can be averaged for increased accuracy. But the main reason for having two yardsticks is the ability to measure the z axis; the elements position in or out of the scan plane as illustrated in FIG. 1. Then the array alignment apparatus can display it (see FIG. 23a, 2300), and thus allow either manual (FIG. 18b) or automatic (FIG. 24) correction and alignment. The z variable is proportional to the time of arrival difference of the pulse as received at RC 2092 and LC 2095. The probe position should be adjusted until the time difference is close to zero. When this is done, all of the x and y measurements will be accurate and the relative positions of all of the elements will be known. Finally a controller (such as a computer) can scan and find the maximum signal strength on the transverse hydrophone 2086 and record the angular displacement for the probe element. To use the multiple aperture array alignment apparatus as a daily calibrator, multiple aperture ultrasound transducers will already be fully assembled, such as the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 22. Therefore, all of these measurements will have to be referenced to axes on the probe assembly. In the multi-aperture transducer probe assembly 2200 shown in FIG. 22, it would be reasonable to rotate and translate all measurements to a new coordinate system (x,y) centered on the center array. The appropriate coordinate system would be dependent on the ultrasound imaging system for which the probe assembly would be used. The multi-aperture probe can have a resident calibration memory or cal chip 2201 that can be programmed with calibration data received from the automated precision stage assembly, described below. The transmit synchronization module 2202 is not related to calibration, but is necessary to identify the start of pulse when the probe is used as an add-on device with a host machine transmitting. The probe displacement sensor 2203 can be an accelerometer or gyroscope that senses the three-dimensional movement of the probe. During calibration, the probe must be securely attached to the array alignment apparatus so that the probe is still. Referring now to FIG. 23a, a proprietary graphical user interface or GUI 2300, allows the elemental array data to be visualized in real-time allowing for correction of the x, y and z variation errors. The two wide vertical lines 2001 and 2003 represent the z positions of the yardsticks R0-RC-RN (2091, 2092, and 2093 from FIG. 19a) and L0-LC-LN (2094, 2095, and 2096 from FIG. 19a). The thinner vertical line 2302 is the z=0 line and the desired position of each of the elements of a probe system. The vertical position is the x coordinate. Each small square, such as 2305, 2306, 2307, 2308, 2309, 2310 and 2011, is the position of a probe element in the x-z plane. In this example there are six small squares indicating the positions of the end elements of three probe heads. However, the positions of more or fewer elements could be displayed in this way. The thin horizontal lines 2312, 2313, 2314, 2315, 2316, 2317 and 2018 represent the directivity and angular spread of each element as detected on the multi-axis hydrophone. A useful angular spread measure is the number of hydrophone elements on the transverse hydrophone array which record signal strength greater or equal to half of the maximum strength. FIG. 23 b depicts a probe element positioned correctly with the z position 2305 at or near z=0 and its directivity positioned over the centerline. In contrast, FIG. 23c depicts a probe element with its z position 2305 offset toward the right hydrophone. The resulting display shows the small square, 2305, to the right of centerline, 2302. Note that in this case, the element position is in error, but the element directivity remains over the centerline as indicated on the display by the horizontal line 2312 remaining centered over centerline, 2302. Finally, FIG. 23d depicts a probe element correctly positioned with its z 2305 position at or near z=0, 2302. The directivity 2312, however, is misaligned in this case with an offset toward the left hydrophone as indicated by the horizontal line shifted to the left of centerline, 2302. In this case, the directivity needs to be corrected by adjusting the angulation to bring the directivity back over center. This could be accomplished, for example, by using controls 1805 and 1807 in FIG. 18b. Thus with this display, element position and directivity can be monitored simultaneously and both brought into alignment. Adjustments of the probe position and angulation with the precision alignment stage assembly or assemblies should continue until all of the small squares and all of the horizontal lines are aligned on the center vertical line as closely as practicable, ensuring in alignment in the z axis. As this is done, the x and y positions will be computed accurately and no separate iteration will be required for these. In some manufacturing formats, arrays 2406 could be loaded into an automated precision stage assembly like the one in FIG. 24. Here, arrays while still within their nose pieces can still be manipulated. In FIG. 24, we see an automated precision stage assembly, 2406, fitted with precision stepper motors, 2403. Stepper motor controller, 2401, drives the transducer, 2405, under test in response to instructions from controller, 2402. The controller, 2401, evaluates data from the hydrophone assembly, 2404, and calculates transducer corrections. Test programs residing in the controller, 2402, provide transducer specific calibration data back to the transducer, 2405, under test incorporation in it's on board calibration chip, 2201. This automatically acquired element and array position data would be MAUI probe specific and would be used to optimize probe and system performance. Using the precision stage assemblies with the array alignment system is only part of the value of the system. FIGS. 26a and 26b illustrate array alignment systems 2610 attached to the control unit 2620 of an ultrasound machine 2600. A cut away shows hydrophone assembly 2085 is located at the bottom of the fluid filled system 2610. In FIG. 26a a MAUI general radiology probe 2630 is affixed to the system for testing. In FIG. 26b, a MAUI cardiac probe 2640 is affixed to the system for calibration. The portability of this system, therefore allows for calibration of probes in the field multiple times per day. Additionally the MAUI system would alert the operator if service or maintenance was required. To calibrate a probe, MAUI electronic apparatus can send a test pattern to the arrays in the probe to transmit to the hydrophone assembly 2085. When the positions of the probes and their directivities are reported as a result of the sequence, the positions of all of the elements can be downloaded to a file specific to that probe. Each file is stored in the probe calibration chip 2201. The calibration chip reports element positions in x, y and z axes to every MAUI electronic apparatus it connects to, and therefore can perform multiple aperture imaging without recalibrating before use with a different MAUI apparatus. The calibration chip memory can also be used to analyze probe performance and reliability. In the special case in which all of the transmit and receive elements are aligned in the same plane or are manufactured so that there is no adjustment in z position, a simplified alignment fixture can be used. Instead of two parallel “yardsticks” of hydrophones, a single yardstick can be used. In this case the probe would be centered over the single yardstick using a plumb bob or a clamping device. The x and y measurements would then be made assuming z=0 and zr=0. This is possible since accuracy in the value of z is much less critical in beamforming than is accuracy in the values of x and y. Thus adjusting z by the relatively crude methods of sighting with a plumb bob or clamping to a machined edge of the probe can be acceptable in spite of the high accuracy demands for measurement of x and y. Obviously, the cost of this simplified fixture would be much reduced resulting in a fixture which could be used in the field rather just in the probe assembly factory.
