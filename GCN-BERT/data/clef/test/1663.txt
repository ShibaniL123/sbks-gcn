PRIORITY CLAIM This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/252,967. BACKGROUND Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polyesters accumulated by a variety of microorganisms in response to nutrient limitation or an environmental stress. The intracellular storage of these bioplastics provides a reserve of carbon, energy, and reducing power. The material properties of PHAs are similar to those of traditional petroleum-based plastics, like polypropylene, which enables their use in commercial and medical applications. Additionally, PHAs have the advantages of biodegradability and renewability, therefore providing a sustainable source of non-petrochemically-derived plastic. The high cost of microbial PHA production has limited the use and application of these materials. Specifically, downstream processing and purification procedures can be as much as 50% of the total expense. Traditional PHA downstream processing methods involving the use of solvents, enzymatic digestion, or mechanical disruption are often impractical for industrial-scale recovery. BRIEF DESCRIPTION Disclosed herein is a system whereby a PHA specific binding protein is fused to a signal sequence, allowing for the bioplastic to be transported out of the cell or transported to a cellular domain to facilitate purification.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Definitions “Chimeric polypeptide” means a protein that comprises a first polypeptide connected to a second polypeptide, where the first and second polypeptides are not found connected in nature. The first and second polypeptides may be connected by a peptide bond, or a linker. “Phasin” means an amphipathic protein found associated with PHA granules in cells. Phasins are thought to stabilize the PHA granules. Phasins have been identified in many species, including Cupriavidus necator, Ralstonia euthera, Burkholderia multivorans, Comamonas testosteroni, Rhodoferax ferrireducens, and Polaromonas naphthalenivorans. Table 1 gives a representative listing of phasin proteins. Furthermore, FIG. 1 shows an alignment of the sequences in Table 1.

FA8] 121 YP_286621.1 phasin [Dechloromonas aromatica RCB] The phasins are a well defined class of proteins whose sequences are found in publicly available databases. “Phasin analog” means a phasin protein bearing one or more additions deletions or substitutions of residues compared to the original phasin. Useful phasin analogs include those that retain the property of binding one or more PHAs. By examining and aligning known phasin sequences, a skilled person can determine which phasin residues are conserved across species. Using this alignment, the skilled person could generate a consensus sequence, using, for example, the Clustal algorithm. Since conserved residues are generally those which are required for function (Boffelli D, Nobrega M A, Rubin E M. Comparative genomics at the vertebrate extremes. Nat Rev Genet. 2004; 5:456-465), non-naturally occurring proteins that conform to this consensus sequence would define phasin analogs that likely have the property of binding PHA. For example, an alignment was generated using SEQ ID NOS:1-7, and 29-121. The alignment is presented in FIG. 1. Alternatively, generating phasin analogs with the property of binding PHA could also be accomplished by using existing bioinformatic resources. Proteins and protein domains are often described by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). An HMM of a polypeptide is not a sequence alignment, but it does convey actual structural information about the protein. Most HMMs are based on the probability of any particular residue occurring next to a second residue in the linear sequence of the polypeptide. Using HMMs to describe proteins is discussed in Krogh A, Brown M, Mian I S, Sjölander K, Haussler D, Hidden Markov models in computational biology. Applications to protein modeling. J Mol. Biol. 1994; 235; 1501-31, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The European Bioinformatics Institute maintains the Interpro database, which compiles Hidden Markov Model (HMM) information from various databases, including some described below. Interpro has five different entries which describe phasins. These entries are IPR010127 (Phasin, subfamily 1), IPR018968 (Phasin), IPR010234 (Phasin, subfamily 2), IPR014176 (Phasin, subfamily 3), and IPR008769 (Poly granule associated). The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute maintains the Pfam database, which describes the phasin proteins in terms of HMMs. The Pfam HMMs that define the phasin proteins are PF05597, PF09361, and PF05233. Included in the database for each HMM entry is a feature which allows the user to visualize the information in the HMM. Finally, the J. Craig Venter Institute maintains the TIGR database. The TIGR HMM profiles that describe the probable structure of phasins are TIGR01841, TIGR01985, TIGR02809 and TIGR01837. Although the HMMs do not provide typical sequence information regarding phasin proteins, they do provide a description of the probable structure of a phasin. Thus, analogs of phasin that conform to the HMM would likely have the property of binding PHA. To easily generate sequences of phasin analogs likely to have the property of binding PHA, a skilled person could generate phasin analog sequences using a computer to introduce substitutions, deletions or additions to a phasin sequence. The relative probabilities embodied in the phasin HMMs would guide a skilled person regarding which residues, when mutated, are more likely to lead to a loss of function. The skilled person could then compare the analog sequences to the HMMs in the databases listed above. Those analogs which met the threshold of being tagged as bearing a phasin domain would likely have the property of binding PHA. The HMMs discussed above which describe phasins and phasin analogs are hereby incorporated by reference. “Signal sequence” means a polypeptide sequence which is transported by a cell. A signal sequence may be connected to another polypeptide, and the cell will transport the signal sequence along with the polypeptide to which the signal sequence is attached. Signal sequences generally transport proteins to specific locations in the cell, or transport the protein out of from the cell. Signal sequences exist which will lead to transport of a protein to organelles, to inclusion bodies, to a membrane, to the periplasmic space, or to the extracellular medium. Signal sequences are well known in the art. A skilled person can find a signal sequence for a given organism to target a protein to a particular cellular compartment, or to target a protein for secretion. For example, the Signal sequence website maintained by Katya Kapp at the University of Heidelberg allows the skilled person to browse over 3500 known and characterized signal sequences based on species and on the region to which the signal sequence is transported. The Signal Sequence database of the Signal sequence website is hereby incorporated by reference. Since PHAs are generated by many bacteria, a sample of useful bacterial signal sequences is provided in Table 2 below.

The intracellular storage of these bioplastics provides a reserve of carbon, energy, and reducing power. FIG. 2 depicts a cell with PHA granules in its cytoplasm. The material properties of PHAs are similar to those of traditional petroleum-based plastics, like polypropylene, which enables their use in commercial and medical applications. Additionally, PHAs have the advantages of biodegradability and renewability, therefore providing a sustainable source of non-petrochemically-derived plastic. PHAs have the general formula as depicted in FIG. 3. A very common PHA is polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). PHAs and PHB are discussed in detail in Reddy et al. Polyhydroxyalkanoates: An Overview. Bioresourse Technology 87 (2003) 137-146, which is hereby incorporated by reference. In the context of a phasin or phasin analog interacting with a PHA, “binds to” means that the phasin or phasin analog interacts with the PHA such that if the phasin or phasin analog is transported, a measurable quantity of PHA is transported by association with the phasin or phasin analog. “Connected” and “connecting” mean that two proteins are attached by a peptide bond or a linker. “Linker” means between one and thirty amino acids that connect two proteins. “Residue” means an individual amino acid at a prescribed position in a polypeptide chain. Residues may be identified by a number corresponding to the residue's ordinal position counting from the N-terminus of the polypeptide to the C-terminus. When a promoter “drives transcription” it means that the presence of the promoter is sufficient, under one or more conditions, to cause an RNA polymerase to begin transcribing an mRNA from a polynucleotide. For example a promoter could be a constitutive promoter, which drives transcription under all conditions tested, or it could be a conditional promoter, which only drives transcription under a subset of all conditions tested. “mRNA” means messenger RNA. A polynucleotide or mRNA that “codes for” a polypeptide means that the polynucleotide or mRNA provides a series of nucleotide codons which may be used by a ribosome to generate a given polypeptide according to a genetic code. A “ribosomal binding site” is a sequence in an mRNA which aids in recruiting a ribosome to the mRNA so that the mRNA may be translated. In bacteria, a ribosomal biding site often comprises a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (AGGAGG, SEQ ID NO:24), or a variant of this sequence. In eukaryotes, a ribosomal binding site often comprises a Kozak sequence. The exact sequence of the Kozak sequence varies and this variation affects the efficiency of translation of an mRNA. The skilled person can modify the Kozak consensus sequence to affect translation (see, e.g. Kozak M. Point mutations define a sequence flanking the AUG initiator codon that modulates translation by eukaryotic ribosomes. Cell 44 (2): 283-92, which is hereby incorporated by reference). Furthermore, in eukaryotes, a ribosomal binding site may comprise an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). To “translate” or “translated” means that a ribosome binds to an mRNA and generates a polypeptide that corresponds to the mRNA according to a genetic code. “Terminator sequences” are sequences which cause an RNA polymerase to terminate transcription. To “terminate transcription” means that an individual RNA polymerase disengages from its template polynucleotide and releases the mRNA it was generating. Sometimes, in the process of terminating transcription the 3′ end of the mRNA is polyadenylated. “Adapted for use in” means that a particular sequence is effective for its purpose in a particular species. For example, if a terminator is adapted for use in a species, then the terminator will be able to terminate transcription in that species. Likewise if a promoter is adapted for use in a species, then the promoter will drive transcription in that species. Promoters, ribosomal binding sites and terminators adapted for use in various species are known in the art. “Cell” means a living organism belonging to the prokaryotic or eukaryotic lineage. An “expression system” is one or more polynucleotides which can be introduced into cells to cause expression of a given set of proteins. “PHA anabolic enzymes” are enzymes that, when expressed in a cell, will lead to accumulation of a PHA. PHA anabolic enzymes include PHA synthase (E.C. 2.3.1.-), acetyl CoA acetyltransferase (E.C. 2.3.1.9)/beta ketothiolase, and acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (E.C. 1.1.1.36). For example PhbC (SEQ ID NO:25), PhbA (SEQ ID NO:26), and PhbB (SEQ ID NO: 27) are PHA anabolic enzymes. Polynucleotides which code for these enzymes are found on the plasmid pBHR68. “pLG575” is an expression system for the HlyB and HlyD genes. The HlyB and D genes code for proteins which aid in the export of HlyA from bacterial cells. The construction and sequence of pLG575 is described in further detail in Mackmann et al., Genetical and functional organisation of the Escherichia coli haemolysin determinant 2001, Mol Gen Genet (1985) 201:28-288, which is incorporated by reference. “pBHR68” is an expression plasmid which expresses the PhbC PhbA and PhbB genes in E. Coli. The construction and sequence of this plasmid is described in further detail in Spikermann et al., A sensitive, viable-colony staining method using Nile red for direct screening of bacteria that accumulate polyhydroxyalkanoic acids and other lipid storage compounds, Arch Microbiol (1999) 171:73-80, which is incorporated by reference. “pBHR68:PhaP1:HlyA” is the expression plasmid pBHR68 also containing an polynucleotide for expression of SEQ ID NO:1 connected to SEQ ID NO:8. To “transport” or “transporting” means that a molecule is removed from one location to another. For example, a PHA could be transported from a granule to the periplasmic space, to an inclusion body, or it could be secreted. If eukaryotes generating PHA were provided the PHA could additionally be transported to an organelle. Transport of proteins is generally directed by signal sequences. To “secrete” or “secretion” means transporting the secreted molecule from inside a cell to the outside of the cell. To “express” or “expression” means that a cell is producing a polypeptide according to the information provided to the cell in a polynucleotide. To “transform” or “transforming” means to introduce a polynucleotide into a cell by chemical, electrical or physical means. Methods of transforming cells include chemical destabilization of the cell membrane to allow the polynucleotide to enter, electroporation, microinjection, or firing particles coated with the polypeptide into the cell. To “make available” a polypeptide or a polynucleotide to a cell means that the polypeptide or polynucleotide is introduced into the cell. Methods of introduction include transformation, genetic techniques, and conjugation between bacterial cells. In the context of bioplastic production “collecting” a bioplastic means removing the bioplastic from the vessel in which bioplastic production occurred. “Collecting” does not necessitate purification of the bioplastic from the organism in which the bioplastic was synthesized. “B0034” means the synthetic biology construct identified by “B0034” in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts maintained by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “B0015” means the synthetic biology construct identified by “B0015” in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts maintained by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “R0010” means the synthetic biology construct identified by “R0010” in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts maintained by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “R0011” means the synthetic biology construct identified by “R0011” in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts maintained by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “R0040” means the synthetic biology construct identified by “R0040” in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts maintained by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “R0051” means the synthetic biology construct identified by “R0051” in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts maintained by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Chimeric Polypeptides One aspect of the invention includes chimeric polypeptides which can be used to transport PHAs. In a general sense, the chimeric polypeptide comprises a phasin or a phasin analog which binds to a PHA connected to a signal sequence. The signal sequence may be connected to the N- or C-terminus of the phasin or phasin analog, as appropriate. Many signal sequences are well characterized and the literature directed to a particular signal sequence will apprise the skilled person whether there is a preference for the signal sequence to be connected at the N- or C-terminus of the phasin or phasin analog. The signal sequence may be connected by a peptide bond or by a linker of between one and thirty amino acids. Linkers are commonly used in the art, they provide a spacer between the signal sequence and the phasin or phasin analog. The signal sequence used can be any signal sequence appropriate for the organism in which contains a PHA of interest. Since bacteria synthesize PHAs, bacterial signal sequences are useful. Any bacterial signal sequence may be used. Any of the 1161 confirmed bacterial signal sequences in the Signal sequence Website: Signal Sequence Database may be used.

The scope of the present invention should, therefore, be determined only by the following claims. EXAMPLES Example 1 Plasmids for Chimeric Polypeptide Production Vectors capable of expressing a chimeric protein were designed. A general schematic of the overall expression construct organization is given in FIG. 4B. A promoter drives expression of a phasin gene connected to the DNA coding for a signal sequence. In FIG. 4B, the DNA coding for the signal sequence is 5′ of the phasin gene, but the DNA coding for the signal sequence may also be 3′ of the phasin gene, where the signal sequence used should be C-terminal of the phasin in the chimeric polypeptide (e.g. FIG. 5E). Furthermore, a ribosomal binding site and a terminator are included to ensure proper expression. FIG. 5 shows the various plasmids that were designed. FIG. 5A shows plasmids having a kanamycin bacterial marker gene to select for the presence of the plasmid with kanamycin. The signal sequence used is the bacterial OmpA (SEQ ID NO:12) signal sequence, and it is connected to a phasin. Several examples are provided using the 4 different promoters R0010, R0011, R0051, and R0040. Furthermore the ribosomal binding site B0034 and the terminator B0015 were used. FIG. 5B shows plasmids having a kanamycin bacterial marker gene to select for the presence of the plasmid with kanamycin. The signal sequence used is the bacterial PeIB (SEQ ID NO:11) signal sequence, and it is connected to a phasin. Several examples are provided using 4 different promoters. Several examples are provided using the 4 different promoters R0010, R0011, R0051, and R0040. Furthermore the ribosomal binding site B0034 and the terminator B0015 were used. FIG. 5C shows plasmids having a kanamycin bacterial marker gene to select for the presence of the plasmid with kanamycin. The signal sequence used is the bacterial GeneIII (SEQ ID NO:10) signal sequence, and it is connected to a phasin. Several examples are provided using 4 different promoters. Several examples are provided using the 4 different promoters R0010, R0011, R0051, and R0040. Furthermore the ribosomal binding site B0034 and the terminator B0015 were used. FIG. 5D shows plasmids having a kanamycin bacterial marker gene to select for the presence of the plasmid with kanamycin. The signal sequence used is the bacterial TorA (SEQ ID NO:9) signal sequence, and it is connected to a phasin. Several examples are provided using 4 different promoters. Several examples are provided using the 4 different promoters R0010, R0011, R0051, and R0040. Furthermore the ribosomal binding site B0034 and the terminator B0015 were used. FIG. 5E shows plasmids having a kanamycin bacterial marker gene to select for the presence of the plasmid with kanamycin. The signal sequence used is the bacterial HlyA (SEQ ID NO:8) signal sequence, and it is connected to a phasin. Several examples are provided using 4 different promoters. Several examples are provided using the 4 different promoters R0010, R0011, R0051, and R0040. Furthermore the ribosomal binding site B0034 and the terminator B0015 were used. To facilitate assembly of different polynucleotides, a PstI restriction enzyme site was removed from the phasin coding polynucleotide sequence by site-directed mutagenesis (FIG. 6). A QuikChangeII mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Calif.) was used to produce a point mutation of the nucleotide at position 114 from a G to a T (SEQ ID NO:28). Site-directed mutagenesis using this kit consists of three basic steps. In the first step, primers are designed using the QuikChange® Primer Design Program (Stratagene) and used to create a mutagenic product. Next, methylated and hemimethylated DNA is digested by the addition of DpnI. Lastly, the competent cells are transformed with the mutagenic product. The sequence alteration produced by this method removed the PstI site, but did not alter the corresponding amino acid sequence. Example 2 Initial Confirmation of Signal Sequence Function To initially confirm the function of several secretions signals, HlyA, TorA, GeneIII and PeIB signal sequences (SEQ ID NO:8-11, Table 1) were fused to green fluorescent protein. Fluorescence intensity was then measured in concentrated media samples for each of the signal sequence/GFP devices. Fluorescence was also measured in pSB1A3 (no coding region) supernatant samples and subtracted from each replicate to obtain final fluorescence values. The averages and standard deviations were calculated (FIG. 7). Detected fluorescence in the GFPuv:HlyA supernatant samples was significantly higher than that measured for other signal sequence devices, thereby demonstrating GFP secretion by the presence of a significant amount of HlyA-targeted GFP in the extracellular medium. Targeting GFP with TorA, GeneIII, and PeIB signal sequences resulted in lesser GFP activity in the media, as expected because these signal sequences signal protein transport to the periplasmic space, or to the membrane. Example 3 Analysis of Transport of Chimeric Polypeptides The GeneIII signal sequence fused to the phasin protein was expressed in E. coli cells. The E. coli cells were grown overnight in LB growth media and centrifuged to pellet the cells. Supernatants (5 ml) were then concentrated using a Centricon Centriplus concentrator (Amicon, Beverly Mass.). This process concentrated proteins that were larger than 10 kDa and removed molecules smaller than 10 kDa. Approximately 20 ug of protein were then applied to a SDS polyacrylamide gel to separate the proteins according to size (FIG. 8). The gel was then stained with coomassie blue for protein detection. After SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and subsequent coomassie blue staining of the separated proteins, a protein with an approximate size of 22 kDa is observed in the sample from the phasin-expressing E. coli cells that is not present in the control E. coli sample. The phasin protein has been reported by others to migrate on SDS PAGE from 20-27 kDa. These results indicate that the signal sequence peptide::phasin expression constructs can be produced by the E. coli cells and is being secreted outside the cell into the media. To determine the subcellular localization of these chimeric protein constructs, protein fractions obtained from various subcellular fractionations and from cell free media harvested after 24 hrs of bacteria growth were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The polyacrylamide gels and corresponding immunoblots for each of the four signal sequence constructs are provided as FIG. 9. For cells expressing the PhaP1:HlyA construct (FIG. 9A), a strong phasin band is observed at 22 kDa in the concentrated extracellular media. In these same samples, minimal phasin is observed in the cytoplamsic fraction and a strong band is observed in the membrane fraction. This suggests that the expressed phasin is primarily targeted to the HlyA secretion machinery and translocated to the extracellular media. In analyzed TorA:PhaP1 samples (FIG. 9B), three distinct sizes of phasin were observed, which was consistent to the number and size differences of TorA targeted GFP. The strongest phasin band was observed in the membrane fraction, indicating that some of the targeted protein becomes entrapped in the inner cellular membrane. Periplasmic phasin bands were also observed. Phasin was primarily found in the membrane fraction and extracellular media when GeneIII was used for targeting (FIG. 9C). Samples obtained from PeIB:PhaP1 harboring cells (FIG. 9D) contained significantly larger quantities of overall phasin. In particular, the membrane fraction had high levels of phasin that is apparent as a single smeared band. Phasin was also detected in the extracellular media. This could mean that the PeIB targeted phasin is expressed at more significant levels. The functionality of the chimeric polypeptide constructs is shown by SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein bands at 22 kDa corresponding to the size of phasin are observed. The identity of the phasin protein was confirmed using a phasin-specific antibody. Using immunoblotting procedures, phasin translocation was analyzed and results demonstrate phasin export. A significant phasin band was observed in the extracellular media when HlyA was used for targeting. A supernatant band was also observed for GeneIII-targeted phasin. For the TorA, GeneIII, and PeIB signal sequences, significant levels of phasin were found in the membrane fractions. Periplasmic phasin was also observed when TorA was used for targeting. Example 5 Analysis of Transport of PHB from E. coli E. coli XL1-Blue cells harboring the pBHR68 plasmid were shown capable of accumulating as much as 55% of their cell dry weight as bioplastic. XL1-Blue was determined as a suitable candidate for PHA translocation studies, although this strain produces proteases, which may be dealt with if necessary by the addition of protease inhibitors. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to visualize E. coli cells containing various secretion systems (FIGS. 10-12). Cells containing plasmid pBHR68 that contains the phaCAB genes for PHB production from Ralstonia eutropha and no phasin constructs is shown in FIG. 10. As seen in this Figure a large percentage of the cells are fatter than normal (0.7 μM vs 0.3 μM.) This is presumably due to the increase in bioplastic (PHB) accumulation. SEM was performed on E. coli cells containing pBHR68 as well as plasmid pSB3K3 expressing the lac-regulated phasin protein without any signal sequence (FIG. 11). Phasin production has previously been shown to reduce PHB granule size. SEM was also performed on cells containing pBHR68:PhaP1:HlyA expressing the PHB synthesis genes phbCAB and phasin with the hlyA signal sequence fused to the carboxyl terminus and pLG575 containing the hlyB and hlyD genes for pore formation (FIG. 12). An illustration of this is shown in FIG. 13. E. coli in FIG. 12 are shown secreting PHB in the various panels. To confirm that the substance transported from the E. coli cells is indeed PHB, nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were collected from concentrated supernatants from E. coli. Panel A shows concentrated supernatant from cells containing the entire secretion system except for the secretion tag on the phasin protein. Panel B shows concentrated supernatant from cells containing the entire secretion system. The NMR signature for PHB is clearly visible in panel B and not in panel A. Note the y-axis for panel A only goes to 0.3 while the y-axis goes to 2.4 for panel B, demonstrating that the peaks in panel A are within the baseline for panel B and are mostly just background signals. Panel A corresponds to cells in FIG. 11 and panel B corresponds to cells in FIG. 12. This data demonstrates that the secretion system is working and that bioplastic is being secreted into the media when the phasin protein has a secretion signal attached. 1.
