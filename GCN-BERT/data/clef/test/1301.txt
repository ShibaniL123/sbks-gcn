The compositions in accordance with the invention are suitably in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, auto-injector devices or suppositories. The compositions are intended for oral, parenteral, intranasal, sublingual, or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Formulation of the compositions according to the invention can conveniently be effected by methods known from the art, for example, as described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., 1995. The dosage regimen is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical condition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be treated; the route of administration; and the renal and hepatic function of the patient. An ordinarily skilled physician, veterinarian, or clinician can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the drug required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition. Oral dosages of the present invention, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.01 mg per kg of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) to about 100 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.01 to 10 mg/kg/day, and most preferably 0.1 to 5.0 mg/kg/day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. A medicament typically contains from about 0.01 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredient, preferably, from about 1 mg to about 200 mg of active ingredient. Intravenously, the most preferred doses will range from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. The crystalline forms of the present invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. However, (2R,3S,5R)-2-(2,5-Difluorophenyl)-5-[2-(methylsulfonyl)-2,6-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazol-5(4H)-yl]tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-amine is a long acting DPP-IV inhibitor. Advantageously, the crystalline forms of the present invention may be administered in a single weekly dose. Furthermore, the crystalline forms of the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. In the methods of the present invention, the crystalline forms described herein can form the active pharmaceutical ingredient, and are typically administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients or carriers (collectively referred to herein as ‘carrier’ materials) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, that is, oral tablets, capsules, elixirs, syrups and the like, and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices. For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, inert carrier such as lactose, starch, sucrose, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like; for oral administration in liquid form, the oral drug component can be combined with any oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum and the like. The crystalline forms of Compound I of the present invention have been found to possess a relatively high solubility in water (about 2 mg/ml), rendering them especially amenable to the preparation of formulations, in particular intranasal and intravenous formulations, which require relatively concentrated aqueous solutions of active pharmaceutical ingredient. In a still further aspect, the present invention provides a method for the treatment and/or prevention of clinical conditions for which a DP-IV inhibitor is indicated, which method comprises administering to a patient in need of such prevention or treatment a prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount of a crystalline form of Compound I as defined above in combination with another agent useful for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure. Compounds described herein may exist as tautomers such as keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are encompassed with compounds of structural formula I. The term “% enantiomeric excess” (abbreviated “ee”) shall mean the % major enantiomer less the % minor enantiomer. Thus, a 70% enantiomeric excess corresponds to formation of 85% of one enantiomer and 15% of the other. The term “enantiomeric excess” is synonymous with the term “optical purity.” Compound I can be made by the following methods: INTERMEDIATE 1 tert-Butyl [(2R,3S)-5-oxo-2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl]carbamate Step A: tert-Butyl (1-[methoxy(methyl)amino]-1-oxopent-4-yn-2-yl)carbamate To an inerted vessel was charged N,N-diphenyl glycine ethyl ester (105.45 kg, 394.5 mol), tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (14 kg, 43.4 mol), and propargyl benzenesulfonate (94.45 kg, 481 mol) followed by MTBE (750 kg). Then cesium carbonate (fine mesh grade, 390 kg, 1197 mol) was added and the reaction stirred at 50-60° C. for 1 day. The batch was then cooled to 0-5° C. and water (422 kg) was slowly added. Next, tert-butyl methyl ether (170 kg) was added and the batch concentrated to 473-578 L. Then, 462 kg HCl solution (43 kg conc. HCl in 420 kg water) was added to reach a pH=1-2 below room temperature. After 7 h of stirring, the pH was 1.5 and the organic layer was separated and discarded. The aqueous layer was then cooled to 5-10° C. and 28% aqueous NaOH (151 kg) was added slowly until the pH was 13. Then, a solution of Boc2O (136 kg, 624 mol in 243 kg of tert-butyl methyl ether) was added at 5-10° C. The solution was then stirred at room temperature for 4 h (pH=8) and 17% aqueous NaOH (126 kg) was slowly added followed by more Boc2O solution (30.7 kg, 141 mol in 60 kg tert-butyl methyl ether). The solution was then stirred at room temperature for 4 h (pH=9) and 17% aqueous NaOH (98 kg) was slowly added (pH=13) and stirred an additional 12 h (pH-10) followed by more Boc2O (11 kg, 50 mol). After 4 h of stirring at room temperature, the layers were separated (retained aqueous) and the organics extracted with 3% aqueous NaOH (136 kg). The aqueous layers were combined and added to tert-butyl methyl ether (338 kg). Then, aqueous 17% HCl (362 kg) was added until pH=2. The layers were separated and the aqueous extracted with tert-butyl methyl ether (420 kg). The combined organics were washed with 10% brine (139 kg), dried with Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to 105-158 L. Constant volume distillation with tert-butyl methyl ether continued until KF=0.4%. Carbonyldiimidazole (90 kg, 548 mol) was added to this solution and stirred for 2 h at room temperature. Then (MeO)MeNH2Cl (48 kg, 492 mol) was added and the reaction stirred for 6 h. The batch was then cooled to 0-5° C. and water (80 kg) was added. The batch was then seeded with 100 g seed and water (450 kg) was added. The slurry was stirred at 0-5° C. for 3 h and then filtered. The cake was dried under vacuum at 45-60° C. for 2 days to give tert-butyl (1-[methoxy(methyl)amino]-1-oxopent-4-yn-2-yl)carbamate. Step B: tert-Butyl [1-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-1-oxopent-4-yn-2-yl]carbamate An inerted vessel was charged dichloromethane (866 kg) and cooled to −20 to −10° C. Then iso-propylmagnesium chloride solution in THF (2M, 326.1 kg, 669 mol) was slowly added followed by 1-bromo-2,5-difluorobenzene (120.1 kg, 622 mol). After 2 h at this temperature, an additional charge of iso-propylmagnesium chloride in THF solution was slowly added (2M, 58.65 kg, 121 mol) and the reaction aged 1 h. Then, a drop-wise addition of a dichloromethane solution of tert-butyl (1-[methoxy(methyl)amino]-1-oxopent-4-yn-2-yl)carbamate (70.8 kg, 276 mol in 292 kg dichloromethane) was conducted over 2 h at −20 to −20° C. The mixture was then warmed to room temperature and stirred for 10 h. The reaction was then slowly reverse quenched into aqueous ammonium chloride (175.6 kg in 1550 kg of water) at 5-10° C. The solution pH was then adjusted to ˜7 by adding 68 kg of con. HCl. The layers were then separated and the aqueous extracted with dichloromethane (414 kg). The combined organics were then dried with Na2SO4, filtered, treated with activated carbon (10 kg), filtered, and concentrated to 71-141 L. A constant volume (71-141 L) vacuum distillation solvent switch to n-heptane was then performed to crystallize the product. The slurry was then cooled to 0° C. and stirred 2 h. The slurry was filtered and the cake washed with n-heptane, 2-propanol, and then water. The solids were dried under vacuum at 40-50° C. overnight to give tert-butyl [1-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-1-oxopent-4-yn-2-yl]carbamate. Step C: tert-Butyl [(1S,2S)-1-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-1-hydroxypent-4-yn-2-yl]carbamate To a stirred vessel under nitrogen sweep was charged tert-butyl [1-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-1-oxopent-4-yn-2-yl]carbamate (35.0 kg, 113 mol), 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (38.0 kg, 339 mol), and THF (465 kg). After dissolution, chloro{[(1R,2R)-(+2-amino-1,2-diphenylethyl](pentafluorophenylsulfonyl)amido}-(p-cymene) ruthenium (II) (410 g, 576 mmol) was added. The vessel was vacuum sparged and back-filled with nitrogen three times. Then, formic acid (26.7 kg, 580 mol) was added and the reaction heated to 45° C. overnight. The mixture was then concentrated under vacuum to 210-280 L and tert-butyl methyl ether was then added (210 kg). After cooling to 0-10° C., 0.4% aqueous HCl was added (52 kg) until pH=4-6. After agitation and separation of the layers, the aqueous was extracted again with tert-butyl methyl ether (87 kg). The combined organics were then washed with 4% aq. NaHCO3 (291 kg), and then brine (216 kg). The resulting organics were dried over Na2SO4, filtered through a plug of silica, and concentrated to 70-105 L. Then, tert-butyl methyl ether (132 kg) was added, followed by further batch concentration until KF=0.1%. Next, DMF (133 kg) was added and the batch was further concentrated to 70-105 L. The resulting DMF solution was 165.6 kg containing 19.4% tert-butyl [(1S,2S)-1-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-1-hydroxypent-4-yn-2-yl]carbamate (8.1/1 diastereomeric ratio and 97.9% ee).

The reaction was then aged overnight at room temperature. Next, water (733 kg) was added over 1 h and the reaction stirred rapidly for 1 h. The layers were then separated, discarding the resulting organics layer. To the aqueous layer was charged dichloromethane (510 kg) followed by triethylamine (22.4 kg, 592 mol). After agitation, the layers were separated and the aqueous extracted with dichloromethane (510 kg). The combined organics were washed with 7% aqueous NaHCO3 (2×410 kg) and 5% brine (386 kg). The organics were then dried with Na2SO4, filtered, and treated with activated carbon (6.2 kg of C-941). The carbon was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to 154-193 L.

Form III Form III was produced by dissolving Form I in MeOH and evaporating the solvent, followed by heating to 140° C. and isothermal for 10 min. This phase is metastable to Form I and II and its characterization was limited to the amount of sample available. Form III was analyzed by XRPD and DSC. Form IV Form IV was produced by dissolving Form I in 1:1 THF-water and evaporating the solvent. Anhydrous Form IV is metastable to Form I and II and therefore the characterization was limited to the amount of sample available. Form IV was analyzed using XRPD, DSC and TGA.

Crystalline Form I can be further characterized by the IR spectra of FIG. 5. FIG. 10 is an IR spectra of Form II of Compound I. Crystalline Form II can be further characterized by the IR spectra of FIG. 10. In addition to the X-ray powder diffraction patterns described above, the crystalline forms of Compound I of the present invention were further characterized by means of their differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves and their thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curves. DSC Differential Scanning calorimetry data were acquired using TA Instruments DSC 2910 or DSC2000. Between 2 and 6 mg sample was weighed into a pan and covered. This pan was then covered and placed at the sample position in the calorimeter cell. An empty pan is placed at the reference position. The calorimeter cell is closed and a flow of nitrogen is passed through the cell. The heating program is set to heat the sample at a heating rate of 10° C./min to a temperature of approximately 250° C. The data was analyzed using Universal Analysis 2000 Version 3.9A. The thermal events were integrated between baseline temperature points that are above and below the temperature range over which the thermal event is observed. The data reported are the onset temperature, peak temperature and enthalpy. Crystalline Form I can be further characterized by the differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) curve of FIG. 3. Crystalline Form II can be further characterized by the differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) curve of FIG. 8. Crystalline Form III can be further characterized by the differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) curve of FIG. 13. Crystalline Form IV can be further characterized by the differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) curve of FIG. 16. TGA Thermogravimetric data was acquired using a Perkin Elmer model TGA 7. Experiments were performed under a flow of nitrogen and using a heating rate of 10° C./min to a maximum temperature of approximately 250° C. After automatically taring the balance, 5 to 20 mg of sample was added to the platinum pan, the furnace was raised, and the heating program started. Weight/temperature data are collected automatically by the instrument. Analyses of the results were carried out by selecting the Delta Y function within the instrument software and choosing the temperatures between which the weight loss is to be calculated. Weight losses are reported up to the onset of decomposition/evaporation. Crystalline Form I can be further characterized by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of FIG. 2. Crystalline Form II can be further characterized by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of FIG. 7. Crystalline Form III can be further characterized by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of FIG. 12. Crystalline Form IV can be further characterized by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of FIG. 15. A representative sample of Form I was analyzed by DSC and TGA according to the methods described above. Form I displays one endotherm (melting of Form I confirmed by hot stage microscopy) with Tonset=173.48° C., Tpeak=175.32° C., and ΔH=82.28 J/g (FIG. 3). Thermogravimetric analysis exhibits insignificant weight loss between room temperature and melting point of Form I (FIG. 2). A representative sample of Form II was analyzed by DSC (FIG. 8) and TGA (FIG. 7) according to the methods described above. The first endotherm in the DSC curve is associated with the melting of Form II with Tonset=144.75° C., Tpeak=147.59° C., and ΔH=23.41 J/g (FIG. 11). The first endotherm is followed by a recrystallization event to produce Form I at ˜150° C. and finally by the melting of form I at Tonset=170.18° C., Tpeak=172.95° C., and ΔH=57.45 J/g. TG analysis exhibits minimum weight loss (trapped solvent) between room temperature and melting of Form I. DSC of Form III (FIG. 13) displays one endotherm associated with the melting of Form III with Tonset=164.30° C., Tpeak=169.38° C., and ΔH=23.41 J/g. Thermogravimetric analysis (FIG. 12) shows ˜1% w/w residual solvent in the initial material which was removed by heating at 140 C and holding for 10 min. DSC of Form IV (FIG. 16) displays one endotherm associated with the melting of Form IV with Tonset=171.25° C., Tpeak=172.30° C., and ΔH=84.64 J/g. Less than 1% weight loss is observed up to melting using TGA (FIG. 15). 1.
