N-(5-((4-(3,4-Dihydro-1H-[1,4]oxazino[4,3-a]indol-10-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl)amino)-2-(e thyl(2-(ethylamino)ethyl)amino)-4-methoxyphenyl)acrylamide
Embodiment 21D (180 mg, 273.64 µmol) was dissolved in DCM (5 mL) at 0 °C and TFA (1.54 g, 13.51 mmol) was slowly added to the mixture. After the addition was complete, the reaction solution was stirred at 25 °C for 12 hours. LCMS showed the reaction was complete. The reaction solution was concentrated and the crude product was dissolved in DCM (20 mL) and the pH was adjusted to 9 to 10 with saturated NaHCO3. The organic phase was separated and concentrated to give the crude product which was purified by preparative HPLC (FA) to deliver the title compound (yellow solid FA salt, 32.23 mg, yield 19.51%).
