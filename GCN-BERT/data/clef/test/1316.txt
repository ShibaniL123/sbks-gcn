It is also important that the display booths have sufficient structural integrity to be used safely during the show and the ability to be transported efficiently between uses. Further, it is desirable that booth technologies offer a wide choice of new and useful accessories, which can be used to further customize the booths. Standard wall systems for display booths feature either hard wall structures, or pipe and drape technologies. Hard wall systems require specialized assembly tools to open, close and/or adjust the components and are required to install accessories. Ladders are necessary to install the required top beams and headers of the system. Multiple sized crates are required for shipping and storing the system. Loading and unloading requires the use of dollies and overall the parts of the system are bulky and heavy making the components extremely difficult to pack, load and unload. In order for the system to provide custom designs, shop drawings are required. Standard pipe and drape systems are advantageous over the hard wall systems in that they do not require specialized assembly tools. However, this type of pipe and drape system requires multiple spotting of the bases and posts. Shipping requires heavy carriers in various sizes, resulting in large cargo loads and high transportation costs. Moreover, the pipe and drape type systems do not provide for accessories and have shown to be very unstable.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a modular wall system 10 for use in exhibitions, trade shows and the like configured for maximum design flexibility, ease of assembly and disassembly, and simplicity in packing and shipping. In its broadest context, the system 10 includes at least one upstanding column 30, at least one member 40 having an end 32 and means 60 for detachably connecting the end of the member 40 to the column. Preferably, the member 40 takes the forms of a panel, which may comprise either a wall panel designed to extend over the entire height of a side of the booth, from the top of the booth to the bottom, or header panel, designed to extend over a part of a side of the booth, downwardly from the top. FIG. 1 illustrates a basic single section embodiment of the modular wall system 10. In this embodiment, a substantially square booth design is provided having one open side for entry. The system 10 includes members 40 including three wall panels 40A, 40B, 40C and one header panel 40D. Each of the members 40 is connected at each end to one of the upstanding columns 30A, 30B, 30C, 30D. A connecting means, including a main bracket 60, detachably connects the end of each member 40 to a surface 32 of the upstanding column 30. FIGS. 2-8 illustrate the main bracket 60 of the connecting means of the system, which includes first and second interchangeable parts 62, 70. Preferably, the first part 62 is coupled to each end of the panel member, while the second part 70 is coupled to the surface of each column 30 to which the panel member is to be attached. FIGS. 2, 3 and 7 illustrate the first interchangeable part 62, which is preferably a female connection part having an open-faced slot 64 extending in a direction along the length of the surface 32 of the column. The open-faced slot 64 defines a channel 66 extending in a plane substantially parallel to the surface 32 of the column 30. Preferably, the open-faced slot 64 is substantially U-shaped. The open-faced slot 64 is defined by a side surface 69, which has an open top and a closed bottom. Channel 66 is situated in the side surface 69. FIGS. 4, 5 and 6 illustrate the second interchangeable part 70 of the main bracket 60, which is preferably a male connection part having an outwardly extending flange 72. The male part 70 has a shape corresponding to that of slot 64 and includes a side surface 74. Flange 72 extends outwardly from the side surface 74. As shown in FIG. 8, the male part 70 is received within the open-faced slot 64 of the female part 62, such that the outwardly extending flange 72 of the male part 70 is received within the channel 66 of the female part 62. Each of the female and male parts 62, 70 is mounted on a base 71 which has at least one opening 80 extending substantially therethrough for securing the part to the panel or column by a rivet or other like fastening means. Preferably, four openings 80 are provided on the base 71 of each of the parts 62, 70 to ensure a strong connection between the part and the column or panel to which it is attached. Referring to FIG. 9, the member 40 takes the form of a panel 40, which includes a frame 42. Frame 42 is formed of connected hollow frame parts 44, each having an end 45. Preferably, the hollow frame parts 44 are made of extruded aluminum. The ends of each pair of adjacent frame parts, such as frame parts 44A, 44B, are connected together by a corner connector 46. Preferably, each corner connector 46 is formed of substantially perpendicular sections 46A, 46B. Sections 46A and 46B are adapted to be received within the ends 45 respectively of the hollow frame parts 44 for connecting the frame parts together. Preferably, four parts 44, including two parallel spaced first parts 44A and two parallel spaced second parts 44B, are connected together by four corner connectors 46 to form a substantially rectangular frame 42. FIGS. 10A-10D illustrate the corner connector 46, which is preferably made from injection molded plastic. The first and second substantially perpendicular sections 46A, 46B are each adapted to be received within a different end 45 of one of the hollow frame parts 44 and to be securely held in place by at least one set screw, rivet 47 or other conventional fastener. Each corner connector 46 includes at least one, and preferably two, substantially circular guide holes 48 extending therethrough for accepting the rivet 47. The base 71 of the female part 62 of each main bracket 60 is coupled to the end portion of each opposing hollow frame part 44 of the panel 40. More specifically, the female part 62 extends outwardly from the frame part 44 at a location approximately nine inches from the end 45 of the frame part. Panels 40 may take the form of either wall panels 40A, 40B, 40C or header panels 40D depending on the design specifications of the system. When closed sides are required, wall panels are utilized. When opened sides are desired, header panels are utilized. The height of the second frame parts 44B of the frame 42 differs depending on whether a header 40D or a wall panel 40A is being provided. FIG. 11 illustrates the header 40D. Header 40D provides added stability and support to the structure of the system 10, while at the same time creates an opening for allowing access to the booth. In addition, header 40D may be used for displaying signage, advertizing messages or special verbiage. FIG. 12 illustrates an upstanding column 30 of the modular system. During construction of the booth, column 30 is detachably connected to one, two, three or four panels 40. Column 30 is configured to be universally adaptable within the system for connecting with wall panels 40A, header panels 40D, or accessories without modification. A support 90, shown in FIG. 22, is adapted to extend between the columns, specifically from one column 30C to a second column 30E in order to provide additional support and stability to the system 10. Column 30 is also adaptable for connecting with support 90. Column 30 is a substantially elongated hollow aluminum member having a top end 31A and a bottom end 31B and at least one side surface 32. The bottom end 31B preferably includes an adjustable foot 33 for altering the height of the column in order to accommodate unevenly spaced flooring. In the preferred embodiment, shown in FIG. 13, the cross-sectional shape of the column 30 is substantially square, being defined by four side surfaces 32. Each of the four side surfaces 32 includes three outwardly extending male parts 70 spaced along the surface. The first male parts 70A extend outwardly from each side surface 32 of the column proximate the top end 31A. More specifically, the first male parts 70A are approximately ¾ inch from the top end of the column. The second male parts 70B extend outwardly from each side surface 32 of the column proximate the top end 31A and a short distance below the first male parts 70A. More specifically, the second male parts 70B are approximately nine inches from the top end 31A of the column. The third male parts 70C extend outwardly from each side surface 32 of the column proximate the bottom end 31B. More specifically, the third male parts 70C are located approximately eleven inches from the bottom end of the column. The female parts 62 are preferably coupled to the ends 45 of each panel 40, and adapted to engage selected ones of the male parts 70 extending from the surfaces 32 of columns 30. As such, the outwardly extending flange 72 of the male part 70 is adapted to be received within the channel 66 of the female part 62. Thus, the female parts 62 of the panels 40 interengageably connect with the male parts 70 of the columns 30. FIGS. 14 and 15 illustrate alternate embodiments of the upstanding column 30 of the system, where outwardly extending male parts 70 are provided along three sides of the column (shown in FIG. 14) or are provided along two sides of the column (shown in FIG. 15). In alternate embodiments, the locations of the female parts and of the male parts may be reversed such that the female parts 62 are coupled to columns 30 and the male parts 70 are fixed to the panel frames. However, in order to provide universal integration of the columns, panels and headers within the system, it is necessary for all columns to contain either male or female parts exclusively, while members of the frame of the panels and headers contain oppositely engaging parts. It should be understood that providing columns 30 with a substantially square cross-section enables the walls and headers to be positioned in perpendicular configuration to one another, allowing square and rectangular booths to be configured. FIGS. 16 and 17 illustrate alternate embodiment of the upstanding column 30H of the present system, where the column 30H includes a substantially triangular cross-section. The bottom end 35B of the upstanding triangular column 30H includes an adjustable foot 33 for altering the height of the column for accommodating unevenly spaced flooring. In this alternate embodiment, the triangular cross-section of the column 30H defines three side surfaces 35. Each of the three side surfaces 35 includes three outwardly extending male parts 70. The first male parts 70A extend outwardly from each side surface 35 of the column proximate the top end 35A. More specifically, the first male parts 70A are approximately ¾ inch from the top end of the column. The second male parts 70B extend outwardly from each side surface 35 of the column proximate the top end 35A and a short distance below the first male parts 70A. More specifically, the second male parts 70B are approximately nine inches from the top end of the column. The third male parts 70C extend outwardly from each side surface 35 of the column proximate the bottom end 35B. More specifically, the third male parts 70C are approximately eleven inches from the bottom end of the column. FIGS. 18 and 19 illustrate alternate embodiments of the upstanding triangular column 30H of the system, where outwardly extending male parts 70 are provided along two side surfaces of the column (shown in FIG. 18) or provided along one side surface of the column (shown in FIG. 19). It should be understood that providing the column 30H with a substantially triangular cross-section enables the walls and headers to be positioned in non-perpendicular configuration to one another, allowing alternate shaped booths to be configured. Alternative columns are contemplated herein having cross-sectional configurations, including but not limited to, circular, square, rectangular, hexagonal, octagonal, and oval. FIG. 20 illustrates the panel 40 of the modular wall system, which includes the frame 42 and fabric covering 50.

The system 10 includes three wall panels 40A, 40B, 40C and one header panel 40D, secured at each end by the upstanding columns 30A, 30B, 30C, 30D. The main bracket 60 of the connecting means detachably connects the ends of each panel 40 to the surface 32 of the upstanding column 30. FIG. 22 illustrates a two-section embodiment of the modular wall system defining a substantially rectangular booth with an open side. The system 10 includes three wall panels 40A, 40B, 40C and three headers 40D, 40E, 40F, secured at each end by the upstanding columns 30A, 30B, 30C, 30D, 30E, 30F. The columns 30 are detachably connected at each end 32 of the header 40D and wall panels 40A, 40B, 40C by the main bracket 60 of the connecting means. Support 90 is adapted to extend between the columns, specifically from one column 30C to a second column 30E in order to provide additional support and stability to the system 10. A sign 91 is provided for displaying the name of the booth thereon and includes an elongated support 93 for insertion into the top end 31A of the hollow column 30D. The support 90, illustrated in FIG. 24, is composed of extruded aluminum and is hollow. The support 90 includes two ends 92 and extends between columns 30C, 30E as illustrated in FIGS. 22-23. FIGS. 27A, 27B illustrate a means for detachably connecting the ends of the support to the surfaces of the columns 30. The support connecting means includes use of female connecting brackets 62A for joining the ends of the support 90 to the surfaces of columns 30. The female connecting bracket 62A is substantially similar in design to the female part 62, including an open-faced slot 64A extending in a direction along the length of the surface 32 of the column. The open-faced slot 64A defines a channel 66A extending in a plane substantially parallel to the surface 32 of the column 30. Preferably, the open-faced slot 64A is substantially U-shaped. The open slot-faced slot 64A is defined by a side surface 69A, such that the channel 66A is situated in the side surface 69A. The female connecting bracket 62A further includes an elongated ribbed securing member 63 extending outwardly therefrom. The securing member 63 of the female connecting bracket 62A is received within the ends 92 of the support 90, for joining the support 90 to the column 30. More specifically, as discussed supra, the male parts 70 are coupled to the side surfaces 32 of the column 30, such that the outwardly extending flange 72 of the male part 70 is adapted to be received within the channel 66A of the female connecting part 62A. Thus, the female connecting bracket 62A within the ends of the support 90 interengageable connects with the male parts 70 of the columns 30. In a modular wall system having a generally square or rectangular configuration, as illustrated in FIGS. 22, 25, 26 and 27A, 27B, the elongated ribbed securing member 63 extends outwardly from the female connecting bracket 62A in a generally perpendicular direction. In FIGS. 27A and 27B, the ribbed securing members 63 are adaptable for insertion into the ends 92 of a support 90 which extends generally perpendicularly between two columns 30C, 30D. A rivet 102, set screw or other conventional fastener may be used for more permanently securing the female connecting bracket 62A into the hollow end 92 of the support 90. FIGS. 28A and 28B illustrate two female connecting brackets of the type used for joining mitered ends 92 of a support to the columns. As shown in FIGS. 29 and 30, the support 90 is able to extend at a forty-five degree angle from one column 30F to another column 30G. The ribbed securing members 63 are received within the mitered ends of 92 of the support 90 for joining the ends of the support 90 to the columns 30 when the two columns 30C, 30D are not perpendicular one another.
