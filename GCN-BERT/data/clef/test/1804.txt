Synthesis of 1,4,7,10-tetrakis(anthracen-9-ylmethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane
K2CO3 (400 mg, 2.9 mmol) and 9-(chloromethyl)anthracene (655 mg, 2.9 mmol) were added to a stirred solution of cyclen (100 mg, 0.58 mmol) in anhydrous toluene (15 mL), and the resulting solution was heated under reflux for 16 hours under N2 atmosphere. Formation of a new product was confirmed by TLC [stationary phase = Silica TLC, mobile phase = EtOAc]. The resulting product was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure and dichloromethane (50 mL) was added. The resulting product was shaken well with water and the separated organic layer was dried over MgSO4. Column chromatography was used to obtain a pure compound (270 mg, 50%).
