Example 25
To a suspension of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.100 g, 0.408 mmol) and 4-phenylthiazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.092 g, 0.448 mmol), and pyridine (0.15 mL, 1.832 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.85 mL, 1.432 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 50Â° C. for 6 days. After cooling, the mixture was quenched with water (3 mL) and the precitate was collected by filtration washing with cold 1:1 acetonitrile/water mixture. The residue was purified by precipitating in dichloromethane and filtration to give N-(4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)-4-phenylthiazole-5-carboxamide (0.151 g, 86%) as a yellow solid.
