121.7: 5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-1-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-3-[(S)-1-methyl-2-(3-methyl-oxetan-3-ylamino)-ethyl]-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (compound 121)
10 mg (0.1 mmol) of 1-oxy-pyridin-2-ol and 21 mg (0.1 mmol) of 7-methoxy-3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one (prepared as in example 115.6) are added to a solution containing 30 mg (0.1 mmol) of [5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-[(S)-1-methyl-2-(3-methyl-oxetan-3-ylamino)-ethyl]-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid in 0.6 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide. 17.6 mg (0.1 mmol) of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride is added, and stirring is maintained for 20 hours at room temperature. The mixture is poured into water and then extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase is washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate and then rinsed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, then filtered and concentrated to dryness. After purification by silica gel chromatography eluted with a mixture of methanol in dichloromethane, following a polarity gradient (from 0% to 10% of methanol in dichloromethane), 18 mg (37%) of 5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-1-[2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl]-3-[(S)-1-methyl-2-(3-methyl-oxetan-3-ylamino)-ethyl]-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a white solid.
