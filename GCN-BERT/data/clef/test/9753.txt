CONSUMER PRODUCTS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a consumer product comprising a porous dissolvable solid structure and a hydrophobic coating applied thereto. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Consumer products often contain benefit agents, such as conditioning agents or perfume, to provide enhancements to surfaces treated with the consumer product such as improved hand feel benefits (e.g. soft, silky feel), odor control benefits, and the like. Such benefits are desired by consumers of products such as hair care products, like shampoo or hair conditioners, and fabric care products, such as laundry detergents or fabric softeners. Such consumer products are typically provided in the form of aqueous liquid products. Since many desirable benefit agents are hydrophobic in nature, it can be a challenge to create a stable aqueous liquid formulation containing hydrophobic benefit agents. As a result, such benefit agents are typically incorporated in aqueous liquid compositions in the form of emulsions or other systems comprising emulsion droplets/particles having relatively small particle size benefits agents. One drawback of having small particle size benefit agents is that it can be difficult to deposit and retain small particle size benefit agents on the treated surface, especially if the surfaces are being treated in the context of an aqueous treatment liquor such as a detergent treatment liquor in a washing machine or a treatment liquor that a consumer uses in the shower when shampooing and/or conditioning her hair. As a result, the small particle size benefit agents can be easily washed down the drain and therefore wasted, as opposed to being deposited and retained on surfaces to enhance the surface. Past attempts to enhance deposition of relatively small particle size benefits agents have generally relied on the use of deposition aids and/or coacervates, such as cationic polymers and/or complexes formed between deposition aids and other ingredients in the treatment liquor. This approach suffers from a disadvantage in that such deposition aids and/or coacervates may be undesirable on the treated surface, may increase cost or complexity of the consumer product, or may create other issues such as material incompatibilities. In order to address such drawbacks, attempts have been made to provide delivery systems, such as encapsulation systems, for the hydrophobic benefit agents in order to enhance their deposition and retention on surfaces while remaining stable in an aqueous liquid product. These delivery systems, however, can limit the effectiveness of the benefit agents or lead to other issues. It is therefore desired to provide a consumer product that can provide an aqueous treatment liquor having relatively large particle size benefit agents without the need for liquid delivery systems that can interfere with the effectiveness of the benefit agent being deposited on the treated surfaces. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a consumer product comprising (a) a porous dissolvable solid structure, and (b) a hydrophobic coating comprising a first benefit agent and a second benefit agent. The hydrophobic coating is applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure. The first benefit agent and the second benefit agent are premixed to form the hydrophobic coating before the hydrophobic coating is applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure. The consumer product can be dissolved in an aqueous solution to form an aqueous treatment liquor. Upon dissolution, the hydrophobic coating can be transformed from a liquid film coating into large discrete particles by action on (via dissolution and/or shear) the solid structure supporting the hydrophobic coating dissolving in the aqueous solution. The relatively large particles of benefit agent can be more effectively deposited on the treated surfaces and therefore provide enhanced consumer benefits, as compared to products which provide smaller particle size benefit agents. The present invention further relates to a method of forming an aqueous treatment liquor comprising a benefit agent, the method comprising the steps of: (a) providing a consumer product comprising: (i) a porous dissolvable solid structure, and (ii) a hydrophobic coating comprising a first benefit agent and a second benefit agent, wherein the hydrophobic coating is applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure, and wherein the first benefit agent and the second benefit agent are premixed to form the hydrophobic coating before the hydrophobic coating is applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure.; (b) providing an aqueous solution; and (c) dissolving said consumer product in said aqueous solution to form an aqueous treatment liquor comprising a hydrophobic portion and an aqueous portion.

HYDROPHOBIC COATING The consumer product of the present invention comprises a hydrophobic coating comprising two or more benefit agents (e.g. a first benefit agent and a second benefit agent). The benefit agents are premixed to form the hydrophobic coating. The benefit agents can comprise a variety of materials, such as conditioning agents, perfume, and the like.

VISCOSITY MODIFIER The hydrophobic coating of the present invention may comprise at least one viscosity modifier. A viscosity modifier is any material which may be incorporated into the hydrophobic coating that alters its rheological properties. Non-limiting examples of rheological properties that may be modified by the viscosity modifier include but are not limited to decreasing or increasing the viscosity of the hydrophobic coating and/or increasing or decreasing one or more yield-points of the hydrophobic coating and/or otherwise altering the shear characteristics of the hydrophobic coating. The viscosity modifier may be miscible in the hydrophobic coating. Without being bound by theory it is believed that manipulating the rheological properties of the hydrophobic coating may impact the dispersibility of the hydrophobic coating during use. Specifically, decreasing the viscosity of the hydrophobic coating can lead to lower shear required to disperse the hydrophobic coating and/or yield smaller (yet still relatively large) particles of the dispersed hydrophobic coating in the aqueous liquor resulting from the dispersion of the consumer product of the present invention in an aqueous system. Alternately, increasing the viscosity of the hydrophobic coating may increase the particle size of the dispersed hydrophobic coating in the aqueous liquor resulting from the dispersion of the consumer product of the present invention in an aqueous system. As such, manipulating the viscosity of the hydrophobic coating is one means to manipulate the in-use requirements of the consumer product of the present invention and/or the particle size of the dispersed hydrophobic coating in the aqueous liquor resulting from the dispersion of the consumer product of the present invention in an aqueous system. Further, it is separately believed that increasing the particle size of the hydrophobic coating in said aqueous liquor may increase deposition of the benefit agent comprising said hydrophobic coating during use. As such, it is believed that manipulating the viscosity of the hydrophobic coating allows that the aqueous liquor resulting from the dispersion of the consumer product of the present invention in an aqueous system may be, on the one hand, more easily formed (e.g. decreased viscosity) or, on the other hand, more effectively deposited from said aqueous liquor during use (e.g. increased viscosity).

HYDROPHOBIC COATING SURFACTANT The hydrophobic coating of the present invention can optionally comprise surfactant. Incorporating surfactant in the hydrophobic coating may, upon dissolution of the consumer product, serve to reduce the interfacial tension between the hydrophobic portion and the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor resulting from dissolution of the consumer product. Further, by reducing this interfacial tension, the hydrophobic coating may be more easily dispersed in said aqueous liquor (e.g. requiring reduced shear). In addition, in manipulating said interfacial tension, the resulting particle size of the dispersed benefit agent in the aqueous treatment liquor can be manipulated. To illustrate, reducing the interfacial tension may tend to reduce the particle size of the dispersed benefit agent in said aqueous treatment liquor and likewise decreasing the interfacial tension may tend to increase the particle size of the dispersed benefit agent in the aqueous treatment liquor. Further, increasing the particle size of benefit agent in said aqueous treatment liquor may tend to increase deposition of the benefit agent during use. As such, it is believed that manipulating the interfacial tension between the hydrophobic portion and the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor resulting from dissolution of the consumer product may allow, on the one hand, the dispersion to be more easily formed (e.g. decreased interfacial tension) or, on the other hand, the benefit agent to be more effectively deposited from said aqueous liquor during use (e.g. increased interfacial tension).

Other amphoterics may be those of the dialkyl type including either phospholipids, i.e., based on glycerol and sphingosine, or glycolipid, i.e. based on sphingosine. Phospholipids are preferred with phosphatidyl choline (lecithin) being the preferred phospholipid.

Gemini surfactants are made up of two hydrocarbon chains (generally, C12-C22) and two polar head groups linked by a short spacer. The spacer is attached directly to the polar head groups, each of which is in turn bonded to a hydrocarbon chain. The spacer can vary in length, hydrophobicity and flexibility and is typical a C2-C5 divalent alkyl radical. A typical Gemini surfactant is depicted as follows: Gemini surfactants are also described further in the book: Surfactants and Polymers in Aqueous Solution, by Bo Jonsson, Bjorn Lindman, Krister Holmberg and Bengt Kronberg, pages 4-5, John Wiley and Sons, copyright 1998. The hydrophobic coatings of the consumer products of the present invention may be comprised of one or more surfactants. The surfactant(s) may comprise from about 1 to 20% by weight, preferably from 2 to 10% by weight, more preferably from 3 to 5% by weight of the hydrophobic coating. VISCOSITY OF HYDROPHOBIC COATING The hydrophobic coating utilized in the present invention will generally have a viscosity of less than about 500 Pa s (500,000 centipoise), less than about 350 Pa s (350,000 centipoise), less than about 200 Pa-s (200,000 centipoise), less than about 100 Pa-s (100,000 centipoise), less than about 50 Pa-s (50,000 centipoise), or less than about 30 Pa-s (30,000 centipoise). In one aspect, the hydrophobic coating will preferably have a viscosity of less than 14.5 Pa-s (14,500 centipoise), less than about 12 Pa-s (12,000 centipoise), less than about 11 Pa-s (11,000 centipoise), less than about 10 Pa-s (10,000 centipoise), less than about 5 Pa-s (5,000 centipoise), or less than about 1 Pa-s (1,000 centipoise). If the viscosity of the hydrophobic coating is too high, upon dissolution of the dissolvable structure, the hydrophobic coating will tend not to sufficiently form the desired large particles and instead will tend to remain in a more continuous form. The relatively lower viscosity of the hydrophobic coating may facilitate more complete break-up of the hydrophobic coating during dissolution/use of the consumer product, particularly in use environments that include relatively lower shear. Further, it is believed that the relatively lower viscosity of the hydrophobic coating may also allow for faster break-up of the hydrophobic coating upon dissolution of the consumer product during use. It is further believed that both completeness and speed of break-up of the hydrophobic coating may be facilitated by introducing shear to the hydrophobic coating during use, particularly during the portion of use during which the porous dissolvable solid structure is being dissolved. The viscosity of the hydrophobic coating is determined according to the VISCOSITY TEST METHOD described hereinbelow. THICKNESS OF HYDROPHOBIC COATING The hydrophobic coating of the present invention is preferably applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure in a manner such that the average thickness and/or maximum thickness of the hydrophobic coating of the consumer product is less than about 1,000 micron, less than about 500 microns, less than about 100 microns, or less than about 50 microns. As used herein, the term "thickness" with respect to the hydrophobic coating means the distance between the solid structure outer-facing surface and the hydrophobic coating outer-facing surface. As the porous dissolvable solid structure is porous, the hydrophobic coating may tend to migrate from the outer-facing surface of the porous dissolvable solid structure as applied into the interstitial pores of the porous dissolvable solid structure. In one aspect, the average thickness of the hydrophobic coating of the consumer product is zero, indicating that the hydrophobic coating may be fully migrated into the interstitial pores of the porous dissolvable solid structure. The hydrophobic coating, if too thick, may fail to disperse adequately upon dissolution of the consumer product resulting in uneven distribution of the benefit agent(s) on the surface treated with the aqueous treatment liquor. This uneven distribution can result in consumer negatives such as spotting of fabrics or inadequate or uneven conditioning of hair. Minimizing the thickness of the hydrophobic coating can be particularly important when the viscosity of the hydrophobic coating is relatively high, e.g., at least about 10 Pa s, at least about 15 Pa s, at least about 100 Pa s, or at least about 300 Pa s. The thickness of the hydrophobic coating is determined according to the THICKNESS OF HYDROPHOBIC COATING TEST METHOD hereinbelow. AREA DENSITY OF APPLICATION The hydrophobic coating is preferably applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure in an amount and manner to provide an area density of application of the applied hydrophobic coating of less than about 250 micrograms ^g) per square millimeter (mm2), preferably less than about 150 μg per mm2, preferably less than about 120 μg per mm2, preferably less than 100 μg per mm2, of porous dissolvable solid structure. The area density of application of the hydrophobic coating is the weight of all materials in the hydrophobic coating(s), relative to the surface area of the porous dissolvable solid structure in the zone which is directly supporting that weight of hydrophobic coating. For purposes of determining the area density of application of the hydrophobic coating, the surface area of the porous dissolvable solid structure is considered to be planar and contiguous. As the porous dissolvable solid structure is porous, the hydrophobic coating may tend to migrate from the outer-facing surface of the porous dissolvable solid structure as applied into the interstitial pores of the porous dissolvable solid structure. If more than one surface of the porous dissolvable solid structure is coated, then the surface area of all the coated surfaces is used in the calculation. The hydrophobic coating has an area density of application that is reported in units of μg per mm2. If the amount of hydrophobic coating applied per area of dissolvable structure is too high, upon dissolution of the dissolvable structure, the hydrophobic coating will not sufficiently form the desired large particles and instead will tend to remain in a more continuous form. This can lead to the hydrophobic coating not effectively depositing on the treated surface or can lead to too much of the hydrophobic coating being deposited per area of treated surface, which in turn can lead to issues such as an undesireable hand feel (e.g. greasy feel) of the treated substrate or can lead to spotting of the treated surfaces (such as spotting of fabrics). The hydrophobic coating may be applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure in any of a number of shapes including but not limited to geometric patterns such as stripes, dots, donut- shapes, triangles, rectangles, squares wavy-lines, arcs, z-patterns, and combinations thereof. Alternately, the hydrophobic coating may be applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure so as to form representations of recognizable images such as flowers, birds, smiley-faces, and the like. Alternately, the hydrophobic coating may be applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure so as to form representations of commercial images such as logos, indicia, slogans and the like. Alternately, the hydrophobic coating may be applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure so as to form representations of letters and/or numbers including words that may comprise sayings, inspirational messages, jokes, or usage instructions. In a preferred aspect, the hydrophobic coating may be applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure as a plurality of stripes. FIGS. 1A and IB represent a top-view of two non- limiting examples of an oval shaped consumer product comprising a porous dissolvable solid structure and a hydrophobic coating applied as stripes to the porous dissolvable solid structure (e.g. in 5-stripe and 4-stripe patterns). The hydrophobic coating can be applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure via a variety of different processes known to those of skill in the art, such as slot coating, roll coating, nip coating, dip coating, knife coating, brush coating, printing (e.g. gravure printing, flexographic printing, inkjet printing, and the like), spraying, spiral/omega jet coating, and the like. LOADING The consumer product of the present invention typically comprises hydrophobic coating applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure in an amount (i.e. total amount of hydrophobic coating(s)) of from about 1% to about 70%, from about 4% to about 70%, from about 5% to about 50%, from about 5% to about 30%, or from about 5% to about 20%, by weight of the consumer product. MULTIPLE BENEFIT AGENTS The consumer product of the present invention comprises a hydrophobic coating that comprises two or more benefit agents (e.g. a first benefit agent and a second benefit agent). The benefit agents are premixed together to form the hydrophobic coating, before the hydrophobic coating is applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure. In one aspect, the hydrophobic coating comprises silicone as a first benefit agent and perfume as a second benefit agent, wherein the silicone and perfume are premixed to form the hydrophobic coating, and then the hydrophobic coating is applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure. The consumer product of the present invention may further comprise two or more hydrophobic coatings, each comprising a benefit agent(s). In this aspect, each hydrophobic coating (e.g. a first hydrophobic coating, a second hydrophobic coating, etc.) is discretely applied to the porous dissolvable solid structure. The hydrophobic coatings can be applied on the same surface of the porous dissolvable solid structure or can be applied on different surfaces of the porous dissolvable solid structure. If applied on the same surface of the porous dissolvable solid structure, the hydrophobic coatings can be applied adjacent to one another. In this regard, the hydrophobic coatings can be directly adjacent (e.g. side -by-side), partially or completely overlap each other (e.g. a second hydrophobic coating discretely applied on top of a first hydrophobic coating), or be spaced apart (e.g. first and second hydrophobic coatings separated by surface area of the porous dissolvable solid structure without having any hydrophobic coating). In a preferred aspect, for example, the consumer product comprises a first hydrophobic coating comprising a silicone (e.g. a terminal aminosilicone) and a second hydrophobic coating comprising a perfume. In one aspect, the silicone coating is applied as spaced apart stripes and the perfume coating is applied as stripes adjacent and in-between the silicone coating stripes. In one aspect, the perfume coating is applied directed to the outer-facing surface of the porous dissolvable solid structure and the silicone coating is applied on top of the perfume coating (i.e. the silicone and perfume is not premixed). In one aspect, the silicone coating is applied on a top outer-facing surface and the perfume coating is applied on a bottom outer-facing surface of the porous dissolvable solid structure. METHOD OF FORMING AQUEOUS TREATMENT LIQUOR The present invention further encompasses a method of forming an aqueous treatment liquor by dissolving the consumer product. The aqueous treatment liquor can be, for example, an aqueous laundry treatment liquor formed in a washing machine or hand-washing vessel, an aqueous hair treatment liquor formed by a consumer in the shower, an aqueous body treatment liquor formed by a consumer in the shower, an aqueous dish treatment liquor formed in a washing machine or hand-washing vessel, and the like. The method generally comprises the steps of providing a consumer product of the present invention, providing an aqueous solution, and dissolving the consumer product in the aqueous solution. As the method steps are carried out, the dissolvable structure of the consumer product begins to dissolve in the aqueous solution. As the dissolvable structure dissolves away, the hydrophobic coating applied to the structure begins to break apart, thereby forming relatively large particles of benefit agent. It is the resulting relatively large particles of benefit agent in the aqueous treatment liquor that result in significant improvements in providing the desired benefits to the consumer of the consumer product, such as hair conditioning or fabric softening. In forming the aqueous treatment liquor by dissolving the dissolvable structure of the consumer product, the method preferably further comprises the step of shearing of the aqueous treatment liquor. The shearing of the aqueous treatment liquor can be important to further facilitate break-up of the hydrophobic coating into the desired large particles. The shearing can be accomplished by mechanically manipulating (e.g. by machine or by hand) the aqueous treatment liquor (e.g. agitation), preferably during dissolution of the porous dissolvable solid structure. The shear rate can be tailored depending upon the method of treating the surface (e.g. machine vs. hand manipulation). In one aspect, the aqueous treatment liquor is sheared at a shear rate of from about 5 s"1 to about 250 s"1. In one aspect, the shear rate is zero s"1. In achieving the relatively large particles of benefit agent, factors such as viscosity of the hydrophobic coating, viscosity of the aqueous portion of the resulting aqueous treatment liquor, ratio of the viscosity of the hydrophobic coating to the viscosity of the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor, the viscosity of the hydrophobic portion in the resulting aqueous treatment liquor, and the like, can impact the effective formation of large benefit agent particles. The Capillary Number provided by the method, as described in detail below, can also impact the effective deposition of the large benefit agent particles on the treated surface, as the Capillary Number includes some of the above factors and others such as shear rate, droplet particle size, interfacial tension between the aqueous treatment liquor and the benefit agent, and the like. In one aspect, the method of forming an aqueous treatment liquor comprising a benefit agent comprises the steps of: (a) providing a consumer product comprising: (i) a porous dissolvable solid structure, and (ii) a hydrophobic coating comprising a benefit agent, said hydrophobic coating applied to said porous dissolvable solid structure, wherein said hydrophobic coating has a first viscosity, (b) providing an aqueous solution, (c) dissolving said consumer product in said aqueous solution to form an aqueous treatment liquor comprising a hydrophobic portion and an aqueous portion, wherein said aqueous portion has a second viscosity, wherein a ratio of said first viscosity to said second viscosity is less than about 100:1. In one aspect, the method of forming an aqueous treatment liquor comprising a benefit agent comprises the steps of: (a) providing a consumer product comprising: (i) a porous dissolvable solid structure, and (ii) a hydrophobic coating comprising a benefit agent, said hydrophobic coating applied to said porous dissolvable solid structure, (b) providing an aqueous solution, (c) dissolving said consumer product in said aqueous solution to form an aqueous treatment liquor, wherein said method provides a Capillary Number of less than 1000. In one aspect, the method of forming an aqueous treatment liquor comprising a benefit agent comprises the steps of: (a) providing a consumer product comprising: (i) a porous dissolvable solid structure, and (ii) a hydrophobic coating comprising a benefit agent, said hydrophobic coating applied to said porous dissolvable solid structure, (b) providing an aqueous solution, (c) dissolving said consumer product in said aqueous solution to form an aqueous treatment liquor comprising a hydrophobic portion and an aqueous portion, wherein said hydrophobic portion of said aqueous treatment liquor has a viscosity of less than about 14.5 Pa s, preferably less than about 12 Pa s, preferably less than about 11 Pa s, preferably less than about 10 Pa-s, preferably less than about 5 Pa-s, and preferably less than about 1 Pa-s. In one aspect, the method of forming an aqueous treatment liquor comprising a benefit agent comprises the steps of: (a) providing a consumer product comprising: (i) a porous dissolvable solid structure, and (ii) a hydrophobic coating comprising a benefit agent, said hydrophobic coating applied to said porous dissolvable solid structure, (b) providing an aqueous solution, (c) dissolving said consumer product in said aqueous solution to form an aqueous treatment liquor, wherein said aqueous treatment liquor comprises particles having a particle size of from about 10 microns to about 500 microns. PARTICLE SIZE IN AQUEOUS TREATMENT LIQUOR The methods of forming an aqueous treatment liquor of the present invention will preferably result in an aqueous treatment liquor comprising particles, e.g. benefit agent particles, having a particle size of from about 10 microns to about 500 microns, from about 30 microns to about 200 microns, from about 50 microns to about 150 microns, or from about 50 microns to about 100 microns. If the resulting particles in the aqueous treatment liquor have a particle size that is too small, then the benefit agent tends not to effectively deposit on the treated surface (especially without the use of other agents such as deposition aids and/or coacervates). For example, with respect to a laundry aqueous treatment liquor in a washing machine or a hair aqueous treatment liquor in the shower, the benefit agent will tend not to deposit on fabrics or hair and instead will tend to be rinsed down the drain. The consumer therefore will not realize the full potential benefits of the benefit agent. If the resulting particles in the aqueous treatment liquor have a particle size that is too large, then the benefit agent tends to provide undesireable issues on the treated surface, such as undesireable hand feel (e.g. greasy feel) or spotting of the treated surface (such as spotting on fabrics). The particle size of the particles, e.g. benefit agent particles, in the aqueous treatment liquor is determined according to PARTICLE SIZE TEST METHOD described hereinbelow. Note that the particle size ranges measured, reported, and claimed herein are based on radii (or equivalent radii) of the particles, rather than diameters (or equivalent diameters) of the particles. AQUEOUS PORTION OF AQUEOUS TREATMENT LIQUOR VISCOSITY The resulting aqueous treatment liquor of the present invention has an aqueous portion that preferably has a viscosity of from about 0.001 Pa s to about 5 Pa s. It is believed that viscosity of the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor can impact the completeness and/or speed of break-up of the hydrophobic coating during use, particularly under shear conditions. Increasing the viscosity of the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor tends to increase the efficiency of energy-transfer through the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor to the hydrophobic coating, thereby increasing completeness and/or speed of break-up of the hydrophobic coating during use, especially when the aqueous treatment liquor is sheared. The viscosity of the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor may be manipulated (e.g. increased), for example, by incorporating viscosity modifiers into the porous dissolvable solid structure, thereby increasing the viscosity of the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor upon dissolution of the consumer product. In particular, it is believed that the relative viscosities of the hydrophobic coating and the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor may also impact the completeness and the speed of break-up of the hydrophobic coating during use, particularly under shear. For example, increasing the viscosity of the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor, relative to the viscosity of the hydrophobic coating, tends to increase completeness and/or speed of break-up of the hydrophobic coating during use, especially when the aqueous treatment liquor is sheared. As such, a relatively lower viscosity ratio of the viscosity of the hydrophobic coating to the viscosity of the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor can lead to more effective break-up of the hydrophobic coating. The viscosity of the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor is determined according to the VISCOSITY TEST METHOD described hereinbelow. RATIO OF HYDROPHOBIC COATING VISCOSITY TO AQUEOUS PORTION VISCOSITY A ratio of the viscosity of the hydrophobic coating to the viscosity of the aqueous portion of the resulting aqueous treatment liquor is preferably less than about 100:1, less than about 50:1, less than about 10:1, less than about 5:1, or less than about 1:5. As noted above, it is believed that dispersion of the hydrophobic coating as relatively large particles in the aqueous treatment liquor may be facilitated when the relative viscosities of the hydrophobic coating and the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor are such that the ratio of said viscosities is less than 100:1. It would be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that this ratio can be impacted by either manipulating the viscosity of said hydrophobic coating and/or by manipulating said viscosity of the aqueous portion of said aqueous treatment liquor. CAPILLARY NUMBER In use, the consumer product of the present invention is dissolved in aqueous solution to form an aqueous treatment liquor. The hydrophobic coating of the consumer product tends to constitute a dispersed hydrophobic portion (e.g. as droplets) of the aqueous treatment liquor, while the porous dissolvable solid structure of the consumer product dissolves into the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor. In use, shearing forces apply a force to the aqueous treatment liquor. If the shear rate is large enough, then the force attempts to pull or stretch droplets of the hydrophobic portion. If stretched far enough, the droplets of hydrophobic portion will break into smaller droplets. At the same time, the droplets of hydrophobic portion try to resist stretching through the interfacial tension between the hydrophobic portion and the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor (as determined by the INTERFACIAL TENSION TEST METHOD described hereinbelow). These fluid flow dynamics are captured in the "Capillary Number". The Capillary Number is defined by the following equation: τμύ Ca = Y wherein: Ca is the Capillary Number (unitless), r is the Radius of Sheared Hydrophobic Portion Droplets (in meters), υ is the fixed Shear Rate of 100 (in s"1), γ is the Interfacial Tension between the Aqueous Portion of the Aqueous Treatment Liquor and Hydrophobic Portion of the Aqueous Treatment Liquor (in N- m_1 ), and μ is the Viscosity of the Aqueous Portion of the Aqueous Treatment Liquor (in Pa s). If the Capillary Number is relatively high, the force acting on the droplets of hydrophobic portion is relatively large and the droplets are likely to stretch and break into smaller droplets. If, on the other hand, the Capillary Number is relatively low, then the droplets tend to remain the same, relatively larger size in the aqueous treatment liquor. It has been found that providing relatively larger particle size benefit agents in the aqueous treatment liquor herein can be achieved when the Capillary Number than is less than 1,000, preferably less than 500, preferably less than 300, or preferably less than 100. The relatively larger particle size benefit agents tend to deposit more effectively and therefore provide enhanced consumer benefits as compared to benefit agents having relatively small particle size. The Capillary Number is determined according to the CAPILLARY NUMBER CALCULATION described hereinbelow. TEST METHODS The following test methods are conducted on samples that have been conditioned in a conditioned room at a temperature of 23° C + 2.0° C and a relative humidity of 45% + 10% for a minimum of 24 hours prior to testing. Except where noted, all tests are conducted under the same environmental conditions and in such conditioned room. Except where noted, all quantities are given on a weight basis. Except where noted all water used is laboratory-grade deionized (DI) water. Except where noted, at least three samples are measured for any given material being tested and the results from those three (or more) replicates are averaged to give the final reported value for that material, for that test. FORMING AN AQUEOUS TREATMENT LIQUOR For purposes of the test methods below, aqueous treatment liquor is generated according to the following procedure. The consumer product is combined with 38 °C deionized water in a glass container, at an article:water ratio of 1:7 (wt/wt). The container is sealed and loaded onto an orbital shaker mixing device, such as the VWR Model 3500, Catalog no. 89032-092 (VWR, Radnor, Pennsylvania, U.S.A.). The solution is then shaken for 24 hours at a speed setting of approximately 85 revolutions /min. The resulting solution is considered to be freshly-made, well-mixed aqueous treatment liquor, and any testing according to the test methods herein should be commenced immediately without storage of the aqueous treatment liquor. The resulting aqueous treatment liquor will generally contain a hydrophobic portion(s) (e.g. typically containing the components of the hydrophobic coating(s), such as benefit agent(s)), and an aqueous portion (e.g. typically containing the components of the porous dissolvable solid structure). The hydrophobic portion(s) and aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor can be isolated as follows. The aqueous treatment liquor is centrifuged at 4,500 g force for 30 minutes. Any layer(s) observed as separate from the main aqueous layer (i.e. the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor) after centrifugation is considered to be the hydrophobic portion(s) of the aqueous treatment liquor. Each layer is sampled individually and each sample is placed in a separate container. VISCOSITY TEST METHOD The viscosity of a component of the consumer product (e.g. hydrophobic coating), or a component of an aqueous treatment liquor formed as indicated above (e.g. hydrophobic portion or aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor), is determined as follows. For a given component, the viscosity reported is the viscosity value as measured by the following method, which generally represents the zero-shear viscosity (or zero-rate viscosity) of the component. Viscosity measurements are made with an AR2000 Controlled-Stress Rheometer (TA Instruments, New Castle, Delaware, U.S.A.), and accompanying software version 5.7.0. The instrument is outfitted with a 40 mm stainless steel parallel plate (TA Instruments catalog no. 511400.901) and Peltier plate (TA Instruments catalog no. 533230.901). The calibration is done in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. A refrigerated, circulating water bath set to 25 °C is attached to the Peltier plate. Measurements are made on the instrument with the following procedures: Conditioning Step (pre-condition the sample) under "Settings" label, initial temperature: 25 °C, pre-shear at 5.0 s"1 for 1 minute, equilibrate for 2 minutes; Flow-Step (measure viscosity) under "Test" Label, Test Type: "Steady State Flow", Ramp: "shear rate 1/s" from 0.001 s"1 and 1000 Mode: "Log", Points per Decade: 15, Temperate: 25 °C, Percentage Tolerance: 5, Consecutive with Tolerance: 3, Maximum Point Time: 45 sec, Gap set to 1000 micrometers, Stress-Sweep Step is not checked; Post-Experiment Step under "Settings" label; Set temperature: 25 °C. More than 1.25 ml of the test sample of the component to be measured is dispensed through a pipette on to the center of the Peltier plate. The 40 mm plate is slowly lowered to 1100 micrometers, and the excess sample is trimmed away from the edge of the plate with a rubber policeman trimming tool or equivalent. Lower the plate to 1000 micrometers (gap setting) prior to collecting the data. Discard any data points collected with an applied rotor torque of less than 1 micro-N m (e.g. discard data less than ten-fold the minimum torque specification). Create a plot of viscosity versus shear rate on a log-log scale. These plotted data points are analyzed in one of three ways to determine the viscosity value: first, if the plot indicates that the sample is Newtonian, in that all viscosity values fall on a plateau within +/- 20% of the viscosity value measured closest to 1 micro-N m, then the viscosity is determined by fitting the 'Newtonian' fit model in the software to all the remaining data; second, if the plot reveals a plateau in which the viscosity does not change by +/- 20% at low shear rates and a sharp, nearly-linear decrease in viscosity in excess of the +/- 20% at higher shear rates, then the viscosity is determined by applying the "Best Fit Using Viscosity vs. Rate" option from the "Analysis Toolbar"; third, if the plot indicates that the sample is only shear-thinning, in that there is only a sharp, nearly-linear decrease in viscosity, then the material is characterized by a viscosity which is taken as the largest viscosity in the plotted data, generally a viscosity measured close to 1 micro-N m of applied torque. Report the average value of the replicates as the viscosity of the component, in units of Pa s. THICKNESS OF HYDROPHOBIC COATING TEST METHOD The thickness of a hydrophobic coating(s) on a porous dissolvable solid structure of the consumer product is determined using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) equipped with Energy Dispersive X-ray Detection (EDS) for elemental analysis mapping. One such suitable instrument is the Hitachi S-4700 FE SEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope) (Hitachi High Technologies America Inc., Pleasanton, California, U.S.A.), equipped with Bruker SDD (Silicone Drift Detector) Esprit 1.9 for EDS mapping (Bruker Corp., Billerica, Massachusetts, U.S.A.). The consumer product is cut with a sharp razor blade and mounted such that the interior of the consumer product is observed in cross-sectional view (i.e., transverse view). Prior to imaging, the mounted sample of consumer product is covered with a thin conducting layer of gold and palladium via sputter deposition. The thickness of a hydrophobic coating of the consumer product is defined as the distance (in micrometers) between the outer-facing surface of the hydrophobic coating and the outer-facing surface of the porous dissolvable solid structure underneath the hydrophobic coating. Areas which appear to be uncoated are not to be measured, nor included in the average thickness value reported. The coating thickness is measured in at least 25 coated locations which are selected such that they are evenly distributed over the coated surface of the article. Report both the average thickness value and the maximum thickness value of the 25 thickness measurements made. If more than one surface of the porous dissolvable solid structure is coated, or if more than one type of coating is discernable, then an average and a maximum coating thickness is determined and reported separately for each surface or each coating type. PARTICLE SIZE TEST METHOD The particle size of particles (e.g. benefit agent particles) in an aqueous treatment liquor is determined as follows. Generate a well-mixed aqueous treatment liquor in accordance with the method above. The particle size of the well-mixed aqueous treatment liquor is conducted using brightfield light microscopy. One suitable light microscope is the Nikon Eclipse E600 POL microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, New York, U.S.A.) equipped with a brightfield condenser, and with 10X, 20X and 40X objective lenses, plus a digital camera such as the Evolution VF Monochrome Model# 01-Evolution VF-F-M-12, (Media Cybernetics, Rockville, Maryland, USA). Two drops of the well-mixed aqueous treatment liquor are mounted under a coverslip on a standard glass microscope slide, and observed microscopically. An objective lens is selected which provides images wherein the size of the mean particle diameter is approximately 5 - 10 % of the diameter of the field of view in the captured image. Representative images of the particles in the aqueous treatment liquor are captured by the digital camera until at least 100 representative particles have been photographed. Determine the radius of all representative particles in the captured images. For purposes of the particle size determination herein, the test method excludes air pockets/bubbles and solid particles such as encapsulated materials (e.g. perfume microcapsules), particle pigments, and the like. One skilled in the art can apply image analysis software (such as Image-Pro Premier 64- bit, Ver.9.0.4 Build5139, 64-bit Media Cybernetics, Rockville, Maryland, USA, or equivalent) to detect and/or measure the dimensions of particles (objects) on the field (background). For particles which appear as approximately circular (spherical) objects in the images, measure their diameter then calculate and record the particle radius. For particles which appear distinctly non- circular (non-spherical) objects, determine the cross-sectional area of each particle in the image via image analysis software. For each area measurement, calculate the equivalent radius (which is the radius possessed by a circle having the same area as the particle's area). Calculate the mean of all measured radii and all calculated equivalent radii, to produce a single mean radius value across all the particles photographed in the sample, and report this radius in micrometers as the particle size of the hydrophobic portion of the aqueous treatment liquor. INTERFACIAL TENSION TEST METHOD Interfacial tension (IFT) measurements are conducted between a hydrophobic portion of the aqueous treatment liquor and the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor using the pendant drop method. If it is impossible to create a drop in the pendant drop instrument (because the interfacial tension is too low), the measurements are then conducted by the spinning drop method. The aqueous treatment liquor is generated according to the method hereinbefore. The aqueous portion and hydrophobic portion(s) of the aqueous treatment liquor are isolated according to the centrifugation method hereinbefore. Using the pendant drop method, interfacial tension measurements are made by analyzing the shape of a pendant drop of a higher-density portion of the aqueous treatment liquor (e.g. typically a hydrophobic portion), suspended at the end of a capillary tube immersed in a lower- density portion of the aqueous treatment liquor (e.g. typically the aqueous portion). The pendant drop (hanging from a capillary tube) deforms under its own weight and an image of the drop is captured and analyzed. Comparison of the local curvature associated with the drop shape at different points along the curve provides a measure of the interfacial tension. A suitable instrument for these IFT includes the Kriiss Drop Shape Analysis System DSA100 (Kriiss, Hamburg, Germany). To conduct IFT measurements, it is necessary to first determine the density of the aqueous portion of the aqueous treatment liquor and the density of a hydrophobic portion of the aqueous treatment liquor. A suitable instrument for these density measurements is an Anton Paar DMA 4100 Density Meter (Anton Paar, Graz, Austria). Test sample of a given portion of the aqueous treatment liquor is loaded a 10-ml syringe and injected into the Density Meter. The injected sample is visually checked to ensure there are no air bubbles in the instrument prior to starting the measurement. The measured density of the sample is recorded from the instrument display panel. To conduct pendant drop IFT measurements, the lower-density portion of the aqueous treatment liquor is brought to 22°C inside the drop-shape analysis instrument reservoir. The higher-density portion of the aqueous treatment liquor is placed in instrument's capillary tube, and a small drop of the higher-density portion is extruded from the capillary tube into the reservoir. IFT measurements are obtained from images of the drop when its size is about 90% of its weight at detachment (as determined by the continuous addition of more fluid). An image is captured of the drop in silhouette. Three hundred points along the outline of the drop's silhouette are utilized by the instrument software as locations for data collection. At each point, the local pressure is determined from the local curvature. In comparing points at different heights, this pressure different is equated to the pressure difference associated with gravitational pressure (height differences). Comparison between two points provides one interfacial tension number; this is repeated over all three hundred points, resulting 150 measures of the interfacial tension. From this analysis the instrument reports a single mean value for the interfacial tension for a single drop. The process is repeated for a minimum of five drops. The average IFT value from the five or more replicates is reported, in units of N-m-1. If a hydrophobic portion of the aqueous treatment liquor fails to form a pendant droplet at the end of the instruments capillary tube, and instead forms a stream of fluid, then the interfacial tension measurements are conducted via the spinning drop method. One instrument suitable for these spinning drop IFT measurements is the Kriiss SITE04 Instrument (Kriiss, Hamburg, Germany). To conduct spinning drop IFT measurements (with hydrophobic portions which fail to form pendant droplets), a small drop of the lower-density portion of the aqueous treatment liquor is placed inside a barrel (or column) of the higher-density portion of the aqueous treatment liquor (or 'continuous phase'). The barrel is spun causing the drop to elongate along the axis of rotation. The resulting cross-sectional radius (normal to the axis of rotation) is linked to the interfacial tension as being proportional to the square of the rotation rate and the cube of the resulting radius. To make these measurements, the higher-density portion (continuous phase) is brought to 22°C in the barrel, and 3 μL· of the lower-density portion is introduced into the barrel. The barrel is rotated at between 1,000 - 10,000 RPM. A minimum of five rotation speeds are selected that deform the drop such that 0.9 > R/R0 > 0.75, where R is the short radius orthogonal to rotational axis at the rotational speed and R0 is the radius of the drop at rest. At each rotational speed, the spinning is held for 10 minutes to equilibrate, the radius is measured and the interfacial tension is calculated. The reported interfacial tension value is the average of all values calculated at the different rotational speeds, and is expressed in units of N- m_1. CAPILLARY NUMBER CALCULATION The Capillary Number is a dimensionless, calculated ratio which reflects the balance of viscous force to interfacial tension as related to the deformation and break up of drops in a sheared fluid. The Capillary Number (Ca) is expressed and calculated as: wherein: Ca is the Capillary Number (unitless), r is the Radius of Sheared Hydrophobic Portion Droplets (in meters), υ is the fixed Shear Rate of 100 (in s"1), γ is the Interfacial Tension between the Aqueous Portion of the Aqueous Treatment Liquor and Hydrophobic Portion of the Aqueous Treatment Liquor (in N- m-1 ), and μ is the Viscosity of the Aqueous Portion of the Aqueous Treatment Liquor (in Pa s). The test methods for determining Viscosity (μ) and Interfacial Tension (γ) are described hereinabove. The test method for determining the Radius of the Sheared Hydrophobic Portion Droplets (r) is described herein below. The Shear Rate (ύ) is a fixed constant as denoted above (100 s"1, which originates from the operating conditions of the Linkam CSS450 optical shear stage rheometer, as used to measure the Radius of Sheared Hydrophobic Portion Droplets). The Capillary Number is then calculated from the equation above. For purposes of calculating the Capillary Number, the Radius of Sheared Hydrophobic Portion Droplets ("r") is determined as follows. Prepare a Linkam CSS450 optical shear stage rheometer (Linkam Scientific Instruments Ltd., Tadworth, Surrey, U.K.) by aligning the shear stage on a brightfield light microscope, such as an Nikon Eclipse LV100 POL Microscope (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, New York, U.S.A.) outfitted with a digital camera and a 10X objective lens, in accordance with all manufacturer manuals. Adjust the gap to 1.0 mm. Load the sample materials into the optical rheometer in three layers, as follows. Add 0.75 ml of Aqueous Portion of the Aqueous Treatment Liquor to the base of a shear stage of the optical rheometer completely covering the base of the solution sample cell. Place one drop of a Hydrophobic Portion of the Aqueous Treatment Liquor on top of the Aqueous Portion, locating the Hydrophobic Portion droplet over the observation hole in the bottom of the solution cell (the observation hole is a distance of 7.5 mm outward from the rotational center of the stage). Add another 0.75 ml of Aqueous Portion of the Aqueous Treatment Liquor on top of these two layers. Replace the cover and tighten the screws. Shear the mixture at 100 s"1 for 10 minutes. Observe the resulting droplets through the microscope and capture representative images of the particles until at least 100 different particles have been photographed. Determine the radius of all representative particles in the captured images as follows. One skilled in the art can apply image analysis software (such as Image-Pro Premier 64- bit, Ver.9.0.4 Build5139, 64-bit Media Cybernetics, Rockville, Maryland, USA, or equivalent) to detect and/or measure the dimensions of particles (objects) on the field (background). For particles which appear as approximately circular (spherical) objects in the images, measure their diameter then calculate and record the particle radius. For particles which appear distinctly non- circular (non-spherical) objects, determine the cross-sectional area of each particle in the image via image analysis software. For each area measurement, calculate the equivalent radius of the particle (which is the radius possessed by a circle having the same area as the particle's area). Calculate the mean of all measured radii and calculated equivalent radii, to produce a single mean radius value across all the particles photographed in the sample. Report this radius in meters (m) as the Radius of Sheared Hydrophobic Portion Droplets, and use in the equation for calculating the Capillary Number above.

Distilled water and glycerin are weighed into the cooking container, which is then placed on the cooking apparatus. The blade is attached and set to stir the mixture at a speed setting of 30 (ca 48 rpm). The heating element is turned on and set for a target temperature of 75 °C, and the polyvinyl alcohol (Celvol 523) is added slowly to the stirred water/glycerin mixture. Once the water/glycerin/Celvol 523 mixture reaches 75 °C, mixing is continued an additional 10 minutes. Temperature is then set to 85°C, and the surfactants (Ammonium Cl l-AS, ALEIS, AE3S, and NaLAA) are added in order while stirring continued. After the addition of the surfactants, citric acid is added to reduce the pH to a range of 5.2 to 6.6. Once the mixture reaches 85°C, mixing is continued an additional 15 minutes, then the cooking container is removed from the cooking apparatus and set up to be stirred using an IKA RW20 ZM overhead mixer at a rate of 35 to 45 rpm until the mixture cooled to 45 °C. Stirring is then stopped and the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. At room temperature, water lost via evaporation during the making process is added to the mixture and stirred until homogeneous. The pH is measured to ensure it is between 5.2 and 6.6. A KitchenAid Mixer Model K5SS with flat beater and water bath attachments (available from Hobart Corporation, Troy, OH) is used to prepare the open-cell foam porous dissolvable solid structure. 300 grams of the premix is heated in an enclosed container in a 70°C oven for 2- 3 hours. About one liter of tap water is heated to 70°C to 75 °C, and the 5 quart stainless steel mixing bowl is preheated in the 70°C oven. The premix is transferred to the preheated mixing bowl, which is then attached to the mixer stand. The flat beater and water bath are attached to the mixer stand, and the water bath is filled with the heated water. The premix is vigorously aerated at the highest setting of 10 for about 60 seconds to a target wet foam density of between 0.25 to 0.27 g/mL. The resulting wet foam is then transferred aluminum molds (16 cm x 16 cm x 6.5 cm) using a rubber spatula. A 12" metal spatula is used to spread and level the wet foam in the mold to 6.5 mm. The filled molds are placed in a 130°C oven (Thermoscientific Precision Oven Model OV00F) with high air flow to dry for about 40 minutes. The molds are then removed from the oven and placed in a 70°F/50 RH room to cool and equilibrate. The resulting foam is then removed from molds and cut to desired size and shape to form the open-cell foam porous dissolvable solid structure. EXAMPLE 2 The following example relates to a porous dissolvable solid structure in the form of an open-cell foam. A 2 kilogram capacity Bottom Line Process Technologies Cooker (available from Bottom Line Process Technologies, Largo, Florida) with stir blade is used to prepare Example 2 premix. Distilled water and glycerin are weighed into the cooking container, which is then placed on the cooking apparatus. The blade is attached and set to stir the mixture at a speed setting of 30 (ca 48 rpm). The heating element is turned on and set for a target temperature of 75 °C, and the polyvinyl alcohol (Celvol 523) is added slowly to the stirred water/glycerin mixture. Once the water/glycerin/Celvol 523 mixture reaches 75°C, mixing is continued an additional 10 minutes. Temperature is then set to 85°C, and the surfactants (Ammonium Cl l-AS, ALE1S, and AE3S) are added in order while stirring continued. After the addition of the surfactants, citric acid is added to reduce the pH to a range of 5.2 to 6.6. Once the mixture reaches 85°C, mixing is continued an additional 15 minutes, then the cooking container is removed from the cooking apparatus and set up to be stirred using an IKA RW20 ZM overhead mixer at a rate of 35 to 45 rpm until the mixture cooled to 45 °C. Stirring is then stopped and the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. At room temperature, water lost via evaporation during the making process is added to the mixture and stirred until homogeneous. The pH is measured to ensure it is between 5.2 and 6.6. A KitchenAid Mixer Model K5SS with flat beater (available from Hobart Corporation, Troy, OH) is used to prepare the open-cell foam porous dissolvable solid structure. 250 grams of the premix is transferred to the 5 quart mixing bowl, which is then attached to the mixer stand. The flat beater is attached to the mixer stand. The premix is aerated at a setting of 6 for about 60 seconds to a target wet foam density of between 0.22 to 0.24 g/mL. The resulting wet foam is then transferred aluminum molds (16 cm x 16 cm x 6.5 cm) using a rubber spatula. A 12" metal spatula is used to spread and level the wet foam in the mold to 6.5 mm. The filled molds are placed in a 130°C oven (Thermoscientific Precision Oven Model OVOOF) with high air flow to dry for about 35 minutes. The molds are then removed from the oven and placed in a 70°F/50 RH room to cool and equilibrate. The resulting foam is then removed from molds and cut to desired size and shape to form the open-cell foam porous dissolvable solid structure.
