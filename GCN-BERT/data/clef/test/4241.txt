BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present application relates to a hepatic targeted drug delivery system, a process for preparing the same and a method for treating liver cancer. 2. Description of the Related Art Primary liver cancer is one of the most leading causes of death in China, which is only exceeded by gastric cancer and accounts for 45% of the total death caused by liver cancer all around the world. In addition, the five-year survival rate is merely 5%. At present, treatment for liver cancer mainly depends on organ transplantation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and the like. However, liver transplantation is limited by the shortage of donors and the potential immunologic rejection, while the radiotherapy always causes directly damage to bile duct. Therefore, the chemotherapy has become the mainstream for liver cancer treatment. However, the conventional chemotherapy is ineffective, mostly due to the disadvantages of short half-life time in blood stream, high overall clearance rate and poor selectivity for the desired site. In addition, liver has the ability to resist drugs. Low dosage of drugs is ineffective for liver cancer treatment while high dosage may cause toxicity for other organs. Therefore, the development of controlled release and hepatic targeted drug delivery system is primarily important. Recently, hepatic targeted drug delivery system has attracted much attention because it provides a high degree of selectivity to liver, enhances the uptake ability of drug-loaded nanoparticles into target sites, reduces drug doses and significantly decreases drug toxicity. However, the development of hepatic targeted drug delivery system is a bit slow. Some researchers have attempted to increase the tissue specificity of drug carriers by coupling with targeting agents, such as monoclonal antibodies. However, antibodies are costly and difficult to be obtained. In addition, as most of them come from mice, the bio-security becomes the major concerns. In recent years, the receptor-mediated hepatic targeted drug delivery system has attracted more attention because it is a promising way to transfer drug to the desired sites. Once a ligand is bound to a receptor, a ligand-receptor complex is rapidly internalized and the receptor recycles back to the surface (Ciechanover, A., Schwartz, A L. Lodish, H. F. Sorting and recycling of cell surface receptors and endocytosed ligands: the asialoglycoprotein and transferrin receptors. J. Cell. Biochem., 1983, 23(1-4), 107-130). Asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) is known as to be present on hepatocytes and several human hepatoma cell lines which shows a strongly affinity with galactose residues. Extensive studies have focused on the ASGPR-mediated hepatic targeted drug delivery system. For example, Hsing-Wen Sung, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 7,348,030 B 1 discloses nanoparticles for targeting hepatoma cells. In particular, nanoparticles comprised by poly(γ-glutamic acid)-block-polylactide and conjugated with galactosamine are disclosed. The in vitro experimental results show that these nanoparticles have high affinity to hepatoma cells. However, it has been reported that there are inhibitors in serum of a subject in pathologic status, which lead to low recognition of ASGPR for galactose residues (Stockert R. J., Morell A. G. Hepatic binding protein: the galactose-specific receptor of mammalian hepatocytes, Hepatology, 1983, 3: 750-757). Therefore, the development of a new hepatic targeted ligand instead of the conventional one is very necessary. Liquorice mainly distributes in the west of China and has been widely used in the prescription of traditional Chinese medicine. Glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid can be isolated from its root easily. In 1991, Negishi confirmed that the rat liver cell membrane contains a large number of binding sites for glycyrrhetinic acid and a small number of binding sites for glycyrrhizin (Negishi M., Irie A., Nagata N., et al. Specific binding of glycyrrhetinic acid to the rat liver membrane, Biochim. Biophys. Acta., 1991, 1066: 77-82). Since then, studies on the hepatic targeted drug delivery system mediated by glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acid has drawn the focus of most researchers. Subsequently, some Chinese and foreign researchers reported that when liposome or serum albumin was modified with glycyrrhizin/glycyrrhetinic acid, it exhibits a considerably high affinity to liver than that of the unmodified ones (Sayoko Osaka, Hideki Tsuji, Hiroshi Kiwada. Uptake of liposomes surface-modified with glycyrrhizin by primary cultures rat hepatocytes, Biol. Pham. Bull., 1994, 17: 940-943; Sheng-jun Mao, Shi-xiang Hou, Ru He, et al. Uptake of albumin nanoparticle surface modified with glycyrrhizin by primary cultured rat hepatocytes. World J. Gastroentenol., 2005, 11: 3075-3079). However, liposome is limited as a drug delivery carrier due to several factors such as the rapid uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES), quick clearance from blood stream and the leakage of their loading content before reaching the targeting sites. Therefore, some new drug carriers should be taken into consideration. During the last decade, biomedical polymers, especially the biodegradable and biocompatible polymers develop rapidly, promoting the development of drug controlled release field. Moreover, with the cross-integration of materials science, biomedicine and molecular biology, the developing process has also been accelerated. Polymeric nanoparticles can protect drugs from being uptaken by the RES, thereby enhancing drug stability, increasing the efficacy and prolonging the circulation time in blood, and the loaded drug can be targeted to the desired sites with a sustained release profile. Currently, much attention has been paid to the nanoparticles made from natural polysaccharide such as chitosan or its derivatives and sodium alginate. Moreover, synthetic poly(amino acid)-ester and polyester are also gained considerable attention. The hepatic targeted drug delivery system mediated by glycyrrhizin or glycyrrhetinic acid (components of traditional Chinese drug) is seldom reported in the world except in China. For example, Yingli ZHENG, et al. in Chinese patent application No. 200410052767.5 discloses glycyrrhizin-modified chitosan nanoparticles and process for preparing the same. Yiming LIU, et al. in Chinese patent application No. 200710062813.3 discloses a process for preparing glycyrrhetate-modified chitosan/carboxyl-chitosan complex nanoparticles. Up to now, the glycyrrhetinic acid-mediated hepatic targeted drug delivery system has solely been reported by Zhi YUAN, et al. in Chinese patent application No. 200510015172.7.

In one aspect of the present application, there is provided a nanoparticle of a hepatic targeted drug delivery system comprising a carrier and an anticancer agent, wherein the carrier is modified with glycyrrhetinic acid.

The behaviour, treatment and outlook of the two kinds of liver cancer are quite different from each other. The symptoms in the early stage of the primary liver cancer is quite vague and non-specific, like feeling generally unwell, sick (nausea), off food, weight loss and tiredness, sometime even associate with cirrhosis. As the cancer grows, more specific symptoms may also develop including abdominal pain over the liver area, jaundice and itch. Compared with the primary liver cancer, the symptoms of the second liver cancer is a bit mild, such as feeling tired, general hyperhidrosis.

The DOX concentration in supernatant was calculated by reversed phase HPLC on a C18 column (250 mm×4.6 mm). The mobile phase was a mixture of methanol/acetic acid (80:20, v/v). EE and LC were calculated based on the following equations: EE = weight ⁢ ⁢ of ⁢ ⁢ doxorubicin ⁢ ⁢ in ⁢ ⁢ the ⁢ ⁢ nanoparticles weight ⁢ ⁢ of ⁢ ⁢ the ⁢ ⁢ feeding ⁢ ⁢ doxorubicin × 100 ⁢ % ( 1 ) LC = weight ⁢ ⁢ of ⁢ ⁢ doxorubicin ⁢ ⁢ in ⁢ ⁢ the ⁢ ⁢ nanoparticles weight ⁢ ⁢ of ⁢ ⁢ the ⁢ ⁢ nanoparticles × 100 ⁢ % ( 2 ) EE and LC values of the doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles were 50.2% and 5.0%, respectively.

After incubation for four hours, the mixture was washed twice with RPMI 1640 and the fluorescence images were obtained by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The results were shown in FIG. 4, in which very little and weak fluorescences were observed in both 7703 cells and A549 cells after incubating with the nanoparticles without modified glycyrrhetinic acid during the same period. On the contrary, much stronger fluorescence was observed in 7703 cells incubated with the nanoparticles modified with glycyrrhetinic acid.

(2) Preparation of FITC-labeled Nanoparticles without Modification The process of unmodified nanoparticles is identical to that of the modified nanoparticles, except that mPEG-PLGA was used instead of GA-PEG-PLGA. In Vitro Cell Uptake of Nanoparticles Human hepatic carcinoma cells 7703 were seeded onto 48-well plates and maintained in 1640 media supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37° C. 200 μL of labeled nanoparticles suspension was added to the above plates. After incubation for two hours, the fluorescence images were obtained by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo. Japan). The results were shown in FIG. 13, in which very strong fluorescence was observed in 7703 cells after incubating with glycyrrhetinic acid modified nanoparticles, while weak fluorescence was observed after incubating with those without modification. These results indicated that the nanoparticles bearing glycyrrhetinic acid residues had a high affinity to 7703 cells. Discussion Naturally occurring polysaccharides, such as chitosan or derivatives thereof and an alginate, have been received wide attention in the fields of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals for their excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability and nontoxicity. In the present application, the process for preparing nanoparticles of hepatic targeted drug delivery system based on naturally occurring polysaccharides is very novel and simple. The process could be carried out by simple physical mixing and avoid using an organic solvent. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) was modified by diaminopolyethylene glycol to obtain GA-PEG without changing its targeting ability, while greatly enhancing its solubility, and it could easily entangle with naturally occurring polysaccharides. After adding an ion cross-linker, the mixture of GA-PEG and naturally occurring polysaccharides could form a spherical structure and the GA-PEG molecules could either exist in or locate on the surface of the sphere. The in vitro cell tests showed that the nanoparticles modified with glycyrrhetinic acid exhibited a strong affinity with liver cells than those without modification. Due to the considerable thermodynamic and kinetic stability, polymer micelles formed by synthetic polymers such as PEG-b-poly(amino acid) ester has gained considerable attention. Poly(amino acid) esters act as a hydrophobic segment because they can undergo hydrolytic and enzyme-catalyzed degradations and can be easily excreted from body. While the hydrophilic PEG can effectively prolong the circulation of nanoparticles in blood stream, adsorption by protein shall be prevented and uptake by reticuloendothelial system (RES) shall be lower. Moreover, when the PEG segment modified with targeting ligand in its chain end, it could achieve specific tissue targeting. After introducing diaminopolyethylene glycol to the carriers, the new system is more stable than that disclosed in Chinese patent application No. 200510015172.7 and can be stored up to more than two months without any aggregation or precipitation. In addition, after intravenous injection into the tail veins of rats, about 68% of the total nanoparticles modified with glycyrrhetinic acid accumulates in the livers of rats, which was far more than the unmodified ones. When loaded with anticancer drugs, the system exhibits a continuous release profile for 26 days with a cumulative release amount of about 80.93%. Polyesters are the most widely used biomaterials for their reasonably good biocompatibility and controllable biodegradability. More importantly, polylactides (PLA), polyglycolides (PGA) and a copolymer of lactide and glycolide (PLGA) have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and can be commercially available from various sources. In the present application, the hepatic targeted drug carriers were prepared by the condensation reaction between glycyrrhetinic acid and polyesters with diamine (such as ethylenediamine, 1,3-propanediamine, hexanediamine and the like) as space arms. The process is simple and can be easily reproduced. Furthermore, in vitro cell uptake tests show a strong interaction with liver cell via ligand-receptor recognition. The hepatic targeted drug delivery system of the present application can be easily prepared under mild conditions and can be administered intravenously. Moreover, the hepatic targeted drug delivery system of the present application can greatly enhance the efficacy and selectivity of anticancer drugs and may have a higher prospect for the treatment of liver cancer.
