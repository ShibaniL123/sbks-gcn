No. 61/591,818, filed Jan. 27, 2012, entitled “Alpine Split Board” and U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/681,069, filed Aug. 8, 2012, entitled “Alpine Split Board,” both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. BACKGROUND 1. Technical Field The present disclosure relates to snow-sport equipment and more specifically to a combination snowboard and downhill ski. 2. Introduction A wide variety of riding products exist for mountain snow sport enthusiasts. Downhill skiing has a long history of innovation and a great variety of ski designs have been developed over the years. Generally downhill skis are substantially flat axial planks with a binding used to couple with a ski boot. Each axial side of the individual skis has a sharpened metal edge that gives the skier the ability to turn and control his speed during downhill descent. Oftentimes the axial side of the individual skis have a parabolic sidecut, meaning the tip and tail of the ski are wider then the middle of the axial distance. The parabolic shape gives the skier more control over turning because the sidecut naturally encourages parabolic motion downhill as a skier applies pressure to the given edge. Like downhill ski technology, there are many solutions for cross-country skiing and backcountry/alpine trekking One common design feature for cross-country skiing and backcountry/alpine trekking skis include a binding that holds the toe of the boot securely in place while allowing the heel of the boot to rise and fall in a rhythmic motion. The rhythmic motion facilitates gliding as opposed to a marching motion that is used when snowshoeing. More recently, snowboarding has enjoyed huge popularity and snowboard design has progressed steadily. Like downhill skis, snowboards are typically designed with substantially parabolic edges to facilitate turning. For functional and safety reasons, snowboards also typically employ bindings that semi-permanently hold the snowboarders boot to the board, forcing the rider to strap in and strap out of the bindings one or two feet when a rider wants to traverse flat or upward portions of the mountain or trail. Likewise, unstrapping one foot from a snowboard and “skating” eliminates the advantage of having a large surface area under a rider's feet, causing the rider's feet to sink into the snow and requiring more effort. In addition to skis and snowboards for use in specific skiing/riding styles, splitboards, which allow use of a single device for more than one ski/ride style, have gained a somewhat recent popularity. A splitboard is a reconfigurable snowboard/alpine-trekking ski combination designed with various clasps and multi-purpose binding configurations to allow a user to physically split a snowboard down its length into two skis, reconfigure the bindings, and use the skis for cross country skiing or backcountry trekking However, splitboards do not have inside edges suitable for downhill skiing. Due to the lack of edges and a function-limiting straight inside edge, splitboard skis are unusable for downhill skiing. SUMMARY Additional features and advantages of the disclosure will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or can be learned by practice of the herein disclosed principles. The features and advantages of the disclosure can be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

As shown in FIG. 3A, a set of bindings 330, 340 are coupled with the gliding boards 311, 312 via ski binding plate systems 321, 322. Additionally, the combination snowboard/skis include two snowboard binding plate systems 351, 352. The snowboard binding plate systems 351, 352 are each configured with a sub-plate positioned substantially across from another sub-plate on each gliding board 311, 312. As shown, the snowboard binding plate system 351 comprises sub-plates 351a and 351b; likewise, the snowboard binding plate system 352 comprises sub-plates 352a and 352b. In some embodiments of the present technology, the position of the sub-plates 351a, 351b, 352a, and 352b are reconfigurable to allow individual riders to customize their binding positions. For example, in some embodiments, a series of drill hole (not shown) are drilled into the gliding boards 311, 312 and the sub-plates 351a, 351b, 352a, 352b coupled with the gliding boards 311, 312 via the drill holes in a plurality of combinations and arrangements. In some other embodiments, the sub-plates 351a, 351b, 352a, 352b are in a substantially fixed position and the rider tailors the riding position using a puck system in the sub-plates 351a, 351b, 352a, 352b or in the bindings themselves. The individual gliding boards 311, 312 each include two sharpened metal edges 311a and 311b, 312a and 312b, respectively. In some embodiments, all of the edges 311a, 311b, 312a, 312b comprise a substantially parabolic shape. FIG. 3B illustrates isometric top and side views of the combination snowboard/skis from FIG. 3A in a snowboard configuration according to some embodiments of the present technology. In the ski configuration, the set of bindings 330, 340 were coupled with the gliding boards 311, 312 via ski binding plate systems 321, 322. According to FIG. 3B, the set of bindings 330, 340 are coupled with the gliding boards via the plate systems 351, 352. In the snowboard configuration, edges 311a and 312a comprise the snowboard's outer edge configured to facilitate turning the snowboard. Also, the edges 311b and 312b form a small channel 360. The gliding boards 311, 312 are coupled in the snowboard configuration with clips 316, 317, 316′, and 317′. In some embodiments of the present technology, the tips and tails of the gliding boards 311, 312 are also coupled with each other with a jacket, clip, etc. As shown in FIG. 3, the tips and tails of the gliding boards 311, 312 are coupled via structural, semi-circular jackets 375, 377. The jackets 375, 377 fit over the tip 399 and the tail zone 397 of the gliding boards 311, 312 as well as forming tips and tails with a full semi-circular shape typically associated with snowboards. In some embodiments, the jackets 375, 377 are configured to be partially separated from the tips and tails of the gliding boards 311, 312 and to be folded over and clipped to one or both of the gliding boards 311, 312. In some other embodiments, the jackets 375, 377 are configured to be completely separated from the tips and tails of the gliding boards 311, 312. FIG. 4A illustrates a method 400 of converting combination snowboard/skis from a snowboard configuration to a ski configuration according to some embodiments of the present technology. The method 400 begins with removing the bindings from the snowboard binding plate systems 402, decoupling the tip connector and tail connector 404, and decoupling the ski connection clip pairings 406. In cases using a structural semi-circular jacket, the method 400 involves removing and storing the jacket 408. Next, the method 400 involves positioning the skis in a proper downhill configuration 410. For example, some embodiments involve swapping the position of the gliding boards relative to the axial length of the boards such that the curved portion of the tips and tails are positioned on the inside edge of the skier's stance, see FIG. 1B. Next, the method 400 involves attaching the bindings to ski binding plate systems 412. FIG. 4B illustrates a method 450 of converting combination snowboard/skis from a ski configuration to a snowboarding configuration according to some embodiments of the present technology. The method 450 begins with removing the bindings from the ski binding plate systems 452 and positioning the gliding boards into a snowboard configuration position 454. In cases using a structural and semi-circular jacket, the method 450 involves positioning the jacket 456 over the tips and tails of the gliding boards. Next, the method involves coupling the tip connector and tail connector 458, and coupling the ski connection clip pairings 460. Finally, the method 450 involves attaching the bindings to ski binding plate systems 462. As explained above, some embodiments of the present technology involve binding plate systems that are reconfigurable and are configured such that the binding system separates in the event of a threshold level of torque being applied, thereby causing the skier's/rider's feet to come free from the board(s) in dangerous circumstances. FIG. 5 illustrates two isometric views of a plate binding system 500 according to some embodiments of the present technology. The plate binding system 500 comprises a top plate 510 with a disk (not shown) extending from its bottom surface and bottom plate 520 having a disk-receiving aperture 525. The top plate 510 is configured to slide into the slider tracks 210 of the bindings 200 shown in FIG. 2 above, thereby coupling the binding 200 to the plate system 500. The bottom plate 520 comprises drill holes 515 for attaching the plate binding system 500 to the gliding boards. The disk (not shown) extending from the bottom surface of the top plate 510 is releasably coupled inside the aperture 525 of the bottom plate 520 via a plurality of pins 353. The bottom plate 520 also includes a release-setting gauge 530 that displays a setting for the currently selected torque threshold required to separate the disk from the aperture 525. The bottom plate 520 also includes a set screw (shown in FIG. 6 below) for adjusting the sensitivity of the release settings. FIG. 6 illustrates an exploded view of a bottom plate 600 of a plate binding system according to some embodiments of the present technology. As shown, the bottom plate 600 comprises a torque-sensitive release mechanism 620 housed within a cavity created by space between cover 610 and cover 630. The torque-sensitive release mechanism 620 is sealed in the cavity via a plurality of pins 660 and screws 670. Also housed in the cavity are a settings piston 650 and a piston guide 680. The settings piston 650 is coupled with and a set screw 640 that is manipulated from outside the cavity. Also, the settings piston 650 is configured to adjust the torque sensitivity settings for the torque-sensitive mechanism 620 upon rotation of the set screw 640. FIGS. 7-10 illustrate additional views of an exemplary reconfigurable binding. The binding 700 shown in FIG. 7-10 is substantially similar to the binding shown in FIG. 2, however, the binding shown in FIGS. 7-10 includes additional features for using the binding with a conventional snowboard or a conventional ski. Binding 700 is configured to receive a conventional snowboard rider style boot. A heel member 710 is designed to accept the rear portion of the rider boot. The rear portion of the rider boot can be placed over cavity formed by the heel member 710, lockable shin wing 708, and the reconfigurable binding base 702. The heel member 710 is connected to the lockable shin wing 708 on one side and the binding base 702 on the other side. In some embodiments, the heel member 710 is moveable as the rider's heel moves in the alpine touring mode. The heel member 710 can slide upwards and downwards as the rider climbs up the uphill to facilitate walking The feet strap 712 enables a rider boot to enter and exit the reconfigurable binding conveniently. In one embodiment, the feet strap 712 is hinged on one side of the reconfigurable binding and has a latch and hook on the other side of the reconfigurable binding. The latch and the hook enable the rider to tighten or shorten the length of the feet strap 712 to hold the rider boot securely. In other embodiment, the feet strap 712 includes a strap buckle which can be conveniently utilized to tighten the feet strap. The reconfigurable binding 700 includes a binding base 702 mounted on the gliding board. The binding base includes opening 720 which is configured to receive a cotter pin that secures the reconfigurable binding 700 to the ski binding plate system 121, 122 in alpine touring ski mode. The binding base also includes opening 722, which is configured to receive a cotter pin that secures the reconfigurable binding 700 to two snowboard binding plate systems 151, 152. The reconfigurable binding 700 includes side rails 704 underneath the reconfigurable binding 700. The side rails 704 are configured to slide into a plate rail on the gliding board, thereby coupling the reconfigurable binding 700 to the gliding board. The reconfigurable binding 700 includes alpine touring connections 706A 706B. The alpine touring connection 706A is positioned in the front of the feet and includes opening 720. The alpine touring connection 706B is positioned in the heel area and engages onto the heel of the rider boot. The alpine touring connection 706B can comprise a series of pins and springs to engage with the movement of the heel of the rider. In alpine touring configuration, when the rider climbs or walks up the mountain, the pins can move along with the rider to disengage the heel of the rider from the binding base 702 for a great degree of freedom. The reconfigurable binding includes opening 722 for holding the reconfigurable binding in place when the rider is using the reconfigurable binding as a split board. In this configuration a rider will place their boot into the reconfigurable binding. The binding is secured to two snowboard binding plate systems 151, 152 via side rails 704, and a pin that is received within opening 722. The pin also serves to secure the heel of the binding into a fixed position. Reconfigurable binding is also configured to engage with a traditional alpine ski binding for times when a user doesn't want to use the alpine split board, but instead would like to use traditional alpine skies. In such instances it can be inconvenient to have to change from snowboarding boots into alpine ski boots. The reconfigurable binding 700 removes this impediment by functioning as an alpine ski boot itself. The alpine touring connection 706A has a front edge having a protruding shape to be received by a toe portion of a conventional alpine ski binding. The alpine touring connection 706A can be shaped as a toe-shaped to match a shape of the front portion of the ski boot. The rear portion of the alpine touring connection 706B is shaped to be configured to be received by a heel portion of a conventional alpine ski binding. In some embodiments, the height 705 for the front part of the alpine touring connection 706A is shorter than the height 707 of the rear part of the alpine touring connection 706B. This dimension is to be compatible with the traditional alpine ski boots. The reconfigurable binding 700 can be further configured with a lockable shin wing 708 for “side to side” control in ski mode. The lockable shin wing 708 has a high back that wraps around the shin, thus the skier can have more lateral movement when making turns. The lockable shin wing 708 can fold down for convenience and can lock in a rigid upright configuration. When the skier makes left or right turns, the skier can lean on the lockable shin wing 708 as the entire lockable shin wing 708 will lean with the skier. The lockable shin wing 708 can give more coverage and leverage around shin. A shin strap slot 714 can be coupled with the lockable shin wing 714 to give more support to the skier. The shin strap can come out of the shin strap slot 714 to have the lockable shin wing to be tightly fixed to the skier's shin. The shin strap can be positioned on a calf position to hold a skier's boot in a high-ankle rigid ski stance. The shin strap can be any elastic or stretchable band. The shin strap may be adhered to the other side of the shin strap by any velcroed material or clip. When the shin strap is not in use, the shin strap can remain in the inside of the lockable shin wing 714. FIG. 10 shows a top view of reconfigurable binding 700. As part of binding base 702, a series of holes 718 are formed which provide a universal attachment mechanism for interfacing with a traditional snowboard binding. In some embodiments, binding base 702 forms a single opening for receiving an offset multi-disk 716 that provides the universal attachment mechanism for interfacing with one of a plurality of common snowboard bindings. As described herein, the reconfigurable binding can be used with the alpine split board described herein when the alpine split board is in both split board mode (i.e., snow board configuration and ski mode). The reconfigurable binding is further adapted to be able to be received within a conventional downhill ski binding, wherein the reconfigurable binding functions as part of the rider's boot. Finally, the reconfigurable binding can further be used a binding for a traditional snowboard and alpine touring.
