CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/578,982 filed on Dec. 22, 2011. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to the reforming process, and more particularly to a low pressure process and catalyst formulation for converting the C11+ portion of the reformate into useful benzene, toluene, and xylene components or their single ring aromatic C9 to C10 precursors. Processes and apparatus for the catalytic reforming process are disclosed, for instance, in Robert A. Meyers, Handbook of Petroleum Refining Processes, Third Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2003, Part 4. Light petroleum distillate (naphtha) is contacted with a catalyst at elevated temperature and pressure to produce a high-octane liquid product that is rich in aromatic compounds. Reforming technology employs multiple reactors that typically contain a single type of catalyst which has mainly a dehydrogenation component and an acid component. The C10 polycyclic and C11+ aromatic production from a given naphtha is almost complete in the first reactor. If these species continue downstream, they cause coke formation and deactivate the catalysts in the downstream reactors. The C11+ component of the reformate is not considered a useful feedstock for the production of benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX). U.S. Pat. No. 5,763,720 discusses a transalkylation process to convert a heavy aromatic feed into lighter aromatics products, such as benzene, toluene, and xylene, by contacting a C9+ aromatics fraction and benzene and/or toluene over a catalyst comprising a zeolite, such as ZSM-12, and a hydrogenation component. U.S. Pat. No. 5,763,721 teaches a process for hydrodealkylating a C9+ aromatic compound to a C6 to C8 aromatic hydrocarbon. U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,651 describes a transalkylation process for converting a heavy aromatics feed to lighter aromatic products, such as benzene and xylene, by reacting C9+ aromatic hydrocarbons and toluene and benzene under transalkylation reaction conditions over first and second catalyst compositions. EP 0 138 617 B2 discusses a hydrodealkylation and isomerization process to convert alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds using a catalyst formed from a zeolite. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention discloses a process and catalyst formulation for converting C11+ components to benzene, toluene, and xylene or their single ring aromatic C9 to C10 precursors. One aspect of the invention is a reforming process. In one embodiment, the process includes reacting a naphtha feed stream in a first reforming zone under reforming conditions to produce a first reforming zone product stream; and reacting the first reforming zone product stream in an endpoint reduction zone under endpoint reduction conditions to produce a product stream having a reduced endpoint compared to an endpoint of the first reforming zone product stream. Another aspect of the invention is an endpoint reduction catalyst. In one embodiment, the catalyst includes: 0 to about 75% by weight of catalyst of a binder; about 1 to about 20% by weight of catalyst of molybdenum modified with sulfur; about 5 to about 70% by weight of catalyst of a zeolite having a 10 member ring or less; and 0 to about 60% by weight of catalyst of a zeolite having a 12 member ring by weight of catalyst.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It would be beneficial to convert the C11+ portion of the reformate into useful BTX components or their single ring aromatic C9 to C10 precursors in a reformer. The goal of the present invention is to reduce the endpoint of the reforming zone product by dealkylating single ring components in the reformate, and saturating and cracking polynuclear aromatic (PNA) components. Reducing the amount of these heavy components in the reformate reduces or prevents coke formation in the downstream reactors. The conversion of the long chains and PNA compounds reduces the endpoint of the product stream of the endpoint reduction and dealkylation (EPR/DEA) section of the reformer. The present invention involves a reforming process with an EPR/DEA zone. The EPR/DEA section operates at low pressure to convert the C11+ components by selective hydrogenation and hydrodealkylization to lower boiling point aromatics such as BTX components or their C9 to C10 precursors. This results in a product which has a lower endpoint than the endpoint of the stream entering the EPR/DEA zone. For example, the endpoint, defined as the 99.5% level in a simulated distillation test, such as ASTM D-2887, can be reduced at least about 20° C., or at least about 25° C., or at least about 30° C., or at least about 35° C., or at least about 40° C. The recovery of methyl groups and aromatic rings in the EPR/DEA zone is at least about 95%, or at least about 98%, or at least about 99%. The EPR/DEA zone can allow one or more of the following conversions. The C11+ aromatic conversion across the EPR/DEA zone is at least about 25%. The EPR/DEA zone very effectively dealkylates ethyl, propyl, and higher carbon number alkyl groups that are typically present in the C8+ range aromatics. The EPR/DEA zone provides an ethyl group dealkylation function in the C9 aromatic range that is characterized by converting at least about 80% of the methylethylbenzene, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%. At least about 80% of methylpropyl benzene, diethyl benzene, and butyl benzene is dealkylated in the EPR/DEA zone. At least about 50% of the dimethylethylbenzene is dealkylated in the EPR/DEA zone. The conversion of C5-C12+ alkylated benzenes excluding pentamethyl benzenes, C5 to C10+ alkylated naphthalenes, C4 to C5+ alkylated phenantrenes, and C4 to C5+ alkylated anthracenes in the EPR/DEA zone is at least about 35%, or at least about 40%. The conversion of naphthalene is at least about 10%. Less than about 2% of the C6-C8 non-aromatic range are converted in the EPR/DEA zone. Furthermore, only a low level of transalkylation occurs in the EPR/DEA zone, for example, less than 35% conversion of trimethylbenzene (TMB) for a feed of 25% benzene and 75% C9+ aromatics, as shown in FIG. 1. In addition, FIG. 2 shows low xylene yield at low pressure for the same composition. The xylene yields are much higher at 1034 KPa (150 psig) compared to 345 KPa (50 psig), consistent with the transalkylation reaction occurring better at higher pressures than low pressure. FIG. 3 illustrates one embodiment of a reforming process including an EPR/DEA zone. A naphtha stream 10 enters reforming zone 15. Reforming zone 15 operates under typical reforming conditions in the presence of a typical reforming catalyst and produces a reforming zone product stream 20. Reforming zones can further include more than one reactor vessel that contains typical reforming catalyst. These reactors can further be connected with and without additional separation equipment. The reforming zone 15 hence can generate at least one outlet stream. The reforming zone product stream 20 is sent to a separation zone 25 where one or more streams are generated. In this embodiment, separation zone 25 produces a first outlet stream 30, a second outlet stream 35, and a third outlet stream 40. Stream 30 contains hydrogen and C6− hydrocarbons. Stream 35 is rich in C7-C8 aromatics, but also contains C7-C8 non-aromatics. Stream 40 is rich in C9+ aromatics. Stream 30 can optionally be mixed with additional benzene and/or toluene 45 and is sent to the EPR/DEA zone 50. Stream 40 is also sent to the EPR/DEA zone 50. Dealkylation and cracking/saturation take place in the EPR/DEA zone 50 producing a first outlet stream 55. The first outlet stream 55 of the EPR/DEA zone 50 is mixed with the C7-C8 side stream 35 from the separation zone 25 and sent to the second reforming zone 60, where a second reforming reaction occurs. The first outlet stream 65 from the reforming zone 60 can then be recovered. In another embodiment, the separation zone 25 produces at least three outlet streams. The first outlet stream is rich in hydrogen. The second outlet stream is rich in C6-C7 hydrocarbons, and the third outlet stream is rich in C8+ aromatics. The third outlet stream and the first hydrogen rich stream are sent to the EPR/DEA zone 50. The second outlet stream can be sent to the second reforming zone. Another embodiment of the reforming process including an EPR/DEA zone is illustrated in FIG. 4. In this embodiment, the naphtha feed 110 is introduced into a separation zone 115 where at least two outlet streams are generated. The first outlet stream 120 is rich in C8−. The second outlet stream 125 is rich in C9+. The C9+ stream 125 is sent to a reforming reactor 130 where it is reacted to form a C9+ aromatics rich stream 135. The C9+ aromatics rich stream 135 is then sent to the EPR/DEA zone 140 where the C9+ aromatics are converted to a C8− aromatics stream 145. Optionally, a hydrogen rich stream can also be introduced to the inlet of the EPR/DEA zone 140. The C8− stream 120 from the separation zone 115 is sent to a second reforming zone 150. All (or a portion) of the C8− aromatics stream 145 from the EPR/DEA zone 140 can be combined with the C8− overhead stream 120 and sent to the second reforming zone 150. The second reformate zone 150 can generate multiple outlet streams. The first outlet stream 155 would be rich in aromatics and several product streams from it can then be recovered, including hydrogen and C5− product. Alternatively, all (or a portion) of the C8− aromatics stream 145 can be recovered instead of being sent to the second reforming zone 150. FIG. 5 illustrates another embodiment of the reforming process including an EPR/DEA zone. In this case, the naphtha feed 210 enters the reforming zone 215. At least one product stream 220 from the reforming zone 215 is sent to the EPR/DEA zone 225 along with an optional benzene and/or toluene stream 230. At least one product stream 235 from the EPR/DEA zone 225 is then sent to a second reforming zone 240. At least one product stream 245 from the second reforming zone 240 can then be recovered. FIG. 6 illustrates one embodiment of a reforming process in combination with a portion of a process to produce aromatics including an EPR/DEA zone. Many aromatics processes are known. A naphtha stream 310 enters reforming zone 315. Reforming zone 315 operates under typical reforming conditions in the presence of a typical reforming catalyst and produces a reforming zone product stream 320. Reforming zones can further include more than one reactor vessel that contains typical reforming catalyst. These reactors can further be connected with and without additional separation equipment. The reforming zone 315 hence can generate at least one outlet stream. The reforming zone product stream 320 is sent to a separation zone 325 where one or more streams are generated. In this embodiment, separation zone 325 produces a first outlet stream 330, a second outlet stream 335, and a third outlet stream 340. In a first embodiment one outlet stream may contain C8+ hydrocarbons which may be rich in aromatics, in a second embodiment one outlet stream may contain C7+ hydrocarbons which may be rich in aromatics, and in a third embodiment one outlet stream may contain C9+ hydrocarbons which may be rich in aromatics. In this embodiment, separation zone 325 may contain, for example, a debutanizer followed by a naphtha splitter column and therefore stream 335 may be overhead from the debutanizer and contains C4 and lighter hydrocarbons and gases, 330 may be rich in C6− hydrocarbons, and stream 340 may be rich in C7+ hydrocarbons. Alternatively, the naphtha splitter column of separation zone 325 may be operated so that outlet stream 340 may be rich in C8+ hydrocarbons, or may be rich in C9+ hydrocarbons. Stream 330 can optionally directed to a unit in a process for producing aromatics such as extraction unit 375 to produce stream 380 rich in benzene. Stream 340 may be sent to the EPR/DEA zone 350. Dealkylation and cracking/saturation take place in the EPR/DEA zone 350 producing a first outlet stream 355. The first outlet stream 355 of the EPR/DEA zone 350 may be sent to the second separation zone 360, where at least two separated stream are generated, stream 370 and stream 365. In another embodiment at least a portion of one outlet stream, stream 350, from the EPR/DEA zone 350 is introduced into the separation zone 325, preferably before the debutanizer in zone 325. The separated streams 370 and or 365 may be recovered or may be further processed. In one embodiment, stream 370 is rich in toluene and stream 365 is rich in C8+ hydrocarbons. FIG. 7 illustrates one embodiment of a reforming process in combination with a portion of a process to produce aromatics including an EPR/DEA zone. Many aromatics processes are known. A naphtha stream 410 enters reforming zone 415. Reforming zone 415 operates under typical reforming conditions in the presence of a typical reforming catalyst and produces a reforming zone product stream 420. Reforming zones can further include more than one reactor vessel that contains typical reforming catalyst. These reactors can further be connected with and without additional separation equipment. The reforming zone 415 hence can generate at least one outlet stream. The reforming zone product stream 420 is sent to the EPR/DEA zone 425. Dealkylation and cracking/saturation take place in the EPR/DEA zone 425 producing a first outlet stream 435. The first outlet stream 435 of the EPR/DEA zone 425 may be sent to separation zone 440 where one or more streams are generated. In this embodiment, separation zone 440 produces a first outlet stream 445, a second outlet stream 450, and a third outlet stream 455. In a first embodiment one outlet stream may contain C8+ hydrocarbons which may be rich in aromatics, in a second embodiment one outlet stream may contain C7+ hydrocarbons which may be rich in aromatics, and in a third embodiment one outlet stream may contain C9+ hydrocarbons which may be rich in aromatics. In this embodiment, separation zone 440 may contain, for example, a debutanizer followed by a naphtha splitter column and therefore stream 455 may be overhead from the debutanizer and contains C4 and lighter hydrocarbons and gases, 450 may be rich in C6− hydrocarbons, and stream 445 may be rich in C7+ hydrocarbons. Alternatively, the naphtha splitter column of separation zone 440 may be operated so that outlet stream 340 may be rich in C8+ hydrocarbons, or may be rich in C9+ hydrocarbons. Stream 450 may optionally directed to a unit in a process for producing aromatics such as, for example, an extraction unit to produce a stream rich in benzene (not shown). Stream 445 may optionally be directed to another separation zone for separation of specific aromatics and further processing. For example, xylenes may be separated from other aromatics and each of the separated streams may be further processed. Because reforming reactions do not take place efficiently at high pressure, reforming zones typically operate at pressures less than about 689 KPa (100 psig). Thus, it is desirable that any zones which are located in the reforming section also operate at pressures less than about 689 KPa (100 psig). It has been found that the EPR/DEA reactions take place at this pressure. The pressure in the EPR-DEA zone is generally less than about 689 KPa (100 psig), typically about 345 KPa (50 psig). As discussed above, FIG. 1 shows lower conversion of trimethylbenzene at 345 KPa (50 psig) than at 1034 KPa (150 psig), and FIG. 2 shows lower xylene yield. In the present invention, it is unnecessary for transalkylation to take place at this point in the system because there are downstream zones in which the transalkylation reactions desirably occur. The EPR/DEA zone typically operates at a temperature in the range of about 250° C. (482° F.) to about 550° C. (1022° F.). The ratio of H2 to HC is generally in the range of about 0.1 to about 8, typically about 2.0 to about 6.0. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is generally in the range of about 0.1 to about 10 hr−1, typically about 0.5 to about 4 hr−1. The catalyst includes at least one hydrogenation component and at least one alumino-silicate based acid component. It functions at low pressure and is capable of converting C9+ aromatics, particularly C11+ aromatics to useful benzene, toluene, and xylene components or their single ring aromatic C9-C10 precursors via selective hydrogenation and dehydroalkylation. The catalyst for the EPR/DEA zone typically includes a suitable inorganic oxide component (refractory binder or matrix) to facilitate fabrication of the catalyst, provide strength and reduce fabrication costs. Suitable binders include, but are not limited to, inorganic oxides such as one or more of silica, alumina, magnesia, zirconia, chromia, titania, boria, thoria, aluminum phosphate, zinc oxide, and mixtures thereof.
