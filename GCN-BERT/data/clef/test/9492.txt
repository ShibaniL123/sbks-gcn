EXAMPLE 2
5-(2-fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (reaction scheme 2, compound 2)
2.1: 1-benzhydryl-5-bromo-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione
6.4 mL (26.2 mmol) of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide is added to a solution of 2 g (10.5 mmol) of 5-bromo-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione in 40 ml of acetonitrile. The reaction mixture is stirred until a clear solution is obtained, then 3.9 g (15.8 mmol) of benzhydryl bromide and 267 mg (1.1 mmol) of iodine are added. The reaction mixture is heated under reflux for 5 hours and then left at room temperature for 18 hours. The solvents are concentrated under vacuum and then the residue is taken up in 50 ml of ethyl acetate and 50 ml of water. The organic phase is washed once with water and then with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product is chromatographed on silica gel eluted with a heptane/ethyl acetate mixture, 70/30 and then 50/50. 2.5 g (67%) of 1-benzhydryl-5-bromo-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a yellow solid.
