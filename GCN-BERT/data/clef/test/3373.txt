Preparation Example 3-3 : Preparation of methyl 6-bromo-3-methoxypicolinate (LXVII)
Methyl 6-bromo-3-hydroxypicolinate (5.07 g, 21.85 mmol) was dissolved in acetone (75 mL). To the resulting solution were added dropwise potassium carbonate (K2CO3) (4.83 g, 34.96 mmol) and iodomethane (CH3I) (1.77 mL, 28.41 mmol) and the solution was refluxed with heat for 3 hrs. The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate, diluted with EtOAc, and washed with water. The washed organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane/ethylacetate = 3/1) to give the white title compound (4.18 g, 78 %).
