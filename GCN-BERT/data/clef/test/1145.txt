(S)-4-[4-cyano-2-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-3,6-dimethyl-2-oxo-1-[3-(trifluormethyl)phenyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carbamide (XIX)
(S)-4-[4-cyano-2-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-3,6-dimethyl-2-oxo-1-[3-(trifluormethyl)phenyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid (XXVII) (390.5 g, 0.791 mol) was dissolved in THF (3.9 l). To remove residual traces of water, 21 of THF was distilled off at 80° C. bath temperature. This was combined with 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole (192.5 g, 1.187 mol) at 0° C. and stirred for 1 h at 20° C. and for 2 h at 50° C. After this, a 26% ammonia solution (518 g, 7.91 mol) was apportioned at 25° C. and stirring was done for 16 h. The reaction mixture was heated to 50° C. for 2 h, and excess ammonia was gassed out. After cooling, the reaction mixture was slowly added to 7.8 l of water and the resulting crystallizate was stirred overnight. The product was filtered off and washed with water (2.4 l). Drying was done at 40° C. in vacuum. Yield: 361 g (92% of theory) of a cream-colored solid.
