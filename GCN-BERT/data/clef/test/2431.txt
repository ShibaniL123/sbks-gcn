Preparation of (R)-3-(2-(((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline
Borane tetrahydrofuran complex in THF (1 M; 35.2 ml, 35.2 mmol) was added to a solution of (R)-N-(1-(3-amino-2-methylphenyl)propan-2-yl)-1-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxamide (1.47 g, 5.87 mmol) in THF (13.7 mL) at room temperature under nitrogen. The reaction was then heated at 65° C. for 6 hrs. The reaction was cooled to 0° C. and quenched cautiously with MeOH (gas evolution). The solution was then concentrated under reduced pressure and stored in the freezer for 18 hours. The residue was dissolved in MeOH (6 mL) and heated at 65° C. for 3 hrs. The solution was cooled to room temperature and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue obtained was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 16% methanol in DCM, to afford (R)-3-(2-(((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (1.14 g, 82%) as colorless oil.
