4-{(S)-2-(4-EthyIthiazol-2-yl)-2-[2-(3-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-3-phenylpropanamido]ethyl}phenylsulfamic acid (31)
Preparation of ethyl-2-benzyl-3-[(S)-1-(4-ethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-ethylamino]-3-oxopropanoate (29): To a solution of 1-(S)-(4-ethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethyl amine hydrobromide, 3, (0.406 g, 1.13 mmol), 2-benzyl-3-ethoxy-3-oxopropanoic acid (0.277 g) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) (0.191 g, 1.41 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) at 0°, is added 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDCI) (0.240 g, 1.25 mmol) followed by diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) (0.306 g). The mixture is stirred at 0 °C for 30 minutes then at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture is diluted with water and extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic phase is washed with 1 N aqueous HCl, 5 % aqueous NaHCO3, water and brine, and dried over Na2SO4. The solvent is removed in vacuo to afford 0.169 g (31 % yield) of the desired product which is used without further purification.
