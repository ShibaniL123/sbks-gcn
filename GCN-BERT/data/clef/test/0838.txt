TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure generally relates to medical devices for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, and more particularly to a surgical system for correction of a spine disorder. BACKGROUND Spinal pathologies and disorders such as scoliosis and other curvature abnormalities, kyphosis, degenerative disc disease, disc herniation, osteoporosis, spondylolisthesis, stenosis, tumor, and fracture may result from factors including trauma, disease and degenerative conditions caused by injury and aging. Spinal disorders typically result in symptoms including deformity, pain, nerve damage, and partial or complete loss of mobility. Non-surgical treatments, such as medication, rehabilitation and exercise can be effective, however, may fail to relieve the symptoms associated with these disorders. Surgical treatment of these spinal disorders includes correction, fusion, fixation, discectomy, laminectomy and implantable prosthetics. Correction treatments may employ implants that are manipulated for engagement with vertebrae to position and align one or more vertebrae. This disclosure describes an improvement over these prior art technologies. SUMMARY Accordingly, a surgical system for correction of a spine disorder is provided. In one particular embodiment, in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure, a spinal correction system comprises a first member defining a longitudinal axis and including an inner surface that defines a first cavity and a second cavity. A second member defines a longitudinal axis and includes an inner surface that defines a first cavity and a second cavity. The members are connected along a first axis disposed in substantially parallel relation to the longitudinal axes. At least one first implant support is configured for disposal within the first cavities. At least one second implant support is configured for disposal within the second cavities. The members are rotatable about the first axis to space apart the members such that the inner surfaces forcibly engage the supports in releasable fixation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The exemplary embodiments of the spinal correction system and related methods of use disclosed are discussed in terms of medical devices for the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders and more particularly, in terms of a spinal correction system that facilitates implant delivery and treatment of a spine. It is envisioned that the spinal correction system can include extenders, reducers and translators, which can be used to introduce a vertebral construct such as a rod to a bone fastener, such as a bone anchor or bone screw. For example, an extender can include bone anchor attachment features on one or both sides of the instrument. It is contemplated that the system may be used with a reducer assembly to introduce a rod into a bone fastener. In one embodiment, the system is employed with a method for deformity correction, for example, treatment of scoliosis. It is contemplated that the system is employed for axial derotation of vertebral bodies to improve chest wall volume and pulmonary function. In one embodiment, the system includes pedicle screws placed in the vertebral bodies that provide anchors for spinal manipulation. In one embodiment, the system includes implant supports, such as, for example, extenders attached to the pedicle screws that are configured as derotation levers and are linked together to distribute derotation forces applied to components of the system. In one embodiment, the system is configured for linking two extenders across a single vertebral body in a segmental configuration. In one embodiment, the system is configured for linking extenders across a plurality of vertebral bodies in a global or en bloc configuration. In one embodiment, the system includes a clamping mechanism that includes plates with features to engage an implant support. In one embodiment, the clamping mechanism includes arms hinged together and pivot normal to an axis of an implant support such that the clamping mechanism actuates along the axis. In one embodiment, the clamping mechanism is movable between unlocked and locked positions. For example, in the unlocked position, the clamping mechanism is free to travel along the axis of the implant support. For example, in the locked position, the clamping mechanism is secured with frictional force on the implant support to prevent movement along the axis of the implant support. In one embodiment, the clamping mechanism includes an actuator, which can include, for example, a spring or a screw jack or other manual actuation. This configuration can eliminate locking steps during surgery. In one embodiment, the system facilitates translation of the implant supports in a sagittal plane during derotation. This configuration can improve kyphosis or reduce flat back. In one embodiment, the system includes a segmental link. The segmental link includes plates connected with spaced apart hinges. The plates define slots configured for disposal of concave and convex implant supports. In one embodiment, the link includes a tightening/derotation handle. In one embodiment, the slot geometry includes an opening configured for accommodation of a multi-axial screw (MAS). In one embodiment, the plates are movable between an open position and a clamped position. In one embodiment, the system includes a frame connected with one or a plurality of links, which are configured for disposal with a plurality of vertebral levels. In one embodiment, the link includes one or a plurality of actuators, such as, for example, a tightening handle. In one embodiment, the link includes one or a plurality of derotation handles. In one embodiment, the frame has an adjustment slot with positioning notches. In one embodiment, the frame has a concave hinge that facilitates pivoting and relative movements of links connected to the frame. In one embodiment, the link includes slots configured for disposal of concave and convex extenders. In one embodiment, the link includes slots disposed in a cephalad/caudal orientation, which allows for sagittal plane adjustment. It is envisioned that the spinal correction system may include instruments that are connected or attached to an extender(s) such as, for example, a lateral translation handle or derotation instruments. In one embodiment, one or all of the components of the surgical system are disposable, peel-pack, pre-packed sterile devices used with a spinal correction system. One or all of the components of the spinal correction system may be reusable. The spinal correction system may be configured as a kit with multiple sized and configured components. It is envisioned that the present disclosure may be employed to treat spinal disorders such as, for example, degenerative disc disease, disc herniation, osteoporosis, spondylolisthesis, stenosis, scoliosis and other curvature abnormalities, kyphosis, tumor and fractures. It is contemplated that the present disclosure may be employed with other osteal and bone related applications, including those associated with diagnostics and therapeutics. It is further contemplated that the disclosed surgical system may be alternatively employed in a surgical treatment with a patient in a prone or supine position, and/or employ various surgical approaches to the spine, including anterior, posterior, posterior mid-line, direct lateral, postero-lateral, and/or antero-lateral approaches, and in other body regions. The present disclosure may also be alternatively employed with procedures for treating the lumbar, cervical, thoracic and pelvic regions of a spinal column. The system of the present disclosure may also be used on animals, bone models and other non-living substrates, such as, for example, in training, testing and demonstration. The present disclosure may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of the disclosure taken in connection with the accompanying drawing figures, which form a part of this disclosure. It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to the specific devices, methods, conditions or parameters described and/or shown herein, and that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments by way of example only and is not intended to be limiting of the claimed disclosure. Also, as used in the specification and including the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include the plural, and reference to a particular numerical value includes at least that particular value, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Ranges may be expressed herein as from “about” or “approximately” one particular value and/or to “about” or “approximately” another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent “about,” it will be understood that the particular value forms another embodiment. It is also understood that all spatial references, such as, for example, horizontal, vertical, top, upper, lower, bottom, left and right, are for illustrative purposes only and can be varied within the scope of the disclosure. For example, the references “upper” and “lower” are relative and used only in the context to the other, and are not necessarily “superior” and “inferior”. Further, as used in the specification and including the appended claims, “treating” or “treatment” of a disease or condition refers to performing a procedure that may include administering one or more drugs to a patient (human, normal or otherwise or other mammal), in an effort to alleviate signs or symptoms of the disease or condition. Alleviation can occur prior to signs or symptoms of the disease or condition appearing, as well as after their appearance. Thus, treating or treatment includes preventing or prevention of disease or undesirable condition (e.g., preventing the disease from occurring in a patient, who may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it). In addition, treating or treatment does not require complete alleviation of signs or symptoms, does not require a cure, and specifically includes procedures that have only a marginal effect on the patient. Treatment can include inhibiting the disease, e.g., arresting its development, or relieving the disease, e.g., causing regression of the disease. For example, treatment can include reducing acute or chronic inflammation; alleviating pain and mitigating and inducing re-growth of new ligament, bone and other tissues; as an adjunct in surgery; and/or any repair procedure. Also, as used in the specification and including the appended claims, the term “tissue” includes soft tissue, ligaments, tendons, cartilage and/or bone unless specifically referred to otherwise. The following discussion includes a description of a spinal correction system and related methods of employing the surgical system in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure. Alternate embodiments are also disclosed. Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, which are illustrated in the accompanying figures. Turning now to FIGS. 1-5, there is illustrated components of a surgical system, such as, for example, a spinal correction system 20 in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure. The components of spinal correction system 20 can be fabricated from biologically acceptable materials suitable for medical applications, including metals, synthetic polymers, ceramics and bone material and/or their composites, depending on the particular application and/or preference of a medical practitioner. For example, the components of spinal correction system 20, individually or collectively, can be fabricated from materials such as stainless steel alloys, commercially pure titanium, titanium alloys, Grade 5 titanium, super-elastic titanium alloys, cobalt-chrome alloys, stainless steel alloys, superelastic metallic alloys (e.g., Nitinol, super elasto-plastic metals, such as GUM METAL® manufactured by Toyota Material Incorporated of Japan), ceramics and composites thereof such as calcium phosphate (e.g., SKELITE™ manufactured by Biologix Inc.), thermoplastics such as polyaryletherketone (PAEK) including polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polyetherketoneketone (PEKK) and polyetherketone (PEK), carbon-PEEK composites, PEEK-BaSO4 polymeric rubbers, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), fabric, silicone, polyurethane, silicone-polyurethane copolymers, polymeric rubbers, polyolefin rubbers, hydrogels, semi-rigid and rigid materials, elastomers, rubbers, thermoplastic elastomers, thermoset elastomers, elastomeric composites, rigid polymers including polyphenylene, polyamide, polyimide, polyetherimide, polyethylene, epoxy, bone material including autograft, allograft, xenograft or transgenic cortical and/or corticocancellous bone, and tissue growth or differentiation factors, partially resorbable materials, such as, for example, composites of metals and calcium-based ceramics, composites of PEEK and calcium based ceramics, composites of PEEK with resorbable polymers, totally resorbable materials, such as, for example, calcium based ceramics such as calcium phosphate, tri-calcium phosphate (TCP), hydroxyapatite (HA)-TCP, calcium sulfate, or other resorbable polymers such as polyaetide, polyglyclolide, polytyrosine carbonate, polycaroplaetohe and their combinations. Various components of spinal correction system 20 may have material composites, including the above materials, to achieve various desired characteristics such as strength, rigidity, elasticity, compliance, biomechanical performance, durability and radiolucency or imaging preference. The components of spinal correction system 20, individually or collectively, may also be fabricated from a heterogeneous material such as a combination of two or more of the above-described materials. The components of spinal correction system 20 may be monolithically formed, integrally connected or include fastening elements and/or instruments, as described herein. Spinal correction system 20 is employed, for example, with an open or mini-open, minimal access and/or minimally invasive including percutaneous surgical technique for engagement with an implant, such as, for example, a bone fastener for a correction treatment at a surgical site within a body of a patient, for example, a section of a spine to treat various spine pathologies, such as, for example, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and Scheuermann's kyphosis. In one embodiment, the components of spinal correction system 20 are configured to deliver and introduce an implant, such as, for example, a vertebral construct such as a rod to a bone fastener. Spinal correction system 20 includes a first member, such as, for example, a plate 22 defining a longitudinal axis L1. Plate 22 extends between a first end 24 and a second end 26. Plate 22 defines an inner surface 28. It is contemplated that inner surface 28 may have alternate surface configurations, such as, for example, rough, arcuate, undulating, mesh, porous, semi-porous, dimpled and/or textured according to the requirements of a particular application. Inner surface 28 defines a first cavity, such as, for example, a first elongated slot 30 and a second cavity, such as, for example, a second elongated slot 32. Slots 30, 32 are each configured to receive a surgical instrument, such as, for example, an implant support. Slots 30, 32 are spaced apart along axis L1 and disposed in a transverse plane T (FIG. 6) relative to, for example, vertebrae of a body. In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 2, one of slots 30, 32, such as, for example, slot 32 includes an elongated portion 34 and an arcuate portion 36. Portion 34 is configured for disposal of the implant support along plane T and arcuate portion 36 is configured to prevent rotation of the implant support in plane T and translation of the implant support along axis L1, as discussed herein. It is envisioned that slots 30, 32 may be variously configured and dimensioned, such as, for example, round, oval, oblong, square, rectangular, polygonal, irregular, uniform, non-uniform, offset, staggered, tapered, consistent or variable, depending on the requirements of a particular application. Plate 22 includes a surface 40 that defines a third cavity, such as, for example an opening 38. Inner surface 40 is threaded and opening 38 is configured for disposal of an actuator, discussed herein. It is contemplated that surface 40 may have alternate surface configurations, such as, for example, rough, arcuate, undulating, mesh, porous, semi-porous, dimpled and/or textured according to the requirements of a particular application. Plate 22 includes a raised portion 39 having a face 41 configured for engagement with an actuator, as discussed herein. Spinal correction system 20 includes a second member, such as, for example, a plate 42 defining a longitudinal axis L2. Plate 42 extends between a first end 44 and a second end 46. Plate 42 defines an inner surface 48. It is contemplated that inner surface 48 may have alternate surface configurations, such as, for example, rough, arcuate, undulating, mesh, porous, semi-porous, dimpled and/or textured according to the requirements of a particular application. Inner surface 48 defines a first cavity, such as, for example, a first elongated slot 50 and a second cavity, such as, for example, a second elongated slot 52. Slots 50, 52 are each configured to receive a surgical instrument, such as, for example, an implant support. Slots 50, 52 are spaced apart along axis L2 and disposed in plane T such that at least a portion of slots 30, 50 and slots 32, 52 are substantially aligned. In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 2, one of slots 50, 52, such as, for example, slot 52 includes an elongated portion 54 and an arcuate portion 56. Portion 54 is configured for disposal of the implant support along plane T and arcuate portion 56 is configured to prevent rotation of the implant support in plane T and translation of the implant support along axis L2, as discussed herein. It is contemplated that only one or both of plates 22, 42 may include an arcuate portion, as described herein. In one embodiment, portions 34, 54 support an extender connected with a mono-axial bone screw and portions 36, 56 support an extender connected with a MAS. It is envisioned that slots 50, 52 may be variously configured and dimensioned, such as, for example, round, oval, oblong, square, rectangular, polygonal, irregular, uniform, non-uniform, offset, staggered, tapered, consistent or variable, depending on the requirements of a particular application. Plates 22, 42 are configured to form an apparatus, such as, for example, a segmental link 57. Plate 22 is connected to plate 42 along a first axis A1. Axis A1 is disposed in substantially parallel relation to longitudinal axes L1 and L2. Plates 22, 42 are rotatable about axis A1 between a non-locking configuration and a locking configuration to space apart plates 22, 42 such that inner surfaces 28, 48 forcibly engage the implant supports disposed therein in releasable fixation. In one embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, plates 22, 42 are connected via a first hinge 58 that is spaced apart from a second hinge 58 and extending along axis A1. Hinges 58 facilitate relative rotation of plates 22, 42. System 20 includes an actuator, such as, for example, a screw jack 60 engageable with plates 22, 42. Screw jack 60 actuates link 57 to drive apart plates 22, 42 and rotate plates 22, 42 about axis A1. Screw jack 60 includes an elongated post 62 having a proximal end 59 and a distal end 61. Distal end 61 includes a threaded portion 63 configured to threadably engage surface 40. A flange 65 extends circumferentially about post 62 and is disposed proximal to threaded portion 63. Flange 65 is configured to engage face 41. A handle 64 is mounted with proximal end 59 to facilitate actuation of screw jack 60. Handle 64 is configured for rotation, for example, in a clockwise and counterclockwise direction, to translate threaded portion 63 relative to plate 22 to engage plate 42 to drive apart plates 22, 42. Handle 64 is rotated in a clockwise direction and portion 63 engages plate 42 such that plate 22 is driven apart from plate 42 about axis A1 to a locking configuration, as shown in FIG. 5. In the locking configuration, inner surfaces 28, 48 forcibly engage the implant supports disposed therein in releasable fixation. Handle 64 is rotated in a counter clockwise direction and portion 63 translates out of engagement with plate 42 such that plate 22 is rotated into close proximity and/or contacting relation with plate 42 to a non-locking configuration, as shown in FIG. 4. In the non-locking configuration, the implant supports are released from fixation with plates 28, 48 and freely slidable in the slots, as described. In one embodiment, handle 64 is configured for manipulation and resultant application of one or a plurality of forces and/or moments for application to a body to create for example, a derotation force for a spinal treatment. It is envisioned that handle 64 may be employed to displace, pull, twist or align vertebrae, according to the requirements of a particular application. Handle 64 is rotated to space apart plates 22, 42 in a range corresponding to the translation of screw jack 60 relative to plate 22. Screw jack 60 is configured to engage threaded surface 40 of plate 22 such that screw jack 62 translates along and through opening 38 to engage plate 42. In one embodiment, the range of translation of screw jack 60 relative to plate 22 is between engagement of threaded portion 63 and translation up to engagement of flange 65 and face 41. Engagement of flange 65 and face 41 prevents plates 22, 42 from further rotation and separation. In one embodiment, the actuator includes a spring mechanism (not shown) utilized to space apart and/or draw together plates 22, 42. In operation, the components of system 20 are disposable between a first, non-locking configuration, as shown in FIG. 4 and a second, locking configuration, as shown in FIG. 5. In the non-locking configuration, no appreciable force is applied to the implant supports. The implant supports are freely slidable for transverse translation within slots 30, 50 and/or slots 32, 52. In one embodiment, an implant support can be selectively translated along slots 30, 50 and/or slots 32, 52 and positioned at a selected orientation. In one embodiment, an implant support can be disposed along portions 34, 54, for example, with a mono-axial or fixed axis screw and/or can be disposed with portions 36, 56, for example, with a MAS such that rotation of the implant support is prevented and translation of the implant support along axes L1, L2 is prevented. Handle 64 is rotated in a clockwise direction, in the direction shown by arrow A in FIG. 4, and portion 63 engages plate 42, for example translating in a distal direction relative to plate 22, such that plate 22 is rotated relative to plate 42 about axis A1, in the direction shown by arrow B in FIG. 5, and driven apart from plate 42 to a locking configuration, as shown in FIG. 5. In the locking configuration, inner surfaces 28, 48 forcibly engage the implant supports disposed therein in releasable fixation to dispose the implant supports in the selected position and/or orientation. The pivoting of plate 22 relative to plate 42 drives inner surfaces 28, 48 into fixed engagement with the implant supports. In the locking configuration, plates 22, 42 are locked with the implant supports. The components of system 20 can be released from the locking configuration and pivoted to the non-locking configuration, as shown in FIG. 4. Handle 64 is rotated counter clockwise, in the direction shown by arrow C in FIG. 4, and portion 63 translates out of engagement with plate 42, for example, translating in a proximal direction relative to plate 22, such that plate 22 is rotated relative to plate 42 about axis A1, in the direction shown by arrow D in FIG. 5, into close proximity and/or contacting relation with plate 42 to a non-locking configuration. In the non-locking configuration, the implant supports are released from fixation with plates 22, 42 and freely slidable in the slots, as described. In one embodiment, system 20 includes a first implant support, such as, for example a first extender 66 and a second implant support, such as, for example a second extender 68, as shown in FIG. 6. Extender 66 includes an outer surface 70 configured for disposal with slots 30, 50 and engagement with surfaces 28, 48. In one embodiment, extender 66 is configured for connection with a bone fastener disposed with a concave portion of a spine. Extender 68 includes an outer surface 72 configured for disposal with slots 32, 52 and engagement with surfaces 28, 48. In one embodiment, extender 68 is configured for connection with a bone fastener disposed with a convex portion of a spine. It is contemplated that system 20 may include one or a plurality of extenders disposed with each of the slots. In assembly, operation and use, spinal correction system 20, similar to the system described above, is employed with a surgical procedure, such as, for example, a correction treatment to treat adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and/or Scheuermann's kyphosis of a spine. It is contemplated that one or all of the components of spinal correction system 20 can be delivered or utilized as a pre-assembled device or can be assembled in situ. For example, spinal correction system 20 can be employed with a surgical correction treatment of an applicable condition or injury of an affected section of a spinal column and adjacent areas within a body, such as, for example, vertebral levels V1, V2, V3 of vertebrae V, as shown in FIG. 6. It is envisioned that spinal correction system 20 may be employed with one or a plurality of vertebrae. In use, to treat vertebrae V, a medical practitioner obtains access to a surgical site including vertebrae V in any appropriate manner, such as through incision and retraction of tissues. It is envisioned that spinal correction system 20 can be used in any existing surgical method or technique including open surgery, mini-open surgery, minimally invasive surgery and percutaneous surgical implantation, whereby vertebrae V is accessed through a mini-incision, or sleeve that provides a protected passageway to the area. Once access to the surgical site is obtained, the particular surgical procedure can be performed for treating the spine disorder. An incision is made in the body of a patient and a cutting instrument (not shown) creates a surgical pathway for implantation of components of spinal correction system 20. A preparation instrument (not shown) can be employed to prepare tissue surfaces of vertebrae V1, V2 and V3, as well as for aspiration and irrigation of a surgical region according to the requirements of a particular surgical application. Pilot holes (not shown) are made bilaterally in selected levels of vertebrae V, for example, vertebrae V1, V2 and V3 for receiving bone fasteners 74, 76. Extenders 66, 68 are oriented for manipulation, alignment and capture of bone fasteners 74, 76. Extender 66 is configured for disposal with a concave portion of a selected vertebra of vertebrae V and extender 68 is configured for disposal with a convex portion of a selected vertebra of vertebrae V. Extenders 66, 68 are attached with vertebra V1 via bone fasteners 74, 76, such that the components of system 20 are disposed in the non-locking configuration, as described. Extenders 66, 68 are freely slidable for transverse translation within slots 30, 50 and/or slots 32, 52 such that extenders 66, 68 support can be selectively translated along slots 30, 50 and/or slots 32, 52 and positioned at a selected orientation. Handle 64 is rotated in a clockwise direction, in the direction shown by arrow A in FIG. 4, such that plate 22 is rotated relative to plate 42 about axis A1, in the direction shown by arrow B in FIG. 5, and driven apart from plate 42 to the locking configuration, as shown in FIG. 5 and described above. Inner surfaces 28, 48 forcibly engage extenders 66, 68 in releasable fixation to fixedly dispose extenders 66, 68 in the selected position and/or orientation. Plates 22, 42 are locked with extenders 66, 68. Force is applied to handle 64, for example, via manipulation of a practitioner during a surgical treatment, to displace, pull, twist or align vertebrae, according to the requirements of a particular application. Upon completion of practitioner manipulation, the components of system 20 can be released from the locking configuration and pivoted to the non-locking configuration, as described. In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 7, link 57 is configured with a locking linkage of system 20 employed with fixed axial screws 74, 76. The linkage of system 20 includes a first joint, such as, for example, extender 66 disposed with slots 30, 50 described above, and a second joint, such as, for example, extender 68 disposed with portions 34, 54 described above. The first joint and the second joint facilitate fixing link 57 in the locking configuration, as described herein. In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 8, link 57 is configured with a locking linkage of system 20 employed with a fixed axial screw 74 and a MAS 76. The linkage of system 20 includes a first joint, such as, for example, extender 66 disposed with slots 30, 50 described above, and a second joint, such as, for example, the spherical joint of the MAS crown and the MAS bone screw of MAS 76. Extender 68 is disposed with portions 36, 56 described above, such that link 57 is disposed perpendicular to extender 68 and the rotation of link 57 with extender 68 is fixed. The first joint and the second joint facilitate fixing link 57 in the locking configuration, as described herein. It is envisioned that system 20 may include and/or be employed with various bone fasteners, including those described herein and for example, anchors, expanding screws, wedges, clips, friction fittings, compressive fittings, expanding rivets, staples, nails, fixation plates and/or posts. It is envisioned that the use of microsurgical and image guided technologies may be employed to access, view and repair spinal deterioration or damage, with the aid of spinal correction system 20. Upon completion of the procedure, the non-implanted components, surgical instruments and assemblies are removed and the incision is closed. It is contemplated that the components of spinal correction system 20 may be employed to treat progressive idiopathic scoliosis with or without sagittal deformity in either infantile or juvenile patients, including but not limited to prepubescent children, adolescents from 10-12 years old with continued growth potential, and/or older children whose growth spurt is late or who otherwise retain growth potential. It is further contemplated that the components of spinal correction system 20 and method of use may be used to prevent or minimize curve progression in individuals of various ages. In one embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 9-11, spinal correction system 20, similar to the systems and methods described with regard to FIGS. 1-6, includes a frame 204 comprising a first apparatus 122 and a second apparatus 124. Apparatus 122 includes a first member, such as, for example, a plate 126 defining a longitudinal axis L3. Plate 126 extends between a first end 128 and a second end 130. Plate 126 defines an inner surface 132. Inner surface 132 defines a first cavity, such as, for example, an elongated slot 134 and a second cavity, such as, for example, an elongated slot 136. Slots 134, 136 are each configured to receive an extender, described below. Slots 134, 136 are spaced apart along axis L3 and disposed in a sagittal plane SP1 of a body in a cephalad-caudal orientation. Plate 126 includes a flange 138 extending therefrom. Flange 138 includes a cavity, such as, for example, an opening 140. Opening 140 includes an inner surface 142. Inner surface 142 is threaded and opening 140 is configured for disposal of an actuator, discussed herein. Opening 140 includes a raised portion 139 having a face 141 configured for engagement with an actuator, as discussed herein. Apparatus 122 includes a second member, such as, for example, a plate portion 144 defining a longitudinal axis L4. Plate portion 144 extends between a first end 146 and a second end 148 of frame 204. Plate 144 defines an inner surface 150. Inner surface 150 defines a cavity, such as, for example, an elongated slot 152. Slot 152 is configured to receive an extender, described herein.
