DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS This application references applicant's co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 13/842,438, filed Mar. 15, 2013 (“the '438 application”), which is incorporated by reference for all purposes. At the time of invention, the inventions of the '438 application and the present application were and continue to be commonly owned. Referring now to the drawings, and particularly FIGS. 1 and 2, there is shown a closure system 100 that includes two closure members 102 that mate which each other to secure the panels 104 to each other along an elongated seam 106. The closure members comprise a plurality of magnetic pairs 108 spaced along the elongated seam. Each magnetic pair includes a female component 110 and a male component 112 (individually and collectively, also referred as, “magnetic components” 113). In order to fasten the two panels 104 together, the magnetic components are aligned with corresponding pairs 108, such that an upper contact surface 116 of a female component 110 is attracted to the upper contact surface 118 of the male component 112 via magnetic attraction, e.g., the male component and the female component configured with opposing polarity to provide magnetic attraction therebetween. The closure system 100 can be used in any variety of applications, e.g., clothing, sleeping bag, cushion cover, pillowcase, pillows, bedding, or a tent, among others. In the exemplary embodiment, the first closure member 102 comprises all female components 110, while the second closure member 103 comprising all male components 112 aligned with the corresponding female components. In other embodiments, male and female components can be distributed between both closures members, so long as (magnetic) pairs 108 of components are aligned with each across the first closure member 102 and the second closure member 103. For example, male and female-components can be alternatively spaced on each closure member 102, 103, i.e., every other component alternating between male and female components, with a male component aligned across a female component along the first and the second closure members. With continued reference to FIGS. 1 and 2, the male 112 and the female 110 components each include a plurality of elongated prongs 120 configured to pierce through the panel 104 and/or a supporting member 122. In the exemplary embodiment, the closure members 102, 103 include a supporting member 122 disposed between the magnetic components 113 and the panels 104. The supporting member 122 can be a longitudinally extending band of flexible material, such as fabric, cloth or a flexible polymer material, among others. The magnetic components 113 are attached to the supporting members 122. The prongs 120 of the magnetic components pierce through the supporting member, however, additional attachment means can be used such as adhesive, to secure the magnetic components to the supporting member. With the support member 122 and the magnetic components 113, closure members 102 can be disposed in a continuous roll (not shown), in which case desired lengths of can be provided by cutting portions of the roll in between the magnet components. Such a closure member can also be provided in discrete pieces of predetermined length. The closure members can be used to form a closure system 100 as described herein, by being attached a desired location to connect panels 104. In other embodiments, the magnetic components 113 can be attached in any of a variety of ways known to the art with or without a supporting member 122 disposed between the magnetic components and the panel 104. For example, magnetic components can be directly adhered via adhesive. Alternatively, the magnetic components can be secured in a casing 130, which can then be sewn or otherwise mechanically attached to a panel. In yet other embodiment, magnetic components can be attached directly to the panels with prescribed spacing, excluding a supporting member entirely. With reference now to FIG. 2, the female component 110 comprises the magnet closed within a housing. The female component includes a peripheral ridge 132 that defines a cavity 134 for receiving an upper portion 118 of the male component 112. More particularly, the cavity has a diameter slightly larger than the diameter of the upper portion 118 of the male component, such that the male component is securely received within the cavity. The magnets 108 of the closure system 100 can be disc magnets, and can be retained in a casing 130 having a pair of elongated prongs 120 extending away from the upper surface 116118 for attaching the magnet casing 130 to a the support member 122, with the prongs being positioned at the periphery of the casing. The magnets can be formed from neodymium, and preferably have a magnetic strength of between 36 MGOe and 52 MGOe, more preferably a magnetic strength of 42 MGOe. The magnets can be disposed at approximately equal distances from one another on the support member 122. In the exemplary embodiment, the housing 140 includes an outer housing portion 142 that defines the ridge 146, outer sidewall 148, and outer portions 150 of the prongs 120 (see, e.g., FIGS. 7-9). The magnetic is disposed behind the planar wall 136 of the cavity 134. In the exemplary embodiment, the magnet has a diameter as least as wide as the diameter of the cavity. An interior housing portion 156 is disposed behind the magnet, forming a wall 158 of the magnet compartment 160. The interior housing portion can further include interior portions of the prongs 120, as shown in FIG. 2. The female component 110 can be formed of various materials that enable magnetic attraction. In the exemplary embodiment, the outer housing portion 142 is formed of stainless steel such as 316 stainless steel. The interior housing portion 156 is formed of stainless steel such as 440 stainless steel, which can be beneficial in various usages, e.g., apparel, auto, marine, furnishings, sporting goods, and footwear. In other embodiments, the housing can be formed of other material, e.g., such as polymeric material. The male component 112 comprises a magnet disposed within a magnet compartment defined by the housing 164, that defines an outer surface 162 sized to be received within the cavity 134 of the female component 110. These magnetic components 113 are configured to be magnetically attracted to one another such that the male component is magnetically urged to be received within the cavity. In the exemplary embodiment, the housing 164 of the male component includes an outer housing portion 166 that defines the outer surface 162, outer sidewall 168, and outer portions of the prongs 170 (see, e.g., FIGS. 10-12). The magnetic is disposed behind the planar wall of the cavity. An interior housing portion 172 is disposed behind the magnet, forming a wall of the magnet compartment 174. The interior housing portion can further include interior portions 176 of the prongs, as shown in FIG. 2. In the exemplary embodiment, the outer housing portion 166 of the male component is formed of stainless steel such as 316 stainless steel. The inner housing portion 172 of the male component is formed of stainless steel such as 440 stainless steel. In other embodiments, the housings of the male and the female components can be formed of polymeric material(s). In assembly, the prongs puncture the supporting member and/or panel. The prongs and/or other portions of the housing are then melted to fuse with the supporting member and/or panel. For example, a thermoplastic polyurethane is coated over the magnet. Alternatively, a support member or panel can be punctured by separate structure, thereafter, a melted polymer is dispensed onto the structure into which a magnet is positioned. As a result, the housing for the magnet can be formed by hardening of the polymer. The resulting housings can be structured as discussed herein. It is further noted that hot melts adhesive can be provided to aid in securing the components together (e.g., magnet, housing, supporting member, panel or others). For example, hot melts adhesive can be disposed between the male component (or female component) and the supporting structure or panel, thereby forming a mechanical interlock between the fabrics and magnetic parts. With reference now to FIGS. 7-9, the outer portion of the housing 142 of the female component 110 is shown, to include particular measurements of an exemplary embodiment to conform with a corresponding male component 112 depicted in FIGS. 10-12. These measurements are provided as illustrative and not intended to be limiting. In the exemplary embodiment, the periphery ridge 132 of the female component 112 completely circumscribes the cavity 134. In other embodiments, the ridge 132 can have spaced apart portions. It need not extend about the cavity in an uninterrupted manner. Portions can be spaced about the cavity, while still contributing to securing the male component within the cavity. In the exemplary method of manufacture, the outer portion of the housing 142 is made of a unitary blank of material formed into shape. The disc-shaped magnet is disposed behind the wall of the cavity 134. Thereafter, the interior housing portion 156 is disposed behind the opposing side of the magnet. The interior portion of the housing is made of a unitary blank of material formed into shape. With reference now to FIGS. 13 and 14, a female component 110 and a male component 112 of another embodiment of magnetic components are shown, in accordance with the invention. The male component comprises an outer housing portion 166, a disc-shaped magnet 180 received behind an outer wall 168 of the outer housing portion, and an interior housing portion 172 disposed behind the magnet. The male component includes plurality of prongs 120 that extend from the outer wall 168. The female component 110 is formed by providing a ring portion 184 about a male component 112. It is noted the magnets used in the resulting female component have an opposing polarity than those under in the resulting male component to provide magnetic attraction therebetween. The ring portion includes flaps 186 extending from a cylindrical sidewall 188. The flaps are sized to extend beyond the upper portion 118 of the male component so that they can be folded behind the interior housing portion 172, securing the ring portion in place. With reference now to FIGS. 15-19, the outer portion of the male housing 164 is shown, to include particular measurements of the embodiment of FIG. 13. These measurements are provided as illustrative and not intended to be limiting. The ring portion 184 has a diameter that closely conforms to the upper end of the male housing 164. Magnets chosen for use in the closure system 100 (FIG. 1) have sufficient magnetic strength to securely close an opening for the selected item. For example, when the item is a garment, the magnets should maintain closure despite pressure placed on the garment, the seam, and the closure system 100 via movement by the wearer of the garment. The magnets preferably should stay joined through a full range of movement and withstand the force applied on the garment by that movement, to ensure that the seam does not come unexpectedly apart. Conversely, the magnets should not be so strong as to make the opening of the closure, such as the separation of the panels, overly difficult or cumbersome. In selected embodiments, example of usable magnets for the closure system can include magnets and programmed magnets sold under the brand names MaxField® and Polymagnet®, available from Correlated Magnetic Research LLC. Such magnets can provide a concentrated magnetic flux proximate to the surface of the magnet. In many usages, magnets having a thickness ¾× 1/32 or ¾× 1/16 will often be used; however, the thickness of the magnet and the diameter of the magnet may vary according to its application. For example, magnets, e.g., neodymium, is often in the shape of a disc but may be a square or rectangle or uniquely designed shape for esthetics and fashion. Often, the magnets are axially magnetized in a grade N40 but may go up or down in its strength of the neodymium used depending on application for its use.
