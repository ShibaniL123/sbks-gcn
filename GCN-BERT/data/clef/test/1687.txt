FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel thiazolo[5,4-f]quinazoline compounds and methods that are useful in the amelioration, treatment or control of Down's syndrome or early Alzheimer's disease or in the amelioration, treatment or control of cancers, especially solid tumors. More specifically, the invention relates to DYRK1A and/or DYRK1B inhibitors and to methods for preparing such compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Protein kinases are enzymes which catalyze protein phosphorylation, a key cellular regulatory mechanism which is frequently deregulated in human diseases. Consequently, protein kinases represent interesting targets for the pharmaceutical industry in its search for new therapeutic agents. 518 Human protein kinase genes have been identified in the human kinome (Manning G. et al., Science, 2002, 298, 1912-34). It is well known that protein kinases are key elements in intracellular signaling pathways that control many physiological processes. Most kinases act on both serine and threonine, others act on tyrosine, and a number (dual-specificity kinases) act on all three. Dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinases (DYRKs) comprise a family of protein kinases within the CMGC group of the eukaryotic kinome (CMGC: cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), glycogen synthase kinases (GSKs), and CDK-like kinases (CLKs). The DYRK family comprises five members in humans, DYRK1A, DYRK1B, DYRK2, DYRK3, and DYRK4 (Becker et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1998, 273(40), 25893-902). DYRK1A may play a significant role in a signaling pathway regulating cell proliferation and may be involved in brain development. Expression of DYRK1A is detected in several regions of the central nervous system, from development to adulthood, especially in the cortex, hippocampus and cerrebrellum. Dyrk1A knock-out mice are embryonic lethal and transgenic mice overexpressing Dyrk1A display learning and memory deficiencies. The human DYRK1A gene has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome due to its location on the Down syndrom (DS) critical region of the human chromosome 21 and is present in three copies in DS patients. Trisomy-driven overexpression in DS patients has been demonstrated and DYRK1A overexpression in DS is also associated with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) phenotype observed in DS patients. In DS, the pathogenetic role of enhanced activity of DYRK1A in both neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration makes it a target for therapeutic intervention for cognitive improvement and neuroprotection. However, a number of studies (Kimura et al., Hum. Mol. Genet., .2007, 16(1), 15-23, and Wegiel et al., FEBS J., 2011, 278(2), 236-45 for review) indicate that overexpression of DYRK1A could be a primary risk factor contributing to the enhancement of both amyloidosis and neurofibrillary degeneration seen in DS, but also AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, elevated levels of Aβ peptide may upregulate DYRK1A expression and enhance the contribution of overexpressed DYRK1A to neurofibrillary degeneration and beta-amyloidosis. DYRK1A phosphorylates key players in AD, namely, APP, Tau, presenilin, and septin-4, DYRK1A acts as a priming kinase, allowing its substrates to be further phosphorylated by GSK3, a key kinase in AD. Elevated Aβ levels detected in the hippocampus of DYRK1A transgenic mice and in the brain of DS and AD patients suggest that DYRK1A overexpression promotes APP cleavage and Aβ production. Recent studies by Ryoo et al. (J. Neurochem., 2008, 104(5), 1333-44) revealed that DYRK1A phosphorylates APP at Thr668 in vitro and in mammalian cells. Elevated levels of phospho-APP are observed in AD, particularly in the hippocampus. The phosphorylation of APP at Thr668 may facilitate the cleavage of APP by BACE1 and gamma-secretase and enhance the production of Aβ (Vingtdeux et al., Neurobiol. Dis., 2005, 20(2), 625-37). Dyrk1A may also contribute to Aβ production by controlling PS1 phosphorylation at Thr(354). Elevated Aβ levels are detected in the hippocampus of DYRK1A transgenic mice and in the brain of DS patients, suggesting that DYRK1A overexpression promotes APP cleavage and Aβ production. Inhibition of DYRK1A may thus be particularly useful for the regulation or reduction of the formation of Aβ peptide and consequently, the reduction of beta amyloid plaque formation on the brain. Accordingly, DYRK1A can be useful for the treatment of AD and other amyloid-related disorders. The hypothesis that the elevated activity of DYRK1A contributes to the cognitive deficits in Down syndrome and the development of Alzheimer's disease has stimulated interest in DYRK1A as a potential target for therapeutic inhibitors. The human DYRK1B gene was mapped to chromosome 19 (19q12-13.11) by radiation hybrid analysis (Leder, S., et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., 1999, 254(2), 474-9). The amino acid sequences of DYRK1A and DYRK1B are 84% identical in the N-terminus and the catalytic domain but show no extended sequence similarity in the C-terminal region. DYRK1B contains all motifs characteristic for the DYRK family of protein kinases. In addition, the sequence comprises a bipartite nuclear localization motif. DYRK1B is a muscle- and testis- specific isoform of DYRK1A and is involved in the regulation of nuclear functions. The protein kinase DYRK1B (also referred to as MIRK) mediates survival and differentiation in many tissues. It is believed to be implicated in certain cancers, particularly solid tumors, see Gao J. et al., Cancer Biology & Therapy, 2009, 8:17, 1671-9 (lung cancer cells), Lee, K. et al., Cancer Research, 2000, 60, 3631-7 (colon cancer cells) and Deng, X. et at., Cancer Research, 2006, 66, 4149-58 (pancreatic cancer cells). A major problem in the treatment of cancer arises from quiescent cancer cells that are relatively insensitive to most chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation. Such residual cancer cells can cause tumor regrowth or recurrence when they reenter the cell cycle. Earlier studies showed that levels of the serine/theronine kinase MIRK/DYRK1H are elevated up to 10-fold in quiescent G(0) tumor cells (Ewton, D.Z. et al., Mol. Cancer Ther., 2011, 10(11), 2104-14 and Friedman E., Sarcoma, 2011, 260757. Epub 2011 Apr 13). MIRK/DYRK1B uses several mechanisms to block cell cycling, and MIRK/DYRK1B increases expression of antioxidant genes that decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and increase quiescent cell viability. MIRK/DYRK1B kinase inhibition elevated ROS levels and DNA damage detected by increased phosphorylation of the histone protein H2AX and by S-phase checkpoints. MIRK/DYRK1B kinase inhibitors increased cleavage of the apoptotic proteins PARP and caspase 3, and increased tumor cell kill several-fold by gemcitabine and cisplatin. A phenocopy of these effects occurred following MIRK/DYRK1B depletion, showing drug specificity. MIRK/DYRK1B knockout or depletion had no detectable effect on normal tissue, suggesting that the MIRK/DYRK1B kinase inhibitor could have a selective effect on cancer cells expressing elevated levels of MIRK/DYRK1B kinase (e.g. lung cancer cells, colon cancer cells, pancreatic cancer cells, ovarian cancer cells, osteosarcoma cells, and rhabdomyosarcoma cells). Two plant compounds, epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) and harmine, have been identified as DYRK1A inhibitors in selectivity profiling studies (Brain et al., Biochem., 2003, 371, 199) (Table 1). EGCG was used in cell culture studies to confirm the presumed role of DYRK1A in signalling events and to rescue brain defects of DYRK1A-overexpressing mice (Guedj et al., PLoS ONE, 2009, 4, 4606). A clinical trial was set-up to investigate the clinical benefits and safety of EGCG administration in young adults with DS, to establish short-term EGCG effects (three months) on neurocognitive performance, and to determine the persistency or reversibility of EGCG related effects after three months of discontinued use (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01394796?term=EGCG&rank=3). The first results look promising (M. Dierssen, Journées internationales Jérôme- Lejeune, 24 March 2011, Institut Pasteur, Paris). Harmine is a β-carboline alkaloid that has long been known as a potent inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A. Harmine displays excellent specificity for DYRK1A as a potent ATP competitive inhibitor among 69 protein kinases (GB2447791A and Brain et al., Biochem., 2007, 408, 297). However, harmine also inhibits DYRK1B (5-fold less efficiently) and DYRK2 and DYRK3 (50-fold less efficiently) and its inhibitory effect on monoamine oxidase clearly limits its use as a DYRK1A inhibitor (Göckler N, et al., FEBS J. 2009, 276(21), 6324-37). A number of inhibitors of DYRK1A/1B have been developed. Table 1 below provides the structures of such inhibitors and relevant references disclosing the same. However, there remains a need for new potent and selective inhibitors of DYRK1A and/or DYRK1B. DYRK1A inhibitors will be useful to treat subjects with a central nervous system disease or disorder that is mediated by DYRK1A. DYRK1B inhibitors will be useful to treat subjects with cancers since DYRK1B is overexpressed and mediates survival and differentiation in many cancerous tissues.

The compounds according to the present invention may be prepared by various methods known to those skilled in the art. More preferably, the following chemical routes were carried out. The compounds of Formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may be prepared by any process known to be applicable for the preparation of chemically-related compounds by one skilled in the art. Such processes, when used to prepare compounds of Formula I, or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, are provided as further features of the invention and are illustrated by the following schemes. Starting materials are commercially available or may be obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry. The preparation of such starting materials is described within the accompanying examples. Alternatively starting materials are obtainable by analogous procedures to those illustrated which are within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist. The thiazolo[5,4-f]quinazoline-2-carbonitriles VIIIaa-ib were prepared following scheme 1:N-Boc Protection of 2-amino-5-nitrobenzonitrile using di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in a suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane, in presence of suitable bases such as triethylamine and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine and preferably at room temperature, provides tert-butyl (2-cyano-4-nitrophenyl)carbamate I in high yield. Reduction of the nitro intermediate I, for example by treatment with ammonium formate and a catalytic amount of 10% palladium charcoal preferably in ethanol under microwave irradiation for preferably 30 min at 600W, provides tert-butyl 4-amino-2-cyanophenylcarbamate II in high yield. Treatment of intermediate II by a solution of bromine in dichloromethane in a suitable solvent, such as acetic acid, preferably at room temperature provides tert-butyl 4-amino-3-bromo-2-cyanophenylcarbainate III in a quantitative yield. Intermediate III is reacted with Appel's salt (4,5-dichloro-1,2,3-dithiazolium chloride) (Appel, R. et al., Chem. Ber., 1985, 118, 1632) preferably in dichloromethane at room temperature to afford (Z)-tert-butyl-3-bromo-4-(4-chloro-5H-1,2,3-dithiazol-5-ylideneamino)-2-cyanophenylcarbamate IV. N-Boc deprotection of intermediate IV using di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in a suitable solvent, such acetic acid, preferably under microwave irradiation at 118°C provides (Z)-6-amino-2-bromo-3-(4-chloro-5H-1,2,3-dithiazol-5-ylideneamino)benzonitrile V in a quantitative yield. Cyclization of intermediate V may be accomplished by treatment with copper iodide in a suitable solvent, such as pyridine, preferably under microwave irradiation at 400 W at 130°C for 20 min to obtain 6-aminobenzo[d]thiazole-2,7-dicarbonitrile VI in good yield (Besson, T. et al., J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1, 1998, 3925). Treatment of intermediate VI in a suitable solvent, such as dimethylformamide dimethylacetal, preferably under microwave irradiation at 70°C (600 W) gives (E)-N'-(2,7-dicyanobenzo[d]thiazol-6-yl)-N,N-dimethylformimidamide VII in good yield. Cyclization of intermediate VII in thiazolo[5,4-f]quinazoline-2-carbonitriles VIIIaa-ib may be accomplished by a Dimroth rearrangement using the appropriate aniline or primary amine R3NH2 (preferably 1.5 equivalent) in a suitable solvent, such acetic acid and preferably under microwave irradiation at 118°C (600 W) (Foucourt, A. et al., Tetrahedron, 2010, 66, 4495). Accordingly, the invention relates to a process of synthesis of a thiazoloquinazoline compound of formula I, comprising the steps of: a) condensing Appel's salt (4,5-dichloro-1,2,3-dithiazol-1-iurn chloride ) on a compound of the formula (III) wherein (PG) is an amino protecting group, for instance a Boc group, and Hal is a halogen atom, for instance a Br atom, to form a compound of the formula (IV) b) deprotecting the amino group of the compound of the formula (IV), and cyclising the obtained compound of formula (V) to form a compound of the formula (VI) c) aminating the compound of the formula (VI) obtained in step b) with dimethylformamide dimethylacetal to form a compound of the formula (VII) andd) cyclising the compound of the formula (VII) obtained in step c) to form a tricyclic compound of the formula (VIII) via a Dimroth rearrangement. In a particular embodiment of the process of synthesis of the invention, R7 and R8 are independently selected from a hydrogen atom or an unsubstituted or substituted C1-C5 alkyl group. In particular, both R7 and R8 are hydrogen atoms. In a further embodiment, compound of formula (VIII) can be further N-alkylated to obtain a compound of formula (IX) wherein R2 is an unsubstituted C1-C8 alkyl group. The compounds 1 to 89 were prepared following scheme 2 starting from the thiazolo[5,4-f]quinazoline-2-carbonitriles VIIIaa-ib:The N-methylated-thiazolo[5,4-f]quinazoline-2-carbonitriles IXa-c were obtained by N-alkylation of the thiazolo[5,4-f]quinazoline-2-carbonitriles VIIIja, VIIIda, VIIIha with methyl iodide in a suitable solvent, such as dimethylformamide, in presence of a base, such as sodium hydride and preferably for 1 h at 0°C then for 2 h at room temperature. The amidines 1-34 were prepared from the thiazolo[5,4-f]quinazoline-2-carbonitriles VIIIaa-fa by treatment with the appropriate secondary amine RHN2 (preferably 1.2 equivalent) in a suitable solvent, such as dry THF and preferably for overnight at room temperature (Bénéteau, V., Besson, T. et al., Eur. J. Med. Chem., 1999, 34, 1053). Hydrolysis under basic conditions of thiazolo[5,4-f]quinazoline-2-carbonitriles VIIIaa, VIIIba, VIIIda, VIIIea, VIIIfa, and VIIIia, using preferably a 2.5 N solution of aqueous NaOH in a suitable sovent, such as n-butanol and at reflux preferably for 0.5 h under microwave irradiation, provided respectively amides 35-40 in high yields, and 86 and 87 in modest yields. The imidazoline 41 or oxazole 42 were obtained respectively from thiazolo[5,4-f]quinazoline-2-carbonitriles VIIIaa or VIIIda by treatment by ethylene diamine or ethanolamine, in a suitable solvent, such as dry THF at reflux and preferably under microwave irradiation for 30 min (Testard, A., Besson, T. et al., J. Enz. Inhib. Med. Chem., 2005, 20, 557). The methyl imidates 43-80 were obtained from their corresponding thiazolo[5,4-f]quinazoline-2-carbonitriles VIIIaa-ib or N-methylated-thiazolo[5,4-f]quinazoline-2-carbonitriles IXa-c by treatment with a 0.5 M solution of sodium methoxide in a suitable solvent, such as methanol, and preferably under microwave irradiation at 65°C for 30 min. The ethyl imidates 81-82, the benzyl imidate 83 were prepared similarly to the methyl imidates 43-80 using, respectively, a 0.5 M solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol or a 1.0 M solution of sodium benzyloxide in benzyl alcohol and preferably under microwave irradiation, at 80°C for 30 min (81-82) or 100°C for 30 min (83).

The butyl imidate 88 was prepared from carbonitrile VIIIab with NaOH (2.5 M solution in water) in butanol and preferably under microwave irradiation at 117°C for 30 min. Finally the methyl esters 84 and 89 were prepared in high yield from the methyl imidates 48 and 72 respectively, by treatment, preferably for overnight with a mixture of MeOH/H2O = 60/40 in presence of trifluoroacetic acid (0.1 %) (for 84) or with diluted H2SO4 for 2 h (for 89), and preferably at room temperature. It should be understood that other ways of producing these compounds may be designed by the skilled person, based on common general knowledge and following guidance contained in this application.

The present invention thus also relates to a compound which is an intermediate in scheme 1 above. In particular, the present invention relates to a compound of formula III, IV, V, VI or VII as represented in scheme 1 above. The present invention relates in particular to the specific intermediate compounds herein below mentioned in the examples. The compounds according to the invention can be in the form of salts, particularly acid or base salts, preferably compatible with pharmaceutical use (i.e. pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula (I) are also part of the present invention, since such non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be useful as intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceutycally acceptables salts. Salts of compounds of the invention include pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts, pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts, pharmaceutically acceptable metal salts, ammonium and alkylated ammonium salts. Acid addition salts include salts of inorganic acids as well as organic acids.

Other examples of organic bases include lysine, arginine, guanidine, diethanolamine, choline and the like. The present invention includes in particular cationic salts, for example sodium or potassium salts, or alkyl esters (e.g. methyl or ethyl) of the phosphate group. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts can in particular be prepared by reacting the compound of formula (I) with acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, fonic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, maleic acid, salicylic acid, hydroxynaphthoic acid, ascorbic acid, palmitic acid, succinic acid, benzoic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, tartaric acid and the like in solvents like ethyl acetate, ether, alcohols, acetone, THF, dioxane, etc. Mixture of solvents may also be used. The compounds of the invention can be administered alone, but are generally administered with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, with respect to standard pharmaceutical practice (such as described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing). Accordingly, a further object of this invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I), as defined above, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a particular embodiment, the weight ratio of the compound of formula (I) to the carrier is comprised from 1:99 to 99:1. The carrier must be pharmaceutically "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the invention, in particular with the compound of formula (I) present in the composition, and not injurious to the subject to be treated. According to a particular embodiment, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition as described above, further comprising another pharmaceutically active drug. The compounds are administered in a therapeutically effective amount. Dosages and dosage regimen in which the compounds of formula (I) are administered will vary according to the dosage form, mode of administration, the condition being treated and particulars of the patient being treated. Accordingly, optimal therapeutic concentrations will be best determined at the time and place through routine experimentation. The compounds of formula (I) may be administered by different routes including oral, rectal, nasal, topical, vaginal or parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intra-arterial, intradermal, intraperitoneal) administration. For oral administration, the compounds of formula (I) can be formulated into conventional oral dosage forms such as solid preparations (for examples capsules, tablets), and liquid preparations (for example as syrups, elixirs and concentrated drops). They can be presented in unit dosage form and can be prepared by any method well known to those skilled in the art of pharmacy. The amounts of various compounds encompassed by formula (I) to be administered can be determined by standard procedures taking into account factors such as the compound IC50, EC50, the biological half-life of the compound, the age, size and weight of the patient, and the disease or disorder associated with the patient. The importance of these and other factors to be considered are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Amounts administered also depend on the routes of administration and the degree of oral bioavailability (should the compound be administered via the oral route). For example, for compounds with low oral bioavailability, relatively higher doses may have to be administered. The compounds according to the invention can be used enterally or parenterally. Orally, the compounds according to the invention are suitably administered in the amount from about 0.1 mg per day to 1,000 mg per day. For parenteral, sublingual, intranasal, or intrathecal administration, the compounds according to the invention are suitably used in the amount from about 0.5 to about 100 mg/day; for depo administration and implants from about 0.5 mg/day to about 50 mg/day; for topical administration from about 0.5 mg/day to about 200 mg/day; for rectal administration from about 0.5 mg to about 500 mg. In a preferred aspect, the therapeutically effective amounts for oral administration is from about 1 mg/day to about 100 mg/day; and for parenteral administration from about 5 to about 50 mg daily. In a more preferred aspect, the therapeutically effective amounts for oral administration are from about 5 mg/day to about 50 mg/day. Compound of the present invention can be administered orally using any pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form known in the art for such administration. The vehicle may be any solution, suspension, powder, gel, etc., including isotonic solution, buffered and saline solutions, such as syrups or aqueous suspensions, etc. The compounds may be administered by any suitable route, including systemic delivery, intra-venous, intra-arterial, intra-cerebral or intrathecal injections. Repeated injections may be performed, if desired. The dosage can vary within wide limits and will have to be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case, depending upon several factors known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Agents determining the dosage of dosage the active compounds can be the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the age, health and weight of the recipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; and the effect desired. A daily dosage of active ingredient can be expected to be about 0.001 to about 1000 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, with the preferred dose being about 0.1 to about 30 mg/kg. The daily oral dosage can vary from about 0.01 mg to 1000 mg, 0.1 mg to 100 mg, or 10 mg to 500 mg per day of a compound. The daily dose may be administered as single dose or in divided doses and, in addition, the upper limit can also be exceeded when this is found to be indicated. The compounds of the present invention can be administered in such oral dosage forms as tablets, capsules (each of which can include sustained release or timed release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups, and emulsions. Likewise, they may also be administered in intravenous (bolus or infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or intramuscular form, all using dosage forms well known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts. An effective but non-toxic amount of the compound desired can be employed to treat a disease state for which tubulin polymerisation plays a crucial role. Compounds can be administered by any means that produces contact of the active agent with the agent's site of action in the body of a host, such as a human or a mammal. They can be administered by any conventional means available for use in conjunction with pharmaceuticals, either as individual therapeutic agents or in a combination of therapeutic agents, either administered alone, or administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The compound for the present invention can be administered in intranasal form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches wall known to those of ordinary skill in that art. Oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule containing the active compound can be combined with an oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, inert carrier such as lactose, starch, sucrose, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like; for oral administration in liquid form, the oral drug components can be combined with any oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as butylated hydroxyanisol or alpha-tocopherol. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth, or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, waxes, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methylcellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum, and the like. Compounds of the invention can also be administered in the form of liposomal particulate delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamallar vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes can be formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol, stearylamine, or phosphatidylcholines. Alternatively, compounds of the present invention may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers, such as polymers made of polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide - phenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamide - phenol, or polyethyleneoxide - polylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Polymers may also belong to the class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for examples, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, copolymers of polylactic and polyglycolic acid, polyepsilon caprolactone, polycyanoacylates, etc. or block copolymers of hydrogels. Compounds of the present invention may be formulated into gelatin capsules with the addition of lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and the like as powdered carriers. Similar diluents can be used to make compressed tablets. Both tablets and capsules can be manufactured as sustained release products to provide for continuous release of medication over a period of hours. Compressed tablets can be sugar coated or film coated to mask any unpleasant taste and protect the tablet from the atmosphere, or enteric coated for selective disintegration in the gastrointestinal tract. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration can contain coloring and flavoring to increase patient acceptance. In general, water, a suitable oil, saline, aqueous dextrose (glucose), and related sugar solutions and glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycols are suitable carriers for parenteral solutions. Solutions for parenteral administration preferably contain a water soluble salt of the active ingredient, suitable stabilizing agents, and if necessary, buffer substances. Antioxidizing agents such as sodium bisulfite, sodium sulfite, or ascorbic acid, either alone or combined, are suitable stabilizing agents. Also used are citric acid and its salts and sodium EDTA. In addition, parenteral solutions can contain preservatives, such as benzalkonium chloride, methyl- or propyl-paraben, and chlorobutanol. Methods of use of the compounds of the invention The present invention also relates to a compound of formula (I) as a medicament. Compounds of formula (I) are DYRK1A and/or DYRK1B inhibitors. Accordingly, they can be used in a method for the inhibition of DYRK1A and/or DYRK1B. The method can be an in vivo or in vitro method. In vitro, the invention relates to a method for inhibiting DYRK1A and/or DYRK1B, either in isolated form or contained in a cell, comprising contacting DYRK1A and/or DYRK1B or a cell containing DYRK1A and/or DYRK1B with a compound of formula (I). In vivo, the method is for inhibiting DYRK1A and/or DYRK1B in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to said subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I). The invention further relates to a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I), for the inhibition of DYRK1A and/or DYRK1B. The invention further relates to a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same, for the treatment of a disease related to DYRK1A and/or DYRK1B expression or activity. DYRK1A kinase has been shown to be involved in a number of diseases. In addition to the information provided above, a summary of different diseases and conditions involving DYRK1A is provided below. The present invention thus also relates to compounds for use in a method for the treatment of these specific diseases and conditions, the use comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula (I). Of course, the compounds of formula (I) are expected to be useful for the treatment of any diseases mediated by or involving DYRK1A. DYRK1A has been shown to phosphorylate the tau protein at multiple threonine and serine sites including Thr181, Ser202, Thr202, Thr217, Thr231, Ser396, Ser400, Ser404 and Ser422, both in vitro and in cultured cells. Evidence has been presented that hyperphosphorylation of Tau by DYRK1A is a causative factor in the early onset of Alzheimer disease (AD) in Down's syndrome (DS) patients. Increased DYRK1A immunoreactivity has been reported in the cytoplasm and nuclei of scattered neurons of the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and neocortex in neurodegenerative diseases associated with tau phosphorylation, including AD, DS and Pick disease (Feirer et al., Neurobiol. Dis., 2005, 20(2), 392-400). The elevated activity of DYRK1A contributes to the cognitive deficits in DS and the development of AD. Therefore, it is known that DYRK1A kinase can contribute to DS, AD and Pick disease. DYRK1A can also contribute to other forms of neurodegeneration, including α-synuclein aggregation and fibrillization in Lewy bodies, granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons, and neuronal and astrocyte degeneration with DYRK1A-positive corpora amylacea deposition in aging, AD, DS/AD and other diseases (Kim et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2006, 281(44), 33250-7). Therefore, compounds of formula (I) will be useful for the treatment of central nervous system diseases such as neurodegenerative and neurological diseases and disorders. The term "neurodegenerative diseases" includes but is not limited to DS, AD, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Pick's disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease with tangles, amyotrophic-lateral sclerosis, AIDS-related dementia, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and striatonigral degeneration (SND), which is included with olivopontocerebellar degeneration (OPCD) and Shy Drager syndrome (SDS) in a syndrome known as multiple syndrome atrophy (MSA), brain injury, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and inflammatory pain, regenerative (recovery) treatment of CNS disorders such as spinal cord injury, acute neuronal injury (stroke, traumatic brain injury), guam-parkinsonism-dementia complex, corticobasal neurodegeneration, frontotemporal dementia, mood disorders. In a particular embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is used for treating early onset of AD in DS patients. Furthermore, the compounds of the invention can also be used to treat other forms of neurodegeneration, including α-synuclein aggregation and fibrillization in Lewy bodies, granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons, and neuronal and astrocyte degeneration. They can also be used to treat corpora amylacea deposition in aging, AD, DS/AD and other diseases. The invention also relates to a compound of formula (I) for use for decreasing Aβ production. In particular, the compounds of formula (I) are used to prevent APP cleavage. In particular a compound of formula (I) is used to inhibit the formation of Aβ peptide and consequently, to reduce beta amyloid plaque formation on the brain. A DYRK1A inhibitor of formula (I) thus can be useful for the treatment of AD and other amyloid-related disorders. The expression of DYRK1A in mature brain and retinal neurons (Marti et al., Brain Res., 2003, 964(2), 250-63, Wegiel et al., Brain Res., 2004, 1010(1-2), 69-80, and Laguna et al., Dev. Cell., 2008, 15(6), 841-53) and the implication in synaptic activity of DYRK1A-regulated transcription factors, NFAT (Arron et al., Nature, 2006, 441(7093), 595-600) and CREB (Yang et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2001, 276(43), 39819-24), indicate that altered DYRK1A expression in disease might alter adult neuronal activity in brain and retina. Compounds of formula (I) that inhibit DYRK1A will therefore be useful for improving learning and memory and for counteracting neurological disorders and diseases of the brain and retina. Neurological disorders and diseases of the retina includes but are not limited to retinitis pigmentosa (RP), glaucoma, retinopathies, age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), myopic macular degeneration and neurological complications associated with diabetes in a diabetic individual (i.e. diabetic neuropathy). Alternative splicing is observed with > 95% of the genes and constitutes the main source for protein diversity, generating different protein from the same pre-mRNA by the differential use of splice site. It is estimated that 70 to 95% of the alternative splicing events ultimately result in changes in the protein sequence and that on average, a given gene is subjected to 7 splicing events. This extensive contribution of splicing to the transcriptome's functional diversity also results in a clear implication of splicing dysregulations in the development of the pathophysiology of diseases, such as many human cancers (Venables JP., Cancer Res., 2004, 64(21), 7647-54), muscular dystrophies (Nishida A., Nat. Commun., 2011, 2, 308), premature aging disorders (Koshimizu E., PLoS One., 2011, 6(3), el 7688) and Alzheimer's disease. Splicing diversity in AD brain has been recently associated with both the onset (Miller, J. A., S. Horvath, et al., 2010, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 107(28), 12698-12703) and risk of developing AD and risk of developing AD (Avramopoulos, D., M. Szymanski, et al., 2010, Neurobiol. Aging, Jun 4. [Epub ahead of print]). Therefore, by manipulation of the splicing machinery, it is anticipated that gene translation can be controlled to rectify abnormal splicing. Several kinases including DYRK1A alter the function of the splicesome, controlling the phosphorylation status and activity of splicing factors that control splicesome assembly and are implicated in constitutive and alternative splicing control and splicing site choice. Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention can be used for treating splicing dysregulations observed in diseases such as cancers, muscular dystrophies, premature aging disorders and AD. In particular, the compounds of the invention can be used for rescuing brain defects and for the treatment of diseases implicating deregulations of the splicing and phosphorylation of the tau protein which have been identified in certain neurodegenerative diseases and disorders called tauopathies. Tauopathies are disorders and diseases, and in particular neurological disorders and diseases, characterized by the presence of neuronal tau aggregation, in particular the presence of neurofibrillary tangles. The disclosure thus also relates to the treatment of taupathies by administering a compound of formula (I) to a subject in need thereof. Elevated DYRK1A may also be playing a pathological role in dividing cells, such as in cancer. In pancreatic endocrine neoplasms, microarray hybridization data showed up-regulation of DYRK1A in metastatic pancreatic endocrine neoplasms when compared with nonmetastatic pancreatic endocrine neoplasms, indicative of a role of the kinase in the disease (Hansel et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 2004, 10, 6152-8, 2004). Moreover, DYRK1A is a potent megakaryoblastic tumor-promoting gene that contributed to leukemogenesis through dysregulation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activation. Calcineurin/NFAT pathway inhibition has been implicated in the decreased tumor incidence in adults with DS, the same pathway can be both proleukemic in children and antitumorigenic in adults (Malinge S., et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2012, 122(3), 948-962). Accordingly, the invention also relates to a compound of formula (I) for use in the treatment of abnormal cell division, such as cancer and leukemias. In particular, the compound is used in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic endocrine neoplasms or megakaryoblastic leukemia. Further applications include limiting viral infection, cancerous and neurological complications associated with viral infection. Immortalization is a critical event in virus-related oncogenesis. HPV16, a high-risk tumorigenic virus, has been identified as one of the causative agents for the development of cervical cancer. Subsequent to viral infection, the constitutive expression of the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 plays a number of critical roles in maintaining the transformed phenotype. DYRK1A increases the transforming potential of HPV16-infected cells by stabilizing HPV16E7 oncoprotein through phosphorylation of the threonine 5 and threonine 7 residues (Liang et al., Int. J. Biochem. Cell. Biol., 2008, 40, 2431-41). Additionally, increased expression of DYRK1A in HPV16 immortalized keratinocytes and cervical lesions may serve as a candidate antiapoptotic factor in the Forkhead (FKHR) regulated pathway and initiate immortalization and tumorigenesis. Inversely, knockdown of DYRK1A in the HPV immortalized cells led to increased apoptosis (Chang et al., Int. J. Cancer., 2007, 120(11), 2377-85), indicating that potent and selective inhibitors of DYRK1A may be beneficial for HPV-related cancers. The compounds of formula (I) can thus also be used to limit viral infection and cancerous and neurological complications associated with viral infection. In particular, the compounds of formula (I) can be used to increase apoptosis in HPV-related cancers, in particular in HPV immortalized keratinocytes. Polymorphism (SNP) in DYRK1A was also found to be associated with HIV-1 replication in monocyte-derived macrophages, as well as with progression to AIDS in HIV-1-infected individuals (Bol et al., PLoS One., 2011, 6(2), e17190). Therefore, viral infection may include AIDS. In a particular embodiment, the compound of the present invention is used to reduce viral replication of HIV. Transgenic mice overexpressing DYRK1A exhibit significantly reduced bone mass despite the decreased osteoclastogenesis, which is reminiscent of osteoporotic bone phenotype in Down syndrome patients (Lee et al., J. Biol. Chem., 2009, 284(48), 33343- 51). Thus, further applications include pharmacological modulation of DYRK1A which might be used as a strategy to treat unregulated bone resorption. Therefore, the invention also relates to a compound of formula (I) for use in the treatment of bone resorption. In addition, thanks to their activity on DYRK1B, the compounds of the present invention may be used for the treatment of cancer, in particular solid tumor cancers. The invention therefore also relates to a compound of formula (I), for use in inhibiting DYRK1B in a subject in need thereof. In particular, a compound of formula (I) is used for treating, ameliorating or controlling cancers, including specifically solid tumors, for example lung, pancreatic, colon, ovarian, breast, bone (such as osteosarcoma), prostate cancers and rhabdomyosarcoma in a mammal, specifically a human, comprising administering to said mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Further aspects and advantages of this invention will be disclosed in the following examples, which should be regarded as illustrative.
