DIHYDROPYRIDONE AMIDES AS P2X7 MODULATORS This invention pertains to compounds useful for treatment of diseases associated with Ρ2Χ purinergic receptors, and more particularly to P2X7 modulators usable for treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Ρ2Χ purinergic receptors are ATP-activiated ionotropic receptors having seven subtypes. The Ρ2Χ7 receptor subtype (also known as the Ρ2Ζ receptor) is a ligand-gated ion channel found on mast cells, peripheral macrophages, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, fibroblasts and epidermal langerhans cells. Activation of Ρ2Χ7 receptor on such immune system cells results in release of interleukin-lbeta. (Solle et al., J. Biol. Chemistry 276,125-132, (2001)). The Ρ2Χ7 receptor is also found on microglia, Schwann cells and astrocytes within the central nervous system (Donnelly-Roberts et al., Br. J. Pharmacol.151, 571-579 (2007)). Antagonists of Ρ2Χ7 have been showned to block Ρ2Χ7-mediated IL-lbeta release and Ρ2Χ7-mediated cation flux (Stokes et al., Br. J. Pharmacol.149, 880-887 (2006)). Mice lacking the Ρ2Χ7 receptor show a lack of inflammatory and neuropathic hypersensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli (Chessell et al., Pain114, 386-396 (2005)). Ρ2Χ7 is thus believed to have a role in inflammatory responses (Ferrari et al., J. Immunol. 176, 3877-3883 (2006)) and in the onset and persistence of chronic pain (Honore et al., J. Pharmacol. Ex. Ther. 319, 1376-1385 (2006b)). Modulators of the Ρ2Χ7 receptor thus may have utility in the treatment of disease states such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriasis, allergic dermatitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, airways hyper-responsiveness, septic shock, glomerulonephritis, irritable bowel disease, diabetes and Crohn's disease. Ρ2Χ7 modulators may also be useful for treatment of pain, including chronic pain, neuropathic pain, and pain associated inflammatory processes and degenerative conditions. There is accordingly a need for compounds that act as modulators of Ρ2Χ receptors, including antagonists ofP2X7 receptor, as well as a need for methods of treating diseases, conditions and disorders mediated by P2X7 The present invention satisfies these needs as well as others.

Mammals means any member of the mammalia class including, but not limited to, humans; non-human primates such as chimpanzees and other apes and monkey species; farm animals such as cattle, horses, sheep, goats, and swine; domestic animals such as rabbits, dogs, and cats; laboratory animals including rodents, such as rats, mice, and guinea pigs; and the like. Examples of non-mammals include, but are not limited to, birds, and the like. The term “subject” does not denote a particular age or sex. “Arthritis” means diseases or conditions damage to joints of the body and pain associated with such joint damage. Arithritis includes rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, septic arthritis and gouty arthritis. “Pain” includes, without limitation, inflammatory pain; surgical pain; visceral pain; dental pain; premenstrual pain; central pain; pain due to bums; migraine or cluster headaches; nerve injury; neuritis; neuralgias; poisoning; ischemic injury; interstitial cystitis; cancer pain; viral, parasitic or bacterial infection; post-traumatic injury; or pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome. “Therapeutically effective amount” means an amount of a compound that, when administered to a subject for treating a disease state, is sufficient to effect such treatment for the disease state. The “therapeutically effective amount” will vary depending on the compound, disease state being treated, the severity or the disease treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the route and form of administration, the judgment of the attending medical or veterinary practitioner, and other factors. The terms “those defined above” and “those defined herein” when referring to a variable incorporates by reference the broad definition of the variable as well as preferred, more preferred and most preferred definitions, if any. “Treating” or “treatment” of a disease state includes: (i) preventing the disease state, i.e. causing the clinical symptoms of the disease state not to develop in a subject that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease state, but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease state. (ii) inhibiting the disease state, i.e., arresting the development of the disease state or its clinical symptoms, or (iii) relieving the disease state , i.e., causing temporary or permanent regression of the disease state or its clinical symptoms. The terms “treating”, “contacting” and “reacting” when referring to a chemical reaction means adding or mixing two or more reagents under appropriate conditions to produce the indicated and/or the desired product. It should be appreciated that the reaction which produces the indicated and/or the desired product may not necessarily result directly from the combination of two reagents which were initially added, i.e., there may be one or more intermediates which are produced in the mixture which ultimately leads to the formation of the indicated and/or the desired product.

The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds generally are either available from commercial suppliers, such as Aldrich Chemical Co., or are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references such as Fieser and Fieser’s Reagents for Organic Synthesis', Wiley & Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-15; Rodd’s Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989, Volumes 1-5 and Supplementals; and Organic Reactions, Wiley & Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-40. The following synthetic reaction schemes are merely illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes can be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to the disclosure contained in this Application. The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes can be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to, filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. Such materials can be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data. Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature range of from about -78 °C to about 150 °C, more preferably from about 0 °C to about 125 °C, and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20 °C. Scheme A below illustrates one synthetic procedure usable to prepare specific compounds of formula I, wherein X is halo and may be the same or different upon each occurence, Υ is a leaving group, and A, ρ, q, R1, R6 and R11 are as defined herein. In step 1 of Scheme A, a Grignard reaction is carried out wherein nicotinic acid compound a is reacted with phenyl magnesium halide compound b to afford a phenyl dihydropyridone carboxylic acid compound c. In many embodiments, for example, commercially available 6-chloro-nicotinic acid may be used for compound a. Numerous phenyl magnesium bromide compounds are readily prepared by well known techniques and may be used for compound b. In step 2, dihydropyridone compound c is optionally modified to introduce a leaving group Υ to the acyl moiety of compound d. Carboxylic acid derivative compound d may comprise, for example, a carboxylic acid halide, a carboxylate ester or a carboxylic acid anhydride, depending upon the nature of leaving group Υ. In many embodiments Υ is halo such as chloro, such that compound d may be prepared by treatment of carboxylic acid compound c with oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride, or like halogenating agent. In step 3, an amide coupling reaction is carried out wherein an aniline compound ℮ is reacted with compound d, to afford dihydropyridoneamide compound f, which is a compound of formula I in accordance with the invention. Numerous aniline compounds ℮ are commercially available or are readily prepared using synthetic procedures well known in the art. Such aniline compounds may in many embodiments be made by reduction of the corresponding aryl nitro compounds, as illustrated in the experimental examples below. In the procedure of Scheme A, aniline compound a is shown as a substituted phenyl compound. Other aryl amines such as naphthylamines may be used as well with the invention. Many variations on the procedure of Scheme A are possible and will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art. For example, in certain embodiments step 2 may be omitted, and other amide coupling reaction procedures using EDCI, HATU, BOP, PyBOP or the like, may be used in step 3. Specific details for producing compounds of the invention are described in the Examples section below.

In general, the compounds of the invention will be administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. Suitable dosage ranges are typically 1-500 mg daily, preferably 1-100 mg daily, and most preferably 1-30 mg daily, depending upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used, the route and form of administration, the indication towards which the administration is directed, and the preferences and experience of the medical practitioner involved. One of ordinary skill in the art of treating such diseases will be able, without undue experimentation and in reliance upon personal knowledge and the disclosure of this Application, to ascertain a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of the present invention for a given disease. Compounds of the invention may be administered as pharmaceutical formulations including those suitable for oral (including buccal and sub-lingual), rectal, nasal, topical, pulmonary, vaginal, or parenteral (including intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, subcutaneous and intravenous) administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation. The preferred manner of administration is generally oral using a convenient daily dosage regimen which can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction. A compound or compounds of the invention, together with one or more conventional adjuvants, carriers, or diluents, may be placed into the form of pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosages. The pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms may be comprised of conventional ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active compounds or principles, and the unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be employed. The pharmaceutical compositions may be employed as solids, such as tablets or fdled capsules, semisolids, powders, sustained release formulations, or liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, or fdled capsules for oral use; or in the form of suppositories for rectal or vaginal administration; or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for parenteral use. Formulations containing about one (1) milligram of active ingredient or, more broadly, about 0.01 to about one hundred (100) milligrams, per tablet, are accordingly suitable representative unit dosage forms. The compounds of the invention may be formulated in a wide variety of oral administration dosage forms. The pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms may comprise a compound or compounds of the present invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as the active component. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules. A solid carrier may be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavouring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier generally is a finely divided solid which is a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component generally is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain from about one (1) to about seventy (70) percent of the active compound. Suitable carriers include but are not limited to magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatine, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term “preparation” is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier, providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges may be as solid forms suitable for oral administration. Other forms suitable for oral administration include liquid form preparations including emulsions, syrups, elixirs, aqueous solutions, aqueous suspensions, or solid form preparations which are intended to be converted shortly before use to liquid form preparations. Emulsions may be prepared in solutions, for example, in aqueous propylene glycol solutions or may contain emulsifying agents, for example, such as lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia. Aqueous solutions can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizers, and thickening agents. Aqueous suspensions can be prepared by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other well known suspending agents. Solid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, and may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like. The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g., by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, for example solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol. Examples of oily or nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils (e.g., olive oil), and injectable organic esters (e.g., ethyl oleate), and may contain formulatory agents such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying or suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilization from solution for constitution before use with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water. The compounds of the invention may be formulated for topical administration to the epidermis as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also containing one or more emulsifying agents, stabilizing agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or coloring agents. Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising active agents in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatine and glycerine or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier. The compounds of the invention may be formulated for administration as suppositories. A low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously, for example, by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and to solidify. The compounds of the invention may be formulated for vaginal administration. Pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. The subject compounds may be formulated for nasal administration. The solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example, with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in a single or multidose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering atomizing spray pump. The compounds of the invention may be formulated for aerosol administration, particularly to the respiratory tract and including intranasal administration. The compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of five (5) microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronization. The active ingredient is provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), for example, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane, or carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by a metered valve. Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in a form of a dry powder, for example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidine (PVP). The powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of e.g., gelatine or blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler. When desired, formulations can be prepared with enteric coatings adapted for sustained or controlled release administration of the active ingredient. For example, the compounds of the present invention can be formulated in transdermal or subcutaneous drug delivery devices. These delivery systems are advantageous when sustained release of the compound is necessary and when patient compliance with a treatment regimen is crucial. Compounds in transdermal delivery systems are frequently attached to an skin-adhesive solid support. The compound of interest can also be combined with a penetration enhancer, e.g., Αζοη℮ (1-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one). Sustained release delivery systems are inserted subcutaneously into the subdermal layer by surgery or injection. The subdermal implants encapsulate the compound in a lipid soluble membrane, e.g., silicone rubber, or a biodegradable polymer, e.g., polylactic acid. The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. Other suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulations are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 1995, edited by Ε. W. Martin, Mack Publishing Company, 19th edition, Easton, Pennsylvania. Representative pharmaceutical formulations containing a compound of the present invention are described below.

Example 5 Intracellular Calcium Flux (FLIPR) Assay Compound and Reagent Preparation Stock solutions of compounds were prepared from powders as a 10 mM DMSO stock solution. These solutions were stored at RT during the two week period of these experiments to prevent freeze-thaw of the DMSO stocks. The DMSO stocks were added to the appropriate assay buffer at a concentration of 10 μΜ, and then diluted serially to the final concentrations that were tested. No observable precipitate was formed at any time during this process. The aqueous solutions of compounds as well as ATP (Sigma Α7699) and ΒζΑΤΡ (Sigma Β6396) were prepared fresh for each day of experiment. \ Cell culture: 1321Nl-hP2X 7 and HEK293-rP2X 7 132 INI cells stably expressing the full length human P2X7 gene (1321Nl-hP2X7) and ΗΕΚ293 cells stably expressing the full length rat P2X7 gene (HEK293-rP2X7) were obtained from the Roche Cell Culture Facility. 132 INI-hP2X7 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) high glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and 250 pg/mL G418. HEK293-rP2X7 cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM CaCL, 2 mM MgCL, 2 mM F-Glutamine and 500 pg/ml G418. Cells were split such that they never became >70% confluent. Intracellular Calcium Flux (FLIPR) On the day prior to the experiment, 1321Nl-hP2X7 or HEK293-rP2X7 cells were released into suspension with calcium-free PBS + Versene and washed by centrifugation with calcium-free PBS to remove the Versene. Cells were resuspended in growth medium at a density of 2.5 χ 105 cells/mF and seeded into black walled, clear bottom 96 well plates (50,000 cells/well) approximately 18 hr prior to intracellular calcium flux experiments. On the day of the experiment, plates were washed with FFIPR buffer (calcium- and magnesium-free Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) supplemented with 10 mM Hepes, 2.5 mM probenecid and 2 mM calcium chloride) using a BIO-TEK 96 channel plate washer and incubated with 2 mM fluo-3 dye at 37°C for one hr. The dye was then removed by plate washing and the cells were allowed to equilibrate for 20 min at room temperature with antagonist or vehicle (FFIPR buffer). Agonist (100 μΜ ΒζΑΤΡ final concentration for hP2X7; 5 μΜ ΒζΑΤΡ final concentration or rP2X7) was added online with the FFIPR and fluorescence measurements made at 1 sec intervals for 60 sec followed by 3 sec intervals for a further 4 min (5 min total). A final addition of 5 μΜ ionomycin was made and the maximal BzATP-evoked fluorescence normalized to the maximal ionomycin-evoked fluorescence. Example 6 Human Whole Blood IL-1 β Release Assay Compound & Reagent Preparation 10 mM stock solutions of compounds in DMSO (Sigma D2650) were prepared and used either fresh or after storage at -20°C. Appropriate (200χ) serial dilutions of the compounds were made in DMSO, then freshly diluted 1 to 20 (10χ) with Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS; Mediatech Inc., 21-030), such that final DMSO concentration in the blood always equaled 0.5%. 30 mM ATP (Sigma Α7699) was prepared immediately before use in 50 mM HEPES (Gibco 15630) and the pH adjusted to 7.2 with 1Μ sodium hydroxide. Blood Donors Human blood donors were medication free and restricted from utilizing alcohol or caffeine for at least the 24 hr preceding collection. The blood was collected into sodium heparin vacutainer tubes and used the same day. Assay Method The OptEIA Human IL-1 β ELISA Set, OptEIA Coating Buffer, Assay Diluent and ΤΜΒ Substrate Reagent Set used in the assay were commercially obtained from BD Pharmingen. Blood was diluted 1:1 with Dulbecco’s PBS, LPS (Escherichia Coli 0127:Β8, Sigma L3129) added to a final concentration of 25 ng/mL and incubated for 2 hr at 37°C. 48 pL of this LPS primed blood was added to 6 pL of the 10χ compound in 5% DMSO/PBS in the appropriate well of a 96-well polypropylene plate. The blood and compound were mixed and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 37°C. 6 μ1 of 30 mM ATP was added to the LPS-primed blood + compound, mixed thoroughly and incubated for a further 30 min at 37°C. 96 pL of ELISA assay buffer was added to each well and the plate centrifuged at 4°C 1,200 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was removed and assayed for IL-I β using the OptiEIA kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Serum may be frozen at -20°C prior to assay). IC50S were calculated using XLfit.
