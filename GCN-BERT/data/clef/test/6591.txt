Preparation Example 14-3 : Preparation of 1-(1-isopropylpiperidin-4-yl)butan-1-one
1-(Piperidin-4-yl)butan-1-one hydrochloride (2.51 g, 10.9 mmol) obtained in Preparation Example 14-2 was dissolved in acetonitrile (35 mL). To the resulting solution were added dropwise potassium carbonate (K2CO3) (2.08 g, 18.9 mmol) and 2-iodopropane (CH3CH(I)CH3) (0.99 mL, 14.2 mmol) and the solution was stirred for 18 hrs. The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate, diluted with EtOAc, and washed with water. The washed organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (dimethylchloride/methanol = 10/1) to give the white title compound (2.09 g, 81 %).
