Example 8
DY419.
γ-Aminobutyric acid (1.0 g, 9.69 mmol) and phthalic anhydride (1.72 g, 11.6 mmol) in 30 mL of acetic acid were stirred and refluxed at 120° C. for 6 h. The reaction mixture was poured into water after cooling to room temperature and extracted with ethyl acetate (3×20 mL). The organic layers were combined, washed with brine (2×30 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and evaporated under reduced pressure to give the crude product. Solidified by Hexanes to afford DY419 (FIG. 18) as a white solid (1.85 g, 82% yield), mp 115.0° C. The solid was used for the next step without further purifications.
