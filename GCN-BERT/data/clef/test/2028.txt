BACKGROUND ART Sequence specific oligonucleotide probes (SSOP) can be used to identify nucleic acid sequences. Because the thermodynamic stability of matched duplexes is higher than a mismatched duplex, matched and mismatched duplexes can be identified by setting different hybridization temperatures and conditions. Although hybridization techniques can be a useful tool for correctly identifying a complementary strand, current hybridization methods suffer from various limitations. For example, mismatch discrimination is affected by different mismatched base pairs, nucleic acid sequences, nucleic acid structures, etc. (See, Kawase et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 14(19):7727 (1986); Ikuta et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 15(2):797 (1987); Zhang et al., Biophysical J., 81(2):1133 (2001); Fang et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 29(15):3248 (2001)). The stability difference between a perfectly matched complement and a complement mismatched at only one base can also be quite small, corresponding to as little as 0.5° C. difference in their Tm value (Guo et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 15:331-5 (1997); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,780,233 to Guo et al.). Some methods have been used to enhance the discrimination of single-base mismatches, such as the use of short probes having a length of no more than 15 nt. However, shorter probes are limited by their poor sequence specificity and low hybridization efficiency. In addition, the mismatch identification was also affected by GC percent, and the number and site of mismatched base. (See, Bhaumik et al., J Biomol Struct Dyn., 20(2):199 (2002); Letowski et al., J Microbiol Methods, 57(2):269 (2004)). Alternatively, chemically modified nucleic acids such as locked nucleic acids (LNA) and peptide nucleic acids (PNA) may be used to enhance the discrimination of single-base mismatches. Locked nucleic acids (LNA) are oligonucleotide analogues containing a conformationally restricted nucleotide with a 2′-O, 4′-C-methylene bridge that induces thermal affinities when mixed with complementary single stranded DNA and RNA. (See, Petersen et al., Trends in Biotechnology, 21 (2): 74-81). Peptide nucleic acids (PNA) are synthetic chimeras of nucleobases linked to a peptide backbone. This spacing permits the bases to form, among other possible structures, standard base pairs with natural nucleic acids. However, the lack of the phosphodiester linkage, leading to an electronically neutral species, has important consequences for the base-pairing potential of PNA. Investigations of the stability and kinetics of PNA-DNA (and -RNA) duplex formation have confirmed and quantified the existence of strong base-pairing interactions under various conditions (See, Gabor, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 95: 8562 (1998)). In other methods, some base analogs such as 3-nitropyrrole, were inserted into oligonucleotide probes to increase the differences in thermal stability between hybrids formed with normal and single-nucleotide-variant DNA targets (See, Guo et al., Nat. Biotechnol., 15:331 (1997)). However, existing methods used to enhance the discrimination of single-base mismatches are expensive because LNA, PNA and other base analogs are expensive to synthesize. Furthermore, optimal conditions such as the optimum number and site for these modified nucleic acids in an oligonucleotide probe are not known. Thus, there remains a need for improved low-cost methods for increasing hybridization specificity, and for enhancing the role of SSOP in the gene sequence analysis. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to hybridization methods using a probe comprising naturally occurring nucleotides wherein at least one nucleotide is artificially mutated. The probes for use in the methods of the present invention are highly specific, and may be easily synthesized. The probes are also inexpensive, thereby providing improved low-cost methods for increasing hybridization specificity. More particularly, the artificially mutated probe comprises a sequence complementary to the target nucleic acid molecule, and includes at least one nucleotide that is artificially mismatched relative to a control nucleic acid in addition to any mismatches arising from a variant nucleic acid target containing a sequence variation. The artificial mismatch and the sequence variation positions are separated from one another on the oligonucleotide by six to nine nucleotide positions. The artificial mismatch in the sequence specific oligonucleotide probe encompass but are not limited to base substitution, deletion, and insertion. Under proper hybridization condition, this probe hybridizes with a target nucleotide sequence but not with other nucleotide sequences, thereby preventing false positive or negative results. In one embodiment, the mutation site is near the probe ends. In another embodiment, the length of the sequence specific oligonucleotide probe ranges from 11 to 70 nucleotides, or more particularly, from 15 to 25 nucleotides. Suitable bases for preparing the oligonucleotide probes of the present invention may be selected from naturally occurring nucleotide bases such as adenine, cytosine, guanine, uracil, and thymine. Alternatively, nonnaturally occurring or synthetic nucleotide bases may be used to practice the methods of the invention. Examples of such bases include but are not limited to 8-oxo-guanine, 6-mercaptoguanine, 4-acetylcytidine, 5-(carboxyhydroxyethyl) uridine, 2′-O-methylcytidine, 5-carboxymethylamino-methyl-2-thioridine, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl uridine, dihydrouridine, 2′-O-methylpseudouridine, beta-D-galactosylqueosine, 2′-Omethylguanosine, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenosine, 1-methyladenosine, 1-methylpseudouridine, 1-methylguanosine, 1-methylinosine, 2,2-dimethylguanosine, 2-methyladenosine, 2-methylguanosine, 3-methylcytidine, 5-methylcytidine, N6-methyladenosine, 7-methylguanosine, 5-methylaminomethyluridine, 5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouridine, beta-D-mannosylqueosine, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine, 5-methoxyuridine, 2-methylthio-N6-isopentenyladenosine, N-((9-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-2-methylthiopurine-6-yl)carbamoyl)threonine, N-((9-beta-D-ribofuranosylpurine-6-yl) N-methylcarbamoyl) threonine, uridine-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uridine-5-oxyacetic acid, wybutoxosine, pseudouridine, queosine, 2-thiocytidine, 5-methyl-2-thiouridine, 2-thiouridine, 2-thiouridine, 5-methyluridine, N-((9-beta-D-ribofuranosylpurine-6-yl) carbamoyl) threonine, 2′-O-methyl-5-methyluridine, 2′-O-methyluridine, wybutosine, and 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) uridine, except 1-(2′-Deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranosyl)-3-nitropyrrole.

MODES OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to hybridization methods using a probe comprising naturally occurring nucleotides wherein at least one nucleotide is artificially mutated. In one aspect, the present invention provides a process for hybridizing an oligonucleotide to a first nucleic acid target, the method comprising the steps of: providing an oligonucleotide having a nucleic acid sequence complementary in part to the first target, but comprising at least one artificial mismatch relative to the first target and having a nucleic acid sequence complementary in part to a second target, but comprising at least one artificial mismatch and a true mismatch relative to the second target; where the true mismatch and the artificial mismatch are separated from one another by six to nine nucleotide positions and where the artificial mismatch is a naturally occurring nucleotide base; and combining the oligonucleotide and the first target under selected hybridization conditions to form a first duplex. In another aspect, the present invention provides a process for discriminating between a first nucleic acid target and a second nucleic acid target in a test sample wherein the second nucleic acid target has a sequence variation relative to the first target, the process comprising the steps of: providing an oligonucleotide having a nucleic acid sequence complementary in part to the first target, including at the position of the sequence variation, but comprising an artificially mismatched naturally occurring nucleotide base relative to the targets at a position other than that of the sequence variation, the artificially mismatched base and the sequence variation positions being separated from one another on the oligonucleotide by six to nine nucleotide positions; combining the oligonucleotide and the test sample under selected hybridization conditions to form a product from the group consisting of (a) a first duplex comprising the oligonucleotide and the first target, (b) a second duplex comprising the oligonucleotide and the second target and being less stable than the first duplex, and (c) a mixture comprising both the first duplex and the second duplex; selectively detecting the first duplex comprising the oligonucleotide and the first target or the second duplex comprising the oligonucleotide and the second target. As used herein, a “sequence variation” or “variant” encompasses any change in a target sequence relative to a control or normal nucleic acid target. The difference can be as subtle as a single nucleotide polymorphism, but can also include two or more adjacent or non-adjacent single nucleotide changes, as well as more pronounced changes from the control that can include nucleic acid insertions, deletions, and rearrangements. Such insertions and deletions can be as small as 1 nucleotide, and no upper limit on insertion or deletion size is expected, if the oligonucleotide probe or primer is properly designed. In the present methods, the greatest ΔTm is observed when a single artificial mismatch of a naturally occurring modified nucleotide is introduced six to nine bases away from the true mismatch. At such optimum spacing, the ΔTms are increased by 4-10 degrees Celsius, thereby providing improved discrimination. The following examples are provided to illustrate the present methods, without limiting the scope of the invention. In the Examples below, there are 12 types of mismatches for each base pair, including A/A, A/C, A/G, T/T, T/C, T/G, C/C, C/A, C/T, G/G, G/A, G/T. FIG. 1 shows the site of each nucleotide, wherein the SNP site of the target nucleotide sequence is identified at the zero position. All the other nucleotide sites may be modified employing artificial mutations. Example 1 Three HLA sequences (69 bp) with different Tm values (Tm value of sequence 1>2>3) were detected using a normal probe and an artificially mutated probe with a base inserted at the position between 5th and 6th base from 3′ end of the probe. The SNP site in each sequence is shown in lower case letter and underlined.

These identifiers corresponding to A1, T1, C1, G1, A2, T2, C2, G2, A3, T3, C3 and G3 comprise only one kind of oligonucleotide, and represent a homozygote. Other spots, such as A1G1, comprise A1 and G1 two kinds of 69 nt oligonucleotides, and represent a heterozygote. Other spots named Hex, PC, NC and BC represent quantitative control, positive control, negative control and blank control of microarray, respectively. FIG. 4A and FIG. 4B show the hybridization results using a normal probe and an artificially mutated probe, respectively. In this example, the artificially mutated probe contains an artificially inserted cytosine (“c”) when compared to the normal probe. Compared with the predicted hybridization pattern (as shown in the FIG. 3), FIG. 4A shows some cross hybridization with the normal probe. In contrast, the hybridization results in FIG. 4B has a 100% match with the predicted hybridization pattern. Example 2 In this example, 52 standard HLA samples from International Histocompatibility Working Group (IHWG, located on the world wide web at ihwg.org/shared/cbankservices.htm#ssopref) were detected using a normal probe and an artificial mutated probe artificially substituted at the third base from 5′ end of the probe. Normal probe: 5′-TAMRA-GGAACACACGGAAAGTGAA-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 15) Artificial mutated 5′-TAMRA-GGcACACACGGAAAGTGAA-3 probe: (SEQ ID NO: 16) FIG. 5 shows the microarray spot pattern of PCR samples from 52 standard HLA samples spotted on the slides. These spots named 1-52 represent 1-52 standard HLA samples, respectively. Other spots named Hex, PC, NC and BC represent quantitative control, positive control, negative control and blank control of microarray, respectively. After hybridization, only the 52# HLA standard sample could be hybridized with probes. Other samples comprised at least one mismatched base for the probes. Compared with the predicted hybridization pattern (as shown in FIG. 6), FIG. 7A shows numerous cross hybridization with the normal probe. In contrast, the hybridization results using an artificial mutated probe in FIG. 7B shows a 100% match with the predicted results. Example 3 In this example, standard DNAs from IHWG were detected using a normal probe and an artificially mutated probe wherein the artificial mutation site is separated from the natural SNP site by a 6-mer oligonucleotide. Probe Sequence: 5′ -TATTGGGACGGGGAGAgAC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 17) Alleles which perfectly matched with the probe -------------------C-- Alleles which have one base mismatch with the probe: ----------C--------C-- This probe only matched with HLA-B57 and B58. As shown in FIG. 8, only the standard sample B5802/4703 and B5701 gave positive signals, the other samples all gave negative signals. The optimization experiments indicate that the signal intend to become weaker and more unstable if the artificial mutation site is separated from SNP by <6. Example 4 In this example, standard DNAs from IHWG were detected using a normal probe and an artificially mutated probe wherein the artificial mutation site is separated from the natural SNP site by a 9-mer oligonucleotide. Probe Sequence: 5′ -GGcTCTCACACCCTCCAGA-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 18) The alleles which perfectly matched with the probe: --G------------------- The alleles which have one base mismatch with the probe --G--------A---------- This probe matched with B7, B15, B27, and B5802 also is matched with this probe. The probe mismatched with B5701. FIG. 9 shows that the specificity is very good. The specificity was lower when compared with hybridization results wherein artificial mutation site was separated from SNP by >9. As illustrated in these examples, sequence specific oligonucleotide probes can greatly enhance the discrimination of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). Thus, artificial mutated probes may be used to discriminate mismatched base pairs and duplexes, and may be used for gene typing, such as in HLA typing.
