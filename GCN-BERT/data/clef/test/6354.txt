In this regards, the safety processor 1104 employs the watchdog function to detect and recover from malfunctions of the primary processor 10006. During normal operation, the safety processor 1104 monitors for hardware faults or program errors of the primary processor 1104 and to initiate corrective action or actions. The corrective actions may include placing the primary processor 10006 in a safe state and restoring normal system operation. The safety processor 1104 is coupled to at least a first sensor. The first sensor measures a first property of the surgical instrument 2000. The safety processor 1104 is configured to compare the measured property of the surgical instrument 2000 to a predetermined value. For example, in one embodiment, a motor sensor 1140a is coupled to the safety processor 1104. The motor sensor 1140a provides motor speed and position information to the safety processor 1104. The safety processor 1104 monitors the motor sensor 1140a and compares the value to a maximum speed and/or position value and prevents operation of the motor 1048 above the predetermined values. The predetermined values are calculated based on real-time speed and/or position of the motor 1048, calculated from values supplied by a second motor sensor 1140b in communication with the primary processor 1106, and/or provided to the safety processor 1104 from a memory module coupled to the safety processor 1104. A second sensor is coupled to the primary processor 1106. The second sensor is configured to measure the first physical property. The safety processor 1104 and the primary processor 1106 are configured to provide a signal indicative of the value of the first sensor and the second sensor respectively. When either the safety processor 1104 or the primary processor 1106 indicates a value outside of an acceptable range, the segmented circuit 1100 prevents operation of at least one of the circuit segments 1102c-1102h, such as the motor segment 1102g. For example, in the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5, the safety processor 1104 is coupled to a first motor position sensor 1140a and the primary processor 1106 is coupled to a second motor position sensor 1140b. The motor position sensors 1140a, 1140b may comprise any suitable motor position sensor, such as a magnetic angle rotary input comprising a sine and cosine output. The motor position sensors 1140a, 1140b provide respective signals to the safety processor 1104 and the primary processor 1106 indicative of the position of the motor 1048. The safety processor 1104 and the primary processor 1106 generate an activation signal when the values of the first motor sensor 1140a and the second motor sensor 1140b are within a predetermined range. When either the primary processor 1106 or the safety processor 1104 to detect a value outside of the predetermined range, the activation signal is terminated and operation of at least one circuit segment 1102c-1102h, such as the motor segment 1102g, is interrupted and/or prevented. For example, in some embodiments, the activation signal from the primary processor 1106 and the activation signal from the safety processor 1104 are coupled to an AND gate. The AND gate is coupled to a motor power switch 1120. The AND gate maintains the motor power switch 1120 in a closed, or on, position when the activation signal from both the safety processor 1104 and the primary processor 1106 are high, indicating a value of the motor sensors 1140a, 1140b within the predetermined range. When either of the motor sensors 1140a, 1140b detect a value outside of the predetermined range, the activation signal from that motor sensor 1140a, 1140b is set low, and the output of the AND gate is set low, opening the motor power switch 1120. The value of the first sensor 1140a and the second sensor 1140b is compared by the safety processor 1104 and/or the primary processor 1106. When the values of the first sensor and the second sensor are different, the safety processor 1104 and/or the primary processor 1106 may prevent operation of the motor segment 1102g. The safety processor 1104 receives a signal indicative of the value of the second sensor 1140b and compares the second sensor value to the first sensor value. For example, in one embodiment, the safety processor 1104 is coupled directly to a first motor sensor 1140a. A second motor sensor 1140b is coupled to a primary processor 1106, which provides the second motor sensor 1140b value to the safety processor 1104, and/or coupled directly to the safety processor 1104. The safety processor 1104 compares the value of the first motor sensor 1140 to the value of the second motor sensor 1140b. When the safety processor 1104 detects a mismatch between the first motor sensor 1140a and the second motor sensor 1140b, the safety processor 1104 may interrupt operation of the motor segment 1102g by cutting power to the motor segment 1102g. The safety processor 1104 and/or the primary processor 1106 is coupled to a first sensor 1140a configured to measure a first property of a surgical instrument and a second sensor 1140b configured to measure a second property of the surgical instrument. The first property and the second property comprise a predetermined relationship when the surgical instrument is operating normally. The safety processor 1104 monitors the first property and the second property. When a value of the first property and/or the second property inconsistent with the predetermined relationship is detected, a fault occurs. When a fault occurs, the safety processor 1104 takes at least one action, such as preventing operation of at least one of the circuit segments, executing a predetermined operation, and/or resetting the primary processor 1106. For example, the safety processor 1104 may open the motor power switch 1120 to cut power to the motor circuit segment 1102g when a fault is detected. FIG. 6 illustrates a block diagram of a segmented circuit 1200 comprising a safety processor 1204 configured to monitor and compare a first property and a second property of a surgical instrument, such as the surgical instrument 2000 illustrated in FIGS. 1-3. The safety processor 1204 is coupled to a first sensor 1246 and a second sensor 1266. The first sensor 1246 is configured to monitor a first physical property of the surgical instrument 2000. The second sensor 1266 is configured to monitor a second physical property of the surgical instrument 2000. The first and second properties comprise a predetermined relationship when the surgical instrument 2000 is operating normally. For example the first sensor 1246 comprises a motor current sensor configured to monitor the current draw of a motor from a power source. The motor current draw is indicative of the speed of the motor. The second sensor comprises a linear hall sensor configured to monitor the position of a cutting member within an end effector an end effector 2006 coupled to the surgical instrument 2000. The position of the cutting member is used to calculate a cutting member speed within the end effector 2006. The cutting member speed has a predetermined relationship with the speed of the motor when the surgical instrument 2000 is operating normally. The safety processor 1204 provides a signal to the main processor 1206 indicating that the first sensor 1246 and the second sensor 1266 are producing values consistent with the predetermined relationship. When the safety processor 1204 detects a value of the first sensor 1246 and/or the second sensor 1266 inconsistent with the predetermined relationship, the safety processor 1206 indicates an unsafe condition to the primary processor 1206. The primary processor 1206 interrupts and/or prevents operation of at least one circuit segment. The safety processor 1204 is coupled directly to a switch configured to control operation of one or more circuit segments. For example, with reference to FIG. 5 the safety processor 1104 is coupled directly to a motor power switch 1120. The safety processor 1104 opens the motor power switch 1120 to prevent operation of the motor segment 1102g when a fault is detected. Referring back to FIG. 5, the safety processor 1104 is configured to execute an independent control algorithm. In operation, the safety processor 1104 monitors the segmented circuit 1100 and is configured to control and/or override signals from other circuit components, such as the primary processor 1106, independently. The safety processor 1104 may execute a preprogrammed algorithm and/or may be updated or programmed on the fly during operation based on one or more actions and/or positions of the surgical instrument 2000. For example the safety processor 1104 is reprogrammed with new parameters and/or safety algorithms each time a new shaft and/or end effector is coupled to the surgical instrument 2000. One or more safety values stored by the safety processor 1104 are duplicated by the primary processor 1106. Two-way error detection is performed to ensure values and/or parameters stored by either of the processors 1104, 1106 are correct. The safety processor 1104 and the primary processor 1106 implement a redundant safety check. The safety processor 1104 and the primary processor 1106 provide periodic signals indicating normal operation. For example, during operation, the safety processor 1104 may indicate to the primary processor 1106 that the safety processor 1104 is executing code and operating normally. The primary processor 1106 may, likewise, indicate to the safety processor 1104 that the primary processor 1106 is executing code and operating normally. In some embodiments, communication between the safety processor 1104 and the primary processor 1106 occurs at a predetermined interval. The predetermined interval may be constant or may be variable based on the circuit state and/or operation of the surgical instrument 2000. FIG. 7 is a block diagram illustrating a safety process 1250 configured to be implemented by a safety processor, such as the safety process 1104 illustrated in FIG. 5. In one embodiment, values corresponding to a plurality of properties of a surgical instrument 2000 are provided to the safety processor 1104. The plurality of properties is monitored by a plurality of independent sensors and/or systems. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, a measured cutting member speed 1252, a propositional motor speed 1254, and an intended direction of motor signal 1256 are provided to a safety processor 1104. The cutting member speed 1252 and the propositional motor speed 1254 may be provided by independent sensors, such as a linear hall sensor and a current sensor respectively. The intended direction of motor signal 1256 may be provided by a primary processor the primary processor 1106 illustrated in FIG. 5. The safety processor 1104 compares 1258 the plurality of properties and determines when the properties are consistent with a predetermined relationship. When the plurality of properties comprises values consistent with the predetermined relationship 1260a, no action is taken 1262. When the plurality of properties comprises values inconsistent with the predetermined relationship 1260b, the safety processor 1104 executes one or more actions, such as blocking a function, executing a function, and/or resetting a processor. For example, in the process 1250 illustrated in FIG. 7, the safety processor 1104 interrupts operation of one or more circuit segments, such as by interrupting power 1264 to a motor segment. Referring back to FIG. 5, the segmented circuit 1100 comprises a plurality of switches 1156-1170 configured to control one or more operations of the surgical instrument 2000. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the segmented circuit 1100 comprises a clamp release switch 1168, a firing trigger 1166, and a plurality of switches 1158a-1164b configured to control articulation of a shaft 2004 and/or end effector 2006 coupled to the surgical instrument 2000. The clamp release switch 1168, the fire trigger 1166, and the plurality of articulation switches 1158a-1164b may comprise analog and/or digital switches. In particular, switch 1156 indicates the mechanical switch lifter down position, switches 1158a, 1158b indicate articulate left (1) and (2), switch 1160a, 1160b indicate articulate right (1) and (2), switches 1162a, 1162b indicate articulate center (1) and (2), and switches 1164a, 1164b indicate reverse/left and reverse/right. For example, FIG. 8 illustrates a switch bank 1300 comprising a plurality of switches SW1-SW16 configured to control one or more operations of a surgical instrument. The switch bank 1300 may be coupled to a primary processor, such as the primary processor 1106. One or more diodes D1-D8 are coupled to the plurality of switches SW1-SW16. Any suitable mechanical, electromechanical, or solid state switches may be employed to implement the plurality of switches 1156-1170, in any combination. For example, the switches 1156-1170 may limit switches operated by the motion of components associated with the surgical instrument 2000 or the presence of an object. Such switches may be employed to control various functions associated with the surgical instrument 2000. A limit switch is an electromechanical device that consists of an actuator mechanically linked to a set of contacts. When an object comes into contact with the actuator, the device operates the contacts to make or break an electrical connection. Limit switches are used in a variety of applications and environments because of their ruggedness, ease of installation, and reliability of operation. They can determine the presence or absence, passing, positioning, and end of travel of an object. In other implementations, the switches 1156-1170 may be solid state switches that operate under the influence of a magnetic field such as Hall-effect devices, magneto-resistive (MR) devices, giant magneto-resistive (GMR) devices, magnetometers, among others. In other implementations, the switches 1156-1170 may be solid state switches that operate under the influence of light, such as optical sensors, infrared sensors, ultraviolet sensors, among others. Still, the switches 1156-1170 may be solid state devices such as transistors (e.g., FET, Junction-FET, metal-oxide semiconductor-FET (MOSFET), bipolar, and the like). Other switches may include wireless switches, ultrasonic switches, accelerometers, inertial sensors, among others. FIG. 9 illustrates a switch bank 1350 comprising a plurality of switches. One or more switches are configured to control one or more operations of a surgical instrument, such as the surgical instrument 2000 illustrated in FIGS. 1-3. A plurality of articulation switches SW1-SW16 is configured to control articulation of a shaft 2004 and/or an end effector 2006 coupled to the surgical instrument 2000. A firing trigger 1366 is configured to fire the surgical instrument 2000 to deploy a plurality of staples, translate a cutting member within the end effector 2006, and/or deliver electrosurgical energy to the end effector 2006. The switch bank 1350 comprises one or more safety switches configured to prevent operation of the surgical instrument 2000. For example, a bailout switch 1356 is coupled to a bailout door and prevents operation of the surgical instrument 2000 when the bailout door is in an open position. FIG. 10 illustrates a segmented circuit 1400 comprising a switch bank 1450 coupled to the primary processor 1406. The switch bank 1450 is similar to the switch bank 1350 illustrated in FIG. 9. The switch bank 1450 comprises a plurality of switches SW1-SW16 configured to control one or more operations of a surgical instrument, such as the surgical instrument 2000 illustrated in FIGS. 1-3. The switch bank 1450 is coupled to an analog input of the primary processor 1406. Each of the switches within the switch bank 1450 is further coupled to an input/output expander 1463 coupled to a digital input of the primary processor 1406. The primary processor 1406 receives input from the switch bank 1450 and controls one or more additional segments of the segmented circuit 1400, such as a motor segment 1402g in response to manipulation of one or more switches of the switch bank 1450. A potentiometer 1469 is coupled to the primary processor 1406 to provide a signal indicative of a clamp position of an end effector 2006 coupled to the surgical instrument 2000. The potentiometer 1469 may replace and/or supplement a safety processor (not shown) by providing a signal indicative of a clamp open/closed position used by the primary processor 1106 to control operation of one or more circuit segments, such as the motor segment 1102g. For example, when the potentiometer 1469 indicates that the end effector is in a fully clamped position and/or a fully open position, the primary processor 1406 may open the motor power switch 1420 and prevent further operation of the motor segment 1402g in a specific direction. The primary processor 1406 controls the current delivered to the motor segment 1402g in response to a signal received from the potentiometer 1469. For example, the primary processor 1406 may limit the energy that can be delivered to the motor segment 1402g when the potentiometer 1469 indicates that the end effector is closed beyond a predetermined position. Referring back to FIG. 5, the segmented circuit 1100 comprises an acceleration segment 1102c. The acceleration segment comprises an accelerometer 1122. The accelerometer 1122 may be coupled to the safety processor 1104 and/or the primary processor 1106. The accelerometer 1122 is configured to monitor movement of the surgical instrument 2000. The accelerometer 1122 is configured to generate one or more signals indicative of movement in one or more directions. For example, in some embodiments, the accelerometer 1122 is configured to monitor movement of the surgical instrument 2000 in three directions. Alternatively or in addition, the acceleration segment 1102c comprises a plurality of accelerometers 1122, each configured to monitor movement in a signal direction. The accelerometer 1122 is configured to initiate a transition to and/or from a sleep mode, e.g., between sleep-mode and wake-up mode and vice versa. Sleep mode may comprise a low-power mode in which one or more of the circuit segments 1102a-1102g are deactivated or placed in a low-power state. For example the accelerometer 1122 remains active in sleep mode and the safety processor 1104 is placed into a low-power mode in which the safety processor 1104 monitors the accelerometer 1122, but otherwise does not perform any functions. The remaining circuit segments 1102b-1102g are powered off. The primary processor 1104 and/or the safety processor 1106 are configured to monitor the accelerometer 1122 and transition the segmented circuit 1100 to sleep mode when no movement is detected within a predetermined time period. Although described in connection with the safety processor 1104 monitoring the accelerometer 1122, the sleep-mode / wake-up mode may be implemented by the safety processor 1104 monitoring any of the sensors, switches, or other indicators associated with the surgical instrument 2000 as described herein. For example, the safety processor 1104 may monitor an inertial sensor, or a one or more switches. The segmented circuit 1100 transitions to sleep mode after a predetermined period of inactivity. A timer is in signal communication with the safety processor 1104 and/or the primary processor 1106. The timer may be integral with the safety processor 1104, the primary processor 1106, and/or may be a separate circuit component. The timer is configured to monitor a time period since a last movement of the surgical instrument 2000 was detected by the accelerometer 1122. When the counter exceeds a predetermined threshold, the safety processor 1104 and/or the primary processor 1106 transitions the segmented circuit 1100 into sleep mode. The timer is reset each time the accelerometer 1122 detects movement. All circuit segments except the accelerometer 1122, or other designated sensors and/or switches, and the safety processor 1104 are deactivated when in sleep mode. The safety processor 1104 monitors the accelerometer 1122, or other designated sensors and/or switches. When the accelerometer 1122 indicates movement of the surgical instrument 2000, the safety processor 1104 initiates a transition from sleep mode to operational mode. In operational mode, all of the circuit segments 1102a-1102h are fully energized and the surgical instrument 2000 is ready for use. The safety processor 1104 transitions the segmented circuit 1100 to the operational mode by providing a signal to the primary processor 1106 to transition the primary processor 1106 from sleep mode to a full power mode. The primary processor 1106, then transitions each of the remaining circuit segments 1102d-1102h to operational mode. The transition to and/or from sleep mode may comprise a plurality of stages. For example the segmented circuit 1100 transitions from the operational mode to the sleep mode in four stages. The first stage is initiated after the accelerometer 1122 has not detected movement of the surgical instrument for a first predetermined time period. After the first predetermined time period the segmented circuit 1100 dims a backlight of the display segment 1102d. When no movement is detected within a second predetermined period, the safety processor 1104 transitions to a second stage, in which the backlight of the display segment 1102d is turned off. When no movement is detected within a third predetermined time period, the safety processor 1104 transitions to a third stage, in which the polling rate of the accelerometer 1122 is reduced. When no movement is detected within a fourth predetermined time period, the display segment 1102d is deactivated and the segmented circuit 1100 enters sleep mode. In sleep mode, all of the circuit segments except the accelerometer 1122 and the safety processor 1104 are deactivated. The safety processor 1104 enters a low-power mode in which the safety processor 1104 only polls the accelerometer 1122. The safety processor 1104 monitors the accelerometer 1122 until the accelerometer 1122 detects movement, at which point the safety processor 1104 transitions the segmented circuit 1100 from sleep mode to the operational mode. The safety processor 1104 transitions the segmented circuit 1100 to the operational mode only when the accelerometer 1122 detects movement of the surgical instrument 2000 above a predetermined threshold. By responding only to movement above a predetermined threshold, the safety processor 1104 prevents inadvertent transition of the segmented circuit 1100 to operational mode when the surgical instrument 2000 is bumped or moved while stored. The accelerometer 1122 is configured to monitor movement in a plurality of directions. For example, the accelerometer 1122 may be configured to detect movement in a first direction and a second direction. The safety processor 1104 monitors the accelerometer 1122 and transitions the segmented circuit 1100 from sleep mode to operational mode when movement above a predetermined threshold is detected in both the first direction and the second direction. By requiring movement above a predetermined threshold in at least two directions, the safety processor 1104 is configured to prevent inadvertent transition of the segmented circuit 1100 from sleep mode due to incidental movement during storage. The accelerometer 1122 is configured to detect movement in a first direction, a second direction, and a third direction. The safety processor 1104 monitors the accelerometer 1122 and is configured to transition the segmented circuit 1100 from sleep mode only when the accelerometer 1122 detects oscillating movement in each of the first direction, second direction, and third direction. Oscillating movement in each of a first direction, a second direction, and a third direction correspond to movement of the surgical instrument 2000 by an operator and therefore transition to the operational mode is desirable when the accelerometer 1122 detects oscillating movement in three directions. As the time since the last movement detected increases, the predetermined threshold of movement required to transition the segmented circuit 1100 from sleep mode also increases. For example, in some embodiments, the timer continues to operate during sleep mode. As the timer count increases, the safety processor 1104 increases the predetermined threshold of movement required to transition the segmented circuit 1100 to operational mode. The safety processor 1104 may increase the predetermined threshold to an upper limit. For example, in some embodiments, the safety processor 1104 transitions the segmented circuit 1100 to sleep mode and resets the timer. The predetermined threshold of movement is initially set to a low value, requiring only a minor movement of the surgical instrument 2000 to transition the segmented circuit 1100 from sleep mode. As the time since the transition to sleep mode, as measured by the timer, increases, the safety processor 1104 increases the predetermined threshold of movement. At a time T, the safety processor 1104 has increased the predetermined threshold to an upper limit. For all times T+, the predetermined threshold maintains a constant value of the upper limit. One or more additional and/or alternative sensors are used to transition the segmented circuit 1100 between sleep mode and operational mode. For example a touch sensor is located on the surgical instrument 2000. The touch sensor is coupled to the safety processor 1104 and/or the primary processor 1106. The touch sensor is configured to detect user contact with the surgical instrument 2000. For example, the touch sensor may be located on the handle of the surgical instrument 2000 to detect when an operator picks up the surgical instrument 2000. The safety processor 1104 transitions the segmented circuit 1100 to sleep mode after a predetermined period has passed without the accelerometer 1122 detecting movement. The safety processor 1104 monitors the touch sensor and transitions the segmented circuit 1100 to operational mode when the touch sensor detects user contact with the surgical instrument 2000. The touch sensor may comprise a capacitive touch sensor, a temperature sensor, and/or any other suitable touch sensor. The touch sensor and the accelerometer 1122 may be used to transition the device between sleep mode and operation mode. For example, the safety processor 1104 may only transition the device to sleep mode when the accelerometer 1122 has not detected movement within a predetermined period and the touch sensor does not indicate a user is in contact with the surgical instrument 2000. Those skilled in the art will recognize that one or more additional sensors may be used to transition the segmented circuit 1100 between sleep mode and operational mode. The touch sensor is only monitored by the safety processor 1104 when the segmented circuit 1100 is in sleep mode. The safety processor 1104 is configured to transition the segmented circuit 1100 from sleep mode to the operational mode when one or more handle controls are actuated. After transitioning to sleep mode, such as after the accelerometer 1122 has not detected movement for a predetermined period, the safety processor 1104 monitors one or more handle controls, such as the plurality of articulation switches 1158a-1164b. Alternatively or in addition, the one or more handle controls comprise a clamp control 1166, a release button 1168, and/or any other suitable handle control. An operator of the surgical instrument 2000 may actuate one or more of the handle controls to transition the segmented circuit 1100 to operational mode. When the safety processor 1104 detects the actuation of a handle control, the safety processor 1104 initiates the transition of the segmented circuit 1100 to operational mode. Because the primary processor 1106 is in not active when the handle control is actuated, the operator can actuate the handle control without causing a corresponding action of the surgical instrument 2000. FIG. 16 illustrates a segmented circuit 1900 comprising an accelerometer 1922 configured to monitor movement of a surgical instrument, such as the surgical instrument 2000 illustrated in FIGS. 1-3. A power segment 1902 provides power from a battery 1908 to one or more circuit segments, such as the accelerometer 1922. The accelerometer 1922 is coupled to a processor 1906. The accelerometer 1922 is configured to monitor movement the surgical instrument 2000. The accelerometer 1922 is configured to generate one or more signals indicative of movement in one or more directions. For example, in some embodiments, the accelerometer 1922 is configured to monitor movement of the surgical instrument 2000 in three directions. The processor 1906 may be an LM 4F230H5QR, available from Texas Instruments. The processor 1906 is configured to monitor the accelerometer 1922 and transition the segmented circuit 1900 to sleep mode when no movement is detected within a predetermined time period. The segmented circuit 1900 transitions to sleep mode after a predetermined period of inactivity. For example, a safety processor 1904 may transitions the segmented circuit 1900 to sleep mode after a predetermined period has passed without the accelerometer 1922 detecting movement. In certain instances, the accelerometer 1922 may be an LIS331DLM, available from STMicroelectronics. A timer is in signal communication with the processor 1906. The timer may be integral with the processor 1906 and/or may be a separate circuit component. The timer is configured to count time since a last movement of the surgical instrument 2000 was detected by the accelerometer 1922. When the counter exceeds a predetermined threshold, the processor 1906 transitions the segmented circuit 1900 into sleep mode. The timer is reset each time the accelerometer 1922 detects movement. The accelerometer 1922 is configured to detect an impact event. For example, when a surgical instrument 2000 is dropped, the accelerometer 1922 will detect acceleration due to gravity in a first direction and then a change in acceleration in a second direction (caused by impact with a floor and/or other surface). As another example, when the surgical instrument 2000 impacts a wall, the accelerometer 1922 will detect a spike in acceleration in one or more directions. When the accelerometer 1922 detects an impact event, the processor 1906 may prevent operation of the surgical instrument 2000, as impact events can loosen mechanical and/or electrical components. Only impacts above a predetermined threshold prevent operation. Alternatively or in addition, all impacts are monitored and cumulative impacts above a predetermined threshold may prevent operation of the surgical instrument 2000. With reference back to FIG. 5, the segmented circuit 1100 comprises a power segment 1102h. The power segment 1102h is configured to provide a segment voltage to each of the circuit segments 1102a-1102g. The power segment 1102h comprises a battery 1108. The battery 1108 is configured to provide a predetermined voltage, such as 12 volts through battery connector 1110. One or more power converters 1114a, 1114b, 1116 are coupled to the battery 1108 to provide a specific voltage. For example, in the illustrated embodiments, the power segment 1102h comprises an axillary switching converter 1114a, a switching converter 1114b, and a low-drop out (LDO) converter 1116. The switch converters 1114a, 1114b are configured to provide 3.3 volts to one or more circuit components. The LDO converter 1116 is configured to provide 5.0 volts to one or more circuit components. The power segment 1102h comprises a boost converter 1118. A transistor switch (e.g., N-Channel MOSFET) 1115 is coupled to the power converters 1114b, 1116. The boost converter 1118 is configured to provide an increased voltage above the voltage provided by the battery 1108, such as 13 volts. The boost converter 1118 may comprise a capacitor, an inductor, a battery, a rechargeable battery, and/or any other suitable boost converter for providing an increased voltage. The boost converter 1118 provides a boosted voltage to prevent brownouts and/or low-power conditions of one or more circuit segments 1102a-1102g during power-intensive operations of the surgical instrument 2000. The embodiments, however, are not limited to the voltage range(s) described in the context of this specification. The segmented circuit 1100 is configured for sequential start-up. An error check is performed by each circuit segment 1102a-1102g prior to energizing the next sequential circuit segment 1102a-1102g. FIG. 11 illustrates a process for sequentially energizing a segmented circuit 1270, such as the segmented circuit 1100. When a battery 1108 is coupled to the segmented circuit 1100, the safety processor 1104 is energized 1272. The safety processor 1104 performs a self-error check 1274. When an error is detected 1276a, the safety processor stops energizing the segmented circuit 1100 and generates an error code 1278a. When no errors are detected 1276b, the safety processor 1104 initiates 1278b power-up of the primary processor 1106. The primary processor 1106 performs a self-error check. When no errors are detected, the primary processor 1106 begins sequential power-up of each of the remaining circuit segments 1278b. Each circuit segment is energized and error checked by the primary processor 1106. When no errors are detected, the next circuit segment is energized 1278b. When an error is detected, the safety processor 1104 and/or the primary process stops energizing the current segment and generates an error 1278a. The sequential start-up continues until all of the circuit segments 1102a-1102g have been energized. The segmented circuit 1100 transitions from sleep mode following a similar sequential power-up process 1250. FIG. 12 illustrates a power segment 1502 comprising a plurality of daisy chained power converters 1514, 1516, 1518. The power segment 1502 comprises a battery 1508. The battery 1508 is configured to provide a source voltage, such as 12V. A current sensor 1512 is coupled to the battery 1508 to monitor the current draw of a segmented circuit and/or one or more circuit segments. The current sensor 1512 is coupled to an FET switch 1513. The battery 1508 is coupled to one or more voltage converters 1509, 1514, 1516. An always on converter 1509 provides a constant voltage to one or more circuit components, such as a motion sensor 1522. The always on converter 1509 comprises a 3.3V converter. The always on converter 1509 may provide a constant voltage to additional circuit components, such as a safety processor (not shown). The battery 1508 is coupled to a boost converter 1518. The boost converter 1518 is configured to provide a boosted voltage above the voltage provided by the battery 1508. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the battery 1508 provides a voltage of 12V. The boost converter 1518 is configured to boost the voltage to 13V. The boost converter 1518 is configured to maintain a minimum voltage during operation of a surgical instrument the surgical instrument 2000 illustrated in FIGS. 1-3. Operation of a motor can result in the power provided to the primary processor 1506 dropping below a minimum threshold and creating a brownout or reset condition in the primary processor 1506. The boost converter 1518 ensures that sufficient power is available to the primary processor 1506 and/or other circuit components, such as the motor controller 1543, during operation of the surgical instrument 2000. The boost converter 1518 is coupled directly one or more circuit components, such as an OLED display 1588. The boost converter 1518 is coupled to a one or more step-down converters to provide voltages below the boosted voltage level. A first voltage converter 1516 is coupled to the boost converter 1518 and provides a first stepped-down voltage to one or more circuit components. In the illustrated embodiment, the first voltage converter 1516 provides a voltage of 5V. The first voltage converter 1516 is coupled to a rotary position encoder 1540. A FET switch 1517 is coupled between the first voltage converter 1516 and the rotary position encoder 1540. The FET switch 1517 is controlled by the processor 1506.

The boost converter 1518, the first voltage converter 1516, and the second voltage converter 1514 are coupled in a daisy chain configuration. The daisy chain configuration allows the use of smaller, more efficient converters for generating voltage levels below the boosted voltage level. The embodiments, however, are not limited to the particular voltage range(s) described in the context of this specification. FIG. 13 illustrates a segmented circuit 1600 configured to maximize power available for critical and/or power intense functions. The segmented circuit 1600 comprises a battery 1608. The battery 1608 is configured to provide a source voltage such as 12V. The source voltage is provided to a plurality of voltage converters 1609, 1618. An always-on voltage converter 1609 provides a constant voltage to one or more circuit components a motion sensor 1622 and a safety processor 1604. The always-on voltage converter 1609 is directly coupled to the battery 1608. The always-on converter 1609 provides a voltage of 3.3V. The embodiments, however, are not limited to the particular voltage range(s) described in the context of this specification. The segmented circuit 1600 comprises a boost converter 1618. The boost converter 1618 provides a boosted voltage above the source voltage provided by the battery 1608, such as 13V. The boost converter 1618 provides a boosted voltage directly to one or more circuit components, such as an OLED display 1688 and a motor controller 1643. By coupling the OLED display 1688 directly to the boost converter 1618, the segmented circuit 1600 eliminates the need for a power converter dedicated to the OLED display 1688. The boost converter 1618 provides a boosted voltage to the motor controller 1643 and the motor 1648 during one or more power intensive operations of the motor 1648, such as a cutting operation. The boost converter 1618 is coupled to a step-down converter 1616. The step-down converter 1616 is configured to provide a voltage below the boosted voltage to one or more circuit components, such as 5V. The step-down converter 1616 is coupled to an FET switch 1651 and a position encoder 1640. The FET switch 1651 is coupled to the primary processor 1606. The primary processor 1606 opens the FET switch 1651 when transitioning the segmented circuit 1600 to sleep mode and/or during power intensive functions requiring additional voltage delivered to the motor 1648. Opening the FET switch 1651 deactivates the position encoder 1640 and eliminates the power draw of the position encoder 1640. The embodiments, however, are not limited to the particular voltage range(s) described in the context of this specification. The step-down converter 1616 is coupled to a linear converter 1614. The linear converter 1614 is configured to provide a voltage of 3.3V. The linear converter 1614 is coupled to the primary processor 1606. The linear converter 1614 provides an operating voltage to the primary processor 1606. The linear converter 1614 may be coupled to one or more additional circuit components. The embodiments, however, are not limited to the particular voltage range(s) described in the context of this specification. The segmented circuit 1600 comprises a bailout switch 1656. The bailout switch 1656 is coupled to a bailout door on the surgical instrument 2000. The bailout switch 1656 and the safety processor 1604 are coupled to an AND gate 1619. The AND gate 1619 provides an input to a FET switch 1613. When the bailout switch 1656 detects a bailout condition, the bailout switch 1656 provides a bailout shutdown signal to the AND gate 1619. When the safety processor 1604 detects an unsafe condition, such as due to a sensor mismatch, the safety processor 1604 provides a shutdown signal to the AND gate 1619. In some embodiments, both the bailout shutdown signal and the shutdown signal are high during normal operation and are low when a bailout condition or an unsafe condition is detected. When the output of the AND gate 1619 is low, the FET switch 1613 is opened and operation of the motor 1648 is prevented. The safety processor 1604 utilizes the shutdown signal to transition the motor 1648 to an off state in sleep mode. A third input to the FET switch 1613 is provided by a current sensor 1612 coupled to the battery 1608. The current sensor 1612 monitors the current drawn by the circuit 1600 and opens the FET switch 1613 to shut-off power to the motor 1648 when an electrical current above a predetermined threshold is detected. The FET switch 1613 and the motor controller 1643 are coupled to a bank of FET switches 1645 configured to control operation of the motor 1648. A motor current sensor 1646 is coupled in series with the motor 1648 to provide a motor current sensor reading to a current monitor 1647. The current monitor 1647 is coupled to the primary processor 1606. The current monitor 1647 provides a signal indicative of the current draw of the motor 1648. The primary processor 1606 may utilize the signal from the motor current 1647 to control operation of the motor to ensure the current draw of the motor 1648 is within an acceptable range, to compare the current draw of the motor 1648 to one or more other parameters of the circuit 1600 such as the position encoder 1640, and/or to determine one or more parameters of a treatment site. The current monitor 1647 may be coupled to the safety processor 1604. Actuation of one or more handle controls, such as a firing trigger, causes the primary processor 1606 to decrease power to one or more components while the handle control is actuated. For example a firing trigger controls a firing stroke of a cutting member. The cutting member is driven by the motor 1648. Actuation of the firing trigger results in forward operation of the motor 1648 and advancement of the cutting member. During firing, the primary processor 1606 closes the FET switch 1651 to remove power from the position encoder 1640. The deactivation of one or more circuit components allows higher power to be delivered to the motor 1648. When the firing trigger is released, full power is restored to the deactivated components by closing the FET switch 1651 and reactivating the position encoder 1640. The safety processor 1604 controls operation of the segmented circuit 1600. For example, the safety processor 1604 may initiate a sequential power-up of the segmented circuit 1600, transition of the segmented circuit 1600 to and from sleep mode, and/or may override one or more control signals from the primary processor 1606. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the safety processor 1604 is coupled to the step-down converter 1616. The safety processor 1604 controls operation of the segmented circuit 1600 by activating or deactivating the step-down converter 1616 to provide power to the remainder of the segmented circuit 1600. FIG. 14 illustrates a power system 1700 comprising a plurality of daisy chained power converters 1714, 1716, 1718 configured to be sequentially energized. The plurality of daisy chained power converters 1714,1716,1718 may be sequentially activated by a safety processor during initial power-up and/or transition from sleep mode. The safety processor may be powered by an independent power converter (not shown). For example when a battery voltage VBATT is coupled to the power system 1700 and/or an accelerometer detects movement in sleep mode, the safety processor initiates a sequential start-up of the daisy chained power converters 1714, 1716, 1718. The safety processor activates the 13V boost section 1718. The boost section 1718 is energized and performs a self-check. The boost section 1718 comprises an integrated circuit 1720 configured to boost the source voltage and to perform a self check. A diode D prevents power-up of a 5V supply section 1716 until the boost section 1718 has completed a self-check and provided a signal to the diode D indicating that the boost section 1718 did not identify any errors. This signal is provided by the safety processor. The embodiments, however, are not limited to the particular voltage range(s) described in the context of this specification. The 5V supply section 1716 is sequentially powered-up after the boost section 1718. The 5V supply section 1716 performs a self-check during power-up to identify any errors in the 5V supply section 1716. The 5V supply section 1716 comprises an integrated circuit 1715 configured to provide a step-down voltage from the boost voltage and to perform an error check. When no errors are detected, the 5V supply section 1716 completes sequential power-up and provides an activation signal to the 3.3V supply section 1714. The safety processor provides an activation signal to the 3.3V supply section 1714. The 3.3V supply section comprises an integrated circuit 1713 configured to provide a step-down voltage from the 5V supply section 1716 and perform a self-error check during power-up. When no errors are detected during the self-check, the 3.3V supply section 1714 provides power to the primary processor. The primary processor is configured to sequentially energize each of the remaining circuit segments. By sequentially energizing the power system 1700 and/or the remainder of a segmented circuit, the power system 1700 reduces error risks, allows for stabilization of voltage levels before loads are applied, and prevents large current draws from all hardware being turned on simultaneously in an uncontrolled manner. The embodiments, however, are not limited to the particular voltage range(s) described in the context of this specification. The power system 1700 comprises an over voltage identification and mitigation circuit. The over voltage identification and mitigation circuit is configured to detect a monopolar return current in the surgical instrument and interrupt power from the power segment when the monopolar return current is detected. The over voltage identification and mitigation circuit is configured to identify ground floatation of the power system. The over voltage identification and mitigation circuit comprises a metal oxide varistor. The over voltage identification and mitigation circuit comprises at least one transient voltage suppression diode. FIG. 15 illustrates a segmented circuit 1800 comprising an isolated control section 1802. The isolated control section 1802 isolates control hardware of the segmented circuit 1800 from a power section (not shown) of the segmented circuit 1800. The control section 1802 comprises a primary processor 1806, a safety processor (not shown), and/or additional control hardware a FET Switch 1817. The power section comprises a motor, a motor driver, and/or a plurality of motor MOSFETS. The isolated control section 1802 comprises a charging circuit 1803 and a rechargeable battery 1808 coupled to a 5V power converter 1816. The charging circuit 1803 and the rechargeable battery 1808 isolate the primary processor 1806 from the power section. The rechargeable battery 1808 is coupled to a safety processor and any additional support hardware. Isolating the control section 1802 from the power section allows the control section 1802 the primary processor 1806, to remain active even when main power is removed, provides a filter, through the rechargeable battery 1808, to keep noise out of the control section 1802, isolates the control section 1802 from heavy swings in the battery voltage to ensure proper operation even during heavy motor loads, and/or allows for real-time operating system (RTOS) to be used by the segmented circuit 1800. The rechargeable battery 1808 provides a stepped-down voltage to the primary processor, such as 3.3V. The embodiments, however, are not limited to the particular voltage range(s) described in the context of this specification. FIG. 17 illustrates a process for sequential start-up of a segmented circuit, such as the segmented circuit 1100 illustrated in FIG. 5. The sequential start-up process 1820 begins when one or more sensors initiate a transition from sleep mode to operational mode. When the one or more sensors stop detecting state changes 1822, a timer is started 1824. The timer counts the time since the last movement/interaction with the surgical instrument 2000 was detected by the one or more sensors. The timer count is compared 1826 to a table of sleep mode stages by the safety processor 1104. When the timer count exceeds one or more counts for transition to a sleep mode stage 1828a, the safety processor 1104 stops energizing 1830 the segmented circuit 1100 and transitions the segmented circuit 1100 to the corresponding sleep mode stage. When the timer count is below the threshold for any of the sleep mode stages 1828b, the segmented circuit 1100 continues to sequentially energize the next circuit segment 1832. With reference back to FIG. 5, the segmented circuit 1100 comprises one or more environmental sensors to detect improper storage and/or treatment of a surgical instrument. For example the segmented circuit 1100 comprises a temperature sensor. The temperature sensor is configured to detect the maximum and/or minimum temperature that the segmented circuit 1100 is exposed to. The surgical instrument 2000 and the segmented circuit 1100 comprise a design limit exposure for maximum and/or minimum temperatures. When the surgical instrument 2000 is exposed to temperatures exceeding the limits a temperature exceeding the maximum limit during a sterilization technique, the temperature sensor detects the overexposure and prevents operation of the device. The temperature sensor may comprise a bi-metal strip configured to disable the surgical instrument 2000 when exposed to a temperature above a predetermined threshold, a solid-state temperature sensor configured to store temperature data and provide the temperature data to the safety processor 1104, and/or any other suitable temperature sensor. The accelerometer 1122 is configured as an environmental safety sensor. The accelerometer 1122 records the acceleration experienced by the surgical instrument 2000. Acceleration above a predetermined threshold may indicate that the surgical instrument has been dropped. The surgical instrument comprises a maximum acceleration tolerance. When the accelerometer 1122 detects acceleration above the maximum acceleration tolerance, safety processor 1104 prevents operation of the surgical instrument 2000. The segmented circuit 1100 comprises a moisture sensor. The moisture sensor is configured to indicate when the segmented circuit 1100 has been exposed to moisture. The moisture sensor may comprise an immersion sensor configured to indicate when the surgical instrument 2000 has been fully immersed in a cleaning fluid, a moisture sensor configured to indicate when moisture is in contact with the segmented circuit 1100 when the segmented circuit 1100 is energized, and/or any other suitable moisture sensor. The segmented circuit 1100 comprises a chemical exposure sensor. The chemical exposure sensor is configured to indicate when the surgical instrument 2000 has come into contact with harmful and/or dangerous chemicals. For example, during a sterilization procedure, an inappropriate chemical may be used that leads to degradation of the surgical instrument 2000. The chemical exposure sensor may indicate inappropriate chemical exposure to the safety processor 1104, which may prevent operation of the surgical instrument 2000. The segmented circuit 1100 is configured to monitor a number of usage cycles. For example the battery 1108 comprises a circuit configured to monitor a usage cycle count. The safety processor 1104 is configured to monitor the usage cycle count. Usage cycles may comprise surgical events initiated by a surgical instrument, such as the number of shafts 2004 used with the surgical instrument 2000, the number of cartridges inserted into and/or deployed by the surgical instrument 2000, and/or the number of firings of the surgical instrument 2000. A usage cycle may comprise an environmental event, such as an impact event, exposure to improper storage conditions and/or improper chemicals, a sterilization process, a cleaning process, and/or a reconditioning process. A usage cycle may comprise a power assembly (e.g., battery pack) exchange and/or a charging cycle. The segmented circuit 1100 may maintain a total usage cycle count for all defined usage cycles and/or may maintain individual usage cycle counts for one or more defined usage cycles. For example the segmented circuit 1100 may maintain a single usage cycle count for all surgical events initiated by the surgical instrument 2000 and individual usage cycle counts for each environmental event experienced by the surgical instrument 2000. The usage cycle count is used to enforce one or more behaviors by the segmented circuit 1100. For example, usage cycle count may be used to disable a segmented circuit 1100 by disabling a battery 1108, when the number of usage cycles exceeds a predetermined threshold or exposure to an inappropriate environmental event is detected. The usage cycle count is used to indicate when suggested and/or mandatory service of the surgical instrument 2000 is necessary. FIG. 18 illustrates a method 1950 for controlling a surgical instrument comprising a segmented circuit, such as the segmented control circuit 1602 illustrated in FIG. 12. At 1952, a power assembly 1608 is coupled to the surgical instrument. The power assembly 1608 may comprise any suitable battery, such as the power assembly 2006 illustrates in FIGS. 1-3.

At 1954, the power assembly 1608 energizes a voltage boost convertor 1618. The voltage boost convertor 1618 is configured to provide a set voltage. The set voltage comprises a voltage greater than the source voltage provided by the power assembly 1608. For example, the set voltage comprises a voltage of 13V. In a third step 1956, the voltage boost convertor 1618 energizes one or more voltage regulators to provide one or more operating voltages to one or more circuit components. The operating voltages comprise a voltage less than the set voltage provided by the voltage boost convertor. The boost convertor 1618 is coupled to a first voltage regulator 1616 configured to provide a first operating voltage. The first operating voltage provided by the first voltage regulator 1616 is less than the set voltage provided by the voltage boost convertor. For example, the first operating voltage comprises a voltage of 5V. The boost convertor is coupled to a second voltage regulator 1614. The second voltage regulator 1614 is configured to provide a second operating voltage. The second operating voltage comprises a voltage less than the set voltage and the first operating voltage. For example, the second operating voltage comprises a voltage of 3.3V. The battery 1608, voltage boost convertor 1618, first voltage regulator 1616, and second voltage regulator 1614 are configured in a daisy chain configuration. The battery 1608 provides the source voltage to the voltage boost convertor 1618. The voltage boost convertor 1618 boosts the source voltage to the set voltage. The voltage boost convertor 1618 provides the set voltage to the first voltage regulator 1616. The first voltage regulator 1616 generates the first operating voltage and provides the first operating voltage to the second voltage regulator 1614. The second voltage regulator 1614 generates the second operating voltage. One or more circuit components are energized directly by the voltage boost convertor 1618. For example, an OLED display 1688 is coupled directly to the voltage boost convertor 1618. The voltage boost convertor 1618 provides the set voltage to the OLED display 1688, eliminating the need for the OLED to have a power generator integral therewith. A processor, such as the safety processor 1604 illustrated in FIG. 5, is verifies the voltage provided by the voltage boost convertor 1618 and/or the one or more voltage regulators 1616, 1614. The safety processor 1604 is configured to verify a voltage provided by each of the voltage boost convertor 1618 and the voltage regulators 1616, 1614. The safety processor 1604 verifies the set voltage. When the set voltage is equal to or greater than a first predetermined value, the safety processor 1604 energizes the first voltage regulator 1616. The safety processor 1604 verifies the first operational voltage provided by the first voltage regulator 1616. When the first operational voltage is equal to or greater than a second predetermined value, the safety processor 1604 energizes the second voltage regulator 1614. The safety processor 1604 then verifies the second operational voltage. When the second operational voltage is equal to or greater than a third predetermined value, the safety processor 1604 energizes each of the remaining circuit components of the segmented circuit 1600.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that reconditioning of a device may utilize a variety of techniques for disassembly, cleaning/replacement, and reassembly. Use of such techniques, and the resulting reconditioned device, are all within the scope of the present application. By way of example only, embodiments described herein may be processed before surgery. First, a new or used instrument may be obtained and when necessary cleaned. The instrument may then be sterilized. In one sterilization technique, the instrument is placed in a closed and sealed container, such as a plastic orTYVEK bag. The container and instrument may then be placed in a field of radiation that can penetrate the container, such as gamma radiation, x-rays, or high-energy electrons. The radiation may kill bacteria on the instrument and in the container. The sterilized instrument may then be stored in the sterile container. The sealed container may keep the instrument sterile until it is opened in a medical facility. A device also may be sterilized using any other technique known in the art, including but not limited to beta or gamma radiation, ethylene oxide, or steam. One skilled in the art will recognize that the herein described components (e.g., operations), devices, objects, and the discussion accompanying them are used as examples for the sake of conceptual clarity and that various configuration modifications are contemplated. Consequently, as used herein, the specific exemplars set forth and the accompanying discussion are intended to be representative of their more general classes. In general, use of any specific exemplar is intended to be representative of its class, and the non-inclusion of specific components (e.g., operations), devices, and objects should not be taken limiting. With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application. The various singular/plural permutations are not expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity. The herein described subject matter sometimes illustrates different components contained within, or connected with, different other components. It is to be understood that such depicted architectures are merely examples and that in fact many other architectures may be implemented which achieve the same functionality. In a conceptual sense, any arrangement of components to achieve the same functionality is effectively "associated" such that the desired functionality is achieved. Hence, any two components herein combined to achieve a particular functionality can be seen as "associated with" each other such that the desired functionality is achieved, irrespective of architectures or intermedial components. Likewise, any two components so associated also can be viewed as being "operably connected," or "operably coupled," to each other to achieve the desired functionality, and any two components capable of being so associated also can be viewed as being "operably couplable," to each other to achieve the desired functionality. Specific examples of operably couplable include but are not limited to physically mateable and/or physically interacting components, and/or wirelessly interactable, and/or wirelessly interacting components, and/or logically interacting, and/or logically interactable components. Some aspects may be described using the expression "coupled" and "connected" along with their derivatives. It should be understood that these terms are not intended as synonyms for each other. For example, some aspects may be described using the term "connected" to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact with each other. In another example, some aspects may be described using the term "coupled" to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical or electrical contact. The term "coupled," however, also may mean that two or more elements are not in direct contact with each other, but yet still co-operate or interact with each other. In some instances, one or more components may be referred to herein as "configured to," "configurable to," "operable/operative to," "adapted/adaptable," "able to," "conformable/conformed to," etc. Those skilled in the art will recognize that "configured to" can generally encompass active-state components and/or inactive-state components and/or standby-state components, unless context requires otherwise. While particular aspects of the present subject matter described herein have been shown and described, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that, based upon the teachings herein, changes and modifications may be made without departing from the subject matter described herein and its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as are within the true scope of the subject matter described herein. It will be understood by those within the art that, in general, terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are generally intended as "open" terms (e.g., the term "including" should be interpreted as "including but not limited to," the term "having" should be interpreted as "having at least," the term "includes" should be interpreted as "includes but is not limited to," etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that when a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases "at least one" and "one or more" to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles "a" or "an" limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to claims containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases "one or more" or "at least one" and indefinite articles such as "a" or "an" (e.g., "a" and/or "an" should typically be interpreted to mean "at least one" or "one or more"); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even when a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of "two recitations," without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, and C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, and C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to "at least one of A, B, or C, etc." is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., "a system having at least one of A, B, or C" would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that typically a disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms unless context dictates otherwise. For example, the phrase "A or B" will be typically understood to include the possibilities of "A" or "B" or "A and B." With respect to the appended claims, those skilled in the art will appreciate that recited operations therein may generally be performed in any order. Also, although various operational flows are presented in a sequence(s), it should be understood that the various operations may be performed in other orders than those which are illustrated, or may be performed concurrently. Examples of such alternate orderings may include overlapping, interleaved, interrupted, reordered, incremental, preparatory, supplemental, simultaneous, reverse, or other variant orderings, unless context dictates otherwise. Furthermore, terms like "responsive to," "related to," or other past-tense adjectives are generally not intended to exclude such variants, unless context dictates otherwise. In summary, numerous benefits have been described which result from employing the concepts described herein. The foregoing description of the one or more embodiments has been presented for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or limiting to the precise form disclosed. Modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings.
