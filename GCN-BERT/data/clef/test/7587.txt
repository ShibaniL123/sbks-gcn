A cooled (0Â° C.) solution of crude 2-(8-cyclopentyl-2-((1-(methylsulfonyl)-piperidin-4-yl)amino)-7-oxo-7,8-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)acetamide (135D, 100 mg, 0.13 mmol) and triethylamine (67.7 mg, 0.67 mmol) in DCM (5 mL) was treated with trifluoroacetic acid anhydride (56.2 mg, 0.27 mmol). The cooling bath was removed and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The resulting yellow suspension was washed with deionized water (20 mL), then with sat. aq. NaCl. The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. This crude product was combined with that from another run (starting with 80 mg, 0.11 mmol, of 135D) for purification by preparative HPLC [column: DuraShell 150*25 mm*5 um; mobile phase: from 36% ACN in water (0.05% ammonium hydroxide v/v) to 56% ACN in H2O (0.05% ammonium hydroxide v/v)] to give (8-cyclopentyl-2-{[1-(methylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl]amino}-7-oxo-7,8-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)acetonitrile (Example 135, 27.1 mg, 26% yield for the combined batches) as a white solid.
