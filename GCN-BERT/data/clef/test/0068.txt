FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the field of exercise equipment, and particularly to an apparatus for operating in multiple modes of press exercises. BACKGROUND Many different types of exercise machines have been developed for strengthening a user's muscles. Multi-station, or so called “universal”, exercise machines are very popular for home use since many different exercises can be performed on a single apparatus. Machines of this type generally have a single weight slack that may be coupled to the various exercise stations by means of a cable/pulley system. SUMMARY An exercise device for providing exercise for a user may include a substantially vertical chimney frame member, a substantially horizontal chimney frame member connected to the substantially vertical chimney frame member, and a slack adjuster frame member to provide a plurality of exercise modes. The slack adjuster frame member may include a top slack adjuster frame member, and the slack adjuster frame member may include a bottom slack adjuster frame member. The plurality of operating modes may include at least one operating mode from the group of a bench press to perform bench press exercises, a decline press to perform decline press exercises, a preacher curls to perform preacher curls exercises, a military press to perform military press exercises, an incline press to perform incline press exercises and a bench press to perform bench press exercises. The plurality of modes may include a decline press mode to perform decline press exercises and the plurality of modes may include a preacher curls mode to perform preacher curls exercises. The plurality of modes may include a military press mode to perform military press exercises, and the plurality of modes may include an inclined press mode to perform inclined press exercises. The polarity of modes may include a bench press mode to perform bench press exercises.
