FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to a structure design and a synthetic method of cationic polymers useful as gene (DNA and RNA) carriers degradable to endogenous monomers and safety-known species. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It has been sufficiently evident that poly- or oligonucleotides of sensible (sense and/or antisense) sequences can be used as effective therapeutic agents in drug therapy, vaccination and tissue regeneration by turning the relevant gene on (expression) or off (silencing)[1]. To achieve such therapeutic efficacy, however, therapeutic genes, DNA vaccines as well as siRNA drugs must be delivered to the nuclei or cytoplasm of target cells. Among the carrier systems for delivering polynucleotides (also named as gene, gene materials, oligonucleotides, nucleic acids hereafter or DNA and RNA), synthetic delivery systems possess a series of advantages over viral vectors such as freedom from immunity and viral mutation, ability to package multiple genes or siRNA of choice into particulate vehicles via a single mechanism, and adaptability to simple and cost-efficient manufacturing process[2]. To deliver gene materials (DNA and RNA) to targeted inter- and intra-cellular sites effectively using non-viral systems, the synthetic gene carriers (i.e. non-viral vectors) must accomplish a number of tasks consequently comprising (A) packing gene materials to nano-particulate forms to avoid pre-phagocytosis degradation, (B) attaching on targeted cells selectively, (C) facilitating endosomal escape of gene materials, (D) releasing gene materials in cytoplasm, and (E) metabolizing itself to nontoxic species. There is yet, however, a synthetic gene delivery system reported to date meets all these criteria. Synthetic gene delivery vehicles reported in last decades can, in general, be divided into several categories, cationic liposome-based systems (called lipoplex), cationic polymer-based systems (called polyplex), lipid-cationic polymer combined systems (called lipopolyplex) and non-charged nanometer particulates. The majority of them are lipoplexes and polyplexes due to the negative charges of DNA and RNA by which the gene materials may easily be condensed into particles with positively charged liposomes or polymers. These two categories possess different advantages and mechanisms in terms of each step of gene transfection. Cationic liposomes condense gene materials less compactly than cationic polymers[3] but offer unique membrane fusion function with endosomes that may help DNA or RNA to escape to cytoplasm in molecular form[4]. Polycations (cationic polymer), on the other hand, may condense gene materials in more compacted forms[3] so that better protection and larger capacity of gene materials are expected[5]. For endosomal escaping, polyplex is believed to undergo a “proton sponging” process for which the polyplex-engulfing endosome is ruptured by chloride ions accumulated due to continuous influx pumping of HCl into endosomes to compensate the protons consumed by the cationic polymer carrier. In this case, the protonated polycation gains more positive charges to bind DNA or RNA due to which the gene materials enter cytoplasm in the form of particles rather than molecules. It has been reported that ruptured endosomes may be self-repaired so that the polyplex particle may be re-encapsulated before escaping[6]. In addition, the polynucleotides must be released or extracted out of the polyplex in order to exert their biological functions. It seems that condensation and release of DNA or RNA by polycations are a pair of contradictory processes which require a polycationic carrier system to be chemically dynamic and biologically responsive. To compromise gene packing and release, some researchers suggested to use or design a polycationic carrier which possesses a mild strength of gene condensation[7]. Using a cationic polymer with low molecular weight or with low amino group density is one of the approaches[8]. Another strategy is to use environment responsive polycations to achieve gene condensation and releasing, the two opposite moves, consequently[9]. This type of polymers are, however, often complex in structures and complicated in metabolic process and metabolized products. Using degradable cationic polymers as gene carriers may be a more reasonable approach by which gene release may be achieved by degradation of the backbone of the carriers, a process independent of its ability to condense DNA or RNA[10]. Degradation to small molecules will reduce chemical toxicity of polycations. As reported in the literature, biodegradable linkages such as carboxylic ester, phosphate ester, imine or disulfide structure were incorporated in the backbone of a cationic polymers. In this aspect, ester bond is the most widely used degradable structure to incorporate into the polycation backbone for its balanced stability and degradability. However, ester bond is highly reactive to nucleophiles such as primary and secondary amino groups[11], which are the key functional groups for gene compacting and proton sponging. In addition, degradation of ester structures creates acids that compromise the proton-sponging effect. Some researchers polymerized branched small molecular polyethylenimine (PEI) via an ester-bearing linker, and the cross-linked small molecular PEI carriers possess higher gene transfection efficiency but lower toxicity[14]. Backbone degradation of this polymer was achieved by cleavage of the linker, leaving the cleft fragments attached to the small molecular PEI or other amino group-bearing monomers (the polymer building blocks)[12-14]. Such a backbone degradation pattern may be fine for a polycationic gene carrier formed of man-made amino group-bearing building blocks. For a degradable cationic polymer formed of endogenous amino group-bearing monomers, the attachment of linker fragments upon polymer degradation will dismiss the advantages of using endogenous monomers. A polycationic gene carrier degradable to human endogenous amino group-bearing monomers is an ideal design to achieve intracellular release of genes and metabolic elimination of the carrier itself. WO2009/100,645 disclosed a method to develop polycationic gene carriers which possess sufficient amount of amino groups to condense polynucleotides into compacted particles and to induce endosomal break through proton sponge effect[15], and possess fully degradable backbone to release polynucleotides after endosomal escape and to turn itself to endogenous or non-toxic metabolites. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION As discussed above, a clinically useful delivery system should be capable to pack DNA or RNA of choice (single or multiple types) into nanoparticles with sufficient density, to target the polynucleotide-loading nanoparticles to diseased cells, to transport and release gene materials into cytoplasm of the cells, and finally, to degrade itself to nontoxic metabolites. For practical applications, the system should best be simple in structure, easy to prepare and formulate, and stable in storage, transportation and clinical operation. The above biological criteria may be translated into a series of required chemical properties of a synthetic polycationic carrier, comprising sufficient positive charges to pack negatively charged DNA or RNA, flexibility and easiness to conjugate or associate with targeting moieties to diseased cells, sufficient amount of low pKa (<8) amino groups as a pool for proton sponging, and degradability to non-toxic (preferably endogenous) monomers for intracellular release of polynucleotides, and ability to metabolize or be eliminated of their self. The present invention discloses a design of chemical structures of cationic polymers of which a monomers bearing sufficient number of amino groups are polymerized as the basic building blocks with a linker molecule possessing an aromatic ring through a degradable linkage. The amino group-bearing monomers are best to be those naturally existing (endogenous) in or nontoxic to the human body. In order to improve degradability or proton sponging effect, the linker molecules are best to be those which possess a heterocyclic ring containging nitrogen (or nitrogens) and a pKa not over 8. The linker molecule is best to link the amino group bearing monomers through conjugated imine structure. The imine linkage structure should be stable in a neutral environment (such as body fluid) but degradable responsively in an acidic environment (such as endosome or lyososome) and release the endogenous amino group-bearing monomer and the linker as their original states upon degradation. The responsively degradable linkage structures should also be best to conjugated π bonds so that it is sufficiently stable to prevent pre-cellular (pre-phagocytosis) degradation and dissociation of the polymer and the polyplex formed of the polymer and nucleic acids. Some examples for the endogenous amino group-bearing monomers are spermine and spermidine (or their derivatives), and examples of the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic linkers are imidazole-4,5-dialdehyde, imidazole-2,5-dialdehyde, pyrazole-3,4-dialdehyde, pyrazole-3,5-dialdehyde, pyridine substituted with two formic aldehydes, and pyrimidine substituted with two formic aldehydes. The said cationic polymers are chemically dynamic in order to degrade responsively to the pH differences along the delivery pathway from intercellular to cellular and from endosomes to lysosomes. To meet various delivery needs, chemical stability and pH responsibility may be adjusted by selecting linker molecules. For example, the poly-imine bonds formed with pyrazole-3,4-dialdehyde is more stable than that formed with imidazole-4,5-dialdehyde, and poly-imine bonds formed with pyridine or pyrimidine or benzene both substituted with two formic aldehydes are more stable than those formed with the other two linkers.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Effective gene delivery requires a delivery system to accomplish a series of biological functions comprising condensing genes into compacted particles, carrying genes into target cells, helping genes to escape endosomal degradation, releasing genes into cytoplasm, and degrading the delivery system into monomers non-toxic to and able to be eliminated from the body. To meet these requirements, a synthetic gene delivery system must possess respective functional groups to exert these biological functions. From practical aspects, such as synthesis, formulation and toxicity study, it is also important that such a multi-functional synthetic gene carrier must be structurally simple. One embodiment of the gene carrier system of the present invention consists of a type of cationic polymers of which endogenous amino group-bearing monomers, spermine and/or spermidine, are incorporated as the basic building block. Spermine or spermidine was polymerized with a linker molecule through a degradable linkage which is fairly stable in body fluid, but degrades in response to endosomal pH and release the endogenous amino group-earing monomer as its original state. One of the linkage structures able to meet such criteria is conjugated imine. For example, a bis-aldehyde possessing a conjugated π bond may be used as the linker by reacting with the primary amines of spermine or spoermidine to form polyspermine imines or polyspermidine imines. It will be even more super if the conjugated π structure of the linker possesses a pKa below 7 or 8 so that the endosomal pH will protonate the conjugated π bond and disrupt the linkage. A bis-aldehyde conjugated with an aromatic ring, especially a nitrogen-containing heterogeneous ring, is such an idea linker molecule. Gene materials (DNA or RNA) can be condensed into particles simply by mixing a solution of the nucleic acids with an aqueous solution of the cationic polymers at appropriate amino groups (from the polymer) to phosphate groups (from the nucleic acids) ratio. Gene transfection, anti-sense effect or RNA interferon effect can be achieved by adding this gene carrier suspension into cell medium. The polycations help polynucleotides to enter cells, escape from endosomes, and be released into cytoplasm. The cationic polymers possess great capability and convenience in condensing polynucleotides into nano-particulate simply by mixing them with selected therapeutic nucleic acids, large or small as well as single type or multiple types of genes. The poly-linked spermine or spermidine polymers may function as gene condenser, proton sponge, and responsive-release gene carrier. During the process exerting these functions, the polymers self-metabolize to non-toxic species. Another advantage of the linked spermine (or spermidine) polymers in addition to lowering toxicity is that their degradation does not generate acidic groups like other degradable polymers. Rather, their degradation generates free amino groups that help to further buffer the acidity inside endosomes and facilitate endosome rupture. Hiding the proton-absorbing amino groups in mine form helps to break endosome and release polynucleotides into cytoplasm without causing high Zeta potential, a key factor to shorten in vivo circulation time and interrupt inter-cellular targeting. For proton sponge effect, the endosome is broken by osmotic pressure generated by proton sponging effect (absorption of protons). Amino groups of the polycations are responsible for proton absorption. However, increase in amino group in cationic polymer (i.e. N/P ratio) will also lead to positive surface charges of polyplex which reduces circulation time of the polynucleotide-carrying particles in the body due to the negative charge of tissue surfaces. In the present invention, the nitrogen-containing linkages do not contribute to positive surface charge when it condenses with gene materials, but offer acid buffering effect when they degrade in endosomes and release free amino groups after being taken by cells. This nature helps the polynucleotide-carrying particles to achieve the same endosomal escape effect with lower surface charge and ensures better cell targeting. The present invention provides a cationic polymer comprising a plurality of amin-group-bearing monomers linked by linkers via cleavable and pH responsible bonds. The amino group bearing monomers may be human endogenous amines or their derivatives. In one embodiment of the invention, the amino group-bearing monomers are selected from spermine, spermidine and their combinations thereof. In one embodiment of the invention, the cleavable bonds can be cleaved to release said amino-group-bearing monomers. In another embodiment of the invention, the cleavable bonds are imines. In the above-mentioned cationic polymer, the linkage structure between repeating units of the polymers comprise amino groups with pKa<8. In one embodiment, these linkages are conjugated with an aromatic ring, especially a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring. This nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring is selected from imidazole, pyrazole, pyridine and pyrimidine. The poly-imine structures conjugated with these four types of heterocyclic ring possess different degradability and stability to meet the delivery needs. The spermine- (or spermidine-) containing polymer poly-linked with a conjugated an imidazole ring is more pH-responsible than the other three, and that poly-linked with a pyridine ring or a pyrimidine is more stable than the other two. The present invention also provides a method of synthesizing the above-mentioned cationic polymer, comprising a reaction between the amino group-bearing monomers and the linkers possessing two or three reactive groups, or a reaction between said amine monomers. The said reactive groups may be aldehydes. For example, the said cationic polymer may be formed by condensation reaction between spermine (or spermidine) and imidazole bis- (or di-) aldehyde, pyrazole bis- (or di-) aldehyde, pyridine bis- (or di-) aldehyde, pyrimidine bis- (or di-) aldehyde, or phthalic aldehydes. However, condensation between spermine or spermidine and bis- (or di-) aldehyde is not the sole approach to synthesize the claimed cationic polymer based on a poly-imine structure involving a comjugated aromatic ring, especially a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring. The present invention further teaches a use of the cationic polymer to encapsulate and deliver a DNA or RNA into polyplexes (nano-particulates). The amino group-bearing monomers (i.e. the basic building blocks) can be selected from any molecules possessing at least two primary amino groups. Some good examples are spermine and spermidine, two endogenous amino group-bearing molecules condensing with nucleotides in sperms. The linker molecules are those possessing a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring and at least two functional groups able to form imine (>C═N—) structures with the primary amino groups of the building blocks. Some examples of the linker molecules are imidazole-4,5-bisaldehyde, imidazole-2,5-bisaldehyde, pyrazole-3,4-bisaldehyde, pyrazole-3,5-bisaldehyde, pyridine substituted with two formic aldehydes, pyrimidine substituted with two formic aldehydes, and phthalic aldehydes. When these two amino group-bearing building blocks and the four heterocyclic linkers are paired one by one and allowed to polymerize, eight (8) ABABAB . . . types of polymers may be formed. FIGS. 1, 2, 3 and 4 show the molecular structures of these polymers formed through the four linkers, respectively. The reaction schemes for forming these polymers from the paired building blocks and the linkers are depicted in FIGS. 5, 6, 7 and 8. Since each of the amino group-bearing monomer (spermine or spermidine) possesses two primary amino groups and each of the linker (imidazole-4,5-bisaldhyde, imidazole-2,5-bisaldehyde, pyrazole-3,4-bisaldehyde, pyrazole-3,5-bisaldehyde, pyridine substituted with two formic aldehydes, pyrimidine substituted with two formic aldehydes, or phthalic aldehydes) possesses two aldehyde groups, one-by-one pairing between the building blocks and the linkers will lead to linear polymers. For those amino group-bearing monomers and aldehyde-possessing linkers which have more than two functional groups, branched polymers may be formed. Also, as long as the conjugate π bond structures of the heterocyclic linkers remain, substitution of the available ═CH— site and the >N—H site of the rings is acceptable (for forming the polymers). The most unique characteristics of the above-described polymers are their degradability responded to endosomal pH as well as the pattern of the degradation products which are endogenous monomers and safety-known monomers. The nitrogen-containing heterocyclic linkage structures have the capability to absorb protons; consequently, their conjugate π bond system will be interrupted and the polymeric linkages become unstable. This nature enables the above-described polymers to respond to the low pH environment of endosomes and lysosomes of cells which engulfing the nanoparticulate (celled polyplex), and readily degrade. The each linkage of the polymers being engulfed (with the polyplex) will absorb proton pumped into endosomes to degrade, and release two more free amino groups which absorb two more protons. Absorption of protons in endosomes or lysosomes is called “proton sponging” effect, a known mechanism to rupture these intracellular vesicles and release polynucleotides into the cytoplasm of cells. This invention also provides a method of synthesizing a cationic polymer, comprising a reaction between an amino group-bearing monomer and a linker possessing two or more reactive groups. In one embodiment, the reactive groups are aldehydes. This invention also provides a method to encapsulate and deliver a DNA or RNA, or to assemble lipid bilayers around polypex through intermolecular interactions. Examples Following examples are aimed to help technologists of related disciplines to better understand this invention. The examples should not be used to limit the applications and rights of this invention. Example 1 Synthesis of Polyspermine Imidazole-4,5-Imine (See FIG. 8A) In a three-necked flask (250 ml) equipped with a dropping funnel, 1.05 equivalent spermine was dissolved in anhydrous DMF (5 ml), to which 0.00625 equivalent p-Toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate and a small amount of freshly activated molecular sieves of type 4A were added at room temperature under a high-purity nitrogen atmosphere. 1.0 equivalent 1H-Imidazole-4,5-dicarboxaldehyde dissolved in anhydrous DMF (5 ml) was added dropwise to the mixture slowly over 4 hours, and heated quickly to 80° C. After stirring for another 24 hours, the solution was filtrated in vacuum and evaporated to remove the solvent. The viscous residue was dissolved again in water and dialyzed through a cellulose membrane of molecular weight cutoff of 10000 for 24 hours to remove the small fragments. The dialysate was stored at −80° C. for 4 hours and then freeze-dried over 24 hours to obtain water-soluble yellowish products as solid. Example 2 Structural Characterization of Polyspermine Imidazole-4,5-Imine 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectrum of polyspermine imidazole-4,5-imine was dissolved in DMSO-d6 with 0.03% (v/v) tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. Results of the measurement were shown in FIG. 15; FT-IR spectrum of polyspermine imidazole-4,5-imine compressed with KBr into a disk was recorded using a Bruker Optics FT-IR spectrometer. A spectrum recorded in the range of 400-4000 cm−1, at resolution of 4 cm−1 for 16 scans accumulation is shown in FIG. 16. Molecular weight of obtained polyspermine imidazole-4,5-imine was determined using an Agilent 1260 Infinity equipped with a size exclusion chromatography (SEC-HPLC) column, a diode array detector (DAD), and refractive index detector (RID). PEG of known molecular weight was used as the standard. FIG. 17 summarize the SEC-HPLC charts of the measurements. Example 3 Degradation of Polyspermine Imidazole-4,5-Imine Under Various pH Polyspermine imidazole-4,5-imine was dissolved in formic buffers to concentration of 2.0 mg/ml under pH 7.4, 5.8 and 5.0, the simulates of body fluid, endosomes and lysosomes. The polymers to be characterized (for molecular weight) were incubated under the respective pH at 37° C., and sampled for SEC-HPLC measurement. The degradation rates of the polymers were determined by the molecular weight changes measured by SEC-HPLC (relative to PEG standard). As shown in FIG. 18, degradation rates of polyspermine imidazole-4,5-imine under the three various pH were remarkably different from each other. The time for the polymer to drop their molecular weight to the half of the original under pH 7.4, 5.8 and 5.0 were 48, 21, and 1 hours, respectively (See the insert of FIG. 18). Example 4 Preparation and Characterization of Polyplexes Formed of Polyspermine Imidazole-4,5-Imine and Luciferase pGL3-Control Plasmid Polyplexes were formed by mixing polyspermine imidazole-4,5-imine into pDNA solution at various polymer to gene ratio (W/W), followed 30 min maturing at room temperature. The formed polyplexes were loaded on a 1.0% agarose gel in 1× Tris-Acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide with 6× loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis for 45 mins at 110 V. The retardation of pDNA electrophoresis was visualized using a UV illuminator. As shown in FIG. 19, the electrophoresis of pDNA was completely retarded when the polymer to gene ratio (W/W) reached 3 or over. The particle size and Zeta potential of the polyplexes at various polymer to gene ratios were measured in water and HEPES buffer (pH 7.0; 0.05 M) using a Brookhaven Particle Size Analyzer (90 Plus). The mean values of particle sizes and Zeta potential (±standard deviations) shown in FIG. 20 were calculated from three experiments. Morphology of the polyplexes formed at polymer to gene ratio of 2 was imaged using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM, Nanoscope IIIa AFM system, Veeco, USA) and shown in FIG. 21. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images of the same polyplexes were taken using an JEM 2010 system (JEOL, Japan) and shown in FIG. 22. The polyplex sizes measured using the two methods are comparable (around 100-200 nm). Example 5 Transfection Efficiency of Polyplexes Formed of Polyspermine Imidazole-4,5-Imine and Luciferase pGL3-Control Plasmid COS-7 cells, HepG2 cells, and MCF-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. For gene transfection, COS-7 cells, HepG2 cells, and MCF-7 cells were seeded in a 48-well plate at a density of 5×104 cells per well to reach about 90% confluent at the time of transfection and incubated for 24 hours. pDNA (500 ng) was added in a polyspermine imidazole-4,5-imine solution at various W/W ratios of polymer to gene to form polyplexes. PEI 25 KDa and Lipofectamine 2000 were used as references at W/W ratio of 2 and 1, respectively. The carrier-gene complexes were incubated with the cells in the OPTIMEM I medium (Invitrogen) for 4 hours. The transfection medium was then replaced by fresh medium and incubated for additional 48 hours. Finally, the transfected cells were washed with PBS solution and lysed with 1× cell lysis buffer (Promega), followed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 3 mins. To determine gene expression activity, 20 μl supernatant was mixed with 20 μl substrate (Luciferase Assay System, Promega) and its luminescence was measured using a single tube luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems). Gene transfection activity of polyspermine imidazole-4,5-imine and the two references was defined as the luminescence per unit protein whose amount was determined using Micro BCA™ Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific Pierce). To cancel the variation due to cell conditions, relative expression activity (with that of PEI-25 KD as 100%) are shown in FIG. 23. Example 6 Cytotoxicity of Polyspermine Imidazole-4,5-Imine and Polyplexes Formed of Polyspermine Imidazole-4,5-Imine and siRNA Cytotoxicity of polyspermine imidazole-4,5-imine in comparison with PEI 25 KDa was evaluated by percent viability of variety of cell lines, comprising COS-7, is SMMC-7721 cells stably expressing the GL3 luciferase gene, HepG2, MCF-7, and BRL-3A cells. For MTT assay, COS-7 cells, SMMC-7721 cells, HepG2 cells, MCF-7 cells, and BRL-3A cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1×104 cells per well and incubated for 24 hours, followed by the treatment with the polymer solutions of desired concentrations or the polyplexes/lipoplexes formed of carrier and siRNA. After additional 4 hours incubation, the plate was replaced by 112.5 μl fresh culture medium, and 12.5 μl MTT solution at the concentration of 5 mg/ml in PBS buffer was added into the cells for 6 hours. Viable cells were determined by measuring the absorbance of the samples at 570 nm (with 630 nm as the reference) using a SpectraMax M3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader. Cell viabilities were calculated by comparison of the non-treated cells (normal cells) as 100%. The data were expressed as mean values (±standard deviations) of six experiments. Results of the experiments were shown in FIG. 24-25. For direct observation of cell growth states, COS-7 cells and SMMC-7721 cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at a density of 2×105 cells per well and incubated for 24 hours, followed by the treatment with the polymer solutions of desired concentrations. After additional 4 hours incubation, the plate was replaced by fresh culture medium and incubated for another 6 hours. The cell growth states were observed and recorded directly under a microscope. Results of the experiments were shown in FIG. 26.

To determine the extent of luciferase gene knockdown, the transfected cells were washed with PBS solution and lysed with 1× cell lysis buffer followed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 3 min. 20 μl supernatant was mixed with 20 μl substrate and the luminescence was measured by a single tube luminometer. The protein concentrations of the samples were determined by Micro BCA™ Protein Assay Kit. Luciferase activity of a sample was expressed as percent luminescence intensity compared to the untreated control normalized on protein concentration. The data were expressed as mean values (±standard deviations) of three experiments. Results of the measurements were shown in FIG. 32. Example 9 Gene Silencing Activity of Polyplexes Formed of Polyspermine Imidazole-4,5-Imine and Luciferase pGL3-Control siRNA in Vivo Male BALB/c-nu mice aged 6 weeks were inoculated subcutaneously in the nape of the neck with 2×106 SMMC-7721 cells stably expressing the GL3 luciferase gene. All animal experiments were performed when the tumor reached 200-250 mm3. Three weeks later, mice were given locally injections of polyplexes formed of polyspermine imidazole-4,5-imine and siRNA (10 μg) at W/W ratio of 25 formulated in 200 μl PBS buffer, naked siRNA (10 μg) formulated in 200 μl PBS buffer and 200 μl saline was injected as control. After 48 hours, the mice were euthanized and the tumors were taken out, washed with cold saline and collected. The tumors were ground in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 1 ml 5× cell lysis buffer, followed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 3 min. 20 μl supernatant was mixed with 20 μl substrate and the luminescence was measured by a single tube luminometer. The protein concentrations of the samples were determined by a protein assay kit. Luciferase activity of a sample was normalized with the protein content and expressed as percent luminescence intensity compared to the untreated control.
