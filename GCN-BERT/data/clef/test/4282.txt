It has also been discovered by the inventors that blue light with a peak wavelength of about 410-490 nm and a bandwidth of about 15-25 nm can photoactivate green, yellow and orange dyes in an optical medium on or near the tissues causing them to fluoresce. According to Stokes’ shift the emitted fluorescent light has a longer peak wavelength than the activating light, the longer wavelengths having deeper tissue penetration. The emitted fluorescent light can be multi-colour bandwidth which is thought to enhance its potentially therapeutic effect. Therefore, it is believed that the emitted fluorescent light also has a therapeutic effect on tissues which it irradiates, and which is complementary to the therapeutic effect of the light emitted from the light source. In the presence of oxygen, the photoactivation may also generate reactive oxygen species at levels having a therapeutic effect.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION To provide an understanding of the devices, lamps, systems and methods described herein, certain illustrative embodiments will now be described. For the purpose of clarity and illustration, the embodiments are described primarily with respect to light emitting diode (LED) light sources. Elowever, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that other light sources may also be used in the devices, lamps, systems and methods described herein, which may be adapted and modified as appropriate. Such other additions and modifications will not depart from the scope hereof. According to a first broad aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a device 100 for emitting light, the device 100 is a lamp comprising: a first light source and a second light source. Specifically, the first light source, which in one embodiment is a set of first LEDs 102, has an emission spectra which can induce a therapeutic effect on a treatment site or area irradiated with the light source. The therapeutic effect can include an antimicrobial effect and/or a stimulatory effect such as initially increasing blood flow at the treatment site, followed by a reduction in inflammation and collagen production. The second light source, which in one embodiment is a set of second LEDs 104, has an emission spectra which can activate a photoactivatable composition applied on or located near the treatment site, or which may have an effect on local blood flow modulation or collagen remodeling. The photoactivatable composition generally includes a photoactive agent which when activated can provide a therapeutic effect on the treatment area either by emission of fluorescent light at therapeutic wavelengths and at therapeutic intensities, by emission of energy which can then activate further photoactive agents in the compositions or the treatment site to have a therapeutic effect, and/or by excitation of its molecules to an excited singlet state which can then react with other molecules to produce for example reactive oxygen species. It is believed that low levels of reactive oxygen species can have a therapeutic effect on tissues. Examples of photoactivatable compositions are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0128132, filed on Nov. 9, 2006, PCT Publication No. WO/2010/051636, filed on Nov. 6, 2009, PCT Publication No. WO/2010/051641, filed on Nov. 6, 2009, and PCT Application No. PCT/CA/2010/001134, filed on Jul. 19, 2010, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. Alternatively, both the light sources can emit light having an emission spectra suitable for activating a photoactivatable composition including one or more photoactive agents. In this way, a broad bandwidth activating energy can be provided to a photoactive agent which can more efficiently photoactivate the photoactivate agent. In the case where there is more than one photoactive agent having different absorption profiles, providing at least two light sources can photoactivate both these agents. Furthermore, some photoactive agents include can have a plurality of peak wavelengths in their absorption spectra. Therefore, the provision of two or more light sources can fully activate the photoactive agent across its entire absorption spectrum in order to benefit from its photoactivated properties. The first and second sets of LEDs 102, 104 can provide a complementary phototherapeutic treatment to the treatment site, whereby the therapeutic effect of the first set of LEDs 102 is augmented and complemented by the therapeutic effect of the second set of LEDs 104 through, for example, activation of a photoactivatable and therapeutic composition. In some embodiments, a fluorescence emitted by such a photoactivatable composition has a power density at the skin surface of less than about 75 mW/cm2, less than about 50 mW/cm2, less than about 10 mW/cm2, less than about 5 mW/cm2, less than about 2.5 mW/cm2, or less than about 2 mW/cm2. The maximum power density can be from about 0.02 mW/cm2 to about 75 mW/cm2, from about 0.02 mW/cm2 to about 50 mW/cm2, from about 0.02 mW/cm2 to about 10 mW/cm2, from about 0.02 mW/cm2 to about 5 mW/cm2, or from about 0.02 mW/cm2 to about 10 mW/cm2. Referring now to an embodiment of the device 100 illustrated in FIG. 1, where the first and second set of LEDs 102, 104 are housed in a head 106 of the device which is adjustably attached to a body 108 having a base 110. Locking mechanism(s) can be provided for locking the position of the head, base or body. The LEDs are mounted on a panel (not shown) within the housing as an array and emit light from an emitting surface 112 of the head 106. The device 100 may include lockable wheels at the base (not shown) such that a user may freely move the device to a desired location and lock the device’s position. Optionally, depending on the power of the LEDs used and the treatment time, in order to minimize heating, the head 100 may include one or more cooling systems (not shown) for cooling the first and/or the second set of LEDs such as heat sinks, one or more fans (not shown), vents in the lamp housing, liquid cooling device, and the like. The cooling system may also comprise a shield for absorbing heat. The device also includes a controller 114 in electronic communication with the LEDs for controlling various parameters of the emitted light such as power on/power off to individual LEDs within a set as well as to the different LED sets. Other parameters which may be controlled by the controller are: the maximum emitted power density of light from each LED, the bandwidth, the peak wavelength of emission, duration of light emission, variation of emitted light power density as a function of light emission time, variation of wavelength as a function of light emission time. This can allow a device operator to tailor the phototherapeutic treatment of each subject according to the therapy required. The head 106 may be removable from the rest of the device 100 and replaceable. In certain embodiments, the lamp includes rotation device(s) (not shown) that allows for the head 106 to face any direction at any angle for convenience, and to be locked in that position. In certain embodiments, the lamp head (106) may be removable from the rest of the device in order to be used as a portable hand-held lamp. In this case, the lamp head may include one or more components of the controller and optionally a power source. In certain embodiments, there is provided a spacing probe (not shown) extending on the lamp head 106 for spacing the emitting face 112 from the treatment site. This can ensure the delivery of the appropriate light dose which is a function of distance. The spacing probe may be a measuring device such a ruler having an appropriate length, or may comprise a sensor system for detecting the distance using sound or light. In certain embodiments, there is also provided a work surface, such as a tray, a basket or a net, removably attached to the body of the device 108. An exemplary physical spatial arrangement of the array of the first and second sets of LEDs 102, 104 are illustrated in FIG. 2. The array comprises 40 LEDs arranged in 8 rows and 5 columns with 6 LEDs in the first set and 34 LEDs in the second set. It will be understood by a skilled person that any other number of LEDs with any other array configuration is also possible. In another embodiment, the LED array comprises a total of at least 36 LEDs, at least 40 LEDS, at least 46 LEDs or at least 184 LEDs, mounted on the panel. In one embodiment, the LED array comprises 184 LEDs arranged as 8 rows and 23 columns. In yet another embodiment, the LED array comprises 36 LEDs comprising 6 rows by 6 columns. It will be appreciated by the skilled man that the LED array can be arranged in any configuration and can be any size or shape such as rectangular, circular or any other shape. The panel surface may be graduated so that some of the LEDs are closer to the treatment site than others. For example, may be a rectangular panel comprising the second set of LEDs on a first surface, and the first set of LEDs being mounted around the periphery of the first surface and spaced from the first surface. In the embodiment of FIG. 2, the first and second sets of LEDs have a different peak emitted wavelength from one another. The first set of LEDs has a peak wavelength of about 410 nm to about 420 nm and a bandwidth of about 13-15nm, which may have an antibacterial effect against certain bacteria such as p.acnes, and the second set of LEDs has a peak wavelength of about 440 nm to about 470 nm and a bandwidth of about 20 nm ± 2nm. FIG. 3 is an exemplary emission spectra of this embodiment of the device measured at 5cm, as measured using a SP-100 spectroradiometer (SP-100, ORB Optronix) to measure the power density spectra versus wavelength Typically, the total emitted power density obtained at a distance of 5 cm with this embodiment of the device is about 60 to 150 mW/cm2 with a total energy emitted over 5 minutes of about 20 to 50 J/cm2. In a different embodiment (not shown), the LEDs are mounted on a flexible substrate which may form part of, or be included with, a dressing, a mask, or any other material which can be applied to skin, hair, nails or other tissues. The device head 106 may comprise a plurality of connectable panels (not shown) having LEDs mounted thereon. There may be any number of panels connectable together, such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7. The panels can be connected together such that their emitting surfaces 112 are angled with respect to one another. In this way, it may be possible to radiate light to different sides of a curved or irregular treatment site of a subject such as face, arms, or legs. The size and shape of the panel will depend on the area to be treated. For example, for treatment of the face, a single curved panel, or a number of joined panels with a curvature can be used. The panels can be moveably connected to one another. A locking mechanism may be provided for fixing the panels in a desired position. The LED array may also include a third set of LEDs that emits light at a different peak wavelength or power density or bandwidth than the first and/or second set of LEDs. In some embodiments, the third set of LEDs emits light in the red portion of the visible electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., between 630 nm and 700 nm). In other embodiments, the third set of LEDs emits light in the orange portion of the visible electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., between 635 nm and 590 nm). In yet other embodiments, the third set of LEDs emits light in a yellow portion of the visible electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., between 590 nm and 560 nm). In other embodiments, the third set of light generating sources emits light in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., between 800 nm and 1000 nm). Alternative embodiments include LEDs that emit light of different wavelengths and power intensities than those described above, and which have different therapeutic effects. Further exemplary arrays of the first and second sets of LEDs 102, 104 are illustrated in FIGS. 4a to 4d. The LEDs of the second set of LEDs are interdispersed amongst the LEDs of the first set of LEDs. Different numbers and ratios of the number of LEDs in each of the first and second set of LEDs are possible. As the power density which can be emitted by different LEDS can vary, the ratio can also be defined in terms of a power density ratio of the first and second set of LEDs. The number or the power density ratio can be tailored according to the therapeutic effect desired using the device 100. For example, for an infected skin condition, the relative power which can be emitted by the first LED set can be increased, whereas for a cosmetic treatment the relative power which can be emitted by the second LED set may be increased. In certain embodiments, the LEDs are equally spaced apart. The distance between the LEDs on the panel may be any distance such as about 4 to 7 mm, about 4 to 10 mm, about 10 to 15 mm, or about 15 to 20 mm apart from one another. In certain embodiments, the LEDs are spaced apart by about 10-12 mm in one direction and about 13-18 mm in another direction. The LEDs may be more closely arranged if a higher power is required from the device 100. In certain other embodiments, the LEDs are not equally spaced apart. Optionally, the device 100 may include a removable mask (cover) to reduce the size of the emitting area of the head 100. The device may be configured to deliver light with substantially equal distribution across an exposed surface with or without use of the mask. The head may have a U-shape, a circular shape, or any other suitable shape for a lamp head. The device 100 may also include filters to filter the light emitted from the emitting surface 112 in order to emit light of an appropriate wavelength, bandwidth or power density. The filters may include a UV filter, a collimator, a reflector or any other means for shaping the light from the device 100. FIG. 5 is an emission spectra of a different embodiment of the device, measured in the same manner as FIG. 3, which differs from the embodiment described above in that the second set of LEDs has a higher peak wavelength, of 450 to about 480 nm, and the head comprises three panels which are positioned to wrap around a part or a whole of a contoured body part such as the face, arms, legs. In this embodiment, the average power density at a treatment distance is less than about 75 mW/cm2, or about 30 to 150 mW/cm2. In another embodiment of the device, the peak wavelength of the light from the first light source is about 430 to about 500 nm, about 440 to about 500 nm, about 450 to about 500 nm, about 430 to about 475 nm, about 435 nm to about 470 nm, about 440 nm to about 460 nm, about 445 nm to about 455 nm, about 440 nm, about 450 nm, about 460 nm or about 470 nm. The peak wavelength of the light from the second light source may be about 400 nm to about 500 nm, about 400 nm to about 475 nm, about 400 nm to about 450 nm, about 400 nm to about 430 nm, about 410 nm to about 420 nm, or about 415 nm. Alternatively, the second peak wavelength may be about 480 to about 760 nm, about 480 nm to about 700 nm, about 480 nm to about 650 nm, about 480 nm to about 620 nm, about 500 to about 700 nm, about 520 nm to about 700nm, about 500 nm to about 660 nm, about 540 nm to about 640 nm, about 540 nm to about 580 nm, about 500 nm to about 570 nm, about 570 nm to about 590 nm, about 590 nm to about 610 nm, or about 610 nm to about 760 nm. In certain embodiments, light from the second light source has a broader bandwidth than the light from the first light source, and a lower average power. Another embodiment of the device differs from those above in that instead of the first and second light sources emitting light having different peak wavelengths, there is provided at least one light source which emits a light, such as white light, which is transformed to the required spectra by one or more filters. The at least one light source is an array of LEDs or other light sources emitting white light. The filters comprise coloured transparent sheets, such as those used in stage lighting, which can remove the unwanted light allowing only the beneficial light to pass therethrough to a treatment site. In another embodiment, the filter may incorporate a fluorescent agent. The light emitting surface of the device may comprise one or more waveguides such as a fibre optic, or a bundle of fibre optics connectable to the one or more light sources. The fibre optics may be made of any material with suitable light carrying and tensile properties, such as polymethylmethacrylate (ΡΜΜΑ). The fibre optic(s) may be encased in a sleeve. The fibre optics can thus be used to deliver the therapeutic light from the device to an internal cavity of a subject or a hard to reach treatment area on the subject. Referring now to the controller 114, by means of the controller, different treatment parameters can be pre-set as a treatment mode, or can be customized by the device operator. For example, the controller 114 may allow the user to select specific peak wavelengths, such as red, yellow, blue and/or infrared wavelengths, or a combination thereof to treat various conditions, such as skin conditions or wounds. Additional light color types may also be used. In this case, the device includes different sets of LEDs per desired peak wavelength. The controller 114 may optionally include a display (not shown) that assists a user in selecting and controlling treatment modes, timers, and other functionality features. The controller 114 can illuminate different sets of LEDs, or other light sources, having different emission spectra such as peak wavelengths simultaneously or at separate times. It may be desirable to activate the different light sources simultaneously such that the effects of irradiation by the different light sources take place simultaneously. In addition, the combination of the two or more emission spectra may introduce a synergistic effect which may result in more efficient treatment than the single application of either emission spectra at a time. Alternatively, it may be desirable to activate one emission spectra at a time. Operating a phototherapeutic lamp within a single emission spectra may be desirable if no synergistic effects are expected from operating at multiple emission spectra simultaneously, or if it is determined that doing so has a detrimental effect. It may also be desirable to alternate between two or more emission spectra. For example, in weekly treatments for acne, alternating between two wavelength ranges (e.g., 633 nm (red) and 415 nm (violet)) may result in more efficient treatment than using one wavelength range alone. Treatment modes may be stored on a memory device or database in a machine readable form as described in relation to the device in FIG. 6. For example, a user may select one or more of a list of skin conditions or medical conditions to be treated. With treatment modes stored on a memory device or database, the lamp controller can access operating parameters of the phototherapeutic lamp that correspond with a particular light therapy treatment. Such parameters may include a dosage as defined by a treatment time, an average power, a treatment distance, a peak wavelength and a bandwidth, and may be inputted by a manufacturer or programmer of the device, or alternatively a user may provide adjustment operating parameter in accordance with a customized phototherapeutic treatment program. The circuitry in the device may include a switch to select a mode of operation. The switch may be implemented in hardware, software, firmware, or a combination thereof. Different modes of operation may specify various parameters of the generated light, such as the wavelength range, bandwidth, peak wavelength, or any other light source parameter. In addition, a light source may be configured to produce pulses of light. In pulsating light sources, stronger intensities may be used to deliver a same amount of energy in a same amount of time as a non-pulsating light source. Pulsating may therefore be desirable for delivering stronger intensity light for a short amount of time and may accelerate the efficiency of a treatment. In this case, different modes may include different pulsation parameters, such as the pulse duration, the pulse frequency, the pulse intensity, the number of pulses, or any other pulsation parameter. In some cases, it may be desirable to keep the pulse parameters constant throughout a treatment session, such that the same pulse is delivered repeatedly. In other cases, it may be desirable to vary one or more pulse parameters over time across multiple pulses within the same session. For example, it may be desirable to operate in a mode where the pulse intensity increases with each pulse. In another example, it may be desirable to alternate between two or more wavelength ranges with each pulse. The parameters of the generated light (non-pulsating or pulsating) may be adjusted for any number of paradigms. Different modes of operation may also include illuminating different sets of the light sources, such as the LEDs, at different times. For example, only one of the LED sets may be illuminated in a mode, or a selected number of the LEDs within a set. This may be desired if the area requiring treatment (e.g., a wound) is small such that illuminating all the LEDs would treat a larger region than required. As an example, it may be desirable to treat an area of skin near the eye, but delivering light to the eye may cause damage. In this case, using a subset of the light generating sources is useful to appropriately control the size and shape of the region to be treated. In another example, when a mode includes using pulses, two subsets of the light generating sources may alternately pulse on and off such that only one subset of sources is illuminated at any given time. This mode may be selected when it is desirable to deliver a transient light with strong intensity to a subset of locations. The device operator may directly select a mode of operation, or the device may include a user interface that allows the user to select one or more goals, and the device may be configured to select an appropriate mode based on the user’s selection. For example, the device operator may indicate at the user interface that it is desirable to use a mode for treating acne, and an appropriate mode may be selected, such as a non-pulsating emission with a first emitted maximum peak of about 400 nm to about 430 nm at a full width half maximum bandwidth of about 14 nm, and a second maximum peak of about 440 to about 470nm, or any other suitable mode for treating acne. The modes selected by the circuitry of the device or by the operator may be appropriately adjusted to be within levels that are safe and comply with regulatory requirements in any country. In certain embodiments, the device includes a sensor in communication with the controller and feedback mechanism such that device output is related to various parameters that the sensor detects. The sensor may be an optical, thermal or biometric sensor or the like. For example, if a thermal sensor senses that a pre-set temperature on or near the treatment site has been reached or is close to being reached, the device will adjust the emitted light parameters accordingly, for example by (i) lowering the power density and extending the treatment time extended to deliver the same dosage, (ii) reducing the dosage is reduced, (iii) turning the device off, (iv) activating an alarm, (ν) activating the cooling system, if present, to cool around or within the treatment area, or (vi) adjusting an output of the cooling system, if present, e.g. rate of cooling or extent of cooling. The sensor may be an optical sensor for detecting a light output from a photoactivatable composition which the device is irradiating, and in response to a detected emitted light, the device can, for example (i) turn off the lamp when the photoactivatable composition is spent (photobleached), (ii) adjust the emission spectra of the light irradiating the composition to account for variability of distance of the device from the composition or composition thickness. This can be considered a self-tuning mechanism to adapt the characteristics of the lamp based on the emission of the photoactivated composition. In certain embodiments, the sensor is used to pair the photoactivatable composition to the device. For example, such that the lamp is enabled only when it sees a specific optical signature from the photoactivatable composition, or when it sees a specific bar code from a container of the composition. This can also be considered as a safety feature. FIG. 6 is a block diagram of a computing device, which may be included in the device, for performing any of the processes described herein. Each of the components of these systems may be implemented on one or more computing devices 400. In certain aspects, a plurality of the components of these systems may be included within one computing device 400. In certain implementations, a component and a storage device may be implemented across several computing devices 400. The computing device 400 comprises at least one communications interface unit, an input/output controller 410, system memory, and one or more data storage devices. The system memory includes at least one random access memory (RAM 402) and at least one read-only memory (ROM 404). All of these elements are in communication with a central processing unit (CPU 406) to facilitate the operation of the computing device 400. The computing device 400 may be configured in many different ways. For example, the computing device 400 may be a conventional standalone computer or alternatively, the functions of computing device 400 may be distributed across multiple computer systems and architectures. In FIG.S 4a to 4d, the computing device 400 is linked, via network or local network, to other servers or systems. The computing device 400 may be configured in a distributed architecture, wherein databases and processors are housed in separate units or locations. Some units perform primary processing functions and contain at a minimum a general controller or a processor and a system memory. In distributed architecture implementations, each of these units may be attached via the communications interface unit 408 to a communications hub or port (not shown) that serves as a primary communication link with other servers, client or user computers and other related devices. The communications hub or port may have minimal processing capability itself, serving primarily as a communications router. A variety of communications protocols may be part of the system, including, but not limited to: Ethernet, SAP, SAS™, ATP, BLUETOOTH™, GSM and TCP/IP. The CPU 406 comprises a processor, such as one or more conventional microprocessors and one or more supplementary co-processors such as math co-processors for offloading workload from the CPU 406. The CPU 406 is in communication with the communications interface unit 408 and the input/output controller 410, through which the CPU 406 communicates with other devices such as other servers, user terminals, or devices. The communications interface unit 408 and the input/output controller 410 may include multiple communication channels for simultaneous communication with, for example, other processors, servers or client terminals. The CPU 406 is also in communication with the data storage device. The data storage device may comprise an appropriate combination of magnetic, optical or semiconductor memory, and may include, for example, RAM 402, ROM 404, flash drive, an optical disc such as a compact disc or a hard disk or drive. The CPU 406 and the data storage device each may be, for example, located entirely within a single computer or other computing device; or connected to each other by a communication medium, such as a USB port, serial port cable, a coaxial cable, an Ethernet cable, a telephone line, a radio frequency transceiver or other similar wireless or wired medium or combination of the foregoing. For example, the CPU 406 may be connected to the data storage device via the communications interface unit 408. The CPU 406 may be configured to perform one or more particular processing functions. The data storage device may store, for example, (i) an operating system 412 for the computing device 400; (ii) one or more applications 414 (e.g., computer program code or a computer program product) adapted to direct the CPU 406 in accordance with the systems and methods described here, and particularly in accordance with the processes described in detail with regard to the CPU 406; or (iii) database(s) 416 adapted to store information that may be utilized to store information required by the program. The operating system 412 and applications 414 may be stored, for example, in a compressed, an uncompiled and an encrypted format, and may include computer program code. The instructions of the program may be read into a main memory of the processor from a computer-readable medium other than the data storage device, such as from the ROM 404 or from the RAM 402. While execution of sequences of instructions in the program causes the CPU 406 to perform the process steps described herein, hard-wired circuitry may be used in place of, or in combination with, software instructions for implementation of the processes of the present disclosure. Thus, the systems and methods described are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software. Suitable computer program code may be provided for performing one or more functions in relation to selecting a mode of operation as described herein. The program also may include program elements such as an operating system 412, a database management system and "device drivers" that allow the processor to interface with computer peripheral devices (e.g., a video display, a keyboard, a computer mouse, etc.) via the input/output controller 410. The term "computer-readable medium" as used herein refers to any non-transitory medium that provides or participates in providing instructions to the processor of the computing device 400 (or any other processor of a device described herein) for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, non-volatile media and volatile media. Non-volatile media include, for example, optical, magnetic, or opto-magnetic disks, or integrated circuit memory, such as flash memory. Volatile media include dynamic random access memory (DRAM), which typically constitutes the main memory. Common forms of computer-readable media include, for example, a floppy disk, a flexible disk, hard disk, magnetic tape, any other magnetic medium, a CD-ROM, DVD, any other optical medium, punch cards, paper tape, any other physical medium with patterns of holes, a RAM, a PROM, an EPROM or EEPROM (electronically erasable programmable read-only memory), a FLASH-EEPROM, any other memory chip or cartridge, or any other non-transitory medium from which a computer can read. Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequences of one or more instructions to the CPU 406 (or any other processor of a device described herein) for execution. For example, the instructions may initially be borne on a magnetic disk of a remote computer (not shown). The remote computer can load the instructions into its dynamic memory and send the instructions over an Ethernet connection, cable line, or even telephone line using a modem. A communications device local to a computing device 400 (e.g., a server) can receive the data on the respective communications line and place the data on a system bus for the processor. The system bus carries the data to main memory, from which the processor retrieves and executes the instructions. The instructions received by main memory may optionally be stored in memory either before or after execution by the processor. In addition, instructions may be received via a communication port as electrical, electromagnetic or optical signals, which are exemplary forms of wireless communications or data streams that carry various types of information. In certain embodiments, the device can be embodied or integrated into an existing item such as a mobile device such as a hand-held computing device, a smart phone, or a mobile telephone with a display screen, a camera flash or a flashlight as the emitting surface, e.g. iphone®, ipad®, Samsung galaxy®. Alternatively, the device can be embodied or integrated into a display screen of a desktop computer, television, a bath, a shower, a tanning bed, a body part covering such as a blanket, an item of clothing such as a robe, a glove, or the like. Methods Methods for treating a subject’s skin, wound, lesion or other skin condition are also disclosed. The therapeutic benefits of the light reaching the subject’s skin can be related to the wavelength of light and power density of the emitted light as well as the total emitted power over the treatment time. In certain aspects, the method includes irradiating the subject’s skin with light having an average power density of about 4 mW/cm2 to about 150 mW/cm2. In certain embodiments, when applying two or more sets of LEDs with different wavelength ranges, the power density of one set of LEDs may be restricted to be less than a threshold amount of another set of LEDs. For example, the power density of one set may be restricted to be less than 10% of the power density of another set, or any other suitable threshold amount. In other aspects, the method includes irradiating a photoactivatable composition applied on or near a treatment area on the tissue or the treatment area on the tissue with a first light having a first peak wavelength which can activate the photoactivatable composition; and irradiating the same or a different photoactivatable composition or the treatment area on the tissue said tissue with a second light having a second peak wavelength, different from the first peak wavelength, wherein the first and the second peak wavelengths are in the blue and/or violet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In yet other aspects, the method comprises irradiating said tissue with a first light having a first peak wavelength; and irradiating said tissue with a second light having a second peak wavelength, different from the first peak wavelength, wherein the first peak wavelength is in the blue and/or violet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In yet other aspects, the method comprises irradiating the tissue with a first light having a peak wavelength of about 400 to about 750 nm, and a power density of about 4 to about 75 mW/cm2, or about 55 mW/cm2 to about 150 mW/cm2. In yet other aspects, the method comprises irradiating the tissue with a first light having a peak wavelength of about 400 to about 750 nm, and a bandwidth of about 19 nm ± about 5 nm. In yet other aspects, the method comprises method comprising irradiating the tissue with a first light having a peak wavelength of about 400 to about 750 nm, and a bandwidth of about 15 nm to about 100 nm, about 25 nm to about 80 nm, about 30 nm to about 70 nm, or about 20 nm to about 50 nm. In yet other aspects, the method comprises irradiating the tissue with a first light having a peak wavelength of about 400 to about 750 nm, and modulating at least one of the peak wavelength, bandwidth, power density or fluence of the first light during the irradiation of the tissue. In yet other aspects, the method comprises irradiating the tissue with a first light having a peak wavelength of about 400 to about 750 nm, and a fluence during a single treatment of about 4 to about 60 J/cm2, about 10 to about 60 J/cm2, about 10 to about 50 J/cm2, about 10 to about 40 J/cm2, about 10 to about 30 J/cm2, about 20 to about 40 J/cm2, about 15 J/cm2 to 25 J/cm2, or about 10 to about 20 J/cm2. In certain embodiments, light is applied to thetreatment area for a period of 1 second to 30 minutes. In certain embodiments, light is applied for a period of 1-30 seconds, 15-45 seconds, 30-60 seconds, 0.75-1.5 minutes, 1-2 minutes, 1.5-2.5 minutes, 2-3 minutes, 2.5-3.5 minutes, 3-4 minutes, 3.5-4.5 minutes, 4-5 minutes, 4-6 minutes, 5-7 minutes, 6-8 minutes, 7-9 minutes, 8-10 minutes, 9-11 minutes, 10-12 minutes, 11-13 minutes, 12-14 minutes, 13-15 minutes, 14-16 minutes, 15-17 minutes, 16-18 minutes, 17-19 minutes, 18-20 minutes, 19-21 minutes, 20-22 minutes, 21-23 minutes, 22-24 minutes, 23-25 minutes, 24-26 minutes, 25-27 minutes, 26-28 minutes, 27-29 minutes, or 28-30 minutes. The treatment time may range up to about 90 minutes, about 80 minutes, about 70 minutes, about 60 minutes, about 50 minutes, about 40 minutes or about 30 minutes. The treatment period will depend on the total joules of light energy delivered to the treatment site, so a higher emitted light power density will require a shorter time, and vice versa. In certain embodiments, light is applied for up to about 90 minutes, about 80 minutes, about 70 minutes, about 60 minutes, about 50 minutes, about 40 minutes or about 30 minutes, for about 1 to about 30 minutes, for about 1 to about 25 minutes, for about 1 to about 20 minutes, for about 1 to about 19 minutes, for about 1 to about 18 minutes, for about 1 to about 17 minutes, for about 1 to about 16 minutes, for about 1 to about 15 minutes, for about 1 to about 14 minutes, for about 1 to about 13 minutes, for about 1 to about 12 minutes, for about I to about 11 minutes, for about 1 to about 10 minutes, for about 1 to about 9 minutes, for about 1 to about 8 minutes, for about 1 to about 7 minutes, for about 1 to about 6 minutes, for about 1 to about 5 minutes, for about 1 to about 4 minutes, or for about 1 to about 3 minutes In some embodiments, the method for treating a subject’s tissue (e.g. skin, wound, lesion or other skin condition) further includes applying a photoactivatable composition to the tissue prior to applying the light of a certain wavelength and power density, for example from an embodiment of the present device 100. The photoactivatable composition may include one or more compositions. For example, the photoactivatable composition may include a photoactivator component (“photoactive agent”) which can be activated by light of specific wavelength (i.e., actinic light). The photoactivator component comprises one or more photoactivator molecules which are activated by actinic light and accelerate the dispersion of light energy, which leads to the photoactivator carrying on a therapeutic effect on its own, or to the photochemical activation of other agents contained in the composition that could carry on a therapeutic effect (e.g., acceleration in the breakdown process of an oxidant such as peroxide) when such compound is present in the composition. The included photoactivators are illuminated by photons of a certain wavelength and excited to a higher energy state. When the photoactivators' excited electrons return to a lower energy state, they emit photons with a lower energy level, thus causing the emission of light of a longer wavelength (Stokes shift). In the proper environment, much of this energy transfer can be transferred to the other components of the photoactivatable composition or to the treatment site directly. Suitable photoactivators can be fluorescent dyes (or stains), although other dye groups or dyes (biological and histological dyes, food colorings, carotenoids) can also be used. Combining photoactivators may increase photo-absorbtion by the combined dye molecules and enhance absorption and photo-biomodulation selectivity. Combining photoactivators may also result in a transfer of energy between the photoactivators. This creates multiple possibilities of generating new photosensitive, and/or selective photoactivator mixtures. Suitable photoactivators may include: Chlorophyll dyes Exemplary chlorophyll dyes include but are not limited to chlorophyll a; chlorophyll b; oil soluble chlorophyll; bacteriochlorophyll a; bacteriochlorophyll b; bacteriochlorophyll c; bacteriochlorophyll d; protochlorophyll; protochlorophyll a; amphiphilic chlorophyll derivative 1; and amphiphilic chlorophyll derivative 2.

Photoactivatable compositions may contain other compounds, such as oxygen-rich agents, oxygen-containing agents, pH controlling agents (e.g., sodium acetate, sodium hydroxide), light diffracting agents (e.g., porcelain crystals, hydroxylapatite), healing factors (e.g., hyaluronic acid, glucosamine), chelating agents (e.g., EDTA, EGTA), lipolysis stimulating agents (e.g., caffeine), and/or hydrophilic gelling agents (e.g., glucose, celluloses). When used in combination with a photoactivatable composition, it may be particularly useful for the device to emit at more than one peak wavelength. For example, when the light sources are LEDs, more than one type of LED is included in the device, each LED emitting at a different wavelength. For example, each LED may emit light at a wavelength that overlaps or matches the absorption band of the one or more chromophores in the photoactivatable composition. Each type of LED may be switched on and off independently. In certain embodiments, the method includes i) applying a photoactivatable composition to a subject’s skin, ii) applying light having a wavelength that overlaps an absorption spectra of the applied photoactivatable composition, wherein the light is applied for a period of time until the photoactivable composition is substantially photobleached. In certain embodiments, the method includes i) applying a photoactivatable composition to a subject’s skin, ii) applying a first light having a wavelength that overlaps an absorption spectra of the applied photoactivatable composition, wherein the first light is applied for a period of time until the photoactivable composition is substantially photo-bleached, and iii) applying a second light having a wavelength that is different than the first light. In a particular embodiment, the method includes i) applying a photoactivatable composition to a subject’s skin, wherein the photoactivatable composition absorbs light in the blue portion of the visible electromagnetic spectrum, ii) applying blue light to the subject’s skin, wherein the blue light is applied until the photoactivatable composition is substantially photo-bleached, and iii) applying red light to the subject’s skin. In certain embodiments, the method comprises irradiating the tissue with a first light having a peak wavelength of about 400 to about 750 nm, and modulating at least one of the peak wavelength, bandwidth, power density or fluence of the first light during the irradiation of the tissue. In one implementation, the method comprises decreasing or increasing the maximum power intensity of the light emitted from at least one light source during the time of light irradiation. Lights from different light sources may be modulated differently, at different times or at the same time. It will be understood that that the modulation of light from one light source may occur over only a portion of the total irradiation time, or over the full irradiation time. In certain embodiments, the power density may be increased or decreased at a rate, for example, of at about 0.002 mW/cm2 per minute of irradiation to about 0.1 mW/cm2 per minute of irradiation, about 0.005 mW/cm2 per minute, about 0.006 mW/cm2 per minute, or about 0.012 mW/cm2 per minute. The treatment area may be irradiated simultaneously or at different times, from a single light source or a plurality of light sources with light having different properties. The irradiating light may have any of the properties described above in relation to aspects of the device and lamp. In certain embodiments, the irradiating light is a fluorescence or phosphorescence light within one or more of the green, yellow, orange, red and infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, for example having a peak wavelength within the range of about 490 nm to about 720 nm. In one embodiment, the irradiating light has a wavelength of between about 400 nm to about 700 nm, about 480 nm to about 700 nm, about 500 nm to about 660 nm, about 540 nm to about 640 nm. In another embodiment, the irradiating light has a power density of between 0.005 to about 10 mW/cm2, about 0.5 to about 5 mW/cm2. In certain embodiments, the irradiating light has a bandwidth of about 15 nm to about lOOnm, about 25 nm to about 80 nm, about 30 nm to about 70 nm, or about 20 nm to about 50 nm. The light source of the irradiating light may be a photoactive agent such as a fluorochrome which is activated by the first light source, or any other light source, to emit fluorescence. Alternatively, the irradiating light may be from an electronically generated light such as LED, laser etc which mimics a fluorescence or phosphorescence spectra. In certain embodiments, the maximum power density of the irradiating light is from about 0.01 mW/cm2 to about 200 mW/cm2, 0.02 mW/cm2 to about 150 mW/cm2, 0.02 mW/cm2 to about 135 mW/cm2, 0.02 mW/cm2 to about 75 mW/cm2, 0.02 mW/cm2 to about 60 mW/cm2, about 0.02 mW/cm2 to about 50 mW/cm2, about 0.02 mW/cm2 to about 30 mW/cm2, about 0.02 mW/cm2 to about 15 mW/cm2. In certain other embodiments, the light generated from the array of LEDs or other light source is pulsed. In certain embodiments, the light generated has a pulse duration between about 10 ms and about 300 ms. However, a longer and shorter pulse duration can be used depending on the application. In some embodiments, the light generated has a pulse duration between about 20 ms and about 100 ms. In some embodiments, the light generated has a pulse duration between about 20 ms and about 60 ms. In some embodiments, the beam of radiation has a pulse duration between about 20 ms and about 40 ms. In some embodiments, the light generated has a pulse duration between about 40 ms and about 60 ms. In some embodiments, the light generated has a pulse duration of about 40 ms. In some embodiments, the light generated has a pulse duration greater than about 40 ms. In some embodiments, the light generated has a pulse duration of less than 1 ms, and preferably less than 500 ns. In addition, the pulse duration may be dependent on other characteristics of the generated light, such as the amplitude, wavelength, bandwidth, or a combination thereof. The method may also include filtering, attenuating, amplifying, polarizing, or otherwise modifying the emitted light by one or more optical elements before it reaches an area of tissue, e.g. skin, to which it is directed. For example, the light may be filtered by a filter which removes a certain bandwidth of light such as a UV filter. The light may also be collimated. In certain embodiments, the phototherapeutic device may also be used in combination with a shield that effectively blocks the light being emitted from the LEDs of the device. For example, when only a portion of the subject’s skin surface requires treatment, a shield may be used to prevent the emitted light from being applied to the area of skin not requiring treatment. Uses The systems, devices, and methods of the present disclosure enable the use of light therapy technology for a variety of cosmetic, health and medical applications. Photomodulation of cellular activity induced by light has been found beneficial in skin therapy or treatment methods.

It includes those seen in allergic reactions such as insect bites e.g.; mosquito, bees, wasps, poison ivy, post-ablative treatment. Identification of equivalent devices, methods and uses are well within the skill of the ordinary practitioner and would require no more than routine experimentation, in light of the teachings of the present disclosure. Practice of the disclosure will be still more fully understood from the following examples, which are presented herein for illustration only and should not be construed as limiting the disclosure in any way. EXAMPLES The examples below are given so as to illustrate the practice of various embodiments of the present disclosure. They are not intended to limit or define the entire scope of this disclosure. Example 1 - Angiogenic potential of light treatment using embodiments of the present disclosure A human skin model was developed to assess the angiogenic potential of light emitted by devices, systems and methods of the present disclosure. Briefly, a human skin model containing fibroblasts and keratinocytes was illuminated for 5 minutes by a system according to an embodiment of the present disclosure which provided light having the profile shown in FIGS. 7a and 7b, as measured using Spectroradiometer (SP-100 from ORB Optronix), and showing the power intensity over time of the light treatment received by the cells in the skin model of this Example. Specifically, the light being received by the skin model comprised a first peak having a wavelength range of from about 400 to about 470 nm and a peak wavelength at about 450 nm, and a second peak having a wavelength range of from about 520 nm to about 620 nm and a peak wavelength at around 540-580 nm. At the treatment distance (10 cm from the skin model), the maximum power at the peak wavelength of the first peak was around 1.5-2 mW/cm2/nm, and of the second peak was about 0.01 mW/cm2/nm (about 0.5% of the first peak). The total power of the first peak ranged from about 35-55 mW/cm2 (about 38-45 mW/cm2) during a treatment time of 5 minutes. The total power of the second peak ranged from about 0.05-0.6 mW/cm2 (about 0.4-0.5 mW/cm2) and was up to about 0.1-1.5% (about 1%) of the first peak total power. The second peak had a bandwidth of about 20-60 nm, about 40-60 nm, which was broader than the bandwidth of the first peak (about 20 nm). In the 5 minute treatment time, the skin model received a fluence of about 10-20 J/cm2, about 15 J/cm2. The second dominant peak was about 0.3-1% (about 0.6%) of the total light fluence received by the skin model during the 5 minutes of treatment. The relative ratio of the power density of light (activating light to fluorescent light) received by the skin model varied during the treatment time. The system providing the light illuminating the skin model comprised a lamp which emitted an ‘activating’ blue light (having an emission profile similar to that illustrated in FIG. 3) and a composition containing a fluorescent agent (e.g. Eosin) which was activated by the lamp to emit a fluorescent light. Specifically, lamp had two sets of LED’s with peak wavelengths of 410-420 nm and 440-470 nm. At a 10cm distance from the LEDs, the activating light had a peak wavelength of about 450 nm, a power at the peak wavelength of about 2-3 mW/cm2/nm (about 2.5 mW/cm2/nm), an average power of about 55-65 mW/cm2, and a fluence in 5 minutes of irradiation of about 15-25 J/cm2 (about 16-20 J/cm2). The skin model and the biophotonic composition were separated by a nylon mesh of 20 micron pore size. The skin model was illuminated substantially simultaneously by both the activating light and the fluorescent light. Since the biophotonic composition was in limited contact with the cells, the fibroblasts and keratinocytes were exposed mainly to the activating light and the fluorescent light emitted from the biophotonic composition. Conditioned media from the treated human 3D skin model were then applied to human aortic endothelial cells and diseased microvascular endothelial cells from Diabetic patients previously plated in Matrigel™. The formation of tubes by endothelial cells was observed and monitored by microscopy after 24 hours. The conditioned medium from the illuminated 3D skin models treated with light illumination induced endothelial tube formation in vitro from both cell types, suggesting an indirect effect of the light treatment (a light with two peaks having peak wavelengths in the blue and green spectra) on angiogenesis via the production of factors by fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Plain medium and conditioned medium from untreated skin samples were used as a control, and did not induce endothelial tube formation. Example 2- Protein secretion and gene expression profiles Wounded and unwounded 3D human skin models (EpiDermFT, MatTek Corporation) were used to assess the potential of light emitted by devices, systems and methods of the present disclosure to trigger distinct protein secretion and gene expression profiles. Briefly, wounded and unwounded 3D human skin models cultured under different conditions (with growth factors, 50% growth factors and no growth factors) were illuminated for 2 minutes by light having a profile similar to that shown in FIGS. 7a and 7b. The system illuminating the skin models comprised a lamp which emitted an ‘activating’ blue light and a composition containing two fluorescent agents (Eosin and erythrosine) which was activated by the lamp to emit a fluorescent light. The skin models and the composition were separated by a nylon mesh of 20 micron pore size, and the lamp was positioned about 10 cm from the skin models. The skin model was illuminated substantially simultaneously by both the activating light and the fluorescent light. The controls consisted of 3D skin models not illuminated with light. Gene expression and protein secretion profiles were measured 24 hours after light exposure. Cytokine secretion was analyzed by antibody arrays (RayBio Human Cytokine antibody array), gene expression was analyzed by PCR array (PAHS-013A, SABioscience) and cytotoxicity was determined by GAPDH and LDH release. Results (Tables 1 and 2) showed that the light treatment is capable of increasing the level of protein secreted and gene expression involved in the early inflammatory phase of wound healing in wounded skin inserts and in non-starvation conditions. Interestingly, the effect of the light treatment on unwounded skin models has a much lower impact at the cellular level than on wounded skin insert, which suggests an effect at the cellular effect level of the light treatment. It seems to modulate the mediators involved in inflammation. Due to the lack of other cell types such as macrophages in the 3D skin model, the anti-inflammatory feed-back is absent and may explain the delay in wound closure. Cytotoxicity was not observed in the light treatments. Table 1 - List of proteins with statistically significant difference secretion ratio between treated and untreated control at day 3.

Furthermore, if there are two light sources with two peaks, the relative power of each may vary over time, FIG. 8 illustrates the decrease in total power over a 5 minute treatment time. FIG. 9 illustrates an increase in total power over time. In one embodiment, FIGS. 8 and 9 may be generated by a system comprising a lamp with an emitting profile such as the one illustrated in FIG. 3 and a fluorescent composition, with FIG. 8 showing the decrease in total power of the emitted fluorescence of the composition with time, and FIG. 9 showing an increase in the power of the lamp being transmitted through the biophotonic composition. Example 3 - Collagen formation Dermal human fibroblasts were illuminated with light and assessed with regard to collagen formation. Dermal human fibroblasts were plated in glass-bottomed dishes with wells (MatTek®). There were approximately 4000 cells per well. After 48 hours, the glass-bottomed dishes were inverted and the cells were treated through the glass bottom with (A) a no light (control), (Β) sunlight exposure for about 13 minutes at noon (control), (C) sunlight plus a light having a peak wavelength of about 550-570 nm (with a wavelength range of about 480-620 nm), a maximum power at the peak wavelength of about 0.01 to about 0.065 mW/cm2/ nm, a total peak power of about 3-5 mW/cm2, and a bandwidth of about 50-70nm, and (D) a light comprising two emission peaks, a first peak having a peak wavelength of about 440-460 nm, a bandwidth of about 18-23 nm, a total peak power of about 25-95 mW/cm2, and a maximum power at the peak wavelength of about 1 to about 3.5 mW/cm2/nm, and a second peak having a peak wavelength of about 550-570 nm, a bandwidth of about 50-70nm, a total peak power of about 3-5 mW/cm2, and a maximum power at the peak wavelength of about 0.01 to about 0.065 mW/cm2/nm (shown in FIG. 10a and FIG.lOb). After the treatment, the cells were washed and incubated in regular medium for 48 hours. A collagen assay was then performed on the supernatant using the Picro-Sirius red method. This involved adding Sirius red dye solution in picric acid to the supernatant, incubating with gentle agitation for 30 minutes followed by centrifugation to form a pellet. The pellet was washed first with 0.1Ν HC1 and then 0.5 Ν NaOH to remove free dye. After centrifugation, the suspension was read at 540 nm for collagen type I. The results are shown in Table 3. Table 3 - A qualitative comparison of collagen type I concentration in a dermal human fibroblast supernatant exposed to treatment methods A, Β, C and D as described above. ++ indicates collagen levels about twice as high as +, and -Η-+ indicates collagen levels about three times as high as +. (A) (Β) (C) (D) No light (control) Sunlight (control) Sunlight + light with peak wavelength of about 550-570 nm Light with peak wavelength 440-460 nm and light with peak wavelength of about 550-570 nm Collagen concentration + + +++ +++ There was a statistical difference between the collagen levels induced by light (C) and (D) compared to the no light and sunlight alone controls. Collagen generation is indicative of a potential for tissue repair including stabilization of granulation tissue and decreasing of wound size. It is also linked to reduction of fine lines, a decrease in pore size, improvement of texture and improvement of tensile strength of intact skin. It is to be reasonably expected that the same or similar effects can be obtained with a device or a system providing substantially similar or equivalent light emission properties as the systems described in Examples 1-3. For example, the system can comprise a lamp and a light emitting compound. Example 4 - Antibacterial effect Bacterial suspensions of Propioniobacterium acnes (p.acnes) were placed in a 12 well plate and incubated at about 35°C for about 24h in an anaerobic chamber. The bacterial suspensions were illuminated with the following lamps according to embodiment of the present disclosure: (A) a first lamp emitting a single peak at around 440-470 nm having a bandwidth of about 18-22 nm, a total power of about 60-150mW/cm2 at 5 cm distance from the suspension, and a total fluence irradiating the suspension after 5 minutes of illumination of about 18-39 J/cm2. Total emission wavelength ranged from about 400-500nm. No UV; and (Β) a second lamp with an emission profile similar to that of FIG. 3, emitting a first peak having a peak wavelength around 440-470 nm having a bandwidth of about 18-22 nm, and a second peak having a peak wavelength at around 410-420 nm, a total power of about 60-150 mW/cm2 (about 125 mW/cm2) at 5 cm, and a total fluence after 5 minutes of about 18-39 J/cm2 (about 35 J/cm2). Total emitted wavelength ranged from about 400-500nm. No UV was emitted. The levels of bacterial growth were assessed by measuring the optical density of the bacterial suspensions before illumination, up to 2 hours after illumination. The results were compared with controls (bacterial suspensions with no light illumination, and media only without bacteria). The results are illustrated in FIG. 11a and FIG. lib. FIG. 11a shows that illumination with lamp (A) for 5 minutes impacted the growth of p.acnes for up to at least 2 hours after illumination compared to bacterial growth with no illumination. FIG. lib shows that illumination with lamp (Β) for 5 minutes impacted the growth of p.acnes for up to at least 2 hours after illumination compared to bacterial growth with no illumination. Further, it was observed with both lamps A and Β that the viability of the p.acnes was affected for about 20-25 hours after illumination. These results indicate a bacteriostatic effect on p.acnes, at least in the short-term following illumination, of lamps A and Β, and a bactericidal effect on ρ. acnes in the longer term. The lamps A and Β were also shown to affect growth, at least in the short term (e.g. bacteriostatic), of other gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains including but not limited to staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, klebsiella pneumonia and pseudomonas aeruginosa. The lamps also affected viability in the longer term (e.g. bacteriocidal) of some of these bacterial strains as well as other strains such as staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Use of these lamps with a biophotonic composition including a fluorescent dye was shown to have a complementary effect of bacteriotstatic and bactericidal on bacterial strains such as p.acnes.
