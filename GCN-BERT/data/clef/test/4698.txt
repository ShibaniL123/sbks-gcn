DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to skin treatment compositions that are topically administered to improve the character of the skin, and to combat adverse skin conditions such as acne, dermatitis, and inflammatory dermatoses. As used herein, references to compositional ingredients in percents by weight refers to weight percentages based on the total weight of the composition or formulation. Dermatological compositions of the invention may be utilized for treatment of a wide variety of dermal conditions and adverse physiological states manifesting dermally, including, without limitation, dry skin/xerosis, psoriasis, ichthoyosis, keratosis, keratoderma, dermatitis, pruritis, eczema, and acne. Compositions of the invention are usefully employed as skin moisturizers, skin softening agents, skin debridement agents, etc. In cosmetic formulations, the compositions of the invention may be used with added ingredients that are solely cosmetic. Alternatively, the cosmetic formulation may include ingredients that are both cosmetically efficacious and therapeutically effective, e.g., so-called “cosmeceutical” ingredients. In various embodiments of the invention, the compositions described herein may comprise, consist or consist essentially of the specified ingredients or specific ones thereof. Further, it will be understood that the formulations of the invention may be widely varied, as regards the absolute amounts and relative proportions thereof, in relation to specific examples, and illustrative compositions. The present invention contemplates two principal types of skin care compositions utilizing Gorgonian extract as an anti-inflammatory component thereof. The first type of composition is a face wash composition, which as a result of the presence of Gorgonian extract is able to utilize retinol in a highly effective manner in compositions containing very high concentrations of water and surfactant components, e.g., compositions in which water and surfactant components together constitute from 60 to 95 percent by weight (wt. %) of the total composition, more preferably from 65 wt. % to 90 wt. %, and most preferably from 75 to 88 wt. %, on the same total weight of the composition basis, and wherein the weight of surfactant to weight of water is in a ratio of from 0.40 to 1.3, more preferably from 0.5 to 1.0, and most preferably from 0.6 to 0.8. In various embodiments of the invention, the amount of water in the composition is from 35 wt. % to 65 wt. %, more preferably from 40 to 60 wt. %, and most preferably from 45 to 55 wt. %, based on the total weight of the composition. The face wash formulations of the invention in specific embodiments thereof may contain retinol in the range of from 0.01 to 0.2 wt. %, based on the total weight of the composition, more preferably from 0.02 to 0.1 wt. %, and most preferably from 0.25 to 0.06 wt. %, on the same total composition weight basis. The Gorgonian extract may be present in the face wash composition in amounts of from 0.005 to 0.5 wt. %, more preferably from 0.01 to 0.1 wt. %, and most preferably from 0.02 to 0.05 wt. %, on the same total composition weight basis. The amount of Gorgonian extract in the wash composition may broadly be from 2 to 10 times the amount of retinol in the composition, more preferably from 2.5 to 5 times the amount of retinol in the composition, and most preferably from 3 to 4 times the amount of retinol in the composition, on a weight or a weight percent basis, wherein weights are in the same units, and weight percent is based on total weight of the composition, for each of the two ingredients. The retinol wash compositions of the invention in specific embodiments may contain water and surfactant ingredients that together constitute from 60 to 95 wt. % of the wash composition, based on total weight thereof. More preferably, the water and surfactant ingredients in such embodiments constitute from 65 to 90 wt. % of the wash composition, and most preferably from 75 to 85 wt. %, on the same composition total weight basis. Outside of the broadest of the foregoing compositional ranges, the composition tends to become markedly less effective as a face wash composition, with respect to cleansing abilities of the composition, or with respect to undesirably high stringency of the retinol active ingredient or retinoic acid byproducts thereof on the skin surface subsequent to administration. In this respect, the present invention achieves a therapeutically effective delivery of retinol that avoids skin sensitivity complications of itching, stinging, rashes, etc. that sometimes accompany relatively high dosages of retinol in skin care compositions of the prior art. The water used as the principal ingredient in the retinol wash composition is preferably of a highly purified form, and may for example be singly or multiply distilled water that is submitted to additional purification treatment such as filtration, ion exchange treatment, etc. The surfactant ingredient utilized in the retinol wash composition may include single or multicomponent surfactant species. In various compositional embodiments, the amount of the surfactant may range from 25 to 45 wt. %, based on total weight of the composition, more preferably from 30 to 40 wt. %, and most preferably from 32 to 38 wt. %, based on total weight of the composition. Any suitable surfactants species may be employed that are compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and provide suitable use and therapeutic benefit characteristics. Illustrative surfactants that may be employed in the broad practice of the invention include, without limitation, sodium laureth sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, lauryl betaine, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, peg-10 soy sterol, sodium cocoate, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, and sodium stearate. Particularly preferred surfactant species include sodium laureth sulfate, commercially available from Cognis/DeWolf under the trademark STANDAPOL ES2, and cocamidopropyl betaine, commercially available from Cognis/DeWolf under the trademark VELVETEX BK 35. The retinol ingredient may be provided as a pure single component ingredient, or as one component of a multicomponent ingredient, including for example the retinol in a vehicle or carrier composition that may for example include preservatives, polymers and emollients, as well as other ingredients. A preferred retinol multicomponent ingredient is available from Tagra under the trademark TAGRAVIT R1, which contains retinol, polymethylmethacrylate, butyl hydroxy toluene (BHT) and tricaprylin, a mixture of glycerin and caprylic acid. The Gorgonian extract, sometimes referred to as sea whip extract, contains caprylic and capric triglycerides. A preferred Gorgonian extract is commercially available from Lipo as Gorgonian Extract GC. In addition to the principal ingredients of water, surfactant, retinol and Gorgonian extract, the retinol wash compositions of the invention may contain any vehicular or carrier components, additives, excipients, and functional components to improve application and/or performance properties of the composition. The retinol wash composition may for example contain thickener, humectant and emollient components, and the combination of such ingredients in various specific embodiments of the invention may constitute from 5 to 20 wt. % of the total composition weight, more preferably from 7.5 to 17.5 wt. %, and most preferably from 8 to 15 wt. %, on the same total composition weight basis. Such thickener, humectant and emollient components may be of any suitable type or types, and single component as well as multicomponent ingredients are contemplated within the broad scope of the invention.

In specific embodiments, the wash composition may be formulated to have a pH of between 6 and 7, and a viscosity in a range of from 3000 to 4500 centipoise, as measured by a No. 4 Brookfield spindle at a rotational speed of 20 RPM. Compositions of the invention may be made up in simple mixing/blending operations, using slow speed agitation to avoid excessive aeration, with gentle heating optionally being employed to solubilize and homogenize specific ingredients as necessary. The wash composition of the invention may be applied by hand, or by an absorptive applicator such as a pad, sponge or the like, to facial or other skin areas. The composition once applied may be retained on the skin and allowed to dry thereon, or it may be blotted or otherwise rinsed away with water after a short residence time on the skin, e.g., a period of from 30 seconds to several minutes. The wash composition may be packaged in a rigid or squeeze bottle, and the container may be equipped with an aerosol or pump head to facilitate dispensing. Alternatively, the wash composition may be impregnated in a pad or sponge applicator that is packaged for single use application by a user. The package may contain use instructions and normal packaging indicia. The other principal type of skin care composition of the invention is a gel serum composition containing Gorgonian extract in combination with benzoyl peroxide as active ingredients. In such a gel serum composition, use of Gorgonian extract permits high levels of benzoyl peroxide to be employed, e.g., from 1 to 12 wt. %, based on total weight of the composition, in gel formulations containing high levels of water to enable highly effective skin hydration to be achieved concurrently with the therapeutic effect of benzoyl peroxide. The gel serum compositions of the invention in various embodiments may contain from 60 to 90 wt. % water, based on total weight of the composition, more preferably from 65 to 85 wt. % water, and most preferably from 70 to 80 wt. %, on the same total composition weight basis.

It will be recognized that one or multiple species of each of such components may be employed in the composition. Outside of the broadest of the foregoing compositional ranges, the gel serum composition tends to become markedly less effective, with respect to skin conditioning abilities of the composition, or with respect to the therapeutic effect of the benzoyl peroxide active ingredient. The aforementioned thickener, humectant and emollient components may be of any suitable type or types, and single component as well as multicomponent ingredients are contemplated within the broad scope of the invention. Thickener ingredients may for example comprise polysaccharides, carbomers, starches, gums, waxes, sorbitols, cellulosic materials, polymers, clays, silica, or any other useful for getting materials.

Once uniform, the carbomer (Carbopol ultrez 10 polymer), and remaining acrylates crosspolymer (Carbopol ultrez 21 polymer) were slowly dispersed. Following dispersal, Glycerin (Glycerin 99.7% (Kosher) USP) and pentylene glycol (Hydrolite 5) were added. Dimethicone (DC 200 Fluid 100 CST), caprylic/capric triglyceride (Gorgonian Extract GC) and phenyl trimethicone (DC 556 Fluid) were combined and slowly added to the first part of the formulation. The sodium hydroxide (Sodium hydroxide 20% solution) was then added to adjust the pH of the mixture to a value in a range of 5.0-5.75. Dimethyl isosorbide (Arlasolve DMI-PC) and benzoyl peroxide (Luperox A75FP, Part#513474) were combined, and homogenized for 20 minutes at 3,000 RPM. The mixture was not allowed to get hot. The particle size of the benzoyl peroxide was monitored every 5-7 minutes to make certain that particles, while visible, still rubbed into the skin smoothly without feeling particulate. Following homogenization, the mixture of Dimethyl isosorbide (Arlasolve DMI-PC) and benzoyl peroxide (Luperox A75FP, Part#513474) was slowly mixed to combine with the existing formulation. The newly combined mixture was then homogenized for 10 minutes at 3,500 RPM, again the size of the benzoyl peroxide particles was monitored every 5 minutes to ensure that particles could not be felt on skin. Sensiva SC-10 was added to the homogenized mixture by careful mixing, and then phenoxyethanol (Phenoxetol) was added to the mixture by careful mixing to complete the formulation.
