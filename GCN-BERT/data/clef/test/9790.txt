(Example 16)
The first step
To a suspension of Compound 72 (25.0g, 203mmol) in water (250 mL) were added ammonium chloride (1.86 g, 34.7 mmol) and ethyl orthoformate (50.0g, 328mmol), and the mixture was heated under reflux and stirred for 10.5 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was solidified with ethyl acetate-diisopropyl ether to yield Compound 73 (19.5g, yield 65%).
