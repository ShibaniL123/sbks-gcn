Example 105A
3-Isopropyl-1-(2-methoxyethyl)-5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-6-carbaldehyde
Analogously to the method described in Ex. 54A, 1.80 g (7.13 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 49A and 1.49 g (10.7 mmol) of 2-bromoethyl methyl ether were used to prepare 0.86 g (37% of theory, 97% purity) of the title compound The reaction in the microwave was effected here at 100Â° C. for 2 h, and cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 1:2 was used as eluent in the MPLC purification.
