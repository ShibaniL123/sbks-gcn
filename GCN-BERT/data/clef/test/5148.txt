Step 2. 6-Chloro-1-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine
(E)-3,5-dichloro-2-(1-(2-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)hydrazono)-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)pyrazine and (Z)-3,5-dichloro-2-(1-(2-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl) hydrazono)-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)pyrazine (Example 10, step 1, 2.5 g, 5.79 mmol) were dissolved in THF (58 mL) and then the solution was cooled to 0Â° C. Then, 1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (1.73 mL, 11.57 mmol) was then added dropwise. After the addition was completed, the mixture was allowed to warm up to room temperature and stirred for 10 h. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and then the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (0 to 20% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to provide the title compound (1.8 g, 79% yield) as a light orange oil.
