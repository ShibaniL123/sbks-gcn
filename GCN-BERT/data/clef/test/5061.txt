The invention relates to a device for feeding fibres to an opening roll. The fibres are fed between an intake rcll 1) and a tray 2) and collected by an opening roll 5). The fibres collectei by the opening roll are handed over either to a second roll or transported awa/ by an air stream 9), which builds up in front of a doctor blade 8), from the open ng roll. The teeth of the feed tray 6) can have forward pointing, backward pointing or a neutral breast angle. The teeth of the opening roll 7) are neutral or bent forwards or implemented as pins. In particular with large working widths for example 4 m, it is difficult to produce trays with high resistance to flexing If the trays sag, clumps of fibre reach the opening roll unopened. In the design of feed trays always only the region of the feed roll has been considered up til now. The lightweight cover trays for the opening roll have been designed separately and were not seen in conjunction with the feed tray. Another problem is the mechanical construction of the tray, which should project as deep as possible into the nip between intake roil and opening roll. In textile machinery engineering it is expedient to feed the fibres deep into the nip. As a result turbulence is prevented and uniform separation is achieved. Since in respect to large working widths the trays must be provided with thick walls because of the flexing problem, the tray cannot project deep into the nip as desired. In German 3atent DE 4421377 a feed device is shown, wherein sensor sheets project into tie nip further than the feed tray, in order to measure the material thickness. These sensor sheets are fitted so as to be permanently mobile relative to the tiay and relative to the machine frame, in order to be able to measure the thic<ness of the fibre material. DE 19855571 shows a feed tray, comprising a pluiality of individual trays, which are mounted so as to be flexible relative to the frc me, due to the tray at the same time being constructed in the form of a hinge. The aim of the invention is to imprcve the rigidity of the tray and provide better guidance of the fibres deep into the nip. According to the invention this is achieved by the tray, with a part 4) Df the tray being rigidly connected to the cooperating opening roll in the operating condition and at least one plate-type element 3) being clamped between the two tray parts. As the tray of the opening roll and the tray of the intake roll form one unit, the sagging of the feed tray is significantly less. The cover ray of the opening roll is more solidly constructed. It is also sufficient to provide only one part of the cover tray of the opening roll with greater thickness and to construct a second as a lightweight cover tray. Advantageously, in ordei to better feed the fibres into the nip and prevent turbulence, a spring steel sf eet 3), a plastic material or a composite material as an extension of the trays, is fitted into the nip between the tray parts. For example, if a spring steel sheet is clamped between the two trays the depth to which the sheet projects int d the nip can be easily varied by adjusting the sheet. The sheet or the plastic part can comprise a plurality of layers or can also be divided in the working width. It is however always rigidly connected to the tray. Due to this new tray construction the rigidity of the feed tray can be greatly increased and thus larger working widths can be realized without clumps of fibre being created. With the rigidly ftted guide sheet, turbulence is prevented at the point of opening and thus a be ter flow pattern is achieved. 1.)
