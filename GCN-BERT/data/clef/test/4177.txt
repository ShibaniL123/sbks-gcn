DETAILED DESCRIPTION Example embodiments will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings. Example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough, and will fully convey the scope to those who are skilled in the art. Numerous specific details are set forth such as examples of specific components, devices, and methods, to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that specific details need not be employed, that example embodiments may be embodied in many different forms and that neither should be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure. In some example embodiments, well-known processes, well-known device structures, and well-known technologies are not described in detail. The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular example embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” may be intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The terms “comprises,” “comprising,” “including,” and “having,” are inclusive and therefore specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. The method steps, processes, and operations described herein are not to be construed as necessarily requiring their performance in the particular order discussed or illustrated, unless specifically identified as an order of performance. It is also to be understood that additional or alternative steps may be employed. When an element or layer is referred to as being “on,” “engaged to,” “connected to,” or “coupled to” another element or layer, it may be directly on, engaged, connected or coupled to the other element or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly on,” “directly engaged to,” “directly connected to,” or “directly coupled to” another element or layer, there may be no intervening elements or layers present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., “between” versus “directly between,” “adjacent” versus “directly adjacent,” etc.). As used herein, the term “and/or” includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. Although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms may be only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Terms such as “first,” “second,” and other numerical terms when used herein do not imply a sequence or order unless clearly indicated by the context. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the example embodiments. Spatially relative terms, such as “inner,” “outer,” “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” “above,” “upper,” and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. Spatially relative terms may be intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as “below” or “beneath” other elements or features would then be oriented “above” the other elements or features. Thus, the example term “below” can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly. With reference to FIG. 1, an attic sprinkler 10 according to the principles of the present disclosure will now be described. The attic sprinkler 10 includes a sprinkler frame 12 and a deflector 14 mounted to the sprinkler frame 12. The sprinkler frame 12 includes a body 16 having a passage 18 therethrough with an inlet opening 20 and an outlet opening 22. A plug 24 is supported in the outlet opening 22 of the passage 18 by a heat responsive trigger 26 that can include a glass bulb or soldered linkage-type trigger. As shown in FIG. 2, the sprinkler frame 12 includes a pair of frame arms 30 extending from the body 16 and a uniquely shaped deflector boss 32 extending between the frame arms 30. The frame arms 30 can be generally parallel to one another along their entire length with the deflector boss 32 extending the entire distance between the parallel frame arms 30. The deflector boss 32 can include a pair of concave generally arcuate shaped sidewalls 34 that join to form a pointed edge 36 at a proximal end to the outlet opening 22. The pointed edge 36 extends laterally along a reference plane X extending through a center of the frame arms 30 and is interrupted by a central boss portion 38 having a threaded opening 40 extending therethrough. Accordingly, the pointed edge 36 extends on opposite sides of the central boss portion 38 laterally outward to each of the frame arms 30 within the reference plane X. The arcuate shaped sidewalls 34 taper laterally away from the pointed edge 36 in a distal direction from the outlet opening. The arcuate shaped sidewalls 34 can terminate at a distal end that defines a pair of generally straight lateral edges 42 of the deflector boss 32. The pair of lateral edges 42 can define a generally straight edge that is disposed against the deflector 14. The deflector boss 32 can include a generally planar distal surface 44 that extends between the pair of lateral edges 42. The central boss portion 38 can extend from the distal surface 44 to provide a central mounting boss 48 for the deflector 14. A set screw 46 can be received in the threaded opening 40 of the central boss portion 38 for providing a load on the heat responsive trigger 26. The deflector boss 32 has a width w1 along the reference plane X and a width w2 perpendicular to the reference plane X that is larger than a diameter D of the outlet opening. In particular, the width w1 and the width w2 can be between 1.5 and 2 times larger than the diameter D of the outlet opening and more particularly at least 1.8 times the diameter D. The width w1 and the width w2 can also be approximately equal to a distance from an outboard surface of one of the frame arms 30 to an outboard surface of the other frame arm 30. The arcuate shaped sidewalls 34 can have a radius of curvature R that is larger than the diameter D of the outlet opening 22 and smaller than the widths w1 and w2 of the deflector boss 32. The deflector 14 can include a generally planar central portion 50 having an aperture 52 for receiving the central mounting boss 48. The central mounting boss 48 can be swaged to secure the deflector 14 to the central mounting boss 48. The generally planar central portion 50 of the deflector 14 can be rectangular or square in shape and have two opposing flaps 54 extending angularly from two edges 55 at a location generally parallel to the pair of lateral edges 42 of the deflector boss 32. The two opposing flaps 54 can extend at an angle α of between 100 and 135° and more particularly between 110 and 120° from the generally central portion 50. A pair of sidewalls 56 can extend from lateral edges 57 of the central portion 50 and generally perpendicular thereto and disposed directly adjacent to the frame arms 30. Each of the two opposing flaps 54 also include respective sidewalls 58 extending generally perpendicular thereto and in an overlapping relation on an exterior side of the pair of sidewalls 56. The pair of sidewalls 56 as well as the pairs of sidewalls 58 can be generally rectangular in shape or can have other polygonal shapes. In operation, the sprinkler 10 is connected to a water distribution piping network (not shown) and the heat responsive trigger 26 secures the plug 24 in the outlet opening 22 of the frame body 16. During a fire, the heat from the fire causes the heat responsive trigger 26 to release the plug 24 from the outlet opening 22. As the water is discharge through the outlet opening 22, it impinges upon the deflector boss 32 where the pointed edge 36 of the arcuate shaped sidewalls 34 generally divides the flow of water into two equal streams that are redirected in two lateral directions along the arcuate shaped sidewalls 34. As the two equal streams engage the deflector 14, the two opposing flaps 54 direct the water flow in a downward angular direction while the sidewalls 56 and 58 of the deflector 14 maintain the direction of flow in the desired distinct flow directions. The foregoing description of the embodiments has been provided for purposes of illustration and description. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the disclosure. Individual elements or features of a particular embodiment are generally not limited to that particular embodiment, but, where applicable, are interchangeable and can be used in a selected embodiment, even if not specifically shown or described.
