6-cyclobutyl-2-methoxynicotinaldehyde
(6-Cyclobutyl-2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)methanol (0.102 g, 0.528 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (3.5 mL) was cooled to 0Â° C. and treated in portions with Dess-Martin periodinane (0.269 g, 0.633 mmol). After completion of the addition, the reaction was removed from the ice bath and allowed to stir at room temperature for 1 hour. The mixture was then diluted with 30 mL of methyl tert-butyl ether, 30 mL of saturated aqueous Na2S2O3 solution, and 30 mL of saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution, and the mixture was stirred vigorously for 15 minutes. The mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel, the phases were separated, and the organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Silica gel chromatography, eluting with 0 to 20% ethyl acetate-heptanes, afforded the title compound 6-cyclobutyl-2-methoxynicotinaldehyde (0.081 g, 80% yield).
