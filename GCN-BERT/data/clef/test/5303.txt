METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONVERSION OF CARBONACEOUS MATERIALS TO LIQUID FUEL Statement of Government Sponsored Research The embodiments of the invention described herein were reduced to practice with Government support under contract HR0011-09-C-0092 awarded by the Defense Advanced Project Agency (DARPA), contract W911-11-C-0018 awarded by the Army, and contract DE-SC0006466 awarded by the US Department of Energy (DOE). The Government has certain rights in the invention. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to conversion of carbonaceous material such as coal and biomass to a synthetic liquid that may be used as a fuel. Background of the Invention Conversion of non-petroleum feedstocks into liquid fuels, such as jet fuel, diesel fuel, or gasoline, has long been of interest due to the limited distribution of petroleum reserves and due to the possibility of producing liquid fuels from biomass and/or waste, which can reduce or eliminate lifecycle CO2 emissions for liquid fuels. Current technologies for converting carbonaceous material into liquid fuels tend to fall into two categories: 1) pyrolysis followed by hydrotreating; and 2) gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. In the first category are processes in which the carbonaceous material is pyrolyzed by heating the feed to temperatures of 500-600°C in the absence of molecular oxygen. This results in the generation of solid and gaseous products. The solid product, called char and/or ash, is separated from the gaseous products. The gaseous products are cooled to room temperature to condense a portion of the gaseous products into a liquid that superficially resembles crude oil called pyrolysis oil, or when the carbonaceous material is biomass, bio-oil. The pyrolysis-oil is then further processed to produce a liquid fuel. However, when the carbonaceous material contains oxygen - as is the case for materials such as coal, biomass, municipal solid waste, etc. - a significant amount of oxygen is incorporated into the molecules of which the pyrolysis oil is comprised. The oxygen in the pyrolysis oil is often manifested in functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxylic-acid groups. The presence of these compounds in the pyrolysis oil results in a pyrolysis oil that has a low heating value, a very high acidity, and lacks stability. The low heating value reduces the value of the pyrolysis oil as a fuel or feedstock for producing fuel, the high acidity makes it incompatible with the existing petroleum infrastructure, and the instability results in excessive gum formation and increases in viscosity when stored at or above room temperature. In order to address these issues with pyrolysis oil, it is often hydrotreated with hydrogen to remove the oxygen. This results in a pyrolysis oil that has acceptable properties at mass yields of up to 30% depending upon the feedstock and if the source of hydrogen is natural gas. However, the production of hydrogen requires additional equipment operating at high temperatures and pressures, and, in some cases, a source of water. These requirements increase the cost of producing a marketable product. Also, depending upon the source of the fuel used to produce the hydrogen, there may be an increase in fossil-fuel-derived CO2 emissions or a reduction in yield. In the second category are processes where the carbonaceous material is gasified at temperatures of 800-1000°C to produce synthesis gas (mainly CO and H2). Because gasification yields a composition close to equilibrium, the specific chemical makeup of the feed only affects the H:C and C:0 ratios in the synthesis gas, thus making control of the composition of the final product straightforward. After removing contaminants from the hot gas, a Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) process is employed to link C1 compounds (e.g., CO, CH4, etc.) to produce a targeted hydrocarbon product such as synthetic JP-8 jet fuel. This makes a synthetic fuel that is very close to the desired product. However, this approach is very expensive due, in part, to both the catalytic F-T process, but also due to the complexities of hot-gas clean-up. There is a continuing need for technologies that convert carbonaceous material to a synthetic fuel at a cost competitive with traditional petroleum-derived fuels. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In response to this need, novel processes are described that obviate the limitations and disadvantages of the current processes described above and converts carbonaceous material into intermediate gases that are used as building blocks for producing a liquid that may be used as a targeted fuel (e.g., jet fuel, gasoline). In some embodiments of the invention, the carbonaceous materials - such as coal, biomass, or waste - is fed to a first reaction scheme wherein the feed heated in the absence of molecular oxygen to produce a solid containing char and ash and volatile gases. In contrast to the prior art wherein the volatile gases are partially condensed to form pyrolysis oil, the volatile gases are fed directly to a second reaction scheme wherein a non-catalytic reactor converts a portion of the volatile gases into a mixture of light olefins, predominantly ethylene and propylene. This process, like gasification in the gasification/F-T processes, effectively normalizes the volatile gas feed by converting it into a gas stream that is relatively independent of the feed composition. In further embodiments, in a fashion similar to the linking of Ci compounds in F-T synthesis, the stream containing light olefins, which are reactive towards oligomerization using very inexpensive catalysts, are optionally first cleaned using standard gas-cleanup techniques and then fed to a third reaction scheme where they are linked together to produce hydrocarbons of the correct molecular weight for the targeted synthetic fuel. This use of light olefins as building blocks results in good control of the product composition as with a traditional gasification/F-T process. Flowever, it also reduces cost by avoiding the need for hot-gas cleanup and F-T catalysts. In contrast to traditional pyrolysis, the main product can be used as a high-value liquid fuel. By combining inexpensive feedstock and the best aspects of pyrolysis processes (e.g., lower cost) and gasification/F-T processes (e.g., finer product control) with oligomerization of the light olefins produced, the process embodiments of the invention enable the production of synthetic fuel from carbonaceous material at a relatively low cost.

Optionally, a third reaction scheme may be integrated. Thus, some embodiments include the further integration of a third reaction scheme to produce a liquid product, such as a targeted liquid fuel, from the olefins. An embodiment of the invention is shown in Figure 1. The carbonaceous feedstock (e.g., coal, biomass, waste) is converted with a first reaction scheme to a gaseous component including condensable gases which includes hydrocarbons and a solid component including char and ash. The gaseous component is fed to a second reaction scheme where the condensable gases and the non-condensable gases that contain 2 or more carbon atoms are converted to reaction products including light olefins. Optionally, a portion of the reaction products of the second reaction scheme may be converted with a third reaction scheme to a liquid product, such as a product that is substantially a targeted liquid fuel. A carbonaceous material is any material including carbon and hydrogen. It may include other elements such as without limitation oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, etc. Non-limiting examples include coal, biomass, paper, cardboard, wood, wheat straw, switchgrass, and waste. In some embodiments, the carbonaceous material serving as the input to the first reaction scheme is a combination of different types of carbonaceous materials. A liquid fuel is a liquid product that complies with the specifications for a targeted fuel, or a liquid product that may be used as a fuel. Non-limiting examples include gasoline, jet fuel (JP-5, JP-8), and diesel. Condensable gases are those substances that exist as a liquid at 25 deg C and 1 atm pressure. Non-condensable gases are those substances that do not exist as a liquid at 25 deg C and 1 atm pressure. The first reaction scheme may incorporate a non-catalytic reactor similar to a fast-pyrolysis reactor. In fast-pyrolysis reactors, a carbonaceous feedstock is heated in the absence of molecular oxygen to a high temperature, such as but not limited to, around 600 deg C, in a short time period, such as but not limited to, less than 1 second, and optionally, also not less than 0.0001 sec. This converts the carbonaceous feedstock to a solid product containing char and ash and a gaseous product containing condensable gases and non-condensable gases. The gaseous component can be cooled to produce an oil-like liquid from the condensable hydrocarbons in the gaseous product called pyrolysis oil. In conventional processes, the gaseous component is cooled to produce pyrolysis oil. In some embodiments, the first reaction scheme is terminated prior to equilibrium to obtain the composition of condensable gases, non-condensable gases that contain 2 or more carbon atoms, or both. In the embodiments of the present invention, the gaseous product is not cooled to produce pyrolysis oil. The gaseous product instead is fed directly to the second reaction scheme. The second reaction scheme may incorporate a non-catalytic reactor that is similar to the radiant section of a steam cracker. As used extensively in the ethylene industry, a steam cracker is fed a hydrocarbon gas (e.g., ethane) or hydrocarbon liquid (e.g., naphtha) and water. The convective section of a furnace preheats the feed and water to produce a gaseous feed to the radiant section of the furnace. Rapidly heating this mixture in the radiant section of the furnace to high temperatures, above around 600°C (such as 600 - 1000 deg C, preferably 700 - 1000 deg C, and more preferably 800 - 1000 deg C), and rapidly cooling the reaction products after a short residence time (e.g. < 5 sec, preferably < 1 sec, and more preferably < 0.1 sec, and optionally, not less than 0.000001 sec) results in the hydrocarbon gas or hydrocarbon liquid being converted to light olefins (e.g., C2-C4 olefins where the subscript after the “C” represents the number of carbons in the compound) as well as other byproducts including hydrogen, light alkanes, light alkynes, and aromatic compounds. A rapid cooling of the product gas freezes out polymerization reactions and minimizes the production of higher molecular-weight compounds. The high-molecular-weight byproducts that are formed are easily separated from the light olefins and recovered as pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis gasoline. In the embodiments of the invention, the reactor in the second reaction scheme would be similar only to the radiant section of a steam cracker and not include the convective section of a conventional steam cracker. It is important to note that, to date, steam crackers have operated on gas and liquid feeds that contain negligible amounts of oxygen. They are specifically intended for and designed for production of ethylene and propylene from oxygen-free gas and oxygen-free liquid feeds. Using a steam cracker for the processing of feeds containing oxygen, particularly a solid feed containing oxygen, is not a conventional use. The embodiments of the present invention utilize conditions similar to those utilized in the radiant section of a traditional steam cracker to convert oxygenated feeds into light olefins. Importantly, this reaction scheme not only serves to produce light olefins, but also serves to convert oxygen-containing functional groups to CO and C02. Therefore, this reaction scheme also utilizes a reactor similar to a traditional steam cracker as a means of not only producing light olefins, but also for simultaneously converting the oxygen in oxygenated feedstocks and excess carbon into a form that can be readily separated from the light olefins or that does not participate in the reactions used to produce the liquid-fuel product. This is an additional advantage of the embodiments of the present invention. In some embodiments, the first reaction scheme increases the H:C ratio of the input, by at least 5%, preferably at least 10%, and more preferably at least 20%, and the second reaction scheme decreases the 0:C ratio of the input by at least 5%, preferably 10%, and more preferably 20%. In this manner, the embodiments of the invention increase the H:C ratio and reduce the 0:C ratio without requiring the addition of hydrogen. In some embodiments, the first and second reaction scheme are executed in separate pieces of equipment, and in other embodiments, the first and second reaction scheme are executed in one piece of equipment. Optionally, at least a portion of the olefins, and optionally a portion of the gaseous byproducts from the second reaction scheme, are fed to a third reaction scheme. In some embodiments, light byproducts that may interfere with downstream reactions (e.g., H2S, COS, NH3). Thus in some embodiments, the light olefins and gaseous byproducts may be fed to traditional gas cleanup operations using traditional gas cleanup techniques. For example, the acid-gas components (e.g., C02, COS, and H2S) and NH3 may be removed with an amine loop. In some embodiments, optionally after removal of acid-gas components and NH3, other non-condensable byproducts (e.g., CO, H2, CH4) are removed through a simple Joule-Thomson cryogenic cycle before the light-olefin stream is fed to the third reaction scheme, which may be an oligomerization reactor. Other gas clean-up techniques that are known in the art may be used. In some embodiments, there are no gas clean-up processes before at least a portion of the reaction products of the second reaction scheme are fed to the third reaction scheme. In some embodiments, compounds which are not olefins (e.g., CO, H2, CH4) pass through the third reaction scheme unchanged, or substantially unchanged. The third reaction scheme may incorporate a catalytic reactor similar to a traditional oligomerization reactor. The production of liquids from oligomerization of light olefins is known to practitioners of the art. However, conventionally, this approach has been limited to processes utilizing light olefins derived from petroleum refining as the feedstock. As such, the feeds to traditional oligomerization reactors contain no oxygen, either as molecular oxygen or as oxygen atoms combined with carbon atoms (e.g. CO). In some embodiments of the invention, the feed to the third reaction scheme may include oxygenated compounds (e.g. CO) or other compounds not generated in petroleum-refinery operations. The presence of these compounds may impact oligomerization-reactor performance and design as well as the choice of catalyst for use in the oligomerization reactor. Therefore, the integration of the third reaction scheme with the first and second reactions schemes involves more than the addition of a process using a conventional reactor operating at conventional reactor conditions to the end of the equipment train. The third reaction scheme is selected based upon the choice of targeted liquid fuel. The reaction pressure, temperature, and space velocity, as well as the choice of catalyst will depend upon the targeted liquid fuel, and may be impacted by the choice of carbonaceous feed to the first reaction scheme. However, it is believed that the specifics of the third reaction scheme are relatively insensitive to the choice of carbonaceous feed to the first reaction scheme. The third reaction scheme is essentially an oligomerization reaction, and one of skill in the art would know be able to select the oligomerization reaction scheme based on what is known to one of skill in the art and the disclosure herein. In some embodiments of the invention, the third reaction scheme utilizes an oligomerization reactor wherein the light olefins are oligomerized to form linear a-olefins with a carbon-number distribution that matches that of the targeted fuel. It should be noted that in the oligomerization reactor the linear a-olefins formed from oligomerization of the light olefins are further converted into cycloparaffins to stabilize the liquid fuel and match the key specifications for the fuel properties of interest. In some embodiments, the liquid product that may be used as a fuel produced from the integration of the first, second, and third reaction schemes, is jet fuel including, but not limited to, JP-5 and JP-8. In some embodiments, the liquid fuel produced from the integration of the first, second, and third reaction schemes, is gasoline, and in still other embodiments the liquid fuel produced is diesel. In some embodiments, the liquid product of the integration of the first, second, and third reaction schemes, is at least 60 wt%, at least 65 wt%, or at least 70 wt% a liquid that may be used as a fuel, such as a targeted liquid fuel. Example 1. Laboratory Tests of the Process with Lignite and Subbituminous Coal One type of carbonaceous material that can be utilized as the feedstock for process embodiments of the invention is coal. Coal refers to a broad range of materials classified by rank, which is, in general, an indication of the geological age of the material. Of particular interest is the use of low-rank coal such as lignite and sub-bituminous coal. Importantly, these materials contain a considerable amount of oxygen. This oxygen can be in the form of water or it can be incorporated into the chemical structure of the coal. An experimental apparatus that integrated first and second reaction schemes, in this example a pyrolyzer and a cracking furnace, was used to test an embodiment of the invention with lignite and subbituminous coal. The first two reaction schemes were integrated as this arrangement avoids condensation and re-vaporization of the condensable gases, from the first reaction scheme. The pyrolyzer was operated in such a manner that the feed was heated to a reaction temperature of 350-550 °C in 1-10 sec. Higher heating rates would produce higher yields of condensable gases, and hence better overall yield. Operating at moderate heating rates enabled testing the first two reaction schemes under conditions that would yield conservative results for yields. Lignite and sub-bituminous coal were fed to this apparatus. The results of these tests are presented in Figure 2 through Figure 5. Figure 2 shows the effect of the temperature of the furnace used to provide the heat required by the second reaction scheme on the outlet temperature of this reaction scheme (i.e., the temperature of the reaction products). This test was carried out with lignite as the feed. Higher furnace temperatures lead to higher outlet temperatures and lower C2-C4 concentrations as more Fl2 and CFI4 are produced at higher temperatures. Figure 3 shows the effect of feed rate on the C2-C4 concentrations. Data for lignite are shown as open symbols. Data for subbituminous coal are shown as filled symbols. The data for lignite show that higher feed rates lead to slightly lower concentrations. The data for subbituminous coal shows higher yields than for lignite, consistent with the higher hydrocarbon yield from pyrolysis of subbituminous coal as compared to lignite as reported in the literature. Figure 4 shows the concentrations of C2-C4 compounds as a function of outlet temperature for lignite. Consistent with the data shown in Figure 2, the concentrations of C2-C4 compounds decrease with increasing outlet temperature. Also shown in Figure 4 is the design target for the concentration of C2-C4 compounds as determined by process-flow simulations of a complete liquid-fuel-production plant using a process embodiment of the present invention. Figure 5 shows the concentrations of hydrogen, ethylene, and acetylene as a function of feed rate for lignite (open symbols) and the concentrations of hydrogen, ethylene, and acetylene for subbituminous coal at one particular feed rate. At higher feed rates, the concentration of ethylene decreases while the concentration of hydrogen increases. The data shown in Figure 2 through Figure 5 demonstrate that the first two reaction schemes can be combined to produce light olefins that can be utilized by the third reaction scheme to produce a liquid fuel. To test the conversion of the light-olefin-containing stream from the second reaction scheme to JP-8, a liquid fuel, tests were conducted with bottled gas representing a typical gas composition of the light-olefin-containing stream after gas clean up. The tests were performed using a proprietary catalyst developed by and available for license from Pennsylvania State University. The best operating conditions and the effect of impurities, such as H2S, on the process were also determined. In this test of one of the embodiments of the invention, the process was able to produce a liquid hydrocarbon fuel with a boiling point less than 320°C with a yield of more than 80%. The results demonstrated that the test product of the third reaction scheme is similar to JP-8. This is borne out by a comparison of the properties of the synthetic JP-8 (test product) to a typical sample of JP-8 as shown in Table 1. It can be seen that an embodiment of the invention is able to produce a synthetic JP-8 from coal, a carbonaceous material. Table 1. Properties of the Test Product and JP-8. Fuel Product JP-8 Density (g/mL) D2887 Distillation 0.8052 (25°C) 0.77-0.84 10% Recovered 135°C <186°C Final Boiling Point 290°C < 330°C Cloud point (°C) -44.5 -47 Carbon content (wt %) 85.8 - Flydrogen content (wt %) 13.4 >13.4 Sulfur (ppm) 2.3 1000 Olefins (%) <1% 0.5 Aromatic compounds (%) 22% <25% Example 2. Laboratory Tests of the Process with Liqno-Cellulosic Biomass The production of gasoline from ligno-cellulosic biomass was tested using a proprietary catalyst developed by and available for license from Pennsylvania State University. The results demonstrated that production of olefins from lingo-cellulosic biomass is feasible and that a liquid product similar to gasoline can be obtained through oligomerization. Figure 6 illustrates that the variation in the C2 - C4 compounds with the temperature of the second reaction scheme and for various carbonaceous starting materials. Increasing the reaction temperature of the second reaction scheme generally results in a reduction in the C2-C4 compounds, which is consistent with the results in Example 1 (c.f. Figure 3 and Figure 4). It should be noted that by changing the catalyst or reactor operating pressure or reactor operating temperature, liquids with different molecular weights can be produced making the process extremely flexible and able to create jet fuel (eg. JP-8 and JP-5) or gasoline. Economic Feasibility In order to construct a full-scale plant, both the feasibility and scalability of the process needs to be shown. Laboratory tests have shown embodiments of the invention are technically feasible based on laboratory-scale tests and analyses. A Class 4 economic analysis of the process of an embodiment of the invention at a scale of 100,000 BPSD was conducted. A similar analysis of the process converting lingo-cellulosic biomass to gasoline was also conducted for a smaller scale plant for a similar embodiment of the invention. The results of these analyses were compared to the DOE design cases for several CTL (Coal To Liquid), BTL (Biomass to Liquid), and CBTL (Coal and Biomass to Liquid) processes. While the economic assumptions vary from case to case, the process economics data of the embodiment of the invention compares rather favorably to the DOE design cases when similar economic variable are included. The capital cost for an embodiment of the invention is less than DOE design cases. Including operating and financing costs result in embodiments of the invention producing fuel at a lower price than the DOE design cases.
