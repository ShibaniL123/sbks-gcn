Reference Example 15 Synthesis of dimethyl-[2-(6-nitropyridin-3-yloxy)ethyl]amine
2-Dimethylaminoethanol (0.32 mL, 3.17 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (4 mL) and cesium carbonate (1.03 g, 3.17 mmol) was added thereto, and the resultant suspension was stirred at room temperature for 10 minutes. 5-Fluoro-2-nitropyridine (0.30 g, 2.11 mmol) was added to the suspension at room temperature, and the mixture then was stirred at 80Â°C for 16 hours. The reaction was monitored by LC/MS. After completion of the reaction, the reaction was quenched through addition of ice water, and the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The resultant organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solid was separated by filtration. The filtrate was then concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to yield the title compound (0.40 g, 90%).
