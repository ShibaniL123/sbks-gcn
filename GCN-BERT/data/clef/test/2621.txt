RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/967,070 filed Mar. 10, 2014 entitled Air Line Protection System, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Presently, biologically compatible air-based pressure monitoring catheters are used in a number of medical applications to monitor pressure at various locations within a mammalian body. For example, air-based pressure monitoring catheters may be inserted into the skull of a patient thereby permitting the external monitoring of intra-cranial pressure. Currently, a number of air-based pressure monitoring catheters have been developed. Generally, these air-based pressure monitoring catheters comprise a catheter having an air lumen formed therein which communicates with a bladder positioned at or near its distal end. In addition, the catheter includes a connector located at or near its proximal end, which may be connected to an external pressure transducer. During use, the volume of the bladder attached to the catheter changes as pressure varies in accordance with Boyle's Law (P1V1=P2V2). As a result, the pressure of the gas within the catheter becomes equal to that of the environment surrounding the bladder. The media surrounding the bladder must be capable of movement to accommodate the variations in bladder volume as pressure changes. The use of air-based pressure monitoring catheters in low or negatively pressurized environments has proven problematic. When the proximal connector is open to atmospheric pressure in the process of periodically replacing air lost by diffusion through the bladder, the external pressure extant in the body site monitored on a bladder will expel residual air from the bladder. If the pressure is low or negative, a significant amount of residual air may remain in the bladder. The amount of air injected is intended to be sufficient to keep the bladder in an active state for a period of 8 hours. If this volume is added to the residual air in a bladder that has not been completely collapsed by the environment around it, the sum of the residual air and injected air exceed the intrinsic volume of a fully shaped bladder. Should this happen, a positive pressure is established in the bladder. The bladder is now unable to read pressure below the internal pressure created. Air management systems such as those seen in U.S. Pub. No. 2007/0208270 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,447,462 and 8,360,988, which are all herein incorporated by reference, allow a user to adjust the amount of air in a system. For example, these systems allow a user to vent the air passage of the catheter to the open environment, then charge the passage with an amount of air. In this respect, the pressure in the resulting charged passage can be monitored and a pressure within the patient (e.g., within the patient's skull) can be determined. To function properly, the air in these catheters with air-based pressure sensors must be free to move within the lumen without obstruction. If a small amount of water should get in the lumen, air is constrained from moving freely, preventing an accurate pressure reading from being determined. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One embodiment of the present invention includes a catheter connector having a hydrophobic end cap or washer located around the end opening to the connector's lumen. The diameter and length of the lumen below the washer is sufficiently large enough to accommodate an absorbent tubular filter that changes color when exposed to fluid. The washer acts to limit the size of the water droplet that might adhere to the end of the catheter and help maintain surface tension on the droplet to prevent it from entering the lumen and also prevents the tubular filter from absorbing liquid, should the proximal end contact a small pool of liquid. The hydrophilic tubular filter absorbs any water that might pass by the washer and thus keeps the lumen hole open. Additionally, by changing color, the filter can alert a user that the connector has been potentially compromised with liquid. Preferably, the connector is composed of one or more clear or transparent body components that allow a user to better see the color of the filter.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. The terminology used in the detailed description of the embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings is not intended to be limiting of the invention. In the drawings, like numbers refer to like elements. The present invention is directed to a plug connector assembly 100 that helps prevent liquid from entering the air lumen of an air-based catheter system. As seen in FIG. 1, a catheter 110 with an air bladder is connected to one end of a male connector 114 of the connector assembly 100. The male connector 114 is sized and configured to couple with a female connector 125 of an air management system 126. In one embodiment, the air management system can be that shown in FIG. 2, which is described in greater detail in U.S. Pat. No. 8,360,988, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. As seen in FIGS. 3 and 4, a continuous passage 111 is created between the lumen of the male connector 114 and the catheter 110, terminating at the end of the male connector 114. When plugged into the female connector 125, the passage 111 connects to the passage 112 of the air management system 126, allowing a desired amount of air to be injected into the catheter 110 and allowing a pressure transducer 128 to measure changes in the air pressure within the lumens 111 and 112. The O-ring 116 on the connector 114 helps maintain the seal between the lumens 111 and 112, thereby maintaining air pressure in the system. Since the lumens 111 and 112 tend to have a relatively small diameter, even small amounts of fluid can block or interfere with the free flow of air in the system, preventing the air management system 126 from accurately measuring pressure. In order to help prevent fluid into the system, the male connector 114 includes a cap or washer 122 located within an inset area 119 and which is preferably composed of a hydrophobic material. As seen in FIGS. 5 and 5, if a larger liquid droplet 12 or smaller water liquid 14 should attach itself to the end of the male connector 114, the hydrophobic material of the washer 122 helps maintain the surface tension of the droplet 12, preventing the liquid from entering the lumen 111. The male connector 114 further includes a fluid absorbent, hydrophilic filter 120, having a tubular shape through which the lumen 111 passes through and which is located adjacent to the hydrophobic washer 122. If liquid does get pushed into the lumen 111, the filter 120 will absorb the liquid, keeping the lumen 111 clear of liquid obstruction. The filter 120 can further act as a warning system to the user, indicating that fluid has entered the lumen 111 and that the male connector 114 has been compromised. In one embodiment, the body of the male connector 114 is composed of a clear material and the filter contains a material that changes color when exposed to water. For example, the filter 120 can contain dried, food-grade dye, such as any FD&C rated food dye, such that when contacted by liquid, the dye causes the filter 120 to change to a bright color. Since the male connector 114 is composed of a clear material, the user can clearly see the color change and therefore can replace the male connector 114 on the catheter 110. Optionally, additional filter material 124 can be located at the end of the female connector 125, around the opening to lumen 112. Like filter 120, filter 124 can absorb liquid and can further include a color-changing substance to indicate exposure to liquid. FIGS. 7-9 illustrate another embodiment of a male connector 200 that is generally similar to the previously described connector 114. For example, the connector 200 includes a lumen passage 214, a tubular color-changing filter 206, a hydrophobic cap/washer 208, and an o-ring 204. As best seen in FIG. 9, the connector 200 also includes a barbed end portion 212 that allows easy connection and disconnection to a catheter 110. Also, a raised key region 210 aligns with a keyway 224 on the female connector 220 (FIGS. 10 and 11), allowing connection of the male connector 200 at only a single rotational orientation. By allowing only a single rotational orientation, a latch mechanism can be included, latching the male connector 200 with the female connector 220. Since pushing the male connector 200 into the female connector 220 can inject a significant and possibly undesirable amount of air into the lumens of the catheter 110 and air management system 126, the female connector includes two venting channels 222 that allow air to escape as the male connector 200 is pushed in. It should be understood that while the shapes and sizes of various components have been described, variations on these components are also contemplated according to the present invention. For example, while the filter member has been described as tubular, other shapes are also possible, such as a plurality of elongated, axial filter strips or a conical tube. In another example, the hydrophobic cap or washer may be generally circular, square, rectangle, or any other shape. Although the invention has been described in terms of particular embodiments and applications, one of ordinary skill in the art, in light of this teaching, can generate additional embodiments and modifications without departing from the spirit of or exceeding the scope of the claimed invention.
