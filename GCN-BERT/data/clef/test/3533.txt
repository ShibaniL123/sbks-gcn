INHIBITION OF ASPHALTENE PRECIPITATION CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/992,072 filed on May 12, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND [00012] Asphaltenes are a chemical class of the heavy fraction of crude oil where they exist as a mixture with asphaltenogenic acids, diamondoid compounds, mercaptans, organometallics, paraffins/waxes and resins. In crude oil, asphaltenes may be stabilized and held in solution by interactions between their partial charges and surfactant polar groups of natural resins. The asphaltenes may be destabilized from solution in any part of the oil production pipeline, from the wellbore area to the refinery. The destabilization of the asphaltenes from the solution may occur through changes in temperature, pressure and/or chemical composition. Asphaltenes may attach readily to surfaces, due to the pronounced stickiness of the asphaltenes, and change the wettability properties thereof. Asphaltenes may also cause the nucleation of crystals of other compounds, notably paraffins/waxes and diamondoid compounds. [0003] The formation of asphaltene deposits in the oil production pipeline may cause operational problems, such as the partial or total blockage of pipelines. The formation of asphaltene deposits may also produce health, safety and environment (HSE) concerns by disrupting sub-surface safety valve operation. Deposition may induce formation of suspended particles which may cause fouling, foaming, erosion and/or corrosion. SUMMARY [0004] An asphaltene precipitation and/or flocculation inhibitor with a molecular weight of less than about 1000, wherein the asphaltene precipitation inhibitor comprises an aromatic core, is provided. The inhibitor may have a molecular weight of at least about 78. [0005] A method of reducing asphaltene precipitation and/or flocculation including adding an asphaltene precipitation inhibitor with a molecular weight of less than about 1000 to a hydrocarbon reservoir, well or oil production pipeline, is provided. The addition of the asphaltene precipitation inhibitor may include a downhole continuous injection process or a squeeze treatment process. [0006] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed descriptions are exemplary and explanatory only, and not restrictive of the inventions. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0007] These and other features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description and the accompanying exemplary embodiments shown in the drawings, which are briefly described below. [0008] FIG. 1 is a variety of exemplary asphaltene chemical structures. [0009] FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of asphaltenes, polyaromatic charge-transfer inhibitors, the mechanism of precipitation of asphaltenes, and the mechanism of inhibition of asphaltene precipitation and/or flocculation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0010] The formation of asphaltene deposits may be reduced or prevented by controlling the precipitation of asphaltene. In practice, the deposition of asphaltene may be controlled by techniques that are classified in six categories: alterations of the production scheme, chemical treatment, external force field techniques, mechanical treatment, thermal treatment, and biological treatment. [0011] The chemical treatment techniques may include the addition of dispersants, antifoulants, coagulants, flocculants and polar co-solvents to control the deposition at various stages of the oil production pipeline. The chemical treatment techniques may be employed as preventive or remedial measures. The chemical treatment techniques may include downhole continuous injection (DCl) or squeeze treatment. DCl may include providing an inhibitor as a chemical treatment to a well and thereby a rock formation of a hydrocarbon reservoir prior to asphaltene deposition. A squeeze treatment may include supplying an inhibitor as a chemical treatment to a hydrogen reservoir such that the inhibitor is adsorbed on to the formation minerals of the hydrocarbon reservoir by a physicochemical process through electrostatic and van der Waals interactions and the released slowly over time. [0012] The dispersants may surround asphaltene molecules to form steric colloids similar to the natural resins, and maintain the asphaltene in solution. The antifoulants may be introduced as a coating on the surfaces and/or walls of hydrocarbon reservoirs or pipelines to prevent the adhesion of asphaltene deposits, and may include polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) or organotin compounds. The coagulants, such as polymers, may act similarly to resins in forming colloids and floes, causing flocculation and precipitation of asphaltenes. The polar co-solvents, such as aromatic hydrocarbons, may act by the re-dissolution of already formed asphaltene deposits. The aromatic hydrocarbons may be benzene, toluene, xylenes, or chlorinated aromatics. In the presence of excess aromatic hydrocarbons, micelles may be formed which can be removed by using steam, a diesel oil wash, a heavy aromatic wash, or a mixture of additives to stimulate the wells. However, even the best performing aromatic solvents may be flammable, carcinogenic, dangerous to handle, and harmful to the environment. [0013] Chemical stabilizers or inhibitors may act similarly to resins by peptizing asphaltenes and retaining the asphaltenes in solution. A comparative study of a number of surfactants, resins and aromatic solvents indicated that surfactants such as nonyl phenol, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid and dodecylresorcinol are more effective in inhibiting asphaltene precipitation than resins, due to the interaction between the acidic sites of these molecules with asphaltene. The surfactants may include a polar head that interacts with asphaltene micelles, producing a stabilizing effect and thereby inhibiting asphaltene precipitation. [0014] The resins obtained from a crude oil have a modest asphaltene precipitation inhibition capability. For example, deasphalted oil is a poor inhibitor with significant inhibition activity only at mass fractions above 60%. Oil-soluble amphiphiles of natural origin may perform fairly well as asphaltene precipitation inhibitors, while organic acids, such as linolenic, caprylic, and palmytic acids, are comparably less effective asphaltene precipitation inhibitors. The amphiphiles of natural origin may be vegetable oils, such as coconut, almond, andiroba and sandalwood oils. An alternative approach is to utilize refinery stream by-products, such as light cycle oil (LCO), heavy cycle oil (HCO) and diesel, as asphaltene precipitation inhibitors. These refinery stream by-product additives are limited in effectiveness due to the high dose required, such as about 30 - 50%, as compared to the required dose of commercial asphaltene precipitation inhibitors of about 0.8 - 1%. Some esters of polyhydroxyl alcohols with carboxylic acids and ethers are very effective asphaltene precipitation inhibitors, but tend to hydrolyze rapidly even at ambient pressure and temperature and rapidly lose effectiveness. [0015] Although in most cases chemical treatment techniques provide a cost-effective alternative to mechanical methods for prevention of the deposition of asphaltenes in wells and flow lines, the efficacy of the chemical treatments depends greatly on the composition of the oil which may vary from one oil well to the next. The performance may also vary with time due to compositional changes and variation in the ambient conditions, such as pressure and temperature, as well as on the dispersion medium. Whether basic or acidic asphaltene precipitation inhibitors will be more effective may depend on the characteristics of the crude oil. [0016] Due to a lack of chemical functionalities, asphaltenes are a chemically inert species. Asphaltenes include an aromatic core and side chains. The aromatic core may be a stable poly cyclic system, and the side chains may be non-reactive alkyl groups. If asphaltenes include hetero-centers, the hetero -centers may be limited to one or a plurality of hetero atoms, such as sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen, whose number may vary across the asphaltene fraction. The conjugated condensed aromatic core of an asphaltene may be the most important aspect of asphaltene chemistry from the viewpoint of interaction with potential inhibitors, and offers a common yet previously unexploited potential for interaction with other molecules. Spectroscopic analysis has indicated that asphaltenes interact with small aromatic charge- transfer molecules, such as chloranil or nitrobenzene. [0017] A new class of chemical inhibitors of asphaltene precipitation and/or deposition includes aromatic charge-transfer molecules of small molecular weight. The aromatic charge- transfer molecules of small molecular weight may be monoaromatic or polyaromatic. The aromatic charge-transfer molecules of small molecular weight are fundamentally different than pre-existing chemical inhibitors that were based on acid-base interactions with functional groups of asphaltenes. [0018] The aromatic charge-transfer molecules may have a small relative molecular weight r), such as less than about 1000. The molecular weight of the aromatic charge-transfer molecules may be at least about 78. According to one embodiment, the molecular weight of the aromatic charge-transfer molecules may be in the range of about 78 up to about 1000. [0019] The aromatic charge-transfer molecules are efficient precipitation and/or deposition inhibitors for the selective interaction and stabilization of asphaltenes in crude oil. The extensive π-π interactions between asphaltenes and the aromatic charge-transfer compounds form stable non-covalent molecular complexes to prevent the aggregation of asphaltenes with other asphaltene-like molecules. The π-π interactions are increased by the extended aromatic nature of asphaltenes and the inhibitor. The charge transfer properties of the inhibitor may be chemically modified by employing various donor and acceptor chemical functional groups, allowing selective inhibition and stabilization of asphaltenes in solution. [0020] The electronic structure and properties of the charge -transfer additive may be tuned by chemical modifications, such as altering the chemical groups and geometry, to strongly and selectively interact with a desired class of asphaltenes by formation of charge-transfer molecular complexes, as shown in Figure 2. In these complexes, one to three flat molecules of the inhibitor interact with asphaltene nanoaggregates composed of asphaltene molecules to form a tightly bound molecular complex. The nanoaggregates may include at least about a dozen asphaltene molecules. According to another embodiment, the nanoaggregates may include less than about a dozen asphaltene molecules. In the molecular complex, the inhibitor molecules are bound face-to-face by overlap of their π orbitals with asphaltene molecules of the nanoaggregate. Such complexes are very stable and prevent interactions between the asphaltene nanoaggregates, thereby effectively stabilizing the asphaltene micelles. The inhibitors may have various sizes and aromaticity, as well as with various capabilities for π-π interaction with asphaltenes. To avoid precipitation of the inhibitors and to stimulate solubility, the core structures of the inhibitors may be based on small polycyclic aromatic systems, such as condensed aromatic benzene rings. The electronic properties of these molecules and their selectivity may be tuned by introducing electronically active substituents of the push-pull type to the molecules, altering the electronic density on the molecular surface. By altering the molecular surface electronic density, the interaction with asphaltenes and the selectivity towards various core structures of asphaltenes of the inhibitors may be controlled. [0021] The inhibitors may include an aromatic core and functional groups. The aromatic core may be any suitable aromatic core, such as a monoaromatic core or a polyaromatic core. For example, the aromatic core may be benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene, tetracene, pentacene, benzopyrene, chrysene or coronene. The similarity of the structures of the inhibitor and the asphaltenes may contribute to the solubility of the asphaltenes. The functional groups may provide the charge-transfer properties of the inhibitor, and the charge-transfer properties of the inhibitor may be altered by modifying the functional groups. The functional groups may have electron withdrawing or electron donating properties. The location of the functional groups on the aromatic core may be selected to modify the electron properties of the aromatic core. The chemical structure of the inhibitors may be optimized for specific conditions, such as on the basis of the conditions of a well to which the inhibitor will be added. [0022] The inhibitors may be synthesized based on a condensed aromatic polycyclic platform. The multiple condensed ring fractions may be obtained by chemical, thermal or electrosynthetic approaches, and chemically functionalized by introducing electronically withdrawing or donating functional groups. The synthetic procedures may be optimized in terms of cost and time. [0023] The inhibitors may prevent asphaltene aggregation and precipitation at three levels: stabilization of individual asphaltene molecules by formation of small asphaltene -inhibitor charge-transfer complexes which exist in solution as free solvated species; stabilization of asphaltene nanoaggregates by inclusion of the inhibitor in the micelles' interior modifying the electronic properties; and adsorption of the inhibitor on the surface of the nanoaggregates altering the surface electronic properties and preventing flocculation. [0024] In addition to the standard analytical methods for evaluation of inhibitors, the evolution and disintegration of charge-transfer complexes between the inhibitors and asphaltenes may be investigated by a specially adapted X-ray diffraction technique. For that purpose, a liquid mixture of asphaltene and inhibitor may be used in a capillary in tandem with an optical heating crystallization device (OHCD). The OHCD allows direct analysis of the process of formation of the adducts between asphaltenes and the inhibitor with atomic- scale resolution. The OHCD setup includes a spatially controlled heating device based on a CO2 laser for repeated heating to induce melting of a sample frozen in a capillary at low temperature. The focus of the laser may be shifted along the capillary so that while one portion of the liquid is frozen other portions remain liquid. The repeated, computer-controlled local heating cycles produce repeated in situ nucleation and melting. Upon crystallization of the sample, an X-ray diffractometer may be utilized to determine the crystal structure of the product to be determined, even when the product is liquid at ambient temperature. This experimental approach provides unique experimental information and the direct evidence of the mechanism of inhibition, which is not available from other analytical methods. Other spectroscopic and physicochemical, such as microfluidic, analysis methods may also be employed. [0025] The efficacy of the inhibitor may be determined by titration with a low molecular mass n-alkane, such as n-heptane, and observation under a microscope to determine the onset of precipitation, which may be referred to as a "spot test". The method is based on the capacity of the additive to maintain the asphaltene stabilized in the oil phase. Additionally, the asphaltene onset point may be determined as a control with a Solid Detection System (SDS) by using a PVT cell and a laser which detects the onset of organic colloid precipitation concurrently with the fluid volumetric data, including pressure, volume and temperature. Alternatively, millifluidic and microfluidic techniques may be employed for screening the samples. [0026] The stability of the colloidal asphaltene, defined as the degree of its resistance to flocculation or coagulation, may be quantitatively expressed utilizing the Colloidal Instability Index (CII). In the CII, the asphaltene solution is considered as a colloidal solution made up of pseudo-components such as saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes. The CII may be determined by the standard saturates, aromatics, resins and asphaltenes (SARA) analysis. The CII is defined as the ratio of the sum of asphaltene and its flocculants (saturates) to the sum of asphaltene peptizers (resins and aromatics): CII = (asphaltenes + saturates) / (aromatics + resins). [0027] The asphaltene adsorption on surfaces such as mica or glass in the presence of the inhibitor may be studied by using atomic force microscopy (AFM), confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). [0028] The asphaltene precipitation inhibitors may be added to a well, hydrocarbon reservoir, or oil production pipeline by any suitable process. The asphaltene precipitation inhibitors may be added by a DCI or squeeze treatment process. 1.
