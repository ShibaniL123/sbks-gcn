Step 2
3,7-Dimethyl-1-(3-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)propyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H, 7H)-dione
3-(2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl) propyl methanesulfonic acid (164 mg, 0.740 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous N,N-methylformamide (5 mL). Potassium carbonate (135 mg, 1.48 mmol), potassium iodide (13.0 mg, 0.0740 mmol) and 2,6-hydroxy-3,7-dimethylpurine (160 mg, 0.888 mmol) were added at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction was heated to 130Â°C and stirred for 3 hours. Water (40 mL) was added to quench the reaction. The reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL x 2), and the organic phases were combined, washed with saturated sodium chloride solution (30 mL x 2), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. 3,7-Dimethyl-1-(3-(2-oxopyrrolidinyl-1-yl)propyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (20.0 mg) was obtained after purification by preparative HPLC, with a yield of 10%. MS-ESI calcd.[M + H]+ 306, found 306.
