3,5-Dichloro-4-(5-fluoro-2-methyl-4-oxo-1,7-naphthyridin-1 (4H)-yl)benzonitrile (Intermediate 12)
Step 1: 3,5-Difluoro-N-methoxy-N-methylisonicotinamide
3,5-difluoroisonicotinic acid (18.78 g, 118 mmol), N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (12.09 g, 124 mmol), HATU (47.1 g, 124 mmol) and DIPEA (61.9 ml, 354 mmol) were suspened in DCM (236 ml). The mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 24 hours. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was extracted with EtOAc washing with saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution (2Ã—), water, saturated NaHCO3 and brine. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated. The crude was purified by chromatography on silica gel using 0-75% EtOAc in heptanes as eluent to give the title compound (18.9 g, 79% yield).
