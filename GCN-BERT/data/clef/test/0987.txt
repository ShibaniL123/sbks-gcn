Synthesis of Compound 67
A mixture of compound 66 (110.2 mg, 0.5 mmol) and sodium acetate (14.2 mg, 0.2 mmol) in acetic anhydride (10 mL) was heated to reflux for 6 hours. Once the reaction was complete, the reaction mixture was slowly poured into crushed ice with stirring, and iced water was added. Solid residue was precipitated out after 1 hour stirring. The solid residue was filtered and washed with iced water (10 mLÃ—3) to give the compound 67 (87.3 mg, 85.7%) as a white solid. LC-MS m/z (ES+), 226.01 (M+H)+.
