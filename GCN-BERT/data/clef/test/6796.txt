Step 4 Synthesis of Compound 11
Compound 10 (750 mg, 2.62 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (7.5 mL), and DPPA (789 µL, 3.67 mmol) and triethylamine (908 µL, 6.55 mmol) were added to the solution. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes, then stirred at 80°C for 1 hour, and allowed to cool. 2-Trimethylsilylethanol (1.13 mL, 7.86 mmol) and triethylamine (1.45 mL, 10.5 mmol) were added thereto, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 80°C for 7 hours. Sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution (70 mL) was added to the mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate (100 mL) twice. The obtained organic layer was washed with brine (50 mL) and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure, and the obtained residue was purified by silicagel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to give Compound 11 (racemate, 668 mg, Yield 64%) as a colorless oil.
