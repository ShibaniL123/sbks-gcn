1. Apparatus for measuring very high electrical currents, particularly direct currents, passing through a conductor, comprising: a body of material exhibiting the Faraday effect disposed in the magnetic field produced by the current passing through said conductor, said body enclosing said current conductor along a single closed path S=dor; means for directing a beam of polarized light through said body along said closed path; and means for detec¬ ting the beam of polarized light after exiting from said body and for measur¬ ing the angle of rotation of the polarization plane as a measure of the current flowing through said conductor. 2» The apparatus defined in claim 1 wherein said body is a closed four sided frame the four corners of which are provided with internal reflection surfaces which are inclined at approximately 45° with respect to the outer surface of the frame. 3. The apparatus defined in claim 2 wherein said reflection surfaces are ground surfaces which are provided with a coating so as to reflect light traveling within said body. 4" The apparatus defined in claim 2 wherein said frame is provided with an intersecting surface which is provided with a mirror coating on both sides thereof, said intersecting surface forming an angle of 45° with the opposite surfaces of said frame, said polarized beam of light being directed against one side of said intersecting surface for reflection within said body, and being reflected by the opposite side of said intersecting surface, after pass¬ age through said body, to said detecting means. 5» The apparatus defined in claim 1 wherein said body is composed of parts which are curved in such a manner that total internal reflection occurs. 6» The apparatus defined in claim 5 wherein said body is formed of a fiber optic. .4 7. The apparatus defined in claim 1 «herein aaid detecting and measur¬ ing means includes: a further body of material exhibiting the Faraday effect disposed in the path of the polarized light beamj means for applying a vari¬ able magnetic field to said further body to rotate the angle of the polariz¬ ation plane of the light beam; means for detecting the angle of rotation of the beam of polarized light exiting from said further body; and means for varying the magnetic field applied to said further body to compensate for the angle of rotation of the polarization plane caused by the magnetic field in said first body whereby the current required to produce a magnetic field in said further body sufficient to return the polarization plane of the detected light beam to its original polarization plane is directly proportional to the current in said conductor. 8. The apparatus defined in claim 1 wherein said material exhibiting the Faraday effect is flint glass. jl 9. A method of measuring very high direct currents flowing in a con- | ductor comprising: arranging a body of material exhibiting the Faraday effect ..| in the magnetic field surrounding the conductor so as to enclose the current ?| conductor in a single closed path S — ffdar; directing a beam of polarized light | through the body of material along a path Solder around the conductor; and determining the angle of rotation of the polarization plane of the beam of light caused by the magnetic field after it has passed along the closed path S=dcr as a measure of the current flowing through the conductor.
