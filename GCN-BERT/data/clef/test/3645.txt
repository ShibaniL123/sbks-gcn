(2) The preparation of 1-[(3-methyl formate-pyridine-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-[(R)-3-t-butyloxycarbonylamino-pip eridine-1-yl]-xanthine
Adding 1-[(3-methyl formate-pyridine-2-yl)methyl]-3-methyl-7-(2-butyne-1-yl)-8-bromoxanthine (1.2 g, 2.7 mmol), potassium carbonate (0.74 g, 5.4 mmol) and 3-(R)-t-butyloxycarbonyl-aminopiperidine (0.61 g, 3.1 mmol) into a 50 ml round-bottom flask, adding 10 mL of N,N-dimethylformamides in, heating to 80Â°C and stirring for 5 hours; after the reaction was completed, cooling to room temperature, pouring the reaction liquid into ice water to precipitate solid, filtrating by air pump and vacuum drying to obtain 1.2 g of yellowish solid, with a yield of 80%. ES-API(m/z):[M+H]+ 566.3.
