The present invention relates to a formulation with which electronic devices having improved performance with respect to operating voltage, efficiency and lifetime can be produced. The present invention likewise relates to a process for the preparation of a formulation according to the invention, and to a process for the production of electronic devices using the formulation according to the invention. Furthermore, the present invention also relates to an electronic device produced by the process according to the invention. Electronic components produced by printing, such as organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) and organic thin-film transistors (TFTs), have attracted much attention in recent years since they can be produced inexpensively in large quantities by printing technologies, such as ink-jet printing, screen printing and roller printing. OLEDs are of particular economic interest here since they can be employed in display devices, lighting sources in general and in phototherapy. In the past, predominantly small molecules were employed as useful components, for example as phosphorescence emitters, in organic electroluminescent devices. The use of small molecules in organic electroluminescent devices (SMOLED) facilitates good colour efficiencies, long lifetimes and the requisite low operating voltages. The disadvantage of such systems is, however, the complex production. Thus, for example, layer deposition of the small molecules requires complex processes, such as, for example, thermal coating processes under vacuum, which results in a limited maximum device size. On the other hand, soluble systems, both polymer and also soluble small molecules, which can be applied inexpensively in a layer from solutions, have the disadvantage of a shorter lifetime. In general, the materials for the production of electronic devices should have a high degree of purity. Noteworthy examples thereof are on the one hand modern computers, which only exist owing the possibility of the preparation of high-purity silicon, on the other hand modern communications systems, which only exist owing to the possibility of the production of high-purity glass fibres. It is therefore also of prime interest in the production of OLEDs to obtain high-purity starting materials. US 2005/0062012 discloses that a hole-transport material having a low sulfate ion content gives rise to better performance of the OLEDs obtained therefrom. EP 1063869 A1 discloses, for example, an OLED comprising an organic compound which contains impurities in a concentration of less than 1000 ppm. It is furthermore known to experts that there is a correlation between the purity of OLED materials and their performance, in particular the lifetime. However, in order to be able to apply the materials by printing, it is necessary to prepare a suitable formulation or solution which comprises the organic functional compounds or organic semiconductor materials. These formulations comprise at least one solvent. During a printing process, such as, for example, in an ink-jet printing, screen printing or roller printing, the formulation and also the subsequently printed layer are exposed to the ambient atmosphere for a short time window (t1). This time window is dependent on the printing method and can vary a few minutes. Within this time window, oxygen and/or ozone from the environment can diffuse into the formulation or into the layer, which is harmful for the organic functional materials and thus also harmful for the electronic device. It is therefore desirable to delay or even prevent the diffusion of oxygen and/or ozone into the formulation or into the layer. To date, however, only little attention has been paid to the purity of solvents. In the framework of the present invention, it will be shown that the purity of the solvents is actually no less important than the purity of the functional materials themselves. Commercially available solvents have a maximum degree of purity of only approximately 99.99%. Thus, for example, the purest toluene available from Sigma Aldrich only has a purity of 99.9%. In the past, some experiments were carried out on the use of solvents having an even higher degree of purity. US 2005/0238798 A1 and EP 01617708 A2 disclose, for example, OLEDs produced using solvents which have been subjected to dehydration and deoxygenation, where the content of oxygen and water was subsequently less than 20 ppm. However, since these processes are very complex preparatively, the need for simpler processes for the production of OLEDs having better performance is of prime interest. It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide a formulation which can be used for the production of OLEDs having improved performance using layer deposition techniques. In accordance with the invention, a formulation is provided for this purpose which comprises the following constituents: (a) at least one nanocrystal and/or at least one functional organic material which is selected from the group consisting of hole-transport materials (HTM), hole-injection materials (HIM), electron-transport materials (ETM), electron-injection materials (EIM), hole-blocking materials (HBM), electron-blocking materials (EBM), exciton-blocking materials (ExBM), light-emitting materials, host materials, organic metal complexes, organic dyes and combinations thereof; and(b) at least one solvent which is supersaturated with an inert gas or a mixture of inert gases. A “nanocrystal” is taken to mean in accordance with the invention a substance whose size is in the region of nanometres, i.e. a nanoparticle having a mostly crystalline structure. The size of the nanocrystals here is preferably in the range from 1 to 300 nm. In accordance with the invention, the nanocrystals are preferably semiconducting nanocrystals. Suitable semiconductor materials for the nanocrystal are selected from compounds of elements from group II-VI, such as CdSe, CdS, CdTe, ZnSe, ZnO, ZnS, ZnTe, HgS, HgSe, HgTe and alloys thereof, such as, for example, CdZnSe; group III-V, such as InAs, InP, GaAs, GaP, InN, GaN, InSb, GaSb, AlP, AlAs, AlSb and alloys thereof, such as InAsP, CdSeTe, ZnCdSe, InGaAs, Gruppe IV-VI, such as PbSe, PbTe and PbS and alloys thereof; group IIImVI, such as InSe, InTe, InS, GaSe and alloys thereof, such as InGaSe, InSeS; group IV semiconductors, such as Si and Ge alloys thereof, and combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the nanocrystal is a quantum dot. “Quantum dots” (QDs) in the present invention are taken to mean a nanoscopic structure comprising a semiconductor material, such as, for example, InGaAs, CdSe, ZnO or also GaInP/InP. Quantum dots are characterised in that the charge carriers (electrons, holes) in a quantum dot are so restricted in their mobility in all three spatial directions that their energy can no longer adopt continuous values, but instead only discrete values. Quantum dots thus behave in a similar way to atoms, but can be influenced in their shape, size or the number of electrons in them. Their inherent atomic size order is typically about 104 atoms. Owing to the limited size of the QDs, in particular the core/shell QDs, they exhibit unique optical properties in comparison with the corresponding bulk materials. The emission spectrum is defined by a simple Gaussian peak, which corresponds to the band edge transition. The position of the emission peak is determined by the particle size as a direct result of the quantum confinement effect. Further electronic and optical properties are discussed by Al. L. Efros and M. Rosen in Annu. Rev. Mater. Sci. 2000. 30:475-521. In a preferred embodiment, the QD of the invention has a “core/shell” structure, as reported by X. Peng, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. Vol119:7019-7029 (1997). In a particularly preferred embodiment, quantum dots (QDs) are essentially monodispersive in their size. A QD has at least one region or characteristic dimension having a size of less than about 300 nm and larger than about 1 nm. The term monodispersive means that the size distribution lie within +/−10% of the value indicated. Thus, for example, in the case of a monodispersive nanocrystal having a diameter of 100 nm, the diameter is in the range from 90 nm to 110 nm. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the QD comprises semiconducting materials selected from the group II-VI semiconductors, alloys thereof, and core/shell structures thereof. Group II-VI semiconductors CdSe, CdS, CdTe, ZnSe, ZnS, ZnTe, alloys thereof, combinations thereof and core/shell, core multishell layer structures thereof are in further embodiments. “Nanorods” in the present invention are taken to mean a particle elongated in length having a size in the region of nanometres. The length to width ratio of the particle here is preferably in the range from 2 to 20. Nanorods are in colloidal form in the formulation according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, the nanocrystals, in particular QDs or nanorods, include the ligands which are conjugated, cooperated or associated on their surface. Suitable ligands for this purpose are well known to the person skilled in the art. Examples thereof are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Ser. No. 10/656,910 and U.S. 60/578,236. The use of ligands of this type increases the solubility or miscibility of the QDs in various solvents and matrix materials. Further preferred ligands are those having a “head-body-tail” structure, as disclosed in US 2007/0034833 A1, where furthermore the “body” preferably has an electron- or hole-transport function, as disclosed in US 2005/0109989 A1.

These units in the polymer preferably result in an LUMO of less than −2.5 eV (vs. vacuum level), particularly preferably of less than −2.7 eV. HBMs are materials which block the formation of holes or suppress their transport. HBMs are frequently inserted between the light-emitting layer and the electron-transport layer in devices comprising phosphorescent emitters. Suitable HBMs are metal complexes, such as, for example, BAlQ (=bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinolato)(4-phenylphenolato)aluminium(III)).

In accordance with the invention, the following host materials are particularly preferred: “Dyes” are taken to mean compounds which absorb a part of visible white light. The colour absorption in dyes is usually based on many conjugated double bonds and aromatic skeletons. On absorption, the conjugated electrons in the double-bond system are raised to a higher energy state and the dye molecule releases the energy again, either by radiation having a different wavelength, by dissociation to give a free electron-hole pair or by emission of heat. Examples of dyes are absorber materials for organic solar cells or the metal complex dye for dye-sensitised solar cells.

Particular preference is given here to a combination of a light-emitting material and a host material. The formulation according to the invention can be in the form of a solution, emulsion or dispersion. An emulsion is taken to mean a finely divided mixture of two normally immiscible liquids without visible separation. The emulsion may also be a miniemulsion or nanoemulsion, which are taken to mean emulsions which are thermodynamically stable. These emulsions are optically transparent and form without the high supply of energy which is otherwise necessary for the preparation of emulsions. For the preparation of a microemulsion or nanoemulsion, use is usually made of co-surfactants or co-solvents. Emulsions comprising two solvents are employed, in particular, if the substances to be dissolved have better solubility therein. A dispersion is taken to mean a heterogeneous mixture of at least two substances which do not or scarcely dissolve in one another or bond chemically to one another. In general, these are colloids. The nanocrystal or the functional organic material (dispersed phase) here is very finely distributed in the solvent (dispersion medium). More on emulsion and dispersion and uses thereof in organic electronic devices has already been described in various publications, such as, for examples, WO 2011/076323, WO 2011/076314, WO 2011/076326 etc. These are hereby incorporated in their totally by way of reference. The inert gas used for the supersaturation of the solvent of the formulation according to the invention is preferably N2, a noble gas, CO2 or a combination thereof. The noble gas used is preferably helium, neon or argon, where argon is particularly preferred. It is furthermore preferred for the content of inorganic, non-metallic impurities in the solvent to be less than 500 ppm, more preferably 300 ppm, even more preferably 200 ppm and most preferably 100 ppm. Inorganic, non-metallic impurities are taken to mean all inorganic compounds which do not contain metals. In accordance with the invention, this means, in particular, halogens or halides. In addition, the content of metallic impurities in the solvent is preferably less than 500 ppm, more preferably 300 ppm, even more preferably 200 ppm and most preferably 100 ppm, where a metal atom is intended to be counted as a particle. The content of O2 and H2O in the solvent taken together is preferably less than 500 ppm, more preferably less than 300 ppm, even more preferably less than 100 ppm, furthermore preferably less than 50 ppm and most preferably less than 20 ppm. Furthermore, the purity of the solvent is preferably at least 99.8% by weight, more preferably 99.9% by weight. The purity of the solvent can be determined via HPLC-MS analysis. The at least one solvent employed in the formulation according to the invention is preferably selected from the group consisting of optionally substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic hydrocarbon compounds, dialkyl-formamides, aliphatic linear, branched or heteroaliphatic cyclic hydrocarbons and mixtures thereof. Organic solvents which can be used are dichloromethane, trichloromethane, monochlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, anisole, mesitylene, morpholine, toluene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, 1,4-dioxane, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, ethyl acetat, n butyl acetate, dimethylacetamide, tetralin, decalin, indane, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), propylene carbonate, dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethyl acetate, acetone, acetonitrile, formic acid, n-butanol, isopropanol, n-propanol, acetic acid, ethanol, methanol or also mixtures thereof. The optionally substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic hydrocarbon compound is preferably selected from the group consisting of toluene, xylene, anisole and other phenol ethers, pyridine, pyrazine, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene, and derivatives thereof. Dialkylformamides are taken to mean compounds which are substituted on the amide nitrogen by two alkyl groups, where methyl and ethyl are preferred as alkyl groups. Examples are dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methyl-pyrrolidones (NMP), dimethylacetamide (DMAC) and derivatives thereof. Of the aliphatic linear, branched or cyclic hydrocarbons, preference is given to the following: cyclohexanone, propylene carbonate, dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF), ethyl acetate, acetone, acetonitrile, formic acid, n-butanol, isopropanol, n-propano, acetic acid, ethanol, methanol, pyrrolidones and derivatives thereof. The solvent employed in the formulation according to the invention is preferably freed as far as possible from impurities before use. This can be accomplished by recrystallisation at low temperatures, vacuum evaporation, distillation or extraction. However, the freeing of the solvent from dissolved gaseous molecules, such as, for examples, oxygen, or water is preferably carried out by passing inert gas through the solvent. In this way, saturation or supersaturation of the solvent with the inert gas also occurs. The inert gases mentioned above are preferably used here. In accordance with the invention, “supersaturated” means that at least 90% of the dissolved gases, more preferably at least 95% and most preferably at least 99%, in the solvent are inert gases, and the gas absorption capacity for inert gas in the solvent is preferably also exhausted to the extent of at least 95%, more preferably at least 99%. In an embodiment, the saturated or supersaturated solvents or formulation can be generated under inert-gas atmosphere using high pressure, for example by compression. The solubility of noble gases in solvents can be determined by means of headspace gas chromatography (HS-GC). The analytical method gas chromatography (GC) is taken to mean an analytical separation method for the qualitative and quantitative determination of volatile compounds or gases. In this method, the sample is, if necessary, evaporated via an injector and applied to a chromatographic separating column. For direct introduction of the sample into the gas chromatographs, ready volatility and stability of the sample constituents at the temperatures prevailing in the GC must be presupposed. The chromatographic column represents the so-called stationary phase. The analytes present in the mobile phase can interact therewith to different extents and consequently leave the column again separately at different retention times. The mobile phase is provided by an inert gas flowing through the column. Depending on the analytes to be detected, the column exit is connected to a suitable detector which records the substances and enables quantification of the analytes in the sample via calibration with suitable standards. A simple way of separating off volatile constituents from the non-volatile or only low-volatility matrix is the so-called headspace technique. In this, the sample is located in an analysis vessel which is sealed by a septum. An equilibrium of the volatile constituents between gas space and sample which depends on the nature and concentration of the analytes becomes established in the headspace above the sample at temperatures which are elevated in practice. With the aid of a gas-tight syringe, an aliquot of the headspace above the sample is taken and injected directly into the injector of the gas chromatograph. This enables trace matrix separation to be achieved, which enables sensitive analysis without exposing the gas chromatograph to the non-volatile sample constituents, some of which are harmful to the system. In this way, gases dissolved in liquids can also be analysed. In general, packed columns are preferred here over the fused silica columns often used today. They are frequently filled with molecular sieves in order to ensure separation of the gases from one another. Detectors here in the determination of noble gases can be, inter alia, mass spectrometers or thermal conductivity detectors. Volatility of the analytes and slight contamination by the environment must be taken into account. The poor solubility of the gases in liquids can frequently result in a sensitivity problem. Calibration standards can be prepared by saturation of the sample with the gas to be determined and by complete degassing of the solutions under controlled conditions. Knowledge of the solubility under given conditions must be available in this approach. The signal obtained for the sample to be analysed is compared with the signals of the calibration standards described above. Another possibility arises if it is assumed that the solubility of the gases in the liquid to be analysed approaches zero at elevated temperatures. In this case, the sample is brought into thermal equilibrium at elevated temperatures (for example 80-120° C.), and the gas space is analysed. The signal obtained can be compared with the signal of a known gas mixture. Ideally, a mixture of the analyte gas in for the concentration to be expected in the sample in the mobile phase employed in each case, for example He, is used here. Accordingly, the present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of a formulation according to the invention in which, in a first step, the nanocrystal or the functional organic material is dissolved in a solvent and, in a second step, is degassed using the inert gas. Between these steps, stirring is preferably carried out until a clear solution, miniemulsion or nanoemulsion is obtained. In order to free this solution from any undissolved impurities, it can be filtered through a filter before or after the degassing, The present invention also relates to a process for the production of an organic electronic device using a formulation according to the invention. The formulations according to the invention are preferably used here in order to produce thin layers, for example by area-coating processes (for example spin coating) or by printing processes (for example ink-jet printing). The formulation according to the invention is particularly suitable for the production of films or coatings, in particular for the production of structured coatings, for example by thermal or light-induced crosslinking of crosslinkable groups. The present invention also relates to an organic electronic device which has been produced by the process according to the invention. The organic electronic device is preferably selected from the group consisting of organic or polymeric organic electroluminescent devices (OLED, PLED), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic integrated circuits (OICs), organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs), organic light-emitting transistors (OLETs), organic solar cells (OSCs), organic optical detectors, organic laser diodes (O-lasers), organic field-quench devices (OFQDs), light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), “organic plasmon emitting devices”, organic photovoltaic (OPV) elements or devices and organic photoreceptors (OPCs), Besides the layer consisting of the formulation according to the invention, the electronic device may have further layers, for example an interlayer between anode and a light-emitting layer. Besides the layer which has been produced from the formulation according to the invention, the electronic device according to the invention preferably comprises an anode and a cathode. The cathode may be composed of various materials, as are used in accordance with the prior art. Examples of particularly suitable cathode materials are in general metals having a low work function, followed by a layer of aluminium or a layer of silver. Examples thereof are caesium, barium, calcium, ytterbium and samarium, in each case followed by a layer of aluminium or silver. Also suitable is an alloy of magnesium and silver. The anode preferably comprises materials having a high work function. The anode preferably has a potential of greater than 4.5 eV vs. vacuum. Suitable for this purpose are on the one hand metals having a high redox potential, such as, for example, Ag, Pt or Au. On the other hand, metal/metal-oxide electrons (for example Al/Ni/NiOx, Al/PtOx) may also be preferred. For some applications, at least one of the electrodes must be transparent in order to facilitate either irradiation of the organic material (O—SC) or the coupling-out of light (OLED/PLED, O-lasers). A preferred structure uses a transparent anode. Preferred anode materials here are conductive mixed metal oxides. Particular preference is given to indium tin oxide (ITO) or indium zinc oxide (IZO). Preference is furthermore given to conductive, doped organic materials, in particular conductive doped polymers.

Example 4 Mixtures with the OLEDs and Comparison of the Results The OLEDs obtained in this way are characterised by standard methods. The following properties are measured here: UIL characteristics, electroluminescence spectrum, colour coordinates, efficiency, operating voltage and lifetime. The results are summarised in Table 3. In Table 3, U(100) stands for the voltage at 100 cd/m2. TABLE 3 Measurement results of OLEDs 1 to 7 Max. eff. U(100) CIE @ [cd/A] [V] 100 cd/m2 Lifetime [hrs] OLED 1 2.6 11.3 0.68/0.32 528 @ 1 knits OLED 2 8.4 4.8 0.68/0.32 2700 @ 1 knits OLED 3 8.0 5.2 0.68/0.32 2500 @ 1 knits OLED 4 7.5 5.5 0.68/0.32 2300 @ 1 knits OLED 5 8.8 4.5 0.68/0.32 2900 @ 1 knits OLED 6 5.3 3.1 0.15/0.20 69 @ 800 nits OLED 7 5.0 3.8 0.15/0.20 47 @ 800 nits As can be seen from Table 3, the organic electroluminescent devices comprising formulations according to the invention exhibit significantly improved performance in relation to operating voltage, efficiency and lifetime. OLEDs 2 to 4 also exhibit a comparable performance to OLED 5, in which the EML was applied in the glove box. This may be due to the noble gas in the solvent of the formulation employed preventing diffusion of oxygen into the EML. Furthermore, OLED 6 and OLED 7 show that a further improvement in the performance can be achieved if a solvent having higher purity is used. On the basis of the present technical teaching according to the invention, further optimisations can be achieved by means of various possibilities without being inventive. Thus, a further optimisation can be achieved, for example, by shortening the residence time in air or using other co-matrices or other emitters in the same or another concentration. 1.-14.
