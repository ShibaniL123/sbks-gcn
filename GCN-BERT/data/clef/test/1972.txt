Canadian Application Title: DIAPER WITH BOWEL POCKET Inventor: Wendy Cooper DIAPER WITH BOWEL POCKET FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] The present invention relates generally to a diaper with an insert having specifically configured contours on an inside surface to trap and contain bowel movements delivered within the diaper. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Diapers have been a lifesaver to parents and care providers of young children as well as adults suffering from incontinence. They provide a handy and sanitary means of controlling feces and urine for both the user and care provider alike. However, even the best diaper is no match for containing a bowel movement when the user is in a seated position. Such a position places pressure on the diaper forcing the bowel movement to exit through the waistband area. Such leakage can easily ruin clothes, but also other items that are difficult to clean such as carpeting, furniture, car seats, and the like. Additionally, such leakage is extremely messy, and time-consuming to clean up. Accordingly, there exists a need for a means by which diaper leakage from a bowel movement can be easily contained, in order to address the problems as described above. [0003] The invention is also very useful for infants up to adults while lying in bed if they have very loose bowel movements or diarrhea. It is also helpful in use in hospitals and daycare centers to aid in containing an outbreak. The use of the present invention reduces/eliminates the occurrences of diaper leakage in a manner which is quick, easy, and effective. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0004] The disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by the present invention in providing a diaper insert that has specifically configured contours on an inside surface to trap and contain bowel movements delivered within the diaper. An upper rear portion of the insert provides a protruding section of soft padding being contoured to match a lower lumbar region of the wearer. An upper front portion of the insert is provided with additional padding about the abdominal area of the wearer. When a user, wearing a diaper equipped with the insert experiences a bowel movement, the padding sections contain the bowel movement within the diaper. An alternate embodiment incorporates the containing features of the insert into the diaper assembly during manufacturing. In this manner, the use of the present invention provides a means preventing the problems relating to the prior art. [0005] In at least one (1) embodiment the insert is manufactured to be an integral portion of a diaper. [0006] In at least one (1) embodiment unitary rear and front barriers are removably added to a diaper.

A person skilled in the art will appreciate that many other embodiments of the invention are possible without deviating from the basic concept of the invention. Any such work around will also fall under scope of this invention. While only one particular configuration is shown and described that is for purposes of clarity and disclosure and not by way of limitation of scope. [00020] The present invention describes a containment insert for a diaper (herein described as the “device”) 10, to be installed within an existing diaper assembly 200 prior to use upon a wearer. The device 10 provides features to aid in the retention of a bowel movement, by preventing migration of said bowel movement beyond waistband areas 202, 204 and out of the diaper assembly 200. [00021] Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 2, top and bottom views of the device 10, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, are disclosed. The device 10 comprises an hour-glass shaped inset panel 40 having integral rear barrier 20 and front barrier 30 portions positioned at respective end portions of an inwardly-facing surface of said insert panel 40. The barriers 20, 30 provide outwardly protruding forms capable of absorbing body fluids as well as acting as mechanical appendages to prevent migration of a bowel movement out of an existing diaper assembly 200. [00022] The rear barrier 20 comprises an elevated and generally inverted “V” shaped form which extends laterally across a wearer’s lower back lumbar region 52. The rear barrier 20 is designed to provide an elevated center protrusion 22 configured to correspond to a recessed contour of a lumbar region 52 of a wearer’s torso 50. The containment insert 10 further comprises a front barrier 30 which extends laterally across a wearer’s abdominal region 53 to provide additional containment of the bowel movement. The barriers 20, 30 are to be made of soft absorbent natural and synthetic materials such as polypropylene, cotton batt, sodium polyacrylate, and the like, being affixed to a joining insert panel 40 which in turn extends down and around a buttock portion of the wearer being adhesively affixed to, and parallel to, the existing diaper assembly 200. Alternately, the barriers 20, 30 can be affixed to the insert panel 40 via other fastening means, such as Velcro®. [00023] The insert panel 40 includes a fabric panel having an hour-glass perimeter shape when lying flat, made of similar materials as the barriers 20, 30 to provide additional absorbency to supplement that of the subjacent diaper assembly 200. The insert panel 40 retains and positions the barriers 20, 30 as well as providing a means to attach the device 10 to diaper assembly 200 via three (3) equally-spaced lateral adhesive strips 24a, 24b, 24c located upon an outward-facing surface of the insert panel 40. A first adhesive strip 24a is located behind the rear barrier 20, a second adhesive strip 24b is positioned behind the front barrier 30, and a third adhesive strip 24c is located approximately half way between the first 24a and second 24b adhesive strips. The adhesive strips 24a, 24b, 24c are envisioned to be covered by wax paper 26 which is pulled off at a time of use. Alternatively, the insert panel 40 can be affixed to the diaper assembly 200 via other fastening, such as Velcro®. [00024] It is envisioned that the device 10 would be introduced in various sizes for use with small children up to large adults, thereby providing proportionally sized barrier portions 20, 30 and insert panel 40 features. It is envisioned that as the diaper assembly 200 and device 10 sizes increase, the outer end and center portions of the rear barrier 20 would increase at approximately a one to two (1:2) ratio respectively. It is further envisioned that the curved shape of the diaper assembly 200 along with the positioning of the barriers 20, 30, would form a pocket-shaped recessed area which would hold a bowel movement in lieu of having it move upwards and out of the waistband 202, 204. The device 10 is envisioned to be ideal for use with infants that spend a great deal of time in a stroller, car seat, infant swing, or similar apparatus. The device 10 is also ideal for incontinent adults who spend a long time in a seated position, or in a wheelchair. The device 10 is envisioned to greatly reduce cleanup duties for the wearer and/or care provider. It is envisioned that the device 10 be introduced for sale being packaged as single units as well as in various convenient quantities in a similar manner as common diapers 200. [00025] Referring now to FIGS. 3a, 3b, and 3c, sectional views of the device 10, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, are disclosed. The rear barrier 20 is illustrated in FIG. 3a having a profde which conforms to a recessed contour of a lumbar region 52 of a wearer’s torso 50. The rear barrier 20 is permanently affixed to the insert panel 40 using common methods such as sewing, adhesive bonding, radio frequency (RF) welding, or the like. The insert panel 40 is in turn affixed to the existing diaper assembly 200 via the first adhesive strips 24a, 24b, 24c. [00026] The front barrier 30 is illustrated in FIG. 3b having flat profile, conforming to a forward abdominal region 53 of a wearer’s torso 50. The front barrier 30 comprises similar construction as the rear barrier 20 and is affixed to the existing diaper assembly 200 in a like manner. The insert panel 40 is adhesively affixed to the existing diaper assembly 200 via the adhesive strips 24a, 24b, 24c (as seen in FIG. 3c). The insert panel portion 40 of the device 10 conforms to the curvature of the diaper assembly 200 when installed and affixed to the wearer. [00027] Referring now to FIG. 4, a top view of a first alternate embodiment 100 of the present invention depicting integration of the present invention into a conventional diaper assembly 200, is disclosed. The first alternate embodiment 100 depicts the present invention 10 being integrated into the construction of the diaper assembly 200 using common methods such as sewing, adhesive bonding, RF welding, or the like during initial manufacturing of the diaper assembly 200. The diaper assembly 200 is illustrated here including a rear waistband 202, a front waistband 204, a pair of rear wings 205, a pair of front wings 206, a pair of elastic leg openings 208, and a plurality of tape fasteners 210. The first alternate embodiment 100 is further envisioned to include similar portions as the preferred embodiment 10 including an alternate rear barrier 220, an alternate front barrier 230, and an alternate insert panel 240. Said alternate portions 220, 230, 240 are to provide similar absorbency and mechanical containment functions as the respective counterparts of the previously described preferred embodiment 10. [00028] Referring now to FIGS. 5a, 5b, and 5c, top and bottom views of unitary rear barrier 310 and unitary front barrier 320 portions of a second alternate embodiment 300 of the invention are disclosed. The second alternate embodiment 300 provides unitary rear barrier 310 and a unitary front barrier 320 portions being similar in shape and profile as the previously described preferred rear barrier 20 and front barrier 30 portions respectively. Each unitary barrier 310, 320 provides a means of individual positioning and adhesive attachment to an existing diaper 200 via corresponding unitary adhesive strip 330 and wax paper 26 portions along a rear surface. Alternately, the unitary barriers 310, 320 can be affixed to an existing diaper 200 via other fastening means, such as Velcro®. The unitary barriers 310, 320 are intended to allow a user to accurately position each unitary barrier 310, 320 individually to a desired position as well as provide a possible cost savings resulting from using only a single barrier 310, 320 if so inclined. It is envisioned that the unitary barriers 310, 320 would be introduced being packaged and sold in combined and separate formats in various quantities based upon a user’s preference and need.
