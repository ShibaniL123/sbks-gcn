Example 4
4-{[(6-tert-Butyl-3-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylic acid
3.2 ml (3.2 mmol) of 1 M aqueous sodium hydroxide solution were added to a solution of 300 mg (0.62 mmol) of the compound from Example 46A in a mixture of 12.5 ml of THF and 2.5 ml of methanol, and the mixture was stirred under reflux for 1 h. After cooling to RT, the mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was then taken up in water and the mixture was adjusted to pH 1-2 using 1 M hydrochloric acid. The solid formed was filtered off, washed with water and dried under reduced pressure. This gave 227 mg (78% of theory, purity 100%) of the title compound
