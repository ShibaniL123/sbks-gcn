BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE I. Field of the Disclosure A non-limiting embodiment relates to a method of promoting hair growth or preventing hair loss, comprising administering intradermally or subcutaneously Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or a mixture of bFGF with platelet rich plasma (PRP) and/or blood plasma. II. Description of the Related Art Hair loss can cause someone to look notably older than his or her actual age and can otherwise make him or her look less attractive. The cause of hair loss includes a part of the natural aging process, compromised hair growth cycle, genetic predisposition, unwanted side effects from medication and/or medical treatment, environmental causes such as allergies, infections, stress, a lack of proper diet and sleep, and/or other systematic disorders. According to research results available in the web (e.g., www.statisticbrain.com/hair-loss-statistics), by age 35, it is estimated that 40% of males in the United States will have some noticeable hair loss. This condition gets worse as men get older. By age 60, it is estimated that 65% of adult males in the United States will suffer from noticeable hair loss. FIG. 1 shows that male-pattern baldness occurs in varying forms with a significant portion of the male population. Women also suffer from hair loss. Female hair loss, unlike in men, typically involves noticeable thinning all over the head and the hairline. The American Academy of Dermatology reports that 40% of women have noticeable hair loss by the age 40. Despite this widespread problem, hair loss may not be seen as normal or acceptable for women due in part to social norms that may pressure women to look their best. Even a slight thinning of hair, if noticeable, may be undesirable to a woman's self-image and how others may judge her. Therefore, many attempts to prevent and treat hair loss including medications, invasive surgical procedures, and injections have been made in the market. Medications such as MINOXIDIL® (Rogains), FINASTERIDE® (Propecia) and DUTASTERIDE® (Avodart) are an approved treatment for hair loss. However, these medications have shortcomings because, to be effective, the patient is required to take the medication daily. Further, the medication will work in the long term only if the patient continues to take the medication. Any discontinuance is likely to result in the loss of any hair gained. Moreover, some of these medications are not approved for use by women because of safety concerns. Invasive hair loss treatment available includes surgical procedures such as follicle unit transplantation, scalp reduction or scalp flaps, and injection methods. These surgical procedures have a risk of possible skin necrosis or keloid scar tissue formation at donor region. These surgical procedures also often produce unsatisfactory results such as unnatural looking hair growth due to direction of hair growth and limitations on the number of hair follicles that can be safely transferred (less than 4000 hair follicles can be transferred every procedure with the maximum of 3 procedures in a patient's entire life). Such surgical treatment is also inconvenient for patients because it often requires 3-4 hours of operation, post-operative care, and disruption of normal daily living immediately after the surgery for approximately 2 weeks (even without complications). Currently, there are also many different types of injection methods, such as methotherapy, plate rich plasma (PRP)-alone injection, PRP+ACELL® Injection, and others. A wealth of literature has already considered the use of PRP in sports medicine, orthopedic surgery, dental surgery, and a number of other medical and surgical specialties to enhance tissue repair and healing after surgical procedures or injury. Every platelet is a biochemical storehouse of regulatory, signaling and growth-factor molecules that participate in recovery and healing of tissue as well as emergency response to injury. Growth-factor molecules associated with platelets include: Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), Transforming growth-factor-beta (TGF-b), Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Epidermal growth factor (EGF), Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), and Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) (International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery, Platelet-Rich Plasma in Hair Transplantation, Oct. 1, 2009). Based on this literature, PRP injections and PRP+ACELL® Injection have been used for treating hair loss. However, the results of these injection methods vary widely. Often the results are conflicting and questionable. The existing injection method treatment, while restoring hair to some individuals, lacks the consistency to make it work for significant other populations suffering from hair loss. Having perceived such lack of effective treatment for hair loss, the inventor looked at leading theories on hair loss, including (a) Dihydrotestosterone Theory, (b) Gravity Theory, and (c) Blood Supply Theory. Dihydrotestosterone Theory is currently the leading theory hypothesizing that dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binds to hair follicles and shrinks hair follicles, making it impossible for healthy hair to survive. However, this theory does not explain why high levels of DHT do not affect hair loss to some individuals. Most men with high levels of DHT still have growing hair in the back of their heads and sides. In addition, these men also have healthy growing hair in other parts of their body such as armpit, legs, chest, and pubic area. One theory trying to answer such paradoxical result of the Dihydrotestosterone Theory is the Gravity Theory of Hair Loss (“Gravity Theory”). This theory hypothesizes that the effects of gravity may be a contributing factor to hair loss. One special-topic paper in Plastic and Reconstruction Surgery reports that androgenic effect makes the thinning of the scalp. This thinning causes the scalp to have less ability to hold hair's weight firmly. This in turn causes hair to be unintentionally pulled out easier and earlier than the normal end of anagen (hair growing period) phase. Gravity gradually thins the skin on a person's scalp and this thinning of the skin causes the affected area to lose the ability to hold and grow hair. Emin Tuncay Ustuner reports that the thinned skin cannot afford the weight of hair for long and therefore hair can be pulled out easily (Cause of Androgenic Alopecia, Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery Global Open 2013; 1 DOI: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000000005). There are three phases in a person's hair cycle: Anagen, Catagen, and Talogen. Anagen is the hair growing phase in the cycle, which in a healthy person typically lasts 4 to 6 years. Catagen is the phase in the cycle marking the end of the hair growth, which in a healthy person typically lasts 2 to 3 weeks. Finally, Talogen is the dormant (resting) phase marked by no growth of hair, which in a healthy person typically lasts 3 months. According to the Gravity Theory, the thinning of the skin in the balding area of the head causes substantial shortening of Anagen phase (growth phase). The thinning of the skin also lengthens the Talogen phase. Another theory, called Blood Supply Theory, argues that the cause of baldness is that a lack of blood supply to the follicles substantially shortens anagen phase (hair growth period) and prolongs talogen phase (resting—no hair growth phase). This theory is backed up by a product called MINOXIDIL® which was originally marketed as medication to treat high blood pressure based for its vasodilatation property on hypertension. It was discovered that one of MINOXIDIL®'s side effects was hair growth in bald and thinning areas. Because MINOXIDIL® enhances blood supply with its vasodilatation function, it is currently being used to treat hair loss. While the patient is administered MINOXIDIL®, blood supply to the follicles is increased and hair growth is temporarily stimulated. Regardless of the theories explaining the causes of thinking hair or hair loss, there is not a treatment which provides satisfactory results of hair regain or hair growth promotion. The present disclosure is directed to stimulating hair growth. An exemplary embodiment of stimulating hair growth shows that it thickens the skin in the target area by triggering fibrogenesis and tissue regeneration as well as increases the blood supply in the target area by making new blood vessels in the area. SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE Surprisingly, the inventor has found, based on clinical research, that bFGF or a mixture of bFGF with PRP and/or Plasma is effective to stimulate hair growth when administered intradermally or subcutaneously to the scalp of patients. Based on this finding, it is determined that bFGF, a mixture of bFGF and PRP, a mixture of bFGF and Plasma, and a mixture of bFGF, PRP, and blood plasma (hereinafter, sometimes together referred to as “Agent”) are all effective to stimulate hair growth. Based on this finding, it is also determined that the Agent will be effective in growing hair in other areas, such as eyelashes, eyebrows, mustache, beard region, and other areas of the skin of a patient. The inventor has further found, based on clinical research, that the Agent is effective to stimulate hair growth in both women and men of the age of 18 or older, at any scale and type of the hair loss. The inventor found that when administering intradermally or subcutaneously bFGF or its mixture with PRP and/or plasma, rather than using it for external application on the skin surface, bFGF or the bFGF mixture surprisingly exerts significant advantageous effects on hair growth. bFGF in combination with PRP and/or plasma may be used in an amount effective to attain the desired results, such as increase hair number, thicker hair, increased hair growth, decrease of hair loss and the like.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE, NON-LIMITING EMBODIMENTS The following description of the illustrative, non-limiting embodiments discloses specific processes and ingredients. However, the embodiments are merely examples, and thus, the specific features described below are merely used to more easily describe such embodiments and to provide an overall understanding. Accordingly, one skilled in the art will readily recognize that the disclosure is not limited to the specific embodiments described below. Furthermore, the descriptions of various processes and ingredients of the embodiments that would have been known to one skilled in the art are omitted for the sake of clarity and brevity. According to exemplary embodiments, bFGF or its mixture with PRP and/or plasma may be administered in an effective amount intradermally or subcutaneously to attain the desired advantageous effects of promoting hair growth. bFGF, optionally in combination with plasma (in an embodiment, in gel-type plasma) and/or PRP may administered intradermally or subcutaneously, either prior to or after a sterilized micro-needle therapy system (MTS), which more effectively stimulates skin regeneration in the treated areas. This is done by causing a slight controlled skin injury at a tolerable rate and stimulating repair of that area. The MTS causes a slight controlled injury to the epidermis of the target area when the epidermis is penetrated repeatedly by micro-needles which trigger stimulation of collagen and elastin. The injected mixture of plasma, PRP, and bFGF solution helps with the skin repair and regeneration of the target area. Plasma, PRP, and bFGF have fibroblast generating properties. Therefore, this process promotes thickening of the skin in the treated area. Both PRP and bFGF are reported to have angiogenesis-inducing activity in vitro and in vivo. Both PRP and bFGF are used to heal wounds. By mixing PRP and bFGF, our research has shown that a more potent blood vessel formation can occur. Using the MTS causes a slight controlled injury to the epidermis of the target area when the epidermis is penetrated repeatedly by micro-needles. The injected mixture of plasma and PRP helps to repair this injury while helping to form new blood vessels in the target area. The new blood vessels help to supply more blood in the target area. The agent according to the procedure for promoting hair growth is not particularly limited, as long as it contains bFGF, a mixture of bFGF and Plasma, a mixture of bFGF and PRP, or a mixture of bFGF, Plasma, and PRP and is administered intradermally or subcutaneously with various injection tools. Hair growth includes, without limitation, stimulating the conversion of telogen phase of hair cycle to anagen phase in order to normalize (or at least improve interrupted) hair cycle and normalize shortened anagen phase, resulting in regaining hair, improve hair health, thickening hair in the treated area. The effective amount of plasma, PRP, and bFGF or the dosage thereof is not particularly limited, and generally, it can be administered in an amount of 0.1 μg to 1 mg of bFGF per cm2 of skin surface that is the target of hair growth treatment. In an exemplary embodiment, bFGF may be used in an amount of 1 μg to 100 μg, or 0.1 μg to 50 μg, or 10 μg to 100 μg of bFGF per 1 cm2 of skin surface that is the target of hair growth treatment. Plasma may be used in an amount of 0.05 ml to 40 ml per cm2 of skin surface. In an exemplary embodiment, plasma may be used in an amount of 0.05 ml to 20 ml, 0.05 ml to 15 ml, or 10 ml to 30 ml per cm2 of skin surface. PRP may be obtained directly from whole blood of a patient to be treated or a commercially available product could be used. PRP contains an increased number of plates, compared to a naturally occurring plasma. For example, PRP, which can be used in the exemplary embodiments, may contain at least twice, at least three times, at least four times, at least five times, at least six times, at least seven times, at least eight times, at least nine times, at least ten times, at least eleven times or at least twelve times greater than the normal platelet counts in human blood. RPR may be used in an amount of 0.01 ml to 20 ml per cm2 of skin surface. In an exemplary embodiment, PRP may be used in an amount of 0.01 ml to 15 ml, 0.01 ml to 10 ml, or 5 ml to 20 ml per cm2 of skin surface. An agent according to an embodiment may include (a) bFGF in an amount of effective to promote hair growth; and (b-1) platelet rich plasma (PRP), (b-2) blood plasma, or (b-3) a mixture of PRP and blood plasma. Amounts of PRP and plasma in the agent are 0.1-10 times and 0.2-20 times by volume, respectively, based on 1 ml of bFGF solution, said 1 ml of bFGF solution containing 100 μg of bFGF. In an embodiment, the composition may consists essentially of (a) bFGF in an amount of effective to promote hair growth; and (b-1) platelet rich plasma (PRP), (b-2) blood plasma, or (b-3) a mixture of PRP and blood plasma. In another embodiment, the composition may consists of (a) bFGF in an amount of effective to promote hair growth; and (b-1) platelet rich plasma (PRP), (b-2) blood plasma, or (b-3) a mixture of PRP and blood plasma. These compounds may be administered sequentially or as a mixture. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, combination may occur just before administering the Agent to the scalp of the patent. Further, the frequency of administration is not particularly limited, and it can exert a sufficient effect by a single administration. From the viewpoint of sustaining superior effects, it is preferred to administer the mixture periodically for a certain period of time, for example, once a month for 3 months. It is recommended that the frequency be varied based on the health and condition of the patient's hair and the results desired by the patient. bFGF is currently available in the market for only topical application or topical spraying. For example, bFGF which is marketed under TRAFERMIN™ (KAKEN PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD) can be used. However, other commercially available bFGFs could be used to obtain similar results. bFGF can be used as they are currently available or diluted or dispersed in a solvent, mixed with a suspending agent, or emulsifying agent, which will be explained in more detail hereinafter. PRP and plasma may be obtained from the patient who is subject to the treatment. For example, a proper amount of whole blood may be drawn from the patient on the day of the treatment and the whole blood is centrifuged to separate plasma and PRP. The separation could be conducted by following known techniques. The collected whole blood or separated blood (i.e., PRP and plasma) may be stored under proper conditions until they are used in the treatment. The proper amount of the whole blood may be determined depending on the general condition of the patient's health and the condition of targeted area. The source of the whole blood is not limited to the patient to be treated. The whole blood could be drawn one day or more prior to the treatment and can be stored under appropriate conditions. As will be explained in more detail below, plasma may be used as a gel-like form. The following explanation of a non-limiting, illustrative embodiment of a treatment procedure for promoting hair growth involves 9 steps. However, one or more of the steps may be omitted and/or carried out in a different sequence, as long as the agent which contains bFGF, optionally in combination with PRP and plasma are intradermally or subcutaneously administered to a patient. Step 1: Collect Various Amounts of Blood from Patient On the date of the treatment, whole blood is drawn from a patient who is being treated, using a conventional method of drawing blood. The volume of the blood drawn depends on the overall health and hair loss state of the patient being treated. All the blood drawn is utilized for that patient's procedure that day. There should not be any extra blood drawn more than necessary for the treatment. Step 2: Separate Obtained Blood Plasma, PRP (platelet rich plasma), and RBC (Red Blood cell) from the blood drawn from Step 1 are separated by a centrifuge-utilizing equipment. The centrifugation separates the platelet-rich plasma from platelet-poor plasma and red blood cells because of differences in specific gravity. There are, at present, two methods of PRP preparation approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Both processes involve the collection of a patient's whole blood (that is anticoagulated with citrate dextrose) before undergoing two stages of centrifugation (TruPRP) (Harvest) designed to separate the PRP aliquot from platelet-poor plasma and red blood cells. In humans, a typical baseline blood platelet count is approximately 200,000 per μL; therapeutic PRP concentrates the platelets by roughly four-fold. There is, however, broad variability in the production of PRP by various concentrating equipment and techniques. Most of commercially available kits adopt anticoagulant dextrose solution A (“ACD-A”) as an anticoagulant even though there are others such as heparin or EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). Moreover, no kits take the platelet aggregation inhibitor into consideration, although coagulation and platelet aggregation are very different and anticoagulants never suppress platelet aggregation (Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery—Global Open: June 2014, vol. 2, issue 6, p e162 doi: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000000109). Step 3: Soak Sterilized Polypropylene Container Containing Plasma in Safe and Effective Temperature for Specified Time to Make Gel-Type Plasma Separated Plasma in a sterilized container is submerged in boiled water at the optimal temperature (0° C. to 100° C.) for optimal time (0 minutes to 10 minutes) to create gelatinous form called “Gel-Type Plasma.” The Gel-Type Plasma obtained from this step will be mixed with bFGF solution obtained from Step 4 below in a safe and effective amount between Plasma and bFGF. This prepared solution is again mixed with some portion of a prepared mixture of PRP and bFGF (from Step 5(b)). Gelatinous form (or semi-solid form) has better retention when the solution is injected onto the target skin area, but the plain mixture of plasma (not having been submerged in the optimal temperature for specific time) and bFGF can also be used. The quantity and proportion between bFGF and Plasma can vary depending on the condition of hair loss. This solution will serve as thickening targeted skin and scalp. Step 4: Prepare bFGF Solution 500 μg of the freeze-dried commercially purchased bFGF is dissolved into 5 ml of saline solution to prepare 100 μg/ml of bFGF solution. The dissolution of bFGF occurs instantly to create the bFGF solution. The bFGF solution is prepared such that it is in an injectable form. The bFGF solution is stored in refrigeration, below 10° C. until ready for use on the day or up to two weeks later for future use. Step 5: Prepare the Following Two Compounds (a) Mix the following to obtain the PRP+bFGF solution: (1) PRP (0.5 ml to 20 ml) obtained from Step 2, and(2) bFGF solution (0.1 μg to 10 mg) obtained from Step 4. (b) Mix the following to obtain the Plasma+bFGF+PRP solution: (1) Plasma (1 ml to 40 ml) obtained from Steps 2,(2) bFGF solution (0.1 μg to 10 mg) obtained from Step 4, and(3) PRP+bFGF solution obtained from Step 5(a). Separated PRP and bFGF are mixed in a safe and effective amount between PRP and bFGF to create injectable solution, which will serve as promoting or stimulating hair growth. The actual volume of the items listed above depends on the overall health and hair loss state of the patient being treated. In this exemplary example, bFGF, PRP and Plasma are mixed at a ratio of approximately 1:1.09:2.36 (bFGF:PRP:Plasma). There is no specific order of mixing or administering the compound. For convenience, when bFGF is administered in combination with PRP and/or plasma, these compounds could be administered as a mixture, rather than administered singly. In an exemplary embodiment, a mixture of RPR and bFGF, a mixture of bFGF and plasma, or a mixture of bFGF, PRP, and plasma may be administered. When administered singly, there is no limitation of administering individual compounds. When a multiple treatment is carried out for one patient, each treatment may comprise an identical compound/combination, or different compounds/combinations, which can be determined by a doctor who provides the treatment depending on the outcome of the first/previous treatment. For example, in exemplary embodiment, a mixture of PRP and bFGF, and a mixture of plasma, bFGF, and PRP may be administered in this order for a first and a second treatment, respectively. Still in another exemplary embodiment, different agents, for example, a mixture of gel-type plasma+PRP+bFGF solution and a mixture of PRP+bFGF solution may be administered sequentially in this order during a single treatment. Step 6: Administer Anesthetic Procedure on the Patient Depending on the patient's condition and preference, different methods of anesthetics can be used, such as local anesthesia, nerve block, or general anesthesia. Step 7: Preparation of Target Area with Micro-Needle Therapy System (MTS) Sterilized micro-needle therapy system (MTS) stimulates skin regeneration in the treated areas. This is done by causing a slight controlled skin injury at a tolerable rate and stimulating repair of that area. The MTS promotes absorption of prepared mixtures and triggers the inflammation process. The MTS causes a slight controlled injury to the epidermis of the target area when the epidermis is penetrated repeatedly by micro-needles which trigger stimulation of collagen and elastin. Step 8: Inject the Target Area(s) Inject the target area with the following compounds in the following preferable sequence: (a) Gel-Type Plasma+PRP+bFGF solution [obtained from Step 5(a)](b) PRP+bFGF solution [obtained from Step 5(b)] The two injections are administered in sequence intradermally or subcutaneously onto the target site(s) by various injection tools in a safe and effective amount, for example, 0.1 μg to 50 μg or 1 μg to 100 μg of bFGF per cm2 of treatment area, not exceeding 1000 μg of bFGF administration a day. The amount can vary depending on the condition of hair loss and the patient's overall health. The listed sequence of administering the two injections is thought to be preferable. This step is relatively convenient because it requires approximately 20-180 minutes of injection administration time, which allows patients to immediately return to normal daily living the following day, including taking showers. Step 9: Repeat the Entire Process Preferably, the procedure described herein is repeated at least once a month (but no more than once a week), more preferably on a monthly basis for at least 3 months, and most preferably for longer period of time, for example, for about 1 year. Frequency of injection can be varied and multiple procedures can be done. Use of bFGF in treating skin aging and wrinkle skin is known in the art, for example in U.S. Pat. No. 8,518,878 and various causes and symptoms of hair loss or hair thinning are known in the art, for example in US Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0322882, which are incorporated in their entities by reference herein, where appropriate. The agent of the present disclosure may be used for treating various hair loss disorders including, but not limited to, alopecia greata, telogen effluvium, anagen effluvium, cicatricial, alopecia, scarring alopecia, scalp thinning; hair shaft abnormalities such as trichorrexis nodosa, loose anagen syndrome, trichotillomania, and traction alopecia; infectious hair disorders such as tiniea capitis, sebohorreic dermatitis, and follicullitus of the scalp; genetic disorders such as androgenic alopecia, and patients undergoing hair loss due to chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal imbalance (e.g., thyroid conditions such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, pregnancy, child birth, discontinuation of birth control pills and changes in menstrual cycle), fungal infection of the scalp such as ringworm, medicines causing hair loss such as anticoagulants, medicine for gout, depression, high blood pressure, and certain heart medications. The agent may also be used to treat hair loss related to environmental factors and chemicals used in hair treatment (dying, tinting and bleaching). The agent of the present disclosure may be used to treat hair loss related to other diseases such as diabetes, lupus, and poor nutrition, mental/physical stress such as due to surgery, illness, and high fever. Preferably, the agent of the present disclosure is administered to a target area of the body multiple times at a certain interval of, for example 2-6 weeks, or 3-5 weeks. In an aspect, the agent may be administered at least once a month (but no more than once a week), more preferably on a monthly basis for at least 3 months, and most preferably for longer period of time, for example, for about 1 year. The agent of the present disclosure may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. bFGF used in the present disclosure may be formulated into an appropriate formulation following a common method. The formulation may be a solid formulation such as powder and granule. However, from the viewpoint of obtaining a superior efficiency for preventing and treating hair loss, it may be preferably formulated into a liquid agent for injection such as a solution agent, emulsion, suspension agent, or into a gelling agent for injection. As a method for producing the liquid agent, for example, a method comprising mixing bFGF with a solvent, and a method comprising further mixing bFGF with a suspending agent, or emulsifying agent can be preferably exemplified. As a method for producing the gelling agent, for example, a method of mixing bFGF with gelatin can be preferably exemplified. When formulating bFGF of the present disclosure into a formulation, an appropriate pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, e.g., any component such as excipient, binding agent, solvent, solubilizing agent, suspending agent, emulsifying agent, tonicity agent, buffering agent, stabilizing agent, soothing agent, antiseptic agent, antioxidant agent, coloring agent, may be compounded to suit the needs in formulation.

Examples of substances having or expected to have the above effect preferably include one or more selected from the group consisting of morphogens such as fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10), acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VGEF), insulin-like growth factor (ILGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), etc. By administering those substances intradermally or subcutaneously in addition to the agent for preventing and treating hair loss, they may be used in combination with the agent for preventing and treating hair loss. The method of administering the agent for preventing and treating hair loss of the present disclosure intradermally or subcutaneously is not particularly limited as long as it is a method for administering the agent intradermally or subcutaneously to the site of hair loss, or surrounding part thereof, being the target of prevention or treatment. As used herein, the following terms are defined as follows. “Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor” and “bFGF” is a biopharmaceutical product that is widely available in commercial markets and used for treating many skin disorders and used as wound healing agent, e.g., bFGF commercial product “Trafermin” from Daewoong Pharmaceutical, Co., Ltd, the Republic of Korea, one of the distributor of Kaken Pharmaceutical, Co., LTD., etc. As long as it has an effect on preventing and treating hair loss of the present disclosure, the aspect of bFGF may be any of a naturally occurring type- or genetically modified type-bFGF, or a precursor protein thereof; a protein wherein one or more constituent amino acids of the naturally occurring type- or genetically modified type-bFGF have been substituted, deleted, or inserted; a protein encoded by a cDNA that can hybridize under stringent conditions (65° C., 1×SSC, 0.1% SDS or 0.1×SSC, 0.1% SDS) to a naturally occurring type-human bFGF; a protein having a homology of 75% or more, preferably 80% or more, more preferably 85% or more, further preferably 90% or more, and further more preferably 95% or more to the naturally occurring type-human bFGF cDNA. Further, it may be a nucleic acid encoding a gene of each protein (cDNA or cDNA plasmid; hereinafter sometimes referred to as “gene” as a whole). The genes can be administered as a single plasmid, or in a form of a complex plasmid in which liposome, etc. are combined with an expression vector. “Plasma” means the top liquid portion of blood, when centrifuged, obtained from blood withdraw from the patient who wishes to prevent and treat his/her own hair loss—a protein-salt solution in which red and white blood cells and platelets are suspended. Plasma, which is 92 percent water, constitutes 55 percent of blood volume. Plasma contains albumin (the chief protein constituent), fibrinogen (responsible, in part, for the clotting of blood), and globulins (including antibodies). Plasma serves a variety of functions, from maintaining a satisfactory blood pressure and volume to supplying critical proteins for blood clotting and immunity. It also serves as the medium for exchange of vital minerals such as sodium and potassium and helps to maintain a proper pH (acid-base) balance in the body, which is critical to cell function. Plasma is obtained by separating the liquid portion of blood from the cells. “Platelet Rich Plasma” and “PRP” means the blood mid portion of blood when centrifuged, obtained from blood withdraw from the patient who wishes to prevent and treat his/her own hair loss, being blood plasma that has been enriched with platelets. As a concentrated source of autologous platelets, PRP contains several different growth factors and other cytokines that stimulate healing of bone and soft tissue. “Gel-Type Plasma” means the resulting product when Plasma has been submerged in sterilized polypropylene container in safe and effective temperature for specified time to make gelatinous form for better retention when the solution is injected onto the target skin area. It may be created using Step 3 mentioned in Example below. “bFGF Solution” means the resulting product when freeze-dried commercially purchased bFGF is dissolved into saline solution, benzalkonium chloride or similar solvent. It may be created using Step 4 mentioned in Example below. “PRP and bFGF Solution” means the resulting product when PRP is mixed with bFGF solution. It may be created using Step 5(b) mentioned in Example below. “Anesthetic” means local anesthesia, nerve block, or general anesthesia in the procedure that is the practice of administering medications either by injection or by inhalation (breathing-in) that block the feeling of pain and other sensations, or that produce a deep state of unconsciousness that eliminates all sensations, which allows medical and surgical procedures to be undertaken without causing undue distress or discomfort. “Clinical research” means the treatments conducted by the inventor at a clinic in confidential manner as detailed in the Cases below, which confirmed the effect of hair growth with the Agent. “Intradermal” means administering an agent (preferably by injection) into dermal tissue of the skin. “Subcutaneous” means administering an agent (preferably by injection) into adipose tissue under the skin. “Hair” means scalp, head, facial and/or body hair, including but not limited to the scalp, eye lashes, brows, mustache, beard, ear, nasal, chest, pubic, auxiliary, and the like. “Hair growth” means earlier inducing growth of a new hair cycle, prolonging the active growth phase (anagen) of the hair cycle, increasing the growth rate of the hair, and/or increasing the width of hair shaft, including, but not limited to, the induction of the growth of hair and making it more visible to the eye. “Hair Loss” and “Hair Thinning” means a decrease in normal hair density and/or shortening of the normal growth phase (anagen) of the hair cycle and/or reduction of the width of hair shaft, and reduction of the number of hairs, which may be caused by age increase, genetically predisposed and/or other causes, and may be suffered by male or female, young or old. The term “promote hair growth” or “treatment” used herein is intended to mean at least one of the results of an increase in number and/or length and/or thickness of hair on at least part of the treated skin (or scalp) surface. “Prevent” and “Preventing” as used herein concerning hair loss or hair thinning means an effect on decreasing any hair loss or hair thinning in advance. “Procedure” means a series of steps that is outlined in the Example titled “Methodology and Steps,” including collecting blood and separating blood; making and using certain solutions that include bFGF, preparing the patient and target area with anesthetics and micro-needle therapy system, and intradermal and subcutaneous injection of the target area. “Safe and Effective Amount” means an amount sufficient that the Agent can provide the hair growth stimulation effect at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio attendant with any medical treatment. Within the scope of sound medical judgment, the amount and proportion of active ingredients used can vary with the particular condition being treated, the severity of the condition, the cause of the condition, the duration of the treatment, the specific active ingredient employed, its concentration, the specific vehicle utilized, the general health of the patient, the tolerance of the patient to various effects of the administration, other drugs being administered to the patient, and like factors within the specific knowledge and expertise of the patient or attending physician. Further, the present disclosure also encompasses the use of bFGF in the manufacture of an agent for preventing and treating hair loss; a method for using bFGF in an agent for preventing and treating hair loss; the use of bFGF in the prevention and treatment of hair loss; a method for preventing and treating hair loss comprising administering intradermally or subcutaneously bFGF to mammals (particularly human); a method of making a mixture of bFGF with other substances, such as PRP and/or Plasma for such purpose.
