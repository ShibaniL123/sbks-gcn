Intermediate 10: 2-(Difluoromethyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine
To a suspension of Cs2CO3 (600 mg, 1.84 mmol) in DMF (1.5 mL) were added 5-(trifluoromethyl)-3a,7a-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine (Intermediate 8, 100 mg, 0.534 mmol) and sodium chlorodifluoroacetate (245 mg, 1.61 mmol) The reaction mixture was stirred at 95° C. for 1 h and then allowed to cool to rt. To the mixture was added water (10 mL) and the layers were separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (2×5 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water (1×5 mL) and brine (1×4 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (SiO2; 100% toluene) to give the title compound (11 mg, 8% yield) as a white crystalline solid.
