Solid-stabilized emulsion Description The present invention relates to an emulsion comprising: a) water, b) at least one crude oil and c) at least one layered double hydroxide of general formula (I), whereby the layered double hydroxide of general formula (I) is present in the form of solid particles. The present invention further relates to a process for the preparation of the emulsion and the use of the same. Emulsions are known in the art and are commonly referred to as oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions. Emulsions generally have a limited stability, i.e. limited storage life time or shelf life time, and segregate or separate upon prolonged storage, and/or show rapid droplet growth or droplet size increase. Oil-in-water emulsions have become important in the petroleum industry as a displacing fluid for enhanced oil recovery. When used as a displacing fluid, an emulsion is pumped into a wellbore and displaces oil in subterranean formations. However, an alternative approach to increase the amount of extracted oil would be to form an emulsion in situ in the subterranean formation. These emulsions should have a low viscosity and show high stability even at elevated tempera- tures in order to allow for easy recovery from the subterranean formation by pumping. US 6,988,550 discloses a method to prepare an oil-in-water emulsion in a subterranean formation in the presence of hydrophilic particles such as bentonite clay and kaolinite clay both of which comprise negatively charged layers and cations in the interlayer spaces. Wang et al. (Langmuir 2008, 24, pages 10054 - 10061 ) disclose double phase inversion of emulsions containing layered double hydroxide particles induced by adsorption of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Therefore a liquid paraffin-water emulsion was investigated using layered double hydroxide (LDH) particles and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as emulsifiers. Both emulsifiers are well-known to stabilize oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions. A double phase inversion of the emulsion containing LDH particles is induced by the adsorption of SDS. Zhe An et al. (Chemical Communications, 2013, vol. 49, pages 5912 - 5920) disclose layered double hydroxide-based catalysts with nanostructure design and catalytic performance. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a class of clays with brucite-like layers and intercalated anions which have attracted increasing interest in the field of catalysis. Benefiting from the atomic-scale uniform distribution of metal cations in the brucite-like layers and the ability to intercalate a diverse range of interlayer anions, LDHs display great potential as precursors/supports to prepare catalysts, in that the catalytic sites can be preferentially orientated, highly dispersed, and firmly stabilized to afford excellent catalytic performance and recyclability. US 2003/0139299 A1 discloses a solids-stabilized oil-in-water emulsion and a method for preparing the same. The oil-in-water emulsion is formed by combining oil, water, solid particles and a pH enhancing agent and mixing until the solid-stabilized oil-in-water emulsion is formed. The low viscosity oil-in-water emulsion can be used to enhance production of oil from subterranean reservoirs. Han et al. (Colloid Polym Sci 274: 860 - 865 (1996)) disclose a study on the preparation and structure of positive sol composed of mixed metal hydroxide. Han et al. disclose the preparation of mixed metal hydroxide (MMH) positive sol by using the precipitation method. Abend et al. (Colloid Polym Sci, 276: pages 730 - 737 (1998)) disclose a stabilization of emul- sions by heterocoagulation of clay minerals and layered double hydroxides. The paraffin/water emulsions were stabilized by colloidal particles without surface active agents. Mixtures of two types of particles with opposite signs of charge were used: a layered double hydroxide (the hydroxide layers carry positive charges) and the clay mineral montmorillonite (the silicate layers carry negative charges). The emulsions were very stable and did not separate a coherent oil phase. The stability of the emulsion (no oil coalescence after centrifugation) was independent of the mixing ratio of both the compounds when the total solid content was > 0.5%. Solid contents up to 2.0% were optimal. Yang et al. (Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 302 (2006) pages 159 - 169) disclose pickering emulsions stabilized solely by a layered double hydroxides particles and the effect of salt on emulsion formation and stability. The formation and stability of liquid paraffin-in-water emulsions stabilized solely by positively charged plate-like layered double hydroxides (LDHs) particles were described here. The effects of adding salt into LDHs dispersions on particle zeta potential, particle contact angle, particle adsorption at the oil-water interface and the structure strength of dispersions were studied. It was found that the zeta potential of particles gradually decreased with the increase of salt concentration, but the variation of contact angle with salt concentration was very small. The adsorption of particles at the oil-water interface occurred due to the reduction of particle zeta potential. The structural strength of LDHs dispersions was strengthened with the increase of salt and particle concentrations. Wang et al. (Langmuir 2010, 26(8), pages 5397 - 5404) disclose pickering emulsions stabilized by a lipophilic surfactant and hydrophilic platelike particles. Liquid paraffin-water emulsions were prepared by homogenizing oil phases containing sorbitan oleate (Span 80) and aqueous phases containing layered double hydroxide (LDH) particles or Laponite particles. While water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions are obtained by combining LDH with Span 80, the emulsions stabilized by Lap- onite-Span 80 are always o/w types regardless of the Span 80 concentration. Laser-induced fluorescent confocal micrographs indicate that particles are absorbed on the emulsion surfaces, suggesting all the emulsions are stabilized by the particles. EP 0 558 089 A1 discloses sunscreen formulations comprising water, oil and layered double hydroxides. Thus, there is a need to provide an emulsion that shows high stability, even at higher temperatures such as temperatures in the range of 30 - 300°C. The object of the present invention is achieved by an emulsion comprising: a) water, b) at least one oil and c) at least one layered double hydroxide of general formula (I) wherein M" denotes a divalent metal ion or 2 Li, Mm denotes a trivalent metal ion, An- denotes at least one n-valent anion comprising: (i) a mixture of A1 and A2, or (ii) A1 , whereby A1 is selected from the group consisting of alkyi sulfate, alkyi phosphate, alkyi sulfonate, alkyi phosphanate, alkyi phosphinate and alkyi carbonate, and A2 is selected from the group consisting of H-, P, Ch, Br, I-, OH", CN-, N03", N02-, CIO", CIO2-, CIO3-, CIO4-, Μη04-, CH3COO-, HCO3-, H2PO4-, HSO4-, HS-, SCN-, [AI(OH)4]-, [AI(OH)4(H20)2]-, [Ag(CN)2]-, [Cr(OH)4]-, [AuCI4]-, O2", S2", 022", SOs2", S2032-, Cr042", Cr2072-, HP042-, [Zn(OH)4]2-, [Zn(CN)4]2-, [CuCI4]2", P043", [Fe(CN)6]3-, [Ag(S203)2]3-, [Fe(CN)6]4-, CO32-, S042" and Se042-, whereby the ratio of the mixture of A1 and A2 is 1 mol [trivalent metal ion Mm] = ( 1 mol [A1] / valence of A1 ) + ( 1 mol [A2] / valence of A2), n is 1 to 4, x is the mole fraction having a value ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 and y is a value ranging from 0 to 5.0, whereby the layered double hydroxide of general formula (I) is present in the form of solid particles. The object of the present invention is achieved by an emulsion comprising: a) water, b) at least one oil and c) at least one layered double hydroxide of general formula (I) [M''(i-X)M'''x(OH)2]><+[A"-]x/n . y H20 (I), wherein M" denotes a divalent metal ion or 2 Li, Mm denotes a trivalent metal ion, An- denotes at least one n-valent anion comprising: (i) a mixture of A1 and A2, or (ii) A1 , whereby A1 is selected from the group consisting of alkyi sulfate, alkyi phosphate, alkyi sulfonate, alkyi phosphonate, alkyi phosphinate and alkyi carbonate, and A2 is selected from the group consisting of COO", C2042-, H-, F-, Ch, Br, I-, OH", CN-, Ν03", Ν02-, CIO", CI02-, CIOs", CIO4-, Μη04-, CHsCOO", HCOs", Η2Ρ04-, HS04-, HS", SCN-, [AI(OH)4]-, [AI(OH)4(H20)2]-, [Ag(CN)2]-, [Cr(OH)4]", [AuCU]", O2", S2", 022", SOs2", S20s2-, Cr042-, Cr2072-, ΗΡ042", [Zn(OH)4]2-, [Zn(CN)4]2-, [CuCU]2", Ρ043", [Fe(CN)6]3-, [Ag(S203)2]3-, [Fe(CN)6]4-, CO32-, S042" and Se042-, whereby the ratio of the mixture of A1 and A2 is 1 mol [trivalent metal ion Mm] = ( 1 mol [A1] / valence of A1 ) + ( 1 mol [A2] / valence of A2), n is 1 to 4, x is the mole fraction having a value ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 and y is a value ranging from 0 to 5.0, whereby the layered double hydroxide of general formula (I) is present in the form of solid particles. The object of the present invention is achieved by an emulsion comprising water, at least one crude oil and at least one layered double hydroxide of general formula (I) wherein M" denotes a divalent metal ion or 2 Li, Mm denotes a trivalent metal ion, An- denotes at least one n-valent anion comprising: (i) a mixture of A1 and A2, or (ii) A1 , whereby A1 is selected from the group consisting of alkyi sulfate, alkyi phosphate, alkyi sulfonate, alkyi phosphonate, alkyi phosphinate and alkyi carbonate, and A2 is selected from the group consisting of COO", C2042-, H-, F-, Ch, Br, I-, OH", CN-, NO3-, NO2-, CIO", CIO2-, CIOs", CIO4-, Μη04-, CH3COO-, HCOs", Η2Ρ04-, HSCv, HS", SCN-, [AI(OH)4]-, [AI(OH)4(H20)2]-, [Ag(CN)2]-, [Cr(OH)4]", [AuCU]", O2", S2", 022", SOs2", S20s2-, Cr042-, Cr2072-, HP042-, [Zn(OH)4]2-, [Zn(CN)4]2-, [CuCI4]2", P043", [Fe(CN)6]3-, [Ag(S203)2]3-, [Fe(CN)6]4-, COs2", S042" and Se042-, whereby the ratio of the mixture of A1 and A2 is 1 mol [trivalent metal ion Mm] = ( 1 mol [A1] / valence of A1 ) + ( 1 mol [A2] / valence of A2), n is 1 to 4, x is the mole fraction having a value ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 and y is a value ranging from 0 to 5.0, whereby the layered double hydroxide of general formula (I) is present in the form of solid particles. The term "stability" or "stabilized" refers to the period up to incipient separation, and in which the emulsion does not visually show segregation, such as the formation of a visible bottom layer of water and/or a visible top layer of oil. The term "valence" refers to the charge of A1 or A2. For example, the valence of CH3COO" is -1 . For evaluating the stability, as used in this invention, a test method is to be used wherein a sample of 100 g of emulsion is stored in a test tube with an inner diameter of 2.5 cm and sufficient length. The tube is stored at a selected temperature and monitored over time for separation to occur, i.e. for formation of a top or bottom layer. The stability is then the time elapsing between filling the test tube and the observation of the separation phenomenon. The temperature is to be chosen such that it is above the melting temperature of the compound in the emulsions with the highest melting temperature, and below the boiling temperature of the lowest boiling compound of the emulsion. Suitably it is chosen between 30 °C and 300 °C. The solid particles can arrange themselves at positions on the oil/water interface in a manner to prevent droplet coalescence, thus forming a stable emulsion. Preferably, the inventive emulsion shows a stability of 1 to 30 days at a temperature in the range of 30 to 200°C, more preferably a stability of 5 to 20 days at a temperature in the range of 30 to 200°C. It is noted that WO 2009/87199 A1 discloses emulsions that contain oil, water and solid particles. However, these emulsions require the presence of surfactants in order to achieve sufficient stability of the emulsion. The use of surfactants is usually costly, because they cannot be recovered from the emulsion and subsequently be used again. Therefore, it would be very much appreciated if emulsions were provided that do not contain surfactants so that the solid particles can be recovered without any difficulty. Hence, it is another object of the presently claimed invention to provide emulsions that show a high stability, even at higher temperatures such as temperatures in the range of 30 - 200°C. An alkyl (for A"-) can be a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted Ci-C2o-alkyl optionally interrupted by at least one heteroatom, at least partly halogenated, and/or at least partly hy- droxylated, a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted C4-Cis-alkyl optionally interrupted by at least one heteroatom, a substituted or unsubstituted C3-C2o-cycloalkyl optionally attached via a linear or branched Ci-C2o-alkyl chain, a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted, at least monounsaturated C2-C2o-alkenyl optionally interrupted by at least one heteroatom. Heteroatoms usable in accordance with the invention are selected from N, O, P and S. Preferably an alkyl is a linear or branched, substituted or unsubstituted Ci-C2o-alkyl, more preferably Cs-Cis-alkyl chain. In particular, an alkyl is a linear, unsubstituted Ci4-Ci8-alkyl, more particularly a linear, unsubstituted Ci6-alkyl. An emulsion according to the present invention is a heterogeneous liquid system involving two immiscible phases, with one of the phases being intimately dispersed in the form of droplets in the second phase. The matrix of an emulsion is called the external or continuous phase, while the portion of the emulsion that is in the form of droplets is called the internal, dispersed or discontinuous phase. An emulsion according to the present invention can also be denoted as a fluid colloidal system in which liquid droplets and/or liquid crystals are dispersed in a liquid. The droplets often exceed the usual limits for colloids in size. An emulsion is denoted by the symbol O/W (or o/w), if the continuous phase is an aqueous solution and by W/O or (w/o), if the continuous phase is an organic liquid (an "oil"). More complicated emulsions such as 0/W/O (i. e. oil droplets contained within aqueous droplets dispersed in the continuous oil phase) are also possible. Preferably, the inventive emulsion is an o/w emulsion. Apart from the conventional emulsions in which surface-active substances stabilize the emul- sion, it is also possible to stabilize emulsion by solids. These solid stabilized emulsions are characterized by the stabilization of the phase boundary with the help of (nano)particulate solid particles. These solids are not surface-active but form a mechanical barrier around the droplets of the internal phase and thus prevent their coales- cence. In contrast to conventional emulsions, the use of emulsifiers is normally not necessary. According to the lUPAC definition, emulsifiers are surfactants that stabilize emulsions by lowering the rate of aggregation and/or coalescence of the emulsions. Surface-active substances are located primarily in the interface between the oil and water phase to lower the interfacial ten- sion. The term "solid" means a substance in its most highly concentrated form, i.e., the atoms or molecules comprising the substance are more closely packed with one another relative to the liquid or gaseous states of the substance. The "particle" of the present invention can have any shape, for example a spherical, cylindrical, a circular or cuboidal shape. "Oil" means a fluid containing a mixture of condensable hydrocarbons of more than 90 wt.-%, preferably of more than 99 wt.-%. In particular "oil" can be defined as a mixture consisting of condensable hydrocarbons. "Hydrocarbons" are organic material with molecular structures containing carbon and hydrogen. Hydrocarbons may also include other elements, such as, but not limited to, halogens, metallic elements, nitrogen, oxygen, and/or sulfur. A "mixture of A1 and A2" means that at least an anion A1 and an anion A2 are present in the at least one layered double hydroxide of general formula (I) (LDH). A1 and A2 are separate anions in the LDH, which can replace each other in the interlayer region of the LDH. In other words, the LDH can have two different anions located in the interlayer region. Preferably, An_ denotes two anions. In order to maintain charge balance, the sum of the molar number of A1 divided by the valence of A1 and the molar number of A2 divided by the valence of A2 should be same as the molar number of trivalent metal ion, i.e. the ratio of the mixture of A1 and A2 is 1 mol [trivalent metal ion M'"] = (1 mol [A1 ] / valence of A1 ) + ( 1 mol [A2] / valence of A2). Preferably the oils or hydrocarbons are selected from the group consisting of crude oil, straight and branched chain hydrocarbons having from 7 to 40 carbon atoms such as dodecane, isodo- decane, squalane, cholesterol, hydrogenated polyisobutylene, isododecosane, hexadecane; Ci- C30 alcohol esters of C1-C30 carboxylic acids and of C1-C30 dicarboxylic acids such as isononyl isononanoate, methyl isostearate, ethyl isostearate, diisoproyl sebacate, diisopropyl adipate, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, methyl palmitate, myristyl propionate, 2-ethylhexyl pal- mitate, isodecyl neopentanoate, di(2-ethylhexyl) maleate, cetyl palmitate, cetyl stearate, methyl stearate, isopropyl stearate, and behenyl behenate; mono-, di-, and tri-glycerides of C1-C30 carboxylic acids such as caprylic/capric triglyceride, PEG-6 caprylic/capric triglyceride, and PEG-8 caprylic/capric triglyceride; alkylene glycol esters of C1-C30 carboxylic acids including ethylene glycol mono- and diesters of C1-C30 carboxylic acids and propylene glycol mono- and diesters of C1-C30 carboxylic acids such as ethylene glycol distearate; C1-C30 mono- and polyesters of sugars and related materials such as glucose tetraoleate; and organopolysiloxane oils such as polyalkyi siloxanes, cyclic polyalkyi siloxanes, and polyalkylaryl siloxanes. It is also contemplated to use propoxylated or ethoxylated forms of the above-exemplified oils. It is further envisaged to use two or more oils as the oil component in the emulsion of the invention. It is further envisaged to use two or more crude oils as the crude oil component in the emulsion of the invention.

Layered double hydroxides of general formula (I) (LDH) comprise an unusual class of layered materials with positively charged layers and charge balancing anions located in the interlayer region. This is unusual in solid state chemistry: many more families of materials have negatively charged layers and cations in the interlayer spaces (e.g. kaolinite, Al2Si205(OH)4). The layered double hydroxide (LDH) of general formula (I) according to the present invention can be obtained by the reaction of a layered double hydroxide of general formula (IA) and the salt of an alkyl sulfate, alkyl phosphate, alkyl sulfonate, alkyl carboxylate, alkyl phosphonate, alkyl phosphinate and alkyl carbonate, whereby the cation is selected from alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and rare earth metals or mixtures thereof.

In particular, the solid particles are delaminated at a temperature in the range from 60°C to 80°C for 15 h to 25 h. Delamination means to separate the two layers of an LDH into two separate layers.

Most preferably the oil is crude oil having an API gravity in the range between 20 °API and 40 °API. Such oils, by nature of their composition, usually contain asphaltenes and polar hydrocarbons.

Preferably, the particles have an average particle size in the range of 30 nm to 2 μηη and more preferably in the range of 50 nm to 100 nm, determined according to SEM images (as defined under Method A).

Preferably, the solid particles are hydrophilic for making an oil-in-water emulsion. Thereby, the particles are properly wetted by the continuous phase, i. e. water that holds the discontinuous phase. The appropriate hydrophilic character may be an inherent characteristic of the solid particles or either enhanced or acquired by treatment of the solid particles. In the scope of the present invention, "hydrophilic" means that the surface of a corresponding "hydrophilic" solid particle has a contact angle with water against air of < 90°. The contact angle is determined according to methods that are known to the skilled artisan, for example using a standard-instrument (Dropshape Analysis Instrument, Fa. Kruss DAS 10). A shadow image of the droplet is taken using a CCD-camera, and the shape of the droplet is acquired by computer aided image analysis. These measurements are conducted according to DIN 5560-2.

The conductivity is a measure of the level of ion concentration of a solution. The more salts, acids or bases are dissociated, the greater the conductivity of the solution. In water or waste water it is mainly a matter of the ions of dissolved salts, and consequently the conductivity is an index of the salt load in water. The measurement of conductivity is generally expressed in S/cm (or mS/cm) which is the product of the conductance of the test solution and the geometric factor of the measuring cell. Conductivity can be measured using a variety of commercially available test instruments such as the Waterproof PC 300 hand-held meter made by Eutech Instru- ments/Oakton Instruments.

It should be understood that the foregoing is illustrative only and that other means and techniques can be employed without departing from the true scope of the invention claimed herein. Examples Methods Emulsion characterization Type The type of emulsion (oil in water type or water in oil type) was determined by conductivity measurement. After 24 hours from making an emulsion, the conductivity of emulsion was measured with a conductivity meter (LF330, Wissenschaftlich-Technische Werkstatten GmbH). When conductivity of an emulsion is more than 10 με / cm, it indicates that the emulsion is oil in water type. When conductivity of an emulsion is less than 10 με / cm, it indicates that the emulsion is water in oil type (Langmuir 2012, 28, 6769-6775). Droplet Size Droplet size of emulsion was measured by the laser diffraction in accordance to ISO13320: 2010-01. The value of Dv5o was used for comparison. N2 adsorption desorption isotherms: Langmuir surface areas, BET surface areas, micropore volume, pore volume, micropore size were measured via nitrogen adsorption at 77 K according to DIN 66131 : 1993-06 (BET) and DIN 66135-1 : 2001 -06 (N2 adsorption). The micropore volume was determined from the t-plot analysis. X-ray powder diffraction: The determinations of the crystallinities were performed on a D8 Advance series 2 diffractometer from Bruker AXS. The diffractometer was configured with an opening of the divergence aperture of 0.1 0 and a Lynxeye detector. The samples were measured in the range from 2 0 to 70 0 (2 Theta). After baseline 30 correction, the reflecting surfaces were determined by making use of the evaluation software EVA (from Bruker AXS). The ratios of the reflecting surfaces are given as percentage values. SEM Powder samples were investigated with the field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) Hitachi S-4700, which was typically run at acceleration voltages between 2kV and 20kV. Powder samples were prepared on a standard SEM stub and sputter coated with a thin platinum layer, typically 5nm. The sputter coater was the Polaron SC7640. The sizes of LDH particles, diameter and thickness, were counted manually from SEM images. 50 particles were picked up randomly, and their sizes were measured. The averages were defined by the particle sizes. Aspect ratio was determined as the ratio of diameter/thickness. Elemental Analysis Composition of the obtained materials is measured with flame atomic absorption spectrometry (F-AAS) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). AFM The heights of the particles are measured with atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM measurement was performed on Bruker ICON Peak Force Mapping at 1 nN. Bruker MPP-12120- 10 Model TAP150A was used as a cantilever. Scan frequency was 0.3Hz. Typically, 5mg of powder was dispersed in 8ml of EtOH (dry, Aldrich) with 10 minutes of ultrasonic sound. Then the suspension was dropped onto a freshly cleaved Mica surface and dried under vacuum at room temperature. FT-IR analysis The functional groups of samples are observed with FT-IR. The FT-IR measurements were performed on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer with KBr method. Typically, 1 mg of sample and 300 mg of KBr were mixed and grinded in agate mortar, and the mixture was press with 80 kN. The spectra were recorded in the range of 4000 cm-1 to 400 cm-1 at a resolution of 2 cm-1. The obtained spectra were represented by a plot having on the x axis the wavenumber (cm-1) and on the y axis the absorbance (arbitrary units).

Stability and permeability of the emulsions Sand-packed column experiments Flow of the emulsion through porous media, i.e. sandstone or packed sand is essential for practical application. The following experiments allow us to examine the permeability of the obtained emulsion. A cylinder with height of 200 mm and diameter of 15 mm was used for a vessel. Sand provided by Wintershall (Well: Bockstedt-83) was put into the cylinder until its height be 100 mm. The sand was not pretreated with water and/or oil. After that, 50 ml of emulsion was poured into the cylinder with 20 ml/min. The amounts of emulsion which went through the sand and droplet size of the emulsion were used as a measure of the ability of the emulsion to flow through the packed column without destruction of the emulsion. Example 1 (comparative) The sand-packed column experiment was carried out with emulsion 1 as described above. 31 .4 % of the emulsion was recollected after passing through the column. Example 2 The sand-packed column experiment was carried out with emulsion 2 as described above. 73.5 % of the emulsion was recollected after passing through the column.
