BACKGROUND The invention relates to a bone anchoring device for anchoring a stabilization rod in a bone or in a vertebra. The bone anchoring device includes an anchoring element and a receiving part for receiving a head of the bone anchoring element and for receiving a stabilization rod to be connected to the anchoring element. The anchoring element is pivotably connected to the receiving part and can be fixed at an angle by exerting pressure onto the head via a pressure element that is arranged in the receiving part. The pressure element and the receiving part have recesses and projections that are configured to cooperate in such a way that the pressure element can assume a position within the receiving part in which it clamps the head by friction without locking it. U.S. Pat. No. 5,716,356 describes a polyaxial bone screw including a screw element, a receiving part that is pivotably connected to the screw element, and a pressure element to exert pressure onto the head of the screw element to fix the angle between the screw element and the receiving part. The receiving part has a U-shaped channel for receiving a stabilization rod. The pressure element comprises a cylindrical recess that is to be aligned with the U-shaped channel to receive the rod therein. In order to hold the pressure element in a position aligned with the U-shaped channel, the position of the pressure element is fixed by crimping through bores provided in the receiving part. U.S. Pat. No. 5,672,176 describes another example of a polyaxial bone screw with a pressure element that is also held in place by crimp bores without impeding a sufficient movement of the pressure element to clamp the head. The receiving part has a tapering inner surface portion and the pressure element has a correspondingly tapering outer surface in a region laterally surrounding said screw head. By the cooperating tapering surfaces, the head can be locked while still allowing adjustments of the position of the rod. WO 2006/116437 A2 describes a bone anchor for spinal fixation in the form of a polyaxial bone screw including screw element, a housing, a sleeve and a collet arranged in the housing for exerting pressure onto the head of the screw element. The sleeve has retention tabs that snap into slots in opposite wall portions of the housing. If the head of the anchoring element is freely pivotable with respect to the receiving part, the alignment of the receiving part and the insertion of the rod may be difficult in more complex clinical applications, for example, when a multitude of bone anchors have to be connected to the rod. U.S. Pat. No. 7,604,656 describes a fastener engageable with a bone portion to connect a longitudinal member to the bone portion. The housing that receives the fastener also receives a spacer that is engageable with the fastener and the longitudinal member. In one embodiment the spacer is urged by a pin member into frictional engagement with the fastener and with the housing. SUMMARY It is an object of the invention to provide a bone anchoring device that allows for an improved handling during surgery and that can be manufactured in a simple manner. With the bone anchoring device, a temporary clamping of the head in an appropriate angular position with respect to the receiving part without locking the head can be achieved. This allows the receiving part to be held in an adjustable angular position. In this position the pressure element exerts a preload onto the head, in which the head is not locked but prevented from freely pivoting. When the head is temporarily clamped, the alignment of the receiving parts to the rod and the insertion of the rod are facilitated. Also, when the rod is already inserted into the receiving part, adjustments of the rod are still possible without completely loosening the head within the receiving part. Finally, the pressure element can be pressed onto the head to lock the head in its desired position. In addition, the bone anchoring device has only few parts, which are of simple design. The bone anchoring device must not necessarily be preassembled but can be assembled in any condition of the delivery after the parts have been manufactured and before the screw element is inserted into the bone. The pressure element can even be disassembled from the receiving part without having to apply large forces. Therefore, the assembling of the polyaxial bone screw can be carried out by any specialist, for example by the surgeon or any personnel assisting him or her before or during surgery. With the bone anchoring device, a modular system can be provided that allows the combination of various anchoring elements with any suitable receiving part, depending on the actual clinical requirements. This reduces the costs of polyaxial screws, reduces the inventory and gives the surgeon a substantial choice of implants. The receiving part and the pressure element can be manufactured in series at low costs. Further features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the description of embodiments by means of the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The bone anchoring device 1 according to an embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 includes a bone anchoring element in the form of a screw member 2 having a threaded shaft 3 and a head 4. The head 4 is, for example, shaped as a spherical segment. The head 4 has a recess 4′ at its free end for engagement with a tool (not shown). The bone anchoring device 1 further includes a receiving part 5 for connecting the screw member 2 to a rod 20. A pressure element 6 is arranged in the receiving part 5 on top of the head 4. For securing the rod 20 in the receiving part 5 and for exerting pressure onto the head 4, a locking device in the form of an inner screw 7 that cooperates with receiving part 5 is provided. The receiving part 5 as shown in particular in FIGS. 1 to 4 is substantially cylindrical and has a top end 51, a bottom end 52 and a coaxial bore 53 that is followed by a seat portion 54 for accommodating the head 4 of the screw member 2. At the seat portion 54 the bore narrows towards the bottom end 52. The seat portion 54 can be a spherically-shaped or tapered or can have any other shape that allows the accommodation of the head 4 so that the head 4 can pivot with respect to the receiving part 5. The receiving part 5 further has at the top end 51 a substantially U-shaped recess 55 by means of which two free legs 56, 57 form the side walls of a channel for receiving the rod 20. An internal thread 58 is provided at the legs 56, 57 for cooperating with the inner screw 7 of the locking device. The receiving part 5 further comprises at the inner wall of the bore 53, at a distance from the bottom end 52 that is smaller than the distance from the top end 51, two projections 59a, 59b, which are substantially tip-shaped and which project into the interior of the receiving part 5. The projections 59a, 59b are arranged at 180° offset from each other and at 90° with respect to the channel formed by the U-shaped recess 55. The projections 59a, 59b are manufactured, for example, by crimping using crimp bores 500a, 500b at the outside of the receiving part 5 in a manner described below. The receiving part 5 may have flat surface portions 501 at the outer side that extend into the legs 56, 57. The flat surface portions 501 may serve for engagement with a tool (not shown). The pressure element 6 is formed in one piece. It is of substantially cylindrical construction and has an outer diameter that allows it to move in the axial direction within the bore 53 of the receiving part 5. The pressure element 6 has a top end 61 and a bottom end 62. At the bottom end 62, which faces the head 4 of the screw element 2, a spherical recess 63 is provided that is adapted to the size of the head 4. At the top end 61, a cylindrical recess 64 configured to receive the rod 20 therein is provided. Further, the pressure element 6 has a coaxial bore 65 for allowing access to the screw head 4 with a tool (not shown). The pressure element 6 has two coaxially extending recesses in the form of notches 67a, 67b in its outer surface on both sides of the cylindrical recess 64. The notches are open towards the bottom end 62 and are closed at a distance from the bottom end 62. The notches 67a, 67b have a substantially V-shaped cross section and are inclined in such a way that the depth decreases in the direction towards the top end 61 as can be seen in particular in FIGS. 6, 7, 10 and 11. In a portion adjacent the bottom end 62, the notches 67a, 67b extend completely through the pressure element so as to form slits 68a, 68b that facilitate the engagement with the projections 59a, 59b of the receiving part. In a side view as can be seen in FIG. 6, the contour of the notches 67a, 67b at the outer surface of the pressure element 6 is triangular with a small acute angle towards the top end 61. The overall length of the notches 67a, 67b is, for example, approximately half of the height of the pressure element 6. The size of the projections 59a, 59b and their position in the receiving part 5 and the size of the notches 67a, 67b is such that the projections 59a, 59b accurately fit into the notches 67a, 67b when the pressure element 6 is inserted into the receiving part 5 and the projections engage the slits 68a, 68b and the lower portions of the notches 67a, 67b. The height of the projections 59a, 59b measured from the surface of the inner wall of the bore 53 is designed such that at a predefined first position P1, as shown in FIGS. 10 and 11, when the pressure element 6 is inserted into the receiving part 5, the projections 59a, 59b have a slight oversize with respect to the depth of the notches 67a, 67b. The position P1 is defined in such a way that the engagement between the projections 59a, 59b and the notches 67a, 67b provides an interference fit that holds the pressure element 6 in the position P1 such that it exerts a preload onto the head 4. By means of the preload exerted by the pressure element 6 onto the head 4, the head is prevented from freely pivoting within the receiving part but is not yet locked. In the position P1, the receiving part can be pivoted with respect to the head 4 by exerting an additional force by hand onto the receiving part. The projections 59a, 59b in the receiving part 5 are located, as can be seen in particular in FIG. 10, in the region of the upper portion of the head 4 when the screw member 2 is inserted into the receiving part 5. Furthermore, the notches 67a, 67b are formed in the outer wall of the pressure element 6 in the region that has the spherical recess 63. This ensures that at the position P1 the pressure element 6 can exert sufficient pressure for temporary clamping of the head 4. By selecting the position of the projections 59a, 59b, the size of the notches 67a, 67b, and the overall size of the pressure element 6 with respect to each other before the manufacture, the amount of preload exerted onto the head 4 can be defined. The receiving part 5 and the pressure element 6 are solid parts so that the cooperation between the projections 59a, 59b and the notches 67a, 67b is achieved without spring portions provided at the receiving part 5 or the pressure element 6. Both the receiving part 5 and the pressure element 6 are one-part elements having the projections 59a, 59b and the notches 67a, 67b, respectively, formed integrally therein. The arrangement of the projections 59a, 59b and of the notches 67a, 67b with respect to the channel axis of the U-shaped recess 55 of the receiving part 5 allows for correct alignment of the recess 64 of the pressure element 6 with respect to the U-shaped recess 55 of the receiving part 5 when inserting the pressure element 6 from the first end 61 into the receiving part 5. Further, the pressure element 6 is secured against rotation within the receiving part 5. The manufacturing of the projections 59a, 59b to achieve the predefined height is now described with reference to FIGS. 9a) to 9c). The receiving part 5 is first manufactured, for example in a conventional manner by cutting. Then, the crimp bores 500a, 500b are provided. As shown in FIG. 9b), crimping via crimping tools 502a, 502b is carried out to produce the projections 59a, 59b projecting into the interior of the receiving part 5. Thereafter, a calibration tool 503 is introduced into the receiving part 5 from the first end 51 as shown in FIG. 9c). The calibration tool 503 has an outer diameter that is selected such that the projections 59a, 59b that are formed initially by crimping are deformed so as to obtain the predefined height to be slightly oversized with respect to the depth of the notches 67a, 67b at the position P1. The assembly of the bone anchoring device 1 will now be explained with reference to FIGS. 12a) to 12d). First, as shown in FIG. 12a) the screw member 2 is introduced from the top end 51 into the bore 53 of the receiving part 5 until it rests in the seat 54 as shown in FIG. 12b). Then, as shown in FIG. 12c) the pressure element 6 is inserted from the top end 51 into the bore 53 of the receiving part 5. A tool (not shown) may be used for insertion and shifting down the pressure element 6. The orientation of the pressure element 6 within the receiving part 5 is such that the notches 67a, 67b and the projections 59a, 59b are aligned. When the pressure element 6 is shifted downwards, as shown in particular in FIG. 12d), the projections 59a, 59b engage the notches 67a, 67b so that the pressure element 6 is guided in the aligned orientation downwards. When the position P1 is reached, due to the slight oversize of the projections 59a, 59b with respect to the notches 67a, 67b, an interference fit between the projections 59a, 59b and the notches 67a, 67b is achieved. In this position P1 the pressure element 6 presses slightly onto the head 4 so that the head 4 can no longer freely pivot as possible before reaching the position P1. The head 4 is held by friction in the position P1. In the position P1, removal of the pressure element 6 is possible by exerting pressure on it from the bottom, for example, with the screw head 4, to loosen the interference fit between projections 59a, 59b and the notches 67a, 67b. The design of the bone anchoring device 1 allows for assembly and disassembly of the parts of the bone anchoring device in an easy manner. Therefore, the bone anchoring device 1 can be selectively assembled from different receiving parts and screw members at any time after the desired parts have been selected prior to the surgical insertion. All parts of the bone anchoring device 1 are made of a body-compatible material, such as a body-compatible metal, for example, titanium; body-compatible metal alloys such as, for example, Nitinol; or from a body-compatible plastic material, such as, for example, PEEK; or combinations thereof. In use, first, the bone anchoring device 1 is provided with the pressure element 6 being in the position P1 in which the head 4 is temporarily clamped. Usually several bone anchoring devices are necessary. The screw members are then screwed into the bone or a vertebra and then the receiving parts are pivoted by applying a force to overcome the clamping force until each receiving part has the correct orientation for the insertion of the rod. Due to the temporary clamping, the receiving part 5 is held in this angular position. The rod 20, which connects the bone anchoring devices, is inserted and the inner screw 7 is tightened to move the pressure element 6 downwards to lock the head 4 so that the angular position of the screw member 2 with respect to the receiving part 5 is fixed. The rod 20 is then fixed by the inner screw 7. Modifications of the previously described embodiment are conceivable. In a first modification, the notches have a substantially constant depth over their length. In this case, the interference fit between the notch and the projection is achieved over the length of the notch. The assembly and disassembly of the receiving part and the pressure element needs then larger forces. In a further modification, only one projection and one recess or notch is present. In a still further modification more than two projections and corresponding recesses are provided. In another modification the recess is provided at the receiving part and the projection is provided at the pressure element. In this modification, the recess is open toward the top end 51 and closed toward the bottom end 52 of the receiving part. For the anchoring element all kinds of anchoring elements can be used and combined with a receiving part. These anchoring elements are e.g. screws of different length, with different diameters, cannulated screws, screws with different thread forms, nails, etc. Various kinds of receiving parts can be used in particular such with different locking devices. For example, instead of the one-part locking device such as the inner screw that locks the rod and the head simultaneously, a two-part locking devices with an outer screw and an inner screw can be used. In this case the pressure element has a U-shaped recess with legs extending above the rod. With the two-part locking device the head and the rod can be fixed independently. Further, outer nuts, outer caps, bayonet locking devices or others are also possible. The shape of the receiving part is not limited to the embodiment shown. For example, the receiving part can have an asymmetric end portion for allowing a greater pivot angle of the screw member to one side. In a further modification, the receiving part is configured to allow the introduction of the screw element from the bottom end. 1.
