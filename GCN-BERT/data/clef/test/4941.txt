RELATED APPLICATIONS The present patent document claims the benefit of the filing date under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) of Provisional U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 61/952,534, filed Mar. 13, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND Compositions and methods for inhibition of triglyceride synthesis via synergistic combination of botanical extracts are described. Specifically, the following description relates to treating or preventing weight gain or obesity, promoting weight loss, appetite suppression, or the like, as well as managing skin oil production through a synergistic inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase-I (DGAT-I) enzyme involved in the triglyceride synthesis and modulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein Ic (SREBP-Ic) and/or peroxisome proliferator—activated receptor gamma coactivator I-alpha (PGCIα). DGAT-I is an enzyme that catalyzes the terminal step in mammalian triglyceride (fat) synthesis. DGAT-I functions during absorption and assimilation of dietary fat, and also in the deposition of fat in adipose tissue as well as other tissues, such as, e.g., sebaceous glands in the skin. SREBP-Ic is a transcription factor that belongs to a basic helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper transcription factor family, which also includes SREBP-Ia and SREBP2 (Brown and Goldstein, 1997, Cell 89, 331-340). Among the SREBP family of transcription factors, SREBP-Ic preferentially regulates genes involved in triglyceride and fatty acid synthesis, whereas SREBP-2 regulates genes related to cholesterol synthesis. PGCIα is a transcriptional coactivator that mediates many biological programs related to energy metabolism. Originally described as a coactivator of PPARγ that modulated expression of uncoupling protein I (UCPI) and thermogenesis in brown fat, it has also been shown to control mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism in many cell types. PGCIα is induced in muscle by exercise and stimulates many of the known beneficial effects of exercise in muscle: mitochondrial biogenesis, angiogenesis and fiber-type switching (Handschin and Spiegelman (2008) Nature 454, 463-469). It also provides resistance to muscular dystrophy and denervation-linked muscular atrophy (Sandri et al. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103, 16260-16265). The healthful benefits of elevated muscle expression of PGCIα may go beyond the muscle tissue itself. Transgenic mice with mildly elevated muscle PGCIα are dramatically resistant to age-related obesity and diabetes and have a prolonged life-span (Wenz et al. (2009) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 106, 20405-20410), which suggests that PGCIα might stimulate the secretion of factors from skeletal muscle that affects the health and function of other tissues and may relate to body weight management. A class of drugs called bile acid binding resins, e.g., cholestyramine, function to inhibit the absorption of dietary fat by formation of physical complexes with ingested fat, rendering the fat in complex form that is not absorbed by the body. Bile acid binding resins are prescribed for individuals that have difficulties with dietary fat effects on blood lipids and metabolism. However, the physical complexes formed between bile acid binding resins and dietary fat induce steatorrhea, an undesirable side effect. As such, improved compositions and methods for use in management of body weight as well as management of skin oil production, such as by inhibiting triglyceride synthesis or absorption are desirable.

Exemplary dietary supplements include one or more of a dietary ingredient such as a vitamin, a mineral, an herb or other botanical, an amino acid, or any other substance used to supplement the diet by increasing total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or any combination thereof. In certain embodiments, dietary supplements are a special category of food and are not a drug. The term “extract mixture” refers to a mixture or a combination of two or more different extracts. The extracts comprising the mixture may be at equivalent or different amounts or ratios. As used herein, the term “extract” refers to a solid, viscid, or liquid substance or preparation that includes an active ingredient of a substance of plant, such as whole grape, honeybush or grape seed in a concentrated form. The term “extract” is intended to include not only a crude extract produced from whole grape, honeybush and/or grape seed, by use of a solvent selected from among water, lower alcohols of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, such as methanol, ethanol, butanol, etc., ethylene, acetone, hexane, ether, chloroform, ethylacetate, butylacetate, dichloromethane, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 1,3-butylene glycol, propylene glycol and a combination thereof, but also a fraction of the crude extract in such a solvent.

In addition, the extracts may be in a concentrated liquid phase or a solid phase as a result of removing the extraction solvent by freeze drying, vacuum drying, hot-air drying, or spray drying. Preferably, the extracts may be crude extracts produced from whole grape, honeybush or grape seed using a solvent selected from the group consisting of water, ethanol and a combination thereof, or a fraction of the crude extract. As used herein, the term “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” of a composition, extract mixture, component of the extract mixture, and/or active agent or ingredient refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time sufficient to achieve a desired result. For example, the “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” refers to that amount of a composition, extract mixture, component of the extract mixture, and/or active agent or ingredient of this invention which, when administered to a subject (e.g., mammal, such as a human), is sufficient to effect treatment, including any one or more of: (1) synergistically inhibiting DGAT-I in a subject; (2) treating, preventing or managing weight gain in a subject; (3) facilitating weight loss; (4) suppressing appetite in a subject; (5) treating or preventing obesity in a subject; (6) modifying fat uptake in a subject (e.g., by reducing fat absorption, transport, deposition, production and/or secretion); (7) reducing absorption, assimilation and deposition of dietary fat by inhibiting the synthesis of fat that occurs within intestinal cells; (8) interfering with increasing metabolism to promote weight loss or prevent weight gain in a subject; (9) maintaining body weight of the mammal; (10) treating, preventing, or managing skin condition or disorder associated with skin oil production in a subject. The amount of a composition, extract mixture, component of the extract mixture, and/or active agent or ingredient of this disclosure that constitutes a “therapeutically effective amount” will vary depending on the active agent or the compound, the condition being treated and its severity, the manner of administration, the duration of treatment, or the age of the subject to be treated, but can be determined routinely by one of ordinary skill in the art having regard to his own knowledge and to this disclosure. The “sub-effective amount” or “sub-therapeutic amount” of a composition, extract mixture, component of the extract mixture, and/or active agent or ingredient or a therapy is an amount less than the effective amount for that composition, extract mixture, component of the extract mixture, and/or active agent or ingredient or therapy, but when combined with an effective or sub-therapeutic amount of another composition, extract mixture, component of the extract mixture, and/or active agent or ingredient can produce a desired result, due to, for example, synergy in the resulting efficacious effects, and/or reduced side effects. The terms “synergistic effect” or “synergizing effect” is defined herein as the interaction of two or more combination compositions (e.g., an extract mixture) to produce a combined biological effect(s) greater than the sum of their separate effects (i.e., 1+1<2 or 1+1+1<3). The synergistic effect can be about or greater than about 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, 120, 150, 200, 250, 350, or 500% or even more than the summed (additive) effect of each composition. The effect can be any of the measurable effects described herein. As used herein, the term “carrier” refers to a composition that aids in maintaining one or more components (e.g., effective ingredients or active agents) of a composition in a soluble and homogeneous state in a form suitable for administration, which is nontoxic and which does not interact with other components in a deleterious manner. A carrier includes, but is not limited to, any materials known in the art including but not limited to any powder, liquid, gel, solubilizer, or binder. Some exemplary carriers include, but are not limited to, maltodextrin, gum arabic, starch, microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, the carrier is maltodextrin and/or the carrier that is used is taste and/or astringency neutral, i.e., it has no effect on palatability including astringency of the resulting product. As used herein, the term “skin” refers to cell layers comprising the integument of a human or non-human individual, and its structural components such as hair, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, apocrine (sweat) glands, fingernails and toenails. As used herein, the term “affected area of the skin” refers to a region of the skin that is to be treated with a composition including the active ingredients. For example, the affected area may be the site of a skin condition or disorder associated with skin oil production in an individual for which treatment or prevention is sought. In some cases, the affected area may encompass all skin on an individual. Alternatively, the affected area may be a site for which improvement of a cosmetic nature is sought, and can also include all skin on an individual or a specific area of the skin, such as face, back, or arms. The term “skin condition or disorder associated with skin oil production” refers to any condition or disorder of the skin that results from either, increased or decreased skin oil production by the sebaceous glands of the skin. Examples of skin conditions or disorders associated with skin oil production include but are not limited to acne, sebaceous cysts, hyperplasia, blackheads, rough or uneven skin, enlarged and visible pores, eczema and the like. As used herein, the term “systemic” or “systemically” refers to a mode of administration of a therapy via the blood stream or lymphatic system. Examples of a systemic treatment include, but are not limited to, oral gavage or ingestion, intravenous or subdermal pump infusion, and injection via intramuscular, intraperitoneal, hypodermic or subdermic injection. As used herein, the term “topical” or “topically” refers to a mode of administration that is applied directly to an area of the skin, which may be the affected area of the skin. Examples of a topical treatment include, but are not limited to application of cream, lotion, gel, shampoo, conditioning lotion, spray, a pad, a bandage, a diaper, a moistened towelette, or transdermal patch; and local administration via intracutaneous injection or introduction of a lozenge or suppository. The terms “treating” or “treatment” as used herein refer to the treatment of the disease or condition of interest in a mammal, such as a human, having the disease or condition of interest, and includes: (i) preventing the disease or condition from occurring in a mammal, in particular, when such mammal is predisposed to the condition but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (ii) inhibiting the disease or condition, i.e., arresting its development; (iii) relieving the disease or condition, i.e., causing regression of the disease or condition; or (iv) relieving the symptoms resulting from the disease or condition, (e.g., relieving pain, reducing inflammation, causing weight loss) without addressing the underlying disease or condition. As used herein, the terms “disease” and “condition” may be used interchangeably or may be different in that the particular malady or condition may not have a known causative agent (so that etiology has not yet been worked out) and it is therefore not yet recognized as a disease but only as an undesirable condition or syndrome, wherein a more or less specific set of symptoms have been identified by clinicians. The terms “administer,” “administered,” “administers” and “administering” are defined as providing a composition to a subject via a route known in the art, including but not limited to intravenous, intraarterial, oral, parenteral, buccal, topical, transdermal, rectal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraosseous, transmucosal, or intraperitoneal routes of administration. In certain embodiments, oral routes of administering a composition may be preferred. Alternatively, topical administration may be preferable. As used herein, the term “subject” or “individual” includes mammals to which a composition may be administered. Non-limiting examples of mammals include humans, non-human primates, rodents (including transgenic and non-transgenic mice) or the like. The methods described herein can be useful in human therapeutics, pre-clinical, nutraceutical, cosmetic and veterinary applications. In some embodiments, the subject is a mammal, and in some embodiments, the subject is human. As used herein, “agent,” “active agent,” “biologically active agent,” or “active substance” refers to a biological, pharmaceutical, or chemical compound or other moiety obtained from a plant extract. Specifically, agent,” “active agent,” “biologically active agent,” or “active substance” may be a biological, pharmaceutical, or chemical compound or other moiety may be obtained from at least one of whole grape extract, honeybush extract and grape seed extract. Non-limiting examples include simple or complex organic or inorganic molecules, a peptide, a protein, a carbohydrate, a fatty acid or lipid like molecule. The terms “modulator” refers to an active agent or a substance included as part of the composition, which modulates the activity or expression of one or more cellular proteins in a subject. A modulator may augment or suppress the activity and/or expression level or pattern of a molecule. A modulator can activate a component in a pathway by directly binding to the component. A modulator can also indirectly activate a component in a pathway by interacting with one or more associated components. The output of the pathway can be measured in terms of the expression or activity level of proteins. The expression level of a protein in a pathway can be reflected by levels of corresponding mRNA or related transcription factors as well as the level of the protein in a subcellular location. For instance, certain proteins are activated by translocating in or out of a specific subcellular component, including but not limited to nucleus, mitochondria, endosome, lysosome or other membranous structure of a cell. The output of the pathway can also be measured in terms of physiological effects, such as fat absorption and/or assimilation, weight loss, reduced skin oil production, etc. An “activator” refers to a modulator that influences a pathway in a manner that increases the pathway output. Activation of a particular target may be direct (e.g. by interaction with the target) or indirect (e.g. by interaction with a protein upstream of the target in a signaling pathway including the target). The terms “suppressor” or “inhibitor” refers to a modulator that influences a pathway in a manner that decreases pathway output. Inhibition of a particular target may be direct (e.g. by interaction with the target) or indirect (e.g. by interaction with a protein upstream of the target in a signaling pathway including the target). Compositions A useful composition comprises at least physiologically acceptable quantity of an extract mixture that includes: (i) a whole grape extract that is able to at least partially inhibit DGAT-I activity, and (ii) at least one of: (a) at least physiologically acceptable quantity of a honeybush extract that is able to at least partially activate the PGCIα promoter activity and synergistically inhibit DGAT-I activity, and/or (b) at least physiologically acceptable quantity of a grape seed extract that is able to at least partially inhibit SREBPIc promoter activity and synergistically inhibit DGAT-I activity thereby having important ramifications in health and disease and a broad and important use in for weight management applications, as well, skin oil management applications. Specifically, the described compositions can interfere with the absorption and assimilation of dietary fat by inhibiting the synthesis of fat that occurs within intestinal cells (not within the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract). The described compositions may also interfere with the synthesis of fat in adipose tissue within the body, a potential benefit observed that is not part of the effects of bile acid binding resins. In addition, the described compositions may interfere with the synthesis of fat in connection with the sebum production in the skin, and may have an effect of, for example, reducing excessive skin oil production in the instance of topical application. The inhibition of absorption, assimilation and deposition of dietary fat may facilitate weight loss in individuals seeking to lose or maintain weight, and in whom high dietary fat intake is a challenge. For topical applications, the inhibition of fat production in sebum may improve or help to manage skin conditions associated with skin oil production (e.g., excessive skin oil production), such as skin acne.

It should be noted that silica, when used as an ingredient in the emulsion according to the invention can provide protection from infrared radiation. Ultrafine titanium dioxide in either of two forms, namely water-dispersible titanium dioxide and oil-dispersible titanium dioxide may be used. Water-dispersible titanium dioxide is ultrafine titanium dioxide, the particles of which are uncoated or which are coated with a material to impart a hydrophilic surface property to the particles. Examples of such materials include aluminum oxide and aluminum silicate. Oil-dispersible titanium dioxide is ultrafine titanium dioxide, the particles of which exhibit a hydrophobic surface property, and which, for this purpose, can be coated with metal soaps such as aluminum stearate, aluminum laurate or zinc stearate, or with organosilicone compounds. The term “ultrafine titanium dioxide” refers to particles of titanium dioxide having an average particle size of less than 100 nm, preferably from 10 to 40 nm and most preferably from 15 to 25 nm. The total amount of titanium dioxide that can, optionally, be incorporated in the composition according to the invention is from 1 to 25%, preferably from 2 to 10% and ideally from 3 to 7% by weight of the composition. A product for topical application can comprise at least 0.01%, and up to 10%, by weight extract mixture. Selected concentration ranges include from about 0.01% to about 3%, from about 0.1% to about 1%, from about 0.1% to about 3%, from about 0.1% to about 5%, from about 0.3% to about 1%, from about 0.3% to about 3%, from about 0.3% to about 5%, from about 0.5% to about 1%, from about 0.5% to about 3%, and from about 0.5% to about 5%. Typically, 0.01% to 1% is an effective concentration range that can be applied at a variety of intervals. In some cases, it is preferred to apply the product in a concentration of up to 5% to treat some pathological conditions or diseases. There are also instances in which a concentration of up to 10% may be required, due to the severity of a condition or disease. Uses and Products Whole grape extracts were identified as potent inhibitors of an enzyme that catalyzes the terminal step in mammalian triglyceride (fat) synthesis, diacylglycerol acyltransferase-I or DGAT-I. Specifically, whole grape extracts were identified to be potent inhibitors of DGAT-I activity in both, the cell-free and cellular DGAT-I assays (see FIGS. 1 and 2). When the whole grape extract was tested in a proof-of-mechanism human clinical trial, it resulted in a characteristic response in vivo DGAT-I inhibition, including: (1) decreased fasting triglycerides, (2) reduced response to oral fat challenge, and (3) delayed time to maximum triglyceride concentration (see FIG. 3). In addition, two complementary mechanisms that could synergize with DGAT-I to inhibit lipid formation and subsequent adipose tissue formation were identified. The two targets were identified as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator I-alpha (PGCIα) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein Ic (SREBPIc). Botanical extracts of honeybush and grape seed were identified as an activator of the PGCIα promoter activity (FIG. 4) and an inhibitor of SREBPIc promoter activity, respectively (see FIGS. 4 and 5). In a series of synergy experiments to examine the potential synergistic effects of combining whole grape extract with either the honeybush extract or the grape seed extract, both extracts provided synergy to the whole grape extract on cellular DGAT-I activity (see FIGS. 6 and 7). In view of this synergistic effect on the DGAT-I enzyme activity and further inhibitory effect on SREBPIc and activation of PGCIα, the compositions may be used in weight management applications, and for topical products, control of skin oil applications. Certain embodiments include the use of the present composition to modulate the DGAT-I enzyme, for example, to inhibit the DGAT-I enzyme. Certain embodiments relate to the use of the present composition to modulate dietary fat absorption and assimilation in a subject. Other embodiments relate to the use of the present composition to suppress the synthesis of fat in adipose tissue.

Another embodiment relates to a method of synergistically inhibiting DGAT-I in a subject. The method includes administering to the subject a composition comprising an effective amount of an extract mixture that includes a whole grape extract and at least one of a honeybush extract and a grape seed extract to synergistically inhibit DGAT-I in the subject. EXAMPLES A better understanding may be obtained through the following examples which are set forth to illustrate, but are not to be construed as limiting. Methods The whole grape extract is prepared by extracting pulp, skin and seeds with water & ethanol to produce a yield of 8000:1 fresh whole grapes to whole grape extract ratio. Dried Honeybush leaves and stems, Numi Organic Tea bags, were extracted in 83% ethanol/water at a 1:10 material to alcohol ratio at 140° F. for 2 hours with constant mixing. The slurry was then cooled and passed through a 325 mesh screen and the resulting cake was hand pressed. All liquid extracts collected were combined and the remaining alcohol was removed by evaporation. Water was added to approximately double the amount of liquid concentrate. An extraction of the grape seed was performed by extracting grape seed with hot water at 30-50:1 grape seed to solvent ratio. Example 1 Identification of Potent Inhibitors of DGAT-1 More than 200 botanical extracts were evaluated in a cell-free DGAT-I enzyme assay for properties to inhibit the DGAT-I enzyme activity. The botanical extracts were also evaluated in a cellular DGAT-I assay model system. DGATI Enzyme Assay Protocol: Microsomes from Human intestinal cells were used as the source of DGATI enzyme. Dioleoyl Glycerol (DG) and Palmitoleoyl-Coenzyme A (PCoA) were the substrates for DGATI. Substrates (DG (300 uM)+PCoA (75 uM)) were mixed with botanical extracts, vehicle or positive control (A922500) in a 1.5 mL tube. Microsomes (22.5 ug/mL) were added, vortexed and incubated in a 37° C. water bath for 1 hour. After 1 hour, Dioeloyl-Palmitolyl glycerol (TG product formed from DGATI enzyme reaction) and Trioeloyl glycerol (internal standard) were extracted with Isopropyl Alcohol/Methylene Chloride/Formic Acid. Extracted TGs were filtered and then separated and identified by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometer (LCMS) using Acetonitrile/Isopropyl Alcohol/Methylene Chloride/Formic Acid/Ammonium Hydroxide Mobile Phase. Dioeloyl-Palmitolyl glycerols were quantitated relative to internal standard. Cellular DGATI Assay Protocol: 293H cells were plated at confluence in 12 well culture plates and allowed to adhere overnight. The next morning, media was replaced with serum free medium containing botanical extracts alone and in combination for synergy experiments or controls (Vehicle, A922500 (positive control)) and allowed to incubate for 30 minutes (pretreatment). After pretreatment, triglyceride (TG) synthesis was induced with 0.3 mM oleic acid/BSA containing [14C]-glycerol (1 uCi/ml) and allowed to incubate for 5 hours at 37° C., 5% CO2. Control cells pretreated with vehicle had serum-free medium+10% fatty acid free BSA and [14C]-glycerol added to control for oleic acid induction. After 5 hours, medium was removed and cells washed, dislodged and collected in a small volume of PBS. Samples were prepped for thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) by extraction with chloroform/methanol and the organic layer washed before an aliquot of the final organic phase is dried to completion. Lipids are solubilized with a small amount of chloroform containing TG, 1,2- and 1,3-DAG, and MAG standards and separated by TLC using toluene/chloroform/methanol mobile phase. Lipid species were identified by iodine vapor and comparison to standards. Radioactivity incorporated into TG was determined by scraping and counting by MicroBeta TriLux. Whole Grape Extracts were identified as potent inhibitors of DGAT-I activity in both the cell-free and cellular DGAT-I assays (see FIGS. 1 & 2). Specifically, FIG. 1 shows the dose response and EC50 value (3.053 μg/mL) of whole grape extract on DGAT-I enzyme inhibition in a cell-free assay. FIG. 2 shows the dose response and EC50 (46.574 mL) value of the whole grape extract on cellular DGAT-I inhibition. Example 2 Proof of Mechanism Human Clinical Trial Human Proof of Mechanism (POM) Clinical Trial Design: The clinical trial was a 2-arm parallel, double-blind study of 37 healthy overweight/obese (BMI of 25-35 kg/m2) men and women that were randomized to receive 2 grams daily of whole grape extract or placebo for a period of 7 days. Prior to and after the 7 day intervention with whole grape extract or placebo, study subjects consumed a meal challenge containing a standardized triglyceride load (84% Fat, 12% Carbohydrate, 4% protein). Blood samples were taken before and immediately following the meal challenge across a six hour interval and were evaluated for serum triglycerides levels, which is a validated measure of DGATI activity (Pharmacological inhibition to examine the role of DGATI in dietary lipid absorption in rodents and humans. Benjamin S. Maciejewski et al., American Journal of Physiology—Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology 2013 Vol. 304: G958-G969 DOI: 10.1152/ajpgi.00384.2012). When whole grape extract was tested in a Proof of Mechanism Human clinical trial, it resulted in a characteristic response of in vivo DGAT-I inhibition, including: (1) decreased fasting triglycerides, (2) reduced response to oral fat challenge and (3) delayed time to maximum triglyceride concentration (see FIGS. 3A-C). Specifically, as shown in FIG. 3A, seven days of placebo treatment did not affect serum triglyceride response to an oral fat challenge, which is a validated method to examine DGAT-I activity in vivo. As shown in FIG. 3B, treatment with 2 grams of whole grape extract showed a significant percent reduction in triglyceride response at the conclusion of the treatment period (7 days) as compared to the triglyceride response before the initiation of the study. As shown in FIG. 3C, similarly, a 7 day treatment with whole grape extract resulted in a significant delta reduction in triglyceride response as compared to the placebo.

The two targets were peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator I-alpha (PGCIα) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein Ic (SREBPIc). A. PGCIα Promoter Activity CHO cell line was stably transfected with a luciferase reporter vector (pGL4.27) under the control of the full length human PGCIα promoter. Stable cells were grown and treated with extracts in a 96 well plate for 18 hr. After 18 hrs of incubation, the medium from the cell were removed and the cells washed once with 200 ul of PBS (Phosphate buffered saline). Then 20 μl of passive lysis buffer was added per well and incubated at room temperature to lyse the cells. Subsequent to this, 100 μl of luciferase substrate buffer was added and the luminescence was read in a plate reader. A botanical extract (Honeybush) that activated the PGCIα promoter activity was identified (FIG. 4). Specifically, FIG. 4 shows a dose response activation of the cellular PGCIα promoter activity by honeybush extract. B. SREBPIc Promoter Activity HEPG2 cell line was stably transfected with a luciferase reporter vector (pGL4.27) under the control of the full length human SREBPIc promoter. Stable cells were grown and treated with extracts in a 96 well plate for 18 hr. After 18 hrs of incubation, the medium from the cell were removed and the cells washed once with 200 ul of PBS (Phosphate buffered saline). Then 20 μl of passive lysis buffer was added per well and incubated at room temperature to lyse the cells. Subsequent to this, 100 μl of luciferase substrate buffer was added and the luminescence was read in a plate reader. A botanical extract (Grape Seed) that inhibited SREBPIc promoter activity was identified (FIG. 5). Specifically, FIG. 5 shows a dose response inhibition of the SREBPIc promoter activity by grape seed extract. Example 4 Synergy with the Grape Seed Extract Potential synergistic effects of combining the whole grape extract with the grape seed extract were examined. 20 μg/mL dose of grape extract, various doses of the grape seed extract (20 μg/mL, 30 μg/mL and 40 μg/mL) and a low dose the Whole grape extract (20 μg/mL) in combination with various doses of grape seed were tested to determine the effect on the cellular triglyceride formation (FIGS. 6A-C; data is expressed as percent of untreated control cells). As shown in FIGS. 6A-C, significant synergistic responses were apparent at all doses of grape seed extract tested in combination with 20 μg/mL dose of the whole grape extract. As shown in FIG. 6A, the 20 μg/mL dose of the Whole grape extract in combination with the lowest dose of the grape seed extract (20 μg/mL) resulted in a significant reduction in cellular triglyceride formation as compared to the control, the Whole grape extract alone, and the grape seed extract alone. When the result was compared to the “predicted” additive effect (i.e., effect of the Whole grape extract alone in combination with effect of the grape seed extract alone), a maximal synergy was seen at that dose, 55% reduction (FIG. 6A). As shown in FIG. 6B, the whole grape extract in combination with the grape seed extract at 30 μg/mL resulted in 48% reduction in cellular triglyceride formation as compared to the predicted result for the combination. As shown in FIG. 6C, the whole grape extract in combination with the grape seed extract at 40 μg/mL resulted in 34% reduction in cellular triglyceride formation as compared to the predicted result for the combination. Example 5 Synergy with the Honeybush Extract Potential synergistic effects of combining the whole grape extract with the honeybush extract were examined. 20 μg/mL dose of the Whole grape extract, various doses of honeybush extract (10 μg/mL, 25 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL) and a low dose Whole grape extract (20 μg/mL) in combination with various doses of the honeybush extract were tested to determine the effect on the cellular triglyceride formation (FIGS. 7A-C; data is expressed as percent of untreated control cells). As shown in FIGS. 7A-C, a significant synergistic response was apparent a high dose of the honeybush extract tested in combination with the whole grape extract at the 20 μg/mL dose. As shown in FIG. 7A, the Whole grape extract in combination with the honeybush extract at 10 μg/mL resulted in no observable effect on cellular triglyceride formation as compared to the control, the whole grape extract alone, the honeybush extract alone, and the predicted result. As shown in FIG. 7B, the whole grape extract in combination with the honeybush extract at 25 μg/mL resulted in about 5% reduction in cellular triglycerides as compared to the predicted result. As shown in FIG. 7C, the 20 μg/mL dose of the whole grape extract in combination with the highest dose of the honeybush extract (50 μg/mL) resulted in a significant reduction in cellular triglyceride formation as compared to the control, the Whole grape extract alone, and the honeybush extract alone. When the result was compared to the “predicted” additive effect (i.e., effect of Whole grape extract alone in combination with the effect of the honeybush extract alone at 50 μg/mL), a maximal synergy was seen at that dose, about 36% reduction (FIG. 7C). The described experiments confirm the synergistic effect of an extract mixture that includes the whole grape extract with either honeybush extract or the grape seed extract on cellular formation of the triglycerides via inhibition of the DGAT-I enzyme.
