Step 5: Preparation of 2-(3-(4-2-(benzyloxy)-3-nitrophenyl-1H-pyrazole-1-yl) -1-(methylsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl)acetonitrile
To 2-(3-(4-2-(benzyloxy)-3-nitrophenyl-1H- pyrazole-1-yl) azetidin-3-yl)acetonitrile (900 mg, 2.3 mmol) and triethylamine (730 mg, 7.2 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) was added dropwise methanesulfonyl chloride (529 mg, 4.6 mmol) at 0°C under the protection of nitrogen. The mixture was stirred at 0°C for reacting for 1 hour. LC-MS detected and showed that the reaction was completed. The reaction mixture was quenched with water (50 mL) and then extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL×3). The organic phase was combined, washed with saturated salt water(5 mL), dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered and spun dry. The residue was separated and purified through column chromatography (PE:EA=1:1(0.5% Et3N)) to give 2-(3-(4-2-(benzyloxy)-3-nitrophenyl-1H-pyrazole-1-yl)-1-(methylsulfonyl)azetidin-3-yl)a cetonitrile(450 mg, 37.5% yield) as a yellow oil.
