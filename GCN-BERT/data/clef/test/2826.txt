rac-(2R,3S,4R,5R)-ethyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-2-carboxylate
To a solution of (E)-ethyl 2-((2-methoxybenzylidene)amino)acetate (26.72 g, 120.94 mmol) and lithium bromide (13.90 g, 131.02 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (220 mL) at −78° C. was added (E)-3, 3-dimethyl-1-nitrobut-1-ene (13.0 g, 110.78 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) and DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, 22.6 mL, 151.18 mmol) dropwise. The mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 2.5 hours and quenched with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (100 mL), extracted with ethyl acetate (2×150 mL), washed with brine (2×150 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The residue was triturated with petroleum ether (100 mL). The solid was collected by filtration and dried in vacuo to provide the title compound rac-(2R,3S,4R,5R)-ethyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (10.3 g, 29.43 mmol, 28.3% yield).
