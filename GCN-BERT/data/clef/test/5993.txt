No. 61/699,422, filed Sep. 11, 2012; each of which is fully incorporated by reference herein. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides novel ketone linked benzothiazole compounds and analogues, which are endothelial lipase (EL) inhibitors, compositions containing them, and methods of using them, for example, for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of dyslipidemias and the sequelae thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cardiovascular disease is a major health risk throughout the industrialized world. Atherosclerosis, the most prevalent of cardiovascular diseases, is the principal cause of heart attack, and stroke, and thereby the principal cause of death in the United States. Atherosclerosis is a complex disease involving many cell types and molecular factors (for a detailed review, see Ross, R., Nature, 362(6423):801-809 (1993)). Results from epidemiologic studies have clearly established an inverse relationship between levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL), which transports endogenous cholesterol from tissues to the liver as well as mediating selective cholesteryl ester delivery to steroidogenic tissues, and the risk for atherosclerosis (Gordon, D. J. et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 321(19):1311-1316 (1989)). The metabolism of HDL is influenced by several members of the triacylglycerol (TG) lipase family of proteins, which hydrolyze triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesteryl esters, generating fatty acids to facilitate intestinal absorption, energy production, or storage. Of the TG lipases, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) influences the metabolism of HDL cholesterol by hydrolyzing triglycerides in triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, resulting in the transfer of lipids and apolipoproteins to HDL and is responsible for hydrolyzing chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) in muscle and adipose tissues. Hepatic lipase (HL) hydrolyzes HDL triglyceride and phospholipids, generating smaller, lipid-depleted HDL particles, and plays a role in the uptake of HDL cholesterol (Jin, W. et al., Trends Endocrinol. Metab., 13(4):174-178 (2002); Wong, H. et al., J. Lipid Res., 43:993-999 (2002)). Endothelial lipase (also known as EDL, EL, LIPG, endothelial-derived lipase, and endothelial cell-derived lipase) is synthesized in endothelial cells, a characteristic that distinguishes it from the other members of the family. Recombinant endothelial lipase protein has substantial phospholipase activity but has been reported to have less hydrolytic activity toward triglyceride lipids (Hirata, K. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 274(20):14170-14175 (1999); Jaye, M. et al., Nat. Genet., 21:424-428 (1999)). However, endothelial lipase does exhibit triglyceride lipase activity ex vivo in addition to its HDL phospholipase activity, and endothelial lipase was found to hydrolyze HDL more efficiently than other lipoproteins (McCoy, M. G. et al., J. Lipid Res., 43:921-929 (2002)). Overexpression of the human endothelial lipase gene in the livers of mice markedly reduces plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol and its major protein apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) (Jaye, M. et al., Nat. Genet., 21:424-428 (1999)). Various types of compounds have been reported to modulate the expression of endothelial lipase, for example, 3-oxo-1,3-dihydro-indazole-2-carboxamides (WO 2004/093872, US 2006/0211755 A1), 3-oxo-3-H-benzo[d]isoxazole-2-carboxamides (WO 2004/094393, U.S. Pat. No. 7,217,727), and benzisothiazol-3-one-2-carboxamides (WO 2004/094394, U.S. Pat. No. 7,595,403) by Eli Lilly & Co.; diacylindazole derivatives (WO 2007/042178, US 2008/0287448 A1) and imidazopyridin-2-one derivatives (WO 2007/110215, US 2009/0076068 A1), and azolopyridin-3-one derivatives (WO 2007/110216, US 2009/0054478 A1) by Sanofi-Aventis; heterocyclic derivatives (WO 2009/123164), keto-amide derivatives (WO 2009/133834), acetic acid amide derivatives (WO 2010/044441, US 2011/0251386 A1) and oxadiazole derivatives (WO 2011/074560) by Shionogi & Co., Ltd. However, because endothelial lipase is a relatively new member in the lipase gene family, a full understanding of the potential of endothelial lipase inhibitors to human health, as well as the inhibitors of other lipases in general, requires more studies. Thus, there is a clear need for new types of compounds capable of inhibiting the activity of lipases, particularly endothelial lipase, that would constitute effective treatments to the diseases or disorders associated with the activity of such lipases.

When enantiomeric or diastereomeric products are prepared, they may be separated by conventional methods, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Depending on the process conditions the end products of the present invention are obtained either in free (neutral) or salt form. Both the free form and the salts of these end products are within the scope of the invention. If so desired, one form of a compound may be converted into another form. A free base or acid may be converted into a salt; a salt may be converted into the free compound or another salt; a mixture of isomeric compounds of the present invention may be separated into the individual isomers. Compounds of the present invention, free form and salts thereof, may exist in multiple tautomeric forms, in which hydrogen atoms are transposed to other parts of the molecules and the chemical bonds between the atoms of the molecules are consequently rearranged.

The nitrogen atom may be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR wherein R is H or another substituent, if defined). The heterocyclic ring may be attached to its pendant group at any heteroatom or carbon atom that results in a stable structure. The heterocyclic rings described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen atom if the resulting compound is stable. A nitrogen in the heterocycle may optionally be quaternized. It is preferred that when the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. It is preferred that the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is not more than 1. When the term “heterocycle” is used, it is intended to include heteroaryl. Examples of heterocycles include, but are not limited to, acridinyl, azetidinyl, azocinyl, benzimidazolyl, benzofuranyl, benzothiofuranyl, benzothiophenyl, benzoxazolyl, benzoxazolinyl, benzthiazolyl, benztriazolyl, benztetrazolyl, benzisoxazolyl, benzisothiazolyl, benzimidazolinyl, carbazolyl, 4aH-carbazolyl, carbolinyl, chromanyl, chromenyl, cinnolinyl, decahydroquinolinyl, 2H,6H-1,5,2-dithiazinyl, dihydrofuro[2,3-b]tetrahydrofuran, furanyl, furazanyl, imidazolidinyl, imidazolinyl, imidazolyl, 1H-indazolyl, imidazolopyridinyl, indolenyl, indolinyl, indolizinyl, indolyl, 3H-indolyl, isatinoyl, isobenzofuranyl, isochromanyl, isoindazolyl, isoindolinyl, isoindolyl, isoquinolinyl, isothiazolyl, isothiazolopyridinyl, isoxazolyl, isoxazolopyridinyl, methylenedioxyphenyl, morpholinyl, naphthyridinyl, octahydroisoquinolinyl, oxadiazolyl, 1,2,3-oxadiazolyl, 1,2,4-oxadiazolyl, 1,2,5-oxadiazolyl, 1,3,4-oxadiazolyl, oxazolidinyl, oxazolyl, oxazolopyridinyl, oxazolidinylperimidinyl, oxindolyl, pyrimidinyl, phenanthridinyl, phenanthrolinyl, phenazinyl, phenothiazinyl, phenoxathiinyl, phenoxazinyl, phthalazinyl, piperazinyl, piperidinyl, piperidonyl, 4-piperidonyl, piperonyl, pteridinyl, purinyl, pyranyl, pyrazinyl, pyrazolidinyl, pyrazolinyl, pyrazolopyridinyl, pyrazolyl, pyridazinyl, pyridooxazolyl, pyridoimidazolyl, pyridothiazolyl, pyridinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, pyrrolinyl, 2-pyrrolidonyl, 2H-pyrrolyl, pyrrolyl, quinazolinyl, quinolinyl, 4H-quinolizinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinuclidinyl, tetrazolyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, tetrahydroquinolinyl, 6H-1,2,5-thiadiazinyl, 1,2,3-thiadiazolyl, 1,2,4-thiadiazolyl, 1,2,5-thiadiazolyl, 1,3,4-thiadiazolyl, thianthrenyl, thiazolyl, thienyl, thiazolopyridinyl, thienothiazolyl, thienooxazolyl, thienoimidazolyl, thiophenyl, triazinyl, 1,2,3-triazolyl, 1,2,4-triazolyl, 1,2,5-triazolyl, 1,3,4-triazolyl, and xanthenyl.

Also included are fused ring and spiro compounds containing, for example, the above heterocycles. As used herein, the term “bicyclic heterocycle” or “bicyclic heterocyclic group” is intended to mean a stable 9- or 10-membered heterocyclic ring system which contains two fused rings and consists of carbon atoms and 1, 2, 3, or 4 heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S. Of the two fused rings, one ring is a 5- or 6-membered monocyclic aromatic ring comprising a 5-membered heteroaryl ring, a 6-membered heteroaryl ring or a benzo ring, each fused to a second ring. The second ring is a 5- or 6-membered monocyclic ring which is saturated, partially unsaturated, or unsaturated, and comprises a 5-membered heterocycle, a 6-membered heterocycle or a carbocycle (provided the first ring is not benzo when the second ring is a carbocycle). The bicyclic heterocyclic group may be attached to its pendant group at any heteroatom or carbon atom which results in a stable structure. The bicyclic heterocyclic group described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen atom if the resulting compound is stable. It is preferred that when the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. It is preferred that the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is not more than 1. Examples of a bicyclic heterocyclic group are, but not limited to, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, phthalazinyl, quinazolinyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, indolinyl, 1H-indazolyl, benzimidazolyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolinyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-quinolinyl, 2,3-dihydro-benzofuranyl, chromanyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoxalinyl, and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinazolinyl. As used herein, the term “aromatic heterocyclic group” or “heteroaryl” is intended to mean stable monocyclic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that include at least one heteroatom ring member such as sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen. Heteroaryl groups include, without limitation, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, triazinyl, furyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, thienyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, indolyl, pyrroyl, oxazolyl, benzofuryl, benzothienyl, benzthiazolyl, isoxazolyl, pyrazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, indazolyl, 1,2,4-thiadiazolyl, isothiazolyl, purinyl, carbazolyl, benzimidazolyl, indolinyl, benzodioxolanyl, and benzodioxane. Heteroaryl groups are substituted or unsubstituted. The nitrogen atom is substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR wherein R is H or another substituent, if defined). The nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (i.e., N→O and S(O)p, wherein p is 0, 1 or 2). Bridged rings are also included in the definition of heterocycle. A bridged ring occurs when one or more, preferably one to three, atoms (i.e., C, O, N, or S) link two non-adjacent carbon or nitrogen atoms. Examples of bridged rings include, but are not limited to, one carbon atom, two carbon atoms, one nitrogen atom, two nitrogen atoms, and a carbon-nitrogen group. It is noted that a bridge always converts a monocyclic ring into a tricyclic ring. When a ring is bridged, the substituents recited for the ring may also be present on the bridge. The term “counter ion” is used to represent a negatively charged species such as chloride, bromide, hydroxide, acetate, and sulfate. When a dotted ring is used within a ring structure, this indicates that the ring structure may be saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated. As referred to herein, the term “substituted” means that at least one hydrogen atom is replaced with a non-hydrogen group, provided that normal valencies are maintained and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When a substituent is keto (i.e., ═O), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Keto substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. When a ring system (e.g., carbocyclic or heterocyclic) is said to be substituted with a carbonyl group or a double bond, it is intended that the carbonyl group or double bond be part (i.e., within) of the ring. Ring double bonds, as used herein, are double bonds that are formed between two adjacent ring atoms (e.g., C═C, C═N, or N═N). In cases wherein there are nitrogen atoms (e.g., amines) on compounds of the present invention, these may be converted to N-oxides by treatment with an oxidizing agent (e.g., mCPBA and/or hydrogen peroxides) to afford other compounds of this invention. Thus, shown and claimed nitrogen atoms are considered to cover both the shown nitrogen and its N-oxide (N→O) derivative. When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-3 R groups, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to three R groups, and at each occurrence R is selected independently from the definition of R. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom in which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. As a person of ordinary skill in the art would be able to understand, the ketone (—C—C═O) group in a molecule may exist in different tautomeric forms and or different hydrate forms, wherein R1, R2 and R4 are as defined above: Thus, this disclosure is intended to cover all possible tautomers even when a structure depicts only one of them. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms that are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and/or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic groups such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1990), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In addition, compounds of Formula (I), Formula (II), or Formula (III) may have prodrug forms. Any compound that will be converted in vivo to provide the bioactive agent (i.e., a compound of Formula (I), Formula (II) or Formula (III)) is a prodrug within the scope and spirit of the invention. Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art. For examples of such prodrug derivatives, see: a) Bundgaard, H., ed., Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier (1985), and Widder, K. et al., eds., Methods in Enzymology, 112:309-396, Academic Press (1985); b) Bundgaard, H., Chapter 5, “Design and Application of Prodrugs”, Krosgaard-Larsen, P. et al., eds., A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, pp. 113-191, Harwood Academic Publishers (1991); c) Bundgaard, H., Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev., 8:1-38 (1992);d) Bundgaard, H. et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 77:285 (1988); ande) Kakeya, N. et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 32:692 (1984). Compounds containing a carboxy group can form physiologically hydrolyzable esters that serve as prodrugs by being hydrolyzed in the body to yield compounds of the present invention per se. Such prodrugs are preferably administered orally since hydrolysis in many instances occurs principally under the influence of the digestive enzymes. Parenteral administration may be used where the ester per se is active, or in those instances where hydrolysis occurs in the blood. Examples of physiologically hydrolyzable esters of compounds of the present invention include C1 to C6 alkyl, C1 to C6 alkylbenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, indanyl, phthalyl, methoxymethyl, C1-6 alkanoyloxy-C1-6 alkyl (e.g., acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl or propionyloxymethyl), C1 to C6 alkoxycarbonyloxy-C1 to C6 alkyl (e.g., methoxycarbonyl-oxymethyl or ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, glycyloxymethyl, phenylglycyloxymethyl, (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)-methyl), and other well known physiologically hydrolyzable esters used, for example, in the penicillin and cephalosporin arts. Such esters may be prepared by conventional techniques known in the art. Preparation of prodrugs is well known in the art and described in, for example, King, F. D., ed., Medicinal Chemistry: Principles and Practice, The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK (1994); Testa, B. et al., Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism. Chemistry, Biochemistry and Enzymology, VCHA and Wiley-VCH, Zurich, Switzerland (2003); Wermuth, C. G., ed., The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1999). The present invention is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include deuterium and tritium. Isotopes of carbon include 13C and 14C. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed. Such compounds have a variety of potential uses, e.g., as standards and reagents in determining the ability of a potential pharmaceutical compound to bind to target proteins or receptors, or for imaging compounds of this invention bound to biological receptors in vivo or in vitro. “Stable compound” and “stable structure” are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. It is preferred that compounds of the present invention do not contain a N-halo, S(O)2H, or S(O)H group. The term “solvate” means a physical association of a compound of this invention with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more, preferably one to three, solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. The solvent molecules in the solvate may be present in a regular arrangement and/or a non-ordered arrangement. The solvate may comprise either a stoichiometric or nonstoichiometric amount of the solvent molecules. “Solvate” encompasses both solution-phase and isolable solvates. Exemplary solvates include, but are not limited to, hydrates, ethanolates, methanolates, and isopropanolates. Methods of solvation are generally known in the art.

The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized using the methods described below, together with synthetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or by variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those described below. The reactions are performed in a solvent or solvent mixture appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and suitable for the transformations being affected. It will be understood by those skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on the molecule should be consistent with the transformations proposed. This will sometimes require a judgment to modify the order of the synthetic steps or to select one particular process scheme over another in order to obtain a desired compound of the invention. A particularly useful compendium of synthetic methods which may be applicable to the preparation of compounds of the present invention may be found in Larock, R. C., Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH, New York (1989). Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those described below. All references cited herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety herein by reference. The novel compounds of this invention may be prepared using the reactions and techniques described in this section. Also, in the description of the synthetic methods described below, it is to be understood that all proposed reaction conditions, including choice of solvent, reaction atmosphere, reaction temperature, duration of the experiment and workup procedures, are chosen to be the conditions standard for that reaction, which should be readily recognized by one skilled in the art. Restrictions to the substituents that are compatible with the reaction conditions will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art and alternate methods must then be used. It will also be recognized that another major consideration in the planning of any synthetic route in this field is the judicious choice of the protecting group used for protection of the reactive functional groups present in the compounds described in this invention. An authoritative account describing the many alternatives to the trained practitioner is Greene et al. (Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley and Sons (1991)).

NMR Employed in Characterization of Examples 1H NMR spectra were obtained with Bruker or JEOL Fourier transform spectrometers operating at frequencies as follows: 1H NMR: 400 MHz (Bruker or JEOL) or 500 MHz (JEOL). 13C NMR: 100 MHz (Bruker or JEOL). Spectra data are reported in the format: chemical shift (multiplicity, coupling constants, number of hydrogens). Chemical shifts are specified in ppm downfield of a tetramethylsilane internal standard (8 units, tetramethylsilane=0 ppm) and/or referenced to solvent peaks, which in 1H NMR spectra appear at 2.49 ppm for CD2HSOCD3, 3.30 ppm for CD2HOD, and 7.24 ppm for CHCl3, and which in 13C NMR spectra appear at 39.7 ppm for CD3SOCD3, 49.0 ppm for CD3OD, and 77.0 ppm for CDCl3. All 13C NMR spectra were proton decoupled. Biology The endothelium occupies a pivotal position at the interface between the circulating humoral and cellular elements of the blood, and the solid tissues which constitute the various organs. In this unique position, endothelial cells regulate a large number of critical processes, including leukocyte adherence and transit through the blood vessel wall, local control of blood vessel tone, modulation of the immune response, the balance between thrombosis and thrombolysis, and new blood vessel development. Thus, endothelial cell dysfunction has been postulated as a central feature of vascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. (WO 1999/032611 and references cited therein, e.g., Folkman, J. et al., Science, 235:442-447 (1987); Yanagisawa, M. et al., Nature, 332(6163):411-415 (1988); Folkman, J. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 267(16):10931-10934 (1992); Janssens, S. P. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 267(21):14519-14522 (1992); Lamas, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 89(14):6348-6352 (1992); Luscher, T. F. et al., Hypertension, 19(2):117-130 (1992); Williams et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis., 146:S45-S50 (1992); and Bevilacqua, M. P. et al., J. Clin. Invest., 91(2):379-387 (1993)). Atherosclerosis and its associated coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality in the industrialized world. Despite attempts to modify secondary risk factors (smoking, obesity, lack of exercise) and treatment of dyslipidemia with dietary modification and drug therapy, coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the most common cause of death in the U.S., where cardiovascular disease accounts for 44% of all deaths, with 53% of these associated with atherosclerotic coronary heart disease. Risk for development of atherosclerosis has been shown to be strongly correlated with certain plasma lipid levels. While elevated low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) may be the most recognized form of dyslipidemia, it is by no means the only significant lipid associated contributor to CHD. Low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) is also a known risk factor for CHD (Gordon, D. J. et al., Circulation, 79(1):8-15 (1989)). High LDL-C and triglyceride levels are positively correlated, while high levels of HDL-C are negatively correlated with the risk for developing cardiovascular diseases. Thus, dyslipidemia is not a unitary risk profile for CHD but may be comprised of one or more, preferably one to three, lipid aberrations. At least 50% of the variation in HDL cholesterol levels is genetically determined. The phenotype of elevated HDL cholesterol is often dominantly inherited, but homozygous deficiency of HL or of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which result in elevated HDL cholesterol, are recessive conditions. Recently, several genetic variations in the human endothelial lipase gene have been identified, six of which potentially produce functional variants of the protein, and the frequencies of these variants were found to be associated with elevated levels of HDL cholesterol in human subjects (deLemos, A. S. et al., Circulation, 106(11):1321-1326 (2002)). Notably, the endothelial lipase-mediated binding and uptake of HDL particles and the selective uptake of HDL-derived cholesterol esters have been reported to be independent of its enzymatic lipolytic activity (Strauss, J. G. et al., Biochem. J., 368:69-79 (2002)). Because of the beneficial effects widely associated with elevated HDL levels, an agent which inhibits EL activity in humans, by virtue of its HDL increasing ability, are expected to be useful for the treatment, prevention, the arrestment and/or regression of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disorders etc., especially those (but not restricted thereto) which are characterized by one or more of the following factors: (a) high plasma triglyceride concentrations, high postprandial plasma triglyceride concentrations; (b) low HDL cholesterol concentration; (c) low apoA lipoprotein concentrations; (d) high LDL cholesterol concentrations; (e) small dense LDL cholesterol particles; and (f) high apoB lipoprotein concentrations. The term “modulator” refers to a chemical compound with capacity to either enhance (e.g., “agonist” activity) or partially enhance (e.g., “partial agonist” activity) or inhibit (e.g., “antagonist” activity or “inverse agonist” activity) a functional property of biological activity or process (e.g., enzyme activity or receptor binding); such enhancement or inhibition may be contingent on the occurrence of a specific event, such as activation of a signal transduction pathway, receptor internalization, and/or may be manifest only in particular cell types. It is also desirable and preferable to find compounds with advantageous and improved characteristics compared with known anti-atherosclerosis agents, in one or more of the following categories that are given as examples, and are not intended to be limiting: (a) pharmacokinetic properties, including oral bioavailability, half life, and clearance; (b) pharmaceutical properties; (c) dosage requirements; (d) factors that decrease blood drug concentration peak-to-trough characteristics; (e) factors that increase the concentration of active drug at the receptor; (f) factors that decrease the liability for clinical drug-drug interactions; (g) factors that decrease the potential for adverse side-effects, including selectivity versus other biological targets; and (h) improved therapeutic index. As used herein, the term “patient” encompasses all mammalian species. As used herein, the term “subject” refers to any human or non-human organism that could potentially benefit from treatment with an anti-atherosclerosis agent, e.g., an endothelial lipase inhibitor. Exemplary subjects include human beings of any age with risk factors for atherosclerosis and its associated coronary artery disease. Common risk factors include, but are not limited to, age, sex, weight, and family history. As used herein, “treating” or “treatment” cover the treatment of a disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, and include: (a) inhibiting the disease-state, i.e., arresting it development; and/or (b) relieving the disease-state, i.e., causing regression of the disease state. As used herein, “prophylaxis” or “prevention” covers the preventive treatment of a subclinical disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, aimed at reducing the probability of the occurrence of a clinical disease-state. Patients are selected for preventative therapy based on factors that are known to increase risk of suffering a clinical disease state compared to the general population. “Prophylaxis” therapies can be divided into (a) primary prevention and (b) secondary prevention. Primary prevention is defined as treatment in a subject that has not yet presented with a clinical disease state, whereas secondary prevention is defined as preventing a second occurrence of the same or similar clinical disease state. As used herein, “risk reduction” covers therapies that lower the incidence of development of a clinical disease state. As such, primary and secondary prevention therapies are examples of risk reduction. “Therapeutically effective amount” is intended to include an amount of a compound of the present invention that is effective when administered alone or in combination to inhibit endothelial lipase and/or to prevent or treat the disorders listed herein. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the preventive or therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially, or simultaneously. Biological Activity Endothelial lipase activity was measured using a fluorescent substrate, A10070, (Invitrogen, CA) doped into an artificial vesicle containing DMPG (Avanti Polar Lipids) as the excipient. Vesicles were prepared by combining 285 μL of 1 mM DMPG in a 1:1 mixture of MeOH and CHCl3 with 15 μL of 1 mM A10070 in a 1:1 mixture of MeOH and CHCl3. The mixture was dried under nitrogen and resuspended in 150 μL of 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0 buffer containing 100 mM NaCl and 0.2 mM EDTA. The sample was allowed to sit at rt for 15 min and then was sonicated 3×4 mins on ice with a Branson Sonicator using duty cycle 1. This preparation provides vesicles with a mole fraction of 0.05 for the FRET substrate. The enzymatic assay was measured using white, opaque 96-well half area plates. Each well contained 60 μL of assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM CaCl2) and 2 ul of a DMSO solution containing compound of interest. Conditioned media obtained from HT-1080 cells, which were transformed by RAGE technology (Athersys) to overexpress endogenous EL, was added and the reaction was allowed to incubate for 20 min at 37° C. with gentle agitation. The reaction was started by the addition of 20 μL of a 1:4 dilution of vesicles. The final total reaction volume was 100 μL. The reaction rates were measured on a Gemini plate reader with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission of 530 nm. Readings were taken every 20 seconds for 10 min with agitation between each reading. The slope of the linear portion of the readout was used to calculate the rate of the reaction.

Pharmaceutical Compositions, Formulations and Combinations The compounds of this invention can be administered for any of the uses described herein by any suitable means, for example, orally, such as tablets, capsules (each of which includes sustained release or timed release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups, and emulsions; sublingually; bucally; parenterally, such as by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques (e.g., as sterile injectable aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions); nasally, including administration to the nasal membranes, such as by inhalation spray; topically, such as in the form of a cream or ointment; or rectally such as in the form of suppositories. They can be administered alone, but generally will be administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The term “pharmaceutical composition” means a composition comprising a compound of the invention in combination with at least one additional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to media generally accepted in the art for the delivery of biologically active agents to animals, in particular, mammals, including, i.e., adjuvant, excipient or vehicle, such as diluents, preserving agents, fillers, flow regulating agents, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, anti-bacterial agents, anti-fungal agents, lubricating agents and dispensing agents, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are formulated according to a number of factors well within the purview of those of ordinary skill in the art. These include, without limitation: the type and nature of the active agent being formulated; the subject to which the agent-containing composition is to be administered; the intended route of administration of the composition; and the therapeutic indication being targeted. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include both aqueous and non-aqueous liquid media, as well as a variety of solid and semi-solid dosage forms. Such carriers can include a number of different ingredients and additives in addition to the active agent, such additional ingredients being included in the formulation for a variety of reasons, e.g., stabilization of the active agent, binders, etc., well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Descriptions of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and factors involved in their selection, are found in a variety of readily available sources such as, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition (1990). The dosage regimen for the compounds of the present invention will, of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the species, age, sex, health, medical condition, and weight of the recipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; the route of administration, the renal and hepatic function of the patient, and the effect desired. By way of general guidance, the daily oral dosage of each active ingredient, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.01 to about 5000 mg per day, preferably between about 0.1 to about 1000 mg per day, and most preferably between about 0.1 to about 250 mg per day. Intravenously, the most preferred doses will range from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. Compounds of this invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily. The compounds are typically administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients, or carriers (collectively referred to herein as pharmaceutical carriers) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, e.g., oral tablets, capsules, elixirs, and syrups, and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices. Dosage forms (pharmaceutical compositions) suitable for administration may contain from about 1 milligram to about 2000 milligrams of active ingredient per dosage unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.1-95% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. A typical capsule for oral administration contains at least one of the compounds of the present invention (250 mg), lactose (75 mg), and magnesium stearate (15 mg). The mixture is passed through a 60 mesh sieve and packed into a No. 1 gelatin capsule. A typical injectable preparation is produced by aseptically placing at least one of the compounds of the present invention (250 mg) into a vial, aseptically freeze-drying and sealing. For use, the contents of the vial are mixed with 2 mL of physiological saline, to produce an injectable preparation. The present invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as an active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the compounds of the present invention, alone or in combination with a pharmaceutical carrier. Optionally, compounds of the present invention can be used alone, in combination with other compounds of the invention, or in combination with one or more, preferably one to three, other therapeutic agent(s), e.g., HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or other pharmaceutically active material. The compounds of the present invention may be employed in combination with other EL inhibitors or one or more, preferably one to three, other suitable therapeutic agents useful in the treatment of the aforementioned disorders including: anti-atherosclerotic agents, anti-dyslipidemic agents, anti-diabetic agents, anti-hyperglycemic agents, anti-hyperinsulinemic agents, anti-thrombotic agents, anti-retinopathic agents, anti-neuropathic agents, anti-nephropathic agents, anti-ischemic agents, anti-hypertensive agents, anti-obesity agents, anti-hyperlipidemic agents, anti-hypertriglyceridemic agents, anti-hypercholesterolemic agents, anti-restenotic agents, anti-pancreatic agents, lipid lowering agents, anorectic agents, memory enhancing agents, anti-dementia agents, cognition promoting agents, appetite suppressants, treatments for heart failure, treatments for peripheral arterial disease, treatment for malignant tumors, and anti-inflammatory agents. The compounds of the present invention may be employed in combination with additional therapeutic agent(s) selected from one or more, preferably one to three, of the following therapeutic agents in treating atherosclerosis: anti-hyperlipidemic agents, plasma HDL-raising agents, anti-hypercholesterolemic agents, cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors (such as HMG CoA reductase inhibitors), acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitors, LXR agonist, probucol, raloxifene, nicotinic acid, niacinamide, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, bile acid sequestrants (such as anion exchange resins, or quaternary amines (e.g., cholestyramine or colestipol)), low density lipoprotein receptor inducers, clofibrate, fenofibrate, benzofibrate, cipofibrate, gemfibrizol, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, anti-oxidant vitamins, β-blockers, anti-diabetes agents, angiotensin II antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, platelet aggregation inhibitors, fibrinogen receptor antagonists, aspirin or fibric acid derivatives. The compounds of the present invention may be employed in combination with additional therapeutic agent(s) selected from one or more, preferably one to three, of the following therapeutic agents in treating cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor, particularly an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Examples of suitable HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors include, but are not limited to, lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and rivastatin. The term HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is intended to include all pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, free acid and lactone forms of compounds which have HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity and, therefore, the use of such salts, esters, free acids and lactone forms is included within the scope of this invention. Compounds which have inhibitory activity for HMG-CoA reductase can be readily identified using assays well-known in the art. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with one or more, preferably one to three, of the following anti-diabetic agents depending on the desired target therapy. Studies indicate that diabetes and hyperlipidemia modulation can be further improved by the addition of a second agent to the therapeutic regimen. Examples of anti-diabetic agents include, but are not limited to, sulfonylureas (such as chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, acetohexamide, tolazamide, glyburide, gliclazide, glynase, glimepiride, and glipizide), biguanides (such as metformin), thiazolidinediones (such as ciglitazone, pioglitazone, troglitazone, and rosiglitazone), and related insulin sensitizers, such as selective and non-selective activators of PPARα, PPARβ and PPARγ; dehydroepiandrosterone (also referred to as DHEA or its conjugated sulphate ester, DHEA-SO4); anti-glucocorticoids; TNFα inhibitors; α-glucosidase inhibitors (such as acarbose, miglitol, and voglibose), pramlintide (a synthetic analog of the human hormone amylin), other insulin secretagogues (such as repaglinide, gliquidone, and nateglinide), insulin, as well as the therapeutic agents discussed above for treating atherosclerosis. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with one or more, preferably one to three, of the following anti-obesity agents selected from phenylpropanolamine, phentermine, diethylpropion, mazindol, fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, phentiramine, β3-adrenoreceptor agonist agents; sibutramine, gastrointestinal lipase inhibitors (such as orlistat), and leptins. Other agents used in treating obesity or obesity-related disorders include neuropeptide Y, enterostatin, cholecytokinin, bombesin, amylin, histamine H3 receptors, dopamine D2 receptor modulators, melanocyte stimulating hormone, corticotrophin releasing factor, galanin and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). The above other therapeutic agents, when employed in combination with the compounds of the present invention may be used, for example, in those amounts indicated in the Physicians' Desk Reference, as in the patents set out above, or as otherwise determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. Particularly when provided as a single dosage unit, the potential exists for a chemical interaction between the combined active ingredients. For this reason, when the compound of the present invention and a second therapeutic agent are combined in a single dosage unit they are formulated such that although the active ingredients are combined in a single dosage unit, the physical contact between the active ingredients is minimized (that is, reduced). For example, one active ingredient may be enteric coated. By enteric coating one of the active ingredients, it is possible not only to minimize the contact between the combined active ingredients, but also, it is possible to control the release of one of these components in the gastrointestinal tract such that one of these components is not released in the stomach but rather is released in the intestines. One of the active ingredients may also be coated with a material that affects a sustained-release throughout the gastrointestinal tract and also serves to minimize physical contact between the combined active ingredients. Furthermore, the sustained-released component can be additionally enteric coated such that the release of this component occurs only in the intestine. Still another approach would involve the formulation of a combination product in which the one component is coated with a sustained and/or enteric release polymer, and the other component is also coated with a polymer such as a low viscosity grade of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or other appropriate materials as known in the art, in order to further separate the active components. The polymer coating serves to form an additional barrier to interaction with the other component. These as well as other ways of minimizing contact between the components of combination products of the present invention, whether administered in a single dosage form or administered in separate forms but at the same time by the same manner, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure. The compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or in combination with one or more, preferably one to three, additional therapeutic agents. By “administered in combination” or “combination therapy” it is meant that the compound of the present invention and one or more, preferably one to three, additional therapeutic agents are administered concurrently to the mammal being treated. When administered in combination, each component may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time. Thus, each component may be administered separately but sufficiently closely in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic effect. The compounds of the present invention are also useful as standard or reference compounds, for example as a quality standard or control, in tests or assays involving the endothelial lipase. Such compounds may be provided in a commercial kit, for example, for use in pharmaceutical research involving endothelial lipase or HDL activity. For example, a compound of the present invention could be used as a reference in an assay to compare its known activity to a compound with an unknown activity. This would ensure the experimenter that the assay was being performed properly and provide a basis for comparison, especially if the test compound was a derivative of the reference compound. When developing new assays or protocols, compounds according to the present invention could be used to test their effectiveness. The compounds of the present invention may also be used in diagnostic assays involving endothelial lipase. The present invention also encompasses an article of manufacture. As used herein, article of manufacture is intended to include, but not be limited to, kits and packages.
