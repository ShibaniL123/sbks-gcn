Compositions for use in stimulating bone growth Technical field of the invention The present invention relates to use of a composition for maintenance of bone and/or cartilage health or prevention, alleviation and/or treatment of bone and/or cartilage disorders. Background of the invention Bone mass evolves throughout life and is regulated by genetic, mechanical and hormonal mechanisms. Bone mineral acquisition occurs during childhood and peak bone mass is achieved around 20 years of age. During this period, bone formation exceeds bone resorption. Later in life, and particularly around the time of the menopause, or in the elderly population, bone mass and quality are impaired due to a higher bone turnover with excessive bone resorption leading to a gradual loss of bone mass, microarchitecture, structure and strength. To maintain bone, it is important to restore the balance between bone formation and bone resorption. This bone remodelling process is regulated at the bone cell level involving a tight interaction between bone forming cells (osteoblasts) and bone resorbing cells (osteoclasts). In a healthy adult, man or animal, the joint action of the osteoblasts and osteoclasts makes possible the maintenance of the bone mass over time and simultaneously ensures remodelling of bone tissue by resorption and de novo synthesis of bone. In a healthy adult, the rate of formation of the osteoclasts and osteoblasts is such that a balance is struck between bone formation and bone resorption. However, in osteoporotic individuals, an imbalance in the process of bone remodelling is produced which culminates in a loss of bone which proceeds at a more rapid rate than the rate of formation. Although this imbalance exists to a certain extent in most individuals as they age, it is much more severe and occurs at a younger age in osteoporotic individuals. Thus, in man and other mammals a great variety of disorders are related to abnormal metabolism of bone resorption and bone formation, leading to an imbalance in metabolism or bone remodelling. Moreover, in man and animals, there are many conditions characterised by the need to increase bone formation. For example, in the case of bone fractures, it is necessary to stimulate bone growth in order to accelerate complete repair of the bone. This need is also present in the periodontal diseases, the metastatic diseases of bone, the osteolytic diseases and the conditions under which repair of the connective tissue is required, for example for the cicatrisation or regeneration of defects or traumatisms of cartilage. The stimulation of bone growth is also required in the case of primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism, as well as in osteoporosis associated with diabetes and in osteoporosis associated with glucocorticoids. Although there exists today a large variety of active compounds for stimulating bone formation and/or inhibiting bone resorption, there is a constant need for new active compounds, in particular owing to the limited success of the current treatments. Another joint disorder is osteoarthrtis, which is a first cause of disability in the elderly. Currently, no cure exists for osteoarthritis and therapy is only palliative aiming at improving symptoms. Summary of the invention In a surprising manner, the applicant has shown that a combination of Vitamin D with hydroxytyrosol and/or oleuropein, which are polyphenols derived from the olive tree, is capable of acting synergistically to stimulate bone formation and/or cartilage anabolism. The combination is able, via stimulation of osteoblast differentiation and activity and collagen synthesis, to stimulate bone formation, as well as cartilage anabolism. The addition of the combination of Vitamin D with either or both oleuropein or hydroxytyrosol results in a stimulation of osteoblasts which is both increased in strength, and moved forward in time (i.e the stimulation is elicited earlier than with either component on its own). In the context of this application, the effect of addition of Vitamin D is referred to as "potentiating" the effect of polyphenols on bone formation and/or cartilage anabolism. Thus, the invention in a first aspect relates to a composition comprising Vitamin D for use to potentiate the effects of one or more polyphenols on bone formation and/or cartilage anabolism. In a further aspect the invention relates to a composition comprising vitamin D and one or more polyphenols for use to potentiate the stimulation of bone formation and/or cartilage anabolism by said polyphenols. In a further aspect the invention relates to composition for use according to the invention comprising vitamin D and one or more polyphenols is administered at least once per day, for a time period of at least 2 months, preferably at least 3 months. In a further aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising Vitamin D and one or more polyphenols. In yet a further aspect, the invention relates to a method of treatment, alleviation and/or prophylaxis of a bone and/or cartilagedisorder, comprising administering an effective amount of Vitamin D in combination with one or more polyphenols to an individual in need thereof.

Detailed description of the invention Definitions Prior to discussing the present invention in further details, the following terms and conventions will first be defined: In the context of the present invention, mentioned percentages are weight/weight percentages unless otherwise stated. The term "and/or" used in the context of the "X and/or Y" should be interpreted as "X", or "Y", or "X and Y". Numerical ranges as used herein are intended to include every number and subset of numbers contained within that range, whether specifically disclosed or not. Further, these numerical ranges should be construed as providing support for a claim directed to any number or subset of numbers in that range. For example, a disclosure of from 1 to 10 should be construed as supporting a range of from 1 to 8, from 3 to 7, from 4 to 9, from 3.6 to 4.6, from 3.5 to 9.9, and so forth. All references to singular characteristics or limitations of the present invention shall include the corresponding plural characteristic or limitation, and vice versa, unless otherwise specified or clearly implied to the contrary by the context in which the reference is made. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. Composition comprising Vitamin D for use Polyphenols have previously been shown to have beneficial effects on inflammation and bone metabolism. The inventors have surprisingly shown that the combination of Vitamin D with one or more polyphenols, such as one or more of ΗΤ and OLP, potentiates the stimulating effects of these polyphenols on bone formation and/or cartilage anabolism (see Example 2 and discussion thereof, and Figure 2). By "stimulation of bone formation and/or cartilage anabolism" is meant the capacity of the combination of Vitamin D, oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol to stimulate the activity of osteoblasts and thus promote the synthesis of the protein networks of bone and/or cartilage. This leads to the deposition of minerals, in particular calcium, in these protein networks, i.e. to stimulate the mineralisation of the bone, also called bone formation, and to the stimulation of cartilage anabolism. By "potentiate the stimulating effects of the polyphenols" is meant that the stimulating effect of the one or more polyphenols is both increased in strength and brought forward in time (i.e. elicited earlier than in the absence of Vitamin D) by the addition of Vitamin D. Thus, the invention in a first aspect relates to a composition comprising Vitamin D for use to potentiate the effects of one or more polyphenols on bone formation and/or cartilage anabolism. The polyphenols may be for example one or more of oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol. Vitamin D may be present in any suitable form. Various useful forms of vitamin D are available including, for example, cholecalciferol (D3), ergocalciferol (D2), and their biologically active metabolites and precursors such as, 1-alpha-hydroxy Vitamin D, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, 1 , 25-dihydroxy vitamin D and the like. In one embodiment of this aspect of the invention, Vitamin D may be provided simultaneously with, or sequentially to the provision of the one or more polyphenols. The Vitamin D may be provided in the same composition as the one or more polyphenols, or may be provided in separate compositions, for example in a kit of parts, or a series of interacting products. If the Vitamin D and the one or more polyphenols are presented in one or more separate compositions, they may be mixed prior to administration, or may be administered simultaneously or sequentially. The potentiating effect of Vitamin D is evident already in combination with a single polyphenol, such as in combination with oleuropein or hydroxytyrosol. The potentiating effect is even further increased when Vitamin D is given in combination with both oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol. In a further aspect, the invention relates to use of Vitamin D in the manufacture of a composition or medicament, to potentiate the effects of one or more polyphenols on bone formation and/or cartilage anabolism. Composition for use In a further aspect, the invention relates to a composition comprising vitamin D and one or more polyphenols for use to potentiate the stimulation of bone formation and/or cartilage anabolism by said polyphenols. The polyphenols may be for example olive polyphenols, such as for example polyphenols selected from the group consisting of oleuropein, ligstroside, hydroxytyrosol and or tyrosol.

In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method for the treatment, alleviation and/or prophylaxis of a disorder linked to an imbalance in bone metabolism, in particular a disorder associated with loss of bone mass, said method comprising a step of administering a therapeutically efficacious quantity of Vitamin D and one or more polyphenols, or a pharmaceutical composition containing Vitamin D and one or more polyphenols, to an individual in need thereof. In one embodiment, the method of treatment according to the invention concerns treatment, alleviation and/or prophylaxis of osteoarthritis. The methods of treatment according to the invention may be in a mammal, such as a human, or a pet, for example a dog, a cat and/or a horse. In certain embodiments the composition of the invention to be administered in the method of treatment, may be one or more nutritional compositions of the invention and/or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Dosage regime The invention relates to the surprising finding that the combination of Vitamin D with one or more polyphenols, such as hydroxytyrosol and/or oleuropein, potentiates the bone formation and/or cartilage anabolism effect of said polyphenols. The combination can both increase the effect of the polyphenols, and elicit and earlier response from the osteoblasts. Thus, compositions of the invention may be useful in treatment with shorter durations, in contrast to the long term treatment times used for conventional treatments of e.g. ostoearthritis. Therefore, the invention also relates to a use according to the invention, wherein a composition of the invention is administered at least once a day for a time period of at least 1 month, such as at least 2 months, preferably at least 3 months. In other embodiments the invention relates to a use according to the invention, wherein a composition is administered at least once a day for at least 1 month. It should be noted that embodiments and features described in the context of one of the aspects of the present invention also apply to the other aspects of the invention. All patent and non-patent references cited in the present application, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. The invention will now be described in further details in the following non-limiting examples. Examples Example 1- Collagen synthesis by osteoblasts Primary osteoblasts were isolated from the calvaria of newborn Wistar rats by enzymatic digestion as described by Declercq et al. in 2004. During all experiments, cells were maintained in a-minimal essential medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin / streptomycin under conditions of 5% C02 and 37°C. Cells were seeded on Coll-l-coated 96-well plates at a density of 3500 cells/ well or in 24-well plates at a density of 3x104 cells/well and cultured for 2 days in α -MEM to reach confluence. Cells were then exposed to different conditions: minimal medium (C-), minimal medium containing 50 pg/ml ascorbic acid, 5 η∩Μ p-glycerophosphate (C+; optimized medium), and minimal medium supplemented with 1 μΜ Oleuropein (OLP) or / and 1μΜ Hydroxytyrosol (HTy) or / and 10-9 Μ 1,25 dihydroxivitamin D3 (l,25(OH)2D3). OLP and HTy were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and l,25(OH)2D3 was dissolved in ethanol. The final concentrations of DMSO and ethanol in the medium were 0.1% each. The medium was changed every 2 days. After 9 days, cellular collagen content was measured using the Sircol Assay from Biocolor. This Sircol Collagen Assay is a quantitative dye-binding method designed for the analysis of collagens extracted from mammalian tissues and cells during in vitro culture. The dye reagent binds specifically to the [Gly-X-Y]n helical structure found in mammalian collagens (Types I-V). Figure 1 shows collagen synthesis by osteoblasts after 9 days of culture, measured by micrograms of collagen produced per milligram of total protein in response to stimulation with a combination of l,25(OH)2D3 OLP and HTy. l,25(OH)2D3 = 10-9 Μ 1,25 dihydroxivitamin D3; OLP = 1 μΜ Oleuropein; HTy = 1μΜ Hydroxytyrosol; C+ = optimized medium use as positive control. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM (3 replicates). Statistics: Kruskal Wallis test followed by Mann Whitney U test (2 tailed) *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001 vs negative control (C-) As is shown in Figure 1, the addition of a combination of l,25(OH)2D3, OLP and HTy stimulates significantly the cellular collagen synthesis of the osteoblasts after 9 days of culture. Example 2- Alkaline phosphatase activity of osteoblasts Primary osteoblasts were isolated from the calvaria of newborn Wistar rats by enzymatic digestion as described by Declercq et al. in 2004. During all experiments, cells were maintained in a-minimal essential medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin / streptomycin under conditions of 5% C02 and 37°C. Cells were seeded on Coll-l-coated 96-well plates at a density of 3500 cells/ well or in 24-well plates at a density of 3χ104 cells/well and cultured for 2 days in α-ΜΕΜ to reach confluence. Cells were then exposed to different conditions: minimal medium (C-), minimal medium containing 50 pg/ml ascorbic acid, 5 η∩Μ p-glycerophosphate (C+; optimized medium), and minimal medium supplemented with 1 μΜ Oleuropein (OLP) or / and 1μΜ Hydroxytyrosol (HTy) or / and 10"9 Μ 1,25 dihydroxivitamin D3 (l,25(OH)2D3). OLP and HTy were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and l,25(OH)2D3 was dissolved in ethanol. The final concentrations of DMSO and ethanol in the medium were 0.1% each. The medium was changed every 2 days. Enzymatic activity of Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) was measured kinetically on Treatment Days 0, 5, 9, 12 and 15. Osteoblasts were rinsed twice with PBS before being frozen on dry ice. The cells were then lysed by freeze-thaw cycle and homogenization into 200 μ1 of 1 Μ diethanolamine and 0.24 η∩Μ magnesium chloride buffer pH 9.8 (ALP buffer). Cell lysates (10 μ1) were added to 200 μ1 of 6mg/ml solution of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (ρ-ΝΡΡ) in ALP buffer. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm and 30°C, and every 2 min 30 s for 30 min using a VarioSklan Flash microplate reader. ALP activity was expressed as micromoles of ρ-ΝΡΡ per hour per milligram of protein. Protein measurement was performed in accordance with the method of Bradford using Quick Start BioRad protein assay. Figure 2 shows alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity after 9 days of culture, indicated by micromolar ALP per milligram of protein per hour in response to with a combination of l,25(OH)2D3, OLP and HTy. C- = minimal medium use as negative control; l,25(OH)2D3 = 10"9 Μ 1,25 dihydroxivitamin D3; OLP = 1 μΜ Oleuropein; HTy = 1μΜ Hydroxytyrosol; C+ = optimized medium use as positive control. Data were expressed as mean ±SEM. Statistics: Kruskal Wallis test followed by Mann Whitney U test (2 tailed) *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001 vs negative control (C-). Figure 2 further demonstrates that the addition of a combination of l,25(OH)2D3, OLP and HTy stimulates significantly the cellular collagen synthesis of the osteoblasts after 9 days of culture. Figures 3 to 6 shows Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity of osteoblasts cultured in the presence of l,25(OH)2D3, oleuropein (OLP), hydroxytyrosol (Hyt); separately or in combinations in a time course model. C- = minimal medium use as negative control; 1,25(ΟΗ)2ϋ3 = 10"9 Μ 1,25 dihydroxivitamin D3; OLP = 1 μΜ Oleuropein; HTy = 1μΜ Hydroxytyrosol; C+ = optimized medium use as positive control. Data were expressed as mean ±SEM. Statistics: Kruskal Wallis test followed by Mann Whitney U test (2 tailed) *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001 vs negative control (C-). Conclusions As can be seen from the data shown in Figure 3, the addition of Vitamin D3 in itself does induce a small but statistically significant increase in ΑΡ activity on day 15, indicative of osteoblast activity and bone formation and/or cartilage anabolism. In the same manner, the addition of either ΗΤ on its own or OLP on its own also results in a small increase on day 15, comparable with the effect of Vitamin D3 (see respective figures). Combining both ΗΤ and OLP does also increase the osteoblast activity (again, looking at day 15), but not as much as combining Vitamin D with either ΗΤ or OLP. Still, the only points with statistically significant difference from control are day 12 and day 15. Earlier measurements, at day 5 and day 9, do not differ statistically from negative control. Thus, the data presented illustrate two effects of addition of Vitamin D. Firstly, the addition of Vitamin D together with either one or both of the ΗΤ and OLP increases the osteoblast response. This is seen in comparison of for example levels at Day 15. Secondly, the addition of Vitamin D together with either one or both of the ΗΤ and OLP elicits osteoblast activity earlier than in the co. The conclusion is that addition of Vitamin D leads to an earlier response, and a stronger response. It is concluded that addition of Vitamin D potentiates the bone formation and/or cartilage anabolism response elicited by OLP and/or ΗΤ. 1.
