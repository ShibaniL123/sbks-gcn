Step 4
Under ice-cooling, to Compound 202 (100 mg, 0.189 mmol) in dichloromethane (2 mL) solution were added triphenylphosphine (99 mg, 0.378 mmol) and carbon tetrabromide (125 mg, 0.378 mmol), the mixture was stirred under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 50 minutes. Then, 2 mol/L dimethylamine in THF solution (0.946 mL, 1.89 mmol) was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes. Water was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by amino silica gel column chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 203 (95.6 mg, 91% yield) as yellow foam.
