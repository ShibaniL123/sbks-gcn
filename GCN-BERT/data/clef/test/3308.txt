METHOD FOR TREATING OR ENHANCING MUSCLE TISSUE CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to South African provisional patent application number 2014/01988, which is incorporated by reference herein. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to the use of Prosopis glandulosa for treating and enhancing muscle tissue. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION From accumulating scientific evidence, it is apparent that the phyto-chemicals present in herbal substances have beneficial effects on long-term human health and can be used to effectively treat various diseases. Numerous studies have shown that antioxidants, such as found in herbal preparations, can result in prolonged performance in endurance exercise, by decreasing oxidative stress [Zheng et al., 2012; Chen et al., 201 1 ; Bucci, 2000] as well as aiding in the muscle regenerative process, resulting in accelerated muscle recovery following muscle injury. Korean ginseng is one example of a herbal preparation shown to enhance exercise and sport performance [Chen et al., 201 1 ; Bucci, 2000; Wang et al., 2010], and a grape-seed derived polyphenol, for example, has recently been described as providing accelerated skeletal muscle recovery [Myburgh et al., 2012; Kruger et al., 2014]. However, the abilities of many herbal remedies to enhance exercise and sport performance or reduce inflammation, as a result of injury, are based on anecdotal claims and lack scientific evidence. Therefore, as a result, many people experience unpleasant or undesirable side effects, due to incorrect dosage and interaction with other prescription medication, when taking commercially available herbal supplements which are unresearched. In addition, synthetic pharmaceuticals are also known for enhancing sport performance or recovery. However many of these (such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are not permitted in competitive sports.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The use of plant material from the Prosopis glandulosa (Torr.) [Fabaceae] tree (commonly known as Honey mesquite) is described herein. The plant material is typically the dried and ground pods from the tree, but could also be from other parts of the tree, such as the leaves, bark or roots. Due to their high protein content, the pods of P. glandulosa have traditionally been used as a food or general food supplement by the residents of the south-western regions of the North American deserts [Simpson, 1977; Zimmermann, 1991 ]. This plant species was commonly found in the dry, arid regions of the northern and north-western Cape, South Africa [Jurriaanse, 1973; Harding, 1987], but due to its invasive potential is now classified as a category 2 invader under the Conservation of Agricultural Resources Act of 1983 (Act No. 43 of 1983) [Zimmermann, 1991 ]. Very few studies have been conducted on the P. glandulosa plant and the only literature which could be found regarding its potential clinical benefits were from the Applicant's own studies relating to diabetes and cardiovascular health [26,27, George et al., 201 1 ; Huisamen et al., 2012]. The Applicant is not aware of any literature on the effect of P. glandulosa on force generation, fatigue tolerance or muscle recovery after injury. The Applicant has now found that administration of P. glandulosa results in an increase in muscle strength and is also effective in pre- and/or post-injury treatment of muscle injury and inflammation. Material from P. glandulosa could therefore be useful for aiding sporting ability, in a dietary or nutritional supplement for enhancing muscle function or performance, as a preventative chronic supplement for preventing or minimising muscle injury or as an acute therapeutic application for treating or speeding up recovery after an injury. Soft tissue injuries are very common, accounting for between 35% and 55% of all sporting injuries [1 ]. Soft tissue injuries can result in significant pain, swelling and bruising, culminating in delayed and impaired functionality of the affected muscle [2]. The pathophysiology of muscle injuries is a complex process, progressing through a sequence of overlapping phases, which include degeneration, inflammation, regeneration and the formation of fibrotic scar tissue [3,4,5,6]. Injuries to skeletal muscle not only damage the muscle cells, but may also lead to capillary rupture, infiltrative bleeding, inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis, depending on the extent of the injury. Inflammation stands central to these processes, with inflammatory cytokines largely responsible for modulating the cellular environment, thereby largely controlling the progress of other repair processes. In recent years, researchers have focused on manipulation of inflammation to accelerate muscle regeneration, for example, by targeting immune cells activated during the inflammatory phase [7,8]. Neutrophils and macrophages enter the site of injury in response to chemotactic signals and phagocytize the local debris [5,9,10]. Neutrophils, along with macrophages and satellite cells, release oxygen free radicals, resulting in oxidative stress and direct damage to surrounding tissue unaffected by the primary injury, which results in secondary muscle damage. However, even though early stage phenotypes of macrophages partially contributes to the sustainability of the inflammatory response and thus also secondary damage, these cells also secrete various growth factors that directly contribute to tissue repair and regeneration [5,1 1 ]. Additionally, both neutrophils and macrophages stimulate the release of cytokines (IL-1 , IL-6, IL-8) and other chemotactic factors by T-cells, which inevitably results in the recruitment of satellite cells, with thus a greater capacity for muscle regeneration [5,12,13]. It is therefore clear that the inflammatory response, even though a contributor to secondary damage, is crucial to the repair of skeletal muscle after injury. Thus in the event of this total process being severely blunted for a prolonged period of time, such as through non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment, the potential clinical outcome may be suboptimal, resulting in delayed and/or incomplete tissue healing, as well as excessive scar formation, which increases the risk for recurrence of injury. There is evidence that suggests that the prolonged inhibition of the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway (more than 7 days continually) with prostaglandin inhibitors (NSAIDs) compromises muscle repair [4,14,15]. In addition to the use of NSAID's, there are various other muscle injury treatment options, such as the RICE approach (rest, ice, compression and elevation) [4,16,17,18], therapeutic ultrasound [19,20], hyperbaric oxygen therapy [21 ] and the use of growth factors [22]. However, these therapies remain suboptimal, as in many instances it either does not translate into increased myotube formation, therefore does not enhance muscle healing [19,20] and may be associated with severe risks and side effects [23]. Physical fatigue, also referred to as peripheral fatigue, is denoted as the deterioration of muscle performance during prolonged activity [Roots et al., 2008; Fitts, 1994]. This decrease in force is reversible, as muscle performance can be recovered after sufficient rest and appropriate nutrition. The magnitude of muscle force generation is determined by two main factors, namely, (i) the size of the muscle recruited to generate the force and (ii) the muscle fiber type [Maughan et al., 1983; Lee et al., 2013]. Force generation during contraction is related to the number of cross- links made between the actin and myosin chains [Fitts et al., 1991 ]. Therefore, the more crosslinks formed, the stronger the force of contraction. Hence, the maximal force of contraction depends upon the number of fibers a muscle contains. The type of fibers also plays an important role, as different types of muscle fibers possess different contractile properties [Schaiffino and Reggiani, 201 1 ]. It is known that a muscle composed of a high proportion of slow-twitch (Type I) fibers will be relatively weaker than a muscle of similar size with a high proportion of fast-twitch (Type II) fibers. Fiber composition is regulated in response to changes in physical activity, environment and pathological conditions [Schiaffino et al., 2007], for example, endurance exercise training induces a fast-to-slow fiber type transition, transforming the myofibers to an increased oxidative metabolism [Demirel et al., 1999; Pette and Staron, 2001 ; Yuan et al., 201 1 ]. Additional factors leading to fiber type transition include mechanical loading and unloading, hormones and aging [Pette and Staron, 2001 ]. The data from this study indicates that P. glandulosa treatment might prove beneficial as a supplement, aiding physical ability, and results in more effective muscle repair after contusion injury than without treatment or with NSAID treatment. The fact that P. glandulosa is categorized as an invader tree in South Africa, and possibly in other countries too, illustrates the ethnopharmacological significance of these findings. The use of an economical, natural and readily available substance as treatment, could have far-reaching implications in not only the sporting arena and health sector, but also in plant and wildlife conservation. The invention will now be described in more detail by way of the following non-limiting examples. Example 1 : Preventative and therapeutic application of P. glandulosa for soft tissue injuries P. glandulosa as a possible pre- and/or post-injury treatment option after a contusion injury was studied. Effects on neutrophil and macrophage infiltration into the injured area were investigated, as well as associated consequences in the context of muscle regeneration. A recognized NSAID commonly used in the treatment of muscle injury and inflammation (diclofenac) was used as a comparative control. Materials and methods Animals Age- and weight-matched adult, male, Wistar rats were divided into four main groups, namely: (1 ) control placebo (PLA); (2) PG-CHR, animals treated with P. glandulos for 8 weeks prior to injury and after injury, up to the time of sacrifice; (3) PG-AI, animals treated with P. glandulosa after injury (first treatment, 2 h after injury), up to the time of sacrifice and (4) NSAID, animals treated with Voltaren Emulgel® (diclofenac) directly after injury, up to the time of sacrifice. All four groups were subdivided into sacrifice and data collection time points of t = 0 h (before injury), 1 h, 3 h, 1 day and 7 days, post-injury. Each main group had an n = 25, i.e., 5 rats per time point per group (total of 100 rats). Rats in the different experimental groups were matched for body mass at the start of the protocol (PLA: 456.47 ± 9.74 g; PG-CHR: 445.98 ± 1 1 .21 g; PG-AI: 439.12 ± 14.84 g; NSAID: 442.25 ± 12.58 g). P. Glandulosa and diclofenac treatments P. glandulosa powder consisting solely of dry-milled P. glandulosa pods was used in this experiment [26]. To prepare treatment, P. glandulosa powder from P. Schoeman was weighed daily for each animal in the treatment group and set into a mixture of commercially available gelatine/jelly cubes of 1 mL volume. These jelly cubes were fed to each animal individually for 8 weeks, to ensure absolute compliance and dose control. The dosage of 100 mg/kg/day P. glandulosa was calculated based on the daily dosage prescribed for human adults on a commercially available food supplement. This dose has previously been shown by the Applicant to elicit beneficial metabolic changes in rats [26,27]. During the 8-week experimental period, the control animals received placebo jelly cubes. Diclofenac, a known NSAID, served as a positive control for the anti-inflammatory effects of treatment. Diclofenac sodium, in the form of Voltaren Emulgel® from Novartis, was applied topically to the injured area on the hindlimb of the rats after different time periods post-injury. The dosage of Voltaren Emulgel® was calculated at 57.14 mg/kg/day, which was equal to 0.57 mg/kg Diclofenac. The dosage was calculated based on the daily dosage prescribed for human adults. Induction of experimental muscle contusion injury and sample collection The contusion injury to the rat hind-limb was produced using the mass-drop model injury first described by Stratton et al. (1984) [28] and optimized for our laboratory by Myburgh and colleagues (2012) [7]. Briefly, the technique entails dropping a 200 g weight from the height of 50 cm onto the medial surface of the right gastrocnemius muscle of sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) anaesthetized rats. This contusion injury was moderately severe, did not result in bone injury or affect gait in the injured animals. For sample collection, rats were euthanized by sodium pentobarbital overdose (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and the central section of the damaged gastrocnemius muscle harvested. The harvested muscle was divided into two parts, one part processed for immunohistochemistry and the other part snap-frozen for Western blotting analysis. Muscle histology and immunohistochemistry For cross-sectional histology and immunohistochemistry, muscles were fixed in 10% formal saline, processed and embedded in paraffin wax. Five-micrometer thick cross-sections were prepared (Leica RM 2125 RT microtome, Nussloch, Germany) and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H & E) for qualitative histological analysis. Immunostaining with mouse anti-rat His48 (neutrophil; 1 :200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), goat anti-mouse F4/80 (macrophage; 1 :200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and rabbit anti-human desmin (1 :200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) antibodies was performed on the fully automated Leica Bond-Max Autostainer system (Leica Microsystems, Germany) using an onboard detection kit, which included the Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution, peroxide block, primary antibody, post primary reagent, Bond Wash solution and Bond Polymer [29,30]. DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride) was used as the chromogen (Leica Microsystems, Germany). Appropriate positive controls were used throughout the study. Image analysis All imaging data were obtained by analyzing two sections from each muscle sample, at each time point for each antibody. In the injured area, five fields of view per section were imaged using a microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE E400; 400x objective used), equipped with a color digital camera (Nikon 5.0 Mega Pixels Color Digital Camera head DS-Fi2). The images presented in this article are only partial images of those taken at 200χ magnification. Photos were used to count positively labeled neutrophils, macrophages and desmin-stains. Immune cells were counted manually and expressed as the average number of positively labeled immune cells per field of view (350 μηι2) in the injured area, using the NIS-Elements BR imaging software package. In order for a cell to be classified a true neutrophil and macrophage, it had to have multilobular nuclei or single nuclei with surrounding cytoplasm, respectively. Western blotting Protein levels were determined by standard Western blotting technique [26]. Briefly, proteins were extracted from the gastrocnemius muscle tissue, equal concentration of total protein loaded and separated on a SDS poly-acrylamide gel and electro-transferred to ImmobilonTM-P PVDF membranes. Ponceau red reversible stain was used to determine transfer efficacy of proteins. The membranes were incubated overnight in ADAM12 primary antibody (1 :5000; Abeam, England, UK). For detection, horseradish peroxidase coupled secondary antibody (1 :4000; Amersham Life Sciences, Sandton, JHB, South Africa) was used. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using ECL detection reagent (Amersham Life Sciences, Sandton, JHB, South Africa) and exposed to an autoradiography film (Hyperfilm ECL, RPN 2103) and light emission was detected. All films were analyzed by means of densitometry (UN-SCAN-IT; Silk Scientific Inc., Utah, UT, USA) and normalized data expressed in arbitrary units (AU). In all instances the membranes were stripped, by incubating in 0.2 M NaOH and reblotted with antibody against β-tubulin (1 :1000; Cell Signalling Technology, Beverley, MA, USA) to verify the uniformity of protein load across the test samples. Statistical analysis All data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was analyzed by a two-way ANOVA, followed by a Bonferroni post hoc test p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Statistical analysis of data was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5. Results Chronic P. alandulosa treatment accelerates repair of muscle ultrastructure Qualitative microscopic analysis of the fiber architecture post-contusion injury indicated that irrespective of treatment, the blunt force to the muscle belly significantly damaged and disrupted the skeletal muscle fibers, resulting in red blood cell accumulation in the interstitial spaces at 1 h and 3 h after injury (Figure 1 B,E,H,K). Representative pictures for 1 h after injury are not included as differences between 1 and 3 h post-injury cannot be easily discerned visually. Edema was present in both treated and untreated groups, confirmed by the widening of the interstitial spaces between the fibers at this early time point. Histological comparison between the placebo (PLA) and the treatment groups illustrated a significant influx of immune cells 1 day after injury in all four groups. However, this influx was relatively limited in the group chronically treated with P. glandulosa (PG-CHR), when compared to all other groups. The immune cells remained visible in the injured area of the PLA, post-injury treated group (PG-AI) and the non- steroidal anti-inflammatory treated (NSAID) groups for up to day 7 post-injury (Figure 1 D,J,M), but were undetectable in the PG-CHR group at the same time point (Figure 1 G). By day 7 only the chronically treated P. glandulosa group (Figure 1 G) displayed near normal muscle architecture, indicative of successful progressing muscle regeneration. P. alandulosa treatment blunted the neutrophil response to contusion injury Clear differences were evident between the various experimental groups with regards to neutrophil infiltration. No neutrophils were present in the any of the experimental groups before injury, whereas contusion injury resulted in a significant (between 30- and 40-fold) transient elevation in neutrophils on day 1 after injury, which normalised by day 7 post-injury (p < 0.0001 ) (Figure 2). On day 1 post-injury, the PG-CHR (p < 0.0001 ), PG-AI (p < 0.001 ) as well as the NSAID treatment groups (p < 0.0001 ) displayed a significantly lower number of neutrophils compared to the untreated group (PLA). Furthermore, the magnitude of the neutrophil response as assessed on day 1 post-injury was similar in these three treatments groups. P. alandulosa treatment did not affect macrophage response to contusion injury Similar to the neutrophil data, the presence of macrophages was undetectable in the uninjured control samples (Figure 3). Of the time-points assessed, the peak number of macrophages (p < 0.001 ) present in the injured area, was 1 day after injury in all four experimental groups. These increased values had again normalised by day 7 after injury (p < 0.001 ). None of the treatments seem to have any effect on macrophage infiltration at the time points assessed. ADAM p expression is enhanced in response to chronic P. alandulosa treatment According to the Western blot analysis, expression of the satellite cell proliferation marker, ADAM12, was significantly elevated from 3 h post-injury (p < 0.0001 ) and this significant elevation persisted for at least 24 h (p < 0.0001 ), with the expression again normalized to uninjured levels on day 7 after injury, in all experimental groups (p < 0.0001 ) (Figure 4A,B). Of all three treatments assessed, the 8-week chronic treatment with P. glandulosa (PG-CHR) showed the most significant effect with significantly increased (p < 0.05) expression of ADAM12, on day 1 post-injury, when compared to the PLA group. Although post-injury treatment (PG-AI) seemed to suppress ADAM12 expression at 3 h, when compared to PLA, it was associated with a significant increase in ADAM12 expression from 3 to 1 day. NSAID treatment was associated with a similarly suppressed ADAM12 expression at 3 h, but with this treatment, the relative suppression persisted at 1 day after injury. Indeed, the NSAID group expressed lower levels of ADAM12 compared to the chronically treated P. glandulosa group at both 3 h and 1 day post- injury, significantly so on the latter (p < 0.001 ). For the sake of clarity, the statistical differences observed between the different time-points in each experimental group is illustrated in Figure 4C. Desmin expression is increased in response to chronic P. alandulosa treatment Desmin expression was found to steadily increase after injury, with highest values at the 7 days post-injury time point, in all four different experimental groups. At the 7-day post-injury time- point, the chronically treated P. glandulosa group (PG-CHR) displayed significantly elevated desmin expression compared to all other groups (Figure 5). While post-injury P. glandulosa- treatment had no effect on the expression of desmin, the NSAID-treated group displayed significantly decreased desmin expression, when compared to all other groups, indicative of delayed regeneration. Discussion Chronic P. glandulosa treatment was found to significantly reduce neutrophil infiltration into the injured area, suggestive of a decreased pro-inflammatory signal and probably less neutrophil- associated secondary damage. In support of this interpretation, an associated significant increase in the expression of ADAM12 (day 1 post-injury) and desmin (day 7 post-injury) was observed, suggesting an enhanced regenerative process. Large differences between P. glandulosa treatment and the NSAID treatment were evident. The level of ADAM12 expression in gastrocnemius muscles, at different time-points after injury, has not been previously measured in an in vivo model. The fact that chronic P. glandulosa treatment increased the ADAM12 expression at early time-points relative to the PLA indicates that the treatment may facilitate more effective recovery by enhancing early proliferation. In stark contrast, the NSAID treatment resulted in significantly suppressed ADAM12 expression (particularly at 3 h), pointing to an inhibitory effect on repair. This undesired effect was also evident from the desmin response. Desmin levels usually increase significantly during myogenesis and remain elevated in newly matured myofibers [49], which explains the relative late response in our protocol time course. On day 7, and in accordance with the other data suggesting more effective muscle fiber repair, desmin expression was significantly higher after chronic P. glandulosa treatment. In contrast, desmin expression was significantly lower than PLA after NSAID treatment, again pointing to an inhibitory effect of NSAID on repair, as suggested in the literature [3] Example 2: Effect of P. glandulosa on muscle strength The effects of P. glandulosa were studied by electrically stimulating the isolated soleus muscle from rats to fatigue and the extent of recovery was determined after the fatigue period as well as the magnitude of force development with and without P. glandulosa treatment. Materials and Methods Chemicals All chemicals used were purchased from Merck (Pty) Ltd, South Africa. The P. glandulosa preparation was as described in Example 1 . Prosopis glandulosa treatment regime Rats were treated with P. glandulosa powder at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day for a total period of 10 weeks. P. glandulosa was weighed daily for each animal in the treatment group and set in a mixture of commercially available gelatine/ jelly cubes of 1 ml volume. These jelly cubes were fed to each animal individually, to ensure absolute compliance and dose control. The dosage of 100 mg/kg/day P. glandulosa was calculated based on the daily dosage prescribed for human adults, which has previously been shown by the Applicant to elicit metabolic changes [George et al., 201 1 ; Huisamen et al., 2012]. To accustom the animals to the researcher and the taste of the jelly cubes, all animals were fed placebo jelly cubes (jelly cubes without P. glandulosa) for 1 week prior to the start of the actual treatment program. During the 8 weeks experimental period, the control animals received placebo jelly cubes. Division into groups Age and weight matched male Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups: a control placebo group (PLA), that received normal rat chow pellets and jelly cubes without P. glandulosa and a P. glandulosa group (PG) that received normal rat chow and P. glandulosa mixed into jelly cubes (n = 10 in each group). A total of 20 isolated muscles were utilized, i.e. 10 animals per experimental group (treatment vs. no treatment). Sacrifice and sample collection After 10-weeks of P. glandulosa treatment, the animals were weighed (to determine body mass) and then received an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). The animals were continually monitored until loss of consciousness was reached, indicated by a total lack of response after a foot pinch. Muscle fatigue stimulation protocol Skeletal muscle fatigue was determined by methods previously described by Gordon et al. (2010) and El-Khoury et al. (2012). After the animals were euthanized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), one of the soleus muscles, with tendinous insertions intact, were removed and placed in ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB). The KHB solution contained in mM: NaCI 1 19, KCI 4.74, CaCI2.2H20 1 .25, MgS04.7H20 0.6, KH2P04 1 .2, NaHC03 24.9, Na2S04 0.6 and glucose 10. The intact soleus muscle was then removed from the cold KHB buffer and vertically suspended between a pair of platinum electrodes in a 25 ml water-jacketed organ bath containing KHB solution. The KHB was continuously gassed (95% 02/5% C02) to maintain the pH at 7.4 and the temperature of the KHB was kept at 25°C. The physiological stability of rat skeletal muscle in vitro is temperature-dependent and stability for muscle strips of 1 -2mm diameter is better at 25 °C compared to the in vivo temperature of 37 °C [Segal et al., 1986]. The base of the muscle was fixed to an immobile hook and the other end tied to an isometric force transducer. The position of the force transducer could be adjusted by a micro-positioner, thus altering preload. The muscles were left to stabilize for 30 minutes before electrical stimulation commenced. After an equilibration period of 30 min, the optimal length (i.e. muscle length producing maximal isometric twitch force) and supramaximal voltage were determined. These parameters were determined for each muscle by generating single twitch contractions at increasing muscle lengths and voltages, respectively, until no increase in single-twitch force production was observed. The muscle length and voltage that generated the highest single twitch amplitude was then used throughout the entire stimulation protocol. The pulse duration was set to 1 msec for all twitch and tetanic contractions. The stimulation protocol consisted of the generation of a single twitch, force frequency curve to determine Fmax, tetanus, a 2 minute stimulation period to determine fatigue resistance and ended off with two sets of tetanus stimulations at 5 and 20 minutes after fatigue. Fmax was determined using brief, repeated stimulations at increasing pulse frequencies (1 , 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 Hz for 3 sec allowing a 2 min recovery interval between each stimulus). The greatest force achieved for each animal using this protocol was considered the Fmax. Following a 10 min resting period after Fmax determination, muscle fatigue rate was determined over a 2 minute period of intermittent contractions, stimulating the muscle for 2 seconds on and 2 seconds off at a frequency of 40 Hz (predetermined to be Fmax). Force was measured at 20 second intervals during fatigue. Twitch amplitude (force), contraction time (time to peak tension) and half-relaxation time (time for peak force to decay by 50%) were determined before (BF) and after (AF) the fatigue protocol. Contraction time (time to peak tension) was defined as the time elapsed from the base to the peak of a single twitch. Half-relaxation time was defined as the time elapsed from the peak of a single twitch to the point of the twitch amplitude returning halfway to baseline. All muscle function data were collected through an AD Instruments Bridge Amp and Powerlab 4/30, and analyzed with Chart5 PowerLab software (ADInstruments, Inc., Colorado Springs, CO). Specific force was calculated in N/cm2 of muscle cross-sectional area. The latter was approximated by dividing the dry-weight of the muscle by the product of optimal length and muscle density (assumed to be 1 .056 g/cm3). The force transducer was calibrated using known weights. The contraction time and half-relaxation time were measured as indices of isometric twitch kinetics. For the fatigue protocol, values were normalized by expressing the force generated at each 20 second time point, as a percentage of the initial force at the beginning of the fatigue trial. Statistical analysis All data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance between two groups was assessed via a Student t-test and between two or more groups, a two-way ANOVA was used, followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc test, p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Statistical analysis of data was performed using GraphPad Prism 5. Results Effect of P. glandulosa treatment on body mass and muscle biometrics Rats were matched for body mass at the onset of the 10 week P. glandulosa treatment and treatment was found to have no effect on weight gain. Skeletal muscle biometrics (mass, optimal length and width), which is a key determinant of the force output, displayed no significant differences between the treated and untreated groups (Table 1 ). In essence, the soleus muscles of the PLA and PG where biometrically similar. Table 1 : Biometric characteristics of the experimental animals after P. glandulosa treatment The data are expressed as mean ± SEM; Analysis by Student t-test; n = 10 Contractile properties of soleus muscle The induction of muscle fatigue resulted in the significant reduction in both twitch- and peak tetanic force generated by the soleus muscle, when comparing PLA (BF) to PLA (AF) and PG (BF) to PG (AF).Therefore, as a consequence, the twitch/tetanus ratio was significantly reduced after fatigue compared to before fatigue. Despite fatigue ensuing, the contraction time was unaffected by P. glanulosa treatment, remaining constant throughout.Ten weeks of P. glandulosa treatment sufficiently increased force generated by the soleus muscle, as depicted by the significantly elevated twitch- and peak tetanic force production at baseline (PG (AF) vs. PLA (AF)).P glandulosa treatment also resulted in a significantly increased half-relaxation time post-fatigue, compared to the untreated controls (Table 2). Contractile properties of soleus muscle from control vs. P. glandulosa-treated rats before and after fatigue The data are expressed as mean ± SEM; Analysis by two-way ANOVA; n = 10 Force-frequency relationship The force-frequency relationship, which is the sigmoid relationship between a muscle's activation frequency and the consequent isometric force output, displayed a similar trend for both muscles in the treated and untreated groups. This trend is displayed in Figure 6 (B), representing the force generated at each frequency, expressed as a % of the maximum force generated. In contrast, the absolute values of the force generated at different frequencies displays that the soleus muscles of the treated rats generated significantly more force, during electrical stimulation, compared to the untreated rats, at all the different frequencies (P< .001 ). As illustrated in Figure 6 (A), the force generated by the soleus muscle of the untreated rats incrementally increased from 15.34 ± 2.92 N/cm2 at a frequency of 5 Hz to a maximum force of 47.77 ± 5.73 N/cm2 at a frequency of 40 Hz, where after the generated force slowly decreased to a force equal to 38.55 ± 6.27 N/cm2 at a frequency of 100 Hz. A similar trend is followed by the treated rats, but at significantly higher levels. The force generated by the soleus muscle of the P. glandulosa treated rats incrementally increased from 24.37 ± 3.18 N/cm2 at a frequency of 5 Hz to a maximum force of 61 .65 ± 5.05 N/cm2 at a frequency of 40 Hz, before slowly declining to a force of 53.48 ± 6.41 N/cm2 at a frequency of 100 Hz. The level of force generated peaked at a frequency of 40 Hz in both groups. Fatigue characteristics The 2 minute intermitted stimulation (fatigue protocol) was sufficient to significantly decrease the force generated by both the treated and untreated group by at least 50%. In other words, the force measured after the 2 minute fatigue protocol was 50% lower than the force measured before the induction of fatigue (18.03 ± 3.36 vs. 42.62 ± 5.00 N/cm2; P< .0001 ) [Fig. 7 B].P. glandulosa treatment was unable to reduce fatigue tolerance, as fatigue development was not significantly different between the treated versus untreated group at any point during the 2 minute fatigue protocol. However, the initial force generated, was significantly higher in the treated group, when compared to the untreated group (56.39 ± 4.21 vs. 42.62 ± 5.00 N/cm2; P< .001 ). Contractile properties, before and after fatigue The induction of muscle fatigue resulted in the significant reduction in both twitch- and peak tetanic force generated by the soleus muscle, when comparing PLA (BF) to PLA (AF) and PG (BF) to PG (AF).Therefore, as a consequence, the twitch/tetanus ratio was significantly reduced after fatigue compared to before fatigue. Despite fatigue ensuing, the contraction time was unaffected by P. glandulosa treatment, remaining constant throughout. Ten weeks of P. glandulosa treatment sufficiently increased force generated by the soleus muscle, as depicted by the significantly elevated twitch- and peak tetanic force production at baseline (PG (AF) vs. PLA (AF)). P. glandulosa treatment also resulted in a significantly increased half-relaxation time post-fatigue, compared to the untreated controls [Table 2]. Discussion In this study, the Applicant examined the possible strength-increasing effects of P. glandulosa on soleus muscle during electrical field stimulation of healthy rats. The tetanic force generated before fatigue as well as 5 minutes and 20 minutes after fatigue (Fig. 8). From this data it is clear that the force generated 5 minutes after the fatigue protocol was significantly lower than the force generated before fatigue. This is a good indication that the muscles were indeed exhausted, post-fatigue protocol. However, the soleus muscle could regain its force after a 20 minute resting period, as seen in Figure 8. 20 minutes after fatigue, the force generated is similar to the initial force (before fatigue). Another aspect which also changes during exercise-induced fatigue is the slowing of muscle relaxation [Allen et al., 2008]. In the present study, there was no significant difference in the initial phase of half-relaxation time in either the control group or the treated group before and after fatigue (Table 2). However, when rats were treated with P. glandulosa for 16 weeks and electrically stimulated to fatigue (PG (AF)), their soleus muscles relaxed at a significantly slower rate than the soleus muscles of the untreated rats, 5 minutes after fatigue (PLA (AF)) (Table 2). Importantly, the soleus muscles of the treated rats (PG) generated significantly higher force when the muscle was stimulated to generate a single twitch or tetanus (Table 2), prior to the induction of fatigue. This same phenomenon was observed during the force-frequency relationship determination. As depicted in Figure 6(A), the force generated by the soleus muscle of the untreated rats incrementally increased to reach its maximum force at 40 Hz, whereafter the generated force slowly decreased again. Although a similar trend was observed in the treated group, the specific force generated by the soleus muscles of the treated rats was significantly higher at all the different frequencies (Fig. 6(A)). Figure 6(B), representing the % of maximum force generated at each frequency, shows the similar trend in which both treated and untreated soleus muscles generated force after being stimulated at the respective frequencies. A 20 minute resting period allowed the muscle to recover most of its initial force in both the control (PLA) and treated (PG) groups, when compared to the force generated directly after fatigue (5 minutes). It is known that exercise-induced fatigue is reversible and that after a modest resting period the muscle is able to generate the same force as it did before fatigue set in [Allen et al., 2008]. Therefore, one can assume that the augmented effect on force seen in this study will persist if the muscle is left to completely recover. The magnitude of muscle force generation is determined mainly by the size of the muscle and the muscle fiber type [Maughan et al., 1983; Lee et al., 2013]. In this study, no significant difference in the biometrics, i.e. the mass, length and width, of the muscles was found in the different experimental groups, and therefore the muscles seemed phenotypically similar (Table 1 ). A possible explanation for the increase in muscle strength might be that P. glandulosa treatment led to the transition of the muscle fiber type, i.e. from a slow-twitch to a fast-twitch phenotype. It is known that not all muscle fibers are the same and that they differ with regards to numerous factors such as metabolism, contraction duration and the time it takes to develop maximum tension. Skeletal muscle fibers are divided into mainly three categories, oxidative slow-twitch fibers, oxidative fast-twitch fibers and glycolytic fast-twitch fibers. According to the results obtained from this study, it seems as if the transition was from an oxidative slow-twitch to an oxidative fast-twitch phenotype. The oxidative slow-twitch fibers and the oxidative fast- twitch fibers react similarly with regards to fatigue development, i.e. they have both been found to be "fatigue-resistant" [Sllverthorn, 2004]. This similarity with regards to fatigue development can also be seen in the data from this study, as there were no significant differences observed between the treated and untreated groups. These muscles fatigued at the same rate. In addition, the time it takes for oxidative fast-twitch fibers to develop maximum tension are faster than that of the oxidative slow-twitch fibers [Sllverthorn, 2004]. This phenomenon is also evident in these results, as the contraction time of the muscles in the untreated group is relatively slower than that of the treated group (Table 2), i.e. the muscles of the treated animals contracted at a faster rate and therefore reached its maximum tension faster. Motor units containing fast-twitch fibers are typically larger than motor units containing slow-twitch fibers. This difference inevitably means that when a single fast-twitch fiber motor unit is stimulated, more muscle fibers contract than when a slow-twitch fiber motor unit is stimulated. Therefore, since more fibers are stimulated to contract in fast-twitch fiber motor units, more force are produced by fast-twitch fibers. Thus muscle composed of a high proportion of slow-twitch fibers will be relatively weaker than a muscle of similar size with a high proportion of fast-twitch fibers. References 1 .
