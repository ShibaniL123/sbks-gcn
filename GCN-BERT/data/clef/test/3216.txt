BACKGROUND In many chemical processes, caustic soda may be required to achieve a chemical reaction, e.g., to neutralize an acid, or buffer pH of a solution, or precipitate an insoluble hydroxide from a solution. One method by which the caustic soda may be produced is by an electrochemical system. In producing the caustic soda electrochemically, such as via chlor-alkali process, a large amount of energy, salt, and water may be used. Polyvinyl chloride, commonly known as PVC, may be the third-most widely-produced plastic, after polyethylene and polypropylene. PVC is widely used in construction because it is durable, cheap, and easily worked. PVC may be made by polymerization of vinyl chloride monomer which in turn may be made from ethylene dichloride. Ethylene dichloride may be made by direct chlorination of ethylene using chlorine gas made from the chlor-alkali process. The production of chlorine and caustic soda by electrolysis of aqueous solutions of sodium chloride or brine is one of the electrochemical processes demanding high-energy consumption. The total energy requirement is for instance about 2% in the USA and about 1% in Japan of the gross electric power generated, to maintain this process by the chlor-alkali industry. The high energy consumption may be related to high carbon dioxide emission owing to burning of fossil fuels. Therefore, reduction in the electrical power demand needs to be addressed to curtail environment pollution and global warming.

In some embodiments, the metal compound may be used on-site where hydrogen gas is generated and/or in some embodiments, the metal compound withdrawn from the anode chamber may be transferred to a site where hydrogen gas is generated and hydrogen chloride, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen bromide, hydrobromic acid, hydrogen iodide, or hydroiodic acid are formed from it. In some embodiments, the metal compound may be formed in the electrochemical system and used on-site where an unsaturated hydrocarbon such as, but not limited to, ethylene gas is generated or transferred to and/or in some embodiments, the metal compound withdrawn from the anode chamber may be transferred to a site where an unsaturated hydrocarbon such as, but not limited to, ethylene gas is generated or transferred to and halohydrocarbon, e.g., chlorohydrocarbon is formed from it. In some embodiments, the ethylene gas generating facility is integrated with the electrochemical system of the invention to simultaneously produce the metal compound in the higher oxidation state and the ethylene gas and treat them with each other to form a product, such as ethylene dichloride (EDC). The ethylene dichloride may also be known as 1,2-dichloroethane, dichloroethane, 1,2-ethylene dichloride, glycol dichloride, freon 150, borer sol, brocide, destruxol borer-sol, dichlor-mulsion, dutch oil, or granosan. In some embodiments, the electrochemical system of the invention is integrated with vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) production facility or polyvinylchloride (PVC) production facility such that the EDC formed via the systems and methods of the invention is used in VCM and/or PVC production. The electrochemical systems and methods described herein provide one or more advantages over conventional electrochemical systems known in the art, including, but not limited to, no requirement of gas diffusion anode; higher cell efficiency; lower voltages; platinum free anode; sequestration of carbon dioxide; green and environment friendly chemicals; and/or formation of various commercially viable products. The systems and methods of the invention provide an electrochemical cell that produces various products, such as, but not limited to, metal salts formed at the anode, the metal salts used to form various other chemicals, alkali formed at the cathode, alkali used to form various other products, and/or hydrogen gas formed at the cathode. All of such products have been defined herein and may be called “green chemicals” since such chemicals are formed using the electrochemical cell that runs at low voltage or energy and high efficiency. The low voltage or less energy intensive process described herein would lead to lesser emission of carbon dioxide as compared to conventional methods of making similar chemicals or products. In some embodiments, the chemicals or products are formed by the capture of carbon dioxide from flue gas in the alkali generated at the cathode, such as, but not limited to, carbonate and bicarbonate products. Such carbonate and bicarbonate products are “green chemicals” as they reduce the pollution and provide cleaner environment. Metal The “metal ion” or “metal” as used herein, includes any metal ion capable of being converted from lower oxidation state to higher oxidation state. Examples of metal ions include, but not limited to, iron, chromium, copper, tin, silver, cobalt, uranium, lead, mercury, vanadium, bismuth, titanium, ruthenium, osmium, europium, zinc, cadmium, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, rhodium, iridium, manganese, technetium, rhenium, molybdenum, tungsten, niobium, tantalum, zirconium, hafnium, and combination thereof. In some embodiments, the metal ions include, but not limited to, iron, copper, tin, chromium, or combination thereof. In some embodiments, the metal ion is copper. In some embodiments, the metal ion is tin. In some embodiments, the metal ion is iron. In some embodiments, the metal ion is chromium. In some embodiments, the metal ion is platinum. The “oxidation state” as used herein, includes degree of oxidation of an atom in a substance. For example, in some embodiments, the oxidation state is the net charge on the ion. Some examples of the reaction of the metal ions at the anode are as shown in Table I below (SHE is standard hydrogen electrode). The theoretical values of the anode potential are also shown. It is to be understood that some variation from these voltages may occur depending on conditions, pH, concentrations of the electrolytes, etc and such variations are well within the scope of the invention. TABLE I Anode Potential Anode Reaction (V vs. SHE) Ag+ → Ag2+ + e− −1.98 Co2+ → Co3+ + e− −1.82 Pb2+ → Pb4+ + 2e− −1.69 Ce3+ → Ce4+ + e− −1.44 2Cr3+ + 7H2O → Cr2O72− + 14H+ + 6e− −1.33 Tl+ → Tl3+ + 2e− −1.25 Hg22+ → 2Hg2+ + 2e− −0.91 Fe2+ → Fe3+ + e− −0.77 V3+ + H2O → VO2+ + 2H+ + e− −0.34 U4+ + 2H2O → UO2+ + 4H+ + e− −0.27 Bi+ → Bi3+ + 2e− −0.20 Tl3+ + H2O → TlO2+ + 2H+ + e− −0.19 Cu+ → Cu2+ + e− −0.16 UO2+ → UO22+ + e− −0.16 Sn2+ → Sn4+ + 2e− −0.15 Ru(NH3)62+ → Ru(NH3)63+ + e− −0.10 V2+ → V3+ + e− +0.26 Eu2+ → Eu3+ + e− +0.35 Cr2+ → Cr3+ + e− +0.42 U3+ → U4+ + e− +0.52 The metal ion may be present as a compound of the metal or an alloy of the metal or combination thereof. In some embodiments, the anion attached to the metal is same as the anion of the electrolyte. For example, for sodium or potassium chloride used as an electrolyte, a metal chloride, such as, but not limited to, iron chloride, copper chloride, tin chloride, chromium chloride etc. is used as the metal compound. For example, for sodium or potassium sulfate used as an electrolyte, a metal sulfate, such as, but not limited to, iron sulfate, copper sulfate, tin sulfate, chromium sulfate etc. is used as the metal compound. For example, for sodium or potassium bromide used as an electrolyte, a metal bromide, such as, but not limited to, iron bromide, copper bromide, tin bromide etc. is used as the metal compound. In some embodiments, the anion of the electrolyte may be partially or fully different from the anion of the metal. For example, in some embodiments, the anion of the electrolyte may be a sulfate whereas the anion of the metal may be a chloride. In such embodiments, it may be desirable to have less concentration of the chloride ions in the electrochemical cell. For example, in some embodiments, the higher concentration of chloride ions in the anode electrolyte, due to chloride of the electrolyte and the chloride of the metal, may result in undesirable ionic species in the anode electrolyte. This may be avoided by utilizing an electrolyte that contains ions other than chloride. In some embodiments, the anode electrolyte may be a combination of ions similar to the metal anion and anions different from the metal ion. For example, the anode electrolyte may be a mix of sulfate ions as well as chloride ions when the metal anion is chloride. In such embodiments, it may be desirable to have sufficient concentration of chloride ions in the electrolyte to dissolve the metal salt but not high enough to cause undesirable ionic speciation. In some embodiments, the electrolyte and/or the metal compound are chosen based on the desired end product. For example, if HCl is desired from the reaction between the hydrogen gas and the metal compound then metal chloride is used as the metal compound and the sodium chloride is used as an electrolyte. For example, if a brominated hydrocarbon is desired from the reaction between the metal compound and the hydrocarbon, then a metal bromide is used as the metal compound and the sodium or potassium bromide is used as the electrolyte. In some embodiments, the metal ions used in the electrochemical systems described herein, may be chosen based on the solubility of the metal in the anode electrolyte and/or cell voltages desired for the metal oxidation from the lower oxidation state to the higher oxidation state. For example, the voltage required to oxidize Cr2+ to Cr3+ may be lower than that required for Sn2+ to Sn4+, however, the amount of HCl formed by the reaction of the hydrogen gas with the Cr3+ may be lower than the HCl formed with Sn4+ owing to two chlorine atoms obtained per tin molecule. Therefore, in some embodiments, where the lower cell voltages may be desired, the metal ion oxidation that results in lower cell voltage may be used, such as, but not limited to Cr2+. For example, for the reactions where carbon dioxide is captured by the alkali produced by the cathode electrolyte, a lower voltage may be desired. In some embodiments, where a higher amount of the product, such as hydrochloric acid may be desired, the metal ion that results in higher amount of the product albeit relatively higher voltages may be used, such as, but not limited to Sn2+. For example, the voltage of the cell may be higher for tin system as compared to the chromium system, however, the concentration of the acid formed with Sn4+ may offset the higher voltage of the system. It is to be understood, that the products formed by the systems and methods described herein, such as the acid, halohydrocarbons, sulfohydrocarbons, carbonate, bicarbonates, etc. are still “green” chemicals as they are made by less energy intensive processes as compared to energy input required for conventionally known methods of making the same products. In some embodiments, the metal ion in the lower oxidation state and the metal ion in the higher oxidation state are both present in the anode electrolyte. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to have the metal ion in both the lower oxidation state and the higher oxidation state in the anode electrolyte. Suitable ratios of the metal ion in the lower and higher oxidation state in the anode electrolyte have been described herein. The mixed metal ion in the lower oxidation state with the metal ion in the higher oxidation state may assist in lower voltages in the electrochemical systems and high yield and selectivity in corresponding catalytic reactions with hydrogen gas or hydrocarbons. In some embodiments, the metal ion in the anode electrolyte is a mixed metal ion. For example, the anode electrolyte containing the copper ion in the lower oxidation state and the copper ion in the higher oxidation state may also contain another metal ion such as, but not limited to, iron. In some embodiments, the presence of a second metal ion in the anode electrolyte may be beneficial in lowering the total energy of the electrochemical reaction in combination with the catalytic reaction. Some examples of the metal compounds that may be used in the systems and methods of the invention include, but are not limited to, copper (II) sulfate, copper (II) nitrate, copper (I) chloride, copper (I) bromide, copper (I) iodide, iron (III) sulfate, iron (III) nitrate, iron (II) chloride, iron (II) bromide, iron (II) iodide, tin (II) sulfate, tin (II) nitrate, tin (II) chloride, tin (II) bromide, tin (II) iodide, chromium (III) sulfate, chromium (III) nitrate, chromium (II) chloride, chromium (II) bromide, chromium (II) iodide, zinc (II) chloride, zinc (II) bromide, etc. Ligands In some embodiments, an additive such as a ligand is used in conjunction with the metal ion to improve the efficiency of the metal ion oxidation inside the anode chamber and/or improve the catalytic reactions of the metal ion inside/outside the anode chamber such as, but not limited to reactions with hydrogen gas, with unsaturated hydrocarbon, and/or with saturated hydrocarbon.

[in-line-formulae]H2O+1/2O2+2e−→2OH−(cathode)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]ML+→MH++xe−(anode where x=1-3)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]For example, 2Fe2+→2Fe3++2e−(anode)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]2Cr2+2Cr3++2e−(anode)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]Sn2+→Sn4++2e−(anode)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]2Cu+2Cu2++2e−(anode)[/in-line-formulae] The MH+ formed at the anode combines with chloride ions to form metal chloride MCln such as, but not limited to, FeCl3, CrCl3, SnCl4, or CuCl2 etc. The hydroxide ion formed at the cathode reacts with sodium ions to form sodium hydroxide. The oxygen at the cathode may be atmospheric air or any commercial available source of oxygen. The methods and systems containing the gas-diffusion cathode or the ODC, as described herein and illustrated in FIG. 5A, may result in voltage savings as compared to methods and systems that include the hydrogen gas producing cathode (as illustrated in FIG. 4A). The voltage savings in-turn may result in less electricity consumption and less carbon dioxide emission for electricity generation. This may result in the generation of greener chemicals such as sodium hydroxide, halogentated hydrocarbons and/or acids, that are formed by the efficient and energy saving methods and systems of the invention. In some embodiments, the electrochemical cell with ODC has a theoretical voltage savings of more than 0.5V, or more than 1V, or more than 1.5V, or between 0.5-1.5V, as compared to the electrochemical cell with no ODC or as compared to the electrochemical cell with hydrogen gas producing cathode. In some embodiments, this voltage saving is achieved with a cathode electrolyte pH of between 7-15, or between 7-14, or between 6-12, or between 7-12, or between 7-10. The overall cell potential can be determined through the combination of Nernst equations for each half cell reaction: [in-line-formulae]E=Eo−RT ln(Q)/nF [/in-line-formulae] where, Eo is the standard reduction potential, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K), T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of electrons involved in the half cell reaction, F is Faraday's constant (96485 JN mol), and Q is the reaction quotient so that: [in-line-formulae]Etotal=Eanode−Ecathode [/in-line-formulae] When metal in the lower oxidation state is oxidized to metal in the higher oxidation state at the anode as follows: [in-line-formulae]Cu+→Cu2++2e−[/in-line-formulae] Eanode based on varying concentration of copper II species may be between 0.159-0.75V. When water is reduced to hydroxide ions and hydrogen gas at the cathode (as illustrated in FIG. 4A) as follows: [in-line-formulae]2H2O+2e−=H2+2OH−,[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]Ecathode=−0.059 pHc, where pHc is the pH of the cathode electrolyte=14[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]Ecathode=−0.83[/in-line-formulae] Etotal then is between 0.989 to 1.53, depending on the concentration of copper ions in the anode electrolyte. When water is reduced to hydroxide ions at ODC (as illustrated in FIG. 5A) as follows: [in-line-formulae]2H2O+O2+4e−→4OH−[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]Ecathode=1.224-0.059 pHc, where pHc=14[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]Ecathode=0.4V[/in-line-formulae] Etotal then is between −0.241 to 0.3V depending on the concentration of copper ions in the anode electrolyte. Therefore, the use of ODC in the cathode chamber brings the theoretical voltage savings in the cathode chamber or the theoretical voltage savings in the cell of about 1.5V or between 0.5-2V or between 0.5-1.5V or between 1-1.5V, as compared to the electrochemical cell with no ODC or as compared to the electrochemical cell with hydrogen gas producing cathode. Accordingly, in some embodiments, there are provided methods that include contacting an anode with a metal ion in an anode electrolyte; contacting an oxygen depolarizing cathode with a cathode electrolyte; applying a voltage to the anode and the cathode; forming an alkali at the cathode; converting the metal ion from a lower oxidation state to a higher oxidation state at the anode; and saving a voltage of more than 0.5V or between 0.5-1.5V as compared to the hydrogen gas producing cathode or as compared to the cell with no ODC. In some embodiments, there are provided systems that include an anode chamber comprising an anode in contact with a metal ion in an anode electrolyte, wherein the anode is configured to convert the metal ion from a lower oxidation state to a higher oxidation state; and a cathode chamber comprising an oxygen depolarizing cathode in contact with a cathode electrolyte, wherein the cathode is configured to produce an alkali, wherein the system provides a voltage savings of more than 0.5V or between 0.5-1.5V as compared to the system with the hydrogen gas producing cathode or as compared to the system with no ODC. In some embodiments, the voltage savings is a theoretical voltage saving which may change depending on the ohmic resistances in the cell. While the methods and systems containing the gas-diffusion cathode or the ODC result in voltage savings as compared to methods and systems containing the hydrogen gas producing cathode, both the systems i.e. systems containing the ODC and the systems containing hydrogen gas producing cathode of the invention, show significant voltage savings as compared to chlor-alkali system conventionally known in the art. The voltage savings in-turn may result in less electricity consumption and less carbon dioxide emission for electricity generation. This may result in the generation of greener chemicals such as sodium hydroxide, halogentated hydrocarbons and/or acids, that are formed by the efficient and energy saving methods and systems of the invention. For example, the voltage savings is beneficial in production of the halogenated hydrocarbons, such as EDC, which is typically formed by reacting ethylene with chlorine gas generated by the high voltage consuming chlor-alkali process. In some embodiments, the electrochemical system of the invention (2 or 3-compartment cells with hydrogen gas producing cathode or ODC) has a theoretical voltage savings of more than 0.5V, or more than 1V, or more than 1.5V, or between 0.5-3V, as compared to chlor-alkali process. In some embodiments, this voltage saving is achieved with a cathode electrolyte pH of between 7-15, or between 7-14, or between 6-12, or between 7-12, or between 7-10. For example, theoretical Eanode in the chlor-alkali process is about 1.36V undergoing the reaction as follows: [in-line-formulae]2Cl−→Cl2+2e−,[/in-line-formulae] Theoretical Ecathode in the chlor-alkali process is about −0.83V (at pH>14) undergoing the reaction as follows: [in-line-formulae]2H2O+2e−=H2+2OH−[/in-line-formulae] Theoretical Etotal for the chlor-alkali process then is 2.19V. Theoretical Etotal for the hydrogen gas producing cathode in the system of the invention is between 0.989 to 1.53V and Etotal for ODC in the system of the invention then is between −0.241 to 0.3V, depending on the concentration of copper ions in the anode electrolyte. Therefore, the electrochemical systems of the invention bring the theoretical voltage savings in the cathode chamber or the theoretical voltage savings in the cell of greater than 3V or greater than 2V or between 0.5-2.5V or between 0.5-2.0V or between 0.5-1.5V or between 0.5-1.0V or between 1-1.5V or between 1-2V or between 1-2.5V or between 1.5-2.5V, as compared to the chlor-alkali system. In some embodiments, the electrochemical cell may be conditioned with a first electrolyte and may be operated with a second electrolyte. For example, in some embodiments, the electrochemical cell and the AEM, CEM or combination thereof are conditioned with sodium sulfate as the electrolyte and after the stabilization of the voltage with sodium sulfate, the cell may be operated with sodium chloride as the electrolyte.

In some embodiments, the electrochemical system 500 includes a gas diffusion cathode in contact with a cathode electrolyte 501 and an anode in contact with an anode electrolyte 502. Following are the reactions that may take place at the anode and the cathode. [in-line-formulae]2H++1/2O2+2e−→H2O(cathode)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]ML+MH++xe−(anode where x=1-3)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]For example, 2Fe2+2Fe3++2e−(anode)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]2Cr2+→2Cr3++2e−(anode)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]Sn2+→Sn4++2e−(anode)[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]2Cu+→2Cu2++2e−(anode)[/in-line-formulae] The MH+ formed at the anode combines with chloride ions to form metal chloride MCln such as, but not limited to, FeCl3, CrCl3, SnCl4, or CuCl2 etc. The oxygen at the cathode may be atmospheric air or any commercial available source of oxygen.

No. 8,357,270 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other sources of HCl are well known in the art. An example of HCl source from VCM production process and its integration into the electrochemical system of the invention, is illustrated in FIG. 8B below. In some embodiments of the methods and systems described herein, a size exclusion membrane (SEM) is used in conjunction with or in place of anion exchange membrane (AEM). In some embodiments, the AEM is surface coated with a layer of SEM. In some embodiments, the SEM is bonded or pressed against the AEM. The use of SEM with or in place of AEM can prevent migration of the metal ion or ligand attached metal ion from the anolyte to the catholyte owing to the large size of the metal ion alone or attached to the ligand. This can further prevent fouling of CEM or contamination of the catholyte with the metal ion. It is to be understood that this use of SEM in combination with or in place of AEM will still facilitate migration of chloride ions from the third electrolyte into the anolyte. In some embodiments, there are provided methods that include contacting an anode with an anode electrolyte; oxidizing a metal ion from the lower oxidation state to a higher oxidation state at the anode; contacting a cathode with a cathode electrolyte; and preventing migration of the metal ions from the anode electrolyte to the cathode electrolyte by using a size exclusion membrane.

In some embodiments, the unsaturated hydrocarbon in such systems is ethylene. In some embodiments, the metal ion in such systems is copper chloride. In some embodiments, the unsaturated hydrocarbon in such systems is ethylene and the metal ion is copper chloride. An example of halogenated hydrocarbon that can be formed from ethylene is EDC. In some embodiments, the size exclusion membrane as defined herein above and herein, fully prevents the migration of the metal ion to the cathode chamber or the middle chamber with the third electrolyte or reduces the migration by 100%; or by 99%; or by 95% or by 75%; or by 50%; or by 25%; or between 25-50%; or between 50-75%; or between 50-95%. In some embodiments, the AEM used in the methods and systems of the invention, is resistant to the organic compounds (such as ligands or hydrocarbons) such that AEM does not interact with the organics and/or the AEM does not react or absorb metal ions. This can be achieved, for example only, by using a polymer that does not contain a free radical or anion available for reaction with organics or with metal ions. For example only, a fully quarternized amine containing polymer may be used as an AEM. Other examples of AEM have been described herein. In some embodiments, the metal formed with a higher oxidation state in the anode electrolyte is subjected to reactions that may result in corresponding oxidized products (halogenated hydrocarbon and/or acid) as well as the metal in the reduced lower oxidation state. The metal ion in the lower oxidation state may then be re-circulated back to the electrochemical system for the generation of the metal ion in the higher oxidation state. Such reactions to re-generate the metal ion in the lower oxidation state from the metal ion in the higher oxidation state, include, but are not limited to, reactions with hydrogen gas or hydrocarbons as described herein.

As illustrated in FIG. 7C, the separation process may include a preferential adsorption/absorption of a mineral acid to an anion exchange resin. In the first step, the anolyte containing HCl and/or H2SO4 is passed through the ion exchange resin which adsorbs HCl and/or H2SO4 and then separates out the anolyte. The HCl and/or H2SO4 can be regenerated back from the resin by washing the resin with water. Diffusion dialysis can be another method for separating acid from the anolyte. In some embodiments, the ligands described herein, may facilitate the separation of the metal ion from the acid solution due to the large size of the ligand attached to the metal ion.

The products, such as, but not limited to, halogenated hydrocarbon, acid, carbonate, and/or bicarbonate formed by the methods and systems of the invention are greener than the same products formed by the methods and systems conventionally known in the art. There are provided methods to make green halogenated hydrocarbon, that include contacting an anode with an anode electrolyte; oxidizing a metal-chloride from the lower oxidation state to a higher oxidation state at the anode; contacting a cathode with a cathode electrolyte; and halogenating an unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon with the metal chloride in the higher oxidation state to produce a green halogenated hydrocarbon. In some embodiments, there is provided a green halogenated hydrocarbon formed by the methods described herein. There are also provided system that include an anode in contact with an anode electrolyte wherein the anode is configured to oxidize a metal ion from the lower oxidation state to a higher oxidation state; a cathode in contact with a cathode electrolyte; and a reactor operably connected to the anode chamber and configured to react the metal ion in the higher oxidation state with an unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon to form a green halogenated hydrocarbon. The term “greener” or “green” or grammatical equivalent thereof, as used herein, includes any chemical or product formed by the methods and systems of the invention that has higher energy savings or voltage savings as compared to the same chemical or product formed by the methods known in the art. For example, chlor-alkali is a process that typically is used to make chlorine gas, which chlorine gas is then used to chlorinate ethylene to form EDC. The amount of energy required to make EDC from the chlor-alkali process is higher than the amount of energy required to make EDC from the metal oxidation process of the invention. Therefore, the EDC produced by the methods and systems of the invention is greener than the EDC produced by the chlor-alkali process. Such savings in energy is illustrated in FIG. 8C which illustrates the activation barriers for carrying out the methods of the invention compared to the activation barriers for the chlor-alkali process. As illustrated in FIG. 8C, a comparison is made between the energy required to make EDC from the chlor-alkali process and the energy required to make the EDC from the methods and systems of the invention. The process of making EDC is illustrated in two parts. An electrochemistry part, where the copper oxidation takes place in System 1 and System 2 of the invention compared to chlorine generation taking place in the chlor-alkali process. A catalysis part, where copper (II) chloride (generated by electrochemistry) chlorinates ethylene in System 1 and 2 and chlorine gas (generated by the chlor-alkali process) chlorinates ethylene (conventionally known) to form EDC. In System 1, the electrochemical reaction is carried out in the absence of ligand and in System 2, the electrochemical reaction is carried out in the presence of the ligand. In System 1, System 2, and the chlor-alkali process, the cathode is a hydrogen gas producing cathode and the current density for the electrochemical reaction is 300 mA/cm2. As illustrated in FIG. 8C, for the electrochemical reaction, there is an energy saving of more than 125 kJ/mol for System 1 over chlor-alkali process and energy savings of more than 225 kJ/mol for System 2 over the chlor-alkali process. Therefore, there can be an energy savings of up to 300 kJ/mol; or up to 250 kJ/mol; or between 50-300 kJ/mol; or between 50-250 kJ/mol; or between 100-250 kJ/mol; or between 100-200 kJ/mol, to make the green halogenated hydrocarbon, such as, but not limited to, EDC, by methods and systems of the invention as compared to conventional process such as chlor-alkali process to make EDC. This converts to a saving of more than 1 megawatthour/ton of EDC or between 1-21 megawatthour/ton of EDC for Systems 1 and 2 compared to the chlor-alkali process. It also correlates to the voltage saving of more than 1V or between 1-2V (1V×2 electrons is approx. 200 kJ/mol) as compared to the chlor-alkali process. As also illustrated in FIG. 8C, the catalyst part of the reaction has a theoretical low barrier for each System 1 and 2 and a high barrier for the two Systems 1 and 2. The catalyst reaction in System 1 and System 2 can happen at the point of low barrier or at the point of high barrier or anywhere in between, depending on conditions, such as, but not limited to, concentration, size of the reactor, flow rates etc. Even if there is some energy input for the catalysis reaction in System 1 and 2, it will be offset by the significant energy saving in the electrochemical reaction such that there is a net energy saving of up to 100 kJ/mol; or more than 100 kJ/mol; or between 50-100 kJ/mol; or between 0-100 kJ/mol. This converts to up to or more than 1 megawatthr/ton of EDC or voltage saving of 0-1V or more than 1V; or between 1-2V as compared to chlor-alkali process. It is to be understood that the chlor-alkali process, System 1 and System 2 are all carried out in the aqueous medium. The electrochemical cell or the catalysis system running on an organic solvent (e.g., with some or all of the water from electrochemical cell removed by azeotropic distillation) would require even higher energy than the conventional method and would not be yielding a green halogenated hydrocarbon. Also further illustrated in FIG. 8C, is the savings in energy in System 2 which is with the use of the ligand as compared to System 1 which is without the use of the ligand. Accordingly, there are provided methods to make green halogenated hydrocarbon, that include contacting an anode with an anode electrolyte; oxidizing a metal chloride from the lower oxidation state to a higher oxidation state at the anode; contacting a cathode with a cathode electrolyte; and halogenating an unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon with the metal chloride in the higher oxidation state to produce a green halogenated hydrocarbon wherein the method results in net energy saving of more than 100 kJ/mol or more than 150 kJ/mol or more than 200 kJ/mol or between 100-250 kJ/mol or between 50-100 kJ/mol or between 0-100 kJ/mol or the method results in the voltage savings of more than 1V or between 0-1V or between 1-2V or between 0-2V. There are also provided system that include an anode in contact with an anode electrolyte wherein the anode is configured to oxidize a metal ion from the lower oxidation state to a higher oxidation state; a cathode in contact with a cathode electrolyte; and a reactor operably connected to the anode chamber and configured to react the metal ion in the higher oxidation state with an unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon to form a green halogenated hydrocarbon wherein the system results in net energy saving of more than 100 kJ/mol or more than 150 kJ/mol or more than 200 kJ/mol or between 100-250 kJ/mol or between 50-100 kJ/mol or between 0-100 kJ/mol or the system results in the voltage savings of more than 1V or between 0-1V or between 1-2V or between 0-2V. All the electrochemical systems and methods described herein are carried out in more than 5 wt % water or more than 6 wt % water or aqueous medium. In one aspect, the methods and systems provide an advantage of conducting the metal oxidation reaction in the electrochemical cell and reduction reaction outside the cell, all in an aqueous medium. Applicants surprisingly and unexpectedly found that the use of aqueous medium, in the halogenations or sulfonation of the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon or hydrogen gas, not only resulted in high yield and selectivity of the product (shown in examples herein) but also resulted in the generation of the reduced metal ion with lower oxidation state in the aqueous medium which could be re-circulated back to the electrochemical system. In some embodiments, since the electrochemical cell runs efficiently in the aqueous medium, no removal or minimal removal of water (such as through azeotropic distillation) is required from the anode electrolyte containing the metal ion in the higher oxidation state which is reacted with the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon or hydrogen gas in the aqueous medium. Therefore, the use of the aqueous medium in both the electrochemical cell and the catalysis system provides efficient and less energy intensive integrated systems and methods of the invention.

In some embodiments of the methods and systems described herein, the anode electrolyte may contain an acid. The acid may be added to the anode electrolyte to bring the pH of the anolyte to 1 or 2 or less. The acid may be hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid. The systems provided herein include a reactor operably connected to the anode chamber. The reactor is configured to contact the metal chloride in the anode electrolyte with the hydrogen gas or the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon. The reactor may be any means for contacting the metal chloride in the anode electrolyte with the hydrogen gas or the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon. Such means or such reactor are well known in the art and include, but not limited to, pipe, duct, tank, series of tanks, container, tower, conduit, and the like. Some examples of such reactors are described in FIGS. 7A, 7B, 10A, and 10B herein. The reactor may be equipped with one or more of controllers to control temperature sensor, pressure sensor, control mechanisms, inert gas injector, etc. to monitor, control, and/or facilitate the reaction. In some embodiments, the reaction between the metal chloride with metal ion in higher oxidation state and the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon, are carried out in the reactor at the temperature of between 100-200° C. or between 100-175° C. or between 150-175° C. and pressure of between 100-500 psig or between 100-400 psig or between 100-300 psig or between 150-350 psig. In some embodiments, the components of the reactor are lined with Teflon to prevent corrosion of the components. Some examples of the reactors for carrying out the reaction of the metal ion in the higher oxidation state with the hydrogen gas are illustrated in FIGS. 7A and 7B. In some embodiments, the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon may be administered to the anode chamber where the metal halide or metal sulfate with metal in the higher oxidation state reacts with the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon to form respective products inside the anode chamber. In some embodiments, the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon may be administered to the anode chamber where the metal chloride with metal in the higher oxidation state reacts with the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon to form chlorohydrocarbon. Such systems include the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon delivery system which is operably connected to the anode chamber and is configured to deliver the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon to the anode chamber. The unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon may be a solid, liquid, or a gas. The unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon may be supplied to the anode using any means for directing the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon from the external source to the anode chamber. Such means for directing the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon from the external source to the anode chamber or the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon delivery system are well known in the art and include, but not limited to, pipe, tanks, duct, conduit, and the like. In some embodiments, the system or the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon delivery system includes a duct that directs the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon from the external source to the anode. It is to be understood that the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon may be directed to the anode from the bottom of the cell, top of the cell or sideways. In some embodiments, the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon gas is directed to the anode in such a way that the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon gas is not in direct contact with the anolyte. In some embodiments, the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon may be directed to the anode through multiple entry ports. The source of unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon that provides unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon to the anode chamber, in the methods and systems provided herein, includes any source of unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon known in the art. Such sources include, without limitation, commercial grade unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon and/or unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon generating plants, such as, petrochemical refinery industry. In some embodiments, there are provided methods and systems where the electrochemical cells of the invention are set up on-site where unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon is generated, such as refinery for carrying out the halogenations, such as chlorination of the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon. In some embodiments, the metal ion containing anolyte from the electrochemical system is transported to the refinery where the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon is formed for carrying out the halogenations, such as chlorination of the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon. In some embodiments, the methods and systems of the invention can utilize the ethylene gas from the refineries without the need for the filtration or cleaning of the ethylene gas. Typically, the ethylene gas generating plants scrub the gas to get rid of the impurities. In some embodiments of the methods and systems of the invention, such pre-scrubbing of the gas is not needed and can be avoided. In some embodiments, the metal generation and the halogenations, such as chlorination reaction takes place in the same anode chamber. An illustrative example of such embodiment is depicted in FIG. 9. It is to be understood that the system 900 of FIG. 9 is for illustration purposes only and other metal ions with different oxidations states, other unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbons, other electrochemical systems forming products other than alkali, such as water or hydrogen gas in the cathode chamber, and other unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon gases, are equally applicable to the system. In some embodiments, as illustrated in FIG. 9, the electrochemical system 900 includes an anode situated near the AEM. The system 900 also includes a gas diffusion layer (GDL). The anode electrolyte is in contact with the anode on one side and the GDL on the other side. In some embodiments, the anode may be situated to minimize the resistance from the anolyte, for example, the anode may be situated close to AEM or bound to AEM. In some embodiments, the anode converts metal ions from the lower oxidation state to the metal ions in the higher oxidation states. For example, the anode converts metal ions from 1+ oxidation state to 2+ oxidation state. The Cu2+ ions combine with chloride ions to form CuCl2. The ethylene gas is pressurized into a gaseous chamber on one side of the GDL. The ethylene gas then diffuses through the gas diffusion layer and reacts with metal chloride in the higher oxidation state to form chlorohydrocarbon, such as ethylene dichloride. The metal chloride CuCl2 in turn undergoes reduction to lower oxidation state to form CuCl. In some embodiments, the anode electrolyte may be withdrawn and the ethylene dichloride may be separated from the anode electrolyte using separation techniques well known in the art, including, but not limited to, filtration, vacuum distillation, fractional distillation, fractional crystallization, ion exchange resin, etc. In some embodiments, the ethylene dichloride may be denser than the anode electrolyte and may form a separate layer inside the anode chamber. In such embodiments, the ethylene dichloride may be removed from the bottom of the cell. In some embodiments, the gaseous chamber on one side of GDL may be vented to remove the gas. In some embodiments, the anode chamber may be vented to remove the gaseous ethylene or gaseous byproducts. The system 900 also includes an oxygen depolarized cathode that produces hydroxide ions from water and oxygen. The hydroxide ions may be subjected to any of the carbonate precipitation processes described herein. In some embodiments, the cathode is not a gas-diffusion cathode but is a cathode as described in FIG. 4A or 4B. In some embodiments, the system 900 may be applied to any electrochemical system that produces alkali. In some embodiments of the system and method described herein, no gas is formed at the cathode. In some embodiments of the system and method described herein, hydrogen gas is formed at the cathode. In some embodiments of the system and method described herein, no gas is formed at the anode. In some embodiments of the system and method described herein, no gas is used at the anode other than the gaseous unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon. Another illustrative example of the reactor that is connected to the electrochemical system is illustrated in FIG. 10A. As illustrated in FIG. 10A, the anode chamber of the electrochemical system (electrochemical system can be any electrochemical system described herein) is connected to a reactor which is also connected to a source of unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon, an example illustrated as ethylene (C2H4) in FIG. 10A. In some embodiments, the electrochemical system and the reactor are inside the same unit and are connected inside the unit. The anode electrolyte, containing the metal ion in the higher oxidation state optionally with the metal ion in the lower oxidation state, along with ethylene are fed to a prestressed (e.g., brick-lined) reactor. The chlorination of ethylene takes place inside the reactor to form ethylene dichloride (EDC or dichloroethane DCE) and the metal ion in the lower oxidation state. The reactor may operate in the range of 340-360° F. and 200-300 psig. Other reactor conditions, such as, but not limited to, metal ion concentration, ratio of metal ion in the lower oxidation state to the metal ion in the higher oxidation state, partial pressures of DCE and water vapor can be set to assure high selectivity operation. Reaction heat may be removed by vaporizing water. In some embodiments, a cooling surface may not be required in the reactor and thus no temperature gradients or close temperature control may be needed. The reactor effluent gases may be quenched with water (shown as “quench” reactor in FIG. 10A) in the prestressed (e.g., brick-lined) packed tower. The liquid leaving the tower may be cooled further and separated into the aqueous phase and DCE phase. The aqueous phase may be split part being recycled to the tower as quench water and the remainder may be recycled to the reactor or the electrochemical system. The DCE product may be cooled further and flashed to separate out more water and dissolved ethylene. This dissolved ethylene may be recycled as shown in FIG. 10A. The uncondensed gases from the quench tower may be recycled to the reactor, except for the purge stream to remove inerts. The purge stream may go through the ethylene recovery system to keep the over-all utilization of ethylene high, e.g., as high as 95%. Experimental determinations may be made of flammability limits for ethylene gas at actual process temperature, pressure and compositions. The construction material of the plant may include prestressed brick linings, Hastealloys B and C, inconel, dopant grade titanium (e.g. AKOT, Grade II), tantalum, Kynar, Teflon, PEEK, glass, or other polymers or plastics. The reactor may also be designed to continuously flow the anode electrolyte in and out of the reactor. Another illustrative example of the reactor that is connected to the electrochemical system is as illustrated in FIG. 10B. As illustrated in FIG. 10B, the reactor system 1000 is a glass vessel A, suspended from the top portion of a metal flange B, connected to an exit line C, by means of a metal ball socket welded to the head of the flange. The glass reactor is encased in an electrically heated metal shell, D. The heat input and the temperature may be controlled by an automatic temperature regulator. The hydrocarbon may be introduced into the metal shell through an opening E and through the glass tube F, which may be fitted with a fritted glass foot. This arrangement may provide for pressure equalization on both sides of the glass reactor. The hydrocarbon may come into contact with the metal solution (metal in higher oxidation state) at the bottom of the reactor and may bubble through the medium. The volatile products, water vapor, and/or unreacted hydrocarbon may leave via line C, equipped optionally with valve H which may reduce the pressure to atmosphere. The exiting gases may be passed through an appropriate trapping system to remove the product. The apparatus may also be fitted with a bypass arrangement G, which permits the passage of the gas through the pressure zone without passing through the aqueous metal medium. In some embodiments, the reduced metal ions in lower oxidation state that are left in the vessel, are subjected to electrolysis, as described herein, to regenerate the metal ions in the higher oxidation state. An illustrative embodiment of the invention is as shown in FIG. 11. As illustrated in FIG. 11, the electrochemical system 600 of FIG. 6 (or alternatively system 400 of FIG. 4A) may be integrated with CuCl—HCl electrochemical system 1100 (also illustrated as system in FIG. 4B). In the CuCl—HCl electrochemical system 1100, the input at the anode is CuCl and HCl which results in CuCl2 and hydrogen ions. The hydrogen ions pass through a proton exchange membrane to the cathode where it forms hydrogen gas. In some embodiments, chloride conducting membranes may also be used. In some embodiments, it is contemplated that the CuCl—HCl cell may run at 0.5V or less and the system 600 may run at 0V or less. Some deviations from the contemplated voltage may occur due to resistance losses. In one aspect, in the systems and methods provided herein, the CuCl2 formed in the anode electrolyte may be used for copper production. For example, the CuCl2 formed in the systems and methods of the invention may be used for leaching process to extract copper from the copper minerals. For example only, chalcopyrite is a copper mineral which can be leached in chloride milieu with the help of an oxidizer, Cu2+. Divalent copper may leach the copper of chalcopyrite and other sulfides. Other minerals such as iron, sulfur, gold, silver etc. can be recovered once copper is leached out. In some embodiments, CuCl2 produced by the electrochemical cells described herein, may be added to the copper mineral concentrate. The Cu2+ ions may oxidize the copper mineral and form CuCl. The CuCl solution from the concentrate may be fed back to the anode chamber of the electrochemical cell described herein which may convert CuCl to CuCl2. The CuCl2 may be then fed back to the mineral concentrate to further oxidize the copper mineral. Once the copper is leached out, the silver may be cemented out along with further precipitation of zinc, lead etc. The copper may be then precipitated out as copper oxide by treatment with alkali which alkali may be produced by the cathode chamber of the electrochemical cell. After the precipitation of copper as oxide, the filtrate NaCl may be returned to the electrochemical cell. The hydrogen gas generated at the cathode may be used for the reduction of the copper oxide to form metallic copper (at high temp.). The molten copper may be cast into copper products like copper wire rod. This method can be used for low grade ores or for various types of copper minerals. The electrochemical plant may be fitted close to the quarry or close to the concentrator eliminating transportation cost for waste products and allowing transportation of valuable metal products only. The processes and systems described herein may be batch processes or systems or continuous flow processes or systems. The reaction of the hydrogen gas or the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon with the metal ion in the higher oxidation state, as described in the aspects and embodiments herein, is carried out in the aqueous medium. In some embodiments, such reaction may be in a non-aqueous liquid medium which may be a solvent for the hydrocarbon or hydrogen gas feedstock. The liquid medium or solvent may be aqueous or non-aqueous. Suitable non-aqueous solvents being polar and non-polar aprotic solvents, for example dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), halogenated hydrocarbons, for example only, dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, and 1,2-dichloroethane, and organic nitriles, for example, acetonitrile. Organic solvents may contain a nitrogen atom capable of forming a chemical bond with the metal in the lower oxidation state thereby imparting enhanced stability to the metal ion in the lower oxidation state. In some embodiments, acetonitrile is the organic solvent. In some embodiments, when the organic solvent is used for the reaction between the metal ion in the higher oxidation state with the hydrogen gas or hydrocarbon, the water may need to be removed from the metal containing medium. As such, the metal ion obtained from the electrochemical systems described herein may contain water. In some embodiments, the water may be removed from the metal ion containing medium by azeotropic distillation of the mixture. In some embodiments, the solvent containing the metal ion in the higher oxidation state and the hydrogen gas or the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon may contain between 5-90%; or 5-80%; or 5-70%; or 5-60%; or 5-50%; or 5-40%; or 5-30%; or 5-20%; or 5-10% by weight of water in the reaction medium. The amount of water which may be tolerated in the reaction medium may depend upon the particular halide carrier in the medium, the tolerable amount of water being greater, for example, for copper chloride than for ferric chloride. Such azeotropic distillation may be avoided when the aqueous medium is used in the reactions. In some embodiments, the reaction of the metal ion in the higher oxidation state with the hydrogen gas or the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon may take place when the reaction temperature is above 50° C. up to 350° C. In aqueous media, the reaction may be carried out under a super atmospheric pressure of up to 1000 psi or less to maintain the reaction medium in liquid phase at a temperature of from 50° C. to 200° C., typically from about 120° C. to about 180° C. In some embodiments, the reaction of the metal ion in the higher oxidation state with the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon may include a halide carrier. In some embodiments, the ratio of halide ion:total metal ion in the higher oxidation state is 1:1; or greater than 1:1; or 1.5:1; or greater than 2:1 and or at least 3:1. Thus, for example, the ratio in cupric halide solutions in concentrated hydrochloric acid may be about 2:1 or 3:1. In some embodiments, owing to the high rate of usage of the halide carrier it may be desired to use the metal halides in high concentration and to employ saturated or near-saturated solutions of the metal halides. If desired, the solutions may be buffered to maintain the pH at the desired level during the halogenation reaction. In some embodiments, a non-halide salt of the metal may be added to the solution containing metal ion in the higher oxidation state. The added metal salt may be soluble in the metal halide solution. Examples of suitable salts for incorporating in cupric chloride solutions include, but are not limited to, copper sulphate, copper nitrate and copper tetrafluoroborate. In some embodiments a metal halide may be added that is different from the metal halide employed in the methods and systems. For example, ferric chloride may be added to the cupric chloride systems at the time of halogenations of the unsaturated hydrocarbon. The unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon feedstock may be fed to the halogenation vessel continuously or intermittently. Efficient halogenation may be dependent upon achieving intimate contact between the feedstock and the metal ion in solution and the halogenation reaction may be carried out by a technique designed to improve or maximize such contact. The metal ion solution may be agitated by stirring or shaking or any desired technique, e.g. the reaction may be carried out in a column, such as a packed column, or a trickle-bed reactor or reactors described herein. For example, where the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon is gaseous, a counter-current technique may be employed wherein the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon is passed upwardly through a column or reactor and the metal ion solution is passed downwardly through the column or reactor. In addition to enhancing contact of the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon and the metal ion in the solution, the techniques described herein may also enhance the rate of dissolution of the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon in the solution, as may be desirable in the case where the solution is aqueous and the water-solubility of the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon is low. Dissolution of the feedstock may also be assisted by higher pressures. Mixtures of saturated, unsaturated hydrocarbons and/or partially halogenated hydrocarbons may be employed. In some embodiments, partially-halogenated products of the process of the invention which are capable of further halogenation may be recirculated to the reaction vessel through a product-recovery stage and, if appropriate, a metal ion in the lower oxidation state regeneration stage. In some embodiments, the halogenation reaction may continue outside the halogenation reaction vessel, for example in a separate regeneration vessel, and care may need to be exercised in controlling the reaction to avoid over-halogenation of the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon. In some embodiments, the electrochemical systems described herein are set up close to the plant that produces the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon or that produces hydrogen gas. In some embodiments, the electrochemical systems described herein are set up close to the PVC plant. For example, in some embodiments, the electrochemical system is within the radius of 100 miles near the ethylene gas, hydrogen gas, vinyl chloride monomer, and/or PVC plant.

Accordingly, in some embodiments, the electrochemical systems described herein are set up close to the plants as described above, close to the source of divalent cations and/or the source of carbon dioxide such as, refineries producing the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon, such that the alkali generated in the cathode electrolyte is able to sequester carbon dioxide to form carbonate/bicarbonate products. Any number of halo or sulfohydrocarbons may be generated from the reaction of the metal chloride in the higher oxidation state with the unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbons, as described herein.

Such means are well known in the art and include, without limitation, devices, such as, electrical power source, fuel cell, device powered by sun light, device powered by wind, and combination thereof. The type of electrical power source to provide the current can be any power source known to one skilled in the art. For example, in some embodiments, the voltage may be applied by connecting the anodes and the cathodes of the cell to an external direct current (DC) power source. The power source can be an alternating current (AC) rectified into DC. The DC power source may have an adjustable voltage and current to apply a requisite amount of the voltage to the electrochemical cell. In some embodiments, the current applied to the electrochemical cell is at least 50 mA/cm2; or at least 100 mA/cm2; or at least 150 mA/cm2; or at least 200 mA/cm2; or at least 500 mA/cm2; or at least 1000 mA/cm2; or at least 1500 mA/cm2; or at least 2000 mA/cm2; or at least 2500 mA/cm2; or between 100-2500 mA/cm2; or between 100-2000 mA/cm2; or between 100-1500 mA/cm2; or between 100-1000 mA/cm2; or between 100-500 mA/cm2; or between 200-2500 mA/cm2; or between 200-2000 mA/cm2; or between 200-1500 mA/cm2; or between 200-1000 mA/cm2; or between 200-500 mA/cm2; or between 500-2500 mA/cm2; or between 500-2000 mA/cm2; or between 500-1500 mA/cm2; or between 500-1000 mA/cm2; or between 1000-2500 mA/cm2; or between 1000-2000 mA/cm2; or between 1000-1500 mA/cm2; or between 1500-2500 mA/cm2; or between 1500-2000 mA/cm2; or between 2000-2500 mA/cm2. In some embodiments, the cell runs at voltage of between 0-3V when the applied current is 100-250 mA/cm2 or 100-150 mA/cm2 or 100-200 mA/cm2 or 100-300 mA/cm2 or 100-400 mA/cm2 or 100-500 mA/cm2 or 150-200 mA/cm2 or 200-150 mA/cm2 or 200-300 mA/cm2 or 200-400 mA/cm2 or 200-500 mA/cm2 or 150 mA/cm2 or 200 mA/cm2 or 300 mA/cm2 or 400 mA/cm2 or 500 mA/cm2 or 600 mA/cm2. In some embodiments, the cell runs at between 0-1V. In some embodiments, the cell runs at between 0-1.5V when the applied current is 100-250 mA/cm2 or 100-150 mA/cm2 or 150-200 mA/cm2 or 150 mA/cm2 or 200 mA/cm2. In some embodiments, the cell runs at between 0-1V at an amperic load of 100-250 mA/cm2 or 100-150 mA/cm2 or 150-200 mA/cm2 or 150 mA/cm2 or 200 mA/cm2. In some embodiments, the cell runs at 0.5V at a current or an amperic load of 100-250 mA/cm2 or 100-150 mA/cm2 or 150-200 mA/cm2 or 150 mA/cm2 or 200 mA/cm2. In some embodiments, the systems and methods provided herein further include a percolator and/or a spacer between the anode and the ion exchange membrane and/or the cathode and the ion exchange membrane. The electrochemical systems containing percolator and/or spacers are described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/442,573, filed Feb. 14, 2011, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety in the present disclosure. The systems provided herein are applicable to or can be used for any of one or more methods described herein. In some embodiments, the systems provided herein further include an oxygen gas supply or delivery system operably connected to the cathode chamber. The oxygen gas delivery system is configured to provide oxygen gas to the gas-diffusion cathode. In some embodiments, the oxygen gas delivery system is configured to deliver gas to the gas-diffusion cathode where reduction of the gas is catalyzed to hydroxide ions. In some embodiments, the oxygen gas and water are reduced to hydroxide ions; un-reacted oxygen gas in the system is recovered; and re-circulated to the cathode. The oxygen gas may be supplied to the cathode using any means for directing the oxygen gas from the external source to the cathode. Such means for directing the oxygen gas from the external source to the cathode or the oxygen gas delivery system are well known in the art and include, but not limited to, pipe, duct, conduit, and the like. In some embodiments, the system or the oxygen gas delivery system includes a duct that directs the oxygen gas from the external source to the cathode. It is to be understood that the oxygen gas may be directed to the cathode from the bottom of the cell, top of the cell or sideways. In some embodiments, the oxygen gas is directed to the back side of the cathode where the oxygen gas is not in direct contact with the catholyte. In some embodiments, the oxygen gas may be directed to the cathode through multiple entry ports. The source of oxygen that provides oxygen gas to the gas-diffusion cathode, in the methods and systems provided herein, includes any source of oxygen known in the art. Such sources include, without limitation, ambient air, commercial grade oxygen gas from cylinders, oxygen gas obtained by fractional distillation of liquefied air, oxygen gas obtained by passing air through a bed of zeolites, oxygen gas obtained from electrolysis of water, oxygen obtained by forcing air through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxides by either high pressure or electric current, chemical oxygen generators, oxygen gas as a liquid in insulated tankers, or combination thereof. In some embodiments, the source of oxygen may also provide carbon dioxide gas. In some embodiments, the oxygen from the source of oxygen gas may be purified before being administered to the cathode chamber. In some embodiments, the oxygen from the source of oxygen gas is used as is in the cathode chamber. Alkali in the Cathode Chamber The cathode electrolyte containing the alkali may be withdrawn from the cathode chamber. The alkali may be separated from the cathode electrolyte using techniques known in the art, including but not limited to, diffusion dialysis. In some embodiments, the alkali produced in the methods and systems provided herein, is used as is commercially or is used in commercial processes known in the art. The purity of the alkali formed in the methods and systems may vary depending on the end use requirements. For example, methods and systems provided herein that use an electrochemical cell equipped with membranes, may form a membrane quality alkali which may be substantially free of impurities. In some embodiments, a less pure alkali may also be formed by avoiding the use of membranes or by adding the carbon to the cathode electrolyte. In some embodiments, the alkali formed in the cathode electrolyte is more than 2% w/w or more than 5% w/w or between 5-50% w/w. In some embodiments, the alkali produced in the cathode chamber may be used in various commercial processes, as described herein. In some embodiments, the system appropriate to such uses may be operatively connected to the electrochemical unit, or the alkali may be transported to the appropriate site for use. In some embodiments, the systems include a collector configured to collect the alkali from the cathode chamber and connect it to the appropriate process which may be any means to collect and process the alkali including, but not limited to, tanks, collectors, pipes etc. that can collect, process, and/or transfer the alkali produced in the cathode chamber for use in the various commercial processes. In some embodiments, the alkali, such as, sodium hydroxide produced in the cathode electrolyte is used as is for commercial purposes or is treated in variety of ways well known in the art. For example, sodium hydroxide formed in the catholyte may be used as a base in the chemical industry, in household, and/or in the manufacture of pulp, paper, textiles, drinking water, soaps, detergents and drain cleaner. In some embodiments, the sodium hydroxide may be used in making paper. Along with sodium sulfide, sodium hydroxide may be a component of the white liquor solution used to separate lignin from cellulose fibers in the Kraft process. It may also be useful in several later stages of the process of bleaching the brown pulp resulting from the pulping process. These stages may include oxygen delignification, oxidative extraction, and simple extraction, all of which may require a strong alkaline environment with a pH>10.5 at the end of the stages. In some embodiments, the sodium hydroxide may be used to digest tissues. This process may involve placing of a carcass into a sealed chamber and then putting the carcass in a mixture of sodium hydroxide and water, which may break chemical bonds keeping the body intact. In some embodiments, the sodium hydroxide may be used in Bayer process where the sodium hydroxide is used in the refining of alumina containing ores (bauxite) to produce alumina (aluminium oxide). The alumina is the raw material that may be used to produce aluminium metal via the electrolytic Hall-Héroult process. The alumina may dissolve in the sodium hydroxide, leaving impurities less soluble at high pH such as iron oxides behind in the form of a highly alkaline red mud. In some embodiments, the sodium hydroxide may be used in soap making process. In some embodiments, the sodium hydroxide may be used in the manufacture of biodiesel where the sodium hydroxide may be used as a catalyst for the trans-esterification of methanol and triglycerides. In some embodiments, the sodium hydroxide may be used as a cleansing agent, such as, but not limited to, degreaser on stainless and glass bakeware. In some embodiments, the sodium hydroxide may be used in food preparation. Food uses of sodium hydroxide include, but not limited to, washing or chemical peeling of fruits and vegetables, chocolate and cocoa processing, caramel coloring production, poultry scalding, soft drink processing, and thickening ice cream. Olives may be soaked in sodium hydroxide to soften them, while pretzels and German lye rolls may be glazed with a sodium hydroxide solution before baking to make them crisp. In some embodiments, the sodium hydroxide may be used in homes as a drain cleaning agent for clearing clogged drains. In some embodiments, the sodium hydroxide may be used as a relaxer to straighten hair. In some embodiments, the sodium hydroxide may be used in oil refineries and for oil drilling, as it may increase the viscosity and prevent heavy materials from settling. In the chemical industry, the sodium hydroxide may provide functions of neutralisation of acids, hydrolysis, condensation, saponification, and replacement of other groups in organic compounds of hydroxyl ions. In some embodiments, the sodium hydroxide may be used in textile industry. Mercerizing of fiber with sodium hydroxide solution may enable greater tensional strength and consistent lustre. It may also remove waxes and oils from fiber to make the fiber more receptive to bleaching and dying. Sodium hydroxide may also be used in the production of viscose rayon. In some embodiments, the sodium hydroxide may be used to make sodium hypochlorite which may be used as a household bleach and disinfectant and to make sodium phenolate which may be used in antiseptics and for the manufacture of Aspirin. Contact of Carbon Dioxide with Cathode Electrolyte In one aspect, there are provided methods and systems as described herein, that include contacting carbon dioxide with the cathode electrolyte either inside the cathode chamber or outside the cathode chamber. In one aspect, there are provided methods including contacting an anode with a metal ion in an anode electrolyte in an anode chamber; converting or oxidizing the metal ion from a lower oxidation state to a higher oxidation state in the anode chamber; contacting a cathode with a cathode electrolyte in a cathode chamber; forming an alkali in the cathode electrolyte; and contacting the alkali in the cathode electrolyte with carbon from a source of carbon, such as carbon dioxide from a source of carbon dioxide. In some embodiments, the methods further comprises using the metal in the higher oxidation state formed in the anode chamber as is (as described herein) or use it for reaction with hydrogen gas or reaction with unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbons (as described herein). In some embodiments, there is provided a method comprising contacting an anode with an anode electrolyte; oxidizing metal ion from a lower oxidation state to a higher oxidation state at the anode; contacting a cathode with a cathode electrolyte; producing hydroxide ions in the cathode electrolyte; and contacting the cathode electrolyte with an industrial waste gas comprising carbon dioxide or with a solution of carbon dioxide comprising bicarbonate ions. In another aspect, there are provided systems including an anode chamber containing an anode in contact with a metal ion in an anode electrolyte, wherein the anode is configured to convert the metal ion from a lower oxidation state to a higher oxidation state; a cathode chamber containing a cathode in contact with a cathode electrolyte wherein the cathode is configured to produce an alkali; and a contactor operably connected to the cathode chamber and configured to contact carbon from a source of carbon such as carbon dioxide from a source of carbon dioxide with the alkali in the cathode electrolyte. In some embodiments, the system further includes a reactor operably connected to the anode chamber and configured to react the metal ion in the higher oxidation state with hydrogen gas or with unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbons (as described herein). In some embodiments, the carbon from the source of carbon is treated with the cathode electrolyte to form a solution of dissolved carbon dioxide in the alkali of the cathode electrolyte. The alkali present in the cathode electrolyte may facilitate dissolution of carbon dioxide in the solution. The solution with dissolved carbon dioxide includes carbonic acid, bicarbonate, carbonate, or any combination thereof. In such method and system, the carbon from the source of carbon includes gaseous carbon dioxide from an industrial process or a solution of carbon dioxide from a gas/liquid contactor which is in contact with the gaseous carbon dioxide from the industrial process. Such contactor is further defined herein. In some embodiments of the systems including the contactor, the cathode chamber includes bicarbonate and carbonate ions in addition to hydroxide ions. An illustrative example of an electrochemical system integrated with carbon from a source of carbon is as illustrated in FIG. 12. It is to be understood that the system 1200 of FIG. 12 is for illustration purposes only and other metal ions with different oxidations states (e.g., chromium, tin etc.); other electrochemical systems described herein such as electrochemical systems of FIGS. 1A, 1B, 2, 3A, 3B, 4A, 5A, 5C, 6, 8A, 8B, 9, and 11; and the third electrolyte other than sodium chloride such as sodium sulfate, are variations that are equally applicable to this system. The electrochemical system 1200 of FIG. 12 includes an anode and a cathode separated by anion exchange membrane and cation exchange membrane creating a third chamber containing a third electrolyte, NaCl. The metal ion is oxidized in the anode chamber from the lower oxidation state to the higher oxidation state which metal in the higher oxidation state is then used for reactions in a reactor, such as reaction with hydrogen gas or reaction with unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbon. The products formed by such reactions are described herein. The cathode is illustrated as hydrogen gas forming cathode in FIG. 12 although an ODC is equally applicable to this system. The cathode chamber is connected with a gas/liquid contactor that is in contact with gaseous carbon dioxide. The cathode electrolyte containing alkali such as hydroxide and/or sodium carbonate is circulated to the gas/liquid contactor which brings the cathode electrolyte in contact with the gaseous carbon dioxide resulting in the formation of sodium bicarbonate/sodium carbonate solution. This solution of dissolved carbon dioxide is then circulated to the cathode chamber where the alkali formed at the cathode converts the bicarbonate ions to the carbonate ions bringing the pH of the cathode electrolyte to less than 12. This in turn brings the voltage of the cell down to less than 2 V. The sodium carbonate solution thus formed may be re-circulated back to the gas/liquid contactor for further contact with gaseous carbon dioxide or may be taken out for carrying out the calcium carbonate precipitation process as described herein. In some embodiments, the gaseous carbon dioxide is administered directly into the cathode chamber without the intermediate use of the gas/liquid contactor. In some embodiments, the bicarbonate solution from the gas/liquid contactor is not administered to the cathode chamber but is instead used for the precipitation of the bicarbonate product. The methods and systems related to the contact of the carbon from the source of carbon with the cathode electrolyte (when cathode is either ODC or hydrogen gas producing cathode), as described herein and illustrated in FIG. 12, may result in voltage savings as compared to methods and systems that do not contact the carbon from the source of carbon with the cathode electrolyte. The voltage savings in-turn may result in less electricity consumption and less carbon dioxide emission for electricity generation. This may result in the generation of greener chemicals such as sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium/magnesium bicarbonate or carbonate, halogentated hydrocarbons and/or acids, that are formed by the efficient and energy saving methods and systems of the invention. In some embodiments, the electrochemical cell, where carbon from the source of carbon (such as carbon dioxide gas or sodium carbonate/bicarbonate solution from the gas/liquid contactor) is contacted with the alkali generated by the cathode, has a theoretical cathode half cell voltage saving or theoretical total cell voltage savings of more than 0.1V, or more than 0.2V, or more than 0.5V, or more than 1V, or more than 1.5V, or between 0.1-1.5V, or between 0.1-1V, or between 0.2-1.5V, or between 0.2-1V, or between 0.5-1.5V, or between 0.5-1V as compared to the electrochemical cell where no carbon is contacted with the alkali from the cathode such as, ODC or the hydrogen gas producing cathode. In some embodiments, this voltage saving is achieved with a cathode electrolyte pH of between 7-13, or between 6-12, or between 7-12, or between 7-10, or between 6-13. Based on the Nernst equation explained earlier, when metal in the lower oxidation state is oxidized to metal in the higher oxidation state at the anode as follows: [in-line-formulae]Cu+→Cu2++2e−[/in-line-formulae] Eanode based on concentration of copper II species is between 0.159-0.75V. When water is reduced to hydroxide ions and hydrogen gas at the cathode (as illustrated in FIG. 4A or FIG. 12) and the hydroxide ions come into contact with the bicarbonate ions (such as carbon dioxide gas dissolved directly into the cathode electrolyte or sodium carbonate/bicarbonate solution from the gas/liquid contactor circulated into the cathode electrolyte) to form carbonate, the pH of the cathode electrolyte goes down from 14 to less than 14, as follows: [in-line-formulae]Ecathode=−0.059 pHc, where pHc is the pH of the cathode electrolyte=10[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]Ecathode=−0.59[/in-line-formulae] The Etotal then is between 0.749 to 1.29, depending on the concentration of copper ions in the anode electrolyte. The Ecathode=−0.59 is a saving of more than 200 mV or between 200 mV to 500 mV or between 100-500 mV over the Ecathode=−0.83 for the hydrogen gas producing cathode that is not in contact with bicarbonate/carbonate ions. The ETotal=0.749 to 1.29 is a saving of more than 200 mV or between 200 mV-1.2V or between 100 mV-1.5V over the Etotal=0.989 to 1.53 for the hydrogen gas producing cathode that is not in contact with bicarbonate/carbonate ions. Similarly, when water is reduced to hydroxide ions at ODC (as illustrated in FIG. 5A) and the hydroxide ions come into contact with the bicarbonate ions (such as carbon dioxide gas dissolved directly into the cathode electrolyte or sodium carbonate/bicarbonate solution from the gas/liquid contactor circulated into the cathode electrolyte) to form carbonate, the pH of the cathode electrolyte goes down from 14 to less than 14, as follows: [in-line-formulae]Ecathode=1.224-0.059 pHc, where pHc=10[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]Ecathode=0.636V[/in-line-formulae] ETotal then is between −0.477 to 0.064V depending on the concentration of copper ions in the anode electrolyte. The Ecathode=0.636 is a saving of more than 100 mV or between 100 mV to 200 mV or between 100-500 mV or between 200-500 mV over the Ecathode=0.4 for the ODC that is not in contact with bicarbonate/carbonate ions. The ETotal=−0.477 to 0.064V is a saving of more than 200 mV or between 200 mV-1.2V or between 100 mV-1.5V over the ETotal=−0.241 to 0.3 for the ODC that is not in contact with bicarbonate/carbonate ions. As described above, as the cathode electrolyte is allowed to increase to a pH of 14 or greater, the difference between the anode half-cell potential and the cathode half cell potential would increase. With increased duration of cell operation without CO2 addition or other intervention, e.g., diluting with water, the required cell potential would continue to increase. The operation of the electrochemical cell with the cathode pH between 7-13 or between 7-12 provides a significant energy savings. Thus, for different pH values, in the cathode electrolyte, hydroxide ions, carbonate ions and/or bicarbonate ions are produced in the cathode electrolyte when the voltage applied across the anode and cathode is less than 2.9, or less than 2.5, or less than 2.1, or 2.0, or less than 1.5, or less than 1.0, or less than 0.5, or between 0.5-1.5V, while the pH in the cathode electrolyte is between 7-13 or 7-12 or 6-12 or 7-10. In some embodiments, the source of carbon is any gaseous source of carbon dioxide and/or any source that provides dissolved form or solution of carbon dioxide. The dissolved form of carbon dioxide or solution of carbon dioxide includes carbonic acid, bicarbonate ions, carbonate ions, or combination thereof. In some embodiments, the oxygen gas and/or carbon dioxide gas supplied to the cathode is from any oxygen source and carbon dioxide gas source known in the art. The source of oxygen gas and the source of carbon dioxide gas may be same or may be different. Some examples of the oxygen gas source and carbon dioxide gas source are as described herein. In some embodiments, the alkali produced in the cathode chamber may be treated with a gaseous stream of carbon dioxide and/or a dissolved form of carbon dioxide to form carbonate/bicarbonate products which may be used as is for commercial purposes or may be treated with divalent cations, such as, but not limited to, alkaline earth metal ions to form alkaline earth metal carbonates and/or bicarbonates. As used herein, “carbon from source of carbon” includes gaseous form of carbon dioxide or dissolved form or solution of carbon dioxide. The carbon from source of carbon includes CO2, carbonic acid, bicarbonate ions, carbonate ions, or a combination thereof. As used herein, “source of carbon” includes any source that provides gaseous and/or dissolved form of carbon dioxide. The sources of carbon include, but not limited to, waste streams or industrial processes that provide a gaseous stream of CO2; a gas/liquid contactor that provides a solution containing CO2, carbonic acid, bicarbonate ions, carbonate ions, or combination thereof; and/or bicarbonate brine solution. The gaseous CO2 is, in some embodiments, a waste stream or product from an industrial plant. The nature of the industrial plant may vary in these embodiments. The industrial plants include, but not limited to, refineries that form unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbons, power plants (e.g., as described in detail in International Application No. PCT/US08/88318, titled, “Methods of sequestering CO2,” filed 24 Dec. 2008, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), chemical processing plants, steel mills, paper mills, cement plants (e.g., as described in further detail in U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/088,340, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), and other industrial plants that produce CO2 as a byproduct. By waste stream is meant a stream of gas (or analogous stream) that is produced as a byproduct of an active process of the industrial plant. The gaseous stream may be substantially pure CO2 or a multi-component gaseous stream that includes CO2 and one or more additional gases. Multi-component gaseous streams (containing CO2) that may be employed as a CO2 source in embodiments of the methods include both reducing, e.g., syngas, shifted syngas, natural gas, and hydrogen and the like, and oxidizing condition streams, e.g., flue gases from combustion, such as combustion of methane. Exhaust gases containing NOx, SOx, VOCs, particulates and Hg would incorporate these compounds along with the carbonate in the precipitated product. Particular multi-component gaseous streams of interest that may be treated according to the subject invention include, but not limited to, oxygen containing combustion power plant flue gas, turbo charged boiler product gas, coal gasification product gas, shifted coal gasification product gas, anaerobic digester product gas, wellhead natural gas stream, reformed natural gas or methane hydrates, and the like. In instances where the gas contains both carbon dioxide and oxygen gas, the gas may be used both as a source of carbon dioxide as well as a source of oxygen. For example, flue gases obtained from the combustion of oxygen and methane may contain oxygen gas and may provide a source of both carbon dioxide gas as well as oxygen gas. Thus, the waste streams may be produced from a variety of different types of industrial plants. Suitable waste streams for the invention include waste streams, such as, flue gas, produced by industrial plants that combust fossil fuels (e.g., coal, oil, natural gas) or anthropogenic fuel products of naturally occurring organic fuel deposits (e.g., tar sands, heavy oil, oil shale, etc.). In some embodiments, a waste stream suitable for systems and methods of the invention is sourced from a coal-fired power plant, such as a pulverized coal power plant, a supercritical coal power plant, a mass burn coal power plant, a fluidized bed coal power plant. In some embodiments, the waste stream is sourced from gas or oil-fired boiler and steam turbine power plants, gas or oil-fired boiler simple cycle gas turbine power plants, or gas or oil-fired boiler combined cycle gas turbine power plants. In some embodiments, waste streams produced by power plants that combust syngas (i.e., gas that is produced by the gasification of organic matter, for example, coal, biomass, etc.) are used. In some embodiments, waste streams from integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants are used. In some embodiments, waste streams produced by Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) plants are used to produce compositions in accordance with systems and methods provided herein. Waste streams produced by cement plants are also suitable for systems and methods provided herein. Cement plant waste streams include waste streams from both wet process and dry process plants, which plants may employ shaft kilns or rotary kilns, and may include pre-calciners. These industrial plants may each burn a single fuel, or may burn two or more fuels sequentially or simultaneously. Although carbon dioxide may be present in ordinary ambient air, in view of its very low concentration, ambient carbon dioxide may not provide sufficient carbon dioxide to achieve the formation of the bicarbonate and/or carbonate as is obtained when carbon from the source of carbon is contacted with the cathode electrolyte. In some embodiments of the system and method, the pressure inside the electrochemical system may be greater than the ambient atmospheric pressure in the ambient air and hence ambient carbon dioxide may typically be prevented from infiltrating into the cathode electrolyte. The contact system or the contactor includes any means for contacting the carbon from the source of carbon to the cathode electrolyte inside a cathode chamber or outside the cathode chamber. Such means for contacting the carbon to the cathode electrolyte or the contactor configured to contact carbon from a source of carbon with the cathode chamber, are well known in the art and include, but not limited to, injection, pipe, duct, conduit, and the like. In some embodiments, the system includes a duct that directs the carbon to the cathode electrolyte inside a cathode chamber. It is to be understood that when the carbon from the source of carbon is contacted with the cathode electrolyte inside the cathode chamber, the carbon may be injected to the cathode electrolyte from the bottom of the cell, top of the cell, from the side inlet in the cell, and/or from all entry ports depending on the amount of carbon desired in the cathode chamber. The amount of carbon from the source of carbon inside the cathode chamber may be dependent on the flow rate of the solution, desired pH of the cathode electrolyte, and/or size of the cell. Such optimization of the amount of the carbon from the source of carbon is well within the scope of the invention. In some embodiments, the carbon from the source of carbon is selected from gaseous carbon dioxide from an industrial process or a solution of carbon dioxide from a gas/liquid contactor in contact with the gaseous carbon dioxide from the industrial process. In some embodiments, the cathode chamber includes a partition that helps facilitate delivery of the carbon dioxide gas and/or solution of carbon dioxide in the cathode chamber. In some embodiments, the partition may help prevent mixing of the carbon dioxide gas with the oxygen gas and/or mixing of the carbon dioxide gas in the cathode chamber with the hydrogen gas in the anode chamber. In some embodiments, the partition results in the catholyte with a gaseous form of carbon dioxide as well as dissolved form of carbon dioxide. In some embodiments, the systems provided herein include a partition that partitions the cathode electrolyte into a first cathode electrolyte portion and a second cathode electrolyte portion, where the second cathode electrolyte portion that includes dissolved carbon dioxide contacts the cathode; and where the first cathode electrolyte portion that includes dissolved carbon dioxide and gaseous carbon dioxide, contacts the second cathode electrolyte portion under the partition. In the system, the partition is positioned in the cathode electrolyte such that a gas, e.g., carbon dioxide in the first cathode electrolyte portion is isolated from cathode electrolyte in the second cathode electrolyte portion. Thus, the partition may serve as a means to prevent mixing of the gases on the cathode and/or the gases and or vapor from the anode. Such partition is described in U.S. Publication No. 2010/0084280, filed Nov. 12, 2009, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,993,511 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety in the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the source of carbon is a gas/liquid contactor that provides a dissolved form or solution of carbon dioxide containing CO2, carbonic acid, bicarbonate ions, carbonate ions, or combination thereof. In some embodiments, the solution charged with the partially or fully dissolved CO2 is made by sparging or diffusing the CO2 gaseous stream through slurry or solution to make a CO2 charged water. In some embodiments, the slurry or solution charged with CO2 includes a proton removing agent obtained from the cathode electrolyte of an electrochemical cell, as described herein. In some embodiments, the gas/liquid contactor may include a bubble chamber where the CO2 gas is bubbled through the slurry or the solution containing the proton removing agent. In some embodiments, the contactor may include a spray tower where the slurry or the solution containing the proton removing agent is sprayed or circulated through the CO2 gas. In some embodiments, the contactor may include a pack bed to increase the surface area of contact between the CO2 gas and the solution containing the proton removing agent. For example, the gas/liquid contactor or the absorber may contain a slurry or solution or pack bed of sodium carbonate. The CO2 is sparged through this slurry or the solution or the pack bed where the alkaline medium facilitates dissolution of CO2 in the solution. After the dissolution of CO2, the solution may contain bicarbonate, carbonate, or combination thereof. In some embodiments, a typical absorber or the contactor fluid temperature is 32-37° C. The absorber or contactor for absorbing CO2 in the solution is described in U.S. application Ser. No. 12/721,549, filed on Mar. 10, 2010, now abandoned which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety in the present disclosure. The solution containing the carbonate/bicarbonate species may be withdrawn from the gas/liquid contactor to form bicarbonate/carbonate products. In some embodiments, the carbonate/bicarbonate solution may be transferred to the cathode electrolyte containing the alkali. The alkali may substantially or fully convert the bicarbonate to carbonate to form carbonate solution. The carbonate solution may be re-circulated back to the gas/liquid contactor or may be withdrawn from the cathode chamber and treated with divalent cations to form bicarbonate/carbonate products. In some embodiments, the alkali produced in the cathode electrolyte may be delivered to the gas/liquid contactor where the carbon dioxide gas comes into contact with the alkali. The carbon dioxide gas after coming into contact with the alkali may result in the formation of carbonic acid, bicarbonate ions, carbonate ions, or combination thereof. The dissolved form of carbon dioxide may be then delivered back to the cathode chamber where the alkali may convert the bicarbonate into the carbonate. The carbonate/bicarbonate mix may be then used as is for commercial purposes or is treated with divalent cations, such as, alkaline earth metal ions to form alkaline earth metal carbonates/bicarbonates. The system in some embodiments includes a cathode electrolyte circulating system adapted for withdrawing and circulating cathode electrolyte in the system. In some embodiments, the cathode electrolyte circulating system includes a gas/liquid contactor outside the cathode chamber that is adapted for contacting the carbon from the source of carbon with the circulating cathode electrolyte, and for re-circulating the electrolyte in the system. As the pH of the cathode electrolyte may be adjusted by withdrawing and/or circulating cathode electrolyte/carbon from the source of carbon from the system, the pH of the cathode electrolyte compartment can be regulated by regulating an amount of cathode electrolyte removed from the system, passed through the gas/liquid contactor, and/or re-circulated back into the cathode chamber. In some embodiments, the source of carbon is the bicarbonate brine solution. The bicarbonate brine solution, is as described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/433,641, filed on Jan. 18, 2011 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/408,325, filed Oct. 29, 2010, which are both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety in the present disclosure. As used herein, the “bicarbonate brine solution” includes any brine containing bicarbonate ions. In some embodiments, the brine is a synthetic brine such as a solution of brine containing the bicarbonate, e.g., sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, lithium bicarbonate etc. In some embodiments, the brine is a naturally occurring bicarbonate brine, e.g., subterranean brine such as naturally occurring lakes. In some embodiments, the bicarbonate brine is made from subterranean brines, such as but not limited to, carbonate brines, alkaline brines, hard brines, and/or alkaline hard brines. In some embodiments, the bicarbonate brine is made from minerals where the minerals are crushed and dissolved in brine and optionally further processed. The minerals can be found under the surface, on the surface, or subsurface of the lakes. The bicarbonate brine can also be made from evaporite. The bicarbonate brine may include other oxyanions of carbon in addition to bicarbonate (HCO3−), such as, but not limited to, carbonic acid (H2CO3) and/or carbonate (CO32−). In some embodiments of the electrochemical cells described herein, the system is configured to produce carbonate ions by a reaction of the carbon such as, CO2, carbonic acid, bicarbonate ions, carbonate ions, or combination thereof, from the source of carbon with an alkali, such as, sodium hydroxide from the cathode electrolyte. In some embodiments (not shown in figures), the carbon from the source of carbon, such as gaseous form of carbon dioxide may be contacted with the catholyte inside the cathode chamber and the catholyte containing hydroxide/carbonate/bicarbonate may be withdrawn from the cathode chamber and contacted with the gas/liquid contactor outside the cathode chamber. In such embodiments, the catholyte from the gas/liquid contactor may be contacted back again with the catholyte inside the cathode chamber. For the systems where the carbon from the source of carbon is contacted with the cathode electrolyte outside the cathode chamber, the alkali containing cathode electrolyte may be withdrawn from the cathode chamber and may be added to a container configured to contain the carbon from the source of carbon. The container may have an input for the source of carbon such as a pipe or conduit, etc. or a pipeline in communication with the gaseous stream of CO2, a solution containing dissolved form of CO2, and/or the bicarbonate brine. The container may also be in fluid communication with a reactor where the source of carbon, such as, e.g. bicarbonate brine solution may be produced, modified, and/or stored. For the systems where the carbon from the source of carbon is contacted with the cathode electrolyte inside the cathode chamber, the cathode electrolyte containing alkali, bicarbonate, and/or carbonate may be withdrawn from the cathode chamber and may be contacted with alkaline earth metal ions, as described herein, to form bicarbonate/carbonate products.

Examples of cationic exchange membranes include, but not limited to, cationic membrane consisting of a perfluorinated polymer containing anionic groups, for example sulphonic and/or carboxylic groups. However, it may be appreciated that in some embodiments, depending on the need to restrict or allow migration of a specific cation or an anion species between the electrolytes, a cation exchange membrane that is more restrictive and thus allows migration of one species of cations while restricting the migration of another species of cations may be used as, e.g., a cation exchange membrane that allows migration of sodium ions into the cathode electrolyte from the anode electrolyte while restricting migration of other ions from the anode electrolyte into the cathode electrolyte, may be used. Similarly, in some embodiments, depending on the need to restrict or allow migration of a specific anion species between the electrolytes, an anion exchange membrane that is more restrictive and thus allows migration of one species of anions while restricting the migration of another species of anions may be used as, e.g., an anion exchange membrane that allows migration of chloride ions into the anode electrolyte from the cathode electrolyte while restricting migration of hydroxide ions from the cathode electrolyte into the anode electrolyte, may be used. Such restrictive cation and/or anion exchange membranes are commercially available and can be selected by one ordinarily skilled in the art. In some embodiments, there is provided a system comprising one or more anion exchange membrane, and cation exchange membranes located between the anode and the cathode. In some embodiments, the membranes should be selected such that they can function in an acidic and/or basic electrolytic solution as appropriate. Other desirable characteristics of the membranes include high ion selectivity, low ionic resistance, high burst strength, and high stability in an acidic electrolytic solution in a temperature range of 0° C. to 100° C. or higher, or a alkaline solution in similar temperature range may be used. In some embodiments, it is desirable that the ion exchange membrane prevents the transport of the metal ion from the anolyte to the catholyte. In some embodiments, a membrane that is stable in the range of 0° C. to 90° C.; or 0° C. to 80° C.; or 0° C. to 70° C.; or 0° C. to 60° C.; or 0° C. to 50° C.; or 0° C. to 40° C., or 0° C. to 30° C., or 0° C. to 20° C., or 0° C. to 10° C., or higher may be used. In some embodiments, a membrane that is stable in the range of 0° C. to 90° C.; or 0° C. to 80° C.; or 0° C. to 70° C.; or 0° C. to 60° C.; or 0° C. to 50° C.; or 0° C. to 40° C., but unstable at higher temperature, may be used. For other embodiments, it may be useful to utilize an ion-specific ion exchange membranes that allows migration of one type of cation but not another; or migration of one type of anion and not another, to achieve a desired product or products in an electrolyte. In some embodiments, the membrane may be stable and functional for a desirable length of time in the system, e.g., several days, weeks or months or years at temperatures in the range of 0° C. to 90° C.; or 0° C. to 80° C.; or 0° C. to 70° C.; or 0° C. to 60° C.; or 0° C. to 50° C.; or 0° C. to 40° C.; or 0° C. to 30° C.; or 0° C. to 20° C.; or 0° C. to 10° C., and higher and/or lower. In some embodiments, for example, the membranes may be stable and functional for at least 1 day, at least 5 days, 10 days, 15 days, 20 days, 100 days, 1000 days, 5-10 years, or more in electrolyte temperatures at 100° C., 90° C., 80° C., 70° C., 60° C., 50° C., 40° C., 30° C., 20° C., 10° C., 5° C. and more or less. The ohmic resistance of the membranes may affect the voltage drop across the anode and cathode, e.g., as the ohmic resistance of the membranes increase, the voltage across the anode and cathode may increase, and vice versa. Membranes that can be used include, but are not limited to, membranes with relatively low ohmic resistance and relatively high ionic mobility; and membranes with relatively high hydration characteristics that increase with temperatures, and thus decreasing the ohmic resistance. By selecting membranes with lower ohmic resistance known in the art, the voltage drop across the anode and the cathode at a specified temperature can be lowered. Scattered through membranes may be ionic channels including acid groups. These ionic channels may extend from the internal surface of the matrix to the external surface and the acid groups may readily bind water in a reversible reaction as water-of-hydration. This binding of water as water-of-hydration may follow first order reaction kinetics, such that the rate of reaction is proportional to temperature. Consequently, membranes can be selected to provide a relatively low ohmic and ionic resistance while providing for improved strength and resistance in the system for a range of operating temperatures. In some embodiments, the carbon from the source of carbon, when contacted with the cathode electrolyte inside the cathode chamber, reacts with the hydroxide ions and produces water and carbonate ions, depending on the pH of the cathode electrolyte. The addition of the carbon from the source of carbon to the cathode electrolyte may lower the pH of the cathode electrolyte. Thus, depending on the degree of alkalinity desired in the cathode electrolyte, the pH of the cathode electrolyte may be adjusted and in some embodiments is maintained between 6 and 12; between 7 and 14 or greater; or between 7 and 13; or between 7 and 12; or between 7 and 11; or between 7 and 10; or between 7 and 9; or between 7 and 8; or between 8 and 14 or greater; or between 8 and 13; or between 8 and 12; or between 8 and 11; or between 8 and 10; or between 8 and 9; or between 9 and 14 or greater; or between 9 and 13; or between 9 and 12; or between 9 and 11; or between 9 and 10; or between 10 and 14 or greater; or between 10 and 13; or between 10 and 12; or between 10 and 11; or between 11 and 14 or greater; or between 11 and 13; or between 11 and 12; or between 12 and 14 or greater; or between 12 and 13; or between 13 and 14 or greater. In some embodiments, the pH of the cathode electrolyte may be adjusted to any value between 7 and 14 or greater, a pH less than 12, a pH 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10.0, 10.5, 11.0, 11.5, 12.0, 12.5, 13.0, 13.5, 14.0, and/or greater. Similarly, in some embodiments of the system, the pH of the anode electrolyte is adjusted and is maintained between 0-7; or between 0-6; or between 0-5; or between 0-4; or between 0-3; or between 0-2; or between 0-1. As the voltage across the anode and cathode may be dependent on several factors including the difference in pH between the anode electrolyte and the cathode electrolyte (as can be determined by the Nernst equation well known in the art), in some embodiments, the pH of the anode electrolyte may be adjusted to a value between 0 and 7, including 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 and 7, depending on the desired operating voltage across the anode and cathode. Thus, in equivalent systems, where it is desired to reduce the energy used and/or the voltage across the anode and cathode, e.g., as in the chlor-alkali process, the carbon from the source of carbon can be added to the cathode electrolyte as disclosed herein to achieve a desired pH difference between the anode electrolyte and cathode electrolyte. The system may be configured to produce any desired pH difference between the anode electrolyte and the cathode electrolyte by modulating the pH of the anode electrolyte, the pH of the cathode electrolyte, the concentration of hydroxide in the cathode electrolyte, the withdrawal and replenishment of the anode electrolyte, the withdrawal and replenishment of the cathode electrolyte, and/or the amount of the carbon from the source of carbon added to the cathode electrolyte. By modulating the pH difference between the anode electrolyte and the cathode electrolyte, the voltage across the anode and the cathode can be modulated. In some embodiments, the system is configured to produce a pH difference of at least 4 pH units; at least 5 pH units; at least 6 pH units; at least 7 pH units; at least 8 pH units; at least 9 pH units; at least 10 pH units; at least 11 pH units; at least 12 pH units; at least 13 pH units; at least 14 pH units; or between 4-12 pH units; or between 4-11 pH units; or between 4-10 pH units; or between 4-9 pH units; or between 4-8 pH units; or between 4-7 pH units; or between 4-6 pH units; or between 4-5 pH units; or between 3-12 pH units; or between 3-11 pH units; or between 3-10 pH units; or between 3-9 pH units; or between 3-8 pH units; or between 3-7 pH units; or between 3-6 pH units; or between 3-5 pH units; or between 3-4 pH units; or between 5-12 pH units; or between 5-11 pH units; or between 5-10 pH units; or between 5-9 pH units; or between 5-8 pH units; or between 5-7 pH units; or between 5-6 pH units; or between 6-12 pH units; or between 6-11 pH units; or between 6-10 pH units; or between 6-9 pH units; or between 6-8 pH units; or between 6-7 pH units; or between 7-12 pH units; or between 7-11 pH units; or between 7-10 pH units; or between 7-9 pH units; or between 7-8 pH units; or between 8-12 pH units; or between 8-11 pH units; or between 8-10 pH units; or between 8-9 pH units; or between 9-12 pH units; or between 9-11 pH units; or between 9-10 pH units; or between 10-12 pH units; or between 10-11 pH units; or between 11-12 pH units; between the anode electrolyte and the cathode electrolyte. In some embodiments, the system is configured to produce a pH difference of at least 4 pH units between the anode electrolyte and the cathode electrolyte. In some embodiments, the anode electrolyte and the cathode electrolyte in the electrochemical cell, in the methods and systems provided herein, are operated at room temperature or at elevated temperatures, such as, e.g., at more than 40° C., or more than 50° C., or more than 60° C., or more than 70° C., or more than 80° C., or between 30-70° C. Production of Bicarbonate and/or Carbonate Products In some embodiments, the methods and systems provided herein are configured to process the carbonate/bicarbonate solution obtained after the cathode electrolyte is contacted with the carbon from the source of carbon. In some embodiments, the carbonate and/or bicarbonate containing solution is treated with divalent cations, such as but not limited to, calcium and/or magnesium to form calcium and/or magnesium carbonate and/or bicarbonate. An illustrative embodiment for such processes is provided in FIG. 13. As illustrated in FIG. 13, process 1300 illustrates methods and systems to process the carbonate/bicarbonate solution obtained after the cathode electrolyte is contacted with the carbon from the source of carbon. In some embodiments, the solution is subjected to the precipitation in the precipitator 1301. In some embodiments, the solution includes sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and/or sodium bicarbonate. In some embodiments, the system is configured to treat bicarbonate and/or carbonate ions in the cathode electrolyte with an alkaline earth metal ion or divalent cation including, but not limited to, calcium, magnesium, and combination thereof. The “divalent cation” as used herein, includes any solid or solution that contains divalent cations, such as, alkaline earth metal ions or any aqueous medium containing alkaline earth metals. The alkaline earth metals include calcium, magnesium, strontium, barium, etc. or combinations thereof. The divalent cations (e.g., alkaline earth metal cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+) may be found in industrial wastes, seawater, brines, hard water, minerals, and many other suitable sources. The alkaline-earth-metal-containing water includes fresh water or saltwater, depending on the method employing the water. In some embodiments, the water employed in the process includes one or more alkaline earth metals, e.g., magnesium, calcium, etc. In some embodiments, the alkaline earth metal ions are present in an amount of 1% to 99% by wt; or 1% to 95% by wt; or 1% to 90% by wt; or 1% to 80% by wt; or 1% to 70% by wt; or 1% to 60% by wt; or 1% to 50% by wt; or 1% to 40% by wt; or 1% to 30% by wt; or 1% to 20% by wt; or 1% to 10% by wt; or 20% to 95% by wt; or 20% to 80% by wt; or 20% to 50% by wt; or 50% to 95% by wt; or 50% to 80% by wt; or 50% to 75% by wt; or 75% to 90% by wt; or 75% to 80% by wt; or 80% to 90% by wt of the solution containing the alkaline earth metal ions. In some embodiments, the alkaline earth metal ions are present in saltwater, such as, seawater. In some embodiments, the source of divalent cations is hard water or naturally occurring hard brines. In some embodiments, calcium rich waters may be combined with magnesium silicate minerals, such as olivine or serpentine. In some embodiments, gypsum (e.g. from Solvay process) provides a source of divalent cation such as, but not limited to, calcium ions. After the precipitation of the calcium carbonate/bicarbonate using the carbonate/bicarbonate solution from the cathode chamber and the calcium from gypsum, the supernatant containing sodium sulfate may be circulated to the electrochemical systems described herein. The sodium sulfate solution may be used in combination with metal sulfate such as copper sulfate such the Cu(I) ions are oxidized to Cu (II) ions in the anode chamber and are used further for the sulfonation of hydrogen gases or for the sulfonation of unsaturated or saturated hydrocarbons. In such embodiments, the electrochemical system is fully integrated with the precipitation process. Such use of gypsum as a source of calcium is described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/514,879, filed Aug. 3, 2011, which is fully incorporate herein by reference in its entirety. In some locations, industrial waste streams from various industrial processes provide for convenient sources of cations (as well as in some cases other materials useful in the process, e.g., metal hydroxide). Such waste streams include, but are not limited to, mining wastes; fossil fuel burning ash (e.g., fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag); slag (e.g., iron slag, phosphorous slag); cement kiln waste (e.g., cement kiln dust); oil refinery/petrochemical refinery waste (e.g., oil field and methane seam brines); coal seam wastes (e.g., gas production brines and coal seam brine); paper processing waste; water softening waste brine (e.g., ion exchange effluent); silicon processing wastes; agricultural waste; metal finishing waste; high pH textile waste; and caustic sludge. In some embodiments, the aqueous solution of cations include calcium and/or magnesium in amounts ranging from 10-50,000 ppm; or 10-10,000 ppm; or 10-5,000 ppm; or 10-1,000 ppm; or 10-100 ppm; or 50-50,000 ppm; or 50-10,000 ppm; or 50-1,000 ppm; or 50-100 ppm; or 100-50,000 ppm; or 100-10,000 ppm; or 100-1,000 ppm; or 100-500 ppm; or 1,000-50,000 ppm; or 1,000-10,000 ppm; or 5,000-50,000 ppm; or 5,000-10,000 ppm; or 10,000-50,000 ppm. Freshwater may be a convenient source of cations (e.g., cations of alkaline earth metals such as Ca2+ and Mg2+). Any number of suitable freshwater sources may be used, including freshwater sources ranging from sources relatively free of minerals to sources relatively rich in minerals. Mineral-rich freshwater sources may be naturally occurring, including any of a number of hard water sources, lakes, or inland seas. Some mineral-rich freshwater sources such as alkaline lakes or inland seas (e.g., Lake Van in Turkey) also provide a source of pH-modifying agents. Mineral-rich freshwater sources may also be anthropogenic. For example, a mineral-poor (soft) water may be contacted with a source of cations such as alkaline earth metal cations (e.g., Ca2+, Mg2+, etc.) to produce a mineral-rich water that is suitable for methods and systems described herein. Cations or precursors thereof (e.g., salts, minerals) may be added to freshwater (or any other type of water described herein) using any convenient protocol (e.g., addition of solids, suspensions, or solutions). In some embodiments, divalent cations selected from Ca2+ and Mg2+ are added to freshwater. In some embodiments, freshwater containing Ca2+ is combined with magnesium silicates (e.g., olivine or serpentine), or products or processed forms thereof, yielding a solution comprising calcium and magnesium cations. The precipitate obtained after the contacting of the carbon from the source of carbon with the cathode electrolyte and the divalent cations includes, but is not limited to, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, calcium bicarbonate, magnesium bicarbonate, calcium magnesium carbonate, or combination thereof. In some embodiments, the precipitate may be subjected to one or more of steps including, but not limited to, mixing, stirring, temperature, pH, precipitation, residence time of the precipitate, dewatering of precipitate, washing precipitate with water, ion ratio, concentration of additives, drying, milling, grinding, storing, aging, and curing, to make the carbonate composition of the invention. In some embodiments, the precipitation conditions are such that the carbonate products are metastable forms, such as, but not limited to vaterite, aragonite, amorphous calcium carbonate, or combination thereof. The precipitator 1301 can be a tank or a series of tanks. Contact protocols include, but are not limited to, direct contacting protocols, e.g., flowing the volume of water containing cations, e.g. alkaline earth metal ions through the volume of cathode electrolyte containing sodium hydroxide; concurrent contacting means, e.g., contact between unidirectionally flowing liquid phase streams; and countercurrent means, e.g., contact between oppositely flowing liquid phase streams, and the like. Thus, contact may be accomplished through use of infusers, bubblers, fluidic Venturi reactor, sparger, gas filter, spray, tray, or packed column reactors, and the like, as may be convenient. In some embodiments, the contact is by spray. In some embodiments, the contact is through packed column. In some embodiments, the carbon from the source of carbon is added to the source of cations and the cathode electrolyte containing hydroxide. In some embodiments, the source of cations and the cathode electrolyte containing alkali is added to the carbon from the source of carbon. In some embodiments, both the source of cations and the carbon from the source of carbon are simultaneously added to the cathode electrolyte containing alkali in the precipitator for precipitation. In some embodiments, where the carbon from the source of carbon has been added to the cathode electrolyte inside the cathode chamber, the withdrawn cathode electrolyte including hydroxide, bicarbonate and/or carbonate is administered to the precipitator for further reaction with the divalent cations. In some embodiments, where the carbon from the source of carbon and the divalent cations have been added to the cathode electrolyte inside the cathode chamber, the withdrawn cathode electrolyte including sodium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, calcium bicarbonate, magnesium bicarbonate, calcium magnesium carbonate, or combination thereof, is administered to the precipitator for further processing. The precipitator 1301 containing the solution of calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, calcium bicarbonate, magnesium bicarbonate, calcium magnesium carbonate, or combination thereof is subjected to precipitation conditions. At precipitation step, carbonate compounds, which may be amorphous or crystalline, are precipitated. These carbonate compounds may form a reaction product including carbonic acid, bicarbonate, carbonate, or mixture thereof. The carbonate precipitate may be the self-cementing composition and may be stored as is in the mother liquor or may be further processed to make the cement products. Alternatively, the precipitate may be subjected to further processing to give the hydraulic cement or the supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) compositions. The self-cementing compositions, hydraulic cements, and SCM have been described in U.S. application Ser. No. 12/857,248, filed 16 Aug. 2010, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,922,809 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety in the present disclosure. The one or more conditions or one or more precipitation conditions of interest include those that change the physical environment of the water to produce the desired precipitate product. Such one or more conditions or precipitation conditions include, but are not limited to, one or more of temperature, pH, precipitation, dewatering or separation of the precipitate, drying, milling, and storage. For example, the temperature of the water may be within a suitable range for the precipitation of the desired composition to occur. For example, the temperature of the water may be raised to an amount suitable for precipitation of the desired carbonate compound(s) to occur. In such embodiments, the temperature of the water may be from 5 to 70° C., such as from 20 to 50° C., and including from 25 to 45° C. As such, while a given set of precipitation conditions may have a temperature ranging from 0 to 100° C., the temperature may be raised in certain embodiments to produce the desired precipitate. In certain embodiments, the temperature is raised using energy generated from low or zero carbon dioxide emission sources, e.g., solar energy source, wind energy source, hydroelectric energy source, etc. The residence time of the precipitate in the precipitator before the precipitate is removed from the solution, may vary. In some embodiments, the residence time of the precipitate in the solution is more than 5 seconds, or between 5 seconds-1 hour, or between 5 seconds-1 minute, or between 5 seconds to 20 seconds, or between 5 seconds to 30 seconds, or between 5 seconds to 40 seconds. Without being limited by any theory, it is contemplated that the residence time of the precipitate may affect the size of the particle. For example, a shorter residence time may give smaller size particles or more disperse particles whereas longer residence time may give agglomerated or larger size particles. In some embodiments, the residence time in the process of the invention may be used to make small size as well as large size particles in a single or multiple batches which may be separated or may remain mixed for later steps of the process. The nature of the precipitate may also be influenced by selection of appropriate major ion ratios. Major ion ratios may have influence on polymorph formation, such that the carbonate products are metastable forms, such as, but not limited to vaterite, aragonite, amorphous calcium carbonate, or combination thereof. In some embodiments, the carbonate products may also include calcite. Such polymorphic precipitates are described in U.S. application Ser. No. 12/857,248, filed 16 Aug. 2010, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,922,809 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety in the present disclosure. For example, magnesium may stabilize the vaterite and/or amorphous calcium carbonate in the precipitate. Rate of precipitation may also influence compound polymorphic phase formation and may be controlled in a manner sufficient to produce a desired precipitate product. The most rapid precipitation can be achieved by seeding the solution with a desired polymorphic phase. Without seeding, rapid precipitation can be achieved by rapidly increasing the pH of the sea water. The higher the pH is, the more rapid the precipitation may be. In some embodiments, a set of conditions to produce the desired precipitate from the water include, but are not limited to, the water's temperature and pH, and in some instances the concentrations of additives and ionic species in the water. Precipitation conditions may also include factors such as mixing rate, forms of agitation such as ultrasonics, and the presence of seed crystals, catalysts, membranes, or substrates. In some embodiments, precipitation conditions include supersaturated conditions, temperature, pH, and/or concentration gradients, or cycling or changing any of these parameters. The protocols employed to prepare carbonate compound precipitates according to the invention may be batch or continuous protocols. It will be appreciated that precipitation conditions may be different to produce a given precipitate in a continuous flow system compared to a batch system. Following production of the carbonate precipitate from the water, the resultant precipitated carbonate composition may be separated from the mother liquor or dewatered to produce the precipitate product, as illustrated at step 1302 of FIG. 13. Alternatively, the precipitate is left as is in the mother liquor or mother supernate and is used as a cementing composition. Separation of the precipitate can be achieved using any convenient approach, including a mechanical approach, e.g., where bulk excess water is drained from the precipitated, e.g., either by gravity alone or with the addition of vacuum, mechanical pressing, by filtering the precipitate from the mother liquor to produce a filtrate, etc. Separation of bulk water produces a wet, dewatered precipitate. The dewatering station may be any number of dewatering stations connected to each other to dewater the slurry (e.g., parallel, in series, or combination thereof). The above protocol results in the production of slurry of the precipitate and mother liquor. This precipitate in the mother liquor and/or in the slurry may give the self-cementing composition. In some embodiments, a portion or whole of the dewatered precipitate or the slurry is further processed to make the hydraulic cement or the SCM compositions. Where desired, the compositions made up of the precipitate and the mother liquor may be stored for a period of time following precipitation and prior to further processing. For example, the composition may be stored for a period of time ranging from 1 to 1000 days or longer, such as 1 to 10 days or longer, at a temperature ranging from 1 to 40° C., such as 20 to 25° C. The slurry components are then separated. Embodiments may include treatment of the mother liquor, where the mother liquor may or may not be present in the same composition as the product. The resultant mother liquor of the reaction may be disposed of using any convenient protocol. In certain embodiments, it may be sent to a tailings pond 1307 for disposal. In certain embodiments, it may be disposed of in a naturally occurring body of water, e.g., ocean, sea, lake or river. In certain embodiments, the mother liquor is returned to the source of feedwater for the methods of invention, e.g., an ocean or sea. Alternatively, the mother liquor may be further processed, e.g., subjected to desalination protocols, as described further in U.S. application Ser. No. 12/163,205, filed Jun. 27, 2008, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,744,761; the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in the present disclosure. The resultant dewatered precipitate is then dried to produce the carbonate composition of the invention, as illustrated at step 1304 of FIG. 13. Drying can be achieved by air drying the precipitate. Where the precipitate is air dried, air drying may be at a temperature ranging from −70 to 120° C., as desired. In certain embodiments, drying is achieved by freeze-drying (i.e., lyophilization), where the precipitate is frozen, the surrounding pressure is reduced and enough heat is added to allow the frozen water in the material to sublime directly from the frozen precipitate phase to gas. In yet another embodiment, the precipitate is spray dried to dry the precipitate, where the liquid containing the precipitate is dried by feeding it through a hot gas (such as the gaseous waste stream from the power plant), e.g., where the liquid feed is pumped through an atomizer into a main drying chamber and a hot gas is passed as a co-current or counter-current to the atomizer direction. Depending on the particular drying protocol of the system, the drying station may include a filtration element, freeze drying structure, spray drying structure, etc. The drying step may discharge air and fines 1306. In some embodiments, the step of spray drying may include separation of different sized particles of the precipitate. Where desired, the dewatered precipitate product from 1302 may be washed before drying, as illustrated at step 1303 of FIG. 13. The precipitate may be washed with freshwater, e.g., to remove salts (such as NaCl) from the dewatered precipitate. Used wash water may be disposed of as convenient, e.g., by disposing of it in a tailings pond, etc. The water used for washing may contain metals, such as, iron, nickel, etc. In some embodiments, the dried precipitate is refined, milled, aged, and/or cured (as shown in the refining step 1305), e.g., to provide for desired physical characteristics, such as particle size, surface area, zeta potential, etc., or to add one or more components to the precipitate, such as admixtures, aggregate, supplementary cementitious materials, etc., to produce the carbonate composition. Refinement may include a variety of different protocols. In certain embodiments, the product is subjected to mechanical refinement, e.g., grinding, in order to obtain a product with desired physical properties, e.g., particle size, etc. The dried precipitate may be milled or ground to obtain a desired particle size. In some embodiments, the calcium carbonate precipitate formed by the methods and system of the invention, is in a metastable form including but not limited to, vaterite, aragonite, amorphous calcium carbonate, or combination thereof. In some embodiments, the calcium carbonate precipitate formed by the methods and system of the invention, is in a metastable form including but not limited to, vaterite, amorphous calcium carbonate, or combination thereof. The vaterite containing composition of calcium carbonate, after coming into contact with water converts to a stable polymorph form such as aragonite, calcite, or combination thereof with a high compressive strength. The carbonate composition or the cementitous composition, thus formed, has elements or markers that originate from the carbon from the source of carbon used in the process. The carbonate composition after setting, and hardening has a compressive strength of at least 14 MPa; or at least 16 MPa; or at least 18 MPa; or at least 20 MPa; or at least 25 MPa; or at least 30 MPa; or at least 35 MPa; or at least 40 MPa; or at least 45 MPa; or at least 50 MPa; or at least 55 MPa; or at least 60 MPa; or at least 65 MPa; or at least 70 MPa; or at least 75 MPa; or at least 80 MPa; or at least 85 MPa; or at least 90 MPa; or at least 95 MPa; or at least 100 MPa; or from 14-100 MPa; or from 14-80 MPa; or from 14-75 MPa; or from 14-70 MPa; or from 14-65 MPa; or from 14-60 MPa; or from 14-55 MPa; or from 14-50 MPa; or from 14-45 MPa; or from 14-40 MPa; or from 14-35 MPa; or from 14-30 MPa; or from 14-25 MPa; or from 14-20 MPa; or from 14-18 MPa; or from 14-16 MPa; or from 17-35 MPa; or from 17-30 MPa; or from 17-25 MPa; or from 17-20 MPa; or from 17-18 MPa; or from 20-100 MPa; or from 20-90 MPa; or from 20-80 MPa; or from 20-75 MPa; or from 20-70 MPa; or from 20-65 MPa; or from 20-60 MPa; or from 20-55 MPa; or from 20-50 MPa; or from 20-45 MPa; or from 20-40 MPa; or from 20-35 MPa; or from 20-30 MPa; or from 20-25 MPa; or from 30-100 MPa; or from 30-90 MPa; or from 30-80 MPa; or from 30-75 MPa; or from 30-70 MPa; or from 30-65 MPa; or from 30-60 MPa; or from 30-55 MPa; or from 30-50 MPa; or from 30-45 MPa; or from 30-40 MPa; or from 30-35 MPa; or from 40-100 MPa; or from 40-90 MPa; or from 40-80 MPa; or from 40-75 MPa; or from 40-70 MPa; or from 40-65 MPa; or from 40-60 MPa; or from 40-55 MPa; or from 40-50 MPa; or from 40-45 MPa; or from 50-100 MPa; or from 50-90 MPa; or from 50-80 MPa; or from 50-75 MPa; or from 50-70 MPa; or from 50-65 MPa; or from 50-60 MPa; or from 50-55 MPa; or from 60-100 MPa; or from 60-90 MPa; or from 60-80 MPa; or from 60-75 MPa; or from 60-70 MPa; or from 60-65 MPa; or from 70-100 MPa; or from 70-90 MPa; or from 70-80 MPa; or from 70-75 MPa; or from 80-100 MPa; or from 80-90 MPa; or from 80-85 MPa; or from 90-100 MPa; or from 90-95 MPa; or 14 MPa; or 16 MPa; or 18 MPa; or 20 MPa; or 25 MPa; or 30 MPa; or 35 MPa; or 40 MPa; or 45 MPa. For example, in some embodiments of the foregoing aspects and the foregoing embodiments, the composition after setting, and hardening has a compressive strength of 14 MPa to 40 MPa; or 17 MPa to 40 MPa; or 20 MPa to 40 MPa; or 30 MPa to 40 MPa; or 35 MPa to 40 MPa. In some embodiments, the compressive strengths described herein are the compressive strengths after 1 day, or 3 days, or 7 days, or 28 days. The precipitates, comprising, e.g., calcium and magnesium carbonates and bicarbonates in some embodiments may be utilized as building materials, e.g., as cements and aggregates, as described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/126,776, filed on 23 May 2008, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,735,274 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety in the present disclosure. The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the present invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention nor are they intended to represent that the experiments below are all or the only experiments performed. Various modifications of the invention in addition to those described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and accompanying figures. Such modifications fall within the scope of the appended claims. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers used (e.g. amounts, temperature, etc.) but some experimental errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, molecular weight is weight average molecular weight, temperature is in degrees Centigrade, and pressure is at or near atmospheric. In the examples and elsewhere, abbreviations have the following meanings: AEM = anion exchange membrane Ag = silver Ag/AgCl = silver/silver chloride cm2 = centimeter square ClEtOH = chloroethanol CV = cyclic voltammetry DI = deionized EDC = ethylene dichloride g = gram HCl = hydrochloric acid hr = hour Hz = hertz M = molar mA = milliamps mA/cm2 = milliamps/centimeter square mg = milligram min. = minute mmol = millimole mol = mole μl = microliter μm = micrometer mL = milliliter ml/min = milliliter/minute mV = millivolt mV/s or mVs−1 = millivolt/second NaCl = sodium chloride NaOH = sodium hydroxide nm = nanometer Ωcm2 = ohms centimeter square Pd/C = palladium/carbon Pt = platinum PtIr = platinum iridium rpm = revolutions per minute STY = space time yield V = voltage w/v = weight/volume w/w = weight/weight EXAMPLES Example 1 This example illustrates an experimental set up and proposed experimental conditions for a half cell reaction. The reaction is carried out in the experimental set up illustrated in FIG. 14. Cyclic voltammetry is performed on metal-salt anolytes (tin (ii) chloride, chromium (II) chloride, iron (II) chloride, and copper (I) chloride). Example 2 Voltage Savings with CO2 in the Catholyte This example illustrates the highest current density achieved at 0V in different electrochemical systems. The conditions used for this experiment were: anode: 6 cm2 Pt foil; cathode: 6 cm2 oxygen depolarized cathode; anolyte: 0.5M Cr2+ solvated with ultrapure deionized water; brine: 15.6 wt % NaCl solvated with ultrapure deionized water; catholyte: 10 wt % NaOH solvated with ultrapure deionized water. Solution temperatures were held constant at 70° C. and re-circulated in the cell at 400 rpm using an LS16 sized peristaltic tubing. The electrochemical systems used in this experiment were the electrochemical system 500 of FIG. 5A but with 2-compartment system where only one ion exchange membrane was used (System A in FIG. 15); the electrochemical system 500 of FIG. 5A with 2-compartment system and where CO2 was administered to the catholyte (System B in FIG. 15); the electrochemical system 500 of FIG. 5A with 3-compartment system (System C in FIG. 15); and the electrochemical system 500 of FIG. 5A with 3-compartment system and where CO2 was administered to the catholyte (System D in FIG. 15). The catholyte was bubbled with CO2 until the pH reached less than 12 and around 10. As illustrated in FIG. 15, adjusting the pH of the catholyte via CO2 injection improved the overall performance as higher current density was achieved at 0V. Also, removing a compartment and cation exchange membrane for the 2-compartment improved results over the 3-compartment system. It is contemplated that there are a reduction of ohmic losses from the membrane and the electrolyte. Example 3 Voltage Savings with CO2 in the Catholyte This example illustrates the highest current density achieved at 0V in different electrochemical systems. The conditions used for this experiment were: anode: 6 cm2 Pt foil; cathode: 6 cm2 Pt foil; anolyte: 0.5M Cr2+ solvated with ultrapure deionized water; brine: 15.6 wt % NaCl solvated with ultrapure deionized water; catholyte: 10 wt % NaOH solvated with ultrapure deionized water. Solution temperatures were held constant at 70° C. and re-circulated in the cell at 400 rpm using an LS16 sized peristaltic tubing. The electrochemical systems used in this experiment were the electrochemical system 400 of FIG. 4A but with 2-compartment system where only one ion exchange membrane was used (System E in FIG. 16); and the electrochemical system 400 of FIG. 4A with 2-compartment system and where CO2 was administered to the catholyte (System F in FIG. 16). It is to be understood that a similar experiment can be set-up for 3-compartment system, as described in Example 2. The catholyte was bubbled with CO2 until the pH reached less than 12 and around 10. As illustrated in FIG. 16, adjusting the pH of the catholyte via CO2 injection improved the overall performance as it improved the voltage by 300 mV at 150 mA/cm2. Here the cathode reaction produced hydrogen that can be used for metal ion regeneration through the use of hydrogenation (as illustrated in FIG. 6). For this test, the current was increased galvanostatically and the resulting cell voltage was recorded. Example 4 Treatment of Metal with Hydrogen Gas Experiment 1: Hydrogenation of Chromium This example illustrates the hydrogenation of the chromium ion in the higher oxidation state to form the chromium ion in the lower oxidation state and hydrochloric acid. FIG. 17A is an illustration of electrochemical cyclic voltammograms to detect the presence of Cr2+ after reducing a 0.46M solution of Cr3+ with hydrogen at 25° C. for 8 hrs. Two standard solutions of 0.46M Cr2+ and 0.46M Cr3+ were prepared and characterized electrochemically. The conditions used for this experiment were: anode: 6 cm2 Pt foil; cathode: 6 cm2 Pt foil; anolyte: 0.46M Cr2+, 0.46M Cr3+, and reduced solution containing Cr3+ and Cr2+ solvated with ultrapure deionized water. Solution temperatures were held constant at 70°. The voltage was scanned from 0 to 0.8V vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode at 10 mV/s. It was expected to see Cr2+ oxidation with no oxidation signals for the Cr3+ standard in this voltage range. Since an oxidation peak for Cr2+ standard was seen, the solution that had been reduced from Cr3+ to Cr2+ was tested using cyclic voltammetry. As illustrated in FIG. 17A, the reduced sample showed the presence of Cr2+ indicating a reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ via hydrogenation. Experiment 2: Hydrogenation of Copper This example illustrates the hydrogenation of the copper ion in the higher oxidation state to form the copper ion in the lower oxidation state and hydrochloric acid. To a 1-necked 100 ml round bottom flask, was added 100 ml of DI water. Using a t-necked gas inlet adapter, the water was aspirated and filled 5× with nitrogen. To this oxygen free water was then added 1.7 g (0.01 mol) of CuCl2.2H2O (0.1M in CuCl2.2H2O) and magnetic stir bar. To the resulting light blue liquid, was added 300 mg of 1% Pd/C and the mix was rapidly stirred under nitrogen. The mixture was then aspirated 4× with H2 gas from a rubber bladder and finally kept under positive H2 pressure stirring rapidly. After 12 h the stirrer was stopped and a ˜2 mL aliquot was removed and filtered through a 0.2 μm filter disk using a 5 ml syringe. The resulting filtrate was clear. As illustrated in FIG. 17B, the UV-VIS showed ˜94% conversion of Cu(II) to Cu(I) (top curve is for Cu(II) before reaction and bottom curve is for Cu(II) after reaction) with a notably acidic solution (showing the formation of HCl). Example 5 Formation of Halohydrocarbon from Unsaturated Hydrocarbon Formation of EDC from Ethylene Using Copper Chloride Experiment 1: This experiment is directed to the formation of ethylene dichloride (EDC) from ethylene using cupric chloride. The experiment was conducted in a pressure vessel. The pressure vessel contained an outer jacket containing the catalyst, i.e. cupric chloride solution and an inlet for bubbling ethylene gas in the cupric chloride solution. The catalyst solution used in the experiment was 200 mL of 1M NaCl, 1M CuCl2, and 0.5 mL of 12.1M HCl. This solution was clear and green. The pressure vessel was heated to 160° C. and ethylene gas was passed into the vessel for up to 300 psi for 30 minutes. The solution after reaction was found to be much darker than the starting solution. The product formed in the solution was extracted with 50 mL pentane and was then separated using a separatory funnel. The pentane extract containing the EDC was subjected to gas-chromatography (GC). FIG. 18 illustrates a peak at the retention time for EDC. The other small peaks pertain to pentane. FIG. 19 shows that the CV of a pre-reaction catalyst solution was flat and the CV of a post-reaction solution showed oxidation at 0.4V (for the half cell and the reference electrode). The UV-Vis of the product gave a Cu2+ concentration of 0.973M. Experiment 2: This experiment is directed to the formation of ethylene dichloride (EDC) from ethylene using cupric chloride. The experiment was conducted in a pressure vessel. The pressure vessel contained an outer jacket containing the catalyst, i.e. cupric chloride solution and an inlet for bubbling ethylene gas in the cupric chloride solution. The concentration of the reactants was, as shown in Table II below. The pressure vessel was heated to 160° C. and ethylene gas was passed into the vessel containing 200 mL of the solution at 300 psi for between 30 min.-1 hr in the experiments. The vessel was cooled to 4° C. before venting and opening. The product formed in the solution was extracted with ethyl acetate and was then separated using a reparatory funnel. The ethyl acetate extract containing the EDC was subjected to gas-chromatography (GC).

The experiment was conducted in a pressure vessel. The pressure vessel contained an outer jacket containing the catalyst, i.e. cupric chloride solution and an inlet for bubbling propylene gas in the cupric chloride solution. A 150 mL solution of 5M CuCl2, 0.5M CuCl, 1M NaCl, and 0.03M HCl was placed into a glass-lined 450 mL stirred pressure vessel. After purging the closed container with N2, it was heated to 160° C. After reaching this temperature, propylene was added to the container to raise the pressure from the autogenous pressure, mostly owing from water vapor, to a pressure of 130 psig. After 15 minutes, more propylene was added to raise the pressure from 120 psig to 140 psig. After an additional 15 minutes, the pressure was 135 psig. At this time, the reactor was cooled to 14° C., depressurized, and opened. Ethyl acetate was used to rinse the reactor parts and then was used as the extraction solvent. The product was analyzed by gas chromatography which showed 0.203 g of 1,2-dichloropropane that was recovered in the ethyl acetate phase. Example 6 Use of Ligand In regards to studying a ligated copper system, a sample was made using the ligand N,N,N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). TMEDA= N,N,N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine Various other examples for the ligand are illustrated in FIG. 20 which have been described herein. Any of the ligands illustrated in FIG. 20 can be used in the catalytic reactions of the invention. Other examples of the ligands are also illustrated in Example 10. The aqueous solution consisted of the following: 2.5M NaCl, 1.0M CuCl2, 0.5M CuCl, and 2.2M TMEDA. Upon mixing the ligand with the rest of the solution, a brownish solution changed quickly to a dark blue solution indicating ligation had occurred. The treatment of the above solution (diluted) with dichloromethane followed by vigorous shaking showed that after phase separation, the complex was not pulled into the extraction solvent. This effect is desirable since this can reduce metal complex contamination when an extraction method is used for isolation of organic products from the metal ions. The pH of the solution changed from acidic to mildly basic (pH 2.6 to 7.8) upon addition of the ligand. This effect of the ligand on the pH can be a benefit to reducing the corrosive nature of the copper chloride catalyst system. Example 7 Voltage Savings with the Ligand A half cell reaction was carried out using the metal-ligand solution of Example 6 and the set up of Example 1. The working electrode for the half cell reaction was 4 cm2 Pt Gauze 52 mesh anode; the counter electrode was 6 cm2 Pt foil; and the reference electrode was Saturated Calomel electrode (SCE). The solution in the beaker was kept at 70° C. In one experiment, a solution contained 2.5M NaCl, 1.0M CuCl2, and 0.5M CuCl and no ligand. In the other experiment, the solution contained 2.5M NaCl, 1.0M CuCl2, 0.5M CuCl, and 2.2M TMEDA (Example 6). As illustrated in FIG. 21, a voltage savings of about 200 mV was observed at 150 mA/cm2 when the ligand was used in the metal solution. Example 8 Voltage Savings with the Ligand A full cell reaction was carried out using the metal-ligand solution of Example 6 and the cell of FIG. 4A. The components of the cell were commercially available and included Pt guaze anode; fine Ni mesh cathode; anion exchange membrane as AHA; and the cation exchange membrane as 2100. The catholyte was 10 wt % NaOH. In 1st experiment, the anolyte was 2.5M NaCl, 1.0M CuCl2, and 0.5M CuCl and no ligand and in the 2nd experiment, the anolyte was 2.5M NaCl, 1.0M CuCl2, 0.5M CuCl, and 2.2M TMEDA (Example 6). FIG. 22 illustrates that the presence of the ligand reduced the redox potential (about 300 mV in this experiment) which resulted in the decrease in the cell voltage. The color of the ligand solution also changed dramatically which could be due to oxidation of Cu+ to Cu2+. Example 9 Anion Exchange Membrane This example illustrates effect of selection of AEM on the prevention of the crossover of the metal ions through the AEM to the middle chamber. This example also illustrates the selection of AEM that prevents crossover of metal ions, fouling of the membrane, and increase in resistance. Direct Current Method A series of anion exchange membranes were tested in this experiment including ACS, ACM and AHA from Astom Corporation, FAB and FAP from FuMaTech, and DSV from Asahi Glass. The AEM was sandwiched in between an anolyte containing 3M CuCl2/1M CuCl/4.6M NaCl and a chamber containing 4.6M NaCl electrolyte. A standard three-electrode setup was used including a platinum gauze working/counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) reference. An additional two SCE's were placed in a luggin capillary on either side of the membrane. Small current steps of 1, 2, 4, 5, 7.5, 10, and 11 mA/cm2 were applied and a multimeter was used to monitor the change in potential between the two SCEs. The slope of the current density vs voltage change equals the through plane area resistance. The results are illustrated in FIG. 23. The resistance values in FIG. 23 include the AEM and solution resistance. ACS, ACM, and FAB showed the highest resistance. It is contemplated that these AEMs have been designed for enhanced proton blocking and require a highly acidic medium for proper function. FAP, DSV, and AHA had a reduction of over 5 Ωcm2. FAP and DSV showed significant signs of permeation of Cu-base species. AHA was found to be most effective against crossover and was found to have least resistance. Impedance Spectroscopy Method In this experiment, a two Pt-foil electrode setup was used. The AHA membrane was sandwiched in between a saturated brine solution and the Cu-base electrolyte. The frequency range was between 15,000 Hz-0.001 Hz at an amplitude of 20 mA and a DC signal of 150 mA/cm2. The cell was run with and without the AHA and the difference in high frequency x-intercepts represented the AEM area resistance. The AHA resistance in three different Cu-base electrolytes is summarized in Table III. Solution A is: 4.6M NaCl: solution B is: 0.5M CuCl/2.5M NaCl; solution C is: 4.5M CuCl2/0.5M CuCl/2.5M NaCl; and solution D is: 4.5M CuCl2/0.5M CuCl. TABLE III Summary of results for resistance measurements of AHA in different Cu-base solutions Ωcm2 Ωcm2 AHA + V loss @ Chemistry solution solution Ωcm2 AHA 150 mA/cm2 A-membrane-A 1.28 3.14 1.86 0.28 A-membrane-B 1.28/1.77 3.58 1.81-2.06 0.272-0.308 A-membrane-C 1.28/2.8 4.96 2.16-2.92 0.324-0.438 A-membrane-D 1.28/3.14 7.51 4.37-5.3 0.656-0.795 It was observed that solution B with no CuCl2 had a resistance similar to plain NaCl with no added CuClx. Solution C showed a voltage loss between 320-430 mV. Adding CuCl2 into the anolyte produced a small increase in resistance. It is contemplated that this could be due to the change in solution resistance through the AEM. Solution D, which is equivalent to solution C with no NaCl, showed over a 2-fold increase in voltage loss. It is contemplated that there may be a change in copper speciation leading to an increase in resistance. Permeability or Crossover of Cu-Chloride Complexes A full cell configuration was used to measure the Cu-species transport through the AEM. A solution of 4.5M CuCl2/0.5M CuCl/2.5M NaCl was fed into the anolyte, 4.6M NaCl was fed into the intermediate compartment, and 10 wt % NaOH was fed into the catholyte at 70° C. The cell was operated at 150 mA/cm2 and 300 mA/cm2 at a series of flow rates. For each flow rate (such as 20 ml/min, 40 mL/min, etc.) the copper ion concentration was measured pre testing and after running the cell for 30 min. UV-VIS was used to measure the total Cu in the brine solution in the intermediate compartment, pre and post testing. This value was then compared to the number of faradaic moles passed to obtain a percent rejection. The results are summarized in FIG. 24. As illustrated in FIG. 24, the AHA membrane provided >99%+/−0.01% rejection of all Cu-species in all cases. Example 10 Use of a Ligand To a 4 mL screw cap glass vial, containing a stir bar, was added 49 mg of CuCl (0.5 mmol). To this solution, the ligand together with 100 μl water was added and the reaction mixture was allowed to react for 2-3 hours at room temperature. Next a 2 mL aqueous stock solution of 6M CuCl2 and 1M NaCl, which was heated for complete dissolution, was added. The vial was capped with a pre-slit septa made out of TEF and silicone. The vial was placed in a clam shell pressure reactor on top of a stirring hot plate. The atmosphere inside the reactor was exchanged to N2. The stirring was started at 620 rpm and the reactor was heated to 140° C. After reaching temperature, the reactor with multiple vials inside was pressurized to 350 psi total pressure. After 1 hour, the reactor was cooled to below 30° C. and slowly vented. The reaction mixture was extracted with 1 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was analyzed by GC (gas chromatography) for ethylene dichloride and chloroethanol (ClEtOH) content. FIG. 25A and Table IV illustrate the specific ligand, the amount of the ligand, the reaction conditions, and the amount of main products formed. A comparative example without ligand is included as well. FIG. 25B illustrates other examples of the ligands that can be used in the catalytic reaction. Table IV demonstrates that the ligand not only improves the yield of EDC in the reaction but also improves the selectivity.

The working electrode for the half cell reaction was 6 cm2 Par 152-mesh gauze; the counter electrode was 8 cm2 Pt foil; and the reference electrode was standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) Ag/AgCl. The solution in the beaker was kept at 70° C. In the experiment, a solution contained 1M FeCl2 and 2.5M NaCl. As illustrated in FIG. 26, oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ at the anode was observed at voltage scan rate of 5 mV/s. Example 12 Electrolytes in Electrochemical Cell A full cell reaction was carried out using sodium chloride and ammonium chloride as electrolytes. The components of the cell were commercially available and included Pt guaze anode; PGM mesh cathode; anion exchange membrane as AHA from Neosepta; and the cation exchange membrane as Dupont N2100. The catholyte was 10 wt % NaOH. In 1st experiment, the anolyte was 4.5M CuCl2/0.5M CuCl/2.5M NaCl and in the 2nd experiment, the anolyte was 4.5M CuCl2/0.5M CuCl/2.5M NH4Cl. The solution in the cell was kept at 70° C. FIG. 27 illustrates that although both sodium chloride and ammonium chloride electrolytes work well in the electrochemical cell, the NH4Cl anolyte lowered the operating cell voltage by 200-250 mV at 300 mA/cm2. It is contemplated that it may be due to the increased conductivity of the anolyte which resulted in a lower resistance across the AEM. Example 13 AEM Conditioning at the Start-Up of the Electrochemical Cell This experiment was related to the conditioning of the AEM before the start of the electrochemical cell. Initial solutions introduced into the full cell were 0.5M Na2SO4 as the anolyte, 4.6M NaCl into the intermediate compartment, and 10 wt % NaOH as the catholyte. The membranes were FAS from FuMaTech as the anion exchange membrane and N2100 from Dupont as the cation exchange membrane. The cell was then run at 300 mA/cm2. At this point, the anodic reaction was oxygen evolution and the cathodic reaction was water reduction. As illustrated in FIG. 28, the initial overall cell voltage of about 4.5V was seen. Once the voltage was stabilized, a valve was switched and the Na2SO4 was flushed out of the cell and the anolyte (4.5M CuCl2/0.5M CuCl/2.5M NaCl) was then fed into the anode chamber. The cell was constantly held at 300 mA/cm2 during this time. The anodic reaction now was copper oxidation, as illustrated in FIG. 28 as the sudden drop in cell voltage. The black curve shows the voltage when the copper electrolyte was introduced into the cell (with no initial voltage stabilization by sodium sulfate) before a voltage was applied. There was about a 200 mV voltage savings when Na2SO4 was used at the start-up and the voltage was significantly more stable for the duration of the test. The conditioning of the AEM at the operating current density prior to introducing the copper-base electrolyte may be beneficial for voltage and stability. Example 14 Re-Circulation of Aqueous Phase from Catalytic Reactor to Electrochemical System This example illustrates the re-circulation of the Cu(I) solution generated by a catalysis reactor to the electrochemical cell containing a Par gauze electrode. A solution containing 4.5M Cu(II), 0.1M Cu(I), and 1.0M NaCl was charged to the Parr bomb reactor for a 60 min. reaction at 160° C. and 330 psi. The same solution was tested via anodic cyclic voltammetry (CV) before and after the catalysis run to look for effects of organic residues such as EDC or residual extractant on anode performance. Each CV experiment was conducted at 70° C. with 10 mVs−1 scan rate for five cycles, 0.3 to 0.8V vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE). FIG. 29 illustrates the resulting V/I response of a Par gauze electrode (6 cm2) in solutions before and after catalysis (labeled pre and post, respectively). As illustrated in FIG. 29, redox potential (voltage at zero current) shifted to lower voltages post-catalysis as expected from the Nernst equation for an increase in Cu(I) concentration. The increase in the Cu(I) concentration was due to EDC production with Cu(1) regeneration during a catalysis reaction. The pre-catalysis CV curve reached a limiting current near 0.5 A due to mass transfer limitations at low Cu(I) concentration. The Cu(I) generation during the catalysis run was signified by a marked improvement in kinetic behavior post-catalysis, illustrated in FIG. 29 as a steeper and linear IN slope with no limiting current reached. No negative effects of residual EDC or other organics were apparent as indicated by the typical reversible I/V curve obtained in the post-catalysis CV. Example 15 Re-Circulation of Aqueous Phase from Catalytic Reactor Containing Ligand This example illustrates the re-circulation of the Cu(I) solution containing the ligand from the catalysis reactor to the electrochemical cell. A 2 mL sample of the catalyst solution tested in the catalysis high throughput reactor was sent to a three-electrode micro-cell for electrochemical screening via anodic cyclic voltammetry (CV) to determine if a correlation existed between redox potential and catalysis performance. The ligands were: Ligand #1= and Ligand #2= The catalyst solution contained 5.0M Cu(II)/0.5M Cu(I)/0.5M or 1M ligand/1M NaCl. These ligand solutions were tested in the anodic micro-half-cell via cyclic voltammetry to measure redox potential. The micro-cell consisted of a Par foil working electrode, Pt foil counter electrode, and a capillary bridge to a Ag/AgCl microelectrode as reference. All electrodes were sealed into a 4 mL vial, heated to 70° C. and stirred at 100 rpm. Each CV experiment was conducted at 70° C. with 10 mV s−1 scan rate for five cycles, 0.3 to 0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Table V below shows the voltages obtained for five catalytic re-circulated solutions. The results indicated that ligand enhanced the EDC production and the re-circulated catalytic solution containing the ligand to the electrochemical cell, reduced the electrochemical voltage. Table V shows that the redox potential of samples containing ligand #1 (samples A and B) had a reduced redox potential compared to the equivalent ligand free system E. Samples C and D that contained the ligand #2 had a similar redox potential compared to the ligand free sample E.
