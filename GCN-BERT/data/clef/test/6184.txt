The present invention relates to oligomers containing ethylenically unsaturated groups and further containing polymer stabilizer groups. The polymer stabilizers are for example selected from the group consisting of hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS), ultraviolet light absorbers (UVAs), antioxidants and dihyrocarbylhydroxylamines. It has been found that certain polymer stabilizers, when covalently bound to certain curable oligomers, perform exceptionally well in curable compositions. The bound stabilizers are highly compatible. The ethylenically unsaturated groups and the polymer stabilizers are bound to the oligomer through allophanate and/or carbamate groups. Accordingly, the present invention is aimed at oligomer compounds containing ethylenically unsaturated groups bound through allophanate groups and/or carbamate groups and containing one or more polymer stabilizer groups bound through allophanate groups and/or carbamate groups. The present oligomer compounds are derived from a) organic polyisocyanates, b) compounds containing at least one isocyanate reactive group and at least one ethylenically unsaturated group and c) compounds containing at least one isocyanate reactive group and at least one polymer stabilizer group. The process for preparing the present oligomer compounds comprises reacting a) at least one organic polyisocyanate with b) at least one compound containing at least one isocyanate reactive group and at least one ethylenically unsaturated group to prepare an intermediate with allophanate bound ethylenically unsaturated groups and unreacted isocyanate groups, followed by reacting the intermediate with c) at least one compound containing at least one isocyanate reactive group and at least one polymer stabilizer group. The order in the above 2 step process may also be reversed. In this case a) would be reacted first with c) to prepare an intermediate, followed by reacting the intermediate with b). In this case the intermediate would contain allophanate bound polymer stabilizer groups and unreacted isocyanate groups. Alternatively, the present process comprises reacting a) at least one polyisocyanate, b) at least one compound comprising at least one isocyanate reactive group and at least one ethylenically unsaturated group and c) at least one compound containing at least one isocyanate reactive group and at least one polymer stabilizer group in a 1 step process without the preparation of any intermediate. In the 2 step processes, an intermediate containing allophanate groups is formed. This intermediate may be isolated. The intermediate containing allophanate groups contains at least 1 unreacted isocyanate group. The intermediate advantageously contains 2, 3 or 4 isocyanate groups, normally 2. The number average molecular weight, Mn, of the present oligomers is less than 10,000 g/mol, preferably less than 5000 g/mol, more preferably less than 4000 g/mol and most preferably is 2000 g/mol or less. Preferably the number average molecular weight is from about 900 to about 3000 g/mol, more preferably from about 1000 to about 2500 g/mol and most preferably from about 1000 to about 2000 g/mol. The term “derived from” means that oligomer contains these groups as monomer units or end groups. The amount of allophanate groups, C2N2HO3, in the oligomers is generally from about 3% to about 25% by weight. The present general process may follow those taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,739,251 and 6,617,413 and U.S. application Ser. No. 13/905,514, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The processes of this invention may employ necessary catalysts and temperature ranges as described therein. The present process may be performed neat, or may be performed with a suitable solvent. Suitable solvents include acetone, isobutyl methyl ketone, toluene, xylene, butyl acetate, methoxypropyl acetate, ethoxyethyl acetate and ethyl acetate. A suitable catalyst may be employed, for instance metal compounds, amine compounds or ammonium compounds, for example zinc acetylacetonate, zinc 2-ethylcaproate, di-n-butyltindilaurate, zinc octoate, tin(II) octoate, triethylamine, dimethyl ethanolamine, N,N,N-trimethyl-N-2-hydroxypropylammonium hydroxide or N, N, N-trimethyl-N-2-hydroxypropylammonium 2-ethyl hexanoate. Temperatures of from about 30° C. to about 200° C. or to about 160° C. are generally employed for allophanate and carbamate formation. The oligomers of this invention may be visualized as one of the following structures: The number of allophanate groups is generally 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. The end groups may also be unreacted isocyanate groups. The groups n1 and n2 represent repeating units of 1 and above and may also be zero. The groups n1 and n2 are not both zero. The present oligomer compounds include at least one stabilizer moiety and at least one ethylenically unsaturated group. The groups n1 and n2 may be random or block. It is not necessary that all isocyante groups be converted to allophanate or carbamate groups. The final polyallophanate oligomer products may contain residual isocyanate groups. The present oligomers may contain some groups other than allophanate, carbamate and/or isocyanate groups. Such groups would normally be in minor amounts and are other possible reaction products of isocyanate groups. For example, the present oligomers may contain residual isocyanate groups or may contain less than 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 or less than 0.1% by weight of free isocyanate groups by weight. When isocyanate groups are present, the oligomers are useful in dual cure systems, with both curable isocyanate groups and curable ethylenically unsaturated groups. Oligomers containing residual isocyanate groups contain for example 1 or 2 isocyanate groups. The polyisocyanates are preferably diisocyanates having 4 to 20 C atoms. Examples are tetramethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate (1,6-diisocyanatohexane), octamethylene diisocyanate, decamethylene diisocyanate, dodecamethylene diisocyanate, tetradecamethylene diisocyanate, derivatives of lysine diisocyanate, tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate, trimethylhexane diisocyanate or tetramethylhexane diisocyanate, cycloaliphatic diisocyanates such as 1,4-, 1,3- or 1,2-diisocyanatocyclohexane, 4,4′- or 2,4′-di(isocyanatocyclohexyl)methane, 1-isocyanato-3,3,5-trimethyl-5-(isocyanatomethyl)cyclohexane (isophorone diisocyanate), 1,3- or 1,4-bis(isocyanatomethyl)cyclohexane or 2,4- or 2,6-diisocyanato-1-methylcyclohexane, and also aromatic diisocyanates such as tolylene 2,4- or 2,6-diisocyanate and the isomer mixtures thereof, m- or p-xylylene diisocyanate, 2,4′- or 4,4′-diisocyanato-diphenylmethane and the isomer mixtures thereof, phenylene 1,3- or 1,4-diisocyanate, 1-chlorophenylene 2,4-diisocyanate, naphthylene 1,5-diisocyanate, diphenylene 4,4′-diisocyanate, 4,4′-diisocyanato-3,3′-dimethylbiphenyl, 3-methyldiphenylmethane 4,4′-diisocyanate, tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate, 1,4-diisocyanatobenzene or diphenyl ether 4,4′-diisocyanate.

This indicates that the instant oligomers are soluble and compatible which is highly desirable. The instant compounds can be easily polymerized into a polymer. EXAMPLE A2 Coating Cure A solution of 62.77 parts of an aliphatic urethane acrylate (LAROMER LR 8987), 6.30 parts of instant Example S4 (73.0 weight percent solids in ethyl acetate) and 5.28 parts of instant Example S6 (92.3 weight percent solids in ethyl acetate) is prepared.

EXAMPLE A3 Acrylate Bond Conversion A solution of 82.96 parts of an aliphatic urethane acrylate (LAROMER LR 8987), 7.50 parts of oligomer S4 (73.0 weight percent solids in ethyl acetate), 5.00 parts of oligomer S6 (92.3 weight percent solids in ethyl acetate), and 4.54 parts of a photoinitiator (IRGACURE 2022, 4.54% by weight) is prepared. This solution is coated using a bird bar onto a Leneta card with a wet film thickness of 2 microns and photocured using a Heraeus Noblelight Fusion UV systems Model DRS—10/12 QN, which is equipped with V & D lamps with adjustable power and conveyor settings.

This solution is coated using a bird bar onto a Leneta card with a wet film thickness of 2 microns and photocured using a Heraeus Noblelight Fusion UV systems Model DRS—10/12 QN, which is equipped with V & D lamps with adjustable power and conveyor settings. The films prepared from the formulation above are soaked in tetrahydrofuran (THF) for 24 hours. The per cent UV absorber retained is determined by measuring the UV absorbance of the film before and after THF extraction. Results are below. UV intensity is J/cm2. Conveyor speed is 46 ft/minute. UV intensity percent UV absorber retained 0 0 0.154 72.0 0.473 84.1 0.946 87.8 2.82 95.5 Very little of the UV absorber is removed by extraction when it is covalently bound to the resulting polymer backbone. Conversely, when UV6 itself is substituted for oligomer S4 in the formulation and the formulation is photocured in a similar fashion, over 90% of the UV absorber is removed by extraction. When the molecule is not covalently bound to the substrate, it can migrate out of the substrate and into the environment. The unbound molecule could migrate into a food stuff from a food package or food package label.
