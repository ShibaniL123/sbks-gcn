PIPERAQUINE MICROCAPSULES AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM REFERENCE TO PRIOR APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/804,448, filed March 22, 2013, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. BACKGROUND The most widely used dosage forms for oral administration include tablets and capsules. However, such dosage forms have several disadvantages. For example, it is estimated that 50% of the population have problems swallowing tablets. In particular, it is difficult for some elderly persons to swallow tablets or capsules or to medicate children who are unable or unwilling to swallow tablets or capsules. This leads to poor or non-compliance with the treatment, and thus has a negative impact on the efficacy of the treatment. The bitter taste of many actives precludes the medication from being easily sprinkled onto food, a commonly used method of administering medications to elderly and children. A number of methods are known for masking the taste of drugs; taste masking techniques may be divided into physical, chemical, biochemical and organoleptic methods. The technique to be adopted will depend on several factors, but primarily on the extent of bitterness of the drug to be incorporated into an oral pharmaceutical formulation. Organoleptic methods of taste-masking involve addition of a flavoring and/or sweetening agent and as such are relatively simple. However, simple addition of a taste-masking agent such as a flavoring agent or sweetener is frequently not useful by itself, unless the drug to be taste-masked is not particularly bitter. The most common masking methods, however, are based on physical means, including agglomeration, coating, and microencapsulation. Microencapsulation is essentially a process by which coatings are applied to small particles of solids, droplets of liquids or dispersions, so as to form microcapsules. The taste masked formulation of bitter drug-containing cores should allow the complete release of the drugs in the gastrointestinal tract within a suitable time period. For example, bitter drug-containing cores incorporated into chewable tablets typically have thick coatings of mostly water-insoluble polymers, to resist fracture during tablet compression and/or during chewing and concomitant leakage of the bitter active; however, in this case a substantially complete release of the drug from such chewable tablets in the gastrointestinal tract may be achieved only after several hours from administration. Among the drugs having a bitter taste there are the bisquinoline drugs. Bisquinoline derivatives are compounds with two quinoline groups bound by a covalent aliphatic or aromatic link. Several of these compounds have been identified as antimalarian medicaments and include hydroxypiperaquine, dichlorquinazine, 1,4 -bis (7-chloro-4-quinolylamino) piperazine, piperaqine. Bisquinolines includes free form of the compound and their pharmaceutically acceptable different forms, such as salts, solvates, esters, racemic form, enantiomers, diastereomers, metabolites, prodrugs, analogues, polymorphs, hydrates, hyper-hydrate. Particularly interesting is piperaquine (PQ) and piperaquine tetraphosphate tetrahydrate phosphate (PQP). PQP is the bisquinoline, 4,4’-(l,3-propanediyldi-4,lpiperazinediyl) bis(7-chloroquinoline) phosphate hydrate (1:4:4) or 7-chloro-4-[4-[3-[4-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)piperazin-l-yl]propyl]piperazin-l-yl]quinoline phosphoric acid, hydrate. Its molecular formula is: C 2 9 Η12 C12 Ν r, ■ 4 (Η 3 Ρ O 4) ■ 4 (Η 2 O), MW: 999.56. The molecular structure is: 4 H3PO4 - 4 h20 Any crystalline polymorphs and hydrates of PQ and PQP representing different solid state molecular forms of the same compound can be used in the present invention. Formulating piperaquine or piperaquine phosphate in their different forms is complicated by its bitter taste. Furthermore, PQP may induce chemical reactions on chemically reactive agents; instability and decomposition or degradation of chemically sensitive active agent such as dihydroartemisinin may occur when this agent is used in combination with PQP (Chem. Med. Chem., 2007, 1448-1463). Moreover, the formulation prepared with the bisquinoline drug should be controlled and customized both when PQP is used alone and in combination with other active agent(s). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a taste-masked microcapsule composition of a bisquinoline drug, wherein the microcapsule comprises a drug core and a coating (layer) of a polymeric material over the core and having the average coating weight of said microcapsule of from about 2 to about 40% weight of the total weight of the microcapsule composition. Particularly interesting is coacervated microcapsule composition comprising piperaquine or piperaquine phosphate and their pharmaceutically acceptable different forms, such as salts, solvates, or prodrugs thereof. The invention provides the pharmaceutical compositions comprising these microcapsule compositions with suitable drug content combined with a taste masking effect. The pharmaceutical compositions may be also used to form a stable combination product (combo product) of PQP microcapsules with at least one unstable or chemically sensitive active agent. Chemically sensitive or reactive agent has high chemical reactivity, it contains reactive moiety/ies, such as for example acetal groups, and easily undergoes degradation reactions, such as hydrolysis or dehydrogenation to form for example aldehyde/ketone and ring opening degradation products. The present invention also provides a process for preparing microcapsule composition of bisquinoline drug and the process for preparing pharmaceutical compositions comprising taste-masked microcapsule alone or in combination with other drug. The microcapsule preparation process includes the steps of: (a) forming a mixture comprising a bisquinoline drug, a polymeric material, and an organic solvent, (b) inducing the phase separation of the polymeric material from the solvent onto the drug, and (c) separating the drug microcapsule composition from the organic solvent. Microencapsulation of bisquinoline drug (PQ or PQP) in the different forms is carried out to mask the bad taste, to minimize discoloration upon light exposure. The microencapsulation disclosed in the present invention is also effective in preventing and minimizing the degradation of further highly reactive agent induced by PQP, when both active agent and drug are formulated in a combo dosage form.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION All documents cited herein are incorporated by reference for all purposes. As used herein, the term “microcapsules” refers to a drug core coated with polymeric material, that is the polymeric material forms a layer around the drug core. The term “coacervated microcapsules” refers to a drug core coated with polymeric material using the coacervation method. “Microencapsulation conducted by phase separation" and "coacervation" mean an encapsulation process in which the drug is dispersed in a solution containing a coating polymeric material, and procedures are then followed which result in deposition of the coating on the drug core, thus preparing “coacervated microcapsules”. As used herein, the term “coating weight” or “coating level” refers to the dry weight of the polymeric material divided by the weight of the entire microcapsule, multiplied by 100. For example, a coating weight of 15% w/w means that for the given microcapsule, the coating constitutes 15% of the weight of the microcapsule. As used herein, the term “average coating weight” refers to the mean value of the coating weight for a population of microcapsules. For example, if half of the microcapsules in a given population have a coating weight of 10% w/w and the other half has a coating weight of 20% w/w, the average coating weight for the given population of microcapsules is 15% w/w. All “coating weight” or “coating level” values given in the present text are “average coating weight”. The term "pharmaceutical formulation" as used herein refers to formulations containing the microcapsules of the invention in combination with carriers or excipients suited to a selected drug delivery dosage form. As used herein and unless otherwise specified, references to bisquinoline drug or piperaquine (PQ) or piperaquine phosphate (PQP) also encompasses a salt, solvate, or prodrug thereof; it is also intended for esters, racemic form, enantiomers, diastereomers, polymorphs, hydrates, or hyper-hydrate thereof. The present invention provides a taste-masked microcapsules composition of bisquinoline drug, where the microcapsule consists of a drug core and a coating (also called coating layer) of a polymeric material and wherein the average coating weight of said microcapsule is from about 2 to about 40% weight of the total weight of the microcapsule composition. The bisquinoline drug is selected from the group consisting of such as hydroxypiperaquine, dichlorquinazine, 1,4 -bis (7-chloro-4-quinolylamino) piperazine, piperaquine, piperaquine phosphate or pharmaceutically acceptable different forms, such as salts, solvates, hydrates, hyper-hydrate esters, metabolites, prodrugs, analogues, racemic form, enantiomers, diastereomers polymorphs thereof. In one embodiment of the present invention, the bisquinoline drug is piperaquine phosphate in any pharmaceutically acceptable different form. In one embodiment of the invention the bisquinoline is piperaquine tetraphosphate in hydrated form. The coating of polymeric material of the present invention is deposited over the drug core thus forming an uniform layer over the core. The polymeric material may be any suitable, pharmaceutically acceptable polymer that forms a coating around the drug particles, and thereby yields drug microcapsules exhibiting taste-masked properties. Examples of polymers which may be used in the present invention are selected from the group consisting of ethylcellulose, polyvinyl acetate cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, ammonium-methacrylate copolymers, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate butyrate, polymethacrylates, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, carboxymethyl ethylcellulose, polylactic acid and mixtures thereof. In the present invention the coating polymeric material is preferably insoluble in water. In one embodiment, the water-insoluble polymeric material of the invention is ethylcellulose. The amount and type of polymeric material in the coating contributes toward regulating the release of the drug and modulating the degree of taste masking. The average coating weight of the microcapsules of the present invention (also called coating level) is from about 2 to about 40% weight of the total weight of the microcapsule, or from about 5 to about 30% weight of the total weight of the microcapsule, or from about 10 to about 20% weight of the total weight of the microcapsule composition, including about 5% w/w, about 10% w/w, about 15% w/w, about 20% w/w, about 25% w/w, about 30% w/w, about 35% w/w, or about 40% w/w. The average coating weight of the microcapsules of the present invention is preferably from about 10% w/w to about 20% w/w. The microcapsules have an average coating weight of preferably about 10% w/w, or about 15% w/w, or about 20% w/w. The wettability of the water insoluble polymeric coating of the microcapsules may be improved by treatment of the microcapsules with surfactants. The taste masking of the coating is effective both on dry form and after suspension in water (60 seconds). The microcapsules have particles size distribution (PDS) in the range comprised between 180 and 400 microns, preferably between 200 and 300 pm. In one embodiment of the invention the taste-masked microcapsule composition consists of a drug core and a coating (layer) of a coacervated polymeric material. In one embodiment of the invention the taste-masked microcapsule compositions consists of piperaquine tetraphosphate tetrahydrate (PQP*4H20) core and a coating (layer) of coacervated ethylcellulose. In one embodiment of the invention the microcapsules of a bisquinoline (such as piperaquine tetraphosphate tetrahydrate) may be combined with additional active agent. The additional agent may be a drug that is not suitable to be used in pharmaceutical formulation because of its intrinsic chemical instability (such as agent sensitive to hydrolysis or that may undergo various degradation pathways) and / or also incompatible with many substances, including bisquinoline drugs (such as PQP). The microcapsule of bisquinoline drug (such as PQ or PQP) or any of its forms is effective in: masking the unpleasant taste of the drug; preventing /minimizing discoloration of the drug induced by light exposure; preparing stable combination with other unstable or chemically reactive active agents by preventing and minimizing the degradation induced by PQP. The characteristics of the produced microcapsules can be summarized: - optimal “in vitro” dissolution profile; - coating level uniform around the drug core and constant from batch to batch; - drug stability upon storage; - drug’s (PQ or PQP) physical properties such as crystalline structure are maintained after microencapsulation process; - light discoloration of the drug microencapsulated equivalent to that of starting drug; - particles size distribution (PDS) in the range comprised between 180 and 400 microns, preferably between 200 and 300 pm; - values of residual ingredients used in the preparation process (such as cyclohexane and phase inducer agent, PSI) always low and consistent with pharmaceutically allowable ranges. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may comprise taste-masked microcapsule composition of a bisquinoline drug and further inactive excipients. In another embodiment, the present invention provides a process for microcapsules preparation. The microcapsules of the present invention may be prepared by providing a homogeneous solution of a polymeric material in a suitable solvent in which the drug core and, optionally, coating additives are dispersed in suspension. Phase separation may then be applied to cause insolubilization of the polymeric material, which gels (coacervates) around the drug crystals to form the microcapsules. Phase separation may be performed, for example, through variation in temperature or in pH or by adding to the organic solvent a material promoting phase-separation (phase inducer agent) that cause the coacervation of the polymeric material. Finally, the microcapsules obtained are subjected to hardening, if required, and recovered. More specifically, the microencapsulation process used for the preparation of taste-masked microcapsules of the present invention comprises the following steps: (a) forming a mixture comprising a bisquinoline drug, a polymeric material, and an organic solvent, (b) inducing the phase separation of the polymeric material from the solvent onto the drug, and (c) separating the drug microcapsule composition from the organic solvent. In one embodiment the microencapsulation process comprises: (a) forming a mixture comprising a bisquinoline drug, a polymeric material, a material for promoting phase separation of the polymeric material, and an organic solvent, (b) inducing phase separation of the polymeric material from the solvent onto the drug, and (c) separating the drug microcapsules from said organic solvent. Hence, the microcapsules of the bisquinoline drug of the invention are prepared by first forming a mixture of the bisquinoline drug, a polymeric material (to serve as the coating), and a material for promoting phase separation of the polymeric material (phase inducer agent) and optionally further ingredients in an organic solvent. Mixing is preferably conducted along with stirring or agitation using any number of conventional means. The solvent should be one in which the polymeric materials are soluble at higher temperatures, i.e., temperatures generally on the order of 70°C or higher, but insoluble at ambient temperature; also, the drug should be substantially insoluble in the solvent at all temperatures used in the manufacturing process. After admixture of these initial components, the suspension so formed is heated for a time period and to a temperature sufficient to dissolve the first and second polymeric materials in the solvent. In addition, stirring is preferably continued at a predetermined stirring rate; a suitable stirring rate may be readily determined by one skilled in the art. The temperature is at or below the boiling point of the solvent; generally the components will be heated to a temperature of 70°C or higher, and preferably to a temperature of at least about 75°C. However, care must be taken not to heat to a temperature which could degrade the drug. Phase separation of the polymeric material from the solvent onto the drug core is induced by cooling at appropriate rate and to appropriate temperature, thus producing a dispersion of the drug microcapsule (microencapsulated drug). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the cooling rate can be varied to optimize properties of the microcapsules, e.g., with respect to aggregation, flowability and release profile. The solvent and phase inducer agent are then removed by decanting, filtering or the like, followed by washing with solvent to remove any traces of the phase inducer agent, and then drying, again at appropriate temperature so that the drug or coating material could be adversely affected. Drying is usually although not necessarily conducted for at least about 6 hours, and longer. Suitable phase inducer agents which may be used in the present invention include polyethylene, polyisobutylene, butyl rubber, polybutadiene, isoprene methacrylic polymers, organosilicon polymers such as polydimethyl siloxane, paraffin, etc. In one embodiment, the phase inducer agent is polyethylene (epolene). The organic solvent may be a single organic solvent or it may include a mixture of organic solvents. In accordance with the coacervation process, the organic solvent is chosen so as to dissolve the coating polymeric material, but not the drug and the possible coating additive(s) which remain dispersed in the form of solid particles in suspension. Suitable organic solvents include cyclohexane or other hydrocarbon solvents. In one embodiment, the organic solvent is cyclohexane. Suitable polymeric material include ethylcellulose, polyvinyl acetate, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate , ammonium-methacrylate copolymers, cellulose acetate phthalate, cellulose acetate butyrate, polymethacrylates, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, carboxymethyl ethylcellulose, polylactic acid and mixtures thereof. The optionally further ingredients may be a gastrosoluble pore former; this ingredient may be a gastrosoluble organic or inorganic pore-formers and may be selected from the group consisting of calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium saccharide, calcium succinate, calcium tartrate, ferric acetate, ferric hydroxide, ferric phosphate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium citrate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium phosphate and mixtures thereof.

The taste-masked composition of the invention may be also prepared by other methods. Core particles comprising a bisquinoline drug may be prepared followed by coating said core particles by applying a film forming polymer optionally in presence of other coating additives; this can be achieved for example by fluid bed. Said film forming polymer may be a single polymer or may be water-insoluble polymer in mixture with further ingredients, such as a gastrosoluble organic or inorganic pore-formers. The water-insoluble polymer may be selected from the group consisting of ethylcellulose, polyvinyl acetate, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, methacrylate copolymers and combinations thereof. The gastrosoluble pore former may be selected from the group consisting of calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, calcium saccharide, calcium succinate, calcium tartrate, ferric acetate, ferric hydroxide, ferric phosphate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium citrate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium phosphate and mixtures thereof.

Compatibility of piperaquine with the coacervation process conditions A compatibility study is carried out on piperaquine to assess the compatibility of the drug with the coacervation process. In particular, piperaquine undergoes heating/ cooling cycles mimicking thermal excursions of the process. Then, the following tests are performed both before and after thermal cycles to ascertain the stability of piperaquine: water content analysis (Karl Fisher test); effect of mechanical stress; crystalline structure by XRPD. The results are summarized in the following Table 3. PQPMFLO before thermal Ρζ)Ρ·4Η2Ο after thermal Test cycle cycle Assay (%) 99.9 99.9 (PQP*4H20) Water content (%) 8.9 8.5 The crystalline structure of piperaquine and that of the microcapsules of the Sample 2 are measured by XRPD and compared (Figure 1): the process does not affect the crystalline structure of the PQP^hLO, since no change in the crystalline structure is recorded. The analysis confirms that the Ρζ)Ρ·4Η2Ο is not affected by heating/cooling cycle. 2.3. Particle size distribution The PSD for the different samples is measured and reported in Table 4; all the samples match the 180-400 pm range. It is clear that the change of the coating level and the application of a different process conditions do not significantly affect the PSD of the microcapsules.

Photo stability test Piperaquine microcapsules are tested for their photostability; the tested samples have coating level 10% and 20% w/w and are prepared both with ethylcellulose 1.2%w/w and epolene 2.0%w/w and with ethylcellulose 1.2%w/wand epolene 0.5%w/w. The test is carried out by comparing the microcapsules versus the piperaquine alone. The samples do not show differences in discoloration upon light exposure. 2.5. Dissolution, assay and water content of microcapsules The results of the “in vitro” dissolution test (DRT) of microcapsules are summarized in Table 7 and presented as a graph in Figure 2.

With regards to Karl Fischer data, it is observed that the loss of water is very limited (above 7% referred to the drug only and not to the microcapsules); this behavior is important because it shows that no change in crystalline structure occurs during processing. In fact, when an excessive water loss occurs than this may induce a change of the crystalline structure of the drug, i.e. from crystalline to amorphous. Table 8 and Figure 3 show that the 15% coating level microcapsules produced at different scale and different processing condition behaves similarly in term of DRT, PSD, coating efficiency. The level of reproducibility is high.

Piperaquine microcapsules prepared at industrial scale 3.1.Method of preparation Piperaquine tetraphosphate tetrahydrate, excipients and cyclohexane are placed into the 80 gallons reactor. The reactor paddle speed is set and the thermal cycle of microencapsulation begins; the temperature parameters of the cycle are set (maximum heating temperature 80°C). Drugs, polymeric material, phase separation inducing agent and solvent are loaded in amount as reported in Table 12.

The supernatant (solvent and polyethylene excipient) is removed using a pump and fresh solvent is added (about 120 kg). The agitation is restarted for short period of time and then the microcapsules are filtered under vacuum in a fluid bed equipped with a 70 pm stainless steel sieve on the bottom. The whole process and the filtration as well is carried out in inert nitrogen atmosphere. After the solvent removal by filtration, the microcapsules are dried up to the level of the residual cyclohexane of below 3880 ppm. The obtained product is discharged and sieved trough a 600 pm stainless steel sieve. A set of coacervation processes are performed (Table 13), wherein a different stirrer speed is applied: about 100 rpm (Sample 23, Sample 24, Sample 25) and or about 65-70 rpm (Sample 26, Sample 27, Sample 28, Sample 29).

Stability of these batches has been evaluated at accelerated conditions (40°C/ 75% RH) for a period of 6 months, as well as at long-term stability conditions (25°C/ 60% RH) for a period of 12 months.
