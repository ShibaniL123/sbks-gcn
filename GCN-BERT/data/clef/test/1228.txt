This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 13/641,015, filed Oct. 12, 2012, which is a U.S. national stage entry of International Application No. PCT/US2011/032709, filed Apr. 15, 2011, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/324,657, filed Apr. 15, 2010, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. 1. FIELD Described herein are compositions comprising shortened fibers of poly-N-acetylglucosamine and/or a derivative thereof (“sNAG nanofibers”) and anti-bacterial applications of such compositions. The sNAG nanofibers may be formulated into compositions for the prevention and/or treatment of bacterial infections and diseases associated with such infections. Regimens employing such compositions are also described. 2. BACKGROUND Currently, antibiotics are a standard therapy for bacterial infections. However, some individuals have an allergic reaction to certain antibiotics, others suffer from side effects associated with antibiotics, and the continued use of antibiotics often leads to a reduction in their efficacy. In addition, antibiotic therapy often leads to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. Accordingly, there is a continuing need for new anti-bacterial agents that are effective in fighting infection without generating resistance or reducing the efficacy overtime. There is a need for non-antibiotic anti-bacterial agents that can be used in clinical settings, e.g., in the treatment of infectious diseases of the skin, digestive and respiratory tract, and in wound treatment. Wound infection is one type of bacterial infection. Wound infection is a major complication, especially in patients with chronic disease such as diabetes or during immunosuppression. Such patients have disruptions in appropriate inflammatory responses, including the migration and recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages, which predisposes them to increased infection (Singer, A. J. and R. A. Clark, 1999, N Engl J Med 341(10): 738-46). In addition, bacterial infection can lead to impairment of wound healing and sepsis. Given the ineffectiveness of many current antibiotic treatments and the increased prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria such as MRSA (Methycillin-resistant S. aureus), new clinical treatments are in high demand. 3.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The inventors have discovered that sNAG nanofibers decrease bacterial infection of cutaneous wounds infected with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeurginosa. Without being bound by any specific mechanism of action, data presented in Section 6.2 suggests that the antibacterial effect of sNAG is not due to a direct interaction of sNAG with the bacteria but is due to downstream affects such as, for example, the regulation of defensins by Akt1 activation. Specifically, data show that treatment of bacterial cultures with sNAG nanofibers in vitro does not affect bacterial count indicating that sNAG nanofibers do not directly inhibit bacterial growth. In a specific example described in Section 6.2.2.5 and illustrated in FIG. 11E, sNAG nanofibers do not have a direct effect on growth or survival of Staphylococcus aureus. The test described in Section 6.2.2.5, infra, may be used to test the lack of a direct effect of sNAG nanofibers on bacterial growth or survival. In this example, S. aureus cultures in solution were treated with varying concentrations of sNAG nanofibers for three hours, cultures were then plated overnight at 37° C. and bacterial CFU/ml determined. As shown in FIG. 11E, no effect on bacterial growth or survival was observed. The inventors of the present invention have found that sNAG nanofibers can stimulate expression of defensins, which may boost the innate anti-bacterial response. It is widely accepted that defensins are important players in innate immunity and function in anti-bacterial activities. As demonstrated in the examples presented in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, infra, the inventors of the present invention have found that sNAG nanofibers can increase the expression of both α- and β-type defensins in endothelial cells and β-type defensins in keratinocytes in vitro and in a wound healing model in vivo. Further, as demonstrated in the examples presented in Sections 6.1 and 6.2, infra, but without being bound by any specific mechanism of action, Akt1 appears to be important for sNAG-dependent defensin expression in vitro and in vivo, in a wound healing model. Consistently, sNAG treatment decreased bacterial infection of cutaneous wounds infected with Staphylococcus aureus in wild type control animals but not in similarly treated Akt1 null animals. The inventors of this invention have also found that a number of Toll-like receptors can be up-regulated by sNAG treatment of human endothelial cells. Toll-like receptors (“TLRs” or “TLR”) are highly conserved receptors that recognize specific molecular patterns of bacterial components leading to activation of innate immunity. Recent work has linked human defensin expression to TLR activation. In particular, stimulation of TLRs can lead to increased defensin synthesis. Thus, without being bound by any mechanism of action, sNAG nanofibers may act as a stimulator of innate immunity and bacterial clearance via the activation of Akt1. Accordingly, described herein is the use of sNAG nanofibers as a novel method for preventing and/or treating bacterial infections and diseases associated therewith. In certain embodiments, treatment of bacterial infections with sNAG nanofibers decreases the bacterial load in patients. In specific embodiments, the use of sNAG nanofibers enhances wound closure while simultaneously eradicating, decreasing or preventing bacterial infection of the wound. 5.1 sNAG Nanofibers Described herein are sNAG nanofiber compositions.

In certain embodiments, 1% to 5%, 5% to 10%, 5% to 15%, 20% to 30% or 25% to 30% of the sNAG nanofibers are deacetylated. In some embodiments, 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, or 30% of the sNAG nanofibers are deacetylated. In other embodiments, less than 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2% or 1% of the sNAG nanofibers are deacetylated. In some embodiments, equal to or more than 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 99%, or all (100%), of the sNAG nanofibers are deacetylated. In other embodiments, less than 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, or 100% of the sNAG nanofibers are deacetylated. In certain embodiments, 70% to 80%, 75% to 80%, 75% to 85%, 85% to 95%, 90% to 95%, 90% to 99% or 95% to 100% of the sNAG nanofibers are acetylated.

In other embodiments, more than 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98%, 99%, 99.5% or 99.9% of the sNAG nanofibers are acetylated. In some embodiments, equal to or more than 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or 99%, or all (100%), of the sNAG nanofibers are acetylated.

In some embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers comprise at least one glucosamine monosaccharide, and may further comprise at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 99% of the N-acetylglucosamine monosaccharides. In other embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers comprise at least one N-acetylglucosamine monosaccharide, and may further comprise at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or 99% of glucosamine monosaccharides. In one aspect, the sNAG nanofibers increase the metabolic rate of serum-starved human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (“EC”) in a MTT assay. A MTT assay is a laboratory test and a standard colorimetric assay (an assay which measures changes in color) for measuring cellular proliferation (cell growth). Briefly, yellow MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a tetrazole) is reduced to purple formazan in the mitochondria of living cells. This reduction takes place only when mitochondrial reductase enzymes are active, and therefore conversion can be directly related to the number of viable (living) cells. The metabolic rate of cells may be determined by other techniques commonly known to the skilled artisan. In another aspect, the sNAG nanofibers do not rescue apoptosis of serum-starved EC in a trypan blue exclusion test. A trypan blue exclusion test is a dye exclusion test used to determine the number of viable cells present in a cell suspension. It is based on the principle that live cells possess intact cell membranes that exclude certain dyes, such as trypan blue, Eosin, or propidium, whereas dead cells do not. The viability of cells may be determined by other techniques commonly known to the skilled artisan. In certain embodiments, compositions comprising the sNAG nanofibers are described, wherein the sNAG nanofibers increase the metabolic rate of serum-starved human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells in a MTT assay and/or do not rescue apoptosis of serum-starved human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells in a trypan blue exclusion test. In some embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers increase the metabolic rate of serum-starved human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells in a MTT assay and do not rescue apoptosis of serum-starved human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells in a trypan blue exclusion test. In a specific embodiment, the sNAG nanofibers are biocompatible. Biocompatibility may be determined by a variety of techniques, including, but not limited to such procedures as the elution test, intramuscular implantation, or intracutaneous or systemic injection into animal subjects. Such tests are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,686,342 (see, e.g., Example 10), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In certain embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers used in the methods described herein are non-reactive in a biocompatibility test or tests. For example, the sNAG nanofibers used in the methods described herein may be non-reactive when tested in an elution test, an intramuscular implantation test, an intracutaneous test, and/or a systemic test. In other embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers used in the methods described herein have Grade 0 or Grade 1 test score when tested in an elution test, an intramuscular implantation test, an intracutaneous test, or a systemic test. In yet another embodiment, the sNAG nanofibers used in the methods described herein are at most mildly reactive when tested in an elution test, an intramuscular implantation test, an intracutaneous test, and/or a systemic test. In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein do not cause an allergenic reaction or an irritation. In other embodiments, the compositions described herein cause at most a mild allergenic reaction or a mild irritation, e.g., at the site of application. The relevant tests and evaluation of test results are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,686,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and in Section 6.8, infra. In a specific embodiment, the sNAG nanofibers are non-reactive when tested in an intramuscular implantation test. In one aspect, an intramuscular implantation test is an intramuscular implantation test—ISO 4 week implantation, as described in Section 6.8.3, infra. In certain embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers display no biological reactivity as determined by an elution test (Elution Test Grade=0). In some embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers have a test score equal to “0” and/or are at most a negligible irritant as determined by intracutaneous injection test. In some embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers elicit no intradermal reaction (i.e., Grade I reaction) in Kligman test and/or have a weak allergenic potential as determined by Kligman test. In certain aspects, the sNAG nanofibers are immunoneutral (i.e., they do not elicit an immune response). In some embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers are biodegradable. The sNAG nanofibers preferably degrade within about 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days (1 week), 8 days, 10 days, 12 days, 14 days (2 weeks), 17 days, 21 days (3 weeks), 25 days, 28 days (4 weeks), 30 days, 1 month, 35 days, 40 days, 45 days, 50 days, 55 days, 60 days, 2 months, 65 days, 70 days, 75 days, 80 days, 85 days, 90 days, 3 months, 95 days, 100 days or 4 months after administration or implantation into a patient. In certain embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers do not cause a detectable foreign body reaction. A foreign body reaction, which may occur during wound healing, includes accumulation of exudate at the site of injury, infiltration of inflammatory cells to debride the area, and the formation of granulation tissue. The persistent presence of a foreign body can inhibit full healing. Rather than the resorption and reconstruction that occurs in wound healing, the foreign body reaction is characterized by the formation of foreign body giant cells, encapsulation of the foreign object, and chronic inflammation. Encapsulation refers to the firm, generally avascular collagen shell deposited around a foreign body, effectively isolating it from the host tissues. In one embodiment, treatment of a site (e.g., a wound or a site of a bacterial infection in a wound) with the sNAG nanofibers does not elicit a detectable foreign body reaction in 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, 10 days or 14 days after treatment. In one such embodiment, treatment of a site (e.g., a wound) with the sNAG nanofibers does not elicit a foreign body encapsulations in 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, 10 days or 14 days after treatment. In some embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers (i) comprise fibers, wherein majority of the fibers are between about 1 and 15 microns in length, and (ii) (a) increase the metabolic rate of serum-starved EC in a MTT assay and/or do not rescue apoptosis of serum-starved EC in a trypan blue exclusion test, and (b) are non-reactive when tested in an intramuscular implantation test. In certain embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers (i) comprise fibers, wherein majority of the fibers are between about 1 and 12 microns in length, and (ii) (a) increase the metabolic rate of serum-starved EC in a MTT assay and/or do not rescue apoptosis of serum-starved EC in a trypan blue exclusion test, and (b) are non-reactive when tested in an intramuscular implantation test. In certain embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers (i) comprise fibers, wherein majority of the fibers are between about 4 and 7 microns in length, and (ii) (a) increase the metabolic rate of serum-starved EC in a MTT assay and/or do not rescue apoptosis of serum-starved EC in a trypan blue exclusion test, and (b) are non-reactive when tested in an intramuscular implantation test. In certain embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers do not have a direct effect on the growth or survival of bacteria, such as S. aureus, as determined by one skilled in the art. In other embodiments, sNAG nanofibers do not have a direct effect on the growth or survival of bacteria, such as S. aureus, as determined by the methods set forth in Section 6.2.2.5, infra. In some embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers do not have a direct effect in vitro on bacterial growth or survival. In one embodiment, the sNAG nanofibers do not have a direct effect (e.g., in vitro) on growth or survival of gram-negative bacteria. In another embodiment, the sNAG nanofibers do not have a direct effect (e.g., in vitro) on growth or survival of gram-positive bacteria. In yet another embodiment, the sNAG nanofibers do not have a direct effect (e.g., in vitro) on growth or survival of either gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. In some embodiments, the sNAG nanofiber or a sNAG nanofiber composition does not bind bacteria (e.g., gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, or both types of bacteria). In some embodiments, incubation of a bacterial culture with the sNAG nanofibers (e.g., 50-500 μg of sNAG nanofibers) in vitro does not reduce bacterial load in 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours or 96 hours of incubation (wherein the bacterial culture may be gram-positive and/or a gram-negative). In some embodiments, incubation of a S. aureus culture with sNAG nanofibers (e.g., about 80 μg-300 μg, or about 100-200 μg of sNAG nanofibers) in vitro does not reduce bacterial load in 2 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours or 24 hours of incubation. In yet other embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers reduce bacterial growth or survival in vitro by less than 1 log, 0.9 log, 0.8 log, 0.75 log, 0.7 log, 0.6 log, 0.5 log, 0.4 log, 0.3 log, 0.25 log, 0.2 log, 0.1 log, 0.05 log, or 0.025 log, for example, when Staphylococcus aureus bacterial cultures are treated/incubated with the sNAG nanofibers in vitro. In some embodiments, the sNAG nanofibers reduce bacterial growth or survival in vitro by less than 1×104, 2×104, 3×104, 4×104, 5×104, 6×104, 7×104, 8×104, 9×104, or 10×104 cfu/ml, for example, when Staphylococcus aureus bacterial cultures are treated/incubated with the sNAG nanofibers in vitro.

Alternatively, poly-N-acetylglucosamine polymers or fibers, and any derivatives of poly-N-acetylglucosamine polymers or fibers described above, can be irradiated when wet. The methods of making sNAG nanofibers by irradiation and the sNAG nanofibers so produced have been described in U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2009/0117175, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In certain embodiments, the poly-N-acetylglucosamine polymers or fibers are formulated into a suspension/slurry or wet cake for irradiation. Irradiation can be performed prior to, concurrently with or following the formulation of the polymers or fibers into its final formulation, such as a dressing. Generally, the polymer or fiber content of suspensions/slurries and wet cakes can vary, for example from about 0.5 mg to about 50 mg of polymer or fiber per 1 ml of distilled water are used for slurries and from about 50 mg to about 1000 mg of polymer or fiber per 1 ml of distilled water are use for wet cake formulations. The polymer or fiber may first be lyophilized, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and pulverized, to make it more susceptible to forming a suspension/slurry or wet cake. Also, the suspensions/slurries can be filtered to remove water such that a wet cake is formed. In certain aspects, the polymer or fiber is irradiated as a suspension comprising about 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, 4 mg, 5 mg, 6 mg, 7 mg, 8 mg, 9 mg, 10 mg, 12 mg, 15 mg, 18 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg or 50 mg of polymer or fiber per ml of distilled water, or any range in between the foregoing embodiments (e.g., 1-10 mg/ml, 5-15 mg/ml, 2-8 mg/ml, 20-50 mg/ml, etc.). In other aspects, the polymer or fiber is irradiated as a wet cake, comprising about 50-1,000 mg polymer or fiber per 1 ml of distilled water. In specific embodiments, the wet cake comprises about 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 or 1000 mg of polymer or fiber per 1 ml distilled water, or any range in between (e.g., 100-500 mg/ml, 300-600 mg/ml, 50-1000 mg/ml, etc.). The irradiation is preferably in the form of gamma radiation, e-beam radiation, or x-rays. Two sources of irradiation are preferred: radioactive nuclides and electricity. In specific embodiment, the radioactive nuclides are cobalt-60 and cesium-137. Both of these nuclides emit gamma rays, which are photons containing no mass. The gamma rays have energies from 0.66 to 1.3 MeV. Using electricity, electrons are generated and accelerated to energies up to 10 MeV or higher. When irradiating polymers or fibers to reduce their size, a consideration to take into account is that the depth of penetration of materials with densities similar to water by 10 MeV electrons is limited to about 3.7 cm with one-sided exposure or about 8.6 cm with two-sided exposure. Depth of penetration decreases at lower electron energies. Electron energy can be converted to x-rays by placing a metal (usually tungsten or tantalum) target in the electron beam path. Conversion to x-rays is limited to electrons with energies up to 5 MeV. X-rays are photons with no mass and can penetrate polymers or fibers similar to gamma rays. There is only about 8% efficiency in the conversion of electron energy to x-ray energy. High powered electron beam machines are needed in x-ray production facilities to account for the low conversion efficiency. In a specific embodiment, the irradiation is gamma irradiation. The absorbed dose of radiation is the energy absorbed per unit weight of product, measured in gray (gy) or kilogray (kgy). For dried polymers or fibers, the preferred absorbed dose is about 500-2,000 kgy of radiation, most preferably about 750-1,250 kgy or about 900-1,100 kgy of radiation. For wet polymers or fibers, the preferred absorbed dose is about 100-500 kgy of radiation, most preferably about 150-250 kgy or about 200-250 kgy of radiation. The dose of radiation can be described in terms of its effect on the length of the polymers or fibers. In specific embodiments, the dose of radiation used preferably reduces the length of the polymer or fiber by anywhere from about 10% to 90% of the starting length of the polymer or fiber, respectively. In specific embodiments, the average length is reduced by about 10%, by about 20%, by about 30%, by about 40%, by about 50%, by about 60%, by about 70%, by about 80%, or by about 90%, or any range in between (e.g., 20-40%, 30-70%, and so on and so forth). Alternatively, the dose of radiation used preferably reduces the length of the polymer or fiber to anywhere from 1 to 100 microns. In specific embodiments, and depending on the starting fiber length, the average length of the polymer or fiber is reduced to less than about 15 microns, less than about 14 microns, less than about 13 microns, less than about 12 microns, less than about 11 microns, less than about 10 microns, less than about 8 microns, less than about 7 microns, less than about 5 microns, less than about 4 microns, less than about 3 microns, less than 2 microns, or less than 1 microns.

In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein are used to treat and/or prevent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. Pseudomonas is a gram-negative aerobic bacteria found in soil, water, other moist environments, plants and animals, clinical isolates of which produce the blue-green pigment pyocyanin and a characteristic sweet odor. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known to cause urinary tract infections, pneumonia, respiratory system infections, dermatitis, soft tissue infections, bacterimia, bone and joint infections, gastrointestinal infections and a variety of systemic infections. It is known to be an important cause of infections, particularly in patients with burns, patients with cystic fibrosis, patients who are immunosuppressed (e.g., AIDS and cancer patients), and in patients who have been hospitalized for longer than 1 week. It is a frequent cause of nosocomial infections such as but not limited to pneumonia, urinary tract infections and bacterimia. Any one or all of these infections may be prevented and/or treated by the compositions described herein. In some embodiments, the compositions described herein are used to treat and/or prevent Staph infections, and particularly, Staphylococcus aureus infections. Use of a sNAG nanofiber composition in this embodiment and other embodiments described herein may preclude the generation of resistant organisms as well as allow for the antibiotic-independent clearance of a bacterial infection. In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein may be used to combat bacteria that are resistant to one or more anti-bacterial agents. For example, the compositions described herein may be used to treat bacteria that are resistant to one or more antibiotics, for example resistant to conventional antibiotics such as MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), VRSA (Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus), VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococus), Penicillin-resistant Enterococcus, PRSP (Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia), isoniazid/rifampin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria (e.g., resistant strains of E. coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Streptococci). In one embodiment, the compositions disclosed herein may be used to treat multiple drug resistant bacteria. In some specific embodiments, the compositions described herein may be used to treat and/or prevent Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (“MRSA”; it may also be called multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (“ORSA”)). MRSA is any strain of Staphylococcus aureus that has developed resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, which include but are not limited to the penicillins (penicillin, methicillin, dicloxacillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, etc.) and the cephasosporins. Some of the known strains of MRSA include EMRSA15 and EMRSA16 (also known as MRSA252), which are resistant to erythromycin and ciprofloxacin; CC8 (also known as ST8:USA300); ST1:USA400; ST8:USA500; ST59:USA000; ST93 strains; ST80 strains; and ST59 strains. MRSA is responsible for a number of infections in humans. MRSA is a serious health concern, causing approximately 50% of health-care associated staph infections. In the U.S., more than 94,000 people develop serious MRSA infection and about 19,000 die from infection each year. Especially prevalent MRSA is in hospitals; where risk factors for MRSA infection include prior antibiotic exposure (e.g., quinolone antibiotics), admission to an intensive care unit, surgery and exposure to an MRSA-colonized patient. Patients with open wounds, immunocompromised patients (due to, e.g., HIV/AIDS, cancer, transplant procedure, severe asthma), young children (e.g., human infant and human toddler), and the elderly (e.g., elderly human) are at high risk of developing an MRSA infection. Higher risk rates for MRSA infection are also observed in injection drug users, persons with diabetes, patients with dermatologic conditions, patients with invasive devices (e.g., intravascular catheters), and health care workers and other people who spend time in confined spaces (prison inmates, soldiers, patients in long-term healthcare facilities, such as nursing homes). S. aureus most commonly colonizes the anterior nares (the nostrils), although the rest of the respiratory tract, opened wounds, intravenous catheters and urinary tract are also potential sites for infection. Most of community-associated MRSA infections are localized to the skin and soft tissue. The initial symptoms of MRSA include red bumps that resemble pimples, spider bites or boils that may be accompanied by fever and rashes; the bumps may later develop into pus-filled boils. Common manifestations of community-associated MRSA are skin infections such as necrotizing fasciitis or pyomyositis, necrotizing pneumonia, infective endocarditis, bone or joint infections. Some MRSA leads to sepsis and toxic shock syndrome, which may be due to toxins carried by such strains (e.g., PVL, PSM). MRSA may cause cellulitis. Any of the above-listed or known in the art strains of MRSA, patients diagnosed with MRSA, symptoms of MRSA, patient populations at risk of MRSA and/or diseases associated with MRSA may be treated with the compositions described herein. In some embodiments, the compositions described herein prevent onset or development of one or more of the symptoms of MRSA, or reduce duration and/or severity of one or more of these symptoms (e.g., symptoms described herein). The compositions described herein may be used as bactericidal agents to kill or damage unwanted bacteria. For example, the compositions described herein may be used to treat established bacterial infections, prophylactically for the prevention of bacterial infections, or administered topically to areas of a subject that are susceptible to infection or to areas of the body that are likely sites for bacterial growth (e.g., the gums, open wounds, bed sores, and vaginal or groin areas). In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein reduce bacterial growth and/or bacterial survival by more than about 0.1 log, 0.2 log, 0.25 log, 0.3 log, 0.4 log, 0.5 log, 0.6 log, 0.7 log, 0.75 log, 0.8 log, 0.9 log, 1 log, 1.25 log, 1.5 log, 1.75 log, 2 log, 2.25 log, 2.5 log, 2.75 log, 3 log, 3.25 log, 3.5 log, 3.75 log, 4 log, 4.5 log, 5 log, 5.5 log, 6 log, 6.5 log, 7 log, 7.5 log, 8 log, 8.5 log, 9 log, 9.5 log, 10 log, 10.5 log, 11 log, 11.5 log, 12 log, 12.5 log, 13 log, 13.5 log, 14 log, 14.5 log, or 15 log of colony forming units (CFU)/mL.

There are two types of wounds, open and closed. Open wounds are classified according to the object that caused the wound. For example, incisions or incised wounds (including surgical wounds) are caused by a clean, sharp-edged object such as a knife, a razor or a glass splinter. Lacerations are irregular wounds caused by a blunt impact to soft tissue which lies over hard tissue (e.g., laceration of the skin covering the skull) or tearing of skin and other tissues such as caused by childbirth. Abrasions or grazes are superficial wounds in which the topmost layer of the skin (the epidermis) is scraped off. Puncture wounds are caused by an object puncturing the skin, such as a nail or needle. Penetration wounds are caused by an object such as a knife entering the body. Gunshot wounds are caused by a bullet or similar projectile driving into (e.g., entry wound) and/or through the body (e.g., exit wound). In a medical context, all stab wounds and gunshot wounds are considered open wounds. Open wounds also include burn wounds induced by thermal, chemical, or electrical injury. Closed wounds include contusions (more commonly known as a bruise, caused by blunt force trauma that damages tissue under the skin), hematoma (also called a blood tumor, caused by damage to a blood vessel that in turn causes blood to collect under the skin), and crushing injuries (caused by a great or extreme amount of force applied over a long period of time). In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein are used to treat a bacterial infected open wound or prevent a bacterial infection in an open wound. In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein may be used to treat or prevent a bacterial infection of a gunshot wound, a puncture wound and/or a penetration wound. In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein may be used to treat or prevent a post-operative bacterial infection, a surgical site bacterial infection, a catheter-related bacterial infection or a hemodialysis-related bacterial infection. In yet another embodiment, the compositions described herein are not used to treat or prevent a bacterial infection in an open wound, a gunshot wound, a puncture wound and/or a penetration wound. In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein are not used to treat or prevent a post-operative bacterial infection, a surgical site bacterial infection, a catheter-related bacterial infection or hemodialysis-related bacterial infection. In some embodiments, the wound is a chronic wound. Chronic wound can be any wound that fails to heal properly, including a surgical wound (e.g., a skin graft donor site), a cutaneous ulcer (e.g., a diabetic ulcer, a venous stasis ulcer, a leg ulcer, an arterial insufficiency ulcer, or a pressure ulcer), or a burn wound. In one embodiment, the compositions described herein are used to treat or prevent chronic wound infections (e.g. an infection associated with a diabetic ulcer, a venous stasis ulcer, a leg ulcer, an arterial insufficiency ulcer, a pressure ulcer, a surgical wound, or a burn). In yet another embodiment, the compositions described herein are not used to treat or prevent chronic wound bacterial infections (e.g. not used to prevent a bacterial infection associated with a diabetic ulcer, a venous stasis ulcer, a leg ulcer, an arterial insufficiency ulcer, a pressure ulcer, a surgical wound, or a burn). In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein are used to treat or prevent nosocomial bacterial infections. Of the nosocomial bacterial infections, surgical wound bacterial infections predominate; with statistics showing up to 8% of all surgical patients. The direct cost of these types of infections is approximately 4.5 billion dollars per year. Many of hospital-contracted bacteria developed resistance against antibiotics, and thus non-antibiotic-based treatments are desired. Use of the sNAG compositions described herein in a hospital setting could defray much of the cost and markedly reduce the production of antibiotic resistant species. In yet another embodiment, the compositions described herein are not used to treat or prevent nosocomial bacterial infections, such as surgical bacterial infections. In one embodiment, the compositions described herein may be used to treat or prevent bacterial infections in bleeding wounds (e.g., bleeding surface wounds). In one embodiment, the compositions described herein may be used to treat a gunshot wound, a puncture wound, a penetration wound or a surgical wound in order to treat or prevent bacterial infection in such wound. In yet another embodiment, the compositions described herein are not used to treat or prevent bacterial infections in bleeding wounds (e.g., bleeding surface wounds). The compositions described herein may be useful for treating or preventing a bacterial infection in cutaneous wounds, such as wounds affecting the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin, as well as injuries to the cornea and epithelia-lined organs, in order to treat or prevent a bacterial infection in such wounds. The wounds may be caused by a wide variety of physical trauma, including cuts, abrasions, burns, chemical exposure, surgical procedures (e.g., surgical incisions, skin grafting). In one embodiment, the compositions described herein may be used for treating corneal and sclera wounds, including wounds which affect the epithelial layer, stromal layer and endothelial layers of the eye in order to treat or prevent a bacterial infection in such wounds. In yet another embodiment, the compositions described herein are not used to treat or prevent bacterial infections in cutaneous wounds. In some embodiments, the compositions described herein may be used to treat a wound in a patient diagnosed with a bacterial infection. In certain embodiments, where the compositions described herein are used to treat a bacterial infected wound, a wound is determined to be bacterially infected by a test or an assay for the presence of a bacterial antigen. In one embodiment, a wound culture is performed to detect a bacterial infection in the wound of a patient. In yet other embodiments, a wound is determined to be infected due to the presence of one or more symptoms of bacterial infection. In other embodiments, the compositions described herein may be used to treat a wound in a patient when a patient displays one or more of the symptoms of bacterial infection such as: a wound is slow to heal; heat, redness and/or swelling at the site of the wound; tenderness at the site of the wound; drainage of fluid or pus at the site of the wound; and/or fever. Symptoms of wound bacterial infection include but are not limited to localized erythema, localized pain, localized heat, cellulitis, oedema, abscess, discharge which may be viscous, discolored and purulent, delayed of wound healing, discoloration of tissues both within and/or at the wound margins, friable, bleeding granulation tissue, abnormal smell coming from the wound site, unexpected pain and/or tenderness at the site of dressing change, lymphangitis (i.e., a red line originating from the wound and leading to swollen tender lymph glands draining the affected area), and wound breakdown associated with wound pocketing/bridging at base of wound (i.e., a wound develops strips of granulation tissue in the base as opposed to a uniform spread of granulation tissue across the whole of the wound bed). In some embodiments, the compositions described herein prevent the onset or development of one or more of the above-listed symptoms, or reduce duration and/or severity of one or more of these symptoms. In one embodiment, the compositions described herein may be used for wound healing and treatment of a wound bacterial infection, or for wound healing and prevention of a wound bacterial infection. In one embodiment, the compositions described herein are used to enhance wound healing while concurrently treating or preventing a wound bacterial infection. Effects of the sNAG nanofiber compositions on wound healing and some of the uses of the sNAG nanofibers in wound healing applications have been described in U.S. Patent Pub. No. 2009/0117175, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety (see, e.g., Example 2). 5.4.2 Treatment or Prevention of Other Bacterial Infections In certain embodiments, the sNAG nanofiber compositions described herein may be used to treat and/or prevent bacterial infections of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, urinary tract, reproductive tract, blood, throat, ears, eye, sinus or any other organ or tissue of the body. In another embodiment, the sNAG nanofiber compositions described herein may be used to treat and/or prevent skin conditions, gastrointestinal conditions, respiratory conditions and/or conditions of any other organ or tissue associated with a bacterial infection. In some embodiments, the sNAG nanofiber compositions described herein are applied topically on the skin, mouth, ear, eye, anus or groin areas of a patient to treat or prevent a bacterial infection. In some embodiments, the compositions described herein are used to treat and/or prevent a bacterial infection of an organ or tissue of the body that is not at the site of a wound, and/or is not associated with or caused by a wound. In certain embodiments, the sNAG nanofiber compositions described herein are used to treat an existing bacterial infection. For example, such compositions may be used to treat a subject diagnosed with a bacterial infection by a test or an assay, such as one of the tests described herein or known in the art. Alternatively, such compositions may be used to treat a subject displaying one or more symptoms of a bacterial infection or a disease associated with a bacterial infection, such as one or more symptoms of a bacterial infection known to a skilled artisan (e.g., determined by a treating doctor/physician to be a symptom of a bacterial infection) and/or described herein. In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein are used to treat a condition associated with an imbalance in bacterial microbiota, or a condition associated with an abnormal or altered bacterial microbiota. For example, such compositions may be used to treat a skin condition in a patient whose skin bacterial microbiota differs from that in control subjects (e.g., subjects with no symptoms of the skin condition). In other examples, such compositions may be used to treat an intestinal condition (or a condition of any other tissue or organ) in a patient whose intestinal bacterial microbiota (or microbiota of the other tissue or organ) differs from that in control subjects (e.g., subjects with no symptoms of the intestinal condition). In other embodiments, the compositions described herein may be used to treat any disease known to be associated with or exacerbated by a bacterial infection (e.g., acne). In one embodiment, the compositions described herein may be used to treat a cystic fibrosis patient infected by P. aeruginosa. In some embodiments, the compositions described herein are effective against toxins secreted or excreted by bacteria. In one embodiment, the compositions described herein may be used to inhibit/reduce a bacterial toxin (and/or a condition or symptom caused by a bacterial toxin), for example toxins produced by Bacillus anthracis, Clostridium difficile, Corvnebacterium diphtheria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; endotoxins, and/or the cytolysins. Some defensins are able to inhibit bacterial toxins, including those produced by Bacillus anthracis, Clostridium difficile, Cornebacterium diphtheria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the cytolysins (endotoxins produced by Gram-positive bacteria that lyse red blood cells). Given these functions of defensins, activation of pathways resulting in defensin expression and secretion may allow for the antibiotic-independent clearance of bacterial infection, and thus avoid the generation of bacterial resistance. In certain embodiments, the compositions described herein may be used to treat and/or prevent one or more bacterial infections of the skin, or diseases of the skin associated with a bacterial infection. In some embodiments, the compositions described herein are used to treat localized skin infections and/or diffuse skin infections. In some embodiments, the compositions described herein are used to treat or prevent skin infections or diseases of the skin associated with bacterial infections affecting the epidermis, dermis, and/or subcutaneous (hypodermis) tissues of the skin. In some of these embodiments, the affected layers of the skin include one or more layers of the epidermis (i.e., stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum licidum, and stratum corneum), one or more types of tissues of the dermis (i.e., collagen, elastic tissue, and reticular fibers), one or more layers of the dermis (i.e., the upper, papillary layer and the lower reticular layer); and/or one or more types of tissue of the hypodermis (i.e., fat, elastin and connective tissue). In an embodiment, the compositions described herein are used to treat or prevent bacterial infections on the skin surface. In another embodiment, the compositions described herein are used to treat or prevent a Staphylococcus (“Staph”) infection of the skin and/or a Streptococcus (“Strep”) infection of the skin.

EXAMPLES 6.1 Example 1 sNAG Nanofibers from a Marine Diatom Promote Wound Healing and Defensin Expression Via an Akt1/Ets1-Dependent Pathway This example demonstrates that sNAG nanofibers promote cutaneous wound healing and expression of defensins, and that the Akt1→Ets1 pathway plays a central role in the regulation of cutaneous wound healing by sNAG nanofibers. 6.1.1 Materials and Methods sNAG/Taliderm nanofibers are produced and supplied by Marine Polymer Technologies and formed into suitable patches for wound treatment. Wildtype C57 Black and Akt1 null mice were housed at the Medical University of South Carolina animal facilities. Wildtype and Akt1 null mice, ages ranging from eight to 12 weeks, were anesthetized with 50% pure oxygen and 50% isoflurane gas. Immediately before wounding, Nair Hair Removal Lotion was applied to their dorsum to remove any unwanted hair. A dorsal 4 mm circular area of skin was removed using an excision biopsy punch. Taliderm was placed onto each wound at day 0 or wounds were left untreated. At days 1, 3, 5, and 7 the wounds were photographed, measured, and excised using an 8 mm biopsy punch to ensure complete removal of the wound and surrounding skin. Wildtype and Akt1 null wounds with and without Taliderm treatment were embedded in paraffin in preparation for H&E and immunofluorescent staining. Paraffin-embedded sections were sectioned and placed on microscope slides for staining. Slides were washed with xylenes to remove paraffin and rehydrated through a series of graded alcohols. The sections were then incubated in 0.1% Triton x100 for permeabilization. Sections were incubated in a boiling Antigen Retrival solution. 1% Animal serum was used for blocking before incubating in the primary goat antibody, β-defensin 3 1:400 dilution. The sections were then incubated in the primary antibody overnight at 4° in a humidity chamber. An immunofluorescent secondary Donkey α-goat 488 antibody 1:200 dilution was used, followed by nuclear staining with TOPRO-3. Images were captured using confocal microscopy. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to visualize basic structures such as the epidermis, dermis, muscle, and blood vessels and to determine the orientation and approximate location in the wound. H&E staining was also used to begin to identify which cell types are stimulated by Taliderm in an Akt1-independent manner. Other materials and methods are described in figure descriptions and in the results section below, and performed in accordance with the methods known in the art. 6.1.2 Results sNAG Nanofibers Stimulate Akt1 Activation, an Upstream Regulator of Ets1. FIG. 1A shows a Western blot analysis of phospho-Akt in response to NAG and sNAG stimulation of serum starved EC. FIG. 1B shows RT-PCR analysis of EC infected either with scrambled control or Akt1 shRNA lentiviruses and assessed for expression of Ets1 and S26 as a loading control. FIG. 1C illustrates a signal transduction pathway transducing a signal from sNAG nanofibers to Akt1, Ets1 and Defensins. Delayed Wound Healing in Akt1 Null Animals is Partially Rescued by Taliderm (sNAG) Treatment. FIG. 2A shows representative images of wounded WT and AKT1 null mice with and without treatment of Taliderm. FIG. 2B shows H&E staining of representative mouse skin sections from day 3 wounds. H&E staining of wildtype and Akt1 wound excisions indicate a Taliderm dependent increase in keratinocyte proliferation and migration. The dashed lines indicate the area of keratinocyte proliferation across the wound margin. In both the wildtype and Akt1 treated wounds there is an evident increase in reepithelization across the wound margin compared to the wildtype and Akt1 control. This indicates that Taliderm increases kertainoctye recruitment independent of the Akt pathway. Although Taliderm induces a complete reepithlization of the epidermis across the wound margin, there is still substantial lack of revascularization in the underlying tissue compared to the wildtype. This is evident by substantial hemorrhaging and infiltration of red blood cells in the Akt1 aminals. sNAG Nanofibers Stimulate Cytokine and Defensin Expression in Primary Endothelial Cells. FIG. 3A shows immunohistochemistry of EC treated with or without sNAG using an antibody directed against a-defensin. FIG. 3B presents ELISA showing that nanofiber treatment of EC results in the secretion of α-defensins 1-3. sNAG Nanofibers Stimulate Defensin Expression in Primary Endothelial Cells in an Akt1 Dependent Manner. FIGS. 4A and 4B show quantitative RT-PCR analyses of serum starved EC treated with or without sNAG, with or without PD98059 (MAPK inhibitor), Wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor) or infected with a scrambled control or Akt1 shRNA lentiviruses and assessed for expression of the genes indicated. sNAG Nano Fibers Stimulate β-Defensin 3 Expression in Mouse Keratinocytes. FIG. 5A shows immunofluorescent staining with β-defensin 3 and Involucrin antibodies of paraffin embedded mouse cutaneous wound sections from WT and Akt1 null animals on Day 3. A cutaneous wound healing model was developed in both WT and Akt1 null mice to assess the effects of Taliderm in vivo. These findings show that β-defensin 3 expression increases in Taliderm treated animals in an Akt1-dependent manner. The ability of Taliderm to increase defensin expression in a healing wound has important implications for treating and controlling wound infection. FIG. 5B shows quantification of β-defensin 3 immunofluorescent staining using NIHImageJ software. FIG. 5C shows immunofluorescent staining of WT and Akt1 null treated and untreated keratinocytes with β-Defensin 3 and TOPRO-3. Notice the increase in green β-Defensin 3 staining in WT and Akt1 Taliderm treated wounds. The immunofluorescent labeling of wound sections illustrates that Taliderm treated wounds show an increase in β-defensin 3 expression in an Akt1 dependent manner. Although the Akt1 treated wounds show a reasonable increase in β-defensin 3, the wildtype treated wounds illustrate a more remarkable increase. This indicates that 1-defensin 3 expression is not only increased by application of the nanofiber, but is at least partially dependent on the Akt1 pathway. β-defensin 3 expression seems limited to the keratinocytes indicating this expression is keratinocyte specific. Akt1 Dependent Transcription Factor Binding Sites. FIG. 6 shows schematic of Akt1 dependent transcription factor binding sites. Using Genomatix software, 500 bp upstream of the transcription start site was analyzed for conserved sites on the mRNA of DEF1, 4, and 5. 6.1.3 Conclusions The provided data show that sNAG nanofiber stimulation of Ets1 results from the activation of Akt1 by these nanofibers. Nanofiber treatment resulted in marked increases in the expression of genes involved in cellular recruitment, such as IL-1 (a known Ets1 target), VEGF and several defensins (β3, α1, α4, and α5), small anti-microbial peptides recently shown to act as chemoattractants. Both pharmacological inhibition of the PI3K/Akt1 pathway and Akt1 knockdown using shRNAs resulted in decreased expression of these chemotactic factors. Akt1 null mice exhibited a delayed wound healing phenotype that is partially rescued by Taliderm nanofibers. Taliderm treated wounds also showed an increase in defensin expression that is Akt1 dependent. The increase of β-defensin 3 expression and keratinocyte proliferation in Taliderm treated wounds demonstrates the beneficial use of Taliderm as an effective wound healing product. Taliderm acts to increase anti-microbial peptide expression in keratinocytes in an Akt1 dependent manner suggesting the essential role of Akt1 in the function of sNAG nanofibers. This correlates with the results from other studies in the laboratory (Buff, Muise-Helmericks, unpublished) that inhibition of the PI3K/Akt1 pathway and Akt1 knockdown using shRNAs results in decreased expression of these chemotactic factors. Although the increased expression of tβ-defensin 3 is Akt1-dependent, H&E staining of 8 mm wound excisions (FIG. 2B) indicated that Taliderm acts independent of Akt1 in wound reepithelization. Even though the new keratinocytes span the entire wound margin, the underlying tissue did not demonstrate the same stimulation in vascular growth. This indicates the that absence of Akt1 is responsible for leaky blood vessels and the large amount of floating red blood cells in the dermis. This suggests that Taliderm is dependent on the Akt1 pathway for an increase in vascularization. In summary, (i) sNAG nanofibers (Taliderm) increase wound healing in part by stimulating angiogenesis; (ii) sNAG nanofibers treatment of endothelial cells activate an Akt1/Ets1 dependent pathway leading to changes in cell motility and cytokine secretion; (iii) Taliderm treated wounds show increased expression of β-defensin 3 in an AKT1 dependent manner; (iv) treatment of Akt1 null animals with Taliderm partially rescues the phenotype, leading to markedly increased keratinocyte proliferation/migration; and (v) bioinformatics analysis indicates that ETS1 is likely involved in the sNAG activated pathway leading to increased wound healing and cytokine secretion. Taken together these findings suggest a central role of the Akt1-Ets1 pathway in the regulation of cutaneous wound healing by sNAG nanofibers and support the use of these nanofibers as a novel and effective method for enhancing wound healing. 6.2 Example 2 sNAG Nanofibers Increase Defensin Expression, Increase Kinetics of Wound Closure, and have an Indirect Defensin-Dependent Anti-Bacterial Effect This example demonstrates that sNAG nanofibers have a potent anti-bacterial effect against Staphylococcus aureus in vivo, which is indirect and defensin-dependent. This example also shows that sNAG nanofibers induce expression of defensins in vitro in keratinocytes and endothelial cells and in vivo in cutaneous wounds, in an Akt-1 dependent manner, and increase the kinetics of wound closure. 6.2.1 Materials and Methods Tissue Culture, Pharmacological Inhibition, ELISA: Human umbilical cord vein EC (Lonza) were maintained at 37° with 5% CO2 in endothelial basal medium 2 (Lonza). Endothelial basal medium 2 (EBM2) was supplemented with EC growth medium 2 SingleQuots as described by Lonza procedures and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Serum starvation was performed at 80-90% confluency in EBM2 supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum (Valley Biomedical) for 24 hours followed by stimulation with highly purified pGlcNAc (50 μg/ml) nanofibers (sNAG) in sterile water (provided by Marine Polymer Technologies, Inc., Danvers, Mass., USA). The pGlcNAc diatom-derived nanofibers used in this study are short biodegradable fibers derived from a longer form (NAG), and have an average length of 4-7 μm and a polymer molecular weight of approximately 60,000 Da. For inhibition using PD098059 (50 μM) or wortmannin (100 nM), cells were pre-treated for 45 minutes prior to 3 hour stimulation with sNAG (50 μg/ml). Statistical Analysis: Each quantitative experiment was performed at least in triplicate at least three independent times. All statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel to calculate means, standard deviations and student t-test Lentiviral Infection: Mission shRNA lentiviral constructs directed against Akt1 were purchased from Sigma/Aldrich. A scrambled pLKO.1 shRNA vector was purchased from Addgene. Lentiviruses were propagated in 293T cells, maintained in DMEM supplemented as above. Lentiviral production was performed using psPAX2 and pMD2.G packaging vectors purchased from Addgene using the protocol for producing lentiviral particles from Addgene. For infection of target cells, 7.5×105 cells were plated on 100 mm2 plates and allowed to incubate overnight. The next day, cells were transduced using a final concentration of 1 μg/ml polybrene and either scrambled control or Akt1 shRNA lentiviruses. After transduction, endothelial cells were serum starved overnight and stimulated with sNAG (50 g/ml) for 3 hours. All infections were monitored for appropriate knockdown by RT-PCR. RT-PCR: For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, RNA was extracted with RNAsol (Teltest, Inc.) following manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg total RNA with a Superscript First Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen), using Oligo(dT) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR reactions contained equal amounts of cDNA and 1.25 μM of the appropriate primer pair (Sigma-Proligo, St. Louis, Mo., USA). All primer sequences used in these analyses are as follows: (SEQ ID NO: 1) Akt1 F 5′ GAGGCCGTCAGCCACAGTCTC 3′ (SEQ ID NO: 2) Akt1 R 5′ ATGAGCGACGTGGCTATTGTG 3′ (SEQ ID NO: 3) β-Defensin3 F 5′ GTGGGGTGAAGCCTAGCAG 3′ (SEQ ID NO: 4) β-Defensin3 R 5′ TTTCTTTCTTCGGCAGCATT 3′ (SEQ ID NO: 5) α-Defensin1 F 5′ CACTCCAGGCAAGAGCTGAT 3′ (SEQ ID NO: 6) α-Defensin1 R 5′ TCCCTGGTAGATGCAGGTTC 3′ (SEQ ID NO: 7) S26 F 5′ CTCCGGTCCGTGCCTCCAAG 3′ (SEQ ID NO: 8) S26 R 5′ CAGAGAATAGCCTGTCTTCAG 3′ Cycling conditions were: 94° C. for 5 min; 30-35 cycles of 94° C. for 1 min, 55-65° C. (based on primer Tm) for 1 min, 72° C. for 1 min; 72° C. for 7 min and cooled to 4° C. Cycle number was empirically determined to be within the linear range of the assay for each primer pair used. All semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed with the ribosomal protein subunit S26 primers as internal controls. Products were visualized on a BioRad Molecular Imaging System (Hercules, Calif., USA). Real time PCR was performed using a Brilliant CYBR green QPCR kit in combination with an Mx3000P Real-Time PCR system both purchased from Stratagene. Primers detecting the ribosomal subunit S26 were used as internal controls. Excisional Wound Healing Model: Wild Type C57Bl/6 and Akt1−/− [43] were used in all experiments. The Akt1 null animals were created using an insertional mutagenesis strategy at the translational start site that blocks expression of the entire protein. Wounding was performed on anesthetized adult male mice between 8-12 weeks old. Two full thickness cutaneous wounds were created using a 4 mm biopsy punch (Miltex), to create two identical wounds on each flank. Mice were anesthetized using an O2/Isoflurane vaporizing anesthesia machine (VetEquip, Inc.). Isoflurane was used at 4% for induction; 2% for surgery. Prior to surgery hair was removed by depilation and the area was washed and sterilized using 70% ethanol. Wounds were either treated with sNAG membrane moistened with distilled water or left untreated. On days 3 and 5 animals were euthanized and entire wounds were harvested including the surrounding skin using an 8 mm biopsy punch (Miltex). Wounds were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for analysis. Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining (H&E): All H&E staining was performed in the Histology Core Facility at the Medical University of South Carolina, Department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology. Briefly, sections were cleared in xylene, rehydrated through a series of graded alcohols, placed in Hematoxylin followed by acid alcohol. Samples were then placed in ammonia water, rinsed in ethanol and exposed to Eosin before dehydrating through graded alcohols and clearing in xylene. Sections were mounted using Cytoseal-XYL (Richard-Allan Scientific). H&E sections were visualized using an Olympus BX40 microscope (4× objective lens, 0.13) and captured using an Olympus Camera (Model DP25) and DP2-BSW acquisition software. Bacterial Inoculation, Tissue Gram Staining, Colon), Forming Unit Quantitation: Male mice between 8-12 weeks were wounded as described above. Single colonies of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) were picked and cultured overnight at 37° and adjusted to an absorbance of OD600=0.53. One mL of S. aureus was spun at 10,000 rpm, re-suspended in sterile PBS, and 15 μl was used to innoculate each wound. sNAG membranes were applied to the treated group thirty minutes post inoculation. Mice were euthanized on day 3 and 5 post wounding and wounds were harvested using an 8 mm biopsy punch. One wound per animal was fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4° C. and the other wound was cultured and plated on LB media without antibiotic for bacterial quantitation (see below). Wounds for tissue gram staining were embedded in paraffin and sectioned. Sections were cleared in xylene and rehydrated through a series of alcohol and were stained using a tissue gram stain (Sigma-Aldrich) by procedures described by the manufacturer. For culturing, wound sections were placed in 0.5 ml bacterial media an incubated for 30 min at 37° C. while shaking. Colony forming units (CFU) were quantitated using a dilution series plated overnight at 37° C. Number of colonies per plate/per dilution were counted and CFU/ml were calculated. To determine CFU/ml from sNAG treated bacterial cultures, S. aureus cultures in solution were treated with varying concentrations of sNAG (10 μl and 20 μl of 10.8 mg/ml sNAG) for three hours. Cultures were then plated overnight at 37° and CFU/ml were determined. β-Defensin 3 Peptide Application: Three test concentrations (1.0 μM, 2.5 μM, 5.0 μM) of biologically active human β-defensin 3 peptide (Peptide Institute, Inc.) were tested for their effect on bacterial growth in the infected wound healing model described above. Each concentration negatively affected bacterial growth so the lowest concentration was chosen for analyses. After each wound was infected with S. aureus, 10 ul of peptide was applied. After three days, wounds were harvested, embedded for sectioning and gram staining, or cultured for CFU/ml quantitation as described above. β-Defensin 3 Antibody Blockade: Wild Type male mice were wounded and infected with 15 ul of S. aureus as described above. After inoculation, one wound was treated with 0.2 ug/mL of β-defensin 3 antibody (Santa Cruz) while the other was treated with 0.2 ug/mL of normal goat IgG control antibody (Santa Cruz). sNAG membranes were applied to all mice after antibody treatment on day 0. Antibody was applied every 24 hours. Mice were euthanized on day 3 and wounds were harvested using an 8 mm biopsy punch. Wounds were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4° C., embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and analyzed using tissue gram stain. CFU/ml quantitation was performed from wounds harvested on day 3 as described above. Immunofluorescence, Microscopy: Paraffin embedded tissue sections were rehydrated through xylene and a series of graded alcohols. Sections were treated with 0.01% Triton-X100 and subjected to antigen retrieval using antigen unmasking solution (Vector Laboratories) in a pressure cooker for 5 min and allowed to cool. Skin sections were labeled with β-defensin 3 goat polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), involucrin rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), and TO-PRO 3-iodide (Molecular Probes). Sections were incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4° and appropriate secondary immunofluorescent antibodies (Invitrogen) for 1 hour at room temperature. Control sections for each antibody were stained without primary antibody. Tissue sections were visualized using an Olympus FluroView laser scanning confocal microscope (Model IX70) and captured at ambient temperature using an Olympus camera (Model FV5-ZM) and Fluoview 5.0 acquisition software. All tissue sections were imaged using 60× oil immersion lens (Olympus Immersion Oil) HUVECs were either serum starved or treated with sNAG for 5 hours in culture and stained with antibodies directed against α-defensin 5 (FITC), β-defensin 3 (Texas Red), or TOPRO 3 (Blue). Images were taken using immunofluorescent microscopy. Cell culture defensin expression was visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert 100M confocal microscope and was captured at ambient temperature, using water as the medium, using LSM 510 camera (Zeiss Fluor 63xW/1.2A objective). Western Blot Analysis: Endothelial cells were serum starved prior to stimulation with sNAG (50 μl/ml) for a given time course. Cells were then lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis. The antibodies used for Western blot analysis are as follows: anti-p85 subunit of PI3K and phosphospecific Akt antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies). 6.2.2 Results 6.2.2.1. Keratinocytes and Endothelial Cells Express and Secrete Defensins when Stimulated with sNAG This example demonstrates that sNAG treatment modulates the expression of defensins, small anti-microbial peptides that are part of the innate immune response. To investigate the affect of sNAG treatment on defensin expression in vitro, primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells in culture were used. Endothelial cells express both α-type and β-type defensins when stimulated with sNAG. As shown in FIG. 7A endothelial cells treated with sNAG show an up-regulation of β-defensin 3 and α-defensin 1 mRNA expression within 1 hour of stimulation. Similar up-regulation of α-defensin 4 and 5 by sNAG treatment was also observed (data not shown). Custom gene arrays containing over 25 different defensin genes were used to confirm the expression of the α-type defensins in primary endothelial cells and the β-type defensins in keratinocytes. sNAG stimulation of endothelial cells was shown to increase the expression specifically of α-defensins 1, 4 and 5 and β-defensin 3. Additionally, sNAG stimulation of human keratinocytes increased expression of β-defensin like genes, several of which are listed in Table 1. These findings suggest that at least three α-defensin genes and β-defensin 3 are expressed in primary endothelial cells and multiple β-defensin genes are expressed in primary keratinocytes in response to sNAG stimulation. TABLE I Gene array analysis reveals numerous defensin genes upregulated by sNAG Fold Keratino- Fold HUVEC Gene Name Change cyte Gene Name Change α-defensin 1 +1.36 β-defensin 1 +1.4 α-defensin 4 +2.74 β-defensin 126 +1.73 α-defensin 5 +2.46 β-defensin +2.55 105B β-defensin 1 +2.19 β-defensin 123 +1.65 β-defensin 4 +3.06 β-defensin 129 +1.46 To test whether the sNAG-dependent defensin expression also occurred on the protein level, sNAG stimulated endothelial cells were subjected to immunofluorescence using antibodies directed against both α and β defensins. As shown in FIG. 7B, both β-defensin 3 and α-defensin 5 are up-regulated upon sNAG stimulation in this cell type. However, stimulation of primary human keratinocytes (HaCat) with sNAG did not cause increased expression of α-defensin but does cause an increase in the expression of β-defensin 3 (FIG. 7C). Taken together, these experiments suggest that sNAG stimulation results in an up-regulation of defensin peptides in both primary keratinocytes and primary endothelial cells. 6.2.2.2. sNAG-Dependent Defensin Expression Requires Akt1 Previously published data show that sNAG stimulation of primary endothelial cells results in increased integrin activation, Ets1 expression and MAP kinase activation. (Vournmakis, J. N., et al., 2008, J Vase Res. 45(3):222-32.) Findings position Akt1 upstream of Ets1 in endothelial cells and in Drosophila. (Lavenburg, K. R., et al., 2003, FASEB J. 17(15): 2278-80.) To begin to determine the signaling pathway responsible for the expression of defensins, endothelial cells were serum starved and pre-treated with pharmacological inhibitors directed against PI3K (wortmannin) or MAP kinase (PD098059) prior to sNAG stimulation. Quantitative real time PCR analysis shows that α-defensin 1 mRNA levels are greatly diminished after inhibition of either the PI3K/Akt pathway or the MAP kinase pathway (FIG. 8A). RT-PCR analysis of β-defensin 3 also shows that levels are decreased by the inhibition of these pathways as well (FIG. 8B). sNAG treatment of endothelial cells for a short time course leads to phosphorylation of Akt1, a standard indicator of its activation (FIG. 8C). To confirm that Akt1 is indeed required for defensin expression, lentiviral delivery of shRNA directed against Akt1 was used. Quantitative RT-PCR of serum starved endothelial cells infected with scrambled (SCR) control or Akt1 shRNA followed with sNAG treatment confirms that Akt1 expression is required for sNAG-dependent α-defensin expression (FIG. 8D). Since β-defensins are known to be expressed in epithelial cells, lentiviral delivery of shRNA directed against Akt1 was used in human keratinocytes (HaCat). sNAG treatment of serum starved keratinocytes infected with scrambled (SCR) control leads to a significant increase in β-defensin 3 expression that is abrogated by Akt1 knockdown (FIG. 8E). These results illustrate that sNAG treatment activates Akt1 in endothelial cells and strongly suggest that sNAG-dependent defensin expression requires Akt1 in both endothelial cells and keratinocytes. 6.2.2.3. sNAG Treatment of Cutaneous Wounds Increase Defensin Expression In Vivo To confirm the dependence of Akt1 for the expression of defensins in vivo, wild type and Akt1 null animals were used in an excisional wound healing model. Although most mammalian leukocytes express α-defensins (human, rabbit, rat, and hamster), mouse leukocytes do not express α-defensins. Therefore, β-defensin expression in these mouse models was focused on. Treatment of cutaneous wounds with a dried form of sNAG, a thin biodegradable membrane, for three days results in a statistically significant increase in β-defensin 3 expression in keratinocytes of wild type animals (FIG. 9A). Involucrin (Watt, F. M., 1983, J Invest Dermatol. 81(1 Suppl): 100s-3s) staining (red) was used to mark the keratinocyte cell layers and show that the expression of β-defensin 3 is confined to the epidermal layer. To assess if sNAG-dependent defensin expression is dependent on Akt1, a similar assay was performed using an Akt1 null animal model. Wounds from Akt1 null mice treated with sNAG membranes show a markedly reduced induction of β-defensin 3 expression (FIG. 9A). To better visualize the epidermal layers that are expressing β-defensin 3, FIG. 9B shows a representative image of a sNAG treated wild type wound harvested on day 3. sNAG treatment of cutaneous wounds induced β-defensin 3 expression mainly in the suprabasal layers of skin (FIG. 9B). Quantitative analyses shown in FIG. 9C shows an approximate 5-fold increase in β-defensin 3 expression in sNAG treated wild type animals and that Akt1 is required for this increase. 6.2.2.4. sNAG Treatment Increases the Kinetics of Wound Closure in WT Animals Previous results have shown an increased kinetics of wound closure in diabetic mouse models in response to sNAG treatment. sNAGs were tested for a similar affect in wild type animals. Excisional wounds were created in wild type animals which were either treated with the membrane form of sNAG or left untreated. Tissue sections were taken at 1, 3 and 5 days post wounding and subjected to H&E staining. As shown in FIG. 10, sNAG treatment of wild type wounds results in complete closure, as visualized by the solid line, at day 3 post wounding. This occurs two days earlier than in the control wounds. Akt1 null animals display a delay in wound closure; these animals do not fully close the wound until 7 days post wounding. The delay in wound closure in the Akt1 null animals is not rescued by sNAG treatment (data not shown). These findings suggest that sNAG not only induces defensin expression but also increases wound healing kinetics in wild type mice and may be a novel and effective therapeutic. 6.2.2.5. sNAG is an Effective Antimicrobial Against S. Aureus Defensin peptides are known to possess antimicrobial properties that are active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Since treatment of endothelial cells with sNAG increases defensin expression (both α- and β-type) and treatment of cutaneous wounds with sNAG dramatically increases β-defensin 3 expression in vivo, the antimicrobial efficacy of sNAG treatment in bacterially infected wounds was assessed. To determine if sNAG decreases bacterial load in cutaneous wounds, wild type and Akt1 null animals were subjected to cutaneous wound healing, followed by infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Infected wounds were either treated with sNAG or left untreated for 3 and 5 days post infection. As shown by the tissue gram staining in FIGS. 11A and 11B, wild type animals treated with sNAG show a significant reduction in gram positive staining by day 5 post wounding as compared with untreated wounds. In contrast, gram stained tissue derived from untreated wounds in Akt1 null animals at 5 days post wounding show an accumulation of neutrophils which stain gram positive (FIG. 11B), indicating a potential lack of bacterial clearance in these animals that is not rescued by sNAG treatment. These findings suggest that Akt1 null animals have a defect in immune clearance mechanisms which is not rescued by sNAG treatment. To quantitate sNAG-specific bacterial changes in colony forming units (CFU), infected wounds from both wild type and Akt1 null mice either sNAG treated or untreated were harvested and cultured. As shown in FIG. 11C, at 5 days post wounding bacterial number is markedly reduced (10-fold) in wild type animals treated with sNAG. However, although the number of bacteria detected in the Akt1 null animals is reduced in comparison to wild type, sNAG treatment had a little effect on absolute bacterial number in the Akt1 null animals. At 3 days post-infection (FIG. 11D), there is a similar 10-fold decrease in CFU in sNAG treated wild type mice as compared to untreated controls. The sNAG treated Akt1 null animals show a 2-fold decrease in CFU as compared to untreated Akt1 null animals. In general, the Akt1 null animals have a lower bacterial load per wound which may be reflective of an Akt1-dependent effect on other processes in addition to defensin expression. These findings suggest that sNAG treatment results in a marked reduction in bacterial load in infected cutaneous wounds in wild type mice but not in Akt1 null mice, suggesting the possibility that defensins are mediating the anti-bacterial response. To show that the antibacterial effect of sNAG treatment is not due to a direct effect of the nanofibers on bacterial growth or on their survival, S. aureus bacterial cultures were treated in solution with different amounts of sNAG, for 3 hours and colony forming units were determined. As shown in FIG. 11E, sNAG treatment had no direct effect on the growth of S. aureus, indicating that sNAG is not directly inhibiting bacterial growth and may then be working via the up-regulation of defensins. 6.2.2.6. Application of Defensin Peptide Mimics the sNAG Antibacterial Effect To determine whether addition of defensin peptide can block bacterial infection similarly to that shown for sNAG treatment, wild type mice were wounded and inoculated with S. aureus as described above and then treated with biologically active human β-defensin 3 peptide (1.0 μm) for three days. Tissue biopsies were stained using a tissue gram stain and CFU was quantitated. FIG. 11 F-G shows the results of these experiments. Infected mice treated with β-defensin 3 peptide have a decreased bacterial load, an approximate 7.5 fold decrease in viable bacteria (FIG. 11G), similar to that shown in wild type mice treated with sNAG. One of the mechanisms by which defensin expression is induced is through stimulation by bacterial LPS, possibly through the activation of Toll like receptors. (Selsted, M. E. and A. J. Ouellette, 2005, Nat Immunol. 6(6):551-7.) To test whether bacterial infection alone is able to induce β-defensin expression within the time periods tested, expression of β-defensin was assessed in infected wounds from wild type animals after three days post wounding. As shown in FIG. 12A, bacterial infection alone does not induce the expression of β-defensin within 3 days of infection, as is shown with sNAG treatment. However, in wild type animals, sNAG treatment of infected wounds causes approximate 3- to 5-fold increase in the expression of β-defensin within a similar time period (FIG. 12B). These findings suggest that sNAG treatment rapidly induces the expression of defensin expression resulting in marked bacterial clearance in S. aureus infected wounds. 6.2.2.7. Antibodies Directed Against β-Defensin 3 Block the Antibacterial Effect of sNAG Since defensins are secreted proteins, the inventors hypothesized that antibodies directed against β-defensin 3 may be able to block the antibacterial activities. To test this hypothesis, wounds were created, infected with S. aureus and treated with sNAG as described above. The wounds were either treated with a β-defensin 3 antibody or an isotype control; one application each day for three days. Wound sections were obtained and stained for gram positive bacteria. As shown in FIG. 13A, sections derived from wounds treated with β-defensin antibody have more gram positive bacteria than those treated with isotype control antibodies. Each section shown was derived from the wound area directly under the scab. Quantitation of CFU in these wounds shows that neutralization of β-defensin 3 prior to sNAG treatment in S. aureus infected wounds results in a significant increase in bacteria. Animals that were treated with an IgG isotype control show an approximate 5-fold reduction in viable bacteria (FIG. 13B). Taken together, these results suggest that sNAG treatment not only results in the increased kinetics of wound healing but also promotes an endogenous anti-bacterial response and supports the use of this nanofiber as novel therapy to enhance wound healing while concurrently decreasing wound infection. 6.2.3 Conclusions The findings presented here demonstrate that a marine diatom derived nanofiber, sNAG, may be used as a novel and effective method to enhance wound healing while concurrently decreasing wound infection. The data demonstrates that this FDA approved material, which is presently used for hemostasis, stimulates the expression of both α-type and β-type defensins in primary endothelial cells and an up-regulation of the β-type in primary keratinocytes. Defensins are an essential component of the innate immune system. These peptides possess anti-microbial properties that are active against gram-positive and negative bacteria, fungi, and many viruses. Defensins are small (3-4 kDa), cysteine-rich cationic peptides found in mammals, insects, and plants that are classified into different families (α, β, and θ) based on their pattern of disulfide bonding. α-defensins are thought to be specific to neutrophils, are found in very high concentrations (comprising approximately 5-7% of the total cellular protein) (Ganz, T. and R. I. Lehrer, 1994, Curr Opin Immunol. 6(4):584-9), and are secreted during anti-microbial responses (Ganz, T., 1987, Infect Immun. 55(3):568-71). It has also been shown that rabbit alveolar macrophages possess α-defensins in levels comparable to rabbit neutrophils. (Ganz, T., et al., 1989, J Immunol. 143(4):1358-65.) β-defensins are found in epithelial cell types such as keratinocytes, mucosal epithelial cells (Harder, J., et al., 1997, Nature 387(6636):861; and Harder. J., et al., 2001. J Biol Chem. 276(8):5707-13), oral cavity tissues and salivary secretions (Mathews, M., et al., 1999, Infect Immun. 67(6):2740-5), and kidney where they can be up-regulated in response to infectious or inflammatory stimuli (Ganz, T. and R. I. Lehrer, 1994, Curr Opin Immunol. 6(4):584-9). Human β-defensin 1 (hDEFB1) is one of the most important antimicrobial peptides in epithelial tissues. Defensin expression and secretion could be extremely important for creating wound therapeutics. The anti-microbial action by defensins is considered part of innate immunity and is non-specific and broad spectrum. Therefore acquired bacterial resistance, as seen with the overuse of antibiotics, is not an issue. The data presented here also demonstrate that both in vitro and in vivo Akt1 is required for defensin expression. sNAG treatment decreases Staph aureus infection of cutaneous wounds in wild type control animals but not in similarly treated Akt1 null animals. It is also important to note that sNAG stimulation of wild type cutaneous wounds results in an increased kinetics of wound closure. Antibody blockade of β-defensin results in a reduction in the sNAG-antibacterial activity. Taken together these findings suggest a central role for Akt1 in the regulation of defensin expression that is responsible for the clearance of bacterial infection and that sNAG treatment activates these pathways in wild type animals. The data that suggests that sNAG treatment of infected wounds could drastically decrease bacterial load in patients, at least in part, by the induction of defensin expression. Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium frequently found colonizing the skin and in the nose. It is still a common cause of nosocomial infections, often causing postsurgical wound infections. S. aureus infections in hospitals have plagued healthcare workers for years and the widespread usage of antibiotics for treatment has lead to antibiotic resistant strains. The data presented herein shows that treatment of Staph infected wounds with sNAG dramatically decreased the bacterial load. For example, the lack of dark purple gram staining in the treated WT mice in FIGS. 11A and 11B indicates that the S. aureus infection has been cleared from these wounds. Both the in vitro and in vivo data provides strong evidence for the use of Taliderm/sNAG in the treatment of wounds to decrease bacterial infection and therefore enhance wound healing. Control experiments indicate that the antibacterial effect of sNAG is not due to a direct interaction of the material with the bacteria but is due to downstream affects such as the regulation of defensins by Akt1 activation. It is widely accepted that defensins are important players in innate immunity and function in antimicrobial activities. Most of the evidence for their function is the direct killing of bacteria by in vitro mixing experiments with purified defensin peptides (Selsted, M. E. and A. J. Ouellette, 2005, Nat Immunol. 6(6):551-7) or in similar experiments as shown in FIG. 11 with direct application of the purified active peptide. The data here show that an induction of defensin expression in wild type animals using a topical application of sNAG results in an antibacterial response. It has recently been shown that transgenic mouse models expressing the human defensin 5 gene are resistant to S. typhimurium, an infection that results in death of wild-type animals (Salzman, N. H., et al., 2003, Nature 422(6931):522-6) again suggesting the importance of defensins in the regulation of the antimicrobial response. It has been accepted that the α-subtype of defensins are specifically expressed in neutrophils, whereas the β-type defensins are epithelial in origin. β-type defensin expression induced in response to sNAG in human keratinocytes both in culture and in the cutaneous wound healing model was detected. The in vivo data illustrates that β-defensin 3 is mainly expressed in the suprabasal layers after treatment with sNAG. This is consistent with previous data which localized human β-defensin 2 to the spinous and granular layers of the skin. (Oren, A., et al., 2003, Exp Mol Pathol. 74(2):180-2.) The skin is in constant contact with injury and infection and functions not only as a mechanical barrier but also maintains the ability to mount an active defense against infection. The expression of β-defensin in the outer layers of skin supports their role in cutaneous innate immunity. However, the data show that sNAG specifically stimulates the expression of three different α-defensins (1, 4 and 5) in endothelial cells. This is shown by RT-PCR, gene array analysis, immunofluorescence and ELISA (data not shown). The interaction between endothelial cells and leukocytes in tissue repair is one of the initial and most important steps in wound healing. The process of extravasation of leukocytes from the vasculature is initiated by chemotactic factors, therefore; it is interesting that α-defensins are induced by sNAG and may contribute to the necessary neutrophil/endothelial cellular interactions. More recently, it has come to light that defensins exhibit biological activities beyond the inhibition of microbial cells, including their contribution to the adaptive immune response by exhibiting chemotactic activity on dendritic (Hubert, P., et al., 2007, FASEB J. 21(11):2765-75) and T cells, monocytes, and macrophages (Garcia, J. R., et al., 2001, Cell Tissue Res. 306(2):257-64) and keratinocytes (Niyonsaba, F., et al., 2007, J Invest Dermatol. 127(3):594-604). Previous work shows that human beta defensins 1 and 2 have the ability to chemoattract immature dendritic cells and T cells through the CC-chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) (Yang, D., et al., 1999, Science 286(5439):525-8), and that human beta defensin 2 can chemoattract TNFα treated neutrophils via the CCR6 receptor (Niyonsaba, F., H. Ogawa, and I. Nagaoka, 2004, Immunology 111(3):273-81). Human β-defensin 2 and 3 have also been shown to induce chemotaxis by interacting with CCR2, a receptor expressed on macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils. (Rohrl, J., et al., 2010, J Immunol, 2010.) Interestingly, the data show that sNAG treatment induces both α and β-defensin expression in endothelial cells. Taken together, the recent data suggest that defensins may mediate wound healing not only by their antimicrobial properties, but also by being chemotactic for other cell types necessary for proper healing. However, application of β-defensin 3 alone did not result in an increase in wound closure (data not shown) implying that topical application of a single defensin does not sustain the cellular interactions required for increased chemo attraction, cellular recruitment and wound closure. The in vivo data using both wild type and Akt1 knockout animals confirms the requirement for Akt1 in sNAG-induced β-defensin 3 expression. Since mouse leukocytes do not express α-defensins like most other mammalian leukocytes (Ganz, T., 2004, C R Biol. 327(6):539-49) in vivo α-defensin staining of infiltrating immune cells was not possible. Treatment of airway epithelial cells in vitro with alpha defensins 1-3 causes a dose and time-dependent increased cell migration that requires activation of PI3K and MAPK pathways. (Aarbiou, J., et al., 2004, Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 30(2):193-201.) sNAG stimulation of endothelial cells has been shown to result in the activation of MAPK (Vournakis, J. N., et al., 2008, J Vase Res. 45(3):222-32) and in data presented here, pharmacological inhibition of MEK also inhibits the expression of the defensins in vitro. These findings suggest that both pathways impinge on the regulation of defensin expression by sNAG, however, Akt1 ablation results in a marked reduction of its expression both in vitro and in vivo. In myeloid cells, β-defensin 1 expression is controlled at the level of transcription, in part, by the Ets-family member PU.1. (Yaneva, M., et al., 2006, J Immunol. 176(11):6906-17; and Ma, Y., Q. Su, and P. Tempst, 1998, J Biol Chem. 273(15):8727-40.) PU.1 is a downstream target of Akt1 in the B-cell lineage. (Rieske, P. and J. M. Pongubala, 2001, J Biol Chem. 276(11):8460-8.) In primary endothelial cells it has been shown that Akt1 is upstream of Ets1 both in vitro and in vivo during Drosophila tracheal development. (Lavenburg, K. R., et al., 2003, FASEB J. 17(15):2278-80.) sNAG stimulation of endothelial cells results in increased expression of Ets1 (probably through Akt1) which is required for the migration of endothelial cells. (Vournakis, J. N., et al., 2008, J Vasc Res. 45(3):222-32.) Thus far, sNAG treatment has resulted in a series of downstream activities; hemostasis, cell migration, cell proliferation, increased wound closure, and as described here, stimulation of the innate immune response resulting in anti-bacterial functions. Given the dramatic increase of diabetic patients within the population who present with chronic wounds and complications due to wound infection, new clinical treatments are in high demand. Here, marine derived pGlcNAc nanofibers are described that not only increase the kinetics of wound healing but act to stimulate innate immunity thus providing anti-bacterial activity. The obvious importance of these observations is the application to nosocomial infections. Of the nosocomial infections, surgical wound infections predominate; with statistics showing up to 8% of all surgical patients. The direct cost of these types of infections is approximately 4.5 billion dollars per year. Given that defensins are part of the innate immune system, activation of these pathways will preclude the generation of resistant organisms as well as allow for the antibiotic-independent clearance of bacterial infection. Use of sNAG in a hospital setting would defray much of the cost and markedly reduce the production of antibiotic resistant species. Taken together, these findings suggest that these marine derived pGlcNAc nanofibers will be highly beneficial in the clinical arena. 6.3 Example 3 sNAG is an Effective Antimicrobial Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa This example demonstrates that sNAG nanofibers have an anti-bacterial effect against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vivo. Materials and Methods: Wild Type C57Bl/6 male mice between 8-12 weeks old were wounded created using a 4 mm biopsy punch (Miltex), to create two identical wounds on each flank. Mice were anesthetized using an O2/Isoflurane vaporizing anesthesia machine (VetEquip, Inc.). Isoflurane was used at 4% for induction; 2% for surgery. Prior to surgery hair was removed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa were picked and cultured overnight at 37° and adjusted to an absorbance of OD600=0.53. Each wound was inoculated with 1.5×109 cfu/wound of P. aeruginosa. After 30 minutes post inoculation, wounds were either treated with sNAG membrane moistened with distilled water (test group, n=6) or left untreated (control group, n=6). On day 3 animals were euthanized and entire wounds were harvested including the surrounding skin using an 8 mm biopsy punch (Miltex). One wound per animal was fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4° C.°, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned for analysis, and the other wound was cultured and plated on LB media without antibiotic for bacterial quantitation. For culturing, wound sections were placed in 0.5 ml bacterial media an incubated for 30 min at 37° C. while shaking. Colony forming units (CFU) were quantitated using a dilution series plated overnight at 37° C. Number of colonies per plate/per dilution were counted and CFU/ml were calculated. Results: The efficacy of sNAG treatment of wounds infected with gram negative bacteria was assessed. As shown in FIG. 14, at 3 days post infection bacterial number is markedly reduced (more than 2 fold) in animals treated with sNAG in comparison to untreated animals. These findings suggest that sNAG treatment results in a marked reduction in bacterial load of gram negative bacteria, and specifically P. aeruginosa, in infected cutaneous wounds (in addition to reduction in bacterial load of gram positive bacteria shown in Example 2). 6.4 Example 4 sNAG Nanofibers Upregulate Expression of a Number of Defensins and Toll Receptor Genes This example demonstrates that a number of defensins and Toll-like receptors are up-regulated by sNAG treatment of human endothelial cells. Materials and Methods: Human Chip probes were printed on epoxy slides. HUVEC cells were cultured as described in section 6.2, and treated with sNAG nanofibers (“sNAG”) for 5 hours. RNA was extracted with RNAsol (Teltest, Inc.) following manufacturer's instructions, amplified using Amino Allyl MessageAMP™ II aRNA amplification kit (Applied Biosystems), and labeled. The slides were prepared for hybridization with aRNA by soaking in blocking solution (Sigma Tris-buffered saline pH8.0, in 1000 ml dH2O, 1% BSAw/v, NaN3 to 0.05%) at RT O/N, then rinsed and dried. Samples containing labeled target aRNA from sNAG-treated cells were hybridized with the slides (65 ul/slide; denatured at 95° C. for 5 min; hybridized for 48 hours at 37° C. in 0.1% SDS and 5×SSC and 1% BSA), rinsed and dried. The slides were scanned and hybridization detected using Perkin-Elmer Scan Array equipment and ScanArray Express software V3.0, updated. To identify up-regulated genes, microarray data was analyzed using Agilent GeneSpring GX v. 11 Bioinformation Data Analysis. Genes of interest analyzed: IL-1, CEACAM3, SPAG11, defensins (“DEFA”=α-defensin, and “DEFB”=β-defensin); Toll-like receptors (“TLR”), SIGIRR (Single IG IL-1-related receptor), and TRAF6 (TNF receptor associated factor 6). Positive controls: 1433Z (Tyrosine-3-monohydrogenase/tryptophan 5 monohydrogenase actition protein); GAPD (glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase); RPL13A (Ribosomal protein L13a); UBC (Ubiquitin C); ACTB (Actin B). Results: Results of the microarray gene chip analyses and Q-PCR validation of microarray results are presented in Tables II-VI below. Using a custom gene chip it was determined that a number of defensins and Toll-like receptors are up-regulated by sNAG treatment of human endothelial cells. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are highly conserved receptors that recognize specific molecular patterns of bacterial components leading to activation of innate immunity. Interestingly, Drosophila lack an adaptive immune system but are still resistant to microbial infections. (Imler, J. L. and J. A. Hoffmann, 2000, Curr Opin Microbiol, 3(1): 16-22.) This host defense is the result of an innate immune system that provides protection by synthesizing the antimicrobial peptides dToll and 18-wheeler which are induced by TLRs. (Lemaitre, B., et al., 1996, Cell 86(6):973-83; and Williams, M. J., et al., 1997, EMBO J. 16(20):6120-30.) Recent work has also linked human defensin expression to TLR activation. Human β-defensin 2 was shown to be induced in airway epithelial cells in a TLR-2 dependent manner. (Hertz, C. J., et al., 2003, J Immunol. 171(12): p. 6820-6.) Toll-like receptor 4 has been shown to mediate human β-defensin 2 inductions in response to Chlamydia pneumonia in monocytes. (Romano Carratelli, C., et al., 2009, FEMS Immunol Med Microbiol. 57(2):116-24.) Importantly, the PI3K/Akt pathway is a key component in TLR signal transduction, controlling cellular responses to pathogens. (Weichhart, T. and M. D. Saemann, 2008, Ann Rheum Dis. 67 Suppl 3:iii70-4.) Since it is known that stimulation of TLRs can lead to increased defensin synthesis, this work suggests the potential for sNAG as a stimulator of innate immunity and bacterial clearance via the activation of Akt1.

Materials and Methods: Human Defensin Chip probes (concentration: 20 uM, quantity 18-20, solvent: SSC based spotting buffer) were printed on epoxy slides using standard techniques. HUVEC and HaCat cells were cultured as described in section 6.2, and treated with either long fibers (“LNAG”) or sNAG nanofibers (“sNAG”), for 2 hours or 20 hours. RNA was extracted with RNAsol (Teltest, Inc.) following manufacturer's instructions, and amplified using Amino Allyl MessageAMP™ II aRNA amplification kit (Applied Biosystems). During RNA amplification, aRNA from cells treated with LNAG and aRNA from cells treated with sNAG was differentially labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescent dyes. The slides were prepared for hybridization with aRNA by soaking in blocking solution (Sigma Tris-buffered saline pH8.0, in 1000 ml dH2O, 1% BSAw/v, NaN3 to 0.05%) at RT O/N, then rinsed and dried. Samples containing equal amounts of differentially labeled target aRNA from LNAG and sNAG-treated cells were mixed, hybridized with the slides (65 ul/slide; denatured at 95° C. for 5 min; hybridized for 48 hours at 37° C. in 0.1% SDS and 5×SSC and 1% BSA), rinsed and dried.

Negative controls: three random sequences (1, 2, 3). Positive controls: 1433Z (Tyrosine-3-monohydrogenase/tryptophan 5 monohydrogenase actition protein); GAPD (glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase); RPL13A (Ribosomal protein L13a); UBC (Ubiquitin C); ACTB (Actin B). Results: Results of the microarray gene chip analyses are presented in Tables VIII and IX below. Table VIII shows gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (“HUVEC”) after 2 h or 24 h exposure to either LNAG fibers or sNAG nanofibers. Table IX shows gene expression in human keratinocyte cell line (HaCat) after 2 h or 24 h exposure to either LNAG fibers or sNAG nanofibers. The results demonstrate that gene expression profile induced by long poly-N-acetylglucosamine fibers (“LNAG”) differs from the gene expression profile induced by sNAG nanofibers (“sNAG”). Specifically, LNAG and sNAG differ in their effect on expression of defensin genes and Toll receptor genes.

The sNAG membrane is derived form microalgal pGlcNAc fibers produced as previously described (see Vournakis et al. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,623,064; and 5,624,679, the content of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Briefly, microalgae were cultured in unique bioreactor conditions using a defined growth media. Following the harvest of microalgae from high-density cultures, fibers were isolated via a stepwise separation and purification process resulting in batches of pure fibers suspended in water for injections (wfi). Fibers were formulated into patches by concentration and oven drying, and were packaged and sterilized by gamma-irradiation. Fiber dimensions average 20-50 nm×1-2 nm×˜100 μm. Batches of fibers were individually quality controlled using chemical and physical test parameters, and each batch met strict purity criteria prior to release. Final batches were required to be substantially free of proteins, metal ions, and other components. The fibers were then shortened by irradiation to produce sNAG membranes. Briefly, the starting material contained 60 g of pGlcNAc slurry at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. The concentration of the pGlcNAc slurry was confirmed by filtering 5 mL into a 0.2 um filter. 15 L of pGlcNAc slurry containing 15 g pGlcNAc was filtered until formation of a wet cake. The wake cake was then transferred into a foil pouch, which is a gamma radiation compatible container, and subjected to 200 kGy gamma radiation. Other irradiation conditions were tested for their effects on pGlcNAc compositions, as reflected in FIG. 15A. Effect of Irradiation on pGlcNAc Membranes. While irradiation reduces the molecular weight of pGlcNAc, irradiation did not disturb the microstructure of the fibers. pGlcNAc was irradiated under different conditions: as a dry, lyophilized material; as a dry membrane; as a concentrated slurry (30:70 weight by volume); and as a dilute slurry (5 mg/ml). A suitable molecular weight reduction (to a molecular weight of 500,000-1,000,000 daltons) was achieved at an irradiation dose of 1,000 kgy for dry polymer, and 200 kgy for wet polymer (FIG. 15A). The chemical and physical structure of the fibers was maintained throughout irradiation as verified by infrared (IR) spectrum (FIG. 15B), elemental assay, and scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) analysis. Microscopic observation of irradiated fibers showed a decrease in the particle length (FIGS. 15C and 15D). The majority of the fibers are less than about 15 μm in length, with an average length of about 4 um. 6.7 Example 7 sNAG Nanofibers and Lone Form p-GlcNAc Fibers Differ in their Effects on Metabolic Rate and Serum Deprivation of Umbilical Cord Vein Endothelial Cells Materials and Methods. Pooled, multiple-donor human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (EC) (Cambrex) were maintained at 37° C. with 5% CO2 in endothelial basal medium 2 (Cambrex) supplemented with EC growth medium 2 SingleQuots as described by Cambrex procedures. Serum starvation was performed at 80-90% confluency in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum (Gibco BRL) for 24 h followed by stimulation with VEGF 165 (20 ng/ml, R&D Systems) or with highly purified pGlcNAc nanofibers or sNAG nanofibers in sterile water (provided by Marine Polymer Technologies, Inc., Danvers, Mass., USA) with the amounts indicated in the figure descriptions. For cellular proliferation/viability assessment, 2 different assays were used: trypan blue exclusion by direct cell counts using a hemacytometer and an MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay in procedures described by the manufacturer (Promega). Results—pGlcNAc: pGlcNAc Did not Affect Metabolic Rate. As shown in FIG. 16, pGlcNAc did not result in a higher metabolic rate as measured by MTT assays, indicating that this polymeric material was not causing marked increases in cellular proliferation. pGlcNAc Protected EC from Cell Death Induced by Serum Starvation. To test if pGlcNAc fibers had a direct effect on EC, serum-starved EC cells were treated with VEGF or with different concentrations of pGlcNAc fibers. As shown in FIG. 17 at 48 h and 72 h after serum starvation, as compared with the total number of cells plated (control), there was about 2-fold reduction in the number of cells after 48 h or 72 h. At 48 h, this decrease in cell number was rescued by the addition of VEGF or by the addition of pGlcNAc fibers at either 50 or 100 μg/ml. At 72 h, the decrease in cell number was rescued by the addition of VEGF or largely rescued by the addition of pGlcNAc fibers at 100 μg/ml. These results indicated that like VEGF, pGlcNAc fiber treatment prevented cell death induced by serum deprivation. Results—sNAG: sNAG Induced Marked Increase in Metabolic Rate. As measured by MTT assays, sNAG at 50, 100 or 200 μg/ml resulted in a higher metabolic rate of EC than VEGF (FIG. 18). sNAG Did not Protect EC from Cell Death Induced by Serum Deprivation. To test if sNAG fibers had a direct effect on EC, serum-starved EC cells were treated with VEGF or with different concentrations of sNAG fibers. As shown in FIG. 19, at 48 h after serum starvation, as compared with the total number of cells plated (control), there was about 2-fold reduction in the number of cells. This decrease in cell number was rescued by the addition of VEGF but not by the addition of sNAG fibers at 50, 100 or 200 μg/ml. These results indicated that not like VEGF, sNAG fiber treatment did not prevent cell death induced by serum deprivation. Conclusion: The above results demonstrate that sNAG, unlike long form pGlcNAc, increases the metabolic rate of serum-starved EC in a MTT assay and does not rescue apoptosis of serum-starved EC in a trypan blue exclusion test. 6.8 Example 8 Preclinical Testing of sNAG 6.8.1 Test Article A test article comprising sNAG produced as previously described in Section 6.2.1 supra. was utilized. The test article was supplied sterile by Marine Polymer Technologies, Inc. 6.8.2 Biocompatibility Testing—L929 MEM Elusion Test—ISO 10993-5 Biocompatibility of the test article was tested in mouse fibroblast L929 mammalian cells. No biological reactivity (Grade 0) was observed in the L929 cells at 48 hours, post exposure to the test article. The observed cellular response obtained from the positive control article (Grade 4) and negative control article (Grade 0) confirmed the suitability of the test system. Based on the criteria of the protocol, the test article is considered non-toxic and meets the requirements of the Elution Test, International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 10993-5 guidelines. See Table X below.

Materials and Methods To evaluate the potential of the test article to induce local toxic effects, the Intramuscular Implantation Test—ISO—4 Week Implantation (“Intramuscular Implantation Test”) was used. Briefly, the test article was implanted in the paravertebral muscle tissue of New Zealand White rabbits for a period of 4 weeks. The test article was then evaluated separately using two control articles: positive control Surgicel (Johnson and Johnson, NJ) and negative control High Density Polyethylene (Negative Control Plastic). Preparation of Test and Control Articles. The test article measured approximately 1 mm to in width and 10 mm in length. The two control articles were prepared. The positive control, Surgicel (C1), measured approximately 1 mm in width by 10 mm in length and was received sterile. Negative Control Plastic (C2), measured approximately 1 mm in width by 10 mm in length and was sterilized by dipping in 70% ethanol. Pre-Dose Procedure. Each animal was weighed prior to implantation. On the day of the test, the dorsal sides of the animals were clipped free of fur and loose hair was removed by means of a vacuum. Each animal was appropriately anesthetized. Prior to implantation, the area was swabbed with a surgical preparation solution. Dose Administration. Four test article strips were surgically implanted into each of the paravertebral muscles of each rabbit, approximately 2.5 cm from the midline and parallel to the spinal column and approximately 2.5 cm from each other. The test article strips were implanted on one side of the spine. In a similar fashion, positive control article strips (Surgicel) were implanted in the contralateral muscle of each animal. Two negative control strips (Negative Control Plastic) were implanted caudal (toward the tail) to the test article and to C1 control implant sites on either side of the spine (total of four strips). A total of at least eight test article strips and eight of each control article strips are required for evaluation. Post-Dose Procedures. The animals were maintained for a period of 4 weeks. The animals were observed daily for this period to ensure proper healing of the implant sites and for clinical signs of toxicity. Observations included all clinical manifestations. At the end of the observation period, the animals were weighed. Each animal was sacrificed by an injectable barbiturate. Sufficient time was allowed to elapse for the tissue to be cut without bleeding. Gross Observations. The paravertebral muscles in which the test or control articles were implanted were excised in toto from each animal. The muscle tissue was removed by carefully slicing around the implant sites with a scalpel and lifting out the tissue. The excised implant tissues were examined grossly, but without using excessive invasive procedures that might have disrupted the integrity of this tissue for histopathological evaluation. The tissues were placed in properly labeled containers containing 10% neutral buffered formalin. Histopathology. Following fixation in formalin, each of the implant sites was excised from the larger mass of tissue. The implant site, containing the implanted material, was examined macroscopically. Each site was examined for signs of inflammation, encapsulation, hemorrhaging, necrosis, and discoloration using the following scale: 0=Normal1=Mild2=Moderate3=Marked After macroscopic observation, the implant material was left in-situ and a slice of tissue containing the implant site was processed. Histologic slides of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections were prepared by Toxikon. The slides were evaluated and graded by light microscopic examination. Pathological Assessment of the Effects of the Implant. The following categories of biological reaction were assessed by microscopic observation for each implant site: 1. Inflammatory Responses: a. Polymorphonuclear leukocytesb. Lymphocytesc. Eosinophilsd. Plasma cellse. Macrophagesf. Giant cellsg. Necrosish. Degeneration2. Healing Responses: a. Fibrosisb. Fatty Infiltrate Each category of response was graded using the following scale: 0=Normal0.5=Very Slight1=Mild2=Moderate3=Marked The relative size of the involved area was scored by assessing the width of the area from the implant/tissue interface to unaffected areas which have the characteristics of normal tissue and normal vascularity. Relative size of the involved area was scored using the following scale: 0=0 mm, No site0.5=up to 0.5 mm, Very slight1=0.6-1.0 mm, Mild2=1.1-2.0 mm, Moderate3=>2.0 mm, Marked The Intramuscular Implantation Test was conducted based upon the following REFERENCES 1. ISO 10993-6, 1994, Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices—Part 6: Tests for Local Effects After Implantation. 2. ISO 10993-12, 2002, Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices—Part 12: Sample Preparation and Reference Materials. 3.

ASTM F763-04, 2004, Standard Practice for Short Term Screening of Implant Materials. 5. ISO/IEC 17025, 2005, General Requirements for the Competence of Testing and Calibration Laboratories. The results of the Intramuscular Implantation Test were evaluated based upon the following criteria: 1. Calculated Rating: For each implanted site, a total score is determined. The average score of the test sites for each animal is compared to the average score of the control sites for that animal. The average difference between test and control sites for all animals is calculated and the initial Bioreactivity Rating is assigned as follows: 0-1.5 No Reaction*>1.5-3.5 Mild Reaction>3.5-6.0 Moderate Reaction>6.0 Marked Reaction* A negative calculation is reported as zero (0). 2. Modification of the Rating: The pathology observer reviews the calculated level of bioreactivity. Based on the observation of all factors (e.g., relative size, pattern of response, inflammatory vs. resolution), the pathology observer may revise the Bioreactivity Rating. Justification for the modification to the rating is presented in the narrative report (A descriptive narrative report regarding the biocompatibility of the test material is provided by the pathology observer). 6.8.3.2. Results The results indicated that the test article was non-reactive when implanted for 4 weeks (Bioreactivity Rating of 0.2) when compared to positive control Surgicel; and non-reactive (Bioreactivity Rating of 0.0) when compared to negative control High Density Polyethylene (Negative Control Plastic). Clinical Observation. Table XI below shows results of the macroscopic evaluation of the test article and control implant sites indicated no significant signs of inflammation, encapsulation, hemorrhage, necrosis, or discoloration at the 4 week time period. Some test sites and the majority of the positive control, Surgicel, were not seen macroscopically and serial sections were submitted for microscopic evaluation.

Table XII below shows results of the microscopic evaluation of the test article implant sites indicated no significant signs of inflammation, fibrosis, hemorrhage, necrosis, or degeneration as compared to each of the control article sites. The Bioreactivity Rating for the 4 week time period (average of three animals) was 0.2, (C1—Surgicel) and 0.0 (C2—Negative Control Plastic) indicating no reaction as compared to either of the control implant sites. The pathologist noted there was a moderate polymorphic and histiocytic (macrophages) infiltrate around the in situ test article that was not unexpected given the nature of the test material.
