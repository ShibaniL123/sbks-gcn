A STORAGE CONTAINER FOR AN ENDOSCOPE The present invention relates to a storage container for a medical instrument and in particular to a container for the storage and transport of a flexible endoscope. Medical instruments such as endoscopes are exposed during use to bodily substances such as blood, mucus, saliva, and faeces. Microorganisms present in these bodily substances can lead to infection of another patient, and their contact with the reusable endoscope represents a risk of cross infection. Instruments must therefore be processed prior to any procedure to remove such microorganisms and prevent infection during use. Conventional high temperature, high pressure sterilisation techniques in which heat and pressure is used to destroy microorganisms are not suitable for flexible endoscopes which would be damaged by the high temperatures required. As such, lower temperature disinfectant techniques are used to remove microorganisms from a flexible endoscope. A typical post use cleaning operation involves an endoscope being flushed in situ at the bedside immediately following use with a detergent to remove the bulk of the debris present on the endoscope and to inhibit the short term formation and surface anchoring of biofilm. The endoscope is then transferred to a decontamination suite where a manual cleaning operation is initially performed in which the endoscope is submerged in a cleaning liquid and channels of the endoscope, referred to as lumens, are individually brushed clean. The lumens of the endoscope are then channel flushed with a measured dose of detergent being passed through each of the lumen. The endoscope is then transferred to an Automatic Washer Disinfector (AWD), where it undergoes further channel flushing and exterior washing. After the AWD cycle is complete the machine completes a preliminary drying stage partially removing bulk water. Following this stage the endoscope is considered to be disinfected to an acceptable level. However, some water remains resident on the endoscope, and in particular within the lumens. The presence of water provides a growth site for biofilm. As such, with water remaining resident on the endoscope, the endoscope must be used within 3 hours of sterilisation before biofilm growth reaches and unacceptable level. This narrow time window often leads to endoscopes having to be disinfected more than once prior to use, with these repeat decontamination cycles adding undesirable time and cost to the process. Alternatively, the endoscopes may be stored for up to 7 days in a drying and storage cabinet in which dried and filtered air circulates the endoscope as well as being channelled through the lumens. The dry environment prevents microorganism growth by removing water from the environment. A typical cabinet may house around 6 endoscopes. For a hospital requiring around 100 endoscopes the cost of providing a sufficient number of drying and storage cabinets, and running and maintaining the same is prohibitive. In addition the process of installing the endoscopes in the cabinets is labour intensive with up to 8 hose connections being required for each endoscope. A means is also required to transport the endoscopes in a sterile manner from the cabinets to the point of use, while also protecting the endoscope from damage. It has been proposed, for example in European Patent Number 2575666, to place the endoscope in a sealed flexible bag following the disinfecting process. A vacuum is applied to the flexible bag as it is heat sealed to reduce the oxygen level within the bag to a level at which microorganism growth is prevented. It has been found that repeatedly forming a seal on a flexible bag to a level that is compliant with medical standards is extremely difficult due to the problems of constraining a flexible membrane during sealing. As such it cannot be guaranteed that an effective seal is consistently created, and as such seal testing would be required after every sealing operation to verify the integrity of the seal. It has also been found that parts of the flexible bag may seal against the ports of the lumens during the sealing and evacuation process before the vacuum has been completely applied to the bag. As such, as sealed micro environment is created within the lumens in which the oxygen levels are greater than the rest of the bag, allowing microorganism growth to proceed. The sealing and evacuation process has also been shown to place excessive pressure on the endoscope, which can lead due damage. The pressure can also lead to creep of the flexible plastic material of the bag, particularly over tightly radiussed features of the endoscope, which may locally increase the porosity of the bag compromise the oxygen levels within the bag. It is therefore desirable to provide an improved storage container for an endscope which addresses the above described problems and/or which offers improvements generally. According to the present invention there is provided a (4) as described in the accompanying claims. In an embodiment of the invention there is provided a storage container for a medical device such as an endoscope. The storage container comprises a rigid enclosure having an opening configured to receive a medical device for storage. A closure member is configured to close and seal the opening of the enclosure. An outlet valve is also provided that is arranged to enable air to be drawn from the enclosure to create a low oxygen vacuum environment therein and to seal the enclosure to maintain said vacuum while the medical device is stored therein. The container enables a disinfected endoscope to be housed in a vacuum to inhibit microorganism growth, thereby enabling storage without a repeat disinfection cycle for days and week rather than hours. The rigid enclosure maintains its form when the vacuum is applied and as such prevents damage to the endoscope which can occur in flexible vacuum sealing arrangements, as well as providing a hard case to protect the endoscope from external impact damage. The outlet valve arrangement enables the vacuum to be applied in a controlled manner at to be topped up if required following initial priming. This is not possible in flexible heat seal arrangements of the prior art. The outlet valve is preferably a non-return valve. The non-return valve enables the container to be disconnected from a vacuum source and to remain as a stand-alone unit with the vacuum maintained. The rigid enclosure may comprise a base and at least one wall extending from the base having an upper rim defining the opening to the enclosure. The closure member comprises a rigid lid configured to be seated on the upper rim to close and seal the opening. The enclosure may be substantially cylindrical having a circular opening and the lid having a substantially circular shape corresponding to the shape of the opening. The cylindrical wall distributes the pressure forces of the vacuum in an even manner. Preferably the lid has a convex domed shape extending outwardly away from the enclosure in an upwards direction, and the base has a convex domed shape extending outwardly from the enclosure. The domed shape of eth base and lid distributes pressure forces from the lids and base to the side wall to enable the container to withstand significant pressure reduction. The enclosure is preferably configured to receive and support a flexible endoscope in a relaxed coiled state. The lid is preferably configured to be held on the enclosure by the corce of the vacuum alone. An inlet valve is preferably provided that is configured to selectively permit airflow into the container to release said vacuum, to enable the container to be opened at the point of use. The storage container preferably comprises a pressure sensor arranged to detect the pressure within the container, to enable an operator to monitor the integrity of the vacuum. Preferably the container also comprises means arranged to transmit the pressure sensor signal to a receiver external to and remote from the container. A passive RFID tag may be connected to the pressure sensor and configured to transmit a signal indicative of the pressure detected by the sensor. In this way the signal from the pressure sensor may be detected by interrogating the RFID tag, and as such no power supply is required in the container. The pressure sensor and RFID tag are preferably mounted to a mast located within the enclosure to promote signal reception and transmission. In another aspect of the invention there is provided a storage system for a medical device such as an endoscope. The storage system comprises a container as described above having a pressure sensor arranged to detect the pressure within the container and a passive RFID tag connected to the pressure sensor and configured to transmit a signal indicative of the pressure detected by the sensor. An RFID reader is also provided configured and arranged to transmit an interrogation signal to the RFID tag of the container and to receive a signal from the RFID indicative of the pressure detected by the pressure sensor. The storage system may further comprise a controller configured to determine whether the pressure detected by the pressure sensor exceeds a predetermined threshold. The controller is preferably configured to generate an alert signal in the event that the pressure exceeds said threshold. A vacuum source may be provided that is connectable to the outlet valve of the container, and wherein the controller is configured to activate the vacuum supply when connected to the container to apply a vacuum to the container if the pressure exceeds said threshold. The present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the following illustrative figures in which: Figure 1 shows a container according to an embodiment of the invention with the lid removed; and Figure 2 shows a side view container according to an embodiment of the invention with the lid included. Referring to Figure 1, a container 1 for an endoscope 2 comprises a base section 3 having a substantially circular floor 4 and a side wall 6 extending vertically from the floor 4. The side wall 6 extends continuously around the periphery of the floor 4 and is substantially cylindrical in shape. The floor 4 and side wall 6 define a storage volume 8 for receiving the endoscope 2. A removable, disc shaped planar floor 9 is received within the enclosure on which the endoscope 2 is supported. The floor section 9 preferably comprises a grid or mesh structure, or other form of apertures configured to permit liquid form the endoscope to drain into the floor 4 of the container 1. The upper edge 10 of the side wall 6 defines an opening to the container 1 through which the endoscope 2 is placed into the container 1. The floor 4 and side wall 6 are configured to define an enclosure suitable to receive an endoscope 2 in a coiled and unstressed condition, with the endoscope 2 able to rest within the container 1 without contacting the sidewall 6. The circular upper edge 10 of the side wall 6 supports a flexible annular sealing member 12. The annular sealing member 12 is preferably an o-ring seal having a circular cross section such that it is substantially toroidal in shape. The seal 12 is received within a channel formed along the upper edge 10 of the side wall 6. As shown in Figure 2, the floor 4 is convex having a downwardly curving domed shape. A plurality of feet 14 are connected to and extend downwardly from the lower surface of the floor 4. The feet 14 include a flat lower edge 16 and a curved upper edge 18 corresponding to the curved shape of the floor 4 to enable the convex floor 4 to be seated in a stable manner on a flat surface. A lid 20 seats on the upper edge 10 of the side wall 6 to close and seal the container 1. The lid 20 is convex having an upwardly curving donned shape corresponding to the domed shape if the floor 4. The lid 20 includes an annular lower edge 22. A metal ring is bonded to the lower edge 22, and seated within an inner lip defined around the inner periphery of the lower edge 22, such that the lower surface of the metal ring and the lower surface of the lip of the lower edge 22 define the engagement surface 27 for engagement with the floor 4. An outer lip 23 and inner lip 25 extend upwardly around the outer periphery and inner periphery respectively of the upper edge 10 of the side wall 6 defining a channel 29 for receiving the lower edge 22 of the lid 20. The lid 20 is received in the channel 29 and when received seats and seals against the seal 12 that is located within the channel 29, with the seal 12 and the lid 20 being in continuous contact as the lid 20 is secured to the upper rim 10 of the container side wall 6. A valve assembly 24 is secured to the side wall 6. The valve assembly 24 provides two closable ports defining air pathways between the interior and exterior of the container 1. The valve assembly 24 includes an outlet port including a non return check valve, having a quick release female pneumatic coupling configured to receive a corresponding male coupling of a pneumatic vacuum line. The outlet valve is configured to enable air to flow out from the container under the application of a vacuum. The outlet is valve is configured to automatically close when the vacuum connector is removed to retain the vacuum with the container 1. The valve assembly 24 also includes a release inlet valve configured to allow air to flow into the container to release the vacuum within the container 1. The release valve is preferably a push button release valve or similar valve that may be readily accessed and actuated. A pressure monitoring system is provided to monitor the pressure within the container 1, which is indicative of the vacuum level within the container 1. The pressure monitoring system comprises a pressure sensor (not shown) connected to the container 1 that is arranged to detect the pressure within the container 1. Preferably the pressure sensor is an electronic pressure sensor mounted on a printed circuit board. The pressure sensore is located within the container such that it is subject to the internal pressure, and is preferably mounted to the floor 4. A passive RFID tag is connected to the pressure sensor for transmitting data indicative of the detected pressure to a remote RFID Reader. The pressure sensor and RFID tag are preferably mounted on a mast extending from the floor 4, to optimise the signal transmission to and from the RDIF tag. The RFID Reader is preferably located in close proximity to the container 1 to minimise power requirements. A controller is also provided, that is preferably a Programmable Logic Controller or another programmable device. The RFID Reader is controlled to intermittently interrogate the RFID at predetermined intervals, with the controller using the data provided to the RFID Reader to determine and monitor the pressure within the container 1 and to generate a response signal in the event that the pressure rises above a certain predetermined threshold. The response signal may activate be an audible or visual signal to indicate the pressure rise to an operator. Alternatively or in addition the controller may actuate a vacuum pump to return the pressure to the required level. The RFID tag may also be utilise to monitor the location of the container 1. In use, following the prescribed cleaning and disinfectant procedure, the endoscope 2 is placed into the base 3 of the container 1 in a relaxed coiled condition. The lid 20 is then placed onto the floor 4, with the lower edge 22 and the seal 12 forming an initial passive seal. This initial passive seal permitted by the seating and sealing arrangement between the lid 20 and base 3 as described above is such that no further vacuum priming is required. With the lid 20 in place a vacuum source is connected to the outlet of the valve assembly 24. The vacuum source comprises a vacuum pump, hose and a cpc gas connector to enable quick connection and release from the valve assembly. A vacuum is then drawn to 0_abs<p_container<[0.7 ]_(bar absolute). A pressure greater than >0.7 absolute gives a very small tolerance for leaks and has significantly reduced the sealing force on any ο rings or similar. As the vacuum is applied to the container the lid 20 is drawn into greater engagement with the base 3, with the lower edge 22 being forced against the base of the channel 29 and the seal 12, with the seal improving as the vacuum level increases. With the vacuum fully applied the force on the lid is great enough that the lid 20 is held firmly in engagement with the base 3 with no additional catches, locks or securing means being required to hold and retain the lid 4 in position. Approximately 1.2 tonne of pressure is experienced by the container 1. The domed shapes of the lid 20 and floor 4 are configured to resist and evenly distribute the pressure applied to these surfaces through to the side wall 6 to prevent collapse. In the same way, the cylindrical shape of the side wall 6 also distributes the pressure forces around the container 1, removing stress risers that could lead to collapse under vacuum pressure. The shape of the lid 20 also protects the container from external forces applied from above thereby protecting the endoscope contained within. Once the vacuum has been applied to the container 1, with the lid 20 fully sealed, the vacuum hose may be disconnected. The non-return outlet valve is configured such when the vacuum hose is disconnected the flow of air into the container is prevented and the vacuum is maintained. Alternatively, the vacuum pump may be deactivated with the hose remaining connected. In this arrangement the vacuum pump may be reactivated to top up the vacuum if required. As the pressure vacuum is drawn the pressure sensor detects the decrease in pressure. The controller is configured to communicate with the RFID tag and recognises the location of the container 1 to determine that the application of the vacuum is occurring at an authorised station, which will typically be the cleaning station. Location monitoring may comprise the controller communicating with a separate RFID marker fixed at the specified location and/or location monitoring means, which may for example be GPS, provided directly on the container 1. Control software is used to log the endoscope in a database as being cleaned and safe for use. With the container fully sealed and evacuated, the oxygen levels in the container are sufficiently low to prevent microorganism growth. From this point, the container may either be placed in a rack for longer term storage, or transported to a point of use. At the point of use the pressure release switch is activates to release the vacuum from within the container. A cover may be provided over the switch to prevent accidental release, which may be a flexible silicone cover. Once the depressurisation release switch has been actuated, and air has returned into the container 1 the lid may be manually lifted without further device, and the endoscope used. Following use the endoscope may be returned to the chamber in a dirty condition. To limit contamination of the container 1 the endoscope may be placed in a bag to prevent bulk deposits. The bag preferably includes an indicator that the contents are dirty. At this point even if a vacuum is applied to the container (CPC connector should prevent this) the background software will notice that the container has different level of vacuum than was predicted and so it recalls it through screen messages if it is presented to a reader. Should the vacuum be applied to the exact amount expected by the software then the bag indicator, which may be the colour of the bag or just its presence alone, serves as a reminder that the scope is contaminated. A trolley or cart may be provided as part of the storage system that is capable of holding multiple containers 1. The trolley has storage racks and wheels and may be taken indoors/outdoors to the site of the procedures. Built in to the trolley is at least one RFID reader and a series of antennae and a screen. These antennae interrogate the RFID pressure sensor and pass the readings to an on-board computer. The computer is linked to a battery power supply, meaning that the entire cart requires charging from time to time e.g. overnight / daily. The software running in the background senses any sudden change in pressure and at that point records the time that the device ceased to be 'contained'. Should the device see a sudden partial pressure drop then it is likely an adverse event has occurred that should be investigated. This continual monitoring can also diagnose remotely the performance of the device and its seals, constantly evaluating the performance curve. On arrival at the site of the procedure, the desired unit may be placed on a support surface top of the cart, and at this point the RFID reader would establish the identity of the endoscope inside the unit without requiring the container to be opened. The operator would then push the depressurising switch and air would be allowed in to the chamber, possibly through a sterile filter. For long term storage the system may include an immobile racking system capable of holding ten or more endoscope containers 1. The racking unit comprises a display screen, a vacuum pump and required electronics, a series of RFID readers, a series of antennae, and a vacuum supply pipe network capable to connecting to multiple containers 1. Containers 1 are placed onto the rack, and the RFID reader recognises the container 1 through communication with the RFID tag and begins to record the pressure within. The pressure may also be displayed on the screen mounted as part of the storage unit. The user connects the container 1 to the vacuum pump of the storage unit via quick connect gas couplings of the supply pipe network connecting the container 1 to the vacuum supply that forms part of the unit. All containers 1 are interconnected via a vacuum ring main. The containers 1 remain connected during storage. In the event that the RFID Reader detects a loss of vacuum, the vacuum pump may be activated to 'top up' the vacuum in that specific container 1. The pump system is configured such that the pump may not 'over vacuum' the units however long it is left on for. For example, for a design value of 0.25 bar absolute vacuum, a pump of capability 0.2 bar absolute vacuum is selected, allowing enough excess capacity to overcome any non return valves and losses due to pipe work and connections. The container 1 is able to independently maintain the vacuum at a suitable level for a period at least 3 days before the vacuum is topped up, or the endoscope is used. When connected to a top up vacuum source, the containers may safely store the endoscopes for a period of around 30. The vacuum may be released at any time via manual override.
