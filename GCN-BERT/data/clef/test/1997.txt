(E)-3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-7,8-dimethoxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-t etrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
Step 1
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-7,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate
The crude 4-(2-((2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)amino)propyl)benzene-1,2-diol 1d (200 mg, 0.83 mmol) was dissolved in 8 mL of methanol, then (E)-methyl 3-(4-formylphenyl)acrylate 35a (165 mg, 0.87 mmol, prepared by a well-known method disclosed in "Applied Organometallic Chemistry, 2014, 28(7), 529-536") and acetic acid (100 mg, 1.66 mmol) were added. The resulting mixture was heated to 55Â°C and stirred for 5 hours. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove methanol and acetic acid. Dichloromethane was added, and the mixture was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-7,8-dihydroxy-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 35b (100 mg, yield 29%) as a brown oil.
