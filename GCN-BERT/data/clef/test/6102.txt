METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF OCULAR DISEASES AND DISORDERS By Arturo Bravo-Nuevo George C. Prendergast This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/978,061, filed on April 10, 2014. The foregoing application is incorporated by reference herein. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to the field of ocular diseases. Specifically, the invention provides novel compositioas and methods for the treatment of ocular diseases, particularly those characterized by aberrant vascularization. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Eye disease is a significant cause of morbidity in the U.S. and throughout the world. For example, diabetic retinopathy is one of the most common causes of vision loss in the world and age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of blindness in people over 50 in the U.S. While therapies have improved for many eye diseases, there is still a need for methods and compositions for inhibiting or treating eye diseases, particularly those characterized by aberrant vascularization. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with one aspect of the instant invention, methods for inhibiting, treating, and/or preventing an ocular disease in a patient in need thereof are provided. The methods comprise the administration of at least one antibody or antibody fragment immunologically specific for RhoB. In a particular embodiment, the ocular disease is characterized by a lack of blood vessels (avascular pathology) around or near the optic nerve. In a particular embodiment, the ocular disease is characterized by abnormal or aberrant vascularization or neovascularization compared to a normal or healthy individual. In a particular embodiment, the methods comprise the administration of a composition comprising at least one antibody or antibody fragment immunologically specific for RhoB and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a particular embodiment, the methods further comprise the administration of at least one other therapeutic agent or method for treating, inhibiting, or preventing the ocular disease concurrently and/or sequentially with the at least one antibody or antibody fragment immunologically specific for RhoB. Compositions for the inhibition, treatment, and/or prevention of an ocular disease are also provided. The compositions comprise at least one anti-RhoB antibody or antibody fragment and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The composition may further comprise at least one other agent for the treatment, inhibition, or prevention of the ocular disease. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a graph of the avascular pathology around the optic nerve and the abnormal neovascularization of the edge of the retina in mice with oxygen-induced retinopathy treated with either the 7F7 anti-RhoB antibody or a non-specific IgG. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides compositions and methods for the inhibition, prevention, and/or treatment of ocular diseases. The methods comprise administering at least one anti-RhoB antibody or antibody fragment to a subject. In a particular embodiment, the ocular disease is characterized by abnormal/aberrant vascularization. In a particular embodiment the ocular disease is characterized by neovascularization, particularly at or near the edges of the retina. In a particular embodiment, the ocular disease is characterized by a lack of blood vessels (avascular pathology) around or near the optic nerve. Examples of ocular diseases of the instant invention include, without limitation, retinopathy (e.g., retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy (e.g., proliferative diabetic retinopathy)) and macular degeneration (e.g., wet macular degeneration). As used herein, the term "macular degeneration" refers to ocular diseases wherein the macula - a small and highly sensitive part of the retina responsible for detailed central vision - degenerates and/or loses functional activity. The degeneration and/or loss of functional activity may be due to any reason including, without limitation, cell death or apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation, and/or loss of normal biological function. Macular degeneration may be wet (exudative or neovascular) or dry (non-exudative, atrophic or non-neovascular). In a particular embodiment, the instant invention encompasses the treatment of wet macular degeneration. Wet macular degeneration is typically characterized by the formation of new vessels to improve the delivery of blood to oxygen deprived retinal tissue (although the new vessels typically rupture, causing bleeding and damage to surrounding tissue). Examples of macular degeneration diseases include, without limitation, age-related macular degeneration and Sorsby fundus dystrophy. As used herein, the term "diabetic retinopathy" refers to changes in the retina due to microvascular (e.g., retinal and choroidal) changes associated with diabetes. Without being bound by theory, small blood vessels within the retina, which are particularly susceptible to poor blood glucose control, are damaged due to long-term exposure to high levels of blood sugar (hyperglycemia). Diabetic retinopathy may affect one or both eyes, typically both eyes. The term "diabetic retinopathy" encompasses mild, moderate, or severe non-proliferative (simple) diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). In a particular embodiment, the instant invention encompasses the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is typically characterized by the formation of new vessels to improve the delivery of blood to oxygen deprived retinal tissue. As used herein, the term "retinopathy of prematurity", which is also known as Terry syndrome or retrolental fibroplasia, refers to abnormal blood vessel development in the retina of the eye that occurs in infants that are born prematurely. Retinopathy of prematurity is typically characterized by fibrovasc ular proliferation and the growth of abnormal new vessels. As stated hereinabove, the methods (and compositions) of the instant invention comprise administering at least one antibody or antibody fragment which is immunologically specific for RhoB (ras homolog family member B; anti-RhoB antibody) to a subject. In a particular embodiment, the anti-RhoB antibody is immunologically specific for human RhoB. Amino acid and nucleotide sequences of human RhoB are provided in GenBank Accession No. CAA29968 and Gene ID: 388. The antibody may be a naturally occurring antibody or may be a synthetic or modified antibody (e.g., a recombinantly generated antibody; a chimeric antibody; a bispecific antibody; a humanized antibody; a camelid antibody; and the like). The antibody may comprise at least one purification tag. In a particular embodiment, the framework antibody is an antibody fragment. Antibody fragments include, without limitation, immunoglobulin fragments including, without limitation: single domain (Dab; e.g., single variable light or heavy chain domain), Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and F(v); and fusions (e.g., via a linker) of these immunoglobulin fragments including, without limitation: scFv, scFv2, scFv-Fc, minibody, diabody, triabody, and tetrabody. The antibody may also be a protein (e.g., a fusion protein) comprising at least one antibody or antibody fragment. In a particular embodiment of the instant invention, the antibody comprises an Fc region. Examples of anti-RhoB antibodies are provided in WO 2013/023059, which is incorporated herein by reference. In a particular embodiment, the anti-RhoB antibody is immunologically specific for amino acids 140-158 of human RhoB (RTDDGRAMAVRIQAYDYLE; SEQ ID NO: 1; GenBank Accession No. CAA29968). In a particular embodiment, the anti-RhoB antibody is 7F7 or 9G5. In a particular embodiment, the anti-RhoB antibody is 7F7. Amino acid and nucleotide sequences of 7F7 and 9G5 are provided in WO 2013/023059, which is incorporated herein by reference. The antibody and antibody fragment of the instant invention may comprise at least one domain from the anti-RhoB monoclonal antibodies 7F7 and 9G5. For example, the antibody or antibody fragment may comprise at least one, two, three, four, five, or all six complementarity determining region (CDR) domains of the anti-RhoB monoclonal antibodies 7F7 and 9G5. In a particular embodiment, the antibody or antibody fragment comprises at least one or both of the CDR3 domains. In a particular embodiment, the domains of the antibody or antibody fragment have at least 90%, 95%, 97%, 99%, or 100% homology or identity with the domains present in the anti-RhoB monoclonal antibody 7F7 or 9G5. The antibody may also be a synthetic protein which mimics an immunoglobulin. Examples include, without limitation, Affibody® molecules (Affibody, Bromma, Sweden), darpins (designed ankyrin repeat proteins; Kawe et al. (2006) J. Biol. Chem., 281:40252-40263), and peptabodies (Terskikh et al. (1997) PNAS 94:1663-1668). The antibodies of the instant invention may be further modified. For example, the antibodies may be humanized. In a particular embodiment, the antibodies (or a portion thereof) are inserted into the backbone of an antibody or antibody fragment construct. For example, the variable light domain and/or variable heavy domain of the antibodies of the instant invention may be inserted into another antibody construct. Methods for recombinantly producing antibodies are well-known in the art. Indeed, commercial vectors for certain antibody and antibody fragment constructs are available. The antibodies of the instant invention may also be conjugated/linked to other components. For example, the antibodies may be operably linked (e.g., covalently linked, optionally, through a linker) to at least one detectable agent, imaging agent, contrast agent, or antiangiogenesis compound. The antibodies of the instant invention may also comprise at least one purification tag (e.g., a His-tag). The antibody molecules of the invention may be prepared using a variety of methods known in the art. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies may be prepared as described in Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Ausubel et al. eds. Antibodies may be prepared by chemical cross-linking, hybrid hybridoma techniques and by expression of recombinant antibody fragments expressed in host cells, such as bacteria or yeast cells. In one embodiment of the invention, the antibody molecules are produced by expression of recombinant antibody or antibody fragments in host cells. The nucleic acid molecules encoding the antibody may be inserted into expression vectors and introduced into host cells. The resulting antibody molecules are then isolated and purified from the expression system. The antibodies optionally comprise a purification tag by which the antibody can be purified. The purity of the antibody molecules of the invention may be assessed using standard methods known to those of skill in the art, including, but not limited to, ELISA, immunohistochemistry, ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), size exclusion chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), western blotting, surface plasmon resonance and mass spectroscopy. Compositions comprising at least one anti-RhoB antibody or antibody fragment are also encompassed by the instant invention. In a particular embodiment, the composition comprises at least one anti-RhoB antibody or antibody fragment and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The composition may further comprise at least one other therapeutic compound for the inhibition, treatment, and/or prevention of the ocular disease or disorder (see, e.g., hereinbelow). Alternatively, at least one other therapeutic compound may be contained within a separate composition(s) with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The present invention also encompasses kits comprising a first composition comprising at least one anti-RhoB antibody or antibody fragment and a second composition comprising at least one other therapeutic compound for the inhibition, treatment, and/or prevention of the ocular disease or disorder. The first and second compositions may each further comprise at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions of the instant invention are useful for treating, inhibiting, and/or preventing an ocular disease in a subject, particularly an ocular disease characterized by abnormal vascularization. A therapeutically effective amount of the composition may be administered to the subject. The dosages, methods, and times of administration are readily determinable by persons skilled in the art, given the teachings provided herein. The compositions of the present invention can be administered by any suitable route. In a particular embodiment, the compositions described herein are administered in any way suitable to effectively achieve a desired therapeutic effect in the eye. For example, the compositions of the instant invention may be administered ocularly or locally to the eye, such as by topical administration, injection, or delivery by an implantable device. Thus, methods of administration include, without limitation, topical, intraocular (including intravitreal), transdermal, oral, intravenous, subconjunctival, subretinal, or peritoneal routes of administration. The compositions of the instant invention can be in any form applicable for ocular administration. For example, the compositions may be in the form of eye drops, sprays, creams, ointments, gels (e.g., hydrogels), leas, films, implants, solutions, suspensions, and colloidal systems (e.g. liposomes, emulsions, dendrimers, micelles, etc.). The compositions may also be modified to increase the residence time of the compounds in the eye, provide a sustained release of compounds, and/or avoid toxicity and increase ocular tolerability. In general, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier of the composition is selected from the group of diluents, preservatives, solubilizers, emulsifiers, adjuvants and/or carriers. The compositions can include diluents of various buffer content (e.g., Tris-HCl, acetate, phosphate), pH and ionic strength; and additives such as detergents and solubilizing agents (e.g., Tween® 80, Polysorbate 80), anti-oxidants (e.g., ascorbic acid, sodium metabisulfite), preservatives (e.g., Thimersol, benzyl alcohol) and bulking substances (e.g., lactose, mannitol). In a particular embodiment, the carrier is an aqueous or saline carrier. The compositions can also be incorporated into particulate preparations of polymeric compounds such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, etc., or into liposomes or nanoparticles. Such compositions may influence the physical state, stability, rate of in vivo release, and rate of in vivo clearance of components of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA). The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be prepared, for example, in liquid form, or can be in dried powder form (e.g., lyophilized) for reconstitution prior to administration. In a particular embodiment, the composition is an aqueous formulation with a pH physiologically compatible with the eye (e.g., a pH in the range from about 5.5 to about 8, particularly from about 6.0 to about 7.5). In a particular embodiment, the composition is an aqueous formulation having isotonic and physiological characteristics suitable for ocular administration. The methods of the instant invention may further comprise monitoring the ocular disease or disorder in the subject after administration of the compositions) of the instant invention to monitor the efficacy of the method. For example, the subject may undergo an appropriate eye exam to determine the severity of the ocular disease or disorder (e.g., to determine if the severity of the ocular disease or disorder has lessened). The methods of the instant invention may further comprise the administration of at least one other therapeutic method for the treatment of the ocular disease or disorder and/or the administration of at least one other therapeutic compound for the treatment of the ocular disease or disorder. Methods of treating ocular diseases, particular ocular disease characterized by abnormal vascularization, may also be treated with one or more additional therapies including, without limitation, laser therapy (e.g., laser photocoagulation and photodynamic therapy (e.g., administration of verteporfin and application of light of the correct wavelength to activate verteporfin and obliterate the vessels)) and cryotherapy (freezing). With regard to diabetic retinopathy, compounds and/or therapies which inhibit and/or treat the underlying diabetic condition may also be used. For example, compounds (e.g., insulin, metformin, meglumine, sorbitol) and methods which maintain optimal blood sugar levels can be administered to the subject. As stated hereinabove, the compositions and methods of the instant invention may further comprise one or more other compounds of methods that treat an ocular disease. In a particular embodiment, the further compound modulates ocular vascularization. Examples of other therapeutic compounds include, without limitation, corticosteroids (e.g., triamcinolone (e.g., intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide)), angiogenesis inhibitors, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies (e.g., anti-VEGF-A antibodies, ranibizumab, bevacizumab), anti-vascular endothelial growth factor aptamers (e.g., pegaptanib), vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (e.g., aflibercept), and anecortave acetate.

The following example is provided to illustrate various embodiments of the present invention. The example is not intended to limit the invention in any way. EXAMPLE The mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy has been used in studies related to retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, and/or wet macular degeneration as well as in studies evaluating the efficacy of antiangiogenic compounds. The oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) is characterized by microvascular degeneration and is associated with vascular cell damage that culminates in abnormal neovascularization. The model takes advantage of the fact that the inner vasculature of the mouse retina develops after birth. Mice lacking the rhoB gene have been shown to be resistant to OIR and when subjected to such experimental conditions, they show a more "normal" retina with fewer abnormal blood retinal vessels. Here, Svl29 mice were placed in a Plexiglas® chamber connected to an oxygen delivery system that kept the oxygen concentration at 75%. Animals were kept at 75% of oxygen in the chamber from postnatal (P) day 7 until P12 and then returned to atmospheric levels of oxygen (21%). On P14 animals received an intravitreal injection of 5μg of either the 7F7 anti-RhoB antibody or a non-specific IgG. Animals were sacrificed at P17 and their eyes were enucleated. The retinas were then extracted and labeled with lectin to study retinal vasculature in flatmounts. An avascular area around the optic nerve and an abnormal neo-vascularized area close to the edges of the retina describe the pathology of OIR. As seen in Figure 1, a "normalization" of the vasculature in the retina occurred in mice who were treated with the 7F7 anti-RhoB antibody. Indeed, the results presented in Figure 1 demonstrate a significant normalization with a p value of 0.00001 of the avascular pathology around the optic nerve. Further, the results in Figure 1 show a decrease in the abnormal neovascularization of the edge of the retina.
