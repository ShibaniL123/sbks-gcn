TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a paste composition, a calcined body and a production process for the calcined body. BACKGROUND ART Paste compositions containing inorganic particles such as conductive powder and ceramic powder are used for obtaining sintered bodies of various shapes. For example, a conductive paste composition containing conductive powder is used for formation of a circuit, production of a condenser, etc. A ceramic paste composition containing ceramic powder or a glass paste composition containing glass powder is used for producing a dielectric layer of a plasma display panel (PDP) or a multi-layer ceramic condenser (MLCC), or used for a fluorescent display tube or the like. A paste composition containing ITO is used for a transparent electrode material for forming PDP, a liquid crystal display panel (LCD), a circuit of a solar panel drive unit, etc. In addition, a paste composition containing a fluorescent substance is used for an inorganic electroluminescent (EL) element, PDP, etc., and a paste composition containing silver is used for a solar cell, LED, etc. A demand for these inorganic particle-containing paste compositions has been rapidly increasing in recent years. From such an inorganic particle-containing paste composition, a sintered body of a desired shape can be obtained by processing the composition into a given shape by a coating method using screen printing, die coating, doctor blade printing, roll coating, offset printing, gravure printing, flexographic printing, inkjet printing, dispenser printing or the like, a casting method for forming a sheet or another method and thereafter calcining the resulting product. In the inorganic particle-containing paste composition used for producing a dielectric layer (e.g., MLCC), ethyl cellulose (EC) or poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB) is often used as a binder. It is known that a paste composition containing EC or PVB is generally good in coating property and dispersibility of inorganic particles but has poor calcining property. Particularly with downsizing of condensers in recent years, improvement in performance of paste compositions has been required.

Advantageous Effects of Invention Since the paste composition comprises a (meth)acrylic (co)polymer containing 20 to 100% by mol of a constituent unit (A) represented by the above general formula (1), it has appropriate viscosity and is excellent in both of coating property and calcining property. DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS The present invention is described in detail hereinafter referring to a drawing. In the present invention, “part(s)” means “part (s) by mass”, and “%” means “% by mass”, unless otherwise noted. 1. PASTE COMPOSITION The paste composition according to one embodiment of the present invention comprises a (meth)acrylic (co)polymer containing 20 to 100% by mol of a constituent unit (A) represented by the following general formula (1). In the above formula, R1 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, R2 is a group having diameters of X<13.5 Å and Y>6.15 Å (here, X represents a length in the long-side direction and Y represents a length in the short-side direction) and having a volume larger than 80 Å3 and is a functional group having hydrogen bond property, a group having an alkoxy group or a group having an aryloxy group, and n is a number of 5 to 2000. 1.1. (Meth)Acrylic Copolymer 1.1.1 Constituent Unit (A) In the paste composition according to the present embodiment, the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer contains 20 to 100% by mol (preferably 30 to 90% by mol, more preferably 40 to 80% by mol) of a constituent unit (A) represented by the above general formula (1). In the general formula (1), R2 is a group having large steric hindrance because it has diameters of X<13.5 Å and Y>6.15 Å and has a volume larger than 80 Å3. Here, X, Y and a volume of R2 are values calculated by the EF method of MOPAC PM3. The “length in the long-side direction” as X means a distance from a carbon atom in R2 in the formula (1), said carbon atom being bonded to an oxygen atom that is adjacent and bonded to R2, to an atom in R2, said atom being at the position farthest from the carbon atom, and the “length in the short-side direction” as Y means a length of the longest portion in the direction intersecting the long-side direction. In the paste composition according to the present embodiment, R2 in the general formula (1) has diameters of X<13.5 Å and Y>6.15 Å and has a volume of 80 Å3, and therefore, in the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer, steric hindrance between molecules attributable to the bulkiness of a group represented by R2 in the general formula (1) occurs, so that intramolecular or intermolecular entanglement in the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer can be reduced. As a result, coating property of the paste composition according to the present embodiment is enhanced. Moreover, the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer is excellent in calcining property (when the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer is calcined, the amount of residual carbon is small). Examples of groups obtained by removing a functional group having hydrogen bond property, a group having an alkoxy group or a group having an aryloxy group from R2 in the general formula (1) include branched alkyl groups, such as isoalkyl group, sec-alkyl group and tert-alkyl group; and groups containing cyclic groups (e.g., cyclic hydrocarbon, heterocyclic compound), such as cyclohexyl group, benzyl group, dicyclopentanyl group, isobornyl group, dicyclopentanyl group, adamantyl group, tetrahydrofurfuryl group, γ-butyrolactone group, piperidyl group, and derivatives of these groups. Of these, preferable are branched alkyl groups of 4 to 6 carbon atoms and groups containing cyclic groups of 5 to 10 carbon atoms. From the viewpoint that the intramolecular or intermolecular entanglement in the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer can be reduced, R2 in the general formula (1) is preferably a group having diameters of X<8 Å and Y>6.15 Å and having a volume larger than 85 Å3. In the paste composition according to the present embodiment, the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer can be a (co)polymer of a monomer component containing 20 to 100% by mol (preferably 30 to 90% by mol, more preferably 40 to 80% by mol) of a monomer (a) represented by the following general formula (2), and if necessary, a monomer (b) and a monomer (c) (described later). In the above formula, R1 and R2 have the same meanings as R1 and R2 in the general formula (1). 1.1.2. Functional Group Having Hydrogen Bond Property, Group Having Alkoxy Group, Group Having Aryloxy Group The functional group having hydrogen bond property, which is contained in the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer, can contribute to development of appropriate viscosity by virtue of formation of a hydrogen bond. The functional group having hydrogen bond property, which is contained in the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer, can be, for example, at least one group selected from a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, an amino group, an amide group, an acetoacetoxy group, an acid anhydride group, a sulfonic acid group, a phosphoric acid group, a thiol group and a heterocyclic group. Of these functional groups, preferable are hydroxyl group, carboxyl group, amino group, acid anhydride group, oxirane group and oxorane group, and more preferable are hydroxyl group, amino group, acid anhydride group and oxirane group. Examples of alkoxy groups contained in the groups having an alkoxy group include straight-chain alkoxy groups, such as methoxy group, ethoxy group, n-propoxy group and n-butoxy group, branched alkyl groups, such as isopropoxy group and ethylhexyloxy group, and cyclic alkoxy groups, such as cyclohexyloxy group. Of these, preferable are branched alkoxy groups and cyclic alkoxy groups. Examples of aryloxy groups contained in the groups having an aryloxy group include a phenoxy group and a naphthoxy group, which may be substituted. Of the functional group having hydrogen bond property, the group having an alkoxy group and the group having an aryloxy group, the functional group having hydrogen bond property is preferable. Examples of the monomers (a) used for producing the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer wherein the group represented by R2 contains a functional group having hydrogen bond property, a group having an alkoxy group or a group having an aryloxy group include (meth)acrylic acid esters, such as 2-hydroxyisobutyl(meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxyisopropyl(meth)acrylate, 2,2,4-trimethyl-3-hydroxypentyl(meth)acrylate, cyclohexanedimethanol mono(meth)acrylate, 2-(meth)acryloyloxyethylhexahydrophthalic acid, 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl(meth)acrylate, pentamethylpiperidyl(meth)acrylate, tetrametahylpiperidyl(meth)acrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl(meth)acrylate, γ-butyrolactone(meth)acrylate, 2,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypropyl(meth)acrylate, hydroxycyclohexyl(meth)acrylate, 4-(meth)acryloyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, (meth)acrylic acid [(3,4-epoxycyclohexan)-1-yl]methyl, and a reaction product of dicyclopentenyl(meth)acrylate with maleic anhydride. These monomers (a) can be used singly or as a mixture of two or more kinds. 1.1.3. Constituent Unit (B) The (meth)acrylic (co)polymer can further contain a constituent unit (B) represented by the following general formula (3). In the above formula, R3 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, R4 is a group having diameters of X<13.5 Å and Y>6.15 Å (here, X represents a length in the long-side direction and Y represents a length in the short-side direction) and having a volume larger than 80 Å3 and is a group having none of a functional group having hydrogen bond property, a group having an alkoxy group and an aryloxy group, and m is a number of 5 to 1500. The total amount of the constituent unit (A) and the constituent unit (B) in the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer is 70 to 100% by mol, preferably 80 to 90% by mol. In the general formula (3), X, Y and a volume of R4 are values calculated by the EF method of MOPAC PM3, similarly to those of R2 in the aforesaid general formula (1). Here, the “length in the long-side direction” as X means a distance from a carbon atom in R4 in the above formula (3), said carbon atom being bonded to an oxygen atom that is adjacent and bonded to R4, to an atom in R4, said atom being at the position farthest from the carbon atom, and the “length in the short-side direction” as Y means a length of the longest portion in the direction intersecting the long-side direction.

In the above formula, R3 and R4 have the same meanings as R3 and R4 in the general formula (3). R4 in the monomer (b) represented by the above general formula (4) has a group having the same size (group having large steric hindrance) as the group represented by R2 in the monomer (a) represented by the aforesaid general formula (2), but differently from R2, this R4 is a group having none of a functional group having hydrogen bond property, an alkoxy group and an aryloxy group. Examples of the monomers (b) include tert-butyl(meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl(meth)acrylate, isobornyl(meth)acrylate, dicyclopentanyl(meth)acrylate and adamantyl(meth)acrylate.

These monomers (b) can be used singly or as a mixture of two or more kinds. 1.1.4. Another Constituent Unit The (meth)acrylic (co)polymer may further have another constituent unit (C). The proportion of another constituent unit (C) in the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer is, for example, 0 to 30% by mol, preferably 0 to 20% by mol. In order to obtain the constituent unit (C), for example, a monomer component further containing a monomer (c) other than the monomer (a) and the monomer (b) is used to produce the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer. Examples of the monomers (c) include methyl(meth)acrylate, ethyl(meth)acrylate, isobutyl(meth)acrylate, n-butyl(meth)acrylate, lauryl(meth)acrylate, styryl(meth)acrylate, styrene, a vinyl compound, (meth)acrylic acid, maleic anhydride, 2-methacryloyloxyethylsuccininc acid, 2-(meth)acryloyloxyethylphthalic acid, acetoacetoxy(meth)acrylate, N,N-dimethylaminoethyl(meth)acrylate, N,N-diethylaminoethyl(meth)acrylate, (meth)acrylamide, 2-(meth)acryloyloxyethyl acid phosphate, 2-(meth)acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid, and (meth)acrylic acid esters, e.g., hydroxyl group-containing (meth)acrylic acid esters, such as 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxy-n-propyl(meth)acrylate, 3-hydroxy-n-propyl(meth)acrylate, 3-hydroxybutyl(meth)acrylate, 4-hydroxybutyl(meth)acrylate, 3-methyl-3-hydroxybutyl(meth)acrylate, 1,1-dimethyl-3-hydroxybutyl(meth)acrylate, 1,3-dimethyl-3-hydroxybutyl(meth)acrylate, 2-ethyl-3-hydroxyhexyl(meth)acrylate, polyethylene glycol mono(meth)acrylate and polypropylene glycol mono(meth)acrylate.

The proportion of the monomer (c) in the total amount of the monomer component is, for example, 0 to 30% by mol (preferably 0 to 20% by mol). 1.1.5. Content The content of the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer is preferably 1 to 20%, more preferably 5 to 10%, of the total amount of the paste composition according to the present embodiment, from the viewpoint that appropriate viscosity, good coating property and good calcining property are ensured. 1.1.6. SP Value The SP value of the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer is preferably 7 to 10, more preferably 8 to 10, from the viewpoint that the (co)polymer has appropriate viscosity. The SP value of the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer is an indication of polarity of the (co)polymer and is a measure to confirm solubility in a solvent used in the preparation of a paste. In the present invention, the SP value of the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer and the SP value of the later-described solvent can be calculated from a constant of ΔF of Okitsu (Toshinao Okitsu, “Adhesion”, Vol. 40, No. 8, P. 342 (1996)). 1.1.7. Molecular weight From the viewpoint that good coating property is ensured, the weight-average molecular weight of the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer is preferably 1,000 to 200,000, more preferably 10,000 to 100,000. If the weight-average molecular weight of the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer is less than 1,000, a desired paste viscosity is not obtained. On the other hand, if the weight-average molecular weight of the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer exceeds 200,000, stringing property is increased, and sufficient coating property is not obtained. In the present invention, as a method to measure a molecular weight, a method described in the later-described working examples is used. 1.1.8 Production of (Meth)Acrylic (Co)Polymer The polymerization process for the (meth)acrylic polymer is not specifically restricted, but it is preferable to usually use solution polymerization. The solution polymerization is carried out by introducing prescribed organic solvent, monomer and polymerization initiator into a polymerization tank and subjecting them to thermal reaction in a stream of nitrogen at an appropriate temperature for several hours with stirring. In this case, at least a part of the organic solvent, the monomer, the polymerization initiator and/or a chain transfer agent may be successively added. Examples of the organic solvents for polymerization include aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, n-propylbenzene, t-butylbenzene, o-xylene, m-xylene, p-xylene, tetralin, decalin and aromatic naphtha; aliphatic or alicyclic hydrocarbons, such as n-hexane, n-heptane, n-octane, i-octane, n-decane, dipentene, petroleum spirit, petroleum naphtha and turpentine oil; esters, such as alkyl acetate (here, alkyl is, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl or amyl; the same shall apply hereinafter) and methyl benzoate; derivatives of ethylene glycol, such as monoacetate, diacetate, alkyl ether acetate, (e.g., diethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate), monoalkyl ether and dialkyl ether of ethylene glycol or diethyleneglycol; propylene glycol derivatives, such as monoacetate, diacetate, alkyl ether acetate, monoakyl ether (e.g., tripropylene glycol monobutyl ether) or dialkyl ether of any one glycol of propylene glycol, dipropylene ethylene glycol and tripropylene glycol; ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl i-butyl ketone, isophorone, cyclohexanone and methylcyclohexanone; and texanol (2,2,4-trimethylpentane-1,3-diol monoisobutyrate). These organic solvents can be used singly or as a mixture of two or more kinds. As the organic solvent for polymerization, a solvent having a high boiling point is preferable, and specifically, a solvent having a boiling point of 50 to 300° C. is preferable. Examples of the polymerization initiators include organic peroxides, such as benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, caproyl peroxide, di-t-butyl peroxide, di-i-propyl peroxydicarbonate, di-2-ethylhexyl peroxydicarbonate, t-butyl peroxypivalate; and azo compounds, such as 2,2′-azobis-i-butyronitile, 2,2′-azobis-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile and 2,2′-azobis-4-methoxy-2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile. These polymerization initiators can be used singly or in combination. The amount of the polymerization initiator used is generally in the range of about 0.01 to 5 parts by mass, preferably about 0.02 to 2 parts by mass, based on 100 parts by mass of the total amount of the monomers. The polymerization temperature is preferably 40 to 180° C. If the polymerization temperature is lower than 40° C., there is a fear that a sufficient reaction rate will not be obtained. If the polymerization temperature exceeds 180° C., there is a fear of occurrence of depolymerization. When an unreacted monomer is contained in the polymerization product obtained by solution polymerization or the like, it is possible to purify the polymerization product by a reprecipiation method using methanol or the like in order to remove the monomer. 1.2. Other Components The paste composition according to the present embodiment can further contain a solvent, and inorganic powder or a dispersing agent, in addition to the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer. 1.2.1. Solvent As the solvent employable in the paste composition according to the present embodiment, an organic solvent can be mentioned, and for example, a solvent satisfying a relationship of the following formula (5) with the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer is preferable. By the use of a solvent satisfying a relationship of the following formula (5) with the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer, compatibility of the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer with the solvent is enhanced, and the stability of the paste composition produced is increased. [in-line-formulae]|(SP value of the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer)−(SP value of the solvent)|≦2 (5)[/in-line-formulae] The content of the solvent in the paste composition according to the present embodiment is preferably 10 to 60%, more preferably 30 to 50%, of the total amount of the paste composition according to the present embodiment.

The boiling point of the solvent is preferably 150 to 300° C., more preferably 220 to 280° C. If the boiling point is lower than 150° C., there is a fear that the drying rate of the paste after screen printing may be increased. On the other hand, if the boiling point exceeds 300° C., the drying rate is decreased. In either case, workability is liable to be lowered. 1.2.2. Inorganic Powder or Dispersing Agent Examples of the inorganic powders employable in the paste composition according to the present embodiment include metal powders, metal oxide powders, glass powders, pigment powders, fluorescent substance powders and ceramic powders.

The content of the inorganic powder in the paste composition according to the present embodiment is preferably 20 to 70% by weight, more preferably 40 to 60% by weight, of the total amount of the paste composition according to the present embodiment. The content of the dispersing agent is preferably 0.01 to 5% by weight, more preferably 0.1 to 3% by weight, of the total amount of the paste composition according to the present embodiment. 1.2.3. Other Components The paste composition according to the present embodiment may contain hitherto known plasticizer, wetting agent, anti-foaming agent and others, within limits not detrimental to the object of the present invention, in addition to the aforesaid (meth)acrylic (co)polymer, solvent, inorganic powder and dispersing agent. 1.2.4. Viscosity By the use of the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer of the present invention, the paste composition according to the present embodiment can ensure appropriate viscosity and good coating property. Specifically, a paste composition obtained by kneading a composition consisting of the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer of the present invention, a nickel filler having a mean particle diameter of 200 nm and dihydroterpineol (blending ratio by weight: 5/100/70) by a revolving/rotating mixer and then further kneading the kneadate by a three-roll mill has a viscosity at 25° C. of 0.5 to 30 Pa·s, preferably 3 to 20 Pa·s. 1.3. Uses The paste composition according to the present embodiment can be used to be applied using, for example, screen printing, die coating, doctor blade printing, roll coating, offset printing, gravure printing, flexographic printing, inkjet printing or dispenser printing. The paste composition is preferably used for screen printing among them. Examples of specific uses of the paste composition according to the present embodiment include a paste for internal electrode, which is used for production of MLCC, a paste for terminal electrode, a paste for internal electrode, which is used for production of LTCC, a paste for touch panel screen, a dielectric paste used for production of PDP, a barrier material paste, a fluorescent substance paste, a sealing glass paste used for sealing of FED or IC package and a paste for green sheet. For example, the paste composition is preferably used for producing a green sheet of MLCC. Using the paste composition according to the present embodiment, MLCC can be produced by, for example, the following method. To a ceramic raw material, ethanol and a PVB-based binder are added, and they are mixed and dispersed to prepare a ceramic slurry. Then, the ceramic slurry is formed into a sheet to obtain a ceramic green sheet. On this ceramic green sheet, an internal electrode-forming Ni paste is printed to form an internal electrode pattern (conductive paste layer). Then, plural ceramic green sheets, on each of which the internal electrode pattern has been formed, are laminated in such a manner that the internal electrode patterns are alternately drawn out on the reverse end sides, whereby an uncalcined laminate is obtained. Subsequently, this laminate is heat-treated in a N2 atmosphere to obtain a ceramic laminate (multi-layer ceramic element). Both end surfaces of the ceramic laminate obtained after calcining are coated with a Cu paste, and the laminate is calcined in a N2 atmosphere to form a terminal electrode that is electrically connected to the internal electrode, whereby MLCC is obtained. 1.4. Working Effect Since the paste composition according to the present embodiment contains a (meth)acrylic (co)polymer having a functional group having hydrogen bond property and containing 20 to 100% by mol of the constituent unit (A), the paste composition is excellent in both of coating property and calcining property. On the other hand, if a (meth)acrylic (co)polymer containing less than 20% by mol of the constituent unit (A) or a (meth)acrylic (co)polymer containing no constituent unit (A) is used in a paste composition, intramolecular and intermolecular entanglement in the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer is strong, thixotropic property (viscosity property) is not good, and stringing property is high. As a result, it is difficult for such a paste composition to exhibit desired coating property. In the meantime, a technique to introduce an alkylene oxide as a functional group into a (meth)acrylic (co)polymer has been proposed, but in this case, the viscosity of the resulting paste is low, so that such a (meth)acrylic (co)polymer is not suitable for a paste composition. In contrast therewith, since the paste composition according to the present embodiment contains a (meth)acrylic (co)polymer containing 20 to 100% by mol of the constituent unit (A), intermolecular entanglement in the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer can be reduced, and therefore, thixotropic property (viscosity property) can be enhanced. Hence, the paste composition exhibits appropriate viscosity and has low stringing property, and therefore, coating property can be enhanced. Further, since the paste composition according to the present embodiment contains a (meth)acrylic (co)polymer containing 20 to 100% by mol of the constituent unit (A), this composition is excellent in calcining property. 2. PRODUCTION PROCESS FOR CALCINED BODY The production process for a calcined body according to another embodiment of the present invention comprises a step of applying the paste composition according to the above embodiment to a base, a step of drying the applied paste composition, and a step of calcining the base including the dried paste composition.

Ex. 6 polymer 16 0 64 9.1 50,000 Δ X Δ ◯ According to Table 3, it can be understood that since the paste compositions of Examples 1 to 10 each contained a (meth)acrylic (co)polymer containing 20 to 100% by mol (more specifically 70 to 100% by mol) of the constituent unit (A) represented by the aforesaid general formula (1), they have appropriate viscosity and good dispersing stability, and therefore, they are excellent in coating property and are also excellent in calcining property and printability. In particular, it can be understood that the paste compositions of Examples 1 to 10 are excellent in calcining property as compared with the case where ethyl cellulose or poly(vinyl butyral) was used instead of the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer (Comparative Examples 1 and 2). It can be understood that in contrast with the above, in the paste compositions of Comparative Examples 3 to 6, the proportion of the constituent unit (A) in the (meth)acrylic (co)polymer was less than 70% by mol (more specifically, less than 20% by mol), and therefore, those compositions are poor in printability. That is to say, in the paste compositions of Comparative Examples 3 to 6, the proportion of the constituent unit (A) is low, and therefore, desired paste viscosity is not exhibited, and besides, interaction between an ester group derived from acrylic and other molecules tends to occur. As a result, intermolecular entanglement is strengthened, and therefore, stringing property is deteriorated, and printability is deteriorated. 1.
