CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/964,771, filed on Jan. 14, 2014, and entitled “Varieties of Calla Lily Plants”, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. BOTANICAL CLASSIFICATION Zantedeschia sprengeri VARIETAL DENOMINATION ‘SUMATRA’ BACKGROUND OF THE NEW PLANT The present invention comprises a new and distinct cultivar of calla lily, botanically known as Zantedeschia sprengeri and hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name ‘Sumatra’. ‘Sumatra’ is a product of a planned breeding program, which had the objective of creating Zantedeschia hybrids for pot flower production in a wide range of colors with a large, classic flower shape. The breeding program began in 1989, and the new cultivar is a seedling selected from the crossing of Zantedeschia sprengeri ‘Black Star’ (female parent, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 14,844) with a Zantedeschia sprengeri selection referred to as CO3002 (male parent, unpatented). ‘Sumatra’ was selected in 2006 by the inventor in 't Zand, The Netherlands as one flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross. The first act of asexual reproduction of ‘Sumatra’ by tissue culture was performed by the inventor in September of 2006 in 't Zand, The Netherlands. Subsequent asexual reproductions by tissue culture at the same location have demonstrated that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for the new cultivar are retained and reproduced true to type through successive generations of asexual reproduction. The following observations, measurements and comparisons describe plants grown in a 14 cm pot in 't Zand, The Netherlands under greenhouse conditions, which approximate those generally used in horticultural practice. Color references are made to the R.H.S. Colour Chart of The Royal Horticulture Society of London, except where general color terms of ordinary significance are used. The present invention has not been evaluated under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary with variations in environment without a change in the genotype of the plant. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and determined to be basic characteristics of ‘Sumatra’ which, in combination, distinguish this calla lily as a new and distinct cultivar: 1. Purple-colored spathe; 2. Compact growth habit; and 3. High inflorescence production. Table 1 provides similarities and differences of ‘Sumatra’ to its parents, Zantedeschia sprengeri ‘Black Star’ and selection CO3002.
