Pesticide composition comprising propamocarb-hydrochloride AND AN INSECTICIDE ACTIVE SUBSTANCE This application is a divisional application of Australian Patent No. 2007338050, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Description The present invention relates to a pesticide composition intended for protecting plants, crops or seeds against fungal diseases or insect damages, and the corresponding methods of protection by application of the said composition. More precisely, the subject of the present invention is a pesticide composition based on propamocarb-HCI and an insecticide active substance or compound and optionally a further fungicide active substance or compound. As regards pesticide activity, in particular for the protection of crops, one of the problems at the heart of the research studies carried out in this technical field is the improvement of performances, in particular in terms of biological activity and in particular in terms of maintaining such an activity over time. The present invention provides a pesticide composition which can be used, in particular by the farmer, for controlling the pest infesting crops and in particular for controlling insects or diseases of corn, beet, cotton, canola, beans, peanuts vegetables, lucerne, soybean, market garden crops, turf, wood, tree and horticultural plants, for example Pythium on corn. The pesticide compounds useful for the protection of plants must be endowed with an ecotoxicity which is reduced to the minimum. As far as possible, they should not be dangerous or toxic to the operator during use. The economic factor should of course not be overlooked in the search for novel pesticide agents. Propamocarb-hydrochloride or propamocarb-HCI is a known compound having as chemical name propyl [3-(dimethylamino)propyl]carbamate hydrochloride and which is represented by the following formula: Propamocarb moiety is described in British patent GB-1212708: activity is reported in controlling Pythium ultimum. This document is silent with regard to any result or biological activity of such potential mixtures. In particular, this document does not report any activity to specifically control seed diseases with propamocarb-HCI mixtures nor this document discloses any mixture of propamocarb-HCI with any insecticide active substance. There is no mention in this document Cl of any particular result or biological activity of any mixture of propamocarb-HCI with an insecticide active substance. In international patent application WO-2006/024333 there are generically disclosed mixtures of certain neonicotinoid insecticide compounds with known fungicide substances; propamocarb is part of long list of such known fungicide substances. However, there is no specific disclosure in this document of any combination comprising propamocarb. In international patent applications WO-2004/080181 and WO-2007/101547 there are generically disclosed numerous mixtures of some phtalamide insecticide compounds with known fungicide substances. The association of these insecticide compounds with propamocarb has not been specifically disclosed nor has been subject to any experimentation. Such an association does not form part of the present invention. In a main aspect, the present invention provides a composition comprising: A) propamocarb-HCI and Β) an insecticide compound selected from the group consisting of spirodiclofen, spiromesifen, spirotetramat, and rynaxypyr in an Α/Β weight ratio ranging from 1/1,000 to 1,000/1. According to the present invention, propamocarb-HCI and propamocarb can be used in the same manner. Both forms are part of the present invention in its various aspects or preferences. The present invention advantageously provides a pesticide composition which is completely high-performing in particular as regards its efficacy against pests and the perenniallity of this 6790361_1 (GHMatters) P80785.AU.1 KIRSTENA efficacy so as to be able to reduce the doses of chemical products spread in the environment for combating pest damages or attacks of plants or crops. The invention provides a pesticide composition capable to be more active and active for longer, and which therefore has a lower dose, but which is also less toxic, in particular in the treatment of plants and particularly the foliar and seed treatments of fungal diseases or the control of insects, for example, of cereals, cotton, peanut, bean, beet, canola, Solanaceae, grapevine, vegetables, lucerne, soybean, market garden crops, turf, wood or horticultural plants. The composition according to the invention allows controlling a broad variety of insects or fungi. For example, the pesticide composition according to the invention exhibits an improved efficacy against fungus like Plasmodiophoromycetes, Oomycetes, Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Deuteromycetes and Ascomycetes. All these advantages, among others, were achieved by finding a pesticide composition comprising propamocarb-HCI; an insecticide compound and optionally a further fungicide compound. Such a composition surprisingly and unexpectedly allows a very high and perennial insecticide or anti-fungal efficacy against a broad spectrum of insects or fungi and in particular against those responsible for diseases or damages of corn for example to Oomycetes. Other insect pests or diseases of corn can be controlled with the pesticide composition according to the invention, in particular the control of Ascomycetes or Basidiomycetes. The pesticide composition according to the invention may also be used for the treatment of bacterial or virus diseases. Insects or nematodes that can be controlled with the pesticide composition according to the invention include a broad variety of these damaging organisms.

In addition to these additional active agents, the pesticide composition according to the invention may also comprise any other adjuvants or auxiliary agent useful in plant protection formulations such as, for example, an agriculturally suitable inert carrier and optionally an agriculturally suitable surfactant. For its practical use, the pesticide composition according to the invention can be used alone or in formulations containing one or the other of the active ingredients or alternatively both of them together, in combination or association with one or more other compatible components which are, for example, solid or liquid fillers or diluents, adjuvants, surfactants or equivalents, which are suitable for the desired use and which are acceptable for uses in agriculture. The formulations can be of any type known in the sector that is suitable for application onto all types of cultures or crops. These formulations, which can be prepared in any manner known by the skilled person, also form part of the invention. The formulations may also contain ingredients of other types, such as protective colloids, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetrating agents, oils for spraying, stabilisers, preserving agents (in particular mould-proofing or biocide agents), sequestering or chelating agents or the like. More generally, the compounds used in the invention can be combined with any solid or liquid additives corresponding to the usual formulation techniques. The term “filler” means an organic or inorganic, natural or synthetic component with which the active components are combined to facilitate its application, for example, onto the plants, the seeds or the soil. This filler is consequently generally inert and it must be acceptable (for example acceptable for agronomic uses, in particular for treating plants). The filler can be solid, for example clays, natural or synthetic silicates, silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilizers (for example ammonium salts), natural soil minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, lime, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite, bentonite or diatomaceous earths, or synthetic minerals, such as silica, alumina or silicates, in particular aluminium or magnesium silicates. The solid fillers which are suitable for granules are as follows: natural, crushed or broken rocks, such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite; synthetic granules of inorganic or organic flours; granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shell, corn ear or envelope, or tobacco stem; kieselguhr, tricalcium phosphate, powdered cork or adsorbent carbon black; water-soluble polymers, resins, waxes; or solid fertilizers. Such composition may, if so desired, contain one or more compatible agents such as wetting agents, dispersing agents, emulsifiers or colourings which, when they are solid, may also act as diluents. The fillers may also be liquid, for example: water, alcohols, in particular butanol or glycol, as well as ethers or esters thereof, in particular methyl glycol acetate; ketones, in particular acetone, cyclohexanone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or isophorone; petroleum fractions such as paraffinic or aromatic hydrocarbons, in particular xylenes or alkylnaphthalenes; mineral or plant oils; aliphatic chlorohydrocarbons, in particular trichloroethane or methylene chloride; aromatic chlorohydrocarbons, in particular chlorobenzenes; water-soluble or highly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulphoxide, N,N-dimethyl-acetamide or Νmethylpyrrolidone; N-octylpyrrolidone, liquefied gases; or the like, whether they are taken separately or as a mixture. The surfactant can be an emulsifier, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent, of ionic or nonionic type or a mixture of these surfactants. Among those surfactants there are used, for example, polyacrylic acid salts, lignosulphonic acid salts, phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acid salts, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or fatty acids or fatty esters or fatty amines, substituted phenols (in particular alkylphenols or arylphenols), ester-salts of sulphosuccinic acid, taurine derivatives (in particular alkyl taurates), phosphoric esters of alcohols or of polycondensates of ethylene oxide with phenols, fatty acid esters with polyols, or sulphate, sulphonate or phosphate functional derivatives of the compounds described above. The presence of at least one surfactant is generally essential when the active ingredients and/or the inert filler are insoluble or only sparingly soluble in water and when the filler for the said composition to be applied is water. The formulations may also contain other additives such as adhesives or dyes. Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose or natural or synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or matrices, such as gum arabic, latex, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl acetate, natural phospholipids, such as cephalins or lecithins, or synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. It is possible to use colourings such as inorganic pigments, such as, for example: iron oxides, titanium oxides, Prussian blue; organic colouring stuffs, such as those of the alizarin, azo or metal phthalocyanin type; or of trace elements such as iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum or zinc salts. The form of the pesticide composition according to the invention can be selected in a large number of formulations, such as aerosol dispenser; suspension of capsules; cold fogging concentrate; dustable powder; emulsifiable concentrate; aqueous/aqueous type emulsion; oil/inverse type emulsion; encapsulated granule; fine granule; suspension concentrate for seed treatment; compressed gas; gas generating product; granule; hot fogging concentrate; macrogranule; microgranule; oil-dispersible powder; oil miscible suspension concentrate; oilmiscible liquid; paste; plant rodlet; powder for dry seed treatment; seeds coated with a pesticide; smoke maydle; smoke cartridge; smoke generator; smoke pellet; smoke rodlet; smoke tablet; smoke tin; soluble concentrate; soluble powder; solution for seed treatment; suspension concentrate (= flowable concentrate); ultra low volume liquid; ultra low volume suspension; vapour releasing product; water-dispersible granules or tablets; water dispersible powder for slurry treatment; water-soluble granules or tablets; water-soluble powder for seed treatment; wettable powder. The pesticide composition according to the present invention covers not only the compositions which are ready to be applied to the crop by means of a suitable device, such as a spraying device, but also the commercial concentrated composition which have to be diluted before application to the crop. The pesticide composition herein described is used in general for application to growing plants, or to sites where crops are grown or intended to grow, or for the treatment, coating or film-coating of seeds. According to the present invention, seeds may comprise any propagation materials, like for example seeds, fruit, tubers, grains, roots, rhizomes, parts of plants. The pesticide composition according to the invention may also be applied to the vegetation and in particular to the leaves infested or capable of being infested with the phytopathogenic fungi or damaged by insects. Another method of applying the pesticide composition according to the invention is to add a formulation containing the active ingredients to the irrigation water. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for controlling the phytopathogenic fungi or damaging insects of plants, crops or seeds, characterized in that an agronomically effective and substantially non-phytotoxic quantity of a pesticide composition according to the invention is applied as seed treatment, foliar application, stem application, drench or drip application or chemigation to the seed, the plant or to the fruit of the plant or to soil or to inert substrate (e.g. inorganic substrates like sand, rockwool, glasswool; expanded minerals like perlite, vermiculite, zeolite or expanded clay), Pumice, Pyroclastic materials or stuff, synthetic organic substrates (e.g. polyurethane), organic substrates (e.g. peat, composts, tree waste products like coir, wood fibre or chips, tree bark) or to a liquid substrate (e.g. floating hydroponic systems, Nutrient Film Technique, Aeroponics) wherein the plant is growing or in which it is desired to grow. The expression “are applied to the plants to be treated” is understood to mean, for the purposes of the present invention, that the pesticide composition which is the subject of the invention can be applied by means of various methods of treatment such as: - spraying onto the aerial parts of the said plants a liquid comprising one of the said compositions, - dusting, the incorporation into the soil of granules or powders, spraying, around the said plants, and in the case of trees injection or daubing, - coating or film-coating the seeds of the said plants with the aid of a plant-protection mixture comprising one of the said compositions. The method according to the invention may either be a curing, preventing or eradicating method. In this method, a composition used can be prepared beforehand by mixing the two or more active compounds according to the invention. 6790361_1 (GHMatters) P80785.AU.1 KIRSTENA According to an alternative of such a method, it is also possible to apply simultaneously, successively or separately compounds (A) and (Β) and optionally (C) so as to have the conjugated (Α)/(Β) (optionally (C)) effects, of distinct compositions each containing one of the two or three active ingredients (A) or (Β), optionally (C). Such a method can be extended to the further application of compound (C). The dose of active compound usually applied in the method of treatment according to the invention is generally and advantageously for foliar treatments: from 0.1 to 10,000 g/ha, preferably from 10 to 1,000 g/ha, more preferably from 50 to 300g/ha; in case of drench or drip application, the dose can even be reduced, especially while using inert substrates like rockwool or perlite; for seed treatment: from 2 to 200 g per 100 kilogram of seed, preferably from 3 to 150 g per 100 kilogram of seed; for soil treatment: from 0.1 to 10,000 g/ha, preferably from 1 to 5,000 g/ha. The doses herein indicated are given as illustrative examples of the method according to the invention. A person skilled in the art will know how to adapt the application doses, notably according to the nature of the plant or crop to be treated. Under specific conditions, for example according to the nature of the phytopathogenic fungus to be treated or insect to control, a lower dose may offer adequate protection. Certain climatic conditions, resistance or other factors like the nature of the phytopathogenic fungi or damaging insect to be eliminated or the degree of infestation, for example, of the plants with these fungi, may require higher doses of combined active ingredients. The optimum dose usually depends on several factors, for example on the type of phytopathogenic fungus to be treated or insect to control, on the type or level of development of the infested plant, on the density of vegetation, or alternatively on the method of application. Without it being limiting, the crop treated with the pesticide composition or combination according to the invention is, for example, grapevine, but this could be cereals, vegetables, lucerne, soybean, market garden crops, turf, wood, tree or horticultural plants. The method of treatment according to the invention may also be useful to treat propagation material such as tubers or rhizomes, but also seeds, seedlings or seedlings pricking out and plants or plants pricking out. This method of treatment may also be useful to treat roots. The method of treatment according to the invention may also be useful to treat the over-ground parts of the plant such as trunks, stems or stalks, leaves, flowers and fruit of the concerned plant. Among the plants that can be protected by the method according to the invention, mention can be made of cotton; flax; vine; fruit or vegetable crops such as Rosaceae sp. (for instance pip fruit such as apples and pears, but also stone fruit such as apricots, almonds and peaches), Ribesioidae sp., Juglandaceae sp., Betulaceae sp., Anacardiaceae sp., Fagaceae sp., Moraceae sp., Oleaceae sp., Actinidaceae sp., Lauraceae sp., Musaceae sp. (for instance banana trees and plantins), Rubiaceae sp., Theaceae sp., Sterculiceae sp., Rutaceae sp. (for instance lemons, oranges and grapefruit); Solanaceae sp. (for instance tomatoes), Liliaceae sp., Asteraceae sp. (for instance lettuces), Umbelliferae sp., Cruciferae sp., Chenopodiaceae sp., Cucurbitaceae sp., Papilionaceae sp. (for instance peas), Rosaceae sp. (for instance strawberries); major crops such as Graminae sp. (for instance maize, lawn or cereals such as wheat, rice, barley and triticale), Asteraceae sp. (for instance sunflower), Cruciferae sp. (for instance colza), Fabacae sp. (for instance peanuts), Papilionaceae sp. (for instance soybean), Solanaceae sp. (for instance potatoes), Chenopodiaceae sp. (for instance beetroots); horticultural and forest crops; as well as genetically modified homologues of these crops. The composition according to the invention may also be used in the treatment of genetically modified organisms with the compounds according to the invention or the agrochemical compositions according to the invention. Genetically modified plants are plants into genome of which a heterologous gene encoding a protein of interest has been stably integrated. The expression “heterologous gene encoding a protein of interest” essentially means genes which give the transformed plant new agronomic properties, or genes for improving the agronomic quality of the modified plant. The composition according to the invention may also be used against fungal diseases liable to grow on or inside timber. The term “timber” means all types of species of wood, and all types of working of this wood intended for construction, for example solid wood, high-density wood, laminated wood, and plywood. The method for treating timber according to the invention mainly consists in contacting one or more compounds according to the invention, or a composition according to the invention; this includes for example direct application, spraying, dipping, injection or any other suitable means.
