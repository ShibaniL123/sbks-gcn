Step 8-1-1: Preparation of (S)-5-chloro-3-phenyl-2-(pyrrolidine-2-yl)pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine-4(3H)-one(9a)
Tert-butyl (S)-2-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydropyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine-2-yl)pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate(8a) (130mg, 0.31 mmol) was dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid (50 wt % dichloromethane) (2 ml) at 0° C., followed by stirring at room temperature for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was neutralized with NaHCO3 at 0° C., followed by extraction using dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine, separated, dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. As a result, 96 mg of the target compound (S)-5-chloro-3-phenyl-2-(pyrrolidine-2-yl)pyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazine-4(3H)-one(9a) was obtained as a white solid (0.30 mmol, yield: 97%).
