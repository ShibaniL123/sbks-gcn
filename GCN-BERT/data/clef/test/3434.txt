Dimensions and characteristics of the films as well as of applicator heads are adapted to optimize healing and usability. FIG. 1 is a high level schematic illustration of a wound 90 in tissue 91, a film 110 and an applicator head 130 for plasma treating wound 90 or tissue 91, according to some embodiments of the invention. FIGS. 2 and 3 are high level schematic illustrations reinforced films 110, according to some embodiments of the invention. Film 110 is made of biocompatible material 92 selected to enhance tissue treatment by plasma welding. Biocompatible material 92 may be selected to degrade or disintegrate over time. In certain non-limiting examples, plasma welding may be carried out by cold plasma non charring plasma, e.g., at 40° C. Film 110 may be formed as an elongated strip (FIG. 1) and further comprise attached adhesive tape 115 on at least one long side 111 of the elongated strip. In certain embodiments, adhesive tape 115 may be attached on both long sides 111 of the elongated strip (FIGS. 2, 3). Biocompatible material 92 may comprise chitosan and may be translucent or transparent. Biocompatible material 92 may soften upon contact with tissue exudates (e.g., blood) and stick to edges 95 of wound 90. Biocompatible material 92 may be selected to promote coagulation through its mechanical, chemical and/or biological properties, in themselves and/or in combination with the plasma application. Film 110 may comprise at least one reinforcement 120 interconnecting the attached adhesive tapes 115 on the sides of the elongated strip as illustrated in FIG. 3. In certain embodiments, reinforcements 120 may comprise bridges between adhesive tapes 115, made e.g. of medical plaster, synthetic fibers or even pre-heated biocompatible material 92 (e.g., chitosan). In certain embodiments reinforcements 120 may be 1-3 mm wide and be 3-10 mm apart. Film 110 may comprise at least one reinforced zone 120 of pre-heated film material, as illustrated in FIG. 2. For example, film 110 may comprise a plurality of linear reinforced zones 120 traversing a narrow dimension of elongated film strip 110, as illustrated in FIG. 2. In certain embodiments, linear reinforced zones 120 may be 1-3 mm wide and be 3-10 mm apart. Linear reinforced zones 120 may interconnect the attached adhesive tapes 115 on the sides of elongated film strip 110. In certain embodiments, linear reinforced zones 120 may be produced across, along, or at any other orientation on film 110. In certain embodiments, linear reinforced zones 120 may crisscross film 110 or be produced with variable orientation. Film 110 may be reinforced by embedded reinforcement fibers. A thickness of film 110 may be selected according to expected mechanical strains. Thickened zones 152 (FIG. 5B) in film 110 may be configured to enhance its mechanical strength. Thickening film material and embedding fibers in the film may be carried out to prevent tearing of film 110 during application to the tissue and/or during plasma application. In certain embodiments, application of film 110 may be accompanied by a removable or degradable suture or staple or by additional adhesive films. Film 110 is arranged to overcome chitosan's softening upon contact with wound fluids and blood or other tissue exudates. Reinforcements 120 are arranged to allow handling film 110 and keeping its form while maintaining the ability of film 110 to cover the wound or tissue and attach the wound's edges. Reinforcements 120 are arranged to provide sufficient mechanical support to film 110, to allow easy handling of film 110 and efficient closure of wound 90 and treatment of tissue 91 in face of possible softening of the chitosan material. In certain embodiments, pre-heating regions 120 of film 110 improve the physical properties (e.g., tensile strength and elasticity) of film 110 upon contact with the patient's blood. The chitosan material may be seen as tissue solder, and film 110 may be seen as a solder film, designed to allow soldering wound 90 by plasma welding. In certain embodiments, film 110 comprises an adhesive wound closure that comprises a sheet of solder film, a first elongated band of adhesive on a first side of the sheet and a second elongated band of adhesive on a second side of the sheet. The first and second adhesive bands (adhesive tapes 115) bound an intermediate non-adhesive band of the solder material (biocompatible material 92) and the composite structure of the first band, the second band, and the intermediate non-adhesive band of solder material has a tensile strength chosen so that when the first elongated band of adhesive is adhered along one elongated edge of a tissue incision, and the second elongated band is adhered along a second elongated edge of a tissue incision, the composite structure holds opposing incision edges adjacent each other with the non-adhesive intermediate band overlying the opposing incision edges. Solder film 110 may be configured to allow plasma passage through it and interact with the incision below it. Solder film 110 may comprise chitosan, albumin, fibrin, and/or other natural or synthetic biocompatible material 92. In certain embodiments, adhesive tapes 115 may comprise adhesive and removable carrier material to protect the adhesive until use. In certain embodiments, film 110 may be between 7 cm and 20 cm long (114), or longer. In certain embodiments, film 110 may be at least 3 mm wide (112).

In certain embodiments, film 110 may be part of a larger sheet configured to be cut by medical personnel before actual application, thereby allowing selection of an appropriate size of the applied film. The sheet may be perforated or otherwise pre-formed to enable easy selection of the wanted film size, or may be simply cut to the right size. The sheet or multiple sheets (possibly with cutting means) may be part of kit 100 described below.

In certain embodiment, film 110 may be permeable (e.g., be perforated, FIG. 5C) to allow passage of tissue exudates and thereby enhance either or both plasma transmission to wound 90 or tissue 91 and removal of wound fluid and tissue exudates. In certain embodiments, film 110 may be cured by the plasma application and thus hardened to mechanically stabilize the treatment area. The curing may enhance adhesion to the tissue and resistance to fluids, and determine the degree of strength and permeability of the welded film.

Optionally, the at least one first processor is configured to modulate a duty cycle based on the gas flow rate in the plasma formation zone. Optionally, the energy emitter is an RF electrode and wherein the at least one processor is configured to modulate the RF carrier frequency. Optionally, the carrier frequency is about 2 MHz. Optionally, the at least one processor is configured to modulate a duty cycle based on the carrier frequency of the energy emitter. Optionally, the at least one processor is configured to modulate a duty cycle based on the plasma distance from the treatment surface. In accordance with another embodiment, gas flow shutter for flow determination in each tip. A tube (or other shaped passage) in the way of the gas to the plasma formation zone is provided, where the passage of the gas is confined to a specific flow in a specific pressure that is adjusted using a thin tube that is located in the gas entrance to the tip. This enables working with one input pressure but different gas flows for different plasma tips. This saves the need for an expensive gas flow controller (MFC). A “recipe” of plasma parameters where one of the parameters is a defined duration of welding. This duration defines the plasma dosage for the specific welding segment. After the time has passed, the plasma shuts off, there is a pre-defined waiting time where the plasma can't be ignited again and then, upon pressing the button, the plasma is ignited again for welding of the next segment. (This option is mainly for the WideTip). A simple conductive rod (metal or plastic covered with metal) that is structured in a way that will fit the plasma tip exactly to ignite the plasma at first ignition (where its ignition is difficult). The rod is configured to reach the plasma inner tube where the RF exciter is located from the outside (the best location to ignite the plasma). The rod has “stoppers” that let it be inserted perfectly to the right location and not pass it. Optionally, a shower head is provided that is configured to maintain positive pressure in the side of the gas entrance and by that distributing the gas uniformly (lower surface of holes than gas entrance surface). A plate with holes that enables the gas to pass uniformly and be distributed to the plasma region. In order to receive good distribution, the “shower head” need to be configured to maintain positive pressure in the proximal side (close to the gas source). This is achieved by having the total surface of the holes in the shower head smaller than the surface of the gas entrance conduit. The equation is: R1/n1/2>R2, where: R1—Gas conduct radius, n—Shower head number of holes, R2—Shower head holes radius. In order to overcome the above mentioned problem of moisture, reinforcement of the BioWedling film is needed. One option to solve the problem is a series of lines (“bridges”) that are connected to the adhesive plasters from both sides and add mechanical strength. Shown previously herewith. The reinforcement can be made of a different material as a medical plaster (i.e.—Steristrip), synthetic fibers or the chitosan itself but after “heating”. Heating lines are used to improve the physical properties of the material, properties such as tensile strength and elasticity when the film comes in contact with the patient's blood. Optionally, the reinforcement lines are in the width of between 1-3 mm. Optionally, the distance between two proximate heating lines is between 3-10 mm.
