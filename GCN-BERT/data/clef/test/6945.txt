This application claims priority to European patent application No. 12191401.4 filed on Nov. 6, 2012, the whole content of this application being incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. The present invention relates to a method for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide using a catalyst comprising at least one catalytically active metal. Hydrogen peroxide is a highly important commercial product widely used as a bleaching agent in the textile or paper manufacturing industry, a disinfecting agent and basic product in the chemical industry and in the peroxide compound production reactions (sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate, metallic peroxides or percarboxyl acids), oxidation (amine oxide manufacture), epoxidation and hydroxylation (plasticizing and stabilizing agent manufacture). Commercially, the most common method to produce hydrogen peroxide is the Auto Oxidation (AO) process. In this process, hydrogen and oxygen react to form hydrogen peroxide by the alternate oxidation and reduction of alkylated anthraquinones in organic solvents. A significant disadvantage of this process is that it is costly and produces a significant amount of by-products that must be removed from the process. One highly attractive alternative to the Auto Oxidation (AO) process (because it can be called a “green” process) is the production of hydrogen peroxide directly by reacting hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of metal catalysts supported on various oxides such as silica as a catalyst carrier. However, in these processes, when a catalyst based on silica as carrier is used for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, the reaction product, i.e., hydrogen peroxide was not efficiently produced since the production of water as a by-product was very high and even higher than the hydrogen peroxide production after a certain period of time. The use of barium sulfate as support for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide has not been broadly studied up to now. Solvay patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,447,706 published in 1993 describes the use for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide of a catalyst based on pure palladium or on a combination of palladium with at least one other noble metal. Said metal is impregnated on a support comprising at least one compound selected from the group consisting of sulfates and phosphates of alkaline-earth metals. The alkaline-earth metal is selected from the group consisting of magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium. In a special embodiment, barium sulfate is preferred. This catalyst shows very good results in hydrogen peroxide synthesis (up to 4.8 % Wt hydrogen peroxide in water). But unfortunately, studies showed that they possess bad mechanical characteristics (fine particles, less than 100 microns and sticky in presence of humidity). Ellis and co-workers (Applied Catalysis B, 42 (2003) 203-211) summarized (in Table 1) all the examples described in the Solvay patent U.S. Pat. No. 5,447,706, without adding new data. Hutchings and co-workers (Green Chemistry, 2008, 10, 388-394) have compared the results obtained with the catalyst described in the Solvay patent (U.S. Pat. No. 5,447,706) with other catalysts (Pd on titania, Pd/Au on titania or active carbon . . . ). They confirmed the good results described in the Solvay patent and concluded that the conditions described in the Solvay patent are well-adapted to monometallic supported Pd catalysts. Although the above catalysts having barium sulfate as support show good results in the direct synthesis (DS) of hydrogen peroxide, studies have proved that said catalysts were fragile and have a very high attrition. Another important drawback was the use a large amount of inorganic acid like o-phosphoric acid for example, to maintain the pH between 0 and 4. In the examples of the Solvay patent, the classical H3PO4 concentration used is 1.6 M which means extended cost and possible corrosion problems. In CN1817838, barium sulfate is described as support for catalysts used in hydrogen peroxide production with anthraquinone. It is not described as catalyst for the DS of hydrogen peroxide. The present invention aims at providing further catalysts, in particular catalysts suitable for the industrial preparation of hydrogen peroxide preferably by direct synthesis, which do not exhibit the above drawbacks, in particular which show a better mechanical resistance and which allow to reduce the amount of inorganic acid required for the DS of hydrogen peroxide at high concentration. To that end, the present invention relates to a catalyst comprising at least one catalytically active metal selected from elements in Groups 7 to 11, wherein the catalytically active metal is supported on a carrier comprising at least one compound selected from the group consisting of sulfates and phosphates of alkaline-earth metals, and wherein said compound is precipitated on the carrier. More particularly, the invention relates to a method for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide which uses such a catalyst. The catalytically active metal which may be used in the catalyst of the present invention can be selected by a person skilled in the art according to the intended use of the catalyst. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the catalyst comprises at least one metal selected from among the platinum group comprised of ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, platinum, or any combination of these metals. In a more preferred embodiment, the catalyst comprises palladium or a combination of palladium with another metal (for example, platinum or gold). The amount of catalytically active metal supported on the carrier can vary in a broad range, but is preferably comprised from 0.001 to 10 wt. %, more preferably from 0.1 to 5 wt. % and most preferably from 0.4 to 3 wt. %, each based on the total weight of the carrier. In the catalyst according to the invention, the catalytically active metal is preferably present at least partly in reduced form. In the context of that embodiment of the present invention, a metal in reduced form means metal atoms having the oxidization level 0 or lower, such as Pd0 or Pd hydride. Any suitable support material can be used as carrier in the catalyst according to the invention. For example, the support material can be an inorganic or organic material. As inorganic materials, inorganic oxides can be used. For example, the inorganic oxide can be selected from elements in Groups 2 to 14, such as SiO2, Al2O3, zeolites, B2O3, GeO2, Ga2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, MgO, and mixtures thereof. The preferred inorganic oxide is SiO2. In one embodiment, the support material used in the invention has a large specific surface area of for example above 20 m2/g calculated by the BET method, preferably greater than 100 m2/g. The pore volume of the support material can be for example in the range 0.1 to 3 ml/g. Typically, the mean particle size of the support ranges from 50 μm to a few mm, preferably from 60 to 210 μm for slurry catalysts. In the case of fix bed catalysts, the particle size ranges preferably from 500 μm to 5 mm. The support materials used can essentially be amorphous like silica gel or can be comprised of an orderly structure of mesopores, such as MCM-41, MCM-48, SBA-15, or a crystalline structure, like a zeolite. Alternatively the support material can be an organic material, such as an organic resin or active carbon. As organic resin, any known ion exchange resin can be exemplified. Suitable resins can, for example, be polystyrene resins. As active carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphite or carbon black can be used. According to the invention, at least one compound chosen from the sulfates or the phosphates of alkaline-earth metals, or a mixture thereof, is precipitated on the carrier. Sulfate or phosphate is intended to designate an alkaline-earth metal salt which contains the neutral sulfate (SO42−), monohydrogensulfate or acidic sulfate (HSO4−), neutral orthophosphate (PO43−), monohydrogenorthophosphate (HPO42−) or dihydrogenorthophosphate (H2PO4−) group. All alkaline-earth metals are suitable as long as their sulfate and/or phosphate is insoluble in aqueous or alcoholic (ethanol, methanol) solution and, preferably, in acidic solutions. It is advantageous for the alkaline-earth metal to be chosen from magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium. The neutral sulfate of barium (BaSO4) is particularly preferred because of its low solubility in the above mentioned solutions. Generally, barium sulfate forms an inhomogeneous coating (like stain or plates) on the support particle, which reaches a thickness of 10 to 20 μm typically. The barium content of the catalyst according to the above preferred embodiment, measured by ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry), is preferably higher than 3 % wt, more preferably higher than 5 % wt. (with respect to the total weight of the catalyst) for having good selectivity and productivity at the same time. The invention also relates to catalysts as described above wherein the catalytically active metal is palladium or the combination of palladium with another metal, the inorganic oxide is SiO2, and the alkaline-earth metal compound is barium sulfate. It also relates to the use of such catalysts for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide. The present invention furthermore relates to a method for preparing the above described catalyst. In a first embodiment of this method, in a first step, at least one sulfate or phosphate of an alkaline-earth metal is precipitated on the carrier (as defined above and with the same preferred embodiments), and in a second step, a catalytically active metal selected from elements of Groups 7 to 11 is deposited. Preferably, solutions of halides (preferably chlorides) of the alkaline-earth metal (preferably barium) and of the catalytically active metal (preferably palladium) are used respectively in the first and the second step of the method of the invention, and preferably as aqueous solutions. Preferably, phosphoric acid or sulfuric acid is used in combination with the alkaline-earth metal halide in order to precipitate the sulfate or phosphate. For instance, barium sulfate is preferably generated by combining solutions of barium ions and sulfate ions (salts or acids). In practice, mixing a barium salt solution with sulfuric acid gives good results. Preferably, the barium salt is a halide. Barium chloride gives good results and is easily available commercially. The deposition of the catalytically active metal onto the carrier can be performed using any of the known preparation techniques for supported metal catalyst, e.g. impregnation, adsorption, ionic exchange, etc. For the impregnation, it is possible to use any kind of inorganic or organic salt of the metal to be impregnated that is soluble in the solvent used. Suitable salts are, for example, halides such as chloride, acetate, nitrate, oxalate, etc. For example, the metal can be deposited by dipping the carrier in a solution of metal halides followed by reduction. Generally, the catalysts of the invention do not require calcination to be effective, which is advantageous from an energetic point of view. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, silica is first contacted with sulfuric acid and with a solution of barium chloride, and then, contacted with a solution of palladium chloride. After the metal has been deposited on the support material, the product is recovered, for example by filtration, washed and dried. Subsequently, the metal deposited on the support is preferably (at least partially) reduced, for example by using hydrogen at high temperature. This hydrogenation step can be carried out for example at a temperature from 100° C. to 300° , preferably from 120° C. to 200° C. for 1 to 10 hours, preferably for 2 to 6 hours. In a second embodiment, the catalyst according to the invention may be synthesized by a sol-gel method, by co-precipitating a precursor of the carrier (for instance TEOS or tetraethyl orthosilicate which is a precursor of SiO2) with a halide (preferably chloride) of the alkaline-earth metal (preferably barium), preferably under an acidic pH. The catalysts according to the invention are suitable for catalyzing various reactions, including for example hydrogenation or cyclization reactions. Preferably the catalyst is used for catalyzing the synthesis of hydrogen peroxide, either by the AO route or by DS, in particular for catalyzing the DS of hydrogen peroxide. Hence, in another aspect, the invention is also directed to the use of the catalyst according to the invention in production of hydrogen peroxide. In the process of the invention, hydrogen and oxygen (as purified oxygen or air) are reacted continuously over a catalyst in the presence of a liquid solvent in a reactor to generate a liquid solution of hydrogen peroxide. The catalyst is used for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide in a three-phase system: the catalyst (solid) is put in a solvent (water or alcohol like methanol) and the gases (H2, O2 and an inert gas) are bubbled in the suspension in presence of stabilizing additives (halides and/or inorganic acid: see below). The above DS process for producing hydrogen peroxide may comprise reacting hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of the catalyst according to the invention in a reactor. The process of this invention can be carried out in continuous, semi-continuous or discontinuous mode, by the conventional methods, for example, in a stirred tank reactor with the catalyst particles in suspension, a basket-type stirred tank reactor, a fixed-bed reactor, etc. Once the reaction has reached the desired conversion levels, the catalyst can be separated by different known processes, such as filtration if the catalyst in suspension is used, which would afford the possibility of its subsequent reuse. In the case of the stirred tank reactor, the amount of catalyst used is that necessary to obtain a concentration of 0.01 to 10 wt. % catalyst (regarding the total weight of solvent and catalyst) and preferably 0.02 to 5 wt. %. The concentration of the obtained hydrogen peroxide according to the invention is generally higher than 2 wt. %, preferably higher than 4 wt. %, most preferably higher than 7 wt. %. In addition to their catalytic properties for the reaction of direct synthesis of the hydrogen peroxide, the catalysts of the invention are unfortunately also over-hydrogenation and decomposition catalysts of the peroxide formed. It is consequently advantageous for the liquid phase in which the synthesis is carried out, to contain a compound capable of selectively poison the hydrogen peroxide decomposition and over-hydrogenation sites present on the surface of the catalyst. Halide ions are good representatives of these compounds. Their optimum concentration must be determined by means of laboratory tests within the capability of the person skilled in the art. This concentration must be sufficient in order to achieve poisoning the majority of the decomposition sites of the catalyst and, at the same time, not too high in order to avoid as much as possible the oxidation reaction of the halide ion by the hydrogen peroxide. Chloride, bromide and iodide ions are suitable to inhibit the decomposition sites of the catalyst. The bromide ion has given the best results, especially when present in a concentration between 0.05 and 3 mmol/l of liquid phase and, preferably, between 0.1 and 2 mmol/l. It is also advantageous for the liquid phase to contain in addition an acid with the aim of inhibiting spontaneous non-catalytic decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide. However, when the acid concentration is too high, the solubility of the gases in the liquid phase decreases and the acid can react with the hydrogen peroxide present. As suitable acids, mention may be made of sulfuric acid, nitric acid and orthophosphoric acid. Orthophosphoric acid is preferred. However, the catalysts of the invention allow using the inorganic acid in an amount of 0.2 M/l or less, even of 0.1 M/l or less, which enables lowering the costs and corrosion problems while still providing good synthesis results. The temperature of the reaction is normally chosen at a value of between −5 and 50° C. and, preferably, between 0 and 20° C. The pressure chosen is greater than atmospheric pressure and is generally between 1 and 150 bar and, preferably, between 25 and 100 bar. The invention will now be illustrated in more detail by way of the following examples which are not intended to be construed as being limiting.

In fact, Ba loadings below 3% wt give a rather high experimental error: see FIG. 1 attached, which represents graphically for examples 3 and 6 to 9, the evolution of the final H2O2 concentration in function of the Ba loading. This is why in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the barium content of the catalyst, measured by ICP-OES, is higher than 3% wt, more preferably higher than 5% wt.
