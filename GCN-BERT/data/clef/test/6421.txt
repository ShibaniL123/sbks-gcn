Medical air supply system Field of the invention Aspects of the invention relate to a warming blanket used in a medical treatment environment to control the body temperature of a patient, as well as warming blanket connectors and control systems for providing heated air to the warming blanket. Other aspects relate to a filter for a medical air supply system to be used in a medical treatment environment, such as with a warming blanket, to control the body temperature of a patient. Background of the invention Researchers have reported that hypothermia during surgery is associated with a higher wound infection rate and a longer period of stay in hospital. It was observed that cold patients tend to complain of greater pain, requiring a greater use of pain killers. Each dose of pain relieving drug equated to an additional thirty minutes in recovery, thus increasing the costs and length of stay of the visit. As a way to prevent or reduce this phenomena, researchers discovered that a patient receiving ambient body temperature from an external means would recover in a shorter period of time, than would otherwise be expected and without complications. This resulted in the development of convective warming blankets in which a convective warming system delivers convective warm air from a blower to a disposable blanket which distributed warm air directly onto the patient's skin surface. The convective warming systems were thermostatically controlled to provide a continuous flow of warm air at a predetermined temperature of about 38°C. The air pumping systems generally have a HEPA filter of about 0.2 micron particle size to deliver warm sterile air to the warming blanket. The warming blanket distributes air over the covered areas of the patient through openings in the patient's side of the blanket. The blanket consists of layers of plastic bonded to a non-woven material, and though more expensive to produce, blankets can also be constructed from layers of non-woven to woven material. On warming blankets used in operating rooms, a pressure sensitive, non-irritating tape provides a seal between the blanket and the surgical site. These blankets once inflated, generally hug the patient contours of the body to provide maximum performance. There are a large number of different warming blankets available. Many of these warming blankets have different operating conditions. Warming blankets may be of different sizes, have different exhaust capabilities, or may be designed to accommodate different air flows, pressures, or temperatures. Often an operator needs to check the operating conditions of the warming blanket prior to use. This can be a time consuming process. Furthermore, once the operator has confirmed the operating conditions, these conditions need to be manually input into the control unit. Thus, the operator will manually need to set the temperature and pressure of air for the warming blanket. Problems can arise if this data is incorrectly entered, particularly if the input operating conditions are outside the intended operating range of the warming blanket. Another issue with these prior art systems is that many systems use a single blower that is operated at a standard airflow rate irrespective of the type of warming blanket that is connected to the blower. In some cases, this can result in over-pressurisation of the warming blanket as the blower is operating at a speed that is greater than necessary which can lead to overheating, energy wastage, and can lower the operating life of the system. In other cases, the standard rate of operation may be too slow, resulting in under-pressurisation of the warming blanket. While the blower speed can be manually adjusted, in many systems the blower speed is tied to the temperature of the air being provided to the warming blanket. Therefore, adjusting the blower speed often also alters the temperature. While the above discussion of air supply is discussed in relation to warming blankets, this discussion is not intended to be limited to warming blankets. There are a number of medical devices which require a supply of air during operation. Air is also usually supplied to these devices via a blower unit. Many of the issues above discussed in relation to a blower unit for supplying air to a medical warming blanket apply to these other medical devices also. It is an object of the invention to provide a means for addressing at least some of the above mentioned problems of the prior art. Reference to any prior art in the specification is not an acknowledgment or suggestion that this prior art forms part of the common general knowledge in any jurisdiction or that this prior art could reasonably be expected to be understood, regarded as relevant, and/or combined with other pieces of prior art by a skilled person in the art. Summary of the invention In one aspect of the invention there is provided a medical device air supply conduit including: a first end including a coupling element to couple the first end of the conduit to an inlet of the medical device, a sensor for sensing a parameter associated with the medical device and communicating the parameter to a control unit, the control unit providing a supply of heated air through the conduit to the medical device, the heated air being supplied according to a pre-set property determined by the parameter; and a second end that is coupled to, or is able to be coupled to the control unit to supply the heated air at the pre-set property to the medical device. The blower may be integrally formed with the control unit, or a separate component the operation of which is controlled by the control unit. Where the blower is a separate component of the operation which is controlled by the control unit, the second end is coupled to a blower associated with the control unit. It is preferred that the medical device is a medical warming blanket. Ideally the parameter is a specific indicator that is associated with the medical device, such as a medical warming blanket, is to identify the type of medical device that is being used, or to designate the intended operation or use of the medical device. The parameter may be a number of different factors that can be determined by the sensor in the conduit. The parameter may be electrical, optical signal, physical, or mechanical in nature. By way of example, the parameter can be a signal provided by an electrical chip located in the warming blanket, such as an RFID tag or other proximity data tag; the parameter can be an indicia which is registered by the sensor, for example a barcode, a QR code, a letter, a number, a pattern, or a colour; or the parameter can be an arrangement of electrical contacts between the medical device and the conduit. The skilled addressee will appreciate that there are a number of ways in which features of the medical device may be arranged so that these features may be sensed when connected with a conduit including a sensor. Preferably, the parameter is a colour of at least a portion of the medical device and the sensor is a colour sensor. The use of a colour is particularly advantageous as it is easy for a user to readily identify, and can either be easily detected by an appropriate sensor or correspond with an electrical indicator on the conduit which is detected by an appropriate sensor. In an embodiment, the pre-set property is selected from the group consisting of: an preprogrammed operation, a volumetric flow rate of the air, an air pressure, a temperature of the air, or a combination thereof. The pre-programmed operation may be a change in air pressure and/or temperature with time. For example, in the case of a medical warming blanket, the pre-programmed operation may be a turbo boost setting for boosting initial air flow and warming. Turbo boost is a function that increases the temperature and/or air flow for a period of time, for example the turbo boost function may increase the temperature to 40-50QC, say 46°C for a period of 10 minutes. Once the conduit connects the medical device and the control device, the sensor on the conduit senses a parameter on the medical device and relays that information to the control unit. The control unit then determines an appropriate operating strategy. The particular operating strategy adopted is specific to the sensed parameter. For example, when the parameter is a colour, different colours correspond with different pre-set properties. Some colours may be indicative of a medical device, such as a medical warming blanket, that operate at low or high temperatures, low or high pressures, low or high air flow rates, or some colours may be indicative of particular operating strategies - for example an initial temperature and/or flow rate for a first period of time and then a different temperature and/or flow rate (which may be higher or lower) for a second period of time. A user may select an appropriate warming blanket based on a displayed colour, the colour indicating the desired pre-set air flow properties. This is advantageous as the control unit is able to select the correct operating criteria for a specific medical device. This prevents or mitigates the blower being operated at a higher throughput than required which minimises energy waste and extends the life of the blower. Thus, the system becomes more energy efficient and eco-friendly. In an embodiment, the medical device air supply conduit further includes a cable that extends from the sensor to the second end of the conduit, the second end of the conduit including a cable interface for connecting the cable to the control unit. Thus the cable is able to transmit information directly from the sensor to the control unit. In a further embodiment, the sensor and control unit may communicate wirelessly. In an embodiment, the control unit identifies a make and/or model of the medical device based on the parameter. In the case of a medical warming blanket, the control unit includes information regarding the make and/or model of many of the commercially available warming blankets. Ideally, the control unit includes an operating strategy based on the make and/or model of the warming blankets, for example a pre-set air temperature and pressure. The control unit may also include information such as the maximum and minimum operating temperatures and pressures. In this way, the control unit can prevent operation of the warming blanket outside of the range defined by these maximum and minimum temperatures. This may be particularly advantageous with warming blankets of different sizes. For example, a large sized warming blanket may have a first corresponding parameter, a medium sized warming blanket may have a second corresponding parameter, and a small warming blanket may have a third corresponding parameter. As discussed above, the parameters may be colours. Therefore, in an example, the large warming blanket has a red indicia, the medium warming blanket has a yellow indicia, and the small warming blanket has a green indicia. Additionally, a user is able to quickly and easily identify the different medical devices based on the colour indicia. Furthermore, once the conduit is connected to the medical device, the sensor in the conduit identifies the colour indicia and communicates this to the control unit. The control unit stores information that includes an association between the colour indicia and the type of medical device. The control unit also has information as to the appropriate air flow rates, pressures, temperatures, or operating procedures for each type of medical device. Once the coloured indicium has been communicated to the control unit, the control unit is able to select the appropriate pre-set property for the air, so that air can be supplied in accordance with the operating conditions for that medical device. In yet another embodiment the first end further includes an outlet temperature sensor to measure the air temperature at the outlet of the conduit, and/or at the inlet to the warming blanket or other medical device. The temperature sensor may be located on an interior surface of the air supply conduit or alternatively, the sensor may be located within the inlet of the warming blanket and configured to interface with the control unit on coupling the first end of the conduit with the inlet of the warming blanket. The sensor may further comprise the outlet temperature sensor, or the outlet temperature sensor may be a separate component from the sensor and not integrated with the sensor. Preferably the sensor and the temperature sensor are located on the same printed circuit board (PCB) chip. That is, it is preferred that the temperature sensor is located on a shared printed circuit board with the sensor. The outlet temperature sensor allows the temperature of the air at the first end of the conduit to be measured and/or monitored. The air temperature may be communicated to the control unit via a communication means, such as via the cable. The control unit and/or sensor may maintain a log of the air temperature measurements. In the event that the air temperature falls outside the set point temperature, the control unit may be configured to adjust the speed of the blower, or to alter the temperature of the air by, for example, adjusting the temperature and/or energy supplied to air heating elements. If the air temperature increases beyond the set point temperature, the control is configured to adjust reduce the temperature to the set point. If the temperature does not reduce to the set point, then the control unit can be configured to provide an alarm to alert the user. In certain embodiments, the control unit is configured to disable heating means and/or the supply of air. In yet a further embodiment, the second end includes an inlet temperature sensor. This allows the temperature of the air to be monitored at the inlet of the conduit. The second end may include the inlet temperature sensor, for example, on an interior surface of the air supply conduit. Alternatively, the inlet temperature sensor may be located within a connection port of the blower unit. Preferably the inlet temperature sensor is located adjacent to the heating elements. The control unit and/or sensor may maintain a log of the air temperature measurements. In the event that the air temperature falls outside the set point temperature, the control unit may be configured to adjust the speed of the blower, or to alter the temperature of the air by, for example, adjusting the temperature and/or energy supplied to air heating elements. If the air temperature increases beyond the set point temperature, the control is configured to adjust reduce the temperature to the set point. If the temperature does not reduce to the set point, then the control unit can be configured to provide an alarm to alert the user. In certain embodiments, the control unit is configured to disable heating means and/or the supply of air. In yet another embodiment there is provided a conduit and/or system which includes both an inlet air temperature sensor and an outlet air temperature sensor as described above. The inlet and outlet air temperature sensors may be located on the second end and first end of the conduit respectively, in which case the outlet air temperature sensor may be integrated with the sensor or separate from the sensor. Alternatively, the outlet sensor may be located on an inlet portion of the warming blanket and/or the inlet sensor may be located within a connection port of the blower unit. In this embodiment, the inlet and outlet sensors may be used to monitor a temperature differential between the first end and the second end of the conduit. The control unit may be configured to alter the fan speed, and/or operation of the heating elements if the temperature differential falls outside the set point or set point band. In still a further aspect of the invention there is provided a medical device, such as a warming blanket, for coupling with the supply conduit as described above. In yet a further aspect of the invention there is provided a medical device including: an inlet for coupling with a first end of an air supply conduit, the air supply conduit to provide a supply of air to the medical device from a control unit; a parameter located in at least a portion of the warming blanket and configured to be sensed by a sensor in the first end of the air supply conduit and to be communicated to the control unit; wherein the heated air is supplied at a pre-set property determined by the parameter. Preferably the medical device is a warming blanket. In an embodiment, the inlet of the medical device includes: a coupling portion which couples with the first end of the air supply conduit, and a peripheral portion which extends around at least a part of the coupling portion, the peripheral portion arranged to communicate the parameter to the sensor. Preferably, the parameter is an indicia and the peripheral portion includes the indicia. More preferably, the indicia is a colour of at least a part of the peripheral portion. In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a control unit for providing air to a medical device, the control unit including: an air outlet coupled to, or able to be coupled to a second end of an air supply conduit; a receiver configured to receive information communicated from the air supply conduit that is indicative of a parameter of the medical device; wherein the control unit is configured to provide heated air supplied through the conduit to the medical device, the heated air having a pre-set property determined by the parameter. Preferably the medical device is a warming blanket. In an embodiment, the pre-set property is selected from the group consisting of: an preprogrammed operation, a volumetric flow rate of the air, an air pressure, a temperature of the air, or a combination thereof. In an embodiment, the outlet of the control unit includes the receiver. Preferably, the outlet of the control unit includes: a coupling portion which couples with the second end of the air supply conduit, and a peripheral portion adjacent to the coupling portion, the peripheral portion including the receiver, wherein the receiver receives information communicated from the second end of the conduit. In an embodiment, the receiver is a cable interface for connecting with a communication cable that extends from a sensor in the conduit to the second end of the conduit. The cable may be any suitable cable for transmitting a signal from the sensor to the second end of the conduit, the cable may be an electrical cable, or an optical cable. In an embodiment, the control unit identifies a make and/or model of the medical device based on the parameter. In an embodiment, the control unit includes the conduit. In another aspect of the invention there is provided a medical device for use with the control unit as previously defined. Preferably the medical device is a warming blanket. In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a medical device configured to be used with a control unit as previously defined, the medical device including a parameter to be communicated to the control unit. Preferably the medical device is a warming blanket. In various embodiments the control unit includes a touch screen. The touch screen provides a user interface that an operator may interact with. Depending on the parameter communicated to the control unit, a number of control options may be available to the operator. Such options may include manual temperature adjustment between set parameters, or manual adjustment of blower speed between set parameters. Furthermore, the display may provide information such as patient runtime, how long a particular blanket has been connected and/or used, current temperature, temperature history, average temperature for the patient runtime, boost time elapsed and/or remaining, on/off control, filter time warnings, and any error messages. Sensors may also be used to indicate filter life time use. The sensors can log the usage hours of the filters. Filters typically have 1000 to 2000 hours of use. The display unit will warn the operator when this time is almost complete and will alarm when the filter is no longer usable. In still another aspect of the invention there is provided a filter for a blower unit of a medical air supply system, the filter including: a parameter associated with at least a portion of the filter and configured to be sensed by a sensor in the blower unit and to be communicated to a control unit, the control unit configured to provide an output based on a measured variable associated with the parameter. Ideally the parameter is a specific indicator that is associated with the filter to identify the type of filter that is being used. The parameter may be a number of different factors that can be determined by the sensor in the conduit. The parameter may be electrical, optical signal, physical, or mechanical in nature. By way of example, the parameter can be a signal provided by an electrical chip located in the filter, such as microchip, an RFID tag or other proximity data tag; the parameter can be an indicia which is registered by the sensor, for example a barcode, a QR code, a letter, a number, a pattern, or a colour; or the parameter can be an arrangement of electrical contacts between the filter and the conduit. The skilled addressee will appreciate that there are a number of ways in which features of the filter may be arranged so as to be sensed when connected with a conduit including a sensor. In an embodiment, the parameter includes a unique identifier that corresponds to the filter. This allows a specific filter to be readily identified by the control unit and furthermore permits information, such as the measured variable to be associated with the specific filter. This is particularly advantageous where the measured variable is filter- specific, such as a record of usage hours. In an embodiment, the parameter is stored on a microchip and the sensor is able to read the parameter from the microchip. In certain embodiments, the logic of the microchip determines the output. Alternatively, the logic of the control unit determines the output. Preferably, the microchip includes at least three channels configured to communicate with the sensor, a first channel for receiving energy from the sensor, a second channel for transmitting data including the parameter to the control unit via the sensor, and a third channel for receiving data from the sensor. In an embodiment, the sensor is able to write data to the microchip, the microchip including writable memory to store data, corresponding to the measured variable, from the control unit. It is advantageous to store the measured variable, or for example a log of the measured variable, on the microchip so that if the filter is interfaced with another control unit then the measured variable or the log of the measured variable can be accessed directly from the microchip via the control unit. This allows, for example, the filter to be removed and placed into a different blower unit, or the blower unit itself to be connected to a different control unit while retaining information pertaining to the measured variable. In an embodiment, the microchip includes read only memory which provides operating information to the control unit. Such information may include information regarding maximum and/or minimum air flow rates through the filter, and maximum and/or minimum pressure drops across the filter. The skilled addressee will appreciate that other filter operating criteria may also be stored on the microchip and provided to the control unit. The measured variable may be a range of variables that are associated with filter usage. For example, in an embodiment, the measured variable is selected from the group consisting of an air flow rate across the filter, a pressure differential across the filter, filter temperature, air temperature across the filter, total hours of operation such as the total lifetime usage of the filter, time of current operation, and combinations thereof. The measured variable may be used to provide an indication of the performance of the filter. For example, if there is an increase in pressure differential across the filter, then the filter may need to be checked or replaced. It is preferred that the measured variable is a cumulative lifetime use of the filter. In an embodiment, the filter is a replaceable filter. In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a blower unit including a filter port adapted to receive a filter as described herein. In yet another aspect of the invention there is provided a blower unit including a filter as described herein. In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a blower unit of a medical air supply system, the blower unit including: a filter port to receive a filter; a sensor located to sense a parameter associated with at least a portion of the filter, the sensor configured to communicate the parameter to a control unit, wherein the control unit is configured to provide an output based on a measured variable associated with the parameter. In an embodiment, the parameter is stored on a microchip and the sensor is able to read the parameter from the microchip. Preferably the sensor includes at least three channels configured to communicate with the microchip, a first channel for providing energy to the microchip, a second channel for receiving data including the parameter from the microchip, and a third channel for transmitting data from the control unit to the microchip. In various embodiments, of the above aspects that relate to the blower unit, the blower unit may be configured so that it is inoperable unless the sensor detects the presence of the parameter. In still a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a medical air supply system including: a blower unit as described herein, and a control unit configured to provide the output based on the measured variable associated with the sensed parameter. In an embodiment, the control unit is further configured to prevent operation of the blower unless the sensor detects the presence of the parameter. This prevents the blower from operating if no filter is present. Thus for example, in the situation where the filter includes a microchip, if the sensor does not detect the presence of the microchip then the control unit will prevent the blower from operating. In one or more embodiments of the above-mentioned aspects, the measured variable is a time period that the sensor has sensed the parameter during operation. This allows the lifetime operation of the filter to be monitored. Typically filters have a life time of around 1000 to 2000 hours depending on the type of filter. As the filter approaches its maximum allowable operating lifetime it will need to be removed and replaced. In an embodiment, the control unit provides the output when the measured variable exceeds a first threshold value. For example, where a filter has a lifetime of 2000 hours, and the measured variable is the time period that the sensor has sensed the parameter, e.g. a measure of the lifetime operation of the filter, the first threshold value may be around 1800 hours. Once this threshold has been reached, the control unit generates an output. Preferably, the control unit provides a second output when the measured variable exceeds a second threshold value. The second value may for example be around 1900 hours. In one or more embodiments, the control unit is configured to prevent operation of the blower unit once the measured variable has reached a final threshold value. For example, with reference to a filter having a total lifetime of 2000 hours, the control unit may be configured to display a warning message to prompt a user to change the filter. Alternatively, the control unit may be configured to warn the user and prevent the blower from re-starting once the lifetime usage has reached or exceeded 2000 hours. In a further alternative, the control unit may be configured to warn the user and to terminate operation of the blower once lifetime usage has reached 2000 hours. In one or more embodiments of the above-mentioned aspects, the output is an alarm. The alarm may be a visual output such as flashing lights or the display of a warning message. Alternatively, or in addition, the alarm may be an audial output, such as an alert tone. The alarm is preferably displayed on a screen. In an embodiment, the control unit is configured to associate the parameter with a filter profile, the filter profile including a log of the measured variable. The log may include information relating to one or more measured variables during operation of the filter. The log may additionally include other information such as a record of the operation conditions that have been used, such as set air flow rate, set temperatures, etc. Preferably, the log is stored in memory of the control unit. Alternatively, the log may be written to and stored in the writable memory of the microchip. The log may be downloadable from the control unit or via the control unit to a computer by means known to those skilled in the art. This may be useful for maintenance purposes, or to troubleshoot operation of the blower unit. In an embodiment, the filter is removable from the blower unit, so that at the end of a lifetime of the filter, the filter can be removed and replaced with a new filter having a different parameter, and the control system is configured to identify the new parameter and to associate the new parameter with a new filter profile including a new log of the measured variable. In an embodiment, the control unit provides the output when the measured variable exceeds a first threshold value. The determination of whether the measured variable exceeds the first threshold value may be calculated by the internal logic of the microchip or by the logic of the control unit. It will be understood that in certain cases, for example when the measured variable is within the threshold value, there may be no specific visual or audial output, the output is simply the absence of a warning and/or that the blower unit continues to operate. Preferably, when the first threshold value is exceeded the output is an alarm. More preferably, the control unit provides a second output when the measured variable exceeds a second threshold value. As above, this may be determined by the microchip or the control unit. Even more preferably, when the second threshold value is exceeded, the output is a second alarm. In an embodiment, the control unit is configured to associate the parameter with a filter profile, the filter profile including a log of the measured variable. In an alternative embodiment, the microchip is configured to associate the parameter with a filter profile, the filter profile including a log of the measured variable. In both cases, the log may be stored on the control unit, the microchip, or both. Preferably the log is stored on the microchip so that if the filter is inserted into another blower or associated with another control unit, the new blower or control unit can download the log from the microchip. In an embodiment, the control unit includes a display, the display operable to provide a visual output of the measured variable. Preferably, the display is a touchscreen including display icons that can be selected by a user to provide the visual output of the measured variable. Preferably, the display is a touchscreen including command icons that can be selected by a user to control the operation of the blower unit. In still a further aspect of the invention there is provided a medical device system including: a medical air supply system as described herein, and a medical device to receive air from the air supply system via an air supply conduit. In yet a further aspect of the invention there is provided the use of a medical air supply system as described herein to provide air to a medical device. In an embodiment, the control unit includes a display, the display operable to provide a visual output of the measured variable. Preferably the display is a touchscreen including display icons that can be selected by a user to provide the visual output of the measured variable. Alternatively, or in addition, the display is a touchscreen including command icons that can be selected by a user to control the operation of the blower unit. In another embodiment, the blower further includes a motor, the operation of which may be adjusted in response to a temperature reading. The temperature may be the motor temperature, or alternatively, the temperature across the filter may be used to control motor speed. Thus, in one or more embodiments, a measured variable is the temperature across the motor, and the control unit is configured to alter the motor speed based on the measured temperature to prevent overheating. If the temperature across the filter continues to increase, the control unit may additionally be configured to stop the motor from operating once a maximum threshold value is reached. In one or more embodiments, the medical device requiring a supply of air is a medical warming blanket. In yet another aspect of the invention, there is provided a medical warming blanket system including: the medical air supply system as described, and a medical warming blanket to receive air from the air supply system via the conduit. In still another aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of the medical air supply system as described, to provide air to a medical warming blanket. Further aspects of the present invention and further embodiments of the aspects described in the preceding paragraphs will become apparent from the following description, given by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings. Brief description of the drawings Figure 1 is a schematic view of a warming blanket system. Figure 2 is a close up view of a connection between a conduit and warming blanket. Figure 3 is an isometric cross-sectional view of a coupling element of a conduit for coupling to an inlet port of a medical device, such as a warming blanket. Figure 4 shows an integrated unit containing both a blower unit and control unit. Figure 5 shows air outlet port. Figures 6, 7, and 8 illustrate an embodiment of a filter unit. Figures 9, 10, 1 1 , and 12 are a schematic illustration of an embodiment of a filter unit. Figure 13, 14, and 15 provide an illustration of an embodiment of a control unit for use with the warming blanket system. Detailed description of the embodiments In Figure 1 , a warming blanket system 100 is shown, the warming blanket system includes a warming blanket 102 having an air supply conduit 104 connected. The air supply conduit 104 is inserted into the inlet in the warming blanket 102 and held in place by the frictional contact between the air supply conduit 104 and the inlet. The air supply conduit 104 is provided with a supply of warm air from a control unit 106 that includes a blower. The warming blanket is generally provided with a number of perforations in its underside so that the warm air entering the warming blanket inflates the warming blanket to form a semi-elliptical or semi-circular shape over the patient with warm air being blown through the perforations in the underside of the warming blanket to warm the patient underneath the blanket. Figure 2 shows a close up view of an embodiment of a connection formed between a conduit and a warming blanket. The conduit 200 connects at one end to a control unit that has a blower (not shown), and at the other end to the warming blanket 202 (partial view shown). The conduit includes a coupling element 204 which forms a connection with an inlet 206 of the warming blanket. In this figure, the connection to the inlet of the warming blanket is via a reciprocal coupling element on the warming blanket. The coupling element 204 includes an external sensor 208 that is mounted to an external surface of the coupling element 204. While the sensor 208 is shown as being an external sensor, in other embodiments the sensor 208 may be integrated into the coupling assembly. In any event, the sensor 208 is able to sense a parameter associated with the warming blanket. In this case, the sensor 208 is configured to sense a parameter on a collar 210 of the warming blanket inlet 206. Other arrangements of the sensor with respect to the conduit will be apparent to those skilled in the art. For example, in alternative embodiments the sensor may be an internal sensor that is located inside the conduit, such as mounted to an internal wall of the conduit. In this embodiment, the collar 210 is coloured. The sensor 208 senses the colour of the collar 210 and reports this to the control unit (not shown) via a cable 212 which runs from the sensor 208 and is connectable to the control unit. In preferred embodiments, the sensor is a photo sensor. In this embodiment, cable 212 is shown as external to the conduit 200. However, in other embodiments the cable may be integrated into the wall of the conduit or may run internally within the conduit; this may be the case where the sensor is mounted on an internal wall of the conduit. This arrangement is advantageous as locating the sensors and cables internally prevents exposure of these items to external wear and tear. In other embodiments, the system may do away with the cable 212, and the sensor 208 may instead include a wireless transmitter for communicating the sensed parameter to the control unit. Figure 3 is an isometric cross-sectional view of a coupling element 300 of a conduit (not shown) for coupling to an inlet port of a medical device, such as a warming blanket, the inlet port having a parameter to be sensed, which in this case is a coloured indicia. The skilled addressee will appreciate that the coupling element may be used to couple between an air supply conduit and other medical device requiring a supply of air having a parameter to be sensed (such as a coloured indicia). The coupling element 300 includes an internal mount 302 that has a sensor. The sensor 304 on the coupling element 300 includes a colour determining sensor, such as a photo sensor. On connection of the coupling element 300 to the warming blanket, the sensor 304 aligns with and detects the coloured indicia on the inlet port of the warming blanket. That is, the colour determining sensor is configured to determine the colour of the coloured indicia (such as that of the coloured collar 210 of Figure 2) and to relay this information to a control unit (also not shown) via the electrical cable. This information is relayed to a control unit via, for example, a cable that runs along or within the conduit to the blower that supplies the air through the conduit. Based on this information, the control unit is able to identify the type of warming blanket that is being used. The sensor 304 also includes a temperature sensor to determine the air temperature at the outlet of the conduit as it passes through the inlet of the warming blanket or other medical device. If the air temperature drifts away from the temperature set point, the control unit is configured to display an alarm to a user, and may adjust the air flow rate, fan speed, temperature or energy supplied to the heating elements. The control unit is also configured to deactivate the heating elements and/or fan if the temperature exceeds a maximum threshold value or falls below a minimum threshold value. Figure 4 shows view of an integrated unit containing both a blower unit and control unit. The unit includes a touch screen display which displays information about the operating status of the device as well as displaying selectable icons which a user can activate by touching. Icons may be actuated to adjust the air flow rate, temperature, or other process parameters, or to select pre-programmed or automated functions. The operation of the touch screen will be discussed in more detail below. The integrated unit also includes a filter 310 which filters air from the outside environment as it is drawn into the device by the blower unit, and a connection port or air outlet port 312 of the blower/control unit to connect with the second end of the conduit. The air outlet port 312 is shown in greater detail in Figure 5. Figure 5 shows air outlet port 312. In this embodiment, the air outlet port 312 includes a temperature sensor 314 for monitoring the air temperature to the inlet of the conduit. This information is relayed to the control unit which can adjust operating parameters if the air temperature drifts away from the set point value. Alternatively, or in addition, the control unit can calculate and monitor an air temperature differential between the inlet of the conduit and the outlet of the conduit, and adjust operating parameters if the temperature differential is greater than the desired or maximum allowable differential. In all cases, there may be a number of set points that are monitored. A first set point, indicating a small deviation from a desired set point may result in the display of a visual and/or audial alarm. A second set point may result in the control unit adjusting various operating parameters to return the system to the set point. A third set point may result in the control unit stopping the blower unit, or alternatively an element of the blower unit such as the fan or the heating elements. In preferred embodiments, the control unit includes a touch screen which can display icons that allow the operation of the warming blanket to be controlled. For example, there may be icons on the touch screen which can be touched to increase air supply speed, pressure, temperature etc. The range of temperatures, speeds, and/or pressures may be specific to different types of warming blankets. The control unit, having identified the type of warming blanket may limit the control options available to that specific warming blanket. For example, a warming blanket for a child may have a maximum air supply rate that is lower than a warming blanket for an adult. In such cases, the control unit will only permit the air supply to be increased up to the maximum for that specific warming blanket. The same applies for other parameters such as air temperature and/or air pressure. Additionally, there may be automated or pre-programmed operating modes, such as a turbo-boost function. These automated or pre-programmed operating modes may be warming blanket specific, in which case these modes will only be selectable if the correct type of warming blanket is detected. For example, the control unit may provide a turbo boost function for an adult sized warming blanket, and a turbo boost function for a child sized warming blanket. However, the control unit will only display the turbo boost function that relates to the particular warming blanket that has been connected. By way of example, if an adult sized warming blanket includes a green colour tag and a child sized warming blanket includes a red colour tag, and then on connection of the adult warming blanket, the sensor detects the green tag and relays that information to the control unit. The control unit identifies the warming blanket as an adult sized warming blanket and provides icons that represent functions to control the adult sized warming blanket, including the turbo boost function for the adult sized warming blanket. In this case, the turbo boost function for the child sized blanket is wither not provided, or alternatively is not selectable by a user. Figures 6, 7, and 8 illustrate another embodiment in which a filter 600, for insertion into a blower unit, is fitted with a parameter, in this case a microchip 602. A corresponding sensor, in this case a microchip sensor 604 is fitted to the body of the blower unit 606. The microchip 602 is mounted to the filter 600 by mounting portion 608 and the microchip sensor 604 is mounted to a body of the blower unit 606 by mounting portion 610. The microchip sensor 604 is configured to read and write information to the microchip 602. The blower unit is configured to connect with a conduit so that warm air may be passed via the filter 600 of the blower unit to, for example, a warming blanket via a conduit (such as the conduit generally described herein). On insertion of the filter 600 into a filter port of the blower unit, the microchip 602 on the filter 600 is brought into contact with the microchip sensor 604 on the body of the blower unit 606. As best illustrated in Figure 7, the microchip sensor 604 includes three ports 612 which come into contact with three reciprocal ports (not shown) on the microchip 602 to establish three channels between the microchip 602 and the microchip sensor 604. The first channel provides energy to the microchip 602; the second channel allows for data transmission to and from the microchip 602, data may be written to or transferred from the microchip 602; and a third channel verifies contact between the microchip 602 and the microchip sensor 604 to close a circuit and provide blower functionality, thus whilst the microchip 602 and microchip sensor 604 are in contact the blower is able to operate, however in the absence of this contact the blower is inoperable. The microchip 602 includes a unique filter ID which identifies the filter 600 to the control unit. During operation, the control unit monitors the operation of the filter 600, such as measuring a variable associated with the filter 600 and records that information against the filter's unique filter ID. Such information may include pressure drop across the filter, total lifetime operation, and/or current duration of operation. The skilled addressee will appreciate that other variables may be measured and recorded such as additional operational parameters, furthermore, the skilled addressee will appreciate that multiple measured variables may be recorded. The information may be stored by the control unit, written to the microchip 602, or both. The advantage of storing the information of the microchip 602 is that if the blower unit is connected with a different control unit, then the control unit is able to download the operational history of the filter 600 from the microchip 602. Similarly, if the filter 600 is removed from one blower unit and reinserted into another blower unit, the microchip 602 can identify the filter 600 and provide details of that filters operational history to the control unit. In such instances where the different blower units have filters 600 with different microchips 602, the control unit or the microchips 602 themselves can be configured to maintain a log that stores the measured variable of each specific filter. The control unit is configured to measure a variable, such as those discussed above, that is associated with filter 600 and to provide an output based on that variable. In one example, the measured variable is the total lifetime usage of the filter 600. In this example, the control unit is programmed to compare the total lifetime usage of the filter 600 against a maximum lifetime usage. If the total lifetime usage is less than the maximum lifetime usage, then the control unit permits the filter to be used. However, if the total lifetime usage is exceeds the maximum lifetime usage, then the control unit provides a warning to a user that the filter needs to be replaced with a new filter. The warning may be audial, visual, or a combination of both. The visual warning may be a message on a display screen associated with the control unit. The control unit may be programmed to prevent operation of the filter once a maximum number of hours have been reached. There may be a series of cascading alarms that alert the user to replace the filter. For example, there may be a first warning when the total lifetime usage reaches a first threshold value, a second warning when the filter is about to reach the total lifetime hours, and then a third warning as the total lifetime hours reaches the total lifetime usage. The number of alarms and the specific set points for those alarms may be set by a user, part of the logic of the control unit, or part of the logic of the microchip 602 associated with the filter 600. In an embodiment a filter has a service lifetime of about 1000 hours. Once filter usage is approaching 1000 hours, the control unit may issue a warning to indicate that the end of the service lifetime of the filter is approaching. The control unit may issue multiple warnings, for example a first visual warning such as an onscreen message or a warning light, followed by an audial warning. Furthermore, the control unit may issue a first alert indicating that service lifetime has passed a first value, and a second alert indicating that service lifetime has passed a second value that is greater than the first value. As above, the warnings may be visual, audial, or both. Once the maximum service lifetime has been reached, the control unit may be configured to cease the blower from continued operation. In this case, removing and replacing the filter with a new filter. In such cases, the microchip sensor 604 will identify that a new filter has been inserted by reading the unique identifier on the microchip 602. Figures 9 provides a schematic illustration of the filter 900, and the microchip 902 located on an underside of the filter 900. As can be seen in Figure 10 the microchip 902 is a printed circuit board (PCB) chip that includes three ports 914 for communication with corresponding ports 912 on the microchip sensor 904 as shown in Figures 1 1 and 12. Figure 1 1 provides an illustration of a filter 900 in a partially removed/inserted state. As can be seen, complete insertion of the filter 900 will cause the bottom of the filter 900 to come into contact with the microchip sensor 904 that is located on the body of the blower unit 906. Figure 12 shows the microchip sensor 904 in more detail, again illustrating the three ports 912 that contact reciprocal ports 914 on the microchip. Figure 13, 14, and 15 provide an illustration of one embodiment of a control unit for use, such as with the warming blanket and blower units discussed above. Figure 13 shows a front view of the control unit 1300 having a display panel 1302. The display panel 1302 provides information to a user regarding the operating settings and conditions of the warming blanket system. For example, the display panel 1302 can indicate the temperature of the air supplied from the blower unit to the warming blanket, the placement of the warming blanket over the patient, the maximum set point temperature, status of the filter, run time of the blower etc. The display panel 1302 may be a touch screen. In various embodiments, the display panel 1302 includes icons or buttons that can be actuated by a user touching the screen. The icons or buttons may be used to switch the blower on or off, and/or be used to control process parameters such as increasing or decreasing the air temperature or flow rate, fan speed, be used to activate pre-programmed operations such as a turbo boost function, be used to display information recorded by the control unit, and/or provide feedback to a user. Figure 14 illustrates a side view of the control unit 1300. Figure 15 illustrates a rear view of the control unit 1300.
