SYNTHESIS EXAMPLES
Example 1: Synthesis of Compound 28
2-methyl-3-(octan-2-yloxy)aniline (240 mg, 1.03 mmol), triethylamine (110 mg, 1.09 mmol) and dichloromethane (10 mL) were added to a flask, stirred at room temperature, then the solution of 3-(difluoromethyl)-5-fluoro-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonyl chloride (210 mg, 0.99 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) was added dropwise. After being stirred for 3 hours at room temperature, water (30 mL) was added. The organic layer was successively washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated by rotary evaporator. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (Fluent: ethyl acetate/petroleum ether=1/2) to give the compound 28 (250 mg) in 60.8% yield.
