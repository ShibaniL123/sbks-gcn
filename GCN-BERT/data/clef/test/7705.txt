Beverage Dispensing Machine The present invention relates to a machine suitable for domestic use for dispensing beverages and certain foods and, more specifically, to a dispenser, which rapidly prepares a drinkable product from the contents of a cartridge that is inserted into the machine, containing solid or other difficult-to-dissolve ingredients. It is known how to make cold beverages such as juices and fruit smoothies from fresh ingredients by using a juicer or blender. However, such machines require a substantial amount of cleaning after each use since the product comes into contact with components of the machine. Moreover fresh ingredients have a very limited shelf life. Numerous machines are known for brewing coffee and tea by passing hot water through a cartridge containing coffee grounds or other substances from which a beverage can be brewed. These are easier to maintain, but are limited in the ingredients that can be used. The TASSIMO (Registered Trade Mark) machine is described in a multitude of patent documents including, for example, US 7097074 Β published 29 August 2006. This system uses an essentially rigid cartridge, which has a foil seal that can be pierced in order to create an inlet that allows water to pass along a convoluted path through the beverage ingredients contained within the cartridge. The beverage can then be directly discharged into a receptacle. Machines are also known for preparing beverages using flexible cartridges. One such system which has been on the market since 1984 is supplied under the FLA VIA (Registered Trade Mark) brand, and uses a flexible cartridge containing beverage ingredients such tea or coffee and a paper filter. The cartridge has a plastic nozzle, which allows it to be clipped into a machine that passes water through the cartridge and dispenses a drink directly from an outlet of the cartridge. This type of passive system would not be suitable for freeze-dried ingredients, however, as the mere addition of water would tend to create an insoluble cement. Nevertheless this machine is considered to be the closest prior art since it uses a method of producing a beverage from dry ingredients contained within a sealed flexible cartridge, comprising breaking the seal to introduce a charge of water. Another multi-drink beverage vending machine is manufactured by BEVYZ (Trade Mark). This machine uses capsules in the form of rigid cartridges sealed with foil lids that contain liquid ingredients like juice concentrates or flavor mixtures. The dispensing machine described, for example, in ΕΡ2430955 MDS Global Holding Ltd is designed to compress a base of the capsule in order to eject the contents into a container at the same time as a charge of water.. These machines are limited however to the use of relatively easy-to-dissolve ingredients which are mixed with the water in the container. It would be useful to provide a machine that could reconstitute solid freeze-dried ingredients rapidly and conveniently on demand. Freeze-drying uniquely preserves the flavours and vitamin content of fresh ingredients. After rehydration, a freeze-dried orange juice can have more than 200% greater vitamin C content than a typical retail juice for example. Freeze-drying reduces the volume and weight of a juice or smoothie beverage by 5 to 9 times, facilitating storage and transport for the consumer and across the supply chain. If the freeze-dried ingredients are vacuum packed they can be stored at ambient temperature for several years. The use of mixtures of freeze-dried ingredients of different flavours offers the potential for a wide variety of product offerings. While freeze -dried coffee can be successfully dissolved in boiling water, in most cases rehydration is not as straightforward, especially if a cold beverage is required. Summary of the Invention The present invention aims to overcome the technical problems of rehydrating and/or bringing back the dry product into solution, preferably using chilled water within a timescale suitable for ondemand use at home of, say, 30 to 60 seconds. The invention recognises that these problems can be best overcome by employing a method, which acts on the exterior of a cartridge in order to agitate the contents and thereby dissolve the majority of the contents. The purpose of the external action is to rehydrate and homogenise freeze-dried ingredients. This contrasts with the approach taken in the prior art brewing machines, which typically press water slowly through beverage ingredients with the object of bringing into solution a relatively small proportion of the flavour components within the ingredient. Brief Description of the Drawings In order that the invention may be well understood, several embodiments thereof will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which: Figure 1 is a perspective view of a household machine for preparing and dispensing beverages made from freeze-dried ingredients contained in a flexible cartridge; Figure 2 is a schematic overview of the components of the machine; Figure 3 is a front plan view of a first embodiment of the invention using double sided linear motion to agitate the ingredients in the cartridge; Figure 4 is a side view of the machine of Figure 3; Figure 5 is a side view of a second embodiment of the invention in which the cartridge is acted on on only one side; Figure 6 is a side view of a third embodiment of the invention similar to Figure 5 using an isolating sheet; Figure 7 is a front plan view of a fourth embodiment which uses a rotary motion; Figure 8 is a side view of a fifth embodiment which uses a paddle mixer; Figure 9 is a side view of a sixth embodiment which uses a piston kneading system; and Figure 10 is a side view of a seventh embodiment which uses a pneumatic or hydraulic kneading system. A first embodiment of a household machine 2 for dispensing beverages will now be described by reference to Figures 1 to 4. The term beverage is used for the product of the machine, but it will be appreciated that other products could be created, including soups, sauces, baby food and the like. The beverage dispenser machine 2 has a housing with a water supply connection 4. Ideally the machine is connected to a permanent water source, but it may also contain a water reservoir to be filled up by the user when required as with a typical household coffee filtering machine. The housing defines a receptacle 10 for receiving a flexible cartridge or pouch 12. A control panel 6 is provided on the housing with switches to start and stop a beverage preparation cycle. The panel 6 may also allow the user to select different programmes. In the machine illustrated in Figure 1, a door or cover over the cartridge receptacle has been removed. It will be appreciated that a suitable closure such as a hinged or roll-up door could be used to cover the receptacle in use and allow access for loading and unloading cartridges. The door may be transparent to allow printing on a cartridge indicating the type of beverage being produced to be visible to the user. A schematic layout of the machine is shown in Figure 2. The control panel 6 provides the user with access to a microcontroller 100, that is programmable in order to control the entire operation of the machine. A screen 102 for display purposes can also be provided and will be connected to the control panel and microcontroller. When the screen is a touchscreen it may replace the functionality of the control panel. A wireless interface 104 can also be provided for remote control or to feed data back to other equipment or service providers. As shown in Figure 2, the water supply system may include reservoirs 106 for both hot and cold water. Each reservoir is connected via a respective water filter 108 to a respective pump 110 controlled by the microcontroller 100. Non-retum valves 112 are provided in the outlet pipes that feed into the cartridge 12. A system 120 for injecting small amounts of liquid ingredients into the feed water stream under microcontroller control is also provided. Here, three syringe pump reservoirs 124, each with a respective motorised and microcontroller controlled pump mechanism 126 are illustrated. However, it will be appreciated that more or fewer reservoirs may be provided and other mechanisms may be used to inject these ingredients into the supply of water. These liquid ingredients may include flavours, acid, sweetener, chemical fizzing agents or other functional ingredients suitable to customise the beverage. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the water supply for the machine is connected to a first coupling 14 for connecting to an inlet section 16 of the cartridge to a water source. There is a second outlet coupling 18 for connecting an outlet section 20 of the cartridge to the machine outlet 8 (preferably the cartridge outlet itself to avoid the need for additional machine components that require cleaning) that dispenses a beverage product into a container 15. A kneading system is provided to act on the cartridge within the receptacle. The kneading system is activated after water has been allowed to enter the cartridge and mechanically acts on the exterior of the pouch to move the contents of the pouch around, facilitating rehydration and/or the dissolution of the contained product in the water. The outlet coupling is provided to seal or release the outlet section of the cartridge in order to prevent dispensing of the product during the operation of the kneading system. After a predetermined time an outlet valve 24 can be opened to dispense the beverage from the cartridge outlet 20 and outlet 8 into the container 15. The machine can use various different kneading systems and the embodiments show some examples of different approaches. The Cartridge The cartridge 12 is designed to hold sufficient product to make a single serving of a beverage. In the embodiment described, this is a smoothie and the ingredients are freeze-dried fruit products and/or freeze-dried juice powder. However it will be appreciated that the cartridge could contain ingredients for other products such as soup, baby food or sauce. The cartridge is an expandable soft pouch and has a flexible envelope 26 of material such as a food-safe plastic material that can be heat-sealed. A suitable material is polyethylene (PE) lined polyamide (nylon). The nylon gives the cartridge rigidity and makes it less pervious to water and air. Such materials are temperature stable for welding and are commercially available for food packaging. Corrugated weldable LDPE sheet can also be used to make such a cartridge. The cartridge has inlet, main compartment 28 and outlet sections. The main compartment has major flat surfaces on each side face, which are preferably joined together by gusseted panels along their longitudinal edges so that the compartment can expand when filled with a charge of water. The inlet section 16 contains a one-way valve 30 to prevent water or product being pushed back into the machine during a kneading phase of its operation. This valve 30 can be created as a duck bill structure moulded into the cartridge neck where an upper edge of the major surface joins the inlet section. A sponge filter 32 is located inside the main compartment close to the outlet section. The inlet and outlet sections 16, 20 are narrower than the main compartment. A further sealed compartment 34 is created downstream of the filter to house additional ingredients. These are ingredients which are difficult to dissolve or which are insoluble and which may clog the exit filter 32 of the main ingredient compartment or for other reasons should not be subjected to kneading. This may include ingredients for: · Providing mouth feel (pulp, seeds, gums, fruit pieces etc.) • Ingredient to provide fizz, where gas production during kneading would be undesirable. Typical dimensions of the cartridge are: Main compartment 120mm χ 70mm χ 20mm (with gussets extended) for a 300ml serving size. The overall length including inlet and outlet sections is 180mm. The comers of the main compartment are rounded, as are the shoulders where the inlet and outlet sections merge with the main compartment. This prevents ingredients lodging in these places. The inlet and outlet sections 16, 20 provide airtight seals 36 for the cartridge during storage. The seals are designed to prevent ingress of moisture, air etc. and egress of ingredients during storage and handling. When the inlet section is coupled to the machine, this seal at the inlet is punctured during the cartridge loading process. The outlet seal is preferably designed such that it opens during the kneading process without the need for a special mechanism. For example it may be a dissolvable seal, or a seal that can be broken open by pressure during the kneading process. The inlet coupling 14 is used to clamp the inlet section of the cartridge in place and may provide the mechanism for puncturing the seal. This coupling has several additional functions. It holds a cartridge in place, it also allows water to enter the cartridge during an initial filling phase of the beverage preparation operation, as well as resealing the cartridge during the needing phase of the operation in order to prevent product from being pushed back into the machine. This function of the inlet coupling may be in addition to or replace the one-way valve 30, which is preferably provided inside the cartridge. The coupling can be implemented as a bar that is pressed by motorised mechanism across the cartridge inlet. It will be appreciated that other design approaches may be adopted that allow these functions to be performed. The outlet coupling 18 is similar to the inlet coupling 14 in this embodiment, and provides a bar, which is latched over the outlet section of the cartridge. The bar can be motorised to provide sealing pressure on the outlet section to close it off during the kneading phase of the beverage preparation operation. When the kneading phase is complete, the motor can be controlled to release sealing pressure and allow the product to exit the cartridge through the outlet section 20 into a container 15. The outlet coupling can provide the outlet valve 24 or be in addition to a separate valve 24 provided in the cartridge. The cartridge also contains a filter 32 near its exit, which allows only hydrated product to pass. The structure, material, size and shape of the filter is dependent on the product to be processed, but typically it is a highly porous, sponge-like material. A filter with a volume of typically 10-20 ml and composed of highly porous, open-pored polyurethane foam has been found to be effective. PE nets may also be used. The Kneading System The rehydration of the freeze-dried ingredients within the cartridge without having machine components contact the contents of the cartridge presents several technical problems, especially when producing cold beverages. Many fruit or vegetable based solid ingredients tend to cake, impeding effective rehydration or leading to inhomogeneous product, or they may leave sticky residue clogging filters or the product outlet. The kneading of a soft cartridge has been found to resolve these technical problems effectively. The objective of the kneading system is to move the dry ingredients around inside the cartridge and bring them into close contact with a charge of water in order to mix and homogenise the contents of the cartridge. In the embodiment of Figures 2 and 3, the kneading system comprises a pair of rollers 40 which operate on opposite major surfaces of the exterior of the cartridge. These rollers are mounted on a motorised sledge 42 that is moved under pressure along the longitudinal axis of the cartridge. The rollers are mounted using a spring-loaded mechanism that maintains roller pressure on the cartridge in the direction perpendicular to the cartridge surface. This pressure can be varied during operation of the kneading system and the rollers can also be lifted clear from the cartridge surface, by operation of a separate motorised drive mechanism to facilitate loading of the cartridge. The rollers are preferably segmented rubber rollers so that each segment 44 can roll freely independently of the other segments. The rollers may have a smooth, ridged, knobbly or other textured surface. The sledge 42 is preferably driven so that it can complete one full up and down movement across the surface of the main section of the cartridge approximately once every one to two seconds. The effect of the motion of the sledge up and down over the main compartment is to periodically and sequentially compress and release regions of the main compartment between the rollers causing the contents of the cartridge to be forced to move and in the compressed region for ingredients to be brought into intimate contact with water to aid dissolution. Ridges or other formations on an internal surface of the main compartment walls can improve mixing. The filter 32 is designed and positioned preferably such that the kneading rollers 40 pass over it, aiding the periodic unclogging of the filter, as well as the intimate mixing of water and ingredients. It will be appreciated that the design engineer has many options for implementing this mechanism. Some of these are illustrated in the other embodiments. In all of them, the purpose is to ensure that the cartridge is manipulated in such a manner as to bring the water and solid contents into intimate contact with one another under varying pressure conditions so as to encourage full rehydration and/or dissolution of the various ingredients in a short time. The mechanism mimics a manual kneading operation. The kneading process is preferably carried out with multiple cycles of adding water, kneading and dispensing to allow a modestly sized cartridge to dispense an acceptable beverage volume. Alternative Kneading Systems While the arrangement of kneading rollers 40 on both sides of the ingredient cartridge as shown in Figures 2 and 3 facilitates the mixing of water and ingredients and reduces the likelihood of ingredients sticking to the cartridge walls, the mechanism is relatively complex and can impede user access for loading and unloading of the cartridge. A single-sided configuration as shown in Figure 5 that uses only one kneading roller and a fixed stage 50 or counter plate on the other side of the cartridge for the roller to press against mitigates some of these issues. The rest position of the roller 40 for loading and removal of the cartridge is shown at 46 in Figure 5. In the Figure the stage 50 is shown as having a flat surface, however a ridged or corrugated surface can be provided as this will facilitate the kneading action and prevent ingredients sticking to an adjacent side of the cartridge wall. Figure 6 shows an arrangement in which the cartridge is mounted with a rubber curtain 60 interposed between the roller 40 and the wall of the cartridge. The curtain 60 is made of flexible rubber sheeting. During operation of the machine there is a risk that a cartridge may burst or leak and this will cause contamination of the kneading system. Since the kneading system is difficult to clean, the use of the curtain 60 improves hygiene and protects the mechanism. If the kneading mechanism, rollers and rubber sheet are located in the back of the machine, the counter plate needs to be located between the user and the cartridge, and can for example take the form of a door for the receptacle 10. Figure 7 shows another system in which the roller is mounted centrally at the rear of the receptacle so that it can rotate or oscillate about an axial mounting 62 perpendicular to the main surface of the cartridge. For this design it is preferable that a central compartment of the cartridge be square or circular rather than rectangular so that the rotating roller covers the entire surface of the cartridge including the filter 32 during its motion. Alternatively, several rollers could be provided to act on different regions of the cartridge. The kneading roller 40 pivots continuously around the centre of the cartridge's main compartment. To facilitate this movement the roller is segmented, and each segment 44 can rotate around the axis of the roller independently to allow a central segment to rotate slower than the outer ones. For this embodiment the cartridge may be modified by the presence of one or more perforated flexible walls 64 dividing the main ingredient compartment into individual chambers. Without such walls, depending on the consistency of the product, the roller may simply move the product in a circular motion without achieving proper mixing. With the walls present, the roller forces the product through the holes in the dividing walls, preventing the formation of large ingredient clusters and significantly improving mixing efficiency. Instead of perforated sheet walls, nets or fabrics in one or more layers may be used. A further variation of the kneading system is shown in Figure 8, which is also shown being used with a cartridge having a flexible, perforated internal wall 64. In this embodiment, the rear of the cartridge-containing receptacle contains a lever 80, which is connected to an eccentric motor drive mechanism 82. The lever supports a pivot point 84 for a kneading paddle 86. Respective ends of the lever support corresponding ends of the paddle 86 with an intervening spring-loaded system 88. This spring system provides flexibility especially during the early stages of mixing when part of the cartridge contents may be solid or highly viscous and would otherwise block the paddle movement. The oscillating movement of the lever is translated into a rocking or seesaw movement of the paddle to alternately compress and release opposite ends of the main compartment causing the contents to be pushed vigorously up and down within the cartridge. For the cartridge dimensions shown in Figure 1, the paddles would move at a frequency of about 1 cps to 10 cps to provide effective mixing. The other side of the cartridge is supported by a stage 50 as in the previous embodiments. This may be a door of the receptacle. It would also be possible to design a system where paddles operated on both sides of the cartridge. Although an up and down kneading movement has been illustrated, it will be appreciated that side-to-side kneading could also be arranged. A curtain (not shown) may be interposed between the paddle and the cartridge in order to allow the drive mechanism to remain isolated from any leakage from the cartridge and facilitate cleaning of the receptacle. Other parts of the machine are as described in the previous embodiments. Figure 9 shows a kneading system in which upper and lower kneading paddles 130 operate out of phase in order to press on the surface of the main surface of the cartridge like reciprocating pistons. Each paddle has a respective cam drive 132, which drives it back and forth rapidly at, for example, 1 to 20 cps. Other features of this embodiment are as previously described. Although two paddles have been shown, it may be desirable to provide more arranged in an array adjacent the main surface. Other paddles may be spring-loaded but not driven. If an array of paddles is used, the smaller paddle surface allows the volume within the cartridge to be preserved for the water and ingredients when the surface is being depressed by only one paddle at a time. The paddles may also be operated such that they all press down simultaneously on the cartridge to aid complete ejection of product from the cartridge. In the embodiment of Figure 10, the paddles are replaced by a pneumatic or hydraulic system in which bellows 140 are inflated and deflated by a pump (not shown). The bellows may be rubber bags or suitably shaped flexible plastics components. Rate of inflation and deflation at 1 to 10 cps is desirable. Other ways of acting on the exterior of the cartridge to rehydrate and homogenise the ingredients can also be used within the scope of the invention. Systems which induce internal vibration and agitation by external action may also be considered. The objective is not to move the entire product charge along the cartridge but to create smaller scale agitation or stirring of the water that is in contact with undissolved ingredients. An agitator drive using a drive coil similar to that used in many loudspeakers to provide the agitation could be considered as well as a larger scale mechanical systems already illustrated. Ultrasound could also be employed. The use of ultrasound for mixing, emulsifying and hydrating liquids and solids is a well-known industrial process. An ultrasound source such as a piezo-electric source with impedance matching horn could be employed. It will be necessary to provide acoustic contact between the impedance matching horn and the product in the cartridge. This could be provided by a pad of soft incompressible gel or silicone pads, which make contact with the external surface of the cartridge. Alternatively, water diverted from the water inlet could be employed to provide the acoustic contact. It will be appreciated that aspects of each embodiment described may be combined in different ways. Cartridge Contents The ingredients 70 for the beverage are contained in the cartridge 12, preferably in powder or granule form. The solid ingredients can consist of a combination of: • Freeze- or spray-dried fruit or vegetable juice • Freeze dried whole-fruit or vegetable (for smoothies, purees etc.) • Sugar or sugar/acid beverage base • Fruit or vegetable pulp, starch, nuts, grains or seeds or similar to provide mouth feel • Minor ingredients such as sweeteners, flavours, spices, preservatives, colouring, fizz generating chemicals, colour etc. • Desiccated ingredients and nutrients such as vitamins, proteins, minerals and the like from synthetic or natural sources (e.g. soya, spirulina etc.) • Burstable or soluble capsules for liquid minor ingredients (such as liquid flavors, sweeteners) • Desiccants and other process aides that do not end up in the final beverage Although mainly intended for use with solid ingredients in powder or granule format, cartridges may contain liquid ingredients like juice or beverage concentrates, plant components (such as teas), meat or animal products (soup, sauces). The total ingredient volume is such that typically > 50% or more of the extended volume of the cartridge is left empty for the addition of a water charge and to provide volume for the kneading process. In this embodiment cartridges contain typically 50g of fruit and juice solids in a cartridge of 170ml net volume when its gusseted side panels are fully extended. The freeze-dried ingredients are vacuum packed in the cartridge to provide an extended ambient shelf life of several years. Although a cartridge with one main compartment has been disclosed, if more complex products are required, the main compartment could be divided into two, either side-by-side or overlaying each other. The subsidiary compartment could then contain a tuning ingredient like pulp that could be added according to taste. Each compartment would require a separate water inlet, and water flow would be controlled by the controller. In order to maximise the product range available from a machine using this method, cartridges can also be supplied which contain ingredients such as tea which would not ordinarily require such processing. In such cases, the machine can be programmed not to apply the external action to the cartridge. Operation of the Machine An operating cycle of the machine includes a cartridge installation phase, a water inlet phase in which a charge of water is fed into the cartridge, a kneading phase to rehydrate and mix the product with water, and a dispensing phase. In the installation phase the cartridge with the necessary ingredients for the chosen beverage is placed by the user in the receptacle. The cartridge is engaged with the couplings 14 and 18 that hold its inlet and outlet sections. The user can then use the control panel 6 to select an appropriate time and or mode of operation for the machine or instructions can be automatically read by the machine from the cartridge. The required time and/or programme can be indicated on the cartridge depending on the ingredients. In some cases longer or shorter operation times may be required. For other beverages the machine may be programmed to charge the cartridge with water in stages. Once the door of the receptacle is closed the operating cycle can commence with the piercing of the inlet seal and charging with water from the water supply. With water in the cartridge and nonreturn valve 30 with the assistance of the inlet coupling holding the inlet section sealed, the kneading phase can begin. There may be multiple kneading phases and additional water charges if prescribed by the programme. Once at least a first kneading phase is complete, the outlet valve 24 is operated to break the outlet seal (if it has not been opened by pressure during the kneading phase) and allow the beverage to be dispensed via the compartment 34 into a container. The additional ingredients in compartment 34 are added to the beverage in this dispensing phase. In order to ensure that the cartridge is completely emptied, air can be injected under pressure into the main compartment to facilitate the ejection of the product at the end of the dispense cycle. Once the cycle is complete the used cartridge can be removed from the receptacle and discarded. Since the beverage has not passed through any part of the machine itself the cleaning requirement is minimal. Ideally the kneading system is separated from the receptacle by the flexible curtain 60 and in rare cases where a cartridge seam may have burst, contamination will be restricted to the curtain which can be readily wiped clean. 1.
