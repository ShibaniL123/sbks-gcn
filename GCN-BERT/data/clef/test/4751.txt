CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No. 13/666,538, filed on Nov. 1, 2012, now allowed, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/554,625, filed on Nov. 2, 2011; the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel compounds having neprilysin-inhibition activity. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, processes and intermediates for preparing such compounds and methods of using such compounds to treat diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and renal disease. 2. State of the Art Neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase, EC 3.4.24.11) (NEP), is an endothelial membrane bound Zn2+ metallopeptidase found in many organs and tissues, including the brain, kidneys, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, heart, and the peripheral vasculature. NEP degrades and inactivates a number of endogenous peptides, such as enkephalins, circulating bradykinin, angiotensin peptides, and natriuretic peptides, the latter of which have several effects including, for example, vasodilation and natriuresis/diuresis, as well as inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy and ventricular fibrosis. Thus, NEP plays an important role in blood pressure homeostasis and cardiovascular health. NEP inhibitors, such as thiorphan, candoxatril, and candoxatrilat, have been studied as potential therapeutics. Compounds that inhibit both NEP and angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) are also known, and include omapatrilat, gempatrilat, and sampatrilat. Referred to as vasopeptidase inhibitors, this latter class of compounds is described in Robl et al. (1999) Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 9(12): 1665-1677. Ksander et al. (1995) J. Med. Chem. 38:1689-1700 describes dicarboxylic acid dipeptide NEP inhibitors of the formula: Compound R IC50 (nM) 21g —C(O)—CH2—COOH 92 21a (R, S) —C(O)—(CH2)2—COOH 5 21b (S, R) —C(O)—(CH2)2—COOH 190 21c (R, R) —C(O)—(CH2)2—COOH 700 21d (S, S) —C(O)—(CH2)2—COOH 27 21e —C(O)—(CH2)3—COOH 90 21f —C(O)—(CH2)4—COOH 324 Compound 21a, which has a succinic acid substituent, is the most active compound, with an IC50 of 5 nM. The authors observed that “the succinic acid in the P2′ site appears to be optimal since extension of the carboxylic acid chain by one (21e) and two (21f) methylene units decreased activity 18- and 65-fold.” The authors further noted that “decreasing the chain length by one methylene (21g) also showed an 18-fold decrease in activity.” (page 1692, 2nd column). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides novel compounds that have been found to possess neprilysin (NEP) enzyme inhibition activity. Accordingly, compounds of the invention are expected to be useful and advantageous as therapeutic agents for treating conditions such as hypertension and heart failure.

When formulated separately, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be included with the additional agent(s). Thus, yet another aspect of the invention relates to a combination of pharmaceutical compositions, the combination comprising: a first pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention and a first pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; and a second pharmaceutical composition comprising a second therapeutic agent and a second pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In another aspect, the invention relates to a kit containing such pharmaceutical compositions, for example where the first and second pharmaceutical compositions are separate pharmaceutical compositions. Compounds of the invention possess NEP enzyme inhibition activity, and are therefore expected to be useful as therapeutic agents for treating patients suffering from a disease or disorder that is treated by inhibiting the NEP enzyme or by increasing the levels of its peptide substrates. Thus, one aspect of the invention relates to a method of treating patients suffering from a disease or disorder that is treated by inhibiting the NEP enzyme, comprising administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Another aspect of the invention relates to a method of treating hypertension, heart failure, or renal disease, comprising administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Still another aspect of the invention relates to a method for inhibiting a NEP enzyme in a mammal comprising administering to the mammal, a NEP enzyme-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention. Since compounds of the invention possess NEP inhibition activity, they are also useful as research tools. Accordingly, one aspect of the invention relates to a method of using a compound of the invention as a research tool, the method comprising conducting a biological assay using a compound of the invention. Compounds of the invention can also be used to evaluate new chemical compounds. Thus another aspect of the invention relates to a method of evaluating a test compound in a biological assay, comprising: (a) conducting a biological assay with a test compound to provide a first assay value; (b) conducting the biological assay with a compound of the invention to provide a second assay value; wherein step (a) is conducted either before, after or concurrently with step (b); and (c) comparing the first assay value from step (a) with the second assay value from step (b). Exemplary biological assays include a NEP enzyme inhibition assay. Still another aspect of the invention relates to a method of studying a biological system or sample comprising a NEP enzyme, the method comprising: (a) contacting the biological system or sample with a compound of the invention; and (b) determining the effects caused by the compound on the biological system or sample. Yet another aspect of the invention relates to processes and intermediates useful for preparing compounds of the invention. Accordingly, another aspect of the invention relates to a process of preparing compounds of formula I, comprising the step of coupling a compound of formula 1 with a compound of formula 2: to produce a compound of formula I; where P is H or an amino-protecting group selected from t-butoxycarbonyl, trityl, benzyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl, formyl, trimethylsilyl, and t-butyldimethylsilyl; and where the process further comprises deprotecting the compound of formula 1 when P is an amino protecting group; and where R1-R6, a, b, and Z are as defined for formula I. Another aspect of the invention relates to a process of preparing a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula I, comprising contacting a compound of formula I in free acid or base form with a pharmaceutically acceptable base or acid. In other aspects, the invention relates to products prepared by any of the processes described herein, as well as novel intermediates used in such process. In one aspect of the invention novel intermediates have formula 1 or a salt thereof, as defined herein. Yet another aspect of the invention relates to the use of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the manufacture of a medicament, especially for the manufacture of a medicament useful for treating hypertension, heart failure, or renal disease. Another aspect of the invention relates to use of a compound of the invention for inhibiting a NEP enzyme in a mammal. Still another aspect of the invention relates to the use of a compound of the invention as a research tool. Other aspects and embodiments of the invention are disclosed herein.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions When describing the compounds, compositions, methods and processes of the invention, the following terms have the following meanings unless otherwise indicated. Additionally, as used herein, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include the corresponding plural forms unless the context of use clearly dictates otherwise. The terms “comprising”, “including,” and “having” are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. All numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth used herein are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about,” unless otherwise indicated. Accordingly, the numbers set forth herein are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each number should at least be construed in light of the reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. The term “alkyl” means a monovalent saturated hydrocarbon group which may be linear or branched. Unless otherwise defined, such alkyl groups typically contain from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and include, for example, —C1-4alkyl, —C1-5alkyl, —C2-5alkyl, —C1-6alkyl, —C1-8alkyl, and —C1-10alkyl. Representative alkyl groups include, by way of example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, s-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, n-decyl and the like. When a specific number of carbon atoms is intended for a particular term used herein, the number of carbon atoms is shown preceding the term as subscript. For example, the term “—C1-6alkyl” means an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and the term “—C3-7cycloalkyl” means a cycloalkyl group having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, respectively, where the carbon atoms are in any acceptable configuration. The term “alkylene” means a divalent saturated hydrocarbon group that may be linear or branched. Unless otherwise defined, such alkylene groups typically contain from 0 to 10 carbon atoms and include, for example, —C0-1alkylene-, —C0-6alkylene-, —C1-3alkylene-, and —C1-6alkylene-. Representative alkylene groups include, by way of example, methylene, ethane-1,2-diyl (“ethylene”), propane-1,2-diyl, propane-1,3-diyl, butane-1,4-diyl, pentane-1,5-diyl and the like. It is understood that when the alkylene term include zero carbons such as —C0-1alkylene-, such terms are intended to include the absence of carbon atoms, that is, the alkylene group is not present except for a covalent bond attaching the groups separated by the alkylene term. The term “aryl” means a monovalent aromatic hydrocarbon having a single ring (i.e., phenyl) or one or more fused rings. Fused ring systems include those that are fully unsaturated (e.g., naphthalene) as well as those that are partially unsaturated (e.g., 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene). Unless otherwise defined, such aryl groups typically contain from 6 to 10 carbon ring atoms and include, for example, —C6-10aryl. Representative aryl groups include, by way of example, phenyl and naphthalene-1-yl, naphthalene-2-yl, and the like. The term “cycloalkyl” means a monovalent saturated carbocyclic hydrocarbon group. Unless otherwise defined, such cycloalkyl groups typically contain from 3 to 10 carbon atoms and include, for example, —C3-5cycloalkyl, —C3-6cycloalkyl and —C3-7cycloalkyl. Representative cycloalkyl groups include, by way of example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and the like. The term “halo” means fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. The term “heteroaryl” is intended to mean a monovalent unsaturated (aromatic) heterocycle having a single ring or two fused rings. Monovalent unsaturated heterocycles are also commonly referred to as “heteroaryl” groups. Unless otherwise defined, heteroaryl groups typically contain from 5 to 10 total ring atoms, of which 1 to 9 are ring carbon atoms, and 1 to 4 are ring heteroatoms, and include, for example, —C1-9heteroaryl and —C5-9heteroaryl. Representative heteroaryl groups include, by way of example, pyrrole (e.g., 3-pyrrolyl and 2H-pyrrol-3-yl), imidazole (e.g., 2-imidazolyl), furan (e.g., 2-furyl and 3-furyl), thiophene (e.g., 2-thienyl), triazole (e.g., 1,2,3-triazolyl and 1,2,4-triazolyl), pyrazole (e.g., 1H-pyrazol-3-yl), oxazole (e.g., 2-oxazolyl), isoxazole (e.g., 3-isoxazolyl), thiazole (e.g., 2-thiazolyl and 4-thiazolyl), and isothiazole (e.g., 3-isothiazolyl), pyridine (e.g., 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, and 4-pyridyl), pyridylimidazole, pyridyltriazole, pyrazine, pyridazine (e.g., 3-pyridazinyl), pyrimidine (e.g., 2-pyrimidinyl), tetrazole, triazine (e.g., 1,3,5-triazinyl), indolyle (e.g., 1H-indol-2-yl, 1H-indol-4-yl and 1H-indol-5-yl), benzofuran (e.g., benzofuran-5-yl), benzothiophene (e.g., benzo[b]thien-2-yl and benzo[b]thien-5-yl), benzimidazole, benzoxazole, benzothiazole, benzotriazole, quinoline (e.g., 2-quinolyl), isoquinoline, quinazoline, quinoxaline and the like. The term “optionally substituted” means that group in question may be unsubstituted or it may be substituted one or several times, such as 1 to 3 times, or 1 to 5 times, or 1 to 8 times. For example, an alkyl group that is “optionally substituted” with fluoro atoms may be unsubstituted, or it may contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 fluoro atoms. Similarly, a group that is “optionally substituted” with one or two —C1-6alkyl groups, may be unsubstituted, or it may contain one or two —C1-6alkyl groups. As used herein, the phrase “having the formula” or “having the structure” is not intended to be limiting and is used in the same way that the term “comprising” is commonly used. For example, if one structure is depicted, it is understood that all stereoisomer and tautomer forms are encompassed, unless stated otherwise. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to a material that is not biologically or otherwise unacceptable when used in the invention. For example, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a material that can be incorporated into a composition and administered to a patient without causing unacceptable biological effects or interacting in an unacceptable manner with other components of the composition. Such pharmaceutically acceptable materials typically have met the required standards of toxicological and manufacturing testing, and include those materials identified as suitable inactive ingredients by the U.S. Food and Drug administration. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” means a salt prepared from a base or an acid which is acceptable for administration to a patient, such as a mammal (for example, salts having acceptable mammalian safety for a given dosage regime). However, it is understood that the salts covered by the invention are not required to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as salts of intermediate compounds that are not intended for administration to a patient. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases and from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids. In addition, when a compound of formula I contains both a basic moiety, such as an amine, pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety such as a carboxylic acid or tetrazole, zwitterions may be formed and are included within the term “salt” as used herein. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic bases include ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, and zinc salts, and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including substituted amines, cyclic amines, naturally-occurring amines and the like, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperadine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acids include salts of boric, carbonic, hydrohalic (hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydrofluoric or hydroiodic), nitric, phosphoric, sulfamic and sulfuric acids. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids include salts of aliphatic hydroxyl acids (for example, citric, gluconic, glycolic, lactic, lactobionic, malic, and tartaric acids), aliphatic monocarboxylic acids (for example, acetic, butyric, formic, propionic and trifluoroacetic acids), amino acids (for example, aspartic and glutamic acids), aromatic carboxylic acids (for example, benzoic, p-chlorobenzoic, diphenylacetic, gentisic, hippuric, and triphenylacetic acids), aromatic hydroxyl acids (for example, o-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 1-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic and 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acids), ascorbic, dicarboxylic acids (for example, fumaric, maleic, oxalic and succinic acids), glucoronic, mandelic, mucic, nicotinic, orotic, pamoic, pantothenic, sulfonic acids (for example, benzenesulfonic, camphosulfonic, edisylic, ethanesulfonic, isethionic, methanesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic, naphthalene-2,6-disulfonic and p-toluenesulfonic acids), xinafoic acid, and the like. As used herein, the term “prodrug” is generally intended to mean an inactive precursor of a drug that is converted into its active form in the body under physiological conditions, for example, by normal metabolic processes. Such compounds may not possess pharmacological activity at NEP, but may be administered orally or parenterally and thereafter metabolized in the body to form compounds that are pharmacologically active at NEP. When orally administered, such compounds may also provide a better fraction absorbed (i.e., better pK properties) for renal delivery, as compared to oral administration of the active form. Exemplary prodrugs include esters such as C1-6alkylesters and aryl-C1-6alkylesters. In one embodiment, the active compound has a free carboxyl and the prodrug is an ester derivative thereof, i.e., the prodrug is an ester such as —C(O)OCH2CH3. Such ester prodrugs are then converted by solvolysis or under physiological conditions to be the free carboxyl compound. The term “prodrug” is also intended to include a less active precursor of a drug that is converted into a more active form in the body. For example, certain prodrugs may possess pharmacological activity at NEP, but not necessarily at the desired level; such compounds are converted in the body into a form having the desired level of activity. The term is also intended to include certain protected derivatives of compounds of formula I that may be made prior to a final deprotection stage. Thus, all protected derivatives and prodrugs of compounds formula I are included within the scope of the invention. The term “therapeutically effective amount” means an amount sufficient to effect treatment when administered to a patient in need thereof, that is, the amount of drug needed to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. For example, a therapeutically effective amount for treating hypertension is an amount of compound needed to, for example, reduce, suppress, eliminate, or prevent the symptoms of hypertension, or to treat the underlying cause of hypertension. In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount is that amount of drug needed to reduce blood pressure or the amount of drug needed to maintain normal blood pressure. On the other hand, the term “effective amount” means an amount sufficient to obtain a desired result, which may not necessarily be a therapeutic result. For example, when studying a system comprising a NEP enzyme, an “effective amount” may be the amount needed to inhibit the enzyme. The term “treating” or “treatment” as used herein means the treating or treatment of a disease or medical condition (such as hypertension) in a patient, such as a mammal (particularly a human) that includes one or more of the following: (a) preventing the disease or medical condition from occurring, i.e., preventing the reoccurrence of the disease or medical condition or prophylactic treatment of a patient that is pre-disposed to the disease or medical condition; (b) ameliorating the disease or medical condition, i.e., eliminating or causing regression of the disease or medical condition in a patient; (c) suppressing the disease or medical condition, i.e., slowing or arresting the development of the disease or medical condition in a patient; or (d) alleviating the symptoms of the disease or medical condition in a patient. For example, the term “treating hypertension” would include preventing hypertension from occurring, ameliorating hypertension, suppressing hypertension, and alleviating the symptoms of hypertension (for example, lowering blood pressure). The term “patient” is intended to include those mammals, such as humans, that are in need of treatment or disease prevention or that are presently being treated for disease prevention or treatment of a specific disease or medical condition, as well as test subjects in which compounds of the invention are being evaluated or being used in an assay, for example an animal model. All other terms used herein are intended to have their ordinary meaning as understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to which they pertain. In one aspect, the invention relates to compounds of formula I: or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. As used herein, the term “compound of the invention” includes all compounds encompassed by formula I such as the species embodied in formulas Ia and Ib, as well as the compounds encompassed by formulas IIa-IIk, IIIa-IIIb, and IVa-IVd. In addition, the compounds of the invention may also contain several basic or acidic groups (for example, amino or carboxyl groups) and therefore, such compounds can exist as a free base, free acid, or in various salt forms. All such salt forms are included within the scope of the invention. Furthermore, the compounds of the invention may also exist as prodrugs. Accordingly, those skilled in the art will recognize that reference to a compound herein, for example, reference to a “compound of the invention” or a “compound of formula I” includes a compound of formula I as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs of that compound unless otherwise indicated. Further, the term “or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or prodrug thereof” is intended to include all permutations of salts and prodrugs, such as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a prodrug. Furthermore, solvates of compounds of formula I are included within the scope of this invention. The compounds of formula I may contain one or more chiral centers and therefore, these compounds may be prepared and used in various stereoisomeric forms. Accordingly, the invention also relates to racemic mixtures, pure stereoisomers (e.g., enantiomers and diastereoisomers), stereoisomer-enriched mixtures, and the like unless otherwise indicated. When a chemical structure is depicted herein without any stereochemistry, it is understood that all possible stereoisomers are encompassed by such structure. Thus, for example, the terms “compound of formula I,” “compounds of formula II,” and so forth, are intended to include all possible stereoisomers of the compound. Similarly, when a particular stereoisomer is shown or named herein, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that minor amounts of other stereoisomers may be present in the compositions of the invention unless otherwise indicated, provided that the utility of the composition as a whole is not eliminated by the presence of such other isomers. Individual stereoisomers may be obtained by numerous methods that are well known in the art, including chiral chromatography using a suitable chiral stationary phase or support, or by chemically converting them into diastereoisomers, separating the diastereoisomers by conventional means such as chromatography or recrystallization, then regenerating the original stereoisomer. Additionally, where applicable, all cis-trans or E/Z isomers (geometric isomers), tautomeric forms and topoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are included within the scope of the invention unless otherwise specified. More specifically, compounds of formula I can contain at least two chiral centers when the “Z” moiety is —CH—, and can contain at least one chiral center when the “Z” moiety is —N—. These chiral centers are indicated by the symbols * and ** in the following formulas Ia and Ib: Note however, that there is no * chiral center when R2 is taken together with R3 to form —CH2—O—CH2— or —CH2—CH2—, or R2 and R3 are both —CH3. In one stereoisomer of the compound of formula Ia, both carbon atoms identified by the * and ** symbols have the (R) configuration. In this embodiment, compounds have the (R,R) configuration at the * and ** carbon atoms or are enriched in a stereoisomeric form having the (R,R) configuration at these carbon atoms. In another stereoisomer of the compound of formula Ia, both carbon atoms identified by the * and ** symbols have the (S) configuration. In this embodiment, compounds have the (S,S) configuration at the * and ** carbon atoms or are enriched in a stereoisomeric form having the (S,S) configuration at these carbon atoms. In yet another stereoisomer of the compound of formula Ia, the carbon atom identified by the symbol * has the (S) configuration and the carbon atom identified by the symbol ** has the (R) configuration. In this embodiment, compounds have the (S,R) configuration at the * and ** carbon atoms or are enriched in a stereoisomeric form having the (S,R) configuration at these carbon atoms. In still another stereoisomer of the compound of formula Ia, the carbon atom identified by the symbol * has the (R) configuration and the carbon atom identified by the symbol ** has the (S) configuration. In this embodiment, compounds have the (R,S) configuration at the * and ** carbon atoms or are enriched in a stereoisomeric form having the (R,S) configuration at these carbon atoms. In one stereoisomer of the compound of formula Ib, the carbon atom identified by the * symbol has the (R) configuration. In this embodiment, compounds have the (R) configuration at the * carbon atom or are enriched in a stereoisomeric form having the (R) configuration at this carbon atom.

Thus, in certain aspects, this invention relates to each individual enantiomer or to an enantiomer-enriched mixture of enantiomers comprising predominately one enantiomer or the other enantiomer. In other embodiments, the compounds of the invention are present as racemic mixtures of enantiomers. The compounds of the invention, as well as those compounds used in their synthesis, may also include isotopically-labeled compounds, that is, where one or more atoms have been enriched with atoms having an atomic mass different from the atomic mass predominately found in nature. Examples of isotopes that may be incorporated into the compounds of formula I, for example, include, but are not limited to, 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 35S, 36Cl, and 18F.

In one particular embodiment of these compounds, R2 is —OR21 or —CH2OR21; and R3 is H or —CH3; where R21 is H. In addition, particular compounds of formula I that are of interest include those set forth in the Examples below, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. General Synthetic Procedures Compounds of the invention can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods, the procedures set forth in the Examples, or by using other methods, reagents, and starting materials that are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Although the following procedures may illustrate a particular embodiment of the invention, it is understood that other embodiments of the invention can be similarly prepared using the same or similar methods or by using other methods, reagents and starting materials known to those of ordinary skill in the art. It will also be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (for example, reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. In some instances, reactions were conducted at room temperature and no actual temperature measurement was taken. It is understood that room temperature can be taken to mean a temperature within the range commonly associated with the ambient temperature in a laboratory environment, and will typically be in the range of about 18° C. to about 30° C. In other instances, reactions were conducted at room temperature and the temperature was actually measured and recorded. While optimum reaction conditions will typically vary depending on various reaction parameters such as the particular reactants, solvents and quantities used, those of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine suitable reaction conditions using routine optimization procedures. Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary or desired to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group as well as suitable conditions and reagents for protection and deprotection of such functional groups are well-known in the art. Protecting groups other than those illustrated in the procedures described herein may be used, if desired. For example, numerous protecting groups, and their introduction and removal, are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Fourth Edition, Wiley, New York, 2006, and references cited therein. Carboxy-protecting groups are suitable for preventing undesired reactions at a carboxy group, and examples include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, t-butyl, benzyl (Bn), p-methoxybenzyl (PMB), 9-fluorenylmethyl (Fm), trimethylsilyl (TMS), t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), diphenylmethyl (benzhydryl, DPM) and the like. Amino-protecting groups are suitable for preventing undesired reactions at an amino group, and examples include, but are not limited to, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), trityl (Tr), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), formyl, trimethylsilyl (TMS), t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), and the like. Hydroxyl-protecting groups are suitable for preventing undesired reactions at a hydroxyl group, and examples include, but are not limited to C1-6alkyls, silyl groups including triC1-6alkylsilyl groups, such as trimethylsilyl (TMS), triethylsilyl (TES), and t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS); esters (acyl groups) including C1-6alkanoyl groups, such as formyl, acetyl, and pivaloyl, and aromatic acyl groups such as benzoyl; arylmethyl groups such as benzyl (Bn), p-methoxybenzyl (PMB), 9-fluorenylmethyl (Fm), and diphenylmethyl (benzhydryl, DPM); and the like. Standard deprotection techniques and reagents are used to remove the protecting groups, and may vary depending upon which group is used. For example, sodium or lithium hydroxide is commonly used when the carboxy-protecting group is methyl, an acid such as TFA or HCl is commonly used when the carboxy-protecting group is ethyl or t-butyl, and H2/Pd/C may be used when the carboxy-protecting group is benzyl. A BOC amino-protecting group can be removed using an acidic reagent such as TFA in DCM or HCl in 1,4-dioxane, while a Cbz amino-protecting group can be removed by employing catalytic hydrogenation conditions such as H2 (1 atm) and 10% Pd/C in an alcoholic solvent (“H2/Pd/C”). H2/Pd/C is commonly used when the hydroxyl-protecting group is benzyl, while NaOH is commonly used when the hydroxyl-protecting group is an acyl group. Suitable bases for use in these schemes include, by way of illustration and not limitation, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, triethylamine, pyridine, 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), 4-methylmorpholine, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium t-butoxide, and metal hydrides. Suitable inert diluents or solvents for use in these schemes include, by way of illustration and not limitation, tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetonitrile (MeCN), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), toluene, dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CHCl3), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), 1,4-dioxane, methanol, ethanol, water, and the like. Suitable carboxylic acid/amine coupling reagents include benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)uronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU), (2-(6-chloro-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylaminium hexafluorophosphate) (HCTU), 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide (EDCI), carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), and the like. Coupling reactions are conducted in an inert diluent in the presence of a base such as DIPEA, and are performed under conventional amide bond-forming conditions. All reactions are typically conducted at a temperature within the range of about −78 C to 100° C., for example at room temperature. Reactions may be monitored by use of thin layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and/or LCMS until completion. Reactions may be complete in minutes, or may take hours, typically from 1-2 hours and up to 48 hours. Upon completion, the resulting mixture or reaction product may be further treated in order to obtain the desired product. For example, the resulting mixture or reaction product may be subjected to one or more of the following procedures: concentrating or partitioning (for example, between EtOAc and water or between 5% THF in EtOAc and 1M phosphoric acid); extraction (for example, with EtOAc, CHCl3, DCM, chloroform); washing (for example, with saturated aqueous NaCl, saturated aqueous NaHCO3, Na2CO3 (5%), CHCl3 or 1M NaOH); drying (for example, over MgSO4, over Na2SO4, or in vacuo); filtering; crystallizing (for example, from EtOAc and hexanes); being concentrated (for example, in vacuo); and/or purification (e.g., silica gel chromatography, flash chromatography, preparative HPLC, reverse phase-HPLC, or crystallization). Compounds of formula I, as well as their salts, can be prepared as shown in Scheme I: The process comprises the step of coupling compound 1 with compound 2, where R1-R6, Z, a, and b are as defined for formula I, and P is selected from H and a suitable amino-protecting group, examples of which include t-butoxycarbonyl, trityl, benzyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl, formyl, trimethylsilyl, and t-butyldimethylsilyl. When P is an amino protecting group, the process further comprises deprotecting the compound of formula 1, before or in situ with the coupling step. In instances where R1 is a group such as —OCH3 or —OCH2CH3, the coupling step may be followed by a deprotection step to provide a compound of formula I where R1 is a group such as —OH. Thus, one method of preparing compounds of the invention involves coupling compounds 1 and 2, with an optional deprotection step to form a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Methods of preparing compound 1 are described in the Examples. Compound 2 is generally commercially available or can be prepared using procedures that are known in the art. Certain intermediates described herein are believed to be novel and accordingly, such compounds are provided as further aspects of the invention including, for example, the compounds of formula 1, or a salt thereof: where P is H or a suitable amino-protecting group, examples of which include, t-butoxycarbonyl, trityl, benzyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl, formyl, trimethylsilyl, and t-butyldimethylsilyl; and R1, R2, R3, R5, R6, Z, a and b are as defined for formula I. Further details regarding specific reaction conditions and other procedures for preparing representative compounds of the invention or intermediates thereof are described in the Examples set forth below. Utility Compounds of the invention possess neprilysin (NEP) inhibition activity, that is, the compounds are able to inhibit enzyme-catalytic activity. In another embodiment, the compounds do not exhibit significant inhibitory activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. One measure of the ability of a compound to inhibit NEP activity is the inhibition constant (pKi). The pKi value is the negative logarithm to base 10 of the dissociation constant (Ki), which is typically reported in molar units. Compounds of the invention of particular interest are those having a pKi at NEP greater than or equal to 6.0, particularly those having a pKi greater than or equal to 7.0, and even more particularly those having a pKi greater than or equal to 8.0. In one embodiment, compounds of interest have a pKi in the range of 6.0-6.9; in another embodiment, compounds of interest have a pKi in the range of 7.0-7.9; in yet another embodiment, compounds of interest have a pKi in the range of 8.0-8.9; and in still another embodiment, compounds of interest have a pKi in the range of greater than or equal to 9.0. Such values can be determined by techniques that are well known in the art, as well as in the assays described herein. Another measure of the ability of a compound to inhibit NEP activity is the apparent inhibition constant (IC50), which is the molar concentration of compound that results in half-maximal inhibition of substrate conversion by the NEP enzyme. The pIC50 value is the negative logarithm to base 10 of the IC50. Compounds of the invention that are of particular interest, include those that exhibit a pIC50 for NEP greater than or equal to about 5.0. Compounds of interest also include those having a pIC50 for NEP≧about 6.0 or a pIC50 for NEP≧about 7.0. In another embodiment, compounds of interest have a pIC50 for NEP within the range of about 7.0-11.0; and in another embodiment, within the range of about 8.0-11.0, such as within the range of about 8.0-10.0. It is noted that in some cases, compounds of the invention may possess weak NEP inhibition activity. In such cases, those of skill in the art will recognize that these compounds still have utility as research tools. Exemplary assays to determine properties of compounds of the invention, such as the NEP inhibiting activity, are described in the Examples and include by way of illustration and not limitation, assays that measure NEP inhibition (described in Assay 1). Useful secondary assays include assays to measure ACE inhibition (also described in Assay 1) and aminopeptidase P (APP) inhibition (described in Sulpizio et al. (2005) JPET 315:1306-1313). A pharmacodynamic assay to assess the in vivo inhibitory potencies for ACE and NEP in anesthetized rats is described in Assay 2 (see also Seymour et al. (1985) Hypertension 7(Suppl I):I-35-I-42 and Wigle et al. (1992) Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 70:1525-1528), where ACE inhibition is measured as the percent inhibition of the angiotensin I pressor response and NEP inhibition is measured as increased urinary cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP) output. There are many in vivo assays that can be used to ascertain further utilities of the compounds of the invention. The conscious spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model is a renin dependent hypertension model, and is described in Assay 3. See also Intengan et al. (1999) Circulation 100(22):2267-2275 and Badyal et al. (2003) Indian Journal of Pharmacology 35:349-362. The conscious desoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-salt) rat model is a volume dependent hypertension model that is useful for measuring NEP activity, and is described in Assay 4. See also Trapani et al. (1989) J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 14:419-424, Intengan et al. (1999) Hypertension 34(4):907-913, and Badyal et al. (2003) supra). The DOCA-salt model is particularly useful for evaluating the ability of a test compound to reduce blood pressure as well as to measure a test compound's ability to prevent or delay a rise in blood pressure. The Dahl salt-sensive (DSS) hypertensive rat model is a model of hypertension that is sensitive to dietary salt (NaCl), and is described in Assay 5. See also Rapp (1982) Hypertension 4:753-763. The rat monocrotaline model of pulmonary arterial hypertension described, for example, in Kato et al. (2008) J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 51(1):18-23, is a reliable predictor of clinical efficacy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Heart failure animal models include the DSS rat model for heart failure and the aorto-caval fistula model (AV shunt), the latter of which is described, for example, in Norling et al. (1996) J. Amer. Soc. Nephrol. 7:1038-1044. Other animal models, such as the hot plate, tail-flick and formalin tests, can be used to measure the analgesic properties of compounds of the invention, as well as the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain. See, for example, Malmberg et al. (1999) Current Protocols in Neuroscience 8.9.1-8.9.15. Compounds of the invention are expected to inhibit the NEP enzyme in any of the assays listed above, or assays of a similar nature. Thus, the aforementioned assays are useful in determining the therapeutic utility of compounds of the invention, for example, their utility as antihypertensive agents or antidiarrheal agents. Other properties and utilities of compounds of the invention can be demonstrated using other in vitro and in vivo assays well-known to those skilled in the art. Compounds of formula I may be active drugs as well as prodrugs. Thus, when discussing the activity of compounds of the invention, it is understood that any such prodrugs may not exhibit the expected activity in an assay, but are expected to exhibit the desired activity once metabolized. Compounds of the invention are expected to be useful for the treatment and/or prevention of medical conditions responsive to NEP inhibition. Thus it is expected that patients suffering from a disease or disorder that is treated by inhibiting the NEP enzyme or by increasing the levels of its peptide substrates, can be treated by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. For example, by inhibiting NEP, the compounds are expected to potentiate the biological effects of endogenous peptides that are metabolized by NEP, such as the natriuretic peptides, bombesin, bradykinins, calcitonin, endothelins, enkephalins, neurotensin, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide. Thus, these compounds are expected to have other physiological actions, for example, on the renal, central nervous, reproductive and gastrointestinal systems. In one embodiment of the invention, patients suffering from a disease or disorder that is treated by inhibiting the NEP enzyme, are treated by administering a compound of the invention that is in its active form, i.e., a compound of formula I where R1 and R4 are H, and R2, R3, R5, R6, a, b, and Z are as defined for formula I. In another embodiment, patients are treated by administering a compound that is metabolized in vitro to form a compound of formula I where R1 and R4 are H, and R2, R2, R3, R5, R6, a, b, and Z are as defined for formula I. In another embodiment, patients are treated by administering a compound of the invention that is in its prodrug form at the R1 group, i.e., a compound of formula I where R1 is selected from —C1-8alkyl, —C1-3alkylene-C6-10aryl, —C1-3alkylene-C1-9heteroaryl, —C3-7cycloalkyl, —[(CH2)2O]1-3CH3, —C1-6alkylene-OC(O)R10, —C1-6alkylene-NR11R12, —C1-6alkylene-C(O)R13, —C0-6alkylenemorpholinyl, —C1-6alkylene-SO2—C1-6alkyl, In yet another embodiment, patients are treated by administering a compound of the invention that is in its prodrug form at the R4 group, i.e., a compound of formula I where R4 is selected from —C1-8alkyl, —C1-3alkylene-C6-10aryl, —C1-3alkylene-C1-9heteroaryl, —C3-7cycloalkyl, —[(CH2)2O]1-3CH3, —C1-6alkylene-OC(O)R40, —C1-6alkylene-NR41R42, —C1-6alkylene-C(O)R43, —C0-6alkylenemorpholinyl, —C1-6alkylene-SO2—C1-6alkyl, In still another embodiment, patients are treated by administering a compound of the invention that is in its prodrug form at the R1 group and at the R4 group. Cardiovascular Diseases By potentiating the effects of vasoactive peptides like the natriuretic peptides and bradykinin, compounds of the invention are expected to find utility in treating and/or preventing medical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases. See, for example, Roques et al. (1993) Pharmacol. Rev. 45:87-146 and Dempsey et al. (2009) Amer. J. of Pathology 174(3):782-796. Cardiovascular diseases of particular interest include hypertension and heart failure. Hypertension includes, by way of illustration and not limitation: primary hypertension, which is also referred to as essential hypertension or idiopathic hypertension; secondary hypertension; hypertension with accompanying renal disease; severe hypertension with or without accompanying renal disease; pulmonary hypertension, including pulmonary arterial hypertension; and resistant hypertension. Heart failure includes, by way of illustration and not limitation: congestive heart failure; acute heart failure; chronic heart failure, for example with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (also referred to as systolic heart failure) or with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (also referred to as diastolic heart failure); and acute and chronic decompensated heart failure, with or without accompanying renal disease. Thus, one embodiment of the invention relates to a method for treating hypertension, particularly primary hypertension or pulmonary arterial hypertension, comprising administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. For treatment of primary hypertension, the therapeutically effective amount is typically the amount that is sufficient to lower the patient's blood pressure. This would include both mild-to-moderate hypertension and severe hypertension. When used to treat hypertension, the compound may be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents such as aldosterone antagonists, aldosterone synthase inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and dual-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme/neprilysin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activators and stimulators, angiotensin-II vaccines, anti-diabetic agents, anti-lipid agents, anti-thrombotic agents, AT1 receptor antagonists and dual-acting AT1 receptor antagonist/neprilysin inhibitors, β1-adrenergic receptor antagonists, dual-acting β-adrenergic receptor antagonist/α1-receptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, endothelin receptor antagonists, endothelin converting enzyme inhibitors, neprilysin inhibitors, natriuretic peptides and their analogs, natriuretic peptide clearance receptor antagonists, nitric oxide donors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, phosphodiesterase inhibitors (specifically PDE-V inhibitors), prostaglandin receptor agonists, renin inhibitors, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators and activators, and combinations thereof. In one particular embodiment of the invention, a compound of the invention is combined with an AT1 receptor antagonist, a calcium channel blocker, a diuretic, or a combination thereof, and used to treat primary hypertension. In another particular embodiment of the invention, a compound of the invention is combined with an AT1 receptor antagonist, and used to treat hypertension with accompanying renal disease. When used to treat resistant hypertension, the compound may be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents such as aldosterone synthase inhibitors. For treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, the therapeutically effective amount is typically the amount that is sufficient to lower the pulmonary vascular resistance. Other goals of therapy are to improve a patient's exercise capacity. For example, in a clinical setting, the therapeutically effective amount can be the amount that improves a patient's ability to walk comfortably for a period of 6 minutes (covering a distance of approximately 20-40 meters). When used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension the compound may be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents such as α-adrenergic receptor antagonists, β1-adrenergic receptor antagonists, β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, anticoagulants, calcium channel blockers, diuretics, endothelin receptor antagonists, PDE-V inhibitors, prostaglandin analogs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and combinations thereof. In one particular embodiment of the invention, a compound of the invention is combined with a PDE-V inhibitor or a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. Another embodiment of the invention relates to a method for treating heart failure, in particular congestive heart failure (including both systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure), comprising administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Typically, the therapeutically effective amount is the amount that is sufficient to lower blood pressure and/or improve renal functions. In a clinical setting, the therapeutically effective amount can be the amount that is sufficient to improve cardiac hemodynamics, like for instance reduction in wedge pressure, right atrial pressure, filling pressure, and vascular resistance. In one embodiment, the compound is administered as an intravenous dosage form. When used to treat heart failure, the compound may be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents such as adenosine receptor antagonists, advanced glycation end product breakers, aldosterone antagonists, AT1 receptor antagonists, β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, dual-acting β-adrenergic receptor antagonist/α1-receptor antagonists, chymase inhibitors, digoxin, diuretics, endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists, natriuretic peptides and their analogs, natriuretic peptide clearance receptor antagonists, nitric oxide donors, prostaglandin analogs, PDE-V inhibitors, soluble guanylate cyclase activators and stimulators, and vasopressin receptor antagonists. In one particular embodiment of the invention, a compound of the invention is combined with an aldosterone antagonist, a β1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, an AT1 receptor antagonist, or a diuretic, and used to treat congestive heart failure. Diarrhea As NEP inhibitors, compounds of the invention are expected to inhibit the degradation of endogenous enkephalins and thus such compounds may also find utility for the treatment of diarrhea, including infectious and secretory/watery diarrhea. See, for example, Baumer et al. (1992) Gut 33:753-758; Farthing (2006) Digestive Diseases 24:47-58; and Marçais-Collado (1987) Eur. J. Pharmacol. 144(2):125-132. When used to treat diarrhea, compounds of the invention may be combined with one or more additional antidiarrheal agents. Renal Diseases By potentiating the effects of vasoactive peptides like the natriuretic peptides and bradykinin, compounds of the invention are expected to enhance renal function (see Chen et al. (1999) Circulation 100:2443-2448; Lipkin et al. (1997) Kidney Int. 52:792-801; and Dussaule et al. (1993) Clin. Sci. 84:31-39) and find utility in treating and/or preventing renal diseases. Renal diseases of particular interest include diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease, proteinuria, and particularly acute kidney injury or acute renal failure (see Sharkovska et al. (2011) Clin. Lab. 57:507-515 and Newaz et al. (2010) Renal Failure 32:384-390). When used to treat renal disease, the compound may be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT1 receptor antagonists, and diuretics. Preventative Therapy By potentiating the effects of the natriuretic peptides, compounds of the invention are also expected to be useful in preventative therapy, due to the antihypertrophic and antifibrotic effects of the natriuretic peptides (see Potter et al. (2009) Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology 191:341-366), for example in preventing the progression of cardiac insufficiency after myocardial infarction, preventing arterial restenosis after angioplasty, preventing thickening of blood vessel walls after vascular operations, preventing atherosclerosis, and preventing diabetic angiopathy. Glaucoma By potentiating the effects of the natriuretic peptides, compounds of the invention are expected to be useful to treat glaucoma. See, for example, Diestelhorst et al. (1989) International Ophthalmology 12:99-101. When used to treat glaucoma, compounds of the invention may be combined with one or more additional antiglaucoma agents. Pain Relief As NEP inhibitors, compounds of the invention are expected to inhibit the degradation of endogenous enkephalins and thus such compounds may also find utility as analgesics. See, for example, Roques et al. (1980) Nature 288:286-288 and Thanawala et al. (2008) Current Drug Targets 9:887-894. When used to treat pain, the compounds of the invention may be combined with one or more additional antinociceptive drugs such as aminopeptidase N or dipeptidyl peptidase III inhibitors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, monoamine reuptake inhibitors, muscle relaxants, NMDA receptor antagonists, opioid receptor agonists, 5-HT1D serotonin receptor agonists, and tricyclic antidepressants. Other Utilities Due to their NEP inhibition properties, compounds of the invention are also expected to be useful as antitussive agents, as well as find utility in the treatment of portal hypertension associated with liver cirrhosis (see Sansoe et al. (2005) J. Hepatol. 43:791-798), cancer (see Vesely (2005) J. Investigative Med. 53:360-365), depression (see Noble et al. (2007) Exp. Opin. Ther. Targets 11:145-159), menstrual disorders, preterm labor, pre-eclampsia, endometriosis, reproductive disorders (for example, male and female infertility, polycystic ovarian syndrome, implantation failure), and male and female sexual dysfunction, including male erectile dysfunction and female sexual arousal disorder. More specifically, the compounds of the invention are expected to be useful in treating female sexual dysfunction (see Pryde et al. (2006) J. Med. Chem. 49:4409-4424), which is often defined as a female patient's difficulty or inability to find satisfaction in sexual expression. This covers a variety of diverse female sexual disorders including, by way of illustration and not limitation, hypoactive sexual desire disorder, sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic disorder and sexual pain disorder. When used to treat such disorders, especially female sexual dysfunction, compounds of the invention may be combined with one or more of the following secondary agents: PDE-V inhibitors, dopamine agonists, estrogen receptor agonists and/or antagonists, androgens, and estrogens. Due to their NEP inhibition properties, compounds of the invention are also expected to have anti-inflammatory properties, and are expected to have utility as such, particularly when used in combination with statins. Recent studies suggest that NEP plays a role in regulating nerve function in insulin-deficient diabetes and diet induced obesity. Coppey et al. (2011) Neuropharmacology 60:259-266. Therefore, due to their NEP inhibition properties, compounds of the invention are also expected to be useful in providing protection from nerve impairment caused by diabetes or diet induced obesity. The amount of the compound of the invention administered per dose or the total amount administered per day may be predetermined or it may be determined on an individual patient basis by taking into consideration numerous factors, including the nature and severity of the patient's condition, the condition being treated, the age, weight, and general health of the patient, the tolerance of the patient to the active agent, the route of administration, pharmacological considerations such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and toxicology profiles of the compound and any secondary agents being administered, and the like. Treatment of a patient suffering from a disease or medical condition (such as hypertension) can begin with a predetermined dosage or a dosage determined by the treating physician, and will continue for a period of time necessary to prevent, ameliorate, suppress, or alleviate the symptoms of the disease or medical condition. Patients undergoing such treatment will typically be monitored on a routine basis to determine the effectiveness of therapy. For example, in treating hypertension, blood pressure measurements may be used to determine the effectiveness of treatment. Similar indicators for other diseases and conditions described herein, are well known and are readily available to the treating physician. Continuous monitoring by the physician will insure that the optimal amount of the compound of the invention will be administered at any given time, as well as facilitating the determination of the duration of treatment. This is of particular value when secondary agents are also being administered, as their selection, dosage, and duration of therapy may also require adjustment. In this way, the treatment regimen and dosing schedule can be adjusted over the course of therapy so that the lowest amount of active agent that exhibits the desired effectiveness is administered and, further, that administration is continued only so long as is necessary to successfully treat the disease or medical condition. Research Tools Since compounds of the invention possess NEP enzyme inhibition activity, such compounds are also useful as research tools for investigating or studying biological systems or samples having a NEP enzyme, for example to study diseases where the NEP enzyme or its peptide substrates plays a role. Any suitable biological system or sample having a NEP enzyme may be employed in such studies which may be conducted either in vitro or in vivo. Representative biological systems or samples suitable for such studies include, but are not limited to, cells, cellular extracts, plasma membranes, tissue samples, isolated organs, mammals (such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, humans, and so forth), and the like, with mammals being of particular interest. In one particular embodiment of the invention, NEP enzyme activity in a mammal is inhibited by administering a NEP-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention. Compounds of the invention can also be used as research tools by conducting biological assays using such compounds. When used as a research tool, a biological system or sample comprising a NEP enzyme is typically contacted with a NEP enzyme-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention. After the biological system or sample is exposed to the compound, the effects of inhibiting the NEP enzyme are determined using conventional procedures and equipment, such as by measuring receptor binding in a binding assay or measuring ligand-mediated changes in a functional assay. Exposure encompasses contacting cells or tissue with the compound, administering the compound to a mammal, for example by i.p., p.o, i.v., s.c., or inhaled administration, and so forth. This determining step can involve measuring a response (a quantitative analysis) or can involve making an observation (a qualitative analysis). Measuring a response involves, for example, determining the effects of the compound on the biological system or sample using conventional procedures and equipment, such as enzyme activity assays and measuring enzyme substrate or product mediated changes in functional assays. The assay results can be used to determine the activity level as well as the amount of compound necessary to achieve the desired result, that is, a NEP enzyme-inhibiting amount. Typically, the determining step will involve determining the effects of inhibiting the NEP enzyme. Additionally, compounds of the invention can be used as research tools for evaluating other chemical compounds, and thus are also useful in screening assays to discover, for example, new compounds having NEP-inhibiting activity. In this manner, a compound of the invention is used as a standard in an assay to allow comparison of the results obtained with a test compound and with compounds of the invention to identify those test compounds that have about equal or superior activity, if any. For example, pKi data for a test compound or a group of test compounds is compared to the pKi data for a compound of the invention to identify those test compounds that have the desired properties, for example, test compounds having a pKi value about equal or superior to a compound of the invention, if any. This aspect of the invention includes, as separate embodiments, both the generation of comparison data (using the appropriate assays) and the analysis of test data to identify test compounds of interest. Thus, a test compound can be evaluated in a biological assay, by a method comprising the steps of: (a) conducting a biological assay with a test compound to provide a first assay value; (b) conducting the biological assay with a compound of the invention to provide a second assay value; wherein step (a) is conducted either before, after or concurrently with step (b); and (c) comparing the first assay value from step (a) with the second assay value from step (b). Exemplary biological assays include a NEP enzyme inhibition assay. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Formulations Compounds of the invention are typically administered to a patient in the form of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to the patient by any acceptable route of administration including, but not limited to, oral, rectal, vaginal, nasal, inhaled, topical (including transdermal), ocular, and parenteral modes of administration. Further, the compounds of the invention may be administered, for example orally, in multiple doses per day (for example, two, three, or four times daily), in a single daily dose or a single weekly dose. It will be understood that any form of the compounds of the invention, (that is, free base, free acid, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, etc.) that is suitable for the particular mode of administration can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions discussed herein. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound of the invention. The compositions may contain other therapeutic and/or formulating agents if desired. When discussing compositions, the “compound of the invention” may also be referred to herein as the “active agent,” to distinguish it from other components of the formulation, such as the carrier. Thus, it is understood that the term “active agent” includes compounds of formula I as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs of that compound. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention typically contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Those skilled in the art will recognize, however, that a pharmaceutical composition may contain more than a therapeutically effective amount, such as in bulk compositions, or less than a therapeutically effective amount, that is, individual unit doses designed for multiple administration to achieve a therapeutically effective amount. Typically, the composition will contain from about 0.01-95 wt % of active agent, including, from about 0.01-30 wt %, such as from about 0.01-10 wt %, with the actual amount depending upon the formulation itself, the route of administration, the frequency of dosing, and so forth. In one embodiment, a composition suitable for an oral dosage form, for example, may contain about 5-70 wt %, or from about 10-60 wt % of active agent. Any conventional carrier or excipient may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. The choice of a particular carrier or excipient, or combinations of carriers or excipients, will depend on the mode of administration being used to treat a particular patient or type of medical condition or disease state. In this regard, the preparation of a suitable composition for a particular mode of administration is well within the scope of those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts. Additionally, carriers or excipients used in such compositions are commercially available. By way of further illustration, conventional formulation techniques are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, Lippincott Williams & White, Baltimore, Md. (2000); and H. C. Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 7th Edition, Lippincott Williams & White, Baltimore, Md. (1999). Representative examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, the following: sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose, such as microcrystalline cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols, such as propylene glycol; polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol; phosphate buffer solutions; compressed propellant gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons; and other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions are typically prepared by thoroughly and intimately mixing or blending the active agent with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and one or more optional ingredients. The resulting uniformly blended mixture may then be shaped or loaded into tablets, capsules, pills, canisters, cartridges, dispensers and the like using conventional procedures and equipment. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for oral administration. Suitable compositions for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, tablets, pills, lozenges, cachets, dragees, powders, granules; solutions or suspensions in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsions; elixirs or syrups; and the like; each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent. When intended for oral administration in a solid dosage form (capsules, tablets, pills and the like), the composition will typically comprise the active agent and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate. Solid dosage forms may also comprise: fillers or extenders, such as starches, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; binders, such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; humectants, such as glycerol; disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and/or sodium carbonate; solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; wetting agents, such as cetyl alcohol and/or glycerol monostearate; absorbents, such as kaolin and/or bentonite clay; lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and/or mixtures thereof; coloring agents; and buffering agents. Release agents, wetting agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants may also be present in the pharmaceutical compositions. Exemplary coating agents for tablets, capsules, pills and like, include those used for enteric coatings, such as cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, methacrylic acid-methacrylic acid ester copolymers, cellulose acetate trimellitate, carboxymethyl ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate, and the like. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: water-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfate sodium sulfite and the like; oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and metal-chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Compositions may also be formulated to provide slow or controlled release of the active agent using, by way of example, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose in varying proportions or other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. In addition, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may contain opacifying agents and may be formulated so that they release the active agent only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active agent can also be in micro-encapsulated form, optionally with one or more of the above-described excipients. Suitable liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, by way of illustration, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. Liquid dosage forms typically comprise the active agent and an inert diluent, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (for example, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Suspensions may contain suspending agents such as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminium metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof. When intended for oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be packaged in a unit dosage form. The term “unit dosage form” refers to a physically discrete unit suitable for dosing a patient, that is, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of the active agent calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect either alone or in combination with one or more additional units. For example, such unit dosage forms may be capsules, tablets, pills, and the like. In another embodiment, the compositions of the invention are suitable for inhaled administration, and will typically be in the form of an aerosol or a powder. Such compositions are generally administered using well-known delivery devices, such as a nebulizer, dry powder, or metered-dose inhaler. Nebulizer devices produce a stream of high velocity air that causes the composition to spray as a mist that is carried into a patient's respiratory tract. An exemplary nebulizer formulation comprises the active agent dissolved in a carrier to form a solution, or micronized and combined with a carrier to form a suspension of micronized particles of respirable size. Dry powder inhalers administer the active agent as a free-flowing powder that is dispersed in a patient's air-stream during inspiration. An exemplary dry powder formulation comprises the active agent dry-blended with an excipient such as lactose, starch, mannitol, dextrose, polylactic acid, polylactide-co-glycolide, and combinations thereof. Metered-dose inhalers discharge a measured amount of the active agent using compressed propellant gas. An exemplary metered-dose formulation comprises a solution or suspension of the active agent in a liquefied propellant, such as a chlorofluorocarbon or hydrofluoroalkane. Optional components of such formulations include co-solvents, such as ethanol or pentane, and surfactants, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, lecithin, glycerin, and sodium lauryl sulfate. Such compositions are typically prepared by adding chilled or pressurized hydrofluoroalkane to a suitable container containing the active agent, ethanol (if present) and the surfactant (if present). To prepare a suspension, the active agent is micronized and then combined with the propellant. Alternatively, a suspension formulation can be prepared by spray drying a coating of surfactant on micronized particles of the active agent. The formulation is then loaded into an aerosol canister, which forms a portion of the inhaler. Compounds of the invention can also be administered parenterally (for example, by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal injection). For such administration, the active agent is provided in a sterile solution, suspension, or emulsion. Exemplary solvents for preparing such formulations include water, saline, low molecular weight alcohols such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, oils, gelatin, fatty acid esters such as ethyl oleate, and the like. Parenteral formulations may also contain one or more anti-oxidants, solubilizers, stabilizers, preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifiers, and dispersing agents. Surfactants, additional stabilizing agents or pH-adjusting agents (acids, bases or buffers) and anti-oxidants are particularly useful to provide stability to the formulation, for example, to minimize or avoid hydrolysis of ester and amide linkages that may be present in the compound. These formulations may be rendered sterile by use of a sterile injectable medium, a sterilizing agent, filtration, irradiation, or heat. In one particular embodiment, the parenteral formulation comprises an aqueous cyclodextrin solution as the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable cyclodextrins include cyclic molecules containing six or more α-D-glucopyranose units linked at the 1,4 positions by a linkages as in amylase, β-cyclodextrin or cycloheptaamylose. Exemplary cyclodextrins include cyclodextrin derivatives such as hydroxypropyl and sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrins such as hydroxypropyl-p-cyclodextrin and sulfobutyl ether β-cyclodextrin. Exemplary buffers for such formulations include carboxylic acid-based buffers such as citrate, lactate and maleate buffer solutions. Compounds of the invention can also be administered transdermally using known transdermal delivery systems and excipients. For example, the compound can be admixed with permeation enhancers, such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol monolaurate, azacycloalkan-2-ones and the like, and incorporated into a patch or similar delivery system. Additional excipients including gelling agents, emulsifiers and buffers, may be used in such transdermal compositions if desired. Secondary Agents The compounds of the invention may be useful as the sole treatment of a disease or may be combined with one or more additional therapeutic agents in order to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. Thus, in one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention contain other drugs that are co-administered with a compound of the invention. For example, the composition may further comprise one or more drugs (also referred to as “secondary agents(s)”). Such therapeutic agents are well known in the art, and include adenosine receptor antagonists, α-adrenergic receptor antagonists, β1-adrenergic receptor antagonists, β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, dual-acting β-adrenergic receptor antagonist/α1-receptor antagonists, advanced glycation end product breakers, aldosterone antagonists, aldosterone synthase inhibitors, aminopeptidase N inhibitors, androgens, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and dual-acting angiotensin-converting enzyme/neprilysin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activators and stimulators, angiotensin-II vaccines, anticoagulants, anti-diabetic agents, antidiarrheal agents, anti-glaucoma agents, anti-lipid agents, antinociceptive agents, anti-thrombotic agents, AT1 receptor antagonists and dual-acting AT1 receptor antagonist/neprilysin inhibitors and multifunctional angiotensin receptor blockers, bradykinin receptor antagonists, calcium channel blockers, chymase inhibitors, digoxin, diuretics, dopamine agonists, endothelin converting enzyme inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, estrogens, estrogen receptor agonists and/or antagonists, monoamine reuptake inhibitors, muscle relaxants, natriuretic peptides and their analogs, natriuretic peptide clearance receptor antagonists, neprilysin inhibitors, nitric oxide donors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, N-methyl d-aspartate receptor antagonists, opioid receptor agonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, prostaglandin analogs, prostaglandin receptor agonists, renin inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sodium channel blocker, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators and activators, tricyclic antidepressants, vasopressin receptor antagonists, and combinations thereof. Specific examples of these agents are detailed herein. Accordingly, in yet another aspect of the invention, a pharmaceutical composition comprises a compound of the invention, a second active agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Third, fourth etc. active agents may also be included in the composition. In combination therapy, the amount of compound of the invention that is administered, as well as the amount of secondary agents, may be less than the amount typically administered in monotherapy. Compounds of the invention may be physically mixed with the second active agent to form a composition containing both agents; or each agent may be present in separate and distinct compositions which are administered to the patient simultaneously or at separate times. For example, a compound of the invention can be combined with a second active agent using conventional procedures and equipment to form a combination of active agents comprising a compound of the invention and a second active agent. Additionally, the active agents may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention, a second active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In this embodiment, the components of the composition are typically mixed or blended to create a physical mixture. The physical mixture is then administered in a therapeutically effective amount using any of the routes described herein. Alternatively, the active agents may remain separate and distinct before administration to the patient. In this embodiment, the agents are not physically mixed together before administration but are administered simultaneously or at separate times as separate compositions. Such compositions can be packaged separately or may be packaged together in a kit. When administered at separate times, the secondary agent will typically be administered less than 24 hours after administration of the compound of the invention, ranging anywhere from concurrent with administration of the compound of the invention to about 24 hours post-dose. This is also referred to as sequential administration. Thus, a compound of the invention can be orally administered simultaneously or sequentially with another active agent using two tablets, with one tablet for each active agent, where sequential may mean being administered immediately after administration of the compound of the invention or at some predetermined time later (for example, one hour later or three hours later). It is also contemplated that the secondary agent may be administered more than 24 hours after administration of the compound of the invention. Alternatively, the combination may be administered by different routes of administration, that is, one orally and the other by inhalation. In one embodiment, the kit comprises a first dosage form comprising a compound of the invention and at least one additional dosage form comprising one or more of the secondary agents set forth herein, in quantities sufficient to carry out the methods of the invention. The first dosage form and the second (or third, etc.) dosage form together comprise a therapeutically effective amount of active agents for the treatment or prevention of a disease or medical condition in a patient. Secondary agent(s), when included, are present in a therapeutically effective amount such that they are typically administered in an amount that produces a therapeutically beneficial effect when co-administered with a compound of the invention. The secondary agent can be in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, optically pure stereoisomer, and so forth. The secondary agent may also be in the form of a prodrug, for example, a compound having a carboxylic acid group that has been esterified. Thus, secondary agents listed herein are intended to include all such forms, and are commercially available or can be prepared using conventional procedures and reagents.

Assay 1 In Vitro Assays for the Quantitation of Inhibitor Potencies at Human and Rat NEP, and Human ACE The inhibitory activities of compounds at human and rat neprilysin (EC 3.4.24.11; NEP) and human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) were determined using in vitro assays as described below. Extraction of NEP Activity from Rat Kidneys Rat NEP was prepared from the kidneys of adult Sprague Dawley rats. Whole kidneys were washed in cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and brought up in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-114, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) pH 7.5; Bordier (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256: 1604-1607) in a ratio of 5 mL of buffer for every gram of kidney. Samples were homogenized on ice using a polytron hand held tissue grinder. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000×g in a swinging bucket rotor for 5 minutes at 3° C. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mL of ice cold lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Samples (15-20 mL) were then layered onto 25 mL of ice-cold cushion buffer (6% w/v sucrose, 50 mM pH 7.5 Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.06%, Triton X-114), heated to 37° C. for 3-5 minutes and centrifuged at 1000×g in a swinging bucket rotor at room temperature for 3 minutes. The two upper layers were aspirated off, leaving a viscous oily precipitate containing the enriched membrane fraction. Glycerol was added to a concentration of 50% and samples were stored at −20° C. Protein concentrations were quantitated using a BCA detection system with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Enzyme Inhibition Assays Recombinant human NEP and recombinant human ACE were obtained commercially (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., catalog numbers 1182-ZN and 929-ZN, respectively). The fluorogenic peptide substrate Mca-D-Arg-Arg-Leu-Dap-(Dnp)-OH (Medeiros et al. (1997) Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 30:1157-62; Anaspec, San Jose, Calif.) and Abz-Phe-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-Pro-OH (Araujo et al. (2000) Biochemistry 39:8519-8525; Bachem, Torrance, Calif.) were used in the NEP and ACE assays respectively. The assays were performed in 384-well white opaque plates at 37° C. using the fluorogenic peptide substrates at a concentration of 10 μM in Assay Buffer (NEP: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.01% polyethylene glycol sorbitan monolaurate (Tween-20), 10 μM ZnSO4; ACE: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.01% Tween-20, 1 μM ZnSO4). The respective enzymes were used at concentrations that resulted in quantitative proteolysis of 1 μM of substrate after 20 minutes at 37° C. Test compounds were assayed over the range of concentrations from 10 μM to 20 pM. Test compounds were added to the enzymes and incubated for 30 minute at 37° C. prior to initiating the reaction by the addition of substrate. Reactions were terminated after 20 minutes of incubation at 37° C. by the addition of glacial acetic acid to a final concentration of 3.6% (v/v). Plates were read on a fluorometer with excitation and emission wavelengths set to 320 nm and 405 nm, respectively. Inhibition constants were obtained by nonlinear regression of the data using the equation (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.): [in-line-formulae]ν=ν0/[1+(I/K′)][/in-line-formulae] where ν is the reaction rate, ν0 is the uninhibited reaction rate, I is the inhibitor concentration and K′ is the apparent inhibition constant.

Once anesthetized, the jugular vein, carotid artery (PE 50 tubing) and bladder (flared PE 50 tubing) catheters are cannulated and a tracheotomy is performed (Teflon Needle, size 14 gauge) to faciliate spontaneous respiration. The animals are then allowed a 60 minute stabilization period and kept continuously infused with 5 mL/kg/h of saline (0.9%) throughout, to keep them hydrated and ensure urine production. Body temperature is maintained throughout the experiment by use of a heating pad. At the end of the 60 minute stabilization period, the animals are dosed intravenously (i.v.) with two doses of AngI (1.0 g/kg, for ACE inhibitor activity) at 15 minutes apart. At 15 minutes post-second dose of AngI, the animals are treated with vehicle or test compound. Five minutes later, the animals are additionally treated with a bolus i.v. injection of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP; 30 g/kg). Urine collection (into pre-weighted eppendorf tubes) is started immediately after the ANP treatment and continued for 60 minutes. At 30 and 60 minutes into urine collection, the animals are re-challenged with AngI. Blood pressure measurements are done using the Notocord system (Kalamazoo, Mich.). Urine samples are frozen at −20° C. until used for the cGMP assay. Urine cGMP concentrations are determined by Enzyme Immuno Assay using a commercial kit (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, Mich., Cat. No. 901-013). Urine volume is determined gravimetrically. Urinary cGMP output is calculated as the product of urine output and urine cGMP concentration. ACE inhibition is assessed by quantifying the % inhibition of pressor response to AngI. NEP inhibition is assessed by quantifying the potentiation of ANP-induced elevation in urinary cGMP output. Assay 3 In Vivo Evaluation of Antihypertensive Effects in the Conscious SHR Model of Hypertension Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 14-20 weeks of age) are allowed a minimum of 48 hours acclimation upon arrival at the testing site with free access to food and water. For blood pressure recording, these animals are surgically implanted with small rodent radiotransmitters (telemetry unit; DSI Models TA11PA-C40 or C50-PXT, Data Science Inc., USA). The tip of the catheter connected to the transmitter is inserted into the descending aorta above the iliac bifurcation and secured in place with tissue adhesive. The transmitter is kept intraperitoneally and secured to the abdominal wall while closing of the abdominal incision with a non-absorbable suture. The outer skin is closed with suture and staples. The animals are allowed to recover with appropriate post operative care. On the day of the experiment, the animals in their cages are placed on top of the telemetry receiver units to acclimate to the testing environment and baseline recording. After at least of 2 hours baseline measurement is taken, the animals are then dosed with vehicle or test compound and followed out to 24 hours post-dose blood pressure measurement. Data is recorded continuously for the duration of the study using Notocord software (Kalamazoo, Mich.) and stored as electronic digital signals. Parameters measured are blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure) and heart rate. Assay 4 In Vivo Evaluation of Antihypertensive Effects in the Conscious DOCA-Salt Rat Model of Hypertension CD rats (male, adult, 200-300 grams, Charles River Laboratory, USA) are allowed a minimum of 48 hours acclimation upon arrival at the testing site before they are placed on a high salt diet. One week after the start of the high salt diet (8% in food or 1% NaCl in drinking water), a deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) pellet (100 mg, 90 days release time, Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, Fla.) is implanted subcutaneously and unilateral nephrectomy is performed. At this time, the animals are also surgically implanted with small rodent radiotransmitters for blood pressure measurement (see Assay 3 for details). The animals are allowed to recover with appropriate post operative care. Study design, data recording, and parameters measured is similar to that described for Assay 3. Assay 5 In Vivo Evaluation of Antihypertensive Effects in the Conscious Dahl/SS Rat Model of Hypertension Male, Dahl salt sensitive rats (Dahl/SS, 6-7 weeks of age from Charles River Laboratory, USA) are allowed at least 48 hours of acclimation upon arrival at the testing site before they were placed on a 8% NaCl high salt diet (TD.92012, Harlan, USA) then surgically implanted with small rodent radiotransmitters for blood pressure measurement (see Assay 3 for details). The animals are allowed to recover with appropriate post operative care. At approximately 4 to 5 weeks from the start of high salt diet, these animals are expected to become hypertensive. Once the hypertension level is confirmed, these animals are used for the study while continued with the high salt diet to maintain their hypertension level. Study design, data recording, and parameters measured is similar to that described in Assay 3.
