The player will win half of the bet if the remaining two cards do add up to a total value of 5. If the player-dealer qualifying hands, both meet the qualifying requirement of adding up to a total value of 10, 20 or 30, then the player-dealer showdown hands will be compared for the highest total points ranking of the remaining two cards. The total points rankings of the remaining two cards ranged from one to ten, with ten being the highest. The showdown hand, having the highest total points ranking win the bet. The card value point(s) and showdown hand total points rankings are listed below: Card Values Point(s) Ace card =1 point 2 card =2 points 3 card =3 points 4 card =4 points 5 card =5 points 6 card =6 points 7 card =7 points 8 card =8 points 9 card =9 points 10 card (Jack, Queen, and King) =10 points Sum of the Two-Cards Showdown Hand Total Points (Showdown Hand) values rankings (1= lowest and 10 = highest) 11 points (Ace, 10 card value) =1 12 points =2 13 points =3 14 points =4 15 points =5 16 points =6 17 points =7 18 points =8 19 points =9 20 points =10 21 points =1 22 points =2 23 points =3 There are a number of optional variations which may be combined as desired.

However, other number of cards are contemplated for qualifying hand and showdown hand combinations. For example, it is contemplated that combinations such as four cards qualifying hand and two cards showdown hand, five cards qualifying hand and two cards showdown hand, four cards qualifying hand and three cards showdown hand may be used. To qualify, the sum of the four cards that constitute player's qualifying hand must add up to 10, 20, 30 or 40; and for five cards player's qualifying hand, it must add up to 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50.

The total points rankings for the showdown hand is merely a convenience and is not limited in this respect and can vary as desired. Optionally, a bonus bet may be played as an adjunct to the regular game. In addition to the regular bet placed on the designated ANTE placement circle on the playing surface, Players may optionally place a separate wager in the designated BONUS placement circle on the playing surface to bet on the five cards dealt to attain one of a predetermined poker hands shown on the playing surface with or without the presence of joker card.

Bonus Bet Payout Schedule Poker hand rankings Multiples of player wager 5 Aces 5000 to 1 Royal Flush (No Joker) 1000 to 1 Royal Flush (With Joker) 250 to 1 Straight Flush 100 to 1 Four of a kind 50 to 1 Full house 20 to 1 Flush 15 to 1 Straight 12 to 1 Three of a kind 10 to 1 Two pair 9 to 1 Maximum payout $ 50,000 per hand. Minimum Dollar Bet = $1 Maximum Dollar Bet = $100 There are a number of optional enhancements which may be combined as desired. The use of standard poker rankings to determine the payouts in the bonus bet is merely a convenience. It is used primarily because most people know the rankings and know that it is more difficult to get a straight than to get a pair. However, other card combinations are contemplated for determining payouts, for example, a hand of all even/odd numbered cards or a hand with at least one card from each suit. Another variation of the game is to create a side pot where all players contribute to the side pot and the player having the best hand wins the side pot. Optionally, a Tie Hands bet may also be played as an adjunct to the regular game. In addition to the regular bet placed on the designated ANTE placement circle on the playing surface, Players may optionally place a separate wager in the designated Tie Hands bet placement circle on the playing surface to bet on both player and dealer's showdown hands will attain the same total points ranking. The amount of payouts for the Tie Hands bet in the preferred payouts is eight times the amount that the player wagered. Whilst the card game is described particularly for play as a table game in a gaming establishment, it is not limited in this respect. It may also be adapted to video play format to be played for example, in a domestic or mobile environment, electronic gaming machines, internet or in the format of a video game, slot machine, parlor game or the like.
