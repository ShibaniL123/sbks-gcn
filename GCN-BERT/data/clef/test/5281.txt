Step 3
4-Methyl-6-(3-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)propyl)-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-5,7-dione
3-(3-Methylisoxazol-5-yl)propyl methanesulfonate (30.0 mg, 0.136 mmol), 4-methyl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-5,7-dione (33.9 mg, 0.136 mmol), potassium carbonate (37.8 mg, 0.273 mmol) and potassium iodide (4.5 mg, 0.027 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (5 mL). The reaction was heated to 120Â°C and stirred for 3 hours. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, poured into water (20 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL x 3). The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated. The residue was purified by preparative HPLC to give 4-Methyl-6-(3-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)propyl)-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-5,7-dione (20.0 mg) with a yield of 39%.
