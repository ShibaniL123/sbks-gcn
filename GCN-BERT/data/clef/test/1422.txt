trans-4-Amino-1-[6-(3-cyano-2-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(3,5-difluorophenyl)quinolin-4-yl]piperidine-3-carboxamide (Compound No. 2-146)
Step 30-1, preparation of tert-butyl N-trans-3-carbamoyl-1-{6-[3-cyano-2-(methoxymethoxy)phenyl]-3-(3,5-difluorophenyl)quinolin-4-yl}piperidin-4-yl]carbamate: To a solution of trans-4-{[(tert-butoxy)carbonyl]amino}-1-{6-[3-cyano-2-(methoxymethoxy)phenyl]-3-(3,5-difluorophenyl)quinolin-4-yl}piperidine-3-carboxylic acid (30.0 mg, 0.0465 mmol) and 1-[bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxide hexafluorophosphate (26.5 mg, 0.0617 mmol) in DMF (2 mL) in a sealed tube was added diisopropylethylamine (0.12 mL, 0.689 mmol). After stirring at RT for 5 min, ammonium chloride (24.9 mg, 0.465 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred at RT overnight. The mixture was purified by reversed-phase column chromatography (neutralized with saturated NaHCO3 (aq)) to afford the title compound (19.4 mg, 0.0301 mmol, 64.7% yield) as a yellow solid. MS (M+1)+=644.1.
