Step 9
4-Methyl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-5,7-dione
4-(Methylamino)-2-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)pyrazole-5-carboxamide (2.70 g, 12.2 mmol) and 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole (3.94 g, 24.3 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (20 mL) and the reaction was heated to 140Â°C for 1 hour. After cooling to room temperature, water (100 mL) was added to the reaction mixture, and the solid was precipitated and was collected by filtration and dried to give 4-methyl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-5,7-dione (1.80 g, as a white solid) with a yield of 60%.
