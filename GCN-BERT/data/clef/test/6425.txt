The fourth step
To a solution of Compound 68 (120mg, 0.178mmol) in methanol (1.8 mL) was added sodium borohydride (269mg, 7.11mmol) under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 40 minutes. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 69 (107mg, yield 76%).
