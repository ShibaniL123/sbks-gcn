Example 13C
rac-(2R,3S,5R)-ethyl 3-(tert-butyl)-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-4-hydroxy-5-(2-methoxyphenyl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylate
To a solution of rac-(2R,3S,5R)-ethyl 3-(tert-butyl)-1-(cyclohexanecarbonyl)-5-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (Example 13B, 4.32 g, 10.07 mmol) in ethanol (30 mL) was added sodium borohydride (0.761 g, 20.14 mmol) at 0° C. The mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 1 hour and was diluted with water (20 mL). The mixture was concentrated. The residue was extracted with dichloromethane (20 mL×3). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (100 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to provide a residue which was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluted with 1/2 ethyl acetate/petroleum ether) to provide the title compound (3.23 g, 7.49 mmol, 29.4% yield).
