Step a)
2-(3-Methyl-4-nitrophenoxymethyl)benzothiazole
The compound (CAS Registry Number 197364-74-2) was synthesized according to a procedure described in the literature (J. Med. Chem. 30/2, 400-405 (1987)). A mixture of 2-chloromethylbenzothiazole (3 mmol, 551 mg), of 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol (3 mmol, 459 mg), caesium carbonate (3 mmol, 977 mg), sodium carbonate (3 mmol, 318 mg), potassium iodide (1 mmol, 150 mg) and acetone (40 mL) was heated at reflux until the starting material was consumed as determined by tlc (ca. 6 h). The mixture was filtered and the resulting solution was partially concentrated in vacuo. The crystals thus formed were isolated, washed with acetone, and dried to give 663 mg (74 % yield) of the pure product as light orange crystals, mp 146-148 °C.
IR: no characteristic absorption bands. 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6) δ [ppm]: 8.15-8.00 (m, 3H, arene H), 7.58-7.42 (m, 2H, arene H), 7.23 (d, J = 2.8 Hz, 1H, arene H), 7.14 (dd, J = 9.0, 2.8 Hz, 1H, arene H), 5.74 (s, 2H, CH2), 2.54 (s, 3H, CH3).
