Example 10: Synthesis of (R)-3-aminoquinuclidine.monoterephthalate
Methanol suspension (35.21 g) containing terephthalic acid (5.26 g: 31.7 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and methanol solution (12.08 g) containing (R)-3-aminoquinuclidine (4.05 g: 32.1 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain (R)-3-aminoquinuclidine.monoterephthalate (8.12 g: 27.7 mmol, yield=87%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 250° C.
