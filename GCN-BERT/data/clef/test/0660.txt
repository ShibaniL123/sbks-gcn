Step 3: Synthesis of 6-(3-methoxyprop-1-yn-1-yl)-1',2',3',6'-tetrahydro-3,4'-bipyridine 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate
To a solution of tert-butyl 6-(3-methoxyprop-1-yn-1-yl)-3',6'-dihydro-[3,4'-bipyridine]-1'(2'H)-carboxylate (2 g, 1 eq) in dichloromethane (90 ml) was added with trifluoroacetic acid (50 ml, excess) at 0Â° C. The mixture was stirred for 2 hr at room temperature and concentrated in vacuo to prepare the title compound (2 g, 96%).
