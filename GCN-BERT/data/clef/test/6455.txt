Step 3: 2-((3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1 H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl acetate
To a solution of 3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-amine chlorohydrate (3.09 g, 13.8 mmol) in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (60 mL) was added Et3N (4.20 mL, 30.3 mmol) under argon. The mixture was cooled to -10 Â°C and acetoxy acetylchloride (1.80 mL, 16.7 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and after 3 h, the reaction mixture was filtered, diluted with EtOAc (250 mL), washed with H2O (100 mL), brine (100 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Crystallization from toluene with a small amount of EtOAc provided 3.36 g (85%) of the title compound
