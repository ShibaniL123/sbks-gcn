1. Fieldof theInvention The present invention relates to methods for preparing crystalline (±)-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, and for preparing trans-(-)-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol or trans-(+)-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol from the resulting crystalline (±)-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol. 2. Background of the Invention (-)-6a,10a-Trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ("(-)-Δ9-THC") is mainly responsible for the antiemetic effects associated with cannabis (S.E. Sallen et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 302:135 (1980); A.E. Chang et al., Cancer 47:1746 (1981); and D.S. Poster et al., J. Am. Med. Asso. 245:2047 (1981)). Both trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, the trans-(-)- and (+)-enantiomers, respectively, of (±)-Δ9-THC, are reported to be useful for treating pain, with trans-(-)-Δ9-THC reported to be more potent than trans-(+)-Δ9-THC (see, e.g.,G. Jones et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 23:439 (1974); S.H. Roth, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 56:968 (1978); B.R. Martin et al., Life Sciences 29:565 (1981); M. Reichman et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 34:823 (1988); and M. Reichman et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 40:547 (1991)). trans-(-)-Δ9-THC is reported to be useful as antiemetic to relieve nausea and vomiting in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy and to stimulate weight gain in patients suffering from symptomatic HIV infection (seeU.S. Patent No. 6,703,418 B2 to Plasse). An encapsulated formulation of synthetic trans-(-)-Δ9-THC ("dronabinol") in sesame oil is currently sold as Marinol® by Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in 2.5, 5, and 10 mg dosage strengths. Trans-(-)-Δ9-THC can be extracted from hashish (see, Y. Gaoni et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 93:217 (1971); and U.S. Patent No. 6,365,416 B1 to Elsohly et al.). The concentration of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC in hashish, however, ranges from only about 1-5% depending on the source, and, even after extraction, trans-(-)-Δ9-THC must be separated from other impurities such as cannabinoid isomers. R.F. Turk et al., J. Pharm. Pharmac. 23:190-195 (1971) describes a method for isolating trans-(-)-Δ9-THC from marihuana, but the product contained an undetermined amount of carboxylic precursors of THC. The following paragraphs relate to known methods that purport making trans-(-)-Δ9-THC or (±)-Δ9-THC: U.S. Patent No. 3,560,528 to Petrizilka describes the reaction of (+)-p-mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol with olivetol in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate ("PTSA·H2O") or trifluoroacetic acid in refluxing benzene to provide (-)-Δ8-THC, which can be converted to trans-(-)-Δ9-THC by addition of HCl followed by dehydrochlorination (seeY. Mechoulam et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 89:4553 (1967); and R. Mechoulam et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 94:6159 (1972)).U.S. Patent No. 4,025,516 to Razdan et al. describes the reaction of a mixture of cis/trans-(+)-p-mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol with olivetol in an inert organic solvent in the presence of an excess of a non-alkaline dehydrating agent and an acid catalyst to form trans-(-)-Δ9-THC; this patent also describes the reaction of (-)-cannabidiol ("(-)-CBD") or (-)-abnormal-CBD ("(-)-abn-CBD") with a Lewis acid such as boron trifluoride diethylether ("BF3·Et2O") in an inert solvent under anhydrous conditions to form trans-(-)-Δ9-THC.R. K. Razdan et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 96:5860 (1974) describes the reaction of a mixture of cis/trans-(+)-p-mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol with olivetol in the presence of 1% BF3·Et2O, methylene chloride and anhydrous magnesium sulfate to form trans-(-)-Δ9-THC.U.S. Patent No. 4,381,399 to Olsen et al. describes a method for separating trans-(-)-Δ9-THC from a crude synthetic mixture, the method comprising esterifying the crude mixture, isolating the resultant trans-(-)-Δ9-THC ester, hydrolyzing the ester, and distilling trans-(-)-Δ9-THC at reduced pressure.K.E. Fahrenholtz et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 89:5934-5941 (1967) describes the hydrolysis of (±)-1-m-nitrobenzenesulfoanate-6a,10a-trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol with NaOH in aqueous methanol to provide (±)-Δ9-THC, which was subsequently crystallized from hexane.E.G. Taylor et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 88:367 (1966) describes the reaction of citral with olivetol in acidified ethanol to form (±)-Δ9-THC in about 35% yield.S. L. Levin et al., J. Chromatogr. A 654:53-64 (1993) describe a method for resolving trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC from a composition comprising equimolar amounts of the trans-(-)- and (+)-enantiomer.WO 2005/061480 describes a process for purifying trans-(-)-Δ9-THC which comprises at least one chromatographic step. Despite these described methods, there remains a need for improved methods for making trans-(-)-Δ9-THC in pure or substantially pure form. 3.

Without being limited by theory, Applicants believe that cannabinoid impurities typically present in Δ9-THC compositions are substantially, if not completely, removed when trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC are allowed to form crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC.

Crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC useful in this embodiment of the present invention is obtained by any method according to the first to tenth embodiment listed above. Saidmethod for obtaining crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC includes crystallization from a first composition comprising trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, and a non-polar organic solvent to provide crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC as described below in Section 4.3. Thus, in one embodiment, the invention relates to a method for preparing a trans-(-)-Δ9-THC composition, comprising: allowing a composition comprising (±)-Δ9-THC and an eluting solvent to separate on a chiral stationary phase to provide a trans-(-)-Δ9-THC composition comprising at least 98% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC;wherein the (±)-Δ9-THC was obtained by allowing trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC to crystallize from a first composition comprising trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, and a non-polar organic solvent to provide crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC and a liquid phase, wherein the first composition was obtained as described in the first to tenth embodiment of the methods for preparing crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC listed above. In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method for preparing a trans-(+)-Δ9-THC composition, comprising: allowing a composition comprising (±)-Δ9-THC and an eluting solvent to separate on a chiral stationary phase to provide a trans-(+)-Δ9-THC composition comprising at least 98% by weight of trans-(+)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of trans-(+)-Δ9-THC and trans-(-)-Δ9-THC;wherein the (±)-Δ9-THC was obtained by allowing trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC to crystallize from a first composition comprising trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, and a non-polar organic solvent to provide crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC and a liquid phase, wherein the first composition was obtained as described in the first to tenth embodiment of the methods for preparing crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC listed above. Compositions comprising trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC useful for obtaining crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC are obtained by methods described in Section 4.3. 4.3. The Crystallizing Step In the methods for making crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC according to the present invention, crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC is obtained by allowing trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC to crystallize from a composition comprising trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC and a non-polar organic solvent (the "Crystallizing Step") to provide crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC and a liquid phase. Compositions comprising trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC and a non-polar organic solvent useful for the Crystallizing Step are obtained using the steps preceding crystallization according to the methods of the first to tenth embodiment of the present invention listed above. For example, crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC can be obtained by contacting a suitable amount of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC with a non-polar organic solvent. The order and rate of addition of the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, the trans-(+)-Δ9-THC and the non-polar organic solvent is not critical and can be carried out sequentially or substantially simultaneously. As an example, trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, optionally in the presence of a non-polar organic solvent, and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, optionally in the presence of a non-polar organic solvent, can be added to a non-polar organic solvent. Likewise, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC in the presence of a non-polar organic solvent and trans-(-)-Δ9-THC in the presence of a non-polar organic solvent can be admixed. Trans-(-)-Δ9-THC can be obtained from natural products or by synthetic methods. Trans-(-)-Δ9-THC is obtainable from a natural product such as, e.g., hashish or marijuana (see Y. Gaoni et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 93:217 (1971); and U.S. Patent No. 6,365,416 B1 to Elsohly et al.). Trans-(-)-Δ9-THC can also be obtained by known synthetic methods. In embodiments according to the present invention, it is obtained by reaction of cis/trans mixture of (+)-p-mentha-2,8-dien-1-ol with olivetol in the presence of an acid catalyst such as para-toluenesulfonic acid and a dehydrating agent (seeU.S. Patent No. 3,560,528 to Petrizilka and U.S. Patent No. 4,025,516 to Razdan et al.); reaction of (-)-CBD with a Lewis acid such as BF3·Et2O in an inert solvent under anhydrous conditions (seeU.S. Patent No. 4,025,516 to Razdan et al.; and International publication no. WO 03/070506); or reaction of (-)-Δ8-THC with HCl followed by dehydrochlorination (seeY. Mechoulam et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 89:4553 (1967); and R. Mechoulam et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 94:6159 (1972)). Alternatively, trans-(-)-Δ9-THC can be obtained by methods described in Section 5. Trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, which is not known to occur in nature, can be made by known synthetic methods. In embodiments according to the present invention, it is obtained by reaction of (+)-Δ8-THC with HCl followed by dehydrochlorination (seeR. Mechoulam et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 94:6159 (1972). Alternatively, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC can be obtained by methods described in Section 5. In one embodiment, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC used in the Crystallizing Step is "recycled" from a previous resolution of (±)-Δ9-THC on a chiral stationary phase as described in Section 4.4. In another embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC used in the Crystallizing Step are obtained as a mixture of enantiomers by a direct synthetic method. When a synthetic method is used, the ratio of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC can vary depending on the optical purity of the reagents and the synthetic process. In one embodiment, trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC are obtained in equimolar amounts by a synthetic route using racemic reagents. Methods according to the present invention for preparing trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC by a direct synthetic route include reaction of citral and olivetol in the presence of a Lewis acid (seeR. Mechoulam et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 94:6159 (1972)). Alternatively, (±)-Δ9-THC can be obtained by methods described in Section 5. The ratio of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC used in the Crystallizing Step can vary. In one embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC is present in an amount from 0.75 to 1.25 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of trans-(+)-Δ9-THC. In another embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC is present in an amount from 0.9 to 1.1 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of trans-(+)-Δ9-THC. In another embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC is present in an amount from 0.95 to 1.05 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of trans-(+)-Δ9-THC. And in another embodiment, the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC is present in an amount of 1 molar equivalent per molar equivalent of trans-(+)-Δ9-THC. Examples of non-polar organic solvents that are useful in the Crystallizing Step include aliphatic (C4-C10)hydrocarbons such as butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, including straight-chained aliphatic hydrocarbons, branched aliphatic hydrocarbons and cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons, or any mixture thereof. In one embodiment, the non-polar organic solvent used in the Crystallizing Step is a straight-chain or branch-chain heptane. In another embodiment, the non-polar organic solvent used in the Crystallizing Step is pentane, hexane, heptane, octane or isooctane. In another embodiment, the non-polar organic solvent used in the Crystallizing Step is n-heptane. The amount of the non-polar organic solvent used in the Crystallizing Step can vary and will depend, in part, on the amount and type of cannabinoid impurities and temperature. Typically, the non-polar organic solvent is present in an amount sufficient to provide a mixture having a Δ9-THC concentration from 1 % to 95%, preferably from 20% to 75%, more preferably from 40% to 60% by weight based on the total amount of Δ9-THC and the non-polar organic solvent. The Crystallizing Step is carried out for a time and at a temperature sufficient to provide (±)-Δ9-THC crystals. A time sufficient to crystallize (±)-Δ9-THC is from 1 hour to 200 hours; in another embodiment, from 5 hours to 150 hours; in another embodiment, from 25 hours to 100 hours; and in another embodiment, from 30 hours to 75 hours. Typically, a temperature sufficient to provide crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC is from -78°C to 100°C; in another embodiment, from -50°C to 25°C; in another embodiment, from -30°C to 0°C; and in another embodiment, from -25°C to -15°C. In certain embodiments, the Crystallizing Step is carried out at two or more temperatures. In one embodiment, the composition comprising trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC and a non-polar organic solvent is prepared at a first temperature, e.g., 20°C or higher. Without being limited by theory, Applicants believe that forming the composition at a temperature of 20°C or higher increases the solubility of the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and the trans-(+)-Δ9-THC in the non-polar organic solvent. The temperature of the admixture can then be decreased to a second temperature, e.g., 0°C or lower. Without being limited by theory, Applicants believe that holding the admixture at a temperature of 0°C or lower decreases the solubility of (±)-Δ9-THC and promotes crystallization. Optionally, the temperature of the admixture can be further decreased to a third temperature, e.g., -20 to -15°C. As noted above, such a decrease in temperature is believed to enhance the (±)-Δ9-THC crystallization process. In one embodiment, trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC are dissolved in a non-polar organic solvent; the resultant solution is cooled to 0°C; the resultant mixture is further cooled to -15°C; and the resultant crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC is separated from the liquid phase. In another embodiment, the Crystallizing Step is carried out in the presence of a seed crystal. Typically, the seed crystal, when used, is added to the cold (e.g., 0°C or lower) admixture comprising trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC and the non-polar organic solvent. In one embodiment, the seed crystal is (±)-Δ9-THC. The progress of the Crystallizing Step can be monitored visually or using conventional analytical techniques, including thin-layer chromatography ("TLC"), high-performance liquid chromatography ("HPLC"), gas chromatography ("GC"), gas-liquid chromatography ("GLC"), infrared spectroscopy ("IR"), Raman spectroscopy ("Raman") and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ("NMR") such as 1H or 13C NMR. The Crystallizing Step can be carried out at reduced pressure, atmospheric pressure or elevated pressure. In one embodiment, the Crystallizing Step is carried out at atmospheric pressure. In the present invention, impurities are removed from the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and/or trans-(+)-Δ9-THC compositions prior to carrying out the Crystallizing Stepby extraction under basic conditions as described below. Therefore (±)-Δ9-THC is contacted with base prior to carrying out the Crystallizing Step. Thus, the methods according to the invention also encompass a method step for purifying trans-(±)-Δ9-THC (the "Δ9-THC Purification Method") comprising: contacting trans-(±)-Δ9-THC with a first water-immiscible organic solvent, a water-miscible alcohol, water, and an alkali metal hydroxide (the "Caustic Contacting Step") to form a biphasic mixture comprising (i) a first organic phase and (ii) an alcoholic-caustic phase comprising trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC. Without being limited by theory, it is believed that the Caustic Contacting Step extracts impurities from the Δ9-THC-containing alcoholic-caustic phase into the first organic phase, which impurities may impede or prevent (±)-Δ9-THC from crystallizing from the composition comprising the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, the trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, and the non-polar organic solvent. The amount of alkali metal hydroxide used in the Caustic Contacting Step typically ranges from 1 to 1000 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of Δ9-THC; in another embodiment, the amount of alkali metal hydroxide ranges from 10 to 100 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of trans-Δ9-THC; and in another embodiment, amount of alkali metal hydroxide ranges from 25 to 55 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of trans-Δ9-THC. Examples of water-miscible alcohols useful in the Caustic Contacting Step include methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, the water-miscible alcohol is methanol. The amount of water-miscible alcohol used in the Caustic Contacting Step typically is from 1 part to 100 parts by weight based on the weight of the alkali metal hydroxide; in another embodiment, the amount of water-miscible alcohol is from 1 part to 25 parts by weight based on the weight of the alkali metal hydroxide; and in another embodiment, the amount of water-miscible alcohol is from 5 parts to 10 parts by weight based on the weight of the alkali metal hydroxide. Examples of first water-immiscible organic solvents useful in the Caustic Contacting Step include the non-polar organic solvents described above for the Crystallizing Step. In one embodiment, the first water-immiscible solvent is heptane. The amount of first water-immiscible organic solvent used in the Caustic Contacting Step typically is from 1 part to 1000 parts by weight based on the weisht of the Δ9-THC; in another embodiment, the amount of water-immiscible organic solvent is from 5 parts to 100 parts by weight based on the weight of the Δ9-THC; and in another embodiment, the amount of water-immiscible organic solvent is from 5 parts to 20 parts by weight based on the weight of the Δ9-THC. The Caustic Contacting Step can be carried out by methods known in the art such as stirring, shaking, countercurrent cascade, ultrasound, admixing, pumping. The Caustic Contacting Step can also be carried out by methods useful for liquid-liquid extraction (see, e.g., Lo et al., Extraction, in 7 Kirk-Othmer Encyc. of Chem. Technol. 349-381 (4th ed. 1993)). The Caustic Contacting Step typically is carried out from 0.25 hours to 50 hours; in another embodiment, from 0.25 hours to 10 hours; and in another embodiment, from 0.25 hours to 2 hours. The Caustic Contacting Step is typically carried out at a temperature of from 0°C to 100 °C; in another embodiment, from 20°C to 50°C; and in another embodiment, from 20°C to 30°C. The Caustic Contacting Step can be carried out at reduced pressure, atmospheric pressure (i.e., 1 atmosphere), or elevated pressure. In one embodiment, the Caustic Contacting Step is carried out at atmospheric pressure. The progress of the Caustic Contacting Step can be monitored using conventional techniques as described above for the Crystallizing Step. In another embodiment, the trans-Δ9-THC Purification Method of the present invention further comprises contacting the alcoholic-caustic phase with an acid to provide an acid-treated alcoholic phase. Without being limited by theory, it is believed that trans-Δ9-THC is immiscible in the acidified alcoholic phase. Examples of useful acids include citric acid and acetic acid. In one embodiment, the acid is citric acid. Typically, the acid is added in an amount sufficient to achieve a pH of from 5 to 9. In another embodiment, the acid is added in an amount sufficient to achieve a pH from 6 to 8; in another embodiment, the acid is added in an amount sufficient to achieve a pH of from 7 to 8. In another embodiment, the Δ9-THC Purification Method of the present invention further comprises contacting the acid-treated alcoholic phase with a second water-immiscible organic solvent to form (i) a second organic phase comprising trans-(-)Δ9-THC and (ii) an acid-treated alcoholic phase. Examples of second water-immiscible organic solvents useful for contacting the acid-treated alcoholic phase to form a second organic phase comprising trans-Δ9-THC include the non-polar organic solvents described above for the Crystallizing Step. In one embodiment, the second water-immiscible organic solvent is heptane. The amount of first water-immiscible organic solvent used is typically is from 1 part to 1000 parts by weight based on the weight of the trans-Δ9-THC; in another embodiment, the amount of water-immiscible organic solvent is from 1 part to 50 parts by weight based on the weight of the trans-Δ9-THC; and in another embodiment, the amount of water-immiscible organic solvent is from 1 part to 10 parts by weight based on the weight of the trans-Δ9-THC. Methods useful for contacting the acid-treated alcoholic phase with a second water-immiscible organic solvent include those described above for the Caustic Contacting Step. In another embodiment, the Δ9-THC Purification Method of the present invention further comprises separating the second organic phase from the acid-treated alcoholic phase. Methods useful for separating the second organic phase from the acid-treated alcoholic phase include those described above for separating the first organic phase from the alcoholic-caustic phase. After separation from the acid-treated alcoholic phase, the second organic phase is typically dried by, e.g., azeotropic distillation and/or contacting the second organic phase with a drying agent (e.g., Na2SO4 or MgSO4). In another embodiment, the Δ9-THC Purification Method of the present invention further comprises concentrating the second organic phase to form a concentrated second organic phase comprising trans-Δ9-THC. A method useful for concentrating the second organic phase is distillation. When the second organic for phase is concentrated by distillation, the distillation can be carried out at elevated pressure, atmospheric pressure, or at reduced pressure. In one embodiment, the distillation is carried out at atmospheric pressure. In another embodiment, the distillation is carried out at reduced pressure. In another embodiment, the Δ9-THC Purification Method of the present invention further comprises contacting the concentrated second organic phase with a non-polar organic solvent to form a first organic composition comprising trans-Δ9-THC. The amount and type of non-polar organic solvent are those described above in the Crystallizing Step for the non-polar organic solvent. The trans-Δ9-THC used in the Δ9-THC Purification Method comprises trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC. In one embodiment, the trans-Δ9-THC used in the Δ9-THC Purification Method comprises trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, wherein the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC is present in an amount from 0.75 to 1.25 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of trans-(+)-Δ9-THC.

In another embodiment, the Δ9-THC Purification Method of the present invention further comprises allowing the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC to crystallize from the first organic composition to provide crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC as described above for the Crystallizing Step, wherein (a) the first organic composition comprises (-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, and (b) the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC is present in the first organic composition in an amount from 0.75 to 1.25 molar equivalents per molar equivalent of trans-(+)-Δ9-THC. In all embodiments, the invention relates to a method for making crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC comprising: allowing trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC to crystallize from a first composition comprising trans-(-)-Δ9-THC, trans-(+)-Δ9-THC, and a non-polar organic solvent to provide crystalline (+)-Δ9-THC,wherein the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and the trans-(+)-Δ9-THC were obtained by: (a) forming a biphasic composition comprising (i) a first organic phase comprising a first water-immiscible organic solvent, and (ii) an alcoholic-caustic phase containing trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC;(b) separating the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and the trans-(+)-Δ9-THC from the alcoholic-caustic phase; and(c) forming the first composition comprising (i) the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and the trans-(+)-Δ9-THC of step (b), and (ii) the non-polar organic solvent.

Similarly, methods for separating the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and the trans-(+)-Δ9-THC from the alcoholic-caustic phase, and methods for forming the first composition comprising (i) the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and the trans-(+)-Δ9-THC of step (b), and (ii) the non-polar organic solvent include those described above for the (±)-Δ9-THC Purification Method. Once obtained, crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC formed in the Crystallizing Step can be separated from the liquid phase by methods known in the art. Methods for separating the crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC from the liquid phase include, e.g., filtration, centrifugation and decantation. In one embodiment, crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC is separated from the liquid phase by filtration. Crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC formed in the Crystallizing Step can, optionally, be washed with an organic wash solvent, and separated from the liquid phase as described above. When crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC is washed, the temperature of the organic wash solvent can vary. Typically, the washing, when done, is carried out with an organic wash solvent at a temperature from -78°C to 50°C; in another embodiment, from -30°C to 30°C; and in another embodiment, from -20°C to 25°C. Examples of useful organic wash solvents include the non-polar organic solvents described above. In one embodiment, the organic wash solvent, when used, is n-heptane. The separated (±)-Δ9-THC can, optionally, be dried. The drying can be carried out at atmospheric pressure, optionally with the aid of a sweep gas such as dry air, nitrogen, helium, or argon. Alternatively, the (±)-Δ9-THC can be dried at reduced pressure. When the separated (±)-Δ9-THC is dried, the drying temperature can vary. Typically, the drying, when done, can be carried out at a temperature from -25° to 65°C; in another embodiment, from 0° to 60°C; and in another embodiment, from 25° to 50°C. Typically, the (±)-Δ9-THC obtained in the Crystallizing Step comprises at least 95% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids. In another embodiment, the (±)-Δ9-THC obtained in the Crystallizing Step comprises at least 98% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids. In another embodiment, the (+)-Δ9-THC obtained in the Crystallizing Step comprises at least 99% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids. The separated (±)-Δ9-THC can then be resolved on a chiral stationary phase as described below in Section 4.4. 4.4. The Resolving Step In the present invention, (±)-Δ9-THC obtained from crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC and an eluting solvent are contacted with a chiral stationary phase to resolve the trans-(-)- and (+)-enantiomers (the "Resolving Step"). This provides a composition comprising at least 98% by weight of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC or trans-(+)-Δ9-THC based on the total amount of cannabinoids. Without being limited by theory, Applicants believe that resolving (+)-Δ9-THC obtained from crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC provides a trans-(-)-Δ9-THC or trans-(+)-Δ9-THC composition having low levels, if any, of the cannabinoid impurities found in trans-(-)-Δ9-THC or trans-(+)-Δ9-THC obtained by known methods. The composition comprising (±)-Δ9-THC used in the Resolving Step can contain an amount of trans-(-)-Δ9-THC that is less than, equal to or greater than the amount of trans-(+)-Δ9-THC. For example, the composition comprising (±)-Δ9-THC may be obtained by admixing crystalline (±)-Δ9-THC with a trans-(-)-Δ9-THC composition and/or a trans-(+)-Δ9-THC prior to carrying out the Resolving Step. Typically, the composition comprising (±)-Δ9-THC contains an equimolar amount of the trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC. Any known or later-developed chiral stationary phase that resolves trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC can be used. For example, a method for resolving trans-(-)-Δ9-THC and trans-(+)-Δ9-THC enantiomers on a chiral stationary phase is described in S. L. Levin et al., J. Chromatogr. A 654:53-64 (1993). Typically, the chiral stationary phase contains a chiral group or derivative immobilized on a support such as, e.g., a polymer or inorganic oxide. An example of a useful polymer support is polystyrene in bead form. Examples of useful inorganic oxide supports include silica, magnesium silicate, magnesia, alumina and molecular sieves. In one embodiment, the inorganic oxide support is silica. The chiral derivative comprises at least one chiral center.

Francotte, J. Chromatogr. A 906:379-397 (2001)). Typically, a concentrated solution of (±)-Δ9-THC and an eluting solvent is added to the top (or front) of a column containing a chiral stationary phase. The (±)-Δ9-THC is then eluted with the eluting solvent (i.e., the mobile phase) to provide eluents containing trans-(-)-Δ9-THC or trans-(+)-Δ9-THC. The Resolving Step can be carried out using batch chromatography, continuous chromatography or simulated moving bed chromatography (see, e.g.,E.R. Francotte, J. Chromatogr. A 906:379-397 (2001)). In one embodiment, the Resolving Step is carried out using continuous chromatography. The Resolving Step can be carried out at 1 atmosphere of pressure or, optionally, at reduced pressure or elevated pressure. In one embodiment, the Resolving Step is carried out at 1 atmosphere of pressure. In another embodiment, the Resolving Step is carried out at elevated pressure.
