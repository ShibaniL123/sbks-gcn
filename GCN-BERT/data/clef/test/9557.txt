Step 3
The compound 3 (1.14 g, 3.12 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (5 mL). Tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride (1 mol/L tetrahydrofuran solution, 6.2 mL, 6.2 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 days. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica-gel column chromatography (chloroform-methanol) to give the compound 4 (828 mg, yield 100%).
