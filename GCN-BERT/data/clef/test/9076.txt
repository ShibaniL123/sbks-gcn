CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of German Application No. 10332011.3 filed Jul. 14, 2003, which is incorporated by reference herein. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to the use of glass compositions in the form of glass powders, fibers, granules, and spheres for achieving an antioxidative effect. The glass compositions according to the present invention may also be transformed into glass ceramics having a different degree of crystallinity by an annealing step and can be used as antioxidants. Also a complete transformation into a ceramic may be carried out. With it, the glass composition may be used in a versatile manner, such as in cosmetic products (i.a. “anti-aging” products), medical products, edibles and animal food, paints and lacquers, and in polymers. In this case on the one hand, the employment of the materials described herein may occur for protecting the product itself, but on the other hand also for achieving an antioxidative effect towards outside (e.g. in food additives). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION While the use of antimicrobially and/or biocidally acting glasses is known from a plurality of documents, the employment of glass compositions to stop or retard an oxidation reaction has completely been unknown so far. By the use of antioxidants; oxidation reactions which have a negative effect on various products may be stopped retarded; or respectively. Thus, for example, the presence of free radicals in the above mentioned products may result in undesired decomposition, discoloration or even in the complete uselessness of the product. Thus the antioxidants may also have product preservative or even product maintaining properties. Oxidation effects i.a. are also responsible for the aging of the skin. These oxidations, respectively the formation of radicals are caused i.a. by UV radiation of the sun light also by pollutants in the air, and respectively. These effects are i.a. also responsible for the formation of wrinkles. Items antioxidants are also utilized in cosmetic products which should take precautions against a premature aging of the skin (so-called anti wrinkle agents). The antioxidants described and known so far are almost exclusively organic compounds. Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and also vitamin E inter alia are well known to a person skilled in the art. Partly these compounds have the disadvantage not to be photo resistant by itself, i.e. that they may act as a free-radical generator. The known oxidant vitamin C i.a. suffers from this disadvantage, in particular when applied in small concentrations. Thus there is a need for providing an antioxidant which may be used for the above mentioned applications and which doesn't suffer from the disadvantages of the known antioxidants. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It was surprisingly now found that glass compositions as defined in the claims may be used for the purpose of avoiding oxidation reactions, i.e. as antioxidant. The glass compositions may be oxidic. The antioxidative compositions of the present invention have a high photo and temperature stability. Preferably the antioxidative glass compositions have a biocidal effect on bacteria, fungi and viruses or they are biostatic. Further preferably in contact with humans they are non-irritant to skin and even edible, in addition toxicologically harmless and environmentally compatible. Thus the compositions are preferably free of heavy metals, in particular when they are in direct contact with living beings. The glass compositions used in this case comprise glass ceramics, fibers, granules, spheres and glass powders. A glass powder may be a powder that contains a plurality of glass particles in any form (also fibers), for example glass spheres having a particle size (d50) of smaller than 1 mm up to smaller than 500 μm, more preferably <100 μm and <20 ppm, in particular <10 μm and <5 μm, or glass fibers having a diameter of smaller than 1 mm up to smaller than 500 μm, more preferably <100 μm and <20 μm, in particular <10 μm and <5 μm. Glass ceramics according to the present invention may be prepared by annealing and may have different degrees of crystallinity. The antioxidative effect may be based on a reaction of the glass with surrounding substances. Reactions on the glass surface may also contribute to the antioxidative effect. Presumably the compositions produce the antioxidative effect in different manners, for example by the interception of free radicals, but also by the discontinuation of reaction chains which are responsible for the formation of free radicals and/or oxidation reactions and/or the exertion of an effect of chelation. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows the hydroxyl radical inhibiting effect of embodiment 3 in dependence on the concentration; and FIGS. 2-3 show the measure of the antioxidative effect on the basis of obtained and oxidized proteins. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION According to the following embodiment examples which serve for illustration the invention will be described in more detail: EXAMPLE 1 Glasses were smelted from the raw materials shown in table 1 which afterwards were formed into ribbons. By means of dry milling these ribbons were further processed into powder having a particle size of d50=4 μm.

The diagram of FIG. 1. shows the hydroxyl radical inhibiting effect of embodiment 3 in dependence on the concentration. FIG. 1 shows that embodiment 3 produces a clear hydroxyl radical inhibiting effect which increases with rising concentration. It is possible to show that the antioxidative effect may be based on a discontinuation of the redox reaction chain. In the test method described herein the effect is based on a chelate formation (complexation) of iron which is required for the formation reaction of the free radicals. Thus the Fe(2+)/Fe(3+) redox reaction will be discontinued. EXAMPLE 2 An alternative test method for detecting the antioxidative effect may be carried out by means of the so-called “Protein-Carbonyl-Assay-Test” which is described in “R. L. Levine et al., Meth. Enzymol. 186, 464-478, 1990”. FIGS. 2 and 3 show the measure of the antioxidative effect on the basis of obtained and oxidized proteins. The test was carried out, before the irradiation with UV light (−UV) and after the action of UV light (+UV). The lower the bar in FIG. 3, the higher the antioxidative effect for the composition in each case. The bar diagram of FIG. 3 shows that with embodiment 2 only few oxidized proteins were obtained, i.e. that the antioxidative effect was high. Embodiment 3 also shows a clear antioxidative effect after UV irradiation.
