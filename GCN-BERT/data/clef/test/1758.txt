CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/784,021, filed on Apr. 5, 2007 and issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8,852,149, which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/789,817, filed on Apr. 6, 2006. The disclosures of these prior applications are incorporated by reference in their entirety. BACKGROUND The present invention generally relates to an appliance and methods that may be used to provide instruction in how to use a medical device to provide medical treatment to a person. More specifically, the present invention is comprised of an appliance that integrates the medical device with other hardware and software that may be used to provide a medical practitioner using the medical device with information regarding the use and operation of the medical device. As medical technology continues to advance, new medical devices are continually becoming available for use by healthcare practitioners. Because of the relatively large number of these new devices, healthcare practitioners may have difficulty in retaining knowledge regarding the use of the devices. If a healthcare practitioner is unfamiliar with a medical device, patient safety may be compromised if the practitioner is unable to complete, or incorrectly completes, a course of treatment because he or she fails to have adequate knowledge of use of the device. Keeping apprised of the proper use of new medical devices, however, represents a number of challenges. For example, it is typically difficult for busy healthcare practitioners to find time to read an instruction manual for a medical device. This means of instruction is also inefficient for many people who tend to be more visually oriented. Where a hands-on approach to learning is more efficient, it is often necessary to attend a class or have personal instruction in how to use the device. This may be difficult because of time constraints or scheduling problems. Even if the healthcare practitioner has received instruction in the use of a medical device, problems may arise if significant time has elapsed since the last use of the device. For example, the practitioner may find himself or herself in a position of suddenly realizing that crucial information has been forgotten in the midst of providing treatment using the device. There may be no convenient way to reacquire this missing information, so that patient safety may be compromised as a result. There is therefore a need for a system that provides efficient instruction regarding the use and operation of medical devices to perform their intended medical treatment. Preferably, this system provides a hands-on approach to learning without the need for a separate training class or personal instruction. The system should also provide ready access to instruction while using the medical device, so that instruction may be readily obtained while the device is in use. Finally, the system should allow the practitioner quick and easy access to the portion of the instructional materials that are necessary. SUMMARY The present invention is directed to an appliance and methods that satisfy the needs described above. As described in greater detail below, they have many advantages over existing instructional apparatus and methods when used for their intended purpose, as well as novel features that result in a new instructional appliance and methods that are not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art apparatus or methods, either alone or in any combination thereof. In accordance with the present invention, an appliance is provided for administering medical treatment to a person, in which the appliance also provides ready and convenient access to instruction in the use of the appliance in a manner that overcomes the disadvantages of currently existing apparatus. In one embodiment of the present invention, the appliance is comprised of a medical device, a electronic processor, and display means, which are described in more detail below. The medical device is generally adapted to provide the desired medical treatment to the person. The electronic processor is positioned on or within the medical device, and is adapted so that video content relating to use and operation of the medical device is digitally stored within the electronic processor. The display means, which are described in more detail below, visually display the video content digitally stored within the electronic processor. The display means are also positioned on a surface of the medical device, and are electronically connected to the electronic processor. The display means are capable of displaying the video content so that the user of the appliance has access to video information regarding use and operation of the medical device. As a result, the appliance of the present invention meets the needs described above in the Background section. For example, the appliance provides efficient instruction regarding the use and operation of the medical device in performing its intended medical treatment. The video content digitally stored in the electronic processor contains this information. The video content is also typically indexed so that different portions of the stored instructional information may be accessed as desired by the healthcare practitioner. Because the appliance generally provides video instruction, it overcomes the monotony and frustration associated with merely reading an instruction manual. The appliance also provides a hands-on approach to learning without the need for a separate training class or personal instruction. Because the medical device is integrated as a part of the appliance, the appliance provides ready access to instruction while using the medical device. Thus, the practitioner may readily obtain instruction even while using the medical device to provide medical treatment. This may enhance patient safety where instructional information becomes necessary during the course of the treatment. It is to be noted that almost any medical device may be used as a part of the appliance, as long as its physical dimensions and complexity allow for and warrant use of the instructional system encompassed within the appliance. In some embodiments of the present invention, the display means are comprised of a liquid crystal display. In other embodiments, the appliance is further comprised of electronic control means for electronically controlling the operation of the electronic processor, and the liquid crystal display is comprised of a touch-screen liquid crystal display that is adapted to comprise the electronic control means.

The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of the description and should not be regarded as limiting. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The foregoing summary, as well as the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, will be better understood when read in conjunction with the appended drawings, in which: FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an embodiment of an appliance comprising the present invention; and FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram of the embodiment of the appliance illustrated in FIG. 1, in which the components of the appliance other than those related to the particular medical device are illustrated. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In accordance with the present invention, an appliance and methods for using the appliance are provided for administering medical treatment to a person. The word “person” is to be broadly construed and may encompass animals as well as humans. Although the description of the present invention set forth herein is directed primarily toward use of the appliance and methods for treatment of wounds and other infirmities on a portion of a person's body, the term “medical treatment,” as used herein, may also include any other type of treatment or activity conducted for purposes of examination, diagnosis, treatment, cure or relief of any disease, condition or malady, or for other purposes related to the health and well being of the person. Such uses are encompassed within the scope of the present invention to the extent they are included within the scope of the appended claims. An embodiment of an appliance 10 of the invention is illustrated in perspective view in FIG. 1. A schematic diagram of the appliance 10 of FIG. 1 is set forth in FIG. 2, in which the components of the appliance 10 other than those related to the particular medical device 20 utilized as a part of the appliance 10 are illustrated. It is to be noted that the various components comprising the medical device 20 are dependent upon the type of medical device 20 incorporated as a part of the appliance 10, and are not relevant to the present invention, as described in more detail below. In this embodiment, the appliance 10 is generally comprised of a medical device 20, an electronic processor 30 (illustrated schematically in FIG. 2), display means 40 (illustrated schematically in FIG. 2, and as a liquid crystal display 41 in FIG. 1, which are described in more detail below), audio output means 50 (illustrated schematically in FIG. 2, and as a piezoelectric device 51 in FIG. 1, which are described in more detail below), electronic input means 60 (illustrated schematically in FIG. 2, and as a DVD drive 61 and a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port 65 in FIG. 1, which are described in more detail below), an electronic storage device 70 (illustrated schematically in FIG. 2, and as a DVD 71 and a flash storage device 75 in FIG. 1, which are described in more detail below), and electronic control means 80 (illustrated schematically in FIG. 2, and described in more detail below). The medical device 20 is adapted to provide medical treatment to a person (not illustrated). In the illustrated embodiment, the medical device 20 is a medical grade vacuum pump 21 that acts as a source of negative pressure for purposes of negative pressure wound therapy. This type of vacuum pump and its use for purposes of negative pressure wound therapy are described in more detail in U.S. Pat. No. 7,128,735, issued to Richard Scott Weston, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Generally, the vacuum pump 21 is further comprised of a vacuum gauge 22 to measure negative pressure produced by the vacuum pump 21, an on/off switch 23 for vacuum pump 21 operation, and a knob 24 for control of the negative pressure level to be created by the vacuum pump 21. A connector 25 is used to connect the vacuum pump 21 to one end of a length of flexible tubing (not illustrated and not material for purposes of this disclosure), which is connected at its other end to a wound dressing (not illustrated and not material for purposes of this disclosure). It is to be noted that in other embodiments of the present invention the medical device 20 may be comprised of almost any type of medical device currently known in the relevant art or that may be developed in the relevant art in the future, as long as the medical device 20 has physical dimensions adequate to house the remaining components comprising the appliance 10 and the complexity of use and operation of the medical device 20 is such that instruction in such use and operation may be desirable. When the user of the appliance 10 desires to receive instruction in the use and operation of the medical device 20, he or she manipulates the electronic control means 80 (as described in more detail below), designating the training materials he or she desires to observe. The video and audio content comprising the training materials are digitally stored within data storage media comprising the electronic processor 30 (as described in more detail below) or on one or more electronic storage devices 70, 71, 75 (as described in more detail below). The electronic processor 30 also controls the operation of the display means 40, 41, the audio output means 50, 51, and the electronic input means 60, 61, 65, all of which are described in more detail below. When electronically directed by the electronic control means 80, the electronic processor 30 calls for and receives the video and audio content that is digitally stored within the data storage media comprising the electronic processor 30 (as described in more detail below) or received from the electronic storage device 70, 71, 75 through the electronic input means 60, 61, 65 (as described in more detail below). The electronic processor 30 then transmits the selected video content to the display means 40, 41, and the selected audio content to the audio output means 50, 51. The user of the appliance 10 is then able to visually observe the video content, as it is displayed on the display means 40, 41, and to hear audio content, as it is broadcast from the audio output means 50, 51. It is to be noted that the “video content” and “audio content” comprising the training materials, as such terms are used herein, are typically coordinated so that the audio content accompanies the video content, as would be the case in viewing a full-motion video of a person describing how to use a feature of the medical device 20. In some embodiments, however, there may be reasons for including separate video or audio content, such as an audible alarm where the audio output means 50, 51 are also used as a part of the medical device 20, or a visual chart where the display means 40, 41 are also used to display information (such as negative pressure levels over time) related to operation of the medical device 20. Further, the training materials may take any suitable form that may be useful for providing instruction in the use and operation of the medical device 20, such as full-motion video, static photographs, slides, charts, graphs, graphics, drawings, depictions, plans, specifications, or other types of related information or combinations thereof. The electronic processor 30 of the appliance 10 is illustrated schematically in FIG. 2. The electronic processor 30 is not illustrated in FIG. 1, however, because it is positioned within the casing of the vacuum pump 21. In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 1, all of the functions of the electronic processor 30 are performed by a single electronic processor 30. In other embodiments of the invention, however, the various processor-related functions of the electronic processor 30 may be performed by separate electronic processors or combinations of electronic processors. The preferred number of electronic processors comprising the electronic processor 30 depends upon the function or functions to be performed by the electronic processor 30. For example, the electronic processor 30 may be comprised of multiple processors where multiple types of electronic input means 60 are provided. Generally, and referring again to the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 as an example, the electronic processor 30 may be comprised of one or more integrated circuits, printed circuits, and hybrid circuits or any combination of such circuits currently known in the relevant art or developed in the relevant art in the future. In addition, passive and active circuit components may be used in conjunction with one or more of such circuits where the functions to be performed by the electronic processor 30 require such components. Such circuits may be constructed of a rigid, semi-rigid, or flexible substrate material. The type of electronic processor 30 is generally dependent upon the type of display means 40, 41, the type of electronic input means 60, 61, 65, the type of audio output means 50, 51, the type of electronic storage device 70, 71, 75, and the type of electronic control means 80 to be utilized in the appliance 10. For example, the electronic processor 62 includes circuits necessary to electronically operate the display means 40. In the illustrated embodiment of the appliance 10, the electronic processor 30 may include a driver circuit, which is used to develop the voltages appropriate to activate and deactivate the pixels of display means 40 comprised of a liquid crystal display (LCD) 41. The electronic processor 30 may also include a polarity switcher at the output of the driver circuit that selects whether the row or column electrode of the LCD display 41 is to receive the positive polarity, while a row/column selector switch determines which specific row/column pair of the LCD display 41 receives the voltages produced by the polarity switch and the driver circuit. In some embodiments of the invention, the electronic processor 30 may also comprise one or more additional electronic data storage media (not illustrated), which may be comprised of almost any portable data storage media currently known in the relevant art or that may be developed in the relevant art in the future. For example, such data storage media may include one or more additional memory boards or integrated circuits or a part of the integrated circuit or circuits comprising the electronic processor 30. Alternatively, such electronic data storage media may also include one or more of each of the following devices in electronic communication with the circuits comprising the electronic processor 30: optical storage device (such as compact disc, digital versatile disc (sometimes also referred to as digital video disc or “DVD”), hard drive device, flash memory data storage device, or combinations of such devices. The preferred data storage media is dependent upon the types of devices comprising the remaining portions of the appliance 10 (without considering the medical device 20), as well as the type and quantity of audio content and video content to be utilized by the appliance 10. The more preferred data storage media is a hard drive device or flash memory data storage device. The electronic processor 30 may also be adapted to receive information from the medical device 20 in a compatible digital form so that such information may be displayed on the display means 40, 41 or broadcast by the audio output means 50, 51. Such information may include medical device 20 operating parameters (such as periodic pressure level measurements), alarm notifications (such as a low vacuum alarm signal), and other information related to the use, operation and function of the medical device 20. Preferably, the electronic processor 30 is a modular integrated circuit or combination of integrated circuits, including suitable data storage media, adapted to perform the functions desired of the appliance 10. These functions generally include: (a) electronically interacting with the electronic storage device 70, 71, 75 through the electronic input means 60, 61, 65; (b) receiving, recording, storing, and processing the digital audio content and video content; (c) electronically interacting with the electronic control means 80 to receive electronic instructions from the user; and (d) electronically interacting with the display means 40, 41 to display the video content and with the audio output means 50, 51 to broadcast the audio content. Examples of electronic processors suitable for use as the electronic processor 30 are well known in the relevant art. The electronic processor 30 may be included as a part of a circuit board (not illustrated) that comprises the medical device 20 (vacuum pump 21). Alternatively, the electronic processor 30 may be positioned in any suitable area within the casing of the vacuum pump 21, may be incorporated as a part of any suitable component (not illustrated) comprising the vacuum pump 21, or may be wholly or partially embedded in or attached to the casing of the vacuum pump 21. The electronic processor 30, the display means 40, 41, the audio output means 50, 51, and the electronic input means 60, 61, 65, are provided with electrical energy required for their operation by a power supply 26. Preferably, the power supply 26 is the same power supply unit that powers the medical device 20, so that a separate power supply 26 dedicated solely to the electronic processor 30 is not necessary. In such cases, the power supply 26 may typically be a battery (not illustrated) or an external source of power, such as electricity supplied by a standard 120 volt, 60 Hz AC outlet (not illustrated). Additional electronic circuitry and components (such as transformers or converters) may be required to step-up or step-down the electrical current supplied by the power supply 26 for use by the electronic processor 30 and the components of the appliance 10 that it controls. Where a separate, dedicated power supply 26 is necessary, the power supply 26 may be comprised of one or more of almost any compact, portable source of electrical energy known in the relevant art or developed in the relevant art in the future, such as a battery. In other embodiments of the invention, the power supply 26 may also be comprised of one or more devices that are used to collect solar or other electromagnetic energy and convert such energy to a form appropriate for powering the electronic processor 30 and the components of the appliance 10 that it controls. For example, the power supply 26 may be comprised of one or more photoelectric cells fabricated from a silicon compound. The type of power supply 26 to be used in any particular embodiment of the appliance 10 is dependent upon the anticipated use of the appliance 10 and the individual preference of the user of the appliance 10. Preferably, the power supply 26 is a re-chargeable lithium-ion battery that is rechargeable by connecting it to a standard 120 volt, 60 Hz AC outlet. The power supply 26 is electronically connected to the electronic processor 30 by one or more circuit elements 29 (illustrated schematically in FIG. 2, but not illustrated in FIG. 1), as described in more detail below. Some embodiments of the appliance 10 may also include power reduction means (not illustrated) to decrease the consumption of electrical power by the components of the appliance 10 other than the medical device 20. An example of such means is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,931,764 to Viztec, Inc., which is incorporated herein by reference. Other embodiments may also include means to recharge the power supply 26, such as the use of direct electrical contacts, RF signals, inductive, solar-galvanostatic, potentiostatic, and other charging means currently known in the relevant art or developed in the relevant art in the future. To accomplish such charging, the power supply 26 or the electronic processor 30 may include a regulator control circuit that accepts current and voltage from an external power source for storage in the power supply 26. An example of such means is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,931,764 to Viztec, Inc., which is incorporated herein by reference. In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the appliance 10 further comprises electronic control means 80, which enable the user of the appliance 10 to control or provide other input regarding the various functions performed by the electronic processor 30. For example, in the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the appliance 10 generally has an on/off switch 27, which is comprised of a standard toggle-type of electrical switch, and is used to turn the electronic processor 30 on and off. In addition, the appliance includes a knob 28, which may be used to select various portions of the video content and audio content available for display on the display means 40, 41 and broadcast over the audio output means 50, 51. Other embodiments of the invention may also comprise other electronic control means 80, which may include any suitable means that are currently known in the relevant art or that may be developed in the relevant art in the future to provide data or control input in electronic form. Examples of such means include rheostats, potentiometers, switches, relays, touch screen LCD's, and other input means, and combinations of the foregoing. Another example is a voice activated electronic control means 80. For example, where the audio output means 50, 51 is comprised of a piezoelectric device 51 that may act as both a speaker and a microphone, the piezoelectric device 51 may be used to receive voice commands from the user of the appliance 10 and convert those commands to digital signals that are electronically transferred to the electronic processor 30. The electronic processor 30 may then convert the digital signals to electronic commands that govern the operation of the electronic processor 30, allowing for hands-free operation of the informational aspect of the appliance 10. The electronic control means 80 are electronically connected to the electronic processor by one or more circuit elements, as described in more detail below. For example, in the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the switch 27 and the knob 28 are connected to the electronic processor 30 by insulated copper wires 81 (illustrated schematically in FIG. 2, but not illustrated in FIG. 1). In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the appliance 10 is also comprised of electronic input means 60 (illustrated as DVD drive 61 and USB port 65 in FIG. 1, and schematically as “Input Port” in FIG. 2), and electronic storage devices (illustrated as DVD 71 and flash storage device 75 in FIG. 1, and schematically as “Storage Device” in FIG. 2). Generally, each electronic storage device 70, 71, 75 digitally stores audio content and video content comprising the training materials and corresponds to a compatible electronic input means 60, 61, 65, respectively. For example, the electronic input receptacle DVD drive 61 is used with the DVD 71 and the flash storage device 75 is used with the electronic input receptacle USB port 65. It is to be noted that the audio content and video content comprising the training materials may be stored on more than one electronic storage device 70, 71, 75. The DVD drive 61 and the USB port 65, as well as their corresponding DVD 71 and flash storage device 75, respectively, are well known in the art. In other embodiments of the invention, the electronic storage devices 70, 71, 75 and their corresponding compatible electronic input means 60, 61, 65 may be comprised of any suitable means currently known in the relevant art (such as floppy discs and compact discs) or developed in the relevant art in the future that may be used for storing electronic data in digital form. More than one type of electronic storage device 70, 71, 75 and corresponding compatible electronic input means 60, 61, 65 may be used with any particular embodiment of the appliance 10. The preferred type and number of electronic storage devices 70, 71, 75 and corresponding compatible electronic input means 60, 61, 65 to be utilized in any particular embodiment of the appliance 10 is dependent upon the size and complexity of the medical device 20, the type and quantity of audio content and video content involved, the preference of the user of the appliance 10, and other factors. Further, the electronic input means 60, 61, 65 may be placed in any suitable position on the surface of the medical device 20. The electronic input means 60, 61, 65 are electronically connected to the electronic processor 30 by one or more circuit elements, as described in more detail below. For example, in the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the electronic input means 60, 61, 65 are connected to the electronic processor 30 by insulated copper wires 69 (illustrated schematically in FIG. 2, but not illustrated in FIG. 1). In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the appliance 10 is comprised of display means 40, 41, which receive data and information (as video content) from the electronic processor 30 and optically display such data and information in a format that may be observed from above the surface of the appliance 10. In other embodiments of the invention, the appliance 10 may have two or more electronic displays 41 comprising the display means 40. The number of electronic displays 41 is generally dependent upon the physical shape and configuration of the appliance 10, the position of the user of the appliance 10 while the appliance 10 is in use, the preferences of the user of the appliance 10, and other factors. Preferably, a single electronic display 41 displays all data and information comprising the video content supplied by the electronic processor 30. The electronic display 41 is electronically connected to the electronic processor 30 by one or more circuit elements 42 (illustrated schematically in FIG. 2, but not illustrated in FIG. 1), as described in more detail below. In the embodiments of the invention illustrated in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the display means 40, 41 are comprised of an LCD display. In other embodiments of the invention, the display means 40, 41 may be comprised of any suitable type of miniature, portable display device currently known in the relevant art or developed in the relevant art in the future that is capable of receiving data and information from the one or more electronic processors and displaying such data and information in a format that may be optically observed. For example, the display means 40, 41 may be comprised of LED, plasma, electronic papers (e.g., GYRICON, choleteric nematic phase transition, and IRIDIGM), and similar types of displays. The type of display means 40, 41 is dependent upon the preferences of the user of the appliance 10, the functions to be performed by the appliance 10, the video content to be displayed by the display means 40, 41, the expected use of the appliance 10, and other factors. It is to be noted that more than one type of display means 40, 41 may be used in the various embodiments of the invention. It is also to be noted that the display means 40, 41 may be of almost any shape currently known in the relevant art or developed in the relevant art in the future. For example, the electronic display 41 of the appliance 10 illustrated in FIG. 1 is generally rectangular in shape. In addition, in various embodiments of the invention, the display means 40, 41 may display data and information in any format desired by the user of the appliance 10.
