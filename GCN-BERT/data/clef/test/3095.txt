FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to the application of silicon dioxide aerogel and specifically relates to the application of silicon dioxide aerogel as a nano-drug carrying system in pharmacy. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION With the extensive application of combinatorial chemistry and a high-throughput screening technology in research and development of new drugs, the development speed of new compound entities is becoming faster and faster. However, according to statistics, in many new compound entities with physiological activity, hydrophobic compounds become more and more, the proportion is as high as about 40%, and the proportion of chemically synthesized candidate compounds is as high as 60%. It is worth mentioning that, in the development stage, up to 40%-70% of the compounds cannot produce a sufficient curative effect due to insufficient solubility. Thus, the research and development of brand new drugs has the characteristics of long period, high input and high risk. If many candidate compounds are difficult to be orally absorbed or less liable to being directly prepared into injections due to the problem of solubility, the stop or (and) termination of the development is caused, thereby inevitably leading to huge economic loss and waste of resources. Statistical data show that the lag of pharmaceutical preparation technologies seriously impedes the development of new drugs. Some major drug species with a very high market share, such as paclitaxel (with annual sales of more than 10 billion dollars), insulin and the like, only have the dosage form of injections and have relatively high toxicity and side effects, while the oral preparations and other dosage forms which have better anticipated effects and are very expected in the market have not been developed successfully till now. Taking the solubility of the drug as an example, due to the defect of poor water solubility, about 40% of the candidate drugs cannot be marketed, and there has not been any breakthrough progress in solving the problem of solubility. It is estimated that about 65 billion dollars of the drugs lead to a serious imbalance between the proportion of the treatment cost and the curative effect due to poor bioavailability every year around the world. However, many hardly soluble drugs have a very strong bioactivity actually and thus have a good curative effect in the treatment of tumors, cardiovascular diseases and the like. Thus, how to improve the solubility and absorptivity of the drugs also becomes the hotspot and the difficult point in the research of pharmacy, and it is urgent to develop a new preparation technology and the dosage form to solve the problem. The appearance of a nano-technology provides broad prospects for the development of biological medicines. In recent decades, various nano-drug delivery systems, such as nanoemulsions, lipid nanoparticles, nanomicelles, nanogels, nanocrystals, albumin nanoparticles and the like, emerged one after another. A nanoparticle drug delivery system provides a new carrier for delivering the hardly soluble drug, so that the water solubility of the drug can be increased, the dispersivity is improved, the advantages of improving oral absorption and bioavailability of the drug and strengthening targeting property and the like of the drug are realized, and the curative effect of the drug is further improved; meanwhile, the system can reduce toxicity and side effects caused by high distribution of a solubilizing agent, a cosolvent and other excipients and a non-target area; and furthermore, the system can also enable the water-soluble drug, such as an injection drug delivery preparation of macromolecular polypeptide and protein, to be long-acting, improve the stability and realize the advantages of small irritation, low toxicity and side effects and the like. In the international pharmaceutical field, anti-tumor drugs have been invented for decades and “novel drugs for drug-carrying system” have been started for decades. Due to the continuous use of traditional pharmaceutical excipients, the purposes of low toxicity and high efficiency are not achieved. Thus, only few injection type modified drugs, such as liposome type drugs for injection, albumin paclitaxel and the like, appeared in the past many years, while oral anti-tumor first-line drugs, in particular cytotoxic drugs, are still absent. At present, although research reports about the nanoparticles are not few, the problem of low oral bioavailability of the anti-tumor drugs cannot be fundamentally solved. After oral administration, a large part of nanoparticles cannot be absorbed and are discharged out of a human body, and only a small part of the nanoparticles are absorbed. If the drug absorption fluctuates at a low level, the error in percentage of the absorption dose will be significant. As for a given dose, if the intake of microparticles exceeds a predicted value, the toxicity will be produced; and if the absorption amount is relatively small or the concentration of the drug is lower than the treatment dose range, treatment failure will be caused. In the aspect of technical indexes, the studies made by people in many years have proved that the structure at a nanosize of 10-100 nm is most conductive to absorption of the drug in the human body (human capillaries are at the micron-size), but in the aspect of pharmaceutical excipients, all the current legal pharmaceutical excipients do not achieve the standard (see Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients). In the current hot studies of the “nano-drugs”, some researchers use various methods to prepare the nano-drugs and nano-liposomes and the like, but in some drugs, the physical scale can only achieve the micron-size (the scale above 100 nm cannot be considered as the nano-size in material science), and the drug carrying rate and the encapsulation rate required for realizing the medicinal effect cannot be met to a greater extent. Aerogel generally refers to a nano-porous network structure constituted by mutual aggregation of nanosized ultramicroparticles, and a lightweight nano-solid material of a gas-state dispersion medium is filled in network holes. The aerogel is a solid, but 90% of the aerogel is constituted by gas, and the appearance seems like cloud. Sometimes, the aerogel is also called as “solid smoke” or “blue smoke” due to translucent color and ultralight weight. The most common aerogel is silicon dioxide aerogel, and the silicon dioxide aerogel is a lightweight nano-porous amorphous solid material with very excellent heat protection and heat insulation performances and draws universal attention of people in the fields of heat insulation, heat preservation, biosensors, catalytic and optical materials and the like. But the precedent of applying the silicon dioxide aerogel in the field of pharmacy as the nano-drug carrying system has not been found up to now. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Through studies, the inventor found that silicon dioxide aerogel has not only a particle size scale of less than 100 nm, which is strictly defined in material science, but also an independent spatial structure of less than 100 nm, each millimeter of thickness achieves 10000 layers of nanoholes, the spatial (air) volume for carrying a drug is above 90%, and the highest drug carrying rate in the history can be achieved. The silicon dioxide aerogel owns huge specific surface area and stable nano-aperture which are necessary for improving the bioavailability of drugs, and can be used for performing nano-dispersion on various types of drugs by “self-assembly”, “cross-linking” and other ways so as to form independent “nano-dispersions” which cannot be aggregated with the carried drugs, realize the “nano-drugs” and the “nanocrystallization” of the various drugs with universality in a real sense and directly solve the international difficult problems that the drugs cannot be formed due to aggregation in the studies of micronano-drugs, hardly soluble drugs are very difficult to improve the bioavailability and the like in the science of preparations. Through further studies, the inventor further discovered that by applying the silicon dioxide aerogel to the field of pharmacy, the effects of greatly improving the bioavailability of the drugs and reducing the toxicity and the side effects are realized for a variety of dosage forms, and the excellent performances are also shown in solid dispersion, sustained release, controlled release and the like. The silicon dioxide aerogel surpasses all the existing pharmaceutical excipients at home and abroad due to huge specific surface area, unprecedented drug carrying rate, high biological safety and excellent biocompatibility and biological inertia, and can be applied to chemical drugs, protein and polypeptide drugs and natural drugs, and can be applied to water-soluble, alcohol-soluble, lipid-soluble and other dosage forms. The invention aims at providing a new application of silicon dioxide aerogel. The new application of the silicon dioxide aerogel provided by the invention refers to the application of the silicon dioxide aerogel as a nano-drug carrying system in pharmacy, wherein the nano-drug carrying system refers to a nanoparticle drug carrying system with the diameter of less than 100 nm, which is formed in the form of adsorbing a carried drug in the holes of the silicon dioxide aerogel, and the silicon dioxide aerogel has the porosity of 95-99%, the aperture of 10-50 nm, the specific surface area of 200-1000 m2/g, the density of 3-300 kg/m3 and the diameter of colloidal particles constituting a network of 1-50 nm. Further, the application refers to the application of the silicon dioxide aerogel as the nano-drug carrying system in the preparation of oral preparations. Even further, the application refers to the application of the silicon dioxide aerogel as the nano-drug carrying system in the preparation of oral anti-tumor drugs. Further, the mass ratio of the carried drug to the silicon dioxide aerogel is 1:0.5-20. Further, the silicon dioxide aerogel is hydrophilic silicon dioxide aerogel or the silicon dioxide aerogel with hydrophily, which is obtained after heat treatment of hydrophobic silicon dioxide aerogel. Even further, the temperature for heat treatment is 300-1000° C. Further, the application of the silicon dioxide aerogel as the nano-drug carrying system in pharmacy is implemented through the following way: When the carried drug is a soluble drug, the carried drug is firstly prepared into a saturated or unsaturated solution, and then the silicon dioxide aerogel is added for adsorption; and when the carried drug is a hardly soluble or insoluble drug, the carried drug is firstly prepared into a suspension, and then the silicon dioxide aerogel is added for adsorption or the carried drug and the silicon dioxide aerogel are prepared into the suspension together. In addition, sometimes, some more complex dosage forms still need to be used to prevent degradation of the drug and achieve the requirement of controlled release or targeted treatment. Thus, the silicon dioxide aerogel can be applied to the existing preparation technologies, such as micro-pelletization, granulation, spray drying or freeze drying, thereby preparing the nano-suspension into a solid preparation. The invention has the following benefits: compared with the prior art, the invention has the following advantages: 1. The invention found a new pharmaceutical excipient in the field of pharmacy, the pharmaceutical excipient is not currently popular nanoparticle material or nanopowder, but is a drug carrying hole new structure which really realizes nanosize. The physical drug carrying scale below 100 nm which cannot be realized by any one excipient in the current pharmaceutical excipients is realized, and the blank in nanosized pharmaceutical excipients at home and abroad is filled up, thereby having universality significance in the creation of the dosage forms of a variety of drugs, being capable of promoting relatively fast production of a series of unprecedented new dosage forms of the drugs, greatly shortening the development process of the developing drugs, forming a new drug research and development mode, fundamentally breaking through the existing modes and the methods for creating the drugs and realizing large-scale creation of the new drugs. The physical scale of polypeptide gene and protein type drugs is below 10 nm, and the application of such pharmaceutical excipients brings new hope to such hot studies. 2. As for nanoparticles prepared by taking the silicon dioxide aerogel of the invention as a carrier material, the drug carrying amount can be above 90%, which is unmatched by the existing liposome nanoparticles, polymer nanoparticles and the like, and the drug carrying amount can be comparable to that of the nanocrystal type drug suspension. But the manufacturing method is simpler and the cost is lower. 3. In the nanoparticles prepared by taking the silicon dioxide aerogel of the invention as the carrier material, the active drug is loaded in numerous nanosized holes of the silicon dioxide aerogel to form independent “nano-dispersions” which cannot be aggregated, and the structure is very stable, so that the international difficult problems that the drugs cannot be formed due to aggregation in the studies of micronano-drugs, hardly soluble drugs are very difficult to improve the bioavailability and the like in the science of preparations are directly solved. 4. The nanoparticles with the diameter of below 100 nm can be prepared by taking the silicon dioxide aerogel of the invention as the carrier material, the diameter range has achieved the nanoscale in the scope of material science, while the diameter of the existing nanoparticles cannot achieve this scale. Although the particles with the diameter of less than 1 μm are called as nanoparticles, people tend to develop the particles with the particle size of less than 100 nm. Because these particles can represent some unique physical properties, the potential different and usable biological properties are shown. For example, by being limited by microcirculation of capillary vessels of an organism and cell barriers, the optimal particle size of pharmaceutical particles which can enter blood circulation and be absorbed by the organism is 10-100 nm. Thus, the nanoparticles prepared by taking the silicon dioxide aerogel of the invention as the carrier material achieve a qualitative leap in the aspect of bioavailability, thereby creating conditions for the preparation of oral preparations from the hardly soluble drugs. 5. The nanosized drugs prepared by taking the silicon dioxide aerogel of the invention as the carrier material realize a brand new oral administration mechanism which takes nano-intake as a main absorption way, greatly increase the solubility of the hardly soluble drugs through the brand new structure of “nano-solid dispersions”, break through the international restricted area that the hardly soluble drugs cannot be absorbed by oral administration, fully realize the medicinal effect, improve the oral bioavailability unprecedentedly, transform and upgrade thousands of hardly soluble drugs accounting for more than 40% of the total quantity of the drugs all around the world and provide a real technical support platform. 6. A precursor of the silicon dioxide aerogel is low in price and easy to obtain, has been widely applied in the drugs and foods, is a silicon-based medicinal and edible excipient which is in line with national and internal standards and has been used for many years and is also one of the excipients recorded in Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, so that the safety of the silicon dioxide aerogel as the pharmaceutical excipient is reliable. 7. Anti-tumor oral drugs with high efficiency, low toxicity, economy and a “targeting function” can be prepared by applying the silicon dioxide aerogel to the field of preparation of the anti-tumor drugs, thereby solving the international pharmaceutical difficult problems of low bioavailability, high toxicity and side effects, poor curative effect and high treatment cost of anti-tumor clinical first-line and second-line drugs taking injections as the main dosage form, which have not been solved at home and aboard after decades of efforts. For example, in the oral dosage form of paclitaxel, a harmful solvent, namely polyoxyethylenated castor oil or Tween 80 and ethanol, which are currently adopted for solubilizing in the clinical first-line injection dosage form, do not need to be used, so that the bioavailability of patent drugs is improved unprecedentedly and the toxicity is greatly reduced. The nano-EPR (high-permeability and high-retention) effect which is highly respected by the international academic community is firstly really realized in the pharmaceutical practice, the bioavailability which can replace the injection with oral administration is firstly directly realized at the material level, and the nano-target delivery to a tumor part is simultaneously realized, so that original systemic toxicity and cytotoxic drugs with serious adverse reactions (such as paclitaxel, docetaxel and the like) can be aggregated to the tumor part, the curative effect is improved, the systemic toxicity and side effects are reduced, and a solid foundation is thus laid for taking the silicon dioxide aerogel as a platform material of a nano-target drug carrying system. 8. By combining the silicon dioxide aerogel with the drugs with the target treatment function (such as Xeloda, Iressa and the like), the “double-target” and “multi-target” anti-tumor applications can be realized, the “nano-target drug carrying system” is realized in a real sense and the dream of the researchers in the field of nano-drugs in half a century is realized (the nano-concept is proposed in 1940s). 9. In preclinical studies, the inventor makes a lot of experimental studies according to the requirements of related technical guideline of the anti-tumor drugs, and the research results prove that, in the studies taking human transplanted tumors as objects, the tumor inhibition rate of the oral nano preparations can achieve 80%, the absolute bioavailability exceeds 20%, and the toxicity is far lower than that of similar anti-tumor injection drugs in the comparison studies. 10. As the invention adopts the novel nano-material, namely the silicon dioxide aerogel as the drug carrying platform and fully uses the ultralarge specific surface area, ultralarge nano-drug carrying space, chemical and physical stability, biological inertia and other characteristics of the silicon dioxide aerogel, any special process methods and special equipment do not need to be adopted in the manufacturing process of the drugs, the standardized large-scale production of a variety of nano-drugs with stable quality can be achieved by using the common equipment for manufacturing the drugs, such as a homogenizer, a spray drying device and other equipment. Thus, the invention is expected to cause a revolution in the field of pharmacy or new preparation production ways. The pharmaceutical action of nanosized drugs prepared by taking the silicon dioxide aerogel as the carrier material are illustrated through experiments by taking paclitaxel and docetaxel as examples, and the silicon dioxide aerogel used in the experiments was selected from the silicon dioxide aerogel with the following properties: the porosity was 95-99%, the aperture was 10-50 nm, the specific surface area was 200-1000 m2/g, the density was 3-300 kg/m3 and the diameter of colloidal particles constituting a network was 1-50 nm.

Experimental Method 5.1 Preparation of Model A cultured human lung cancer A549 suspension was collected, the concentration was 1×107/ml, and the suspension was inoculated subcutaneously to the right armpit of each nude mouse according to 0.1 ml/mouse. 5.2 Grouping and Drug Administration The diameter of the transplanted tumor in each nude mouse was measured by using the vernier caliper, and when the tumors grew to 50-75 mm3 after 11 days of inoculation, the animals were randomly grouped according to 6 mice/group. Meanwhile, the drug administration was started to perform on the nude mice in each group, for the drug administration schemes and the groups, please refer to the drug administration schemes, and the anti-tumor effect of the test samples were dynamically observed by using the method of measuring the tumor diameter. After the drug administration, the mice were killed and the tumor blocks were surgically stripped for weighing. 5.3 Observation Indexes The calculation formula of the tumor volume (TV) was as follows: TV=½×a×b2, wherein a and b respectively represented length and width. The relative tumor volume (RTV) was calculated according to the measurement result, and the calculation formula was as follows: [in-line-formulae]RTV=Vt/V0,[/in-line-formulae] wherein V0 was the tumor volume obtained by measurement during caging and drug administration (d0) and Vt was the tumor volume which was measured every time. The evaluation index of anti-tumor activity was relative tumor proliferation rate T/C (%), and the calculation formula was as follows: [in-line-formulae]T/C(%)=Trtv/Crtv×100,[/in-line-formulae] wherein Trtv was the RTV of the treatment group; and C was the RTV of the model group. The evaluation index of anti-tumor activity was tumor growth inhibition rate (%), and the calculation formula was as follows: [in-line-formulae]Tumor growth inhibition rate=(average tumor weight of model group−average tumor weight of drug administration group)/average tumor weight of model group×100%.[/in-line-formulae] 5.4 Statistical Processing The mean value was represented by X±SD, the analysis between groups used t test to perform statistical processing, and SPSS (Staffstical Package for the Social Science) 17.0 was used to perform statistical analysis on the results. 6.

Discussions: The experiments established the human lung cancer A549 nude mouse xenograft tumor model, and the model was used for evaluating the anti-tumor activity of the test samples, namely nano-paclitaxel and nano-docetaxel. The experimental results were as follows: the tumor inhibition rate of the test sample, namely nano-paclitaxel in each group of the low dose group of 50 mg/kg, the medium dose group of 100 mg/kg and high dose group of 200 mg/kg was 33.67%, 42.21% and 34.67% respectively. The tumor inhibition rate of the test sample, namely nano-docetaxel in each group of the low dose group of 50 mg/kg, the medium dose group of 100 mg/kg and high dose group of 200 mg/kg was 49.75%, 69.85% and 78.89% respectively. While the tumor inhibition rate of each of the positive control groups, namely commercial paclitaxel and commercial docetaxel was 62.81% and 78.89% respectively. The conclusion was that the nano-paclitaxel had a certain anti-tumor effect, the nano-docetaxel had obvious anti-tumor effect, while the medium dose group and the high dose group had significant difference, namely P<0.01.
