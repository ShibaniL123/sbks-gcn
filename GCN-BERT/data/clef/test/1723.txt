CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S) This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/990,140 filed May 8, 2014, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid or their di-esters, dimethyl terephthalate as for example, are used to produce a variety of polyester products, important examples of which are poly(ethylene terephthalate) and its copolymers. The aromatic dicarboxylic acids are synthesized by the catalytic oxidation of the corresponding dialkyl aromatic compounds which are obtained from fossil fuels (US 2006/0205977 A1). Esterification of these diacids using excess alcohol produces the corresponding di-esters (US2010/0210867A1). There is a growing interest in the use of renewable resources as feed stocks for the chemical industries mainly due to the progressive reduction of fossil reserves and their related environmental impacts. Furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) is a versatile intermediate considered as a promising closest biobased alternative to terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid. Like aromatic diacids, FDCA can be condensed with diols such as ethylene glycol to make polyester resins similar to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Gandini, A.; Silvestre, A. J; Neto, C. P.; Sousa, A. F.; Gomes, M., J. Poly. Sci. A 2009, 47, 295). FDCA has been prepared by oxidation of 5-(hydroxymethyl) furfural (5-HMF) under air using homogenous catalysts (US2003/0055271 A1 and Partenheimer, W.; Grushin, V. V., Adv. Synth. Catal. 2001, 343, 102-111.) but only a maximum of 44.8% yield using a Co/Mn/Br catalyst system and a maximum of 60.9% yield was reported using Co/Mn/Br/Zr catalysts combination. Recently, we reported a process for producing furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in high yields by liquid phase oxidation of 5-HMF or its derivatives using a Co/Mn/Br catalyst system that minimizes solvent and starting material loss through carbon burn (U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 13/228,803, 13/228,809, 13/228,816, and Ser. No. 13/228,799, herein incorporated by reference). Disclosed is a method for recovering a portion of oxidation solvent, a portion of oxidation catalyst, and removing a portion of oxidation by-products and raw material impurities from a solvent stream generated in a process to make furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA). The process comprises oxidizing a feed stream comprising at least one oxidizable compound selected from the following group: 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (5-HMF), 5-HMF esters (5-R(CO)OCH2-furfural where R=alkyl, cycloalkyl and aryl), 5-HMF ethers (5-R′OCH2-furfural, where R′=alkyl, cycloalkyl and aryl), 5-alkyl furfurals (5-R″-furfural, where R″=alkyl, cycloalkyl and aryl), mixed feed-stocks of 5-HMF and 5-HMF esters and mixed feed-stocks of 5-HMF and 5-HMF ethers and mixed feed-stocks of 5-HMF and 5-alkyl furfurals to generate a crude carboxylic acid slurry comprising furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) in an oxidation zone, cooling a crude carboxylic acid slurry in a cooling zone to generate a cooled crude carboxylic acid slurry, removing impurities from a cooled crude carboxylic acid slurry in a solid-liquid separation zone to form a low impurity carboxylic acid stream and a mother liquor stream, routing at least a portion of the mother liquor stream to a mother liquor purge zone to generate a recycle oxidation solvent stream, a recycle catalyst rich stream, a raffinate stream, and an impurity rich waste stream.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION It should be understood that the following is not intended to be an exclusive list of defined terms. Other definitions may be provided in the foregoing description, such as, for example, when accompanying the use of a defined term in context. As used herein, the terms “a,” “an,” and “the” mean one or more. As used herein, the term “and/or,” when used in a list of two or more items, means that any one of the listed items can be employed by itself or any combination of two or more of the listed items can be employed. For example, if a composition is described as containing components A, B, and/or C, the composition can contain A alone; B alone; C alone; A and B in combination; A and C in combination, B and C in combination; or A, B, and C in combination. As used herein, the terms “comprising,” “comprises,” and “comprise” are open-ended transition terms used to transition from a subject recited before the term to one or more elements recited after the term, where the element or elements listed after the transition term are not necessarily the only elements that make up the subject. As used herein, the terms “having,” “has,” and “have” have the same open-ended meaning as “comprising,” “comprises,” and “comprise” provided above. As used herein, the terms “including,” “includes,” and “include” have the same open-ended meaning as “comprising,” “comprises,” and “comprise” provided above. The present description uses numerical ranges to quantify certain parameters relating to the invention. It should be understood that when numerical ranges are provided, such ranges are to be construed as providing literal support for claim limitations that only recite the lower value of the range as well as claim limitations that only recite the upper value of the range. For example, a disclosed numerical range of 10 to 100 provides literal support for a claim reciting “greater than 10” (with no upper bounds) and a claim reciting “less than 100” (with no lower bounds). The present description uses specific numerical values to quantify certain parameters relating to the invention, where the specific numerical values are not expressly part of a numerical range. It should be understood that each specific numerical value provided herein is to be construed as providing literal support for a broad, intermediate, and narrow range. The broad range associated with each specific numerical value is the numerical value plus and minus 60 percent of the numerical value, rounded to two significant digits. The intermediate range associated with each specific numerical value is the numerical value plus and minus 30 percent of the numerical value, rounded to two significant digits. The narrow range associated with each specific numerical value is the numerical value plus and minus 15 percent of the numerical value, rounded to two significant digits. For example, if the specification describes a specific temperature of 62° F., such a description provides literal support for a broad numerical range of 25° F. to 99° F. (62° F.+/−37° F.), an intermediate numerical range of 43° F. to 81° F. (62° F.+/−19° F.), and a narrow numerical range of 53° F. to 71° F. (62° F.+/−9° F.). These broad, intermediate, and narrow numerical ranges should be applied not only to the specific values, but should also be applied to differences between these specific values. Thus, if the specification describes a first pressure of 110 psia and a second pressure of 48 psia (a difference of 62 psi), the broad, intermediate, and narrow ranges for the pressure difference between these two streams would be 25 to 99 psi, 43 to 81 psi, and 53 to 71 psi, respectively One embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2.

At least a portion of the impurity rich waste stream 712 is routed to a solid liquid separation zone 720 to generate a purge mother liquor stream 723 and a wet cake stream 722 comprising impurities. In another embodiment of the invention, all of stream 712 is routed to the solid liquid separation zone 720. Stream 722 may be removed from the process as a waste stream. Wash stream 721 may also be routed to solid-liquid separation zone 720 which will result in wash liquor being present in stream 723. It should be noted that zone 720 is a separate and different zone from zone 300. Any technology known in the art capable of separating solids from slurry may be used. Examples of suitable unit operations include, but are not limited to, batch or continuous filters, batch or continuous centrifuges, filter press, vacuum belt filter, vacuum drum filter, continuous pressure drum filter, candle filters, leaf filters, disc centrifuges, decanter centrifuges, basket centrifuges, and the like. A continuous pressure drum filter is a preferred device for solid-liquid separation zone 720. Purge mother liquor stream 723 comprising catalyst and impurities, and stream 731 comprising a catalyst solvent are routed to mix zone 731 to allow sufficient mixing to generate extraction feed stream 732. In one embodiment, stream 731 comprises water. Mixing is allowed to occur for at least 30 seconds, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or 1 hour. Any technology know in the art may be used for this mixing operation including inline static mixers, continuous stirred tank, mixers, high shear in line mechanical mixers and the like. Extraction feed stream 732, recycle extraction solvent stream 752, and fresh extraction solvent stream 753 are routed to liquid-liquid extraction zone 740 to generate an extract stream 741 comprising impurities and extract solvent, and a raffinate stream 742 comprising catalyst solvent and oxidation catalyst that can be recycled directly or indirectly to the oxidation zone 100. Liquid-liquid extraction zone 740 may be accomplished in a single or multiple extraction units. The extraction units can be batch and or continuous. An example of suitable equipment for extraction zone 740 includes multiple single stage extraction units. Another example of suitable equipment for extraction zone 740 is a single multi stage liquid-liquid continuous extraction column. Extract stream 741 is routed to distillation zone 750 where extraction solvent is isolated by evaporation and condensation to generate recycle extract solvent stream 752. The purge stream 751 is also generated and can be removed from the process as a waste purge stream. Batch or continuous distillation may be used in distillation zone 750. In another embodiment, the source for oxidizer mother liquor stream 330 feeding mother liquor purge zone 700 may originate from any mother liquor stream comprising oxidation solvent, oxidation catalyst, and impurities generated in process to make furan-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (FDCA). For example, a solvent swap zone downstream of oxidation zone 100 that isolates at least a portion of the FDCA oxidation solvent from stream 110 can be a source for stream 330. Suitable equipment for a solvent swap zone comprises solid-liquid separation devices including centrifuges and filters. Examples of suitable equipment for the solvent swap include, but is not limited to, a disc stack centrifuge or a continuous pressure drum filter.
