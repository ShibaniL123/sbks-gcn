Step 7. 3-(o-Tolyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-8-amine
A mixture of dichloro[1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium(II) dichloromethane adduct (0.52 g, 0.64 mmol), o-tolylboronic acid (1.4 g, 10 mmol), and 3-bromo-6-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-8-amine (1.0 g, 3. 6 mmol) in THF (36 mL) and 1.0 M potassium carbonate in water (18 mL, 18 mmol) was degassed with N2 for 5 min and then heated at 80° C. for 5 h. The reaction mixture was filtered through Celite, rinsing with EtOAc and water. The resulting mixture was washed with water (2×75 mL) and brine (70 mL). The organic layer was then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography (1-88% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a white solid (1.1 g, 99% yield). LCMS for C14H12F3N4 (M+H)+: calculated m/z=293.1; found 293.1.
