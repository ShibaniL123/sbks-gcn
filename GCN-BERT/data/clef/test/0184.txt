BACKGROUND The present disclosure relates generally to the field of robotic surgery. In particular, the present disclosure relates to, although not exclusively, robotically controlled surgical instruments. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to, although not exclusively, control systems having haptic feedback for controlling robotic surgical systems. Ultrasonic surgical devices, such as ultrasonic scalpels, are used in many applications in surgical procedures by virtue of their unique performance characteristics. Depending upon specific device configurations and operational parameters, ultrasonic surgical devices can provide substantially simultaneous transection of tissue and homeostasis by coagulation, desirably minimizing patient trauma. An ultrasonic surgical device comprises a proximally-positioned ultrasonic transducer and an instrument coupled to the ultrasonic transducer having a distally-mounted end effector comprising an ultrasonic blade to cut and seal tissue. The end effector is typically coupled either to a handle and/or a robotic surgical implement via a shaft. The blade is acoustically coupled to the transducer via a waveguide extending through the shaft. Ultrasonic surgical devices of this nature can be configured for open surgical use, laparoscopic, or endoscopic surgical procedures including robotic-assisted procedures. Ultrasonic energy cuts and coagulates tissue using temperatures lower than those used in electrosurgical procedures. Vibrating at high frequencies (e.g., 55,500 times per second), the ultrasonic blade denatures protein in the tissue to form a sticky coagulum. Pressure exerted on tissue by the blade surface collapses blood vessels and allows the coagulum to form a haemostatic seal. A surgeon can control the cutting speed and coagulation by the force applied to the tissue by the end effector, the time over which the force is applied and the selected excursion level of the end effector. Also used in many surgical applications are electrosurgical devices. Electrosurgical devices apply electrical energy to tissue in order to treat tissue. An electrosurgical device may comprise an instrument having a distally-mounted end effector comprising one or more electrodes. The end effector can be positioned against tissue such that electrical current is introduced into the tissue. Electrosurgical devices can be configured for bipolar or monopolar operation. During bipolar operation, current is introduced into and returned from the tissue by active and return electrodes, respectively, of the end effector. During monopolar operation, current is introduced into the tissue by an active electrode of the end effector and returned through a return electrode (e.g., a grounding pad) separately located on a patient's body. Heat generated by the current flow through the tissue may form hemostatic seals within the tissue and/or between tissues and thus may be particularly useful for sealing blood vessels, for example. The end effector of an electrosurgical device sometimes also comprises a cutting member that is movable relative to the tissue and the electrodes to transect the tissue. Electrical energy applied by an electrosurgical device can be transmitted to the instrument by a generator. The electrical energy may be in the form of radio frequency (“RF”) energy. RF energy is a form of electrical energy that may be in the frequency range of 300 kHz to 1 MHz. During its operation, an electrosurgical device can transmit low frequency RF energy through tissue, which causes ionic agitation, or friction, in effect resistive heating, thereby increasing the temperature of the tissue. Because a sharp boundary may be created between the affected tissue and the surrounding tissue, surgeons can operate with a high level of precision and control, without sacrificing un-targeted adjacent tissue. The low operating temperatures of RF energy may be useful for removing, shrinking, or sculpting soft tissue while simultaneously sealing blood vessels. RF energy may work particularly well on connective tissue, which is primarily comprised of collagen and shrinks when contacted by heat. Current robotic surgical systems utilize specialized control systems designed specifically for each machine. The specialized control systems require a surgeon to train and become proficient on the specialized control system prior to use of a robotic surgical system in actual surgery. In addition to long training times, use of specialized control systems may result in a surgeon loosing proficiency with non-robotic surgical systems and techniques. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a control system for robotic surgical systems usable by the majority of surgeons with minimal training. It would also be desirable to have a control system which simulated the use of non-robotic surgical instruments. SUMMARY Various embodiments of surgical robot control systems are disclosed. In one example embodiment, the surgical robot control system comprises a housing. A controller is located within the housing and is coupled to a socket. The socket receives a handheld surgical user interface therein to control a surgical instrument. The surgical instrument is connected to the surgical robot and comprises an end effector and a mechanical interface to manipulate the end effector. The mechanical interface is coupled to the controller. At least one sensor is coupled to the controller and the socket to convert movement of the handheld surgical user interface into electrical signals corresponding to the movement of the surgical instrument. At least one feedback device is coupled to the controller to provide feedback to a user. The feedback is associated with a predetermined function of the surgical instrument.

DESCRIPTION Various example embodiments are directed to a control system for a robotic surgical system. The robotic surgical control system may comprise a housing. A controller is located within the housing and is coupled to a socket. The socket receives a handheld surgical user interface therein to control a surgical instrument. The surgical instrument is connected to the surgical robot and comprises an end effector and a mechanical interface to manipulate the end effector. The mechanical interface is coupled to the controller. At least one sensor is coupled to the controller and the socket to convert movement of the handheld surgical user interface into electrical signals corresponding to the movement of the surgical instrument. At least one feedback device is coupled to the controller to provide feedback to a user. The feedback is associated with a predetermined function of the surgical instrument. Some example embodiments are directed towards robotic surgical control systems having a handheld surgical user interface comprising a lever. The lever may be translatably moveable in a distal/proximal direction, an up/down direction, and/or a left/right direction. The lever may also be rotatably moveable about a pivot point in any of proximal/distal, up/down, or left/right planes. In some example embodiments, the lever may comprise one or more additional inputs, such as, for example, a trigger, a switch, a resistive sleeve, or any other suitable input. Other example embodiments are directed towards robotic surgical control systems including a handheld surgical user interface comprising a surgical device handle. The surgical device handle may be configured to simulate the feel and operation of non-robotic surgical instruments, such as, for example, non-robotic endoscopic instruments. The surgical device handle may be translatably moveable in a distal/proximal direction, an up/down direction, and/or a left/right direction. The surgical device handle may also be rotatably moveable about a pivot point in any of proximal/distal, up/down, or left/right planes. In some embodiments, the surgical device handle may include one or more additional inputs, such as, for example, a trigger, a switch, one or more rotational knobs, or any other suitable input. In additional example embodiments, the robotic surgical control system includes one or more feedback devices. In some embodiments, the one or more feedback devices may be located in the housing. In other embodiments, the one or more feedback devices may be located in or on the handheld surgical user interface. The one or more feedback devices may provide any suitable form of sensory feedback, such as, for example, auditory feedback (sound), haptic or tactile feedback (touch), optical feedback (visual), olfactory feedback (smell), gustatory feedback (taste), and/or equilibrioception (balance feedback). Haptic feedback may be provided through various forms, for example, mechanosensation, including, but not limited to, vibrosensation (vibrations) and pressure-sensation, thermoperception (heat), and/or cryoperception (cold). Reference will now be made in detail to several embodiments, including embodiments showing example implementations of manual and robotic surgical instruments with end effectors comprising ultrasonic and/or electrosurgical elements. Wherever practicable similar or like reference numbers may be used in the figures and may indicate similar or like functionality. The figures depict example embodiments of the disclosed surgical instruments and/or methods of use for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following description that alternative example embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles described herein. FIG. 1 is a right side view of one embodiment of an ultrasonic surgical instrument 10. In the illustrated embodiment, the ultrasonic surgical instrument 10 may be employed in various surgical procedures including endoscopic or traditional open surgical procedures. In one example embodiment, the ultrasonic surgical instrument 10 comprises a handle assembly 12, an elongated shaft assembly 14, and an ultrasonic transducer 16. The handle assembly 12 comprises a trigger assembly 24, a distal rotation assembly 13, and a switch assembly 28. The elongated shaft assembly 14 comprises an end effector assembly 26, which comprises elements to dissect tissue or mutually grasp, cut, and coagulate vessels and/or tissue, and actuating elements to actuate the end effector assembly 26. The handle assembly 12 is adapted to receive the ultrasonic transducer 16 at the proximal end. The ultrasonic transducer 16 is mechanically engaged to the elongated shaft assembly 14 and portions of the end effector assembly 26. The ultrasonic transducer 16 is electrically coupled to a generator 20 via a cable 22. Although the majority of the drawings depict a multiple end effector assembly 26 for use in connection with laparoscopic surgical procedures, the ultrasonic surgical instrument 10 may be employed in more traditional open surgical procedures and in other embodiments, and may be configured for use in endoscopic procedures. For the purposes herein, the ultrasonic surgical instrument 10 is described in terms of an endoscopic instrument; however, it is contemplated that an open and/or laparoscopic version of the ultrasonic surgical instrument 10 also may include the same or similar operating components and features as described herein. In various embodiments, the generator 20 comprises several functional elements, such as modules and/or blocks. Different functional elements or modules may be configured for driving different kinds of surgical devices. For example, an ultrasonic generator module 21 may drive an ultrasonic device, such as the ultrasonic surgical instrument 10. In some example embodiments, the generator 20 also comprises an electrosurgery/RF generator module 23 for driving an electrosurgical device (or an electrosurgical embodiment of the ultrasonic surgical instrument 10). In various embodiments, the generator 20 may be formed integrally within the handle assembly 12. In such implementations, a battery would be co-located within the handle assembly 12 to act as the energy source. FIG. 18A and accompanying disclosures provide one example of such implementations. As shown in FIG. 1, according to various embodiments, the ultrasonic generator module 21 and/or the electrosurgery/RF generator module 23 may be located external to the generator (shown in phantom as ultrasonic generator module 21′ and electrosurgery/RF generator module 23′). In some embodiments, the electrosurgery/RF generator module 23 may be configured to generate a therapeutic and/or a sub-therapeutic energy level. In the example embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the generator 20 includes a control system 25 integral with the generator 20 and a foot switch 29 connected to the generator via a cable 27. The generator 20 may also comprise a triggering mechanism for activating a surgical instrument, such as the instrument 10. The triggering mechanism may include a power switch (not shown) as well as a foot switch 29. When activated by the foot switch 29, the generator 20 may provide energy to drive the acoustic assembly of the surgical instrument 10 and to drive the end effector 18 at a predetermined excursion level. The generator 20 drives or excites the acoustic assembly at any suitable resonant frequency of the acoustic assembly and/or derives the therapeutic/sub-therapeutic electromagnetic/RF energy. In one embodiment, the electrosurgical/RF generator module 23 may be implemented as an electrosurgery unit (ESU) capable of supplying power sufficient to perform bipolar electrosurgery using radio frequency (RF) energy. In one embodiment, the ESU can be a bipolar ERBE ICC 350 sold by ERBE USA, Inc. of Marietta, Ga. In bipolar electrosurgery applications, as previously discussed, a surgical instrument having an active electrode and a return electrode can be utilized, wherein the active electrode and the return electrode can be positioned against, or adjacent to, the tissue to be treated such that current can flow from the active electrode to the return electrode through the tissue. Accordingly, the electrosurgical/RF module 23 generator may be configured for therapeutic purposes by applying electrical energy to the tissue T sufficient for treating the tissue (e.g., cauterization). In one embodiment, the electrosurgical/RF generator module 23 may be configured to deliver a sub-therapeutic RF signal to implement a tissue impedance measurement module. In one embodiment, the electrosurgical/RF generator module 23 comprises a bipolar radio frequency generator as described in more detail below. In one embodiment, the electrosurgical/RF generator module 23 may be configured to monitor electrical impedance Z, of tissue T and to control the characteristics of time and power level based on the tissue T by way of a return electrode on provided on a clamp member of the end effector assembly 26. Accordingly, the electrosurgical/RF generator module 23 may be configured for sub-therapeutic purposes for measuring the impedance or other electrical characteristics of the tissue T. Techniques and circuit configurations for measuring the impedance or other electrical characteristics of tissue T are discussed in more detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Publication No. 2011/0015631, titled “Electrosurgical Generator for Ultrasonic Surgical Instruments,” the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. A suitable ultrasonic generator module 21 may be configured to functionally operate in a manner similar to the GEN300 sold by Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. of Cincinnati, Ohio as is disclosed in one or more of the following U.S. patents, all of which are incorporated by reference herein: U.S. Pat. No. 6,480,796 (Method for Improving the Start Up of an Ultrasonic System Under Zero Load Conditions); U.S. Pat. No. 6,537,291 (Method for Detecting Blade Breakage Using Rate and/or Impedance Information); U.S. Pat. No. 6,662,127 (Method for Detecting Presence of a Blade in an Ultrasonic System); U.S. Pat. No. 6,679,899 (Method for Detecting Transverse Vibrations in an Ultrasonic Hand Piece); U.S. Pat. No. 6,977,495 (Detection Circuitry for Surgical Handpiece System); U.S. Pat. No. 7,077,853 (Method for Calculating Transducer Capacitance to Determine Transducer Temperature); U.S. Pat. No. 7,179,271 (Method for Driving an Ultrasonic System to Improve Acquisition of Blade Resonance Frequency at Startup); and U.S. Pat. No. 7,273,483 (Apparatus and Method for Alerting Generator Function in an Ultrasonic Surgical System). It will be appreciated that in various embodiments, the generator 20 may be configured to operate in several modes. In one mode, the generator 20 may be configured such that the ultrasonic generator module 21 and the electrosurgical/RF generator module 23 may be operated independently. For example, the ultrasonic generator module 21 may be activated to apply ultrasonic energy to the end effector assembly 26 and subsequently, either therapeutic or sub-therapeutic RF energy may be applied to the end effector assembly 26 by the electrosurgical/RF generator module 23. As previously discussed, the subtherapeutic electrosurgical/RF energy may be applied to tissue clamped between claim elements of the end effector assembly 26 to measure tissue impedance to control the activation, or modify the activation, of the ultrasonic generator module 21. Tissue impedance feedback from the application of the subtherapeutic energy also may be employed to activate a therapeutic level of the electrosurgical/RF generator module 23 to seal the tissue (e.g., vessel) clamped between claim elements of the end effector assembly 26. In another embodiment, the ultrasonic generator module 21 and the electrosurgical/RF generator module 23 may be activated simultaneously. In one example, the ultrasonic generator module 21 is simultaneously activated with a sub-therapeutic RF energy level to measure tissue impedance simultaneously while the ultrasonic blade of the end effector assembly 26 cuts and coagulates the tissue (or vessel) clamped between the clamp elements of the end effector assembly 26. Such feedback may be employed, for example, to modify the drive output of the ultrasonic generator module 21. In another example, the ultrasonic generator module 21 may be driven simultaneously with electrosurgical/RF generator module 23 such that the ultrasonic blade portion of the end effector assembly 26 is employed for cutting the damaged tissue while the electrosurgical/RF energy is applied to electrode portions of the end effector clamp assembly 26 for sealing the tissue (or vessel). When the generator 20 is activated via the triggering mechanism, in one embodiment electrical energy is continuously applied by the generator 20 to a transducer stack or assembly of the acoustic assembly. In another embodiment, electrical energy is intermittently applied (e.g., pulsed) by the generator 20. A phase-locked loop in the control system of the generator 20 may monitor feedback from the acoustic assembly. The phase lock loop adjusts the frequency of the electrical energy sent by the generator 20 to match the resonant frequency of the selected longitudinal mode of vibration of the acoustic assembly. In addition, a second feedback loop in the control system 25 maintains the electrical current supplied to the acoustic assembly at a pre-selected constant level in order to achieve substantially constant excursion at the end effector 18 of the acoustic assembly. In yet another embodiment, a third feedback loop in the control system 25 monitors impedance between electrodes located in the end effector assembly 26. Although FIGS. 1-9 show a manually operated ultrasonic surgical instrument, it will be appreciated that ultrasonic surgical instruments may also be used in robotic applications, for example, as described herein, as well as combinations of manual and robotic applications. In ultrasonic operation mode, the electrical signal supplied to the acoustic assembly may cause the distal end of the end effector 18, to vibrate longitudinally in the range of, for example, approximately 20 kHz to 250 kHz. According to various embodiments, the blade 22 may vibrate in the range of about 54 kHz to 56 kHz, for example, at about 55.5 kHz. In other embodiments, the blade 22 may vibrate at other frequencies including, for example, about 31 kHz or about 80 kHz. The excursion of the vibrations at the blade can be controlled by, for example, controlling the amplitude of the electrical signal applied to the transducer assembly of the acoustic assembly by the generator 20. As noted above, the triggering mechanism of the generator 20 allows a user to activate the generator 20 so that electrical energy may be continuously or intermittently supplied to the acoustic assembly. The generator 20 also has a power line for insertion in an electro-surgical unit or conventional electrical outlet. It is contemplated that the generator 20 can also be powered by a direct current (DC) source, such as a battery. The generator 20 can comprise any suitable generator, such as Model No. GEN04, and/or Model No. GEN11 available from Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. FIG. 2 is a left perspective view of one example embodiment of the ultrasonic surgical instrument 10 showing the handle assembly 12, the distal rotation assembly 13, the elongated shaft assembly 14, and the end effector assembly 26. In the illustrated embodiment the elongated shaft assembly 14 comprises a distal end 52 dimensioned to mechanically engage the end effector assembly 26 and a proximal end 50 that mechanically engages the handle assembly 12 and the distal rotation assembly 13. The proximal end 50 of the elongated shaft assembly 14 is received within the handle assembly 12 and the distal rotation assembly 13. More details relating to the connections between the elongated endoscopic shaft assembly 14, the handle assembly 12, and the distal rotation assembly 13 are provided in the description of FIGS. 5 and 7. In the illustrated embodiment, the trigger assembly 24 comprises a trigger 32 that operates in conjunction with a fixed handle 34. The fixed handle 34 and the trigger 32 are ergonomically formed and adapted to interface comfortably with the user. The fixed handle 34 is integrally associated with the handle assembly 12. The trigger 32 is pivotally movable relative to the fixed handle 34 as explained in more detail below with respect to the operation of the ultrasonic surgical instrument 10. The trigger 32 is pivotally movable in direction 33A toward the fixed handle 34 when the user applies a squeezing force against the trigger 32. A spring element 98 (FIG. 5) causes the trigger 32 to pivotally move in direction 33B when the user releases the squeezing force against the trigger 32. In one example embodiment, the trigger 32 comprises an elongated trigger hook 36, which defines an aperture 38 between the elongated trigger hook 36 and the trigger 32. The aperture 38 is suitably sized to receive one or multiple fingers of the user therethrough. The trigger 32 also may comprise a resilient portion 32a molded over the trigger 32 substrate. The resilient portion 32a is formed to provide a more comfortable contact surface for control of the trigger 32 in outward direction 33B. In one example embodiment, the resilient portion 32a may also be provided over a portion of the elongated trigger hook 36 as shown, for example, in FIG. 2. The proximal surface of the elongated trigger hook 32 remains uncoated or coated with a non-resilient substrate to enable the user to easily slide their fingers in and out of the aperture 38. In another embodiment, the geometry of the trigger forms a fully closed loop which defines an aperture suitably sized to receive one or multiple fingers of the user therethrough. The fully closed loop trigger also may comprise a resilient portion molded over the trigger substrate. In one example embodiment, the fixed handle 34 comprises a proximal contact surface 40 and a grip anchor or saddle surface 42. The saddle surface 42 rests on the web where the thumb and the index finger are joined on the hand. The proximal contact surface 40 has a pistol grip contour that receives the palm of the hand in a normal pistol grip with no rings or apertures. The profile curve of the proximal contact surface 40 may be contoured to accommodate or receive the palm of the hand. A stabilization tail 44 is located towards a more proximal portion of the handle assembly 12. The stabilization tail 44 may be in contact with the uppermost web portion of the hand located between the thumb and the index finger to stabilize the handle assembly 12 and make the handle assembly 12 more controllable. In one example embodiment, the switch assembly 28 may comprise a toggle switch 30. The toggle switch 30 may be implemented as a single component with a central pivot 304 located within inside the handle assembly 12 to eliminate the possibility of simultaneous activation. In one example embodiment, the toggle switch 30 comprises a first projecting knob 30a and a second projecting knob 30b to set the power setting of the ultrasonic transducer 16 between a minimum power level (e.g., MIN) and a maximum power level (e.g., MAX). In another embodiment, the rocker switch may pivot between a standard setting and a special setting. The special setting may allow one or more special programs to be implemented by the device. The toggle switch 30 rotates about the central pivot as the first projecting knob 30a and the second projecting knob 30b are actuated. The one or more projecting knobs 30a, 30b are coupled to one or more arms that move through a small arc and cause electrical contacts to close or open an electric circuit to electrically energize or de-energize the ultrasonic transducer 16 in accordance with the activation of the first or second projecting knobs 30a, 30b. The toggle switch 30 is coupled to the generator 20 to control the activation of the ultrasonic transducer 16. The toggle switch 30 comprises one or more electrical power setting switches to activate the ultrasonic transducer 16 to set one or more power settings for the ultrasonic transducer 16. The forces required to activate the toggle switch 30 are directed substantially toward the saddle point 42, thus avoiding any tendency of the instrument to rotate in the hand when the toggle switch 30 is activated. In one example embodiment, the first and second projecting knobs 30a, 30b are located on the distal end of the handle assembly 12 such that they can be easily accessible by the user to activate the power with minimal, or substantially no, repositioning of the hand grip, making it suitable to maintain control and keep attention focused on the surgical site (e.g., a monitor in a laparoscopic procedure) while activating the toggle switch 30. The projecting knobs 30a, 30b may be configured to wrap around the side of the handle assembly 12 to some extent to be more easily accessible by variable finger lengths and to allow greater freedom of access to activation in awkward positions or for shorter fingers. In the illustrated embodiment, the first projecting knob 30a comprises a plurality of tactile elements 30c, e.g., textured projections or “bumps” in the illustrated embodiment, to allow the user to differentiate the first projecting knob 30a from the second projecting knob 30b. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that several ergonomic features may be incorporated into the handle assembly 12. Such ergonomic features are described in U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2009/0105750 entitled “Ergonomic Surgical Instruments”, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,623,027, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In one example embodiment, the toggle switch 30 may be operated by the hand of the user. The user may easily access the first and second projecting knobs 30a, 30b at any point while also avoiding inadvertent or unintentional activation at any time. The toggle switch 30 may readily operated with a finger to control the power to the ultrasonic assembly 16 and/or to the ultrasonic assembly 16. For example, the index finger may be employed to activate the first contact portion 30a to turn on the ultrasonic assembly 16 to a maximum (MAX) power level. The index finger may be employed to activate the second contact portion 30b to turn on the ultrasonic assembly 16 to a minimum (MIN) power level. In another embodiment, the rocker switch may pivot the instrument 10 between a standard setting and a special setting. The special setting may allow one or more special programs to be implemented by the instrument 10. The toggle switch 30 may be operated without the user having to look at the first or second projecting knob 30a, 30b. For example, the first projecting knob 30a or the second projecting knob 30b may comprise a texture or projections to tactilely differentiate between the first and second projecting knobs 30a, 30b without looking. In other embodiments, the trigger 32 and/or the toggle switch 30 may be employed to actuate the electrosurgical/RF generator module 23 individually or in combination with activation of the ultrasonic generator module 21. In one example embodiment, the distal rotation assembly 13 is rotatable without limitation in either direction about a longitudinal axis “T.” The distal rotation assembly 13 is mechanically engaged to the elongated shaft assembly 14. The distal rotation assembly 13 is located on a distal end of the handle assembly 12. The distal rotation assembly 13 comprises a cylindrical hub 46 and a rotation knob 48 formed over the hub 46. The hub 46 mechanically engages the elongated shaft assembly 14. The rotation knob 48 may comprise fluted polymeric features and may be engaged by a finger (e.g., an index finger) to rotate the elongated shaft assembly 14. The hub 46 may comprise a material molded over the primary structure to form the rotation knob 48. The rotation knob 48 may be overmolded over the hub 46. The hub 46 comprises an end cap portion 46a that is exposed at the distal end. The end cap portion 46a of the hub 46 may contact the surface of a trocar during laparoscopic procedures. The hub 46 may be formed of a hard durable plastic such as polycarbonate to alleviate any friction that may occur between the end cap portion 46a and the trocar. The rotation knob 48 may comprise “scallops” or flutes formed of raised ribs 48a and concave portions 48b located between the ribs 48a to provide a more precise rotational grip. In one example embodiment, the rotation knob 48 may comprise a plurality of flutes (e.g., three or more flutes). In other embodiments, any suitable number of flutes may be employed. The rotation knob 48 may be formed of a softer polymeric material overmolded onto the hard plastic material. For example, the rotation knob 48 may be formed of pliable, resilient, flexible polymeric materials including Versaflex® TPE alloys made by GLS Corporation, for example. This softer overmolded material may provide a greater grip and more precise control of the movement of the rotation knob 48. It will be appreciated that any materials that provide adequate resistance to sterilization, are biocompatible, and provide adequate frictional resistance to surgical gloves may be employed to form the rotation knob 48. In one example embodiment, the handle assembly 12 is formed from two (2) housing portions or shrouds comprising a first portion 12a and a second portion 12b. From the perspective of a user viewing the handle assembly 12 from the distal end towards the proximal end, the first portion 12a is considered the right portion and the second portion 12b is considered the left portion. Each of the first and second portions 12a, 12b includes a plurality of interfaces 69 (FIG. 7) dimensioned to mechanically align and engage each another to form the handle assembly 12 and enclosing the internal working components thereof. The fixed handle 34, which is integrally associated with the handle assembly 12, takes shape upon the assembly of the first and second portions 12a and 12b of the handle assembly 12. A plurality of additional interfaces (not shown) may be disposed at various points around the periphery of the first and second portions 12a and 12b of the handle assembly 12 for ultrasonic welding purposes, e.g., energy direction/deflection points. The first and second portions 12a and 12b (as well as the other components described below) may be assembled together in any fashion known in the art. For example, alignment pins, snap-like interfaces, tongue and groove interfaces, locking tabs, adhesive ports, may all be utilized either alone or in combination for assembly purposes. In one example embodiment, the elongated shaft assembly 14 comprises a proximal end 50 adapted to mechanically engage the handle assembly 12 and the distal rotation assembly 13; and a distal end 52 adapted to mechanically engage the end effector assembly 26. The elongated shaft assembly 14 comprises an outer tubular sheath 56 and a reciprocating tubular actuating member 58 located within the outer tubular sheath 56. The proximal end of the tubular reciprocating tubular actuating member 58 is mechanically engaged to the trigger 32 of the handle assembly 12 to move in either direction 60A or 60B in response to the actuation and/or release of the trigger 32. The pivotably moveable trigger 32 may generate reciprocating motion along the longitudinal axis “T.” Such motion may be used, for example, to actuate the jaws or clamping mechanism of the end effector assembly 26. A series of linkages translate the pivotal rotation of the trigger 32 to axial movement of a yoke coupled to an actuation mechanism, which controls the opening and closing of the jaws of the clamping mechanism of the end effector assembly 26. The distal end of the tubular reciprocating tubular actuating member 58 is mechanically engaged to the end effector assembly 26. In the illustrated embodiment, the distal end of the tubular reciprocating tubular actuating member 58 is mechanically engaged to a clamp arm assembly 64, which is pivotable about a pivot point 70, to open and close the clamp arm assembly 64 in response to the actuation and/or release of the trigger 32. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the clamp arm assembly 64 is movable in direction 62A from an open position to a closed position about a pivot point 70 when the trigger 32 is squeezed in direction 33A. The clamp arm assembly 64 is movable in direction 62B from a closed position to an open position about the pivot point 70 when the trigger 32 is released or outwardly contacted in direction 33B. In one example embodiment, the end effector assembly 26 is attached at the distal end 52 of the elongated shaft assembly 14 and includes a clamp arm assembly 64 and a blade 66. The jaws of the clamping mechanism of the end effector assembly 26 are formed by clamp arm assembly 64 and the blade 66. The blade 66 is ultrasonically actuatable and is acoustically coupled to the ultrasonic transducer 16. The trigger 32 on the handle assembly 12 is ultimately connected to a drive assembly, which together, mechanically cooperate to effect movement of the clamp arm assembly 64. Squeezing the trigger 32 in direction 33A moves the clamp arm assembly 64 in direction 62A from an open position, wherein the clamp arm assembly 64 and the blade 66 are disposed in a spaced relation relative to one another, to a clamped or closed position, wherein the clamp arm assembly 64 and the blade 66 cooperate to grasp tissue therebetween. The clamp arm assembly 64 may comprise a clamp pad (not shown) to engage tissue between the blade 66 and the clamp arm 64. Releasing the trigger 32 in direction 33B moves the clamp arm assembly 64 in direction 62B from a closed relationship, to an open position, wherein the clamp arm assembly 64 and the blade 66 are disposed in a spaced relation relative to one another. The proximal portion of the handle assembly 12 comprises a proximal opening 68 to receive the distal end of the ultrasonic assembly 16. The ultrasonic assembly 16 is inserted in the proximal opening 68 and is mechanically engaged to the elongated shaft assembly 14. In one example embodiment, the elongated trigger hook 36 portion of the trigger 32 provides a longer trigger lever with a shorter span and rotation travel. The longer lever of the elongated trigger hook 36 allows the user to employ multiple fingers within the aperture 38 to operate the elongated trigger hook 36 and cause the trigger 32 to pivot in direction 33B to open the jaws of the end effector assembly 26. For example, the user may insert three fingers (e.g., the middle, ring, and little fingers) in the aperture 38. Multiple fingers allows the surgeon to exert higher input forces on the trigger 32 and the elongated trigger hook 36 to activate the end effector assembly 26. The shorter span and rotation travel creates a more comfortable grip when closing or squeezing the trigger 32 in direction 33A or when opening the trigger 32 in the outward opening motion in direction 33B lessening the need to extend the fingers further outward. This substantially lessens hand fatigue and strain associated with the outward opening motion of the trigger 32 in direction 33B. The outward opening motion of the trigger may be spring-assisted by spring element 98 (FIG. 5) to help alleviate fatigue. The opening spring force is sufficient to assist the ease of opening, but not strong enough to adversely impact the tactile feedback of tissue tension during spreading dissection. For example, during a surgical procedure the index finger may be used to control the rotation of the elongated endoscopic shaft assembly 14 to locate the jaws of the end effector assembly 26 in a suitable orientation. The middle and/or the other lower fingers may be used to squeeze the trigger 32 and grasp tissue within the jaws. Once the jaws are located in the desired position and the jaws are clamped against the tissue, the index finger can be used to activate the toggle switch 30 to adjust the power level of the ultrasonic transducer 16 to treat the tissue. Once the tissue has been treated, the user may release the trigger 32 by pushing outwardly in the distal direction against the elongated trigger hook 36 with the middle and/or lower fingers to open the jaws of the end effector assembly 26. This basic procedure may be performed without the user having to adjust their grip of the handle assembly 12. FIGS. 3-4 illustrate the connection of the elongated shaft assembly 14 relative to the end effector assembly 26. As previously described, in the illustrated embodiment, the end effector assembly 26 comprises a clamp arm assembly 64 and a blade 66 to form the jaws of the clamping mechanism. The blade 66 may be an ultrasonically actuatable blade acoustically coupled to the ultrasonic transducer 16. The trigger 32 is mechanically connected to a drive assembly. Together, the trigger 32 and the drive assembly mechanically cooperate to move the clamp arm assembly 64 to an open position in direction 62A wherein the clamp arm assembly 64 and the blade 66 are disposed in spaced relation relative to one another, to a clamped or closed position in direction 62B wherein the clamp arm assembly 64 and the blade 66 cooperate to grasp tissue therebetween. The clamp arm assembly 64 may comprise a clamp pad (not shown) to engage tissue between the blade 66 and the clamp arm 64. The distal end of the tubular reciprocating tubular actuating member 58 is mechanically engaged to the end effector assembly 26. In the illustrated embodiment, the distal end of the tubular reciprocating tubular actuating member 58 is mechanically engaged to the clamp arm assembly 64, which is pivotable about the pivot point 70, to open and close the clamp arm assembly 64 in response to the actuation and/or release of the trigger 32. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the clamp arm assembly 64 is movable from an open position to a closed position in direction 62B about a pivot point 70 when the trigger 32 is squeezed in direction 33A. The clamp arm assembly 64 is movable from a closed position to an open position in direction 62A about the pivot point 70 when the trigger 32 is released or outwardly contacted in direction 33B. As previously discussed, the clamp arm assembly 64 may comprise electrodes electrically coupled to the electrosurgical/RF generator module 23 to receive therapeutic and/or sub-therapeutic energy, where the electrosurgical/RF energy may be applied to the electrodes either simultaneously or non-simultaneously with the ultrasonic energy being applied to the blade 66. Such energy activations may be applied in any suitable combinations to achieve a desired tissue effect in cooperation with an algorithm or other control logic. FIG. 5 is an exploded view of the ultrasonic surgical instrument 10 shown in FIG. 2. In the illustrated embodiment, the exploded view shows the internal elements of the handle assembly 12, the handle assembly 12, the distal rotation assembly 13, the switch assembly 28, and the elongated endoscopic shaft assembly 14. In the illustrated embodiment, the first and second portions 12a, 12b mate to form the handle assembly 12. The first and second portions 12a, 12b each comprises a plurality of interfaces 69 dimensioned to mechanically align and engage one another to form the handle assembly 12 and enclose the internal working components of the ultrasonic surgical instrument 10. The rotation knob 48 is mechanically engaged to the outer tubular sheath 56 so that it may be rotated in circular direction 54 up to 360°. The outer tubular sheath 56 is located over the reciprocating tubular actuating member 58, which is mechanically engaged to and retained within the handle assembly 12 via a plurality of coupling elements 72. The coupling elements 72 may comprise an O-ring 72a, a tube collar cap 72b, a distal washer 72c, a proximal washer 72d, and a thread tube collar 72e. The reciprocating tubular actuating member 58 is located within a reciprocating yoke 84, which is retained between the first and second portions 12a, 12b of the handle assembly 12. The yoke 84 is part of a reciprocating yoke assembly 88. A series of linkages translate the pivotal rotation of the elongated trigger hook 32 to the axial movement of the reciprocating yoke 84, which controls the opening and closing of the jaws of the clamping mechanism of the end effector assembly 26 at the distal end of the ultrasonic surgical instrument 10. In one example embodiment, a four-link design provides mechanical advantage in a relatively short rotation span, for example. In one example embodiment, an ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 is disposed inside the reciprocating tubular actuating member 58. The distal end 52 of the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 is acoustically coupled (e.g., directly or indirectly mechanically coupled) to the blade 66 and the proximal end 50 of the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 is received within the handle assembly 12. The proximal end 50 of the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 is adapted to acoustically couple to the distal end of the ultrasonic transducer 16 as discussed in more detail below. The ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 is isolated from the other elements of the elongated shaft assembly 14 by a protective sheath 80 and a plurality of isolation elements 82, such as silicone rings. The outer tubular sheath 56, the reciprocating tubular actuating member 58, and the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 are mechanically engaged by a pin 74. The switch assembly 28 comprises the toggle switch 30 and electrical elements 86a,b to electrically energize the ultrasonic transducer 16 in accordance with the activation of the first or second projecting knobs 30a, 30b. In one example embodiment, the outer tubular sheath 56 isolates the user or the patient from the ultrasonic vibrations of the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78. The outer tubular sheath 56 generally includes a hub 76. The outer tubular sheath 56 is threaded onto the distal end of the handle assembly 12. The ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 extends through the opening of the outer tubular sheath 56 and the isolation elements 82 isolate the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 from the outer tubular sheath 56. The outer tubular sheath 56 may be attached to the waveguide 78 with the pin 74. The hole to receive the pin 74 in the waveguide 78 may occur nominally at a displacement node. The waveguide 78 may screw or snap into the hand piece handle assembly 12 by a stud. Flat portions on the hub 76 may allow the assembly to be torqued to a required level. In one example embodiment, the hub 76 portion of the outer tubular sheath 56 is preferably constructed from plastic and the tubular elongated portion of the outer tubular sheath 56 is fabricated from stainless steel. Alternatively, the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 may comprise polymeric material surrounding it to isolate it from outside contact. In one example embodiment, the distal end of the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 may be coupled to the proximal end of the blade 66 by an internal threaded connection, preferably at or near an antinode. It is contemplated that the blade 66 may be attached to the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 by any suitable means, such as a welded joint or the like. Although the blade 66 may be detachable from the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78, it is also contemplated that the single element end effector (e.g., the blade 66) and the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 may be formed as a single unitary piece. In one example embodiment, the trigger 32 is coupled to a linkage mechanism to translate the rotational motion of the trigger 32 in directions 33A and 33B to the linear motion of the reciprocating tubular actuating member 58 in corresponding directions 60A and 60B. The trigger 32 comprises a first set of flanges 97 with openings formed therein to receive a first yoke pin 94a. The first yoke pin 94a is also located through a set of openings formed at the distal end of the yoke 84. The trigger 32 also comprises a second set of flanges 96 to receive a first end 92a of a link 92. A trigger pin 90 is received in openings formed in the link 92 and the second set of flanges 96. The trigger pin 90 is received in the openings formed in the link 92 and the second set of flanges 96 and is adapted to couple to the first and second portions 12a, 12b of the handle assembly 12 to form a trigger pivot point for the trigger 32. A second end 92b of the link 92 is received in a slot 93 formed in a proximal end of the yoke 84 and is retained therein by a second yoke pin 94b. As the trigger 32 is pivotally rotated about the pivot point 190 formed by the trigger pin 90, the yoke translates horizontally along longitudinal axis “T” in a direction indicated by arrows 60A,B. FIG. 8 illustrates one example embodiment of an ultrasonic surgical instrument 10. In the illustrated embodiment, a cross-sectional view of the ultrasonic transducer 16 is shown within a partial cutaway view of the handle assembly 12. One example embodiment of the ultrasonic surgical instrument 10 comprises the ultrasonic signal generator 20 coupled to the ultrasonic transducer 16, comprising a hand piece housing 99, and an ultrasonically actuatable single or multiple element end effector assembly 26. As previously discussed, the end effector assembly 26 comprises the ultrasonically actuatable blade 66 and the clamp arm 64. The ultrasonic transducer 16, which is known as a “Langevin stack”, generally includes a transduction portion 100, a first resonator portion or end-bell 102, and a second resonator portion or fore-bell 104, and ancillary components. The total construction of these components is a resonator. The ultrasonic transducer 16 is preferably an integral number of one-half system wavelengths (nλ/2; where “n” is any positive integer; e.g., n=1, 2, 3 . . . ) in length as will be described in more detail later. An acoustic assembly 106 includes the ultrasonic transducer 16, a nose cone 108, a velocity transformer 118, and a surface 110. In one example embodiment, the distal end of the end-bell 102 is connected to the proximal end of the transduction portion 100, and the proximal end of the fore-bell 104 is connected to the distal end of the transduction portion 100. The fore-bell 104 and the end-bell 102 have a length determined by a number of variables, including the thickness of the transduction portion 100, the density and modulus of elasticity of the material used to manufacture the end-bell 102 and the fore-bell 22, and the resonant frequency of the ultrasonic transducer 16. The fore-bell 104 may be tapered inwardly from its proximal end to its distal end to amplify the ultrasonic vibration amplitude as the velocity transformer 118, or alternately may have no amplification. A suitable vibrational frequency range may be about 20 Hz to 32 kHz and a well-suited vibrational frequency range may be about 30-10 kHz. A suitable operational vibrational frequency may be approximately 55.5 kHz, for example. In one example embodiment, the piezoelectric elements 112 may be fabricated from any suitable material, such as, for example, lead zirconate-titanate, lead meta-niobate, lead titanate, barium titanate, or other piezoelectric ceramic material. Each of positive electrodes 114, negative electrodes 116, and the piezoelectric elements 112 has a bore extending through the center. The positive and negative electrodes 114 and 116 are electrically coupled to wires 120 and 122, respectively. The wires 120 and 122 are encased within the cable 22 and electrically connectable to the ultrasonic signal generator 20. The ultrasonic transducer 16 of the acoustic assembly 106 converts the electrical signal from the ultrasonic signal generator 20 into mechanical energy that results in primarily a standing acoustic wave of longitudinal vibratory motion of the ultrasonic transducer 16 and the blade 66 portion of the end effector assembly 26 at ultrasonic frequencies. In another embodiment, the vibratory motion of the ultrasonic transducer may act in a different direction. For example, the vibratory motion may comprise a local longitudinal component of a more complicated motion of the tip of the elongated shaft assembly 14. A suitable generator is available as model number GEN11, from Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio. When the acoustic assembly 106 is energized, a vibratory motion standing wave is generated through the acoustic assembly 106. The ultrasonic surgical instrument 10 is designed to operate at a resonance such that an acoustic standing wave pattern of predetermined amplitude is produced. The amplitude of the vibratory motion at any point along the acoustic assembly 106 depends upon the location along the acoustic assembly 106 at which the vibratory motion is measured. A minimum or zero crossing in the vibratory motion standing wave is generally referred to as a node (i.e., where motion is minimal), and a local absolute value maximum or peak in the standing wave is generally referred to as an anti-node (e.g., where local motion is maximal). The distance between an anti-node and its nearest node is one-quarter wavelength (λ/4). The wires 120 and 122 transmit an electrical signal from the ultrasonic signal generator 20 to the positive electrodes 114 and the negative electrodes 116. The piezoelectric elements 112 are energized by the electrical signal supplied from the ultrasonic signal generator 20 in response to an actuator 224, such as a foot switch, for example, to produce an acoustic standing wave in the acoustic assembly 106. The electrical signal causes disturbances in the piezoelectric elements 112 in the form of repeated small displacements resulting in large alternating compression and tension forces within the material. The repeated small displacements cause the piezoelectric elements 112 to expand and contract in a continuous manner along the axis of the voltage gradient, producing longitudinal waves of ultrasonic energy. The ultrasonic energy is transmitted through the acoustic assembly 106 to the blade 66 portion of the end effector assembly 26 via a transmission component or an ultrasonic transmission waveguide portion 78 of the elongated shaft assembly 14. In one example embodiment, in order for the acoustic assembly 106 to deliver energy to the blade 66 portion of the end effector assembly 26, all components of the acoustic assembly 106 must be acoustically coupled to the blade 66. The distal end of the ultrasonic transducer 16 may be acoustically coupled at the surface 110 to the proximal end of the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 by a threaded connection such as a stud 124. In one example embodiment, the components of the acoustic assembly 106 are preferably acoustically tuned such that the length of any assembly is an integral number of one-half wavelengths (nλ/2), where the wavelength λ is the wavelength of a pre-selected or operating longitudinal vibration drive frequency fd of the acoustic assembly 106. It is also contemplated that the acoustic assembly 106 may incorporate any suitable arrangement of acoustic elements. In one example embodiment, the blade 66 may have a length substantially equal to an integral multiple of one-half system wavelengths (nλ/2). A distal end of the blade 66 may be disposed near an antinode in order to provide the maximum longitudinal excursion of the distal end. When the transducer assembly is energized, the distal end of the blade 66 may be configured to move in the range of, for example, approximately 10 to 500 microns peak-to-peak, and preferably in the range of about 30 to 64 microns at a predetermined vibrational frequency of 55 kHz, for example. In one example embodiment, the blade 66 may be coupled to the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78. The blade 66 and the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 as illustrated are formed as a single unit construction from a material suitable for transmission of ultrasonic energy. Examples of such materials include Ti6Al4V (an alloy of Titanium including Aluminum and Vanadium), Aluminum, Stainless Steel, or other suitable materials. Alternately, the blade 66 may be separable (and of differing composition) from the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78, and coupled by, for example, a stud, weld, glue, quick connect, or other suitable known methods. The length of the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 may be substantially equal to an integral number of one-half wavelengths (nλ/2), for example. The ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 may be preferably fabricated from a solid core shaft constructed out of material suitable to propagate ultrasonic energy efficiently, such as the titanium alloy discussed above (i.e., Ti6Al4V) or any suitable aluminum alloy, or other alloys, for example. In one example embodiment, the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 comprises a longitudinally projecting attachment post at a proximal end to couple to the surface 110 of the ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 by a threaded connection such as the stud 124. The ultrasonic transmission waveguide 78 may include a plurality of stabilizing silicone rings or compliant supports 82 (FIG. 5) positioned at a plurality of nodes. The silicone rings 82 dampen undesirable vibration and isolate the ultrasonic energy from an outer protective sheath 80 (FIG. 5) assuring the flow of ultrasonic energy in a longitudinal direction to the distal end of the blade 66 with maximum efficiency. FIG. 9 illustrates one example embodiment of the proximal rotation assembly 128. In the illustrated embodiment, the proximal rotation assembly 128 comprises the proximal rotation knob 134 inserted over the cylindrical hub 135. The proximal rotation knob 134 comprises a plurality of radial projections 138 that are received in corresponding slots 130 formed on a proximal end of the cylindrical hub 135. The proximal rotation knob 134 defines an opening 142 to receive the distal end of the ultrasonic transducer 16. The radial projections 138 are formed of a soft polymeric material and define a diameter that is undersized relative to the outside diameter of the ultrasonic transducer 16 to create a friction interference fit when the distal end of the ultrasonic transducer 16. The polymeric radial projections 138 protrude radially into the opening 142 to form “gripper” ribs that firmly grip the exterior housing of the ultrasonic transducer 16. Therefore, the proximal rotation knob 134 securely grips the ultrasonic transducer 16. The distal end of the cylindrical hub 135 comprises a circumferential lip 132 and a circumferential bearing surface 140. The circumferential lip engages a groove formed in the housing 12 and the circumferential bearing surface 140 engages the housing 12. Thus, the cylindrical hub 135 is mechanically retained within the two housing portions (not shown) of the housing 12. The circumferential lip 132 of the cylindrical hub 135 is located or “trapped” between the first and second housing portions 12a, 12b and is free to rotate in place within the groove. The circumferential bearing surface 140 bears against interior portions of the housing to assist proper rotation. Thus, the cylindrical hub 135 is free to rotate in place within the housing. The user engages the flutes 136 formed on the proximal rotation knob 134 with either the finger or the thumb to rotate the cylindrical hub 135 within the housing 12. In one example embodiment, the cylindrical hub 135 may be formed of a durable plastic such as polycarbonate. In one example embodiment, the cylindrical hub 135 may be formed of a siliconized polycarbonate material. In one example embodiment, the proximal rotation knob 134 may be formed of pliable, resilient, flexible polymeric materials including Versaflex® TPE alloys made by GLS Corporation, for example. The proximal rotation knob 134 may be formed of elastomeric materials, thermoplastic rubber known as Santoprene®, other thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs), or elastomers, for example. The embodiments, however, are not limited in this context. FIG. 10 illustrates one example embodiment of a surgical system 200 including a surgical instrument 210 having single element end effector 278. The system 200 may include a transducer assembly 216 coupled to the end effector 278 and a sheath 256 positioned around the proximal portions of the end effector 278 as shown. The transducer assembly 216 and end effector 278 may operate in a manner similar to that of the transducer assembly 16 and end effector 18 described above to produce ultrasonic energy that may be transmitted to tissue via blade 226. FIGS. 11-18C illustrate various embodiments of surgical instruments that utilize therapeutic and/or subtherapeutic electrical energy to treat tissue or provide feedback to the generators (e.g., electrosurgical instruments). The embodiments of FIGS. 11-18C are adapted for use in a manual or hand-operated manner, although electrosurgical instruments may be utilized in robotic applications as well. FIG. 11 is a perspective view of one example embodiment of a surgical instrument system 300 comprising an electrical energy surgical instrument 310. The electrosurgical instrument 310 may comprise a proximal handle 312, a distal working end or end effector 326 and an introducer or elongated shaft 314 disposed in-between. The electrosurgical system 300 can be configured to supply energy, such as electrical energy, ultrasonic energy, heat energy, or any combination thereof, to the tissue of a patient either independently or simultaneously as described, for example, in connection with FIG. 1, for example. In one example embodiment, the electrosurgical system 300 includes a generator 320 in electrical communication with the electrosurgical instrument 310. The generator 320 is connected to electrosurgical instrument 310 via a suitable transmission medium such as a cable 322. In one example embodiment, the generator 320 is coupled to a controller, such as a control unit 325, for example. In various embodiments, the control unit 325 may be formed integrally with the generator 320 or may be provided as a separate circuit module or device electrically coupled to the generator 320 (shown in phantom as 325′ to illustrate this option). Although in the presently disclosed embodiment, the generator 320 is shown separate from the electrosurgical instrument 310, in one example embodiment, the generator 320 (and/or the control unit 325) may be formed integrally with the electrosurgical instrument 310 to form a unitary electrosurgical system 300, where a battery located within the electrosurgical instrument 310 is the energy source and a circuit coupled to the battery produces the suitable electrical energy, ultrasonic energy, or heat energy. One such example is described herein below in connection with FIGS. 17-18C. The generator 320 may comprise an input device 335 located on a front panel of the generator 320 console. The input device 335 may comprise any suitable device that generates signals suitable for programming the operation of the generator 320, such as a keyboard, or input port, for example. In one example embodiment, various electrodes in the first jaw 364A and the second jaw 364B may be coupled to the generator 320. The cable 322 may comprise multiple electrical conductors for the application of electrical energy to positive (+) and negative (−) electrodes of the electrosurgical instrument 310. The control unit 325 may be used to activate the generator 320, which may serve as an electrical source. In various embodiments, the generator 320 may comprise an RF source, an ultrasonic source, a direct current source, and/or any other suitable type of electrical energy source, for example, which may be activated independently or simultaneously. In various embodiments, the electrosurgical system 300 may comprise at least one supply conductor 331 and at least one return conductor 333, wherein current can be supplied to electrosurgical instrument 300 via the supply conductor 331 and wherein the current can flow back to the generator 320 via the return conductor 333. In various embodiments, the supply conductor 331 and the return conductor 333 may comprise insulated wires and/or any other suitable type of conductor. In certain embodiments, as described below, the supply conductor 331 and the return conductor 333 may be contained within and/or may comprise the cable 322 extending between, or at least partially between, the generator 320 and the end effector 326 of the electrosurgical instrument 310. In any event, the generator 320 can be configured to apply a sufficient voltage differential between the supply conductor 331 and the return conductor 333 such that sufficient current can be supplied to the end effector 110. FIG. 12 is a side view of one example embodiment of the handle 312 of the surgical instrument 310. In FIG. 12, the handle 312 is shown with half of a first handle body 312A (see FIG. 11) removed to illustrate various components within second handle body 312B. The handle 312 may comprise a lever arm 321 (e.g., a trigger) which may be pulled along a path 33. The lever arm 321 may be coupled to an axially moveable member 378 (FIGS. 13-16) disposed within elongated shaft 314 by a shuttle 384 operably engaged to an extension 398 of lever arm 321. The shuttle 384 may further be connected to a biasing device, such as a spring 388, which may also be connected to the second handle body 312B, to bias the shuttle 384 and thus the axially moveable member 378 in a proximal direction, thereby urging the jaws 364A and 364B to an open position as seen in FIG. 11. Also, referring to FIGS. 11-12, a locking member 190 (see FIG. 12) may be moved by a locking switch 328 (see FIG. 11) between a locked position, where the shuttle 384 is substantially prevented from moving distally as illustrated, and an unlocked position, where the shuttle 384 may be allowed to freely move in the distal direction, toward the elongated shaft 314. In some embodiments, the locking switch 328 may be implemented as a button. The handle 312 can be any type of pistol-grip or other type of handle known in the art that is configured to carry actuator levers, triggers or sliders for actuating the first jaw 364A and the second jaw 364B. The elongated shaft 314 may have a cylindrical or rectangular cross-section, for example, and can comprise a thin-wall tubular sleeve that extends from handle 312. The elongated shaft 314 may include a bore extending therethrough for carrying actuator mechanisms, for example, the axially moveable member 378, for actuating the jaws and for carrying electrical leads for delivery of electrical energy to electrosurgical components of the end effector 326. The end effector 326 may be adapted for capturing and transecting tissue and for the contemporaneously welding the captured tissue with controlled application of energy (e.g., RF energy). The first jaw 364A and the second jaw 364B may close to thereby capture or engage tissue about a longitudinal axis “T” defined by the axially moveable member 378. The first jaw 364A and second jaw 364B may also apply compression to the tissue. In some embodiments, the elongated shaft 314, along with first jaw 364A and second jaw 364B, can be rotated a full 360° degrees, as shown by arrow 196 (see FIG. 11), relative to handle 312. For example, a rotation knob 348 may be rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the shaft 314 and may be coupled to the shaft 314 such that rotation of the knob 348 causes corresponding rotation of the shaft 314. The first jaw 364A and the second jaw 364B can remain openable and/or closeable while rotated. FIG. 13 shows a perspective view of one example embodiment of the end effector 326 with the jaws 364A, 364B open, while FIG. 14 shows a perspective view of one embodiment of the end effector 326 with the jaws 364A, 364B closed. As noted above, the end effector 326 may comprise the upper first jaw 364A and the lower second jaw 364B, which may be straight or curved. The first jaw 364A and the second jaw 364B may each comprise an elongated slot or channel 362A and 362B, respectively, disposed outwardly along their respective middle portions. Further, the first jaw 364A and second jaw 364B may each have tissue-gripping elements, such as teeth 363, disposed on the inner portions of first jaw 364A and second jaw 364B. The first jaw 364A may comprise an upper first outward-facing surface 369A and an upper first energy delivery surface 365A. The second jaw 364B may comprise a lower second outward-facing surface 369B and a lower second energy delivery surface 365B. The first energy delivery surface 365A and the second energy delivery surface 365B may both extend in a “U” shape about the distal end of the end effector 326. The lever arm 321 of the handle 312 (FIG. 12) may be adapted to actuate the axially moveable member 378, which may also function as a jaw-closing mechanism. For example, the axially moveable member 378 may be urged distally as the lever arm 321 is pulled proximally along the path 33 via the shuttle 384, as shown in FIG. 12 and discussed above. FIG. 15 is a perspective view of one example embodiment of the axially moveable member 378 of the surgical instrument 310. The axially moveable member 378 may comprise one or several pieces, but in any event, may be movable or translatable with respect to the elongated shaft 314 and/or the jaws 364A, 364B. Also, in at least one example embodiment, the axially moveable member 378 may be made of 17-4 precipitation hardened stainless steel. The distal end of axially moveable member 378 may comprise a flanged “I”-beam configured to slide within the channels 362A and 362B in jaws 364A and 364B. The axially moveable member 378 may slide within the channels 362A, 362B to open and close the first jaw 364A and the second jaw 364B. The distal end of the axially moveable member 378 may also comprise an upper flange or “c”—shaped portion 378A and a lower flange or “c”-shaped portion 378B. The flanges 378A and 378B respectively define inner cam surfaces 367A and 367B for engaging outward facing surfaces of the first jaw 364A and the second jaw 364B. The opening-closing of jaws 364A and 364B can apply very high compressive forces on tissue using cam mechanisms which may include movable “I-beam” axially moveable member 378 and the outward facing surfaces 369A, 369B of jaws 364A, 364B. More specifically, referring now to FIGS. 13-15, collectively, the inner cam surfaces 367A and 367B of the distal end of axially moveable member 378 may be adapted to slidably engage the first outward-facing surface 369A and the second outward-facing surface 369B of the first jaw 364A and the second jaw 364B, respectively. The channel 362A within first jaw 364A and the channel 362B within the second jaw 364B may be sized and configured to accommodate the movement of the axially moveable member 378, which may comprise a tissue-cutting element 371, for example, comprising a sharp distal edge. FIG. 14, for example, shows the distal end of the axially moveable member 378 advanced at least partially through channels 362A and 362B (FIG. 13). The advancement of the axially moveable member 378 may close the end effector 326 from the open configuration shown in FIG. 13. In the closed position shown by FIG. 14, the upper first jaw 364A and lower second jaw 364B define a gap or dimension D between the first energy delivery surface 365A and second energy delivery surface 365B of first jaw 364A and second jaw 364B, respectively. In various embodiments, dimension D can equal from about 0.0005″ to about 0.040″, for example, and in some embodiments, between about 0.001″ to about 0.010″, for example. Also, the edges of the first energy delivery surface 365A and the second energy delivery surface 365B may be rounded to prevent the dissection of tissue. FIG. 16 is a section view of one example embodiment of the end effector 326 of the surgical instrument 310. The engagement, or tissue-contacting, surface 365B of the lower jaw 364B is adapted to deliver energy to tissue, at least in part, through a conductive-resistive matrix, such as a variable resistive positive temperature coefficient (PTC) body, as discussed in more detail below. At least one of the upper and lower jaws 364A, 364B may carry at least one electrode 373 configured to deliver the energy from the generator 320 to the captured tissue. The engagement, or tissue-contacting, surface 365A of upper jaw 364A may carry a similar conductive-resistive matrix (i.e., a PTC material), or in some embodiments the surface may be a conductive electrode or an insulative layer, for example. Alternatively, the engagement surfaces of the jaws can carry any of the energy delivery components disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,773,409, filed Oct. 22, 2001, entitled ELECTROSURGICAL JAW STRUCTURE FOR CONTROLLED ENERGY DELIVERY, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The first energy delivery surface 365A and the second energy delivery surface 365B may each be in electrical communication with the generator 320. The first energy delivery surface 365A and the second energy delivery surface 365B may be configured to contact tissue and deliver electrosurgical energy to captured tissue which are adapted to seal or weld the tissue. The control unit 325 regulates the electrical energy delivered by electrical generator 320 which in turn delivers electrosurgical energy to the first energy delivery surface 365A and the second energy delivery surface 365B. The energy delivery may be initiated by an activation button 328 (FIG. 12) operably engaged with the lever arm 321 and in electrical communication with the generator 320 via cable 322. In one example embodiment, the electrosurgical instrument 310 may be energized by the generator 320 by way of a foot switch 329 (FIG. 11). When actuated, the foot switch 329 triggers the generator 320 to deliver electrical energy to the end effector 326, for example. The control unit 325 may regulate the power generated by the generator 320 during activation. Although the foot switch 329 may be suitable in many circumstances, other suitable types of switches can be used. As mentioned above, the electrosurgical energy delivered by electrical generator 320 and regulated, or otherwise controlled, by the control unit 325 may comprise radio frequency (RF) energy, or other suitable forms of electrical energy. Further, the opposing first and second energy delivery surfaces 365A and 365B may carry variable resistive positive temperature coefficient (PTC) bodies that are in electrical communication with the generator 320 and the control unit 325. Additional details regarding electrosurgical end effectors, jaw closing mechanisms, and electrosurgical energy-delivery surfaces are described in the following U.S. patents and published patent applications: U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,087,054; 7,083,619; 7,070,597; 7,041,102; 7,011,657; 6,929,644; 6,926,716; 6,913,579; 6,905,497; 6,802,843; 6,770,072; 6,656,177; 6,533,784; and 6,500,312; and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. Nos. 2010/0036370 and 2009/0076506, all of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference and made a part of this specification. In one example embodiment, the generator 320 may be implemented as an electrosurgery unit (ESU) capable of supplying power sufficient to perform bipolar electrosurgery using radio frequency (RF) energy. In one example embodiment, the ESU can be a bipolar ERBE ICC 350 sold by ERBE USA, Inc. of Marietta, Ga. In some embodiments, such as for bipolar electrosurgery applications, a surgical instrument having an active electrode and a return electrode can be utilized, wherein the active electrode and the return electrode can be positioned against, adjacent to and/or in electrical communication with, the tissue to be treated such that current can flow from the active electrode, through the positive temperature coefficient (PTC) bodies and to the return electrode through the tissue. Thus, in various embodiments, the electrosurgical system 300 may comprise a supply path and a return path, wherein the captured tissue being treated completes, or closes, the circuit. In one example embodiment, the generator 320 may be a monopolar RF ESU and the electrosurgical instrument 310 may comprise a monopolar end effector 326 in which one or more active electrodes are integrated. For such a system, the generator 320 may require a return pad in intimate contact with the patient at a location remote from the operative site and/or other suitable return path. The return pad may be connected via a cable to the generator 320. In other embodiments, the operator 20 may provide subtherapeutic RF energy levels for purposes of evaluating tissue conditions and providing feedback n the electrosurgical system 300. Such feed back may be employed to control the therapeutic RF energy output of the electrosurgical instrument 310. During operation of electrosurgical instrument 300, the user generally grasps tissue, supplies energy to the captured tissue to form a weld or a seal (e.g., by actuating button 328 and/or pedal 216), and then drives a tissue-cutting element 371 at the distal end of the axially moveable member 378 through the captured tissue. According to various embodiments, the translation of the axial movement of the axially moveable member 378 may be paced, or otherwise controlled, to aid in driving the axially moveable member 378 at a suitable rate of travel. By controlling the rate of the travel, the likelihood that the captured tissue has been properly and functionally sealed prior to transection with the cutting element 371 is increased. FIG. 17 is a perspective view of one example embodiment of a surgical instrument system comprising a cordless electrical energy surgical instrument 410. The electrosurgical system is similar to the electrosurgical system 300. The electrosurgical system can be configured to supply energy, such as electrical energy, ultrasonic energy, heat energy, or any combination thereof, to the tissue of a patient either independently or simultaneously as described in connection with FIGS. 1 and 11, for example. The electrosurgical instrument may utilize the end effector 326 and elongated shaft 314 described here in conjunction with a cordless proximal handle 412. In one example embodiment, the handle 412 includes a generator circuit 420 (see FIG. 18A). The generator circuit 420 performs a function substantially similar to that of generator 320. In one example embodiment, the generator circuit 420 is coupled to a controller, such as a control circuit. In the illustrated embodiment, the control circuit is integrated into the generator circuit 420. In other embodiments, the control circuit may be separate from the generator circuit 420. In one example embodiment, various electrodes in the end effector 326 (including jaws 364A, 364B thereof) may be coupled to the generator circuit 420. The control circuit may be used to activate the generator 420, which may serve as an electrical source. In various embodiments, the generator 420 may comprise an RF source, an ultrasonic source, a direct current source, and/or any other suitable type of electrical energy source, for example. In one example embodiment, a button 328 may be provided to activate the generator circuit 420 to provide energy to the end effectors 326, 326. FIG. 18A is a side view of one example embodiment of the handle 412 of the cordless surgical instrument 410. In FIG. 18A, the handle 412 is shown with half of a first handle body removed to illustrate various components within second handle body 434. The handle 412 may comprise a lever arm 424 (e.g., a trigger) which may be pulled along a path 33 around a pivot point. The lever arm 424 may be coupled to an axially moveable member 478 disposed within elongated shaft 314 by a shuttle operably engaged to an extension of lever arm 424. In one example embodiment, the lever arm 424 defines a shepherd's hook shape comprising a distal trigger hook 424a and a proximal trigger portion 424b. As illustrated, the distal trigger hook 424a may have a first length while the proximal trigger portion 424 may have a second length with the second length greater than the first length. In one example embodiment, the cordless electrosurgical instrument comprises a battery 437. The battery 437 provides electrical energy to the generator circuit 420. The battery 437 may be any battery suitable for driving the generator circuit 420 at the desired energy levels. In one example embodiment, the battery 437 is a 1030 mAhr, triple-cell Lithium Ion Polymer battery. The battery may be fully charged prior to use in a surgical procedure, and may hold a voltage of about 12.6V. The battery 437 may have two fuses fitted to the cordless electrosurgical instrument 410, arranged in line with each battery terminal. In one example embodiment, a charging port 439 is provided to connect the battery 437 to a DC current source (not shown). The generator circuit 420 may be configured in any suitable manner. In some embodiments, the generator circuit comprises an RF drive and control circuit 440. FIG. 18B illustrates an RF drive and control circuit 440, according to one embodiment. FIG. 18B is a part schematic part block diagram illustrating the RF drive and control circuitry 440 used in this embodiment to generate and control the RF electrical energy supplied to the end effector 326. As will be explained in more detail below, in this embodiment, the drive circuitry 440 is a resonant mode RF amplifier comprising a parallel resonant network on the RF amplifier output and the control circuitry operates to control the operating frequency of the drive signal so that it is maintained at the resonant frequency of the drive circuit, which in turn controls the amount of power supplied to the end effector 326. The way that this is achieved will become apparent from the following description. As shown in FIG. 18B, the RF drive and control circuit 440 comprises the above described battery 437 are arranged to supply, in this example, about 0V and about 12V rails. An input capacitor (Cin) 442 is connected between the 0V and the 12V for providing a low source impedance. A pair of FET switches 443-1 and 443-2 (both of which are N-channel in this embodiment to reduce power losses) is connected in series between the 0V rail and the 12V rail. FET gate drive circuitry 445 is provided that generates two drive signals—one for driving each of the two FETs 443. The FET gate drive circuitry 445 generates drive signals that causes the upper FET (443-1) to be on when the lower FET (443-2) is off and vice versa. This causes the node 447 to be alternately connected to the 12V rail (when the FET 443-1 is switched on) and the 0V rail (when the FET 443-2 is switched on). FIG. 18B also shows the internal parasitic diodes 448-1 and 448-2 of the corresponding FETs 443, which conduct during any periods that the FETs 443 are open. As shown in FIG. 18B, the node 447 is connected to an inductor-inductor resonant circuit 450 formed by inductor Ls 452 and inductor Lm 454. The FET gate driving circuitry 445 is arranged to generate drive signals at a drive frequency (fd) that opens and crosses the FET switches 443 at the resonant frequency of the parallel resonant circuit 450. As a result of the resonant characteristic of the resonant circuit 450, the square wave voltage at node 447 will cause a substantially sinusoidal current at the drive frequency (fd) to flow within the resonant circuit 450. As illustrated in FIG. 18B, the inductor Lm 454 is the primary of a transformer 455, the secondary of which is formed by inductor Lsec 456. The inductor Lsec 456 of the transformer 455 secondary is connected to an inductor-capacitor-capacitor parallel resonant circuit 457 formed by inductor L2 458, capacitor C4 460, and capacitor C2 462. The transformer 455 up-converts the drive voltage (Vd) across the inductor Lm 454 to the voltage that is applied to the output parallel resonant circuit 457. The load voltage (VL) is output by the parallel resonant circuit 457 and is applied to the load (represented by the load resistance Rload 459 in FIG. 18B) corresponding to the impedance of the forceps' jaws and any tissue or vessel gripped by the end effector 326. As shown in FIG. 18B, a pair of DC blocking capacitors Cbl 480-1 and 480-2 is provided to prevent any DC signal being applied to the load 459. In one embodiment, the transformer 455 may be implemented with a Core Diameter (mm), Wire Diameter (mm), and Gap between secondary windings in accordance with the following specifications: Core Diameter, D (mm) D=19.9×10-3 Wire diameter, W (mm) for 22 AWG wire W=7.366×10-4 Gap between secondary windings, in gap=0.125 G=gap/25.4 In this embodiment, the amount of electrical power supplied to the end effector 326 is controlled by varying the frequency of the switching signals used to switch the FETs 443. This works because the resonant circuit 450 acts as a frequency dependent (loss less) attenuator. The closer the drive signal is to the resonant frequency of the resonant circuit 450, the less the drive signal is attenuated. Similarly, as the frequency of the drive signal is moved away from the resonant frequency of the circuit 450, the more the drive signal is attenuated and so the power supplied to the load reduces. In this embodiment, the frequency of the switching signals generated by the FET gate drive circuitry 445 is controlled by a controller 481 based on a desired power to be delivered to the load 459 and measurements of the load voltage (VL) and of the load current (IL) obtained by conventional voltage sensing circuitry 483 and current sensing circuitry 485. The way that the controller 481 operates will be described in more detail below. In one embodiment, the voltage sensing circuitry 483 and the current sensing circuitry 485 may be implemented with high bandwidth, high speed rail-to-rail amplifiers (e.g., LMH6643 by National Semiconductor). Such amplifiers, however, consume a relatively high current when they are operational. Accordingly, a power save circuit may be provided to reduce the supply voltage of the amplifiers when they are not being used in the voltage sensing circuitry 483 and the current sensing circuitry 485. In one-embodiment, a step-down regulator (e.g., LT3502 by Linear Technologies) may be employed by the power save circuit to reduce the supply voltage of the rail-to-rail amplifiers and thus extend the life of the battery 437. FIG. 18C illustrates the main components of the controller 481, according to one embodiment. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 18C, the controller 481 is a microprocessor based controller and so most of the components illustrated in FIG. 16 are software based components. Nevertheless, a hardware based controller 481 may be used instead. As shown, the controller 481 includes synchronous I,Q sampling circuitry 491 that receives the sensed voltage and current signals from the sensing circuitry 483 and 485 and obtains corresponding samples which are passed to a power, Vrms and Irms calculation module 493. The calculation module 493 uses the received samples to calculate the RMS voltage and RMS current applied to the load 459 (FIG. 18B; end effector 326 and tissue/vessel gripped thereby) and from them the power that is presently being supplied to the load 459. The determined values are then passed to a frequency control module 495 and a medical device control module 497. The medical device control module 497 uses the values to determine the present impedance of the load 459 and based on this determined impedance and a pre-defined algorithm, determines what set point power (Pset) should be applied to the frequency control module 495. The medical device control module 497 is in turn controlled by signals received from a user input module 499 that receives inputs from the user (for example pressing buttons or activating the control levers 114, 110 on the handle 104) and also controls output devices (lights, a display, speaker or the like) on the handle 104 via a user output module 461. The frequency control module 495 uses the values obtained from the calculation module 493 and the power set point (Pset) obtained from the medical device control module 497 and predefined system limits (to be explained below), to determine whether or not to increase or decrease the applied frequency. The result of this decision is then passed to a square wave generation module 463 which, in this embodiment, increments or decrements the frequency of a square wave signal that it generates by 1 kHz, depending on the received decision. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, in an alternative embodiment, the frequency control module 495 may determine not only whether to increase or decrease the frequency, but also the amount of frequency change required. In this case, the square wave generation module 463 would generate the corresponding square wave signal with the desired frequency shift. In this embodiment, the square wave signal generated by the square wave generation module 463 is output to the FET gate drive circuitry 445, which amplifies the signal and then applies it to the FET 443-1. The FET gate drive circuitry 445 also inverts the signal applied to the FET 443-1 and applies the inverted signal to the FET 443-2. The electrosurgical instrument 410 may comprise additional features as discussed with respect to electrosurgical system 300. Those skilled in the art will recognize that electrosurgical instrument 410 may include a rotation knob 348, an elongated shaft 314, and an end effector 326. These elements function in a substantially similar manner to that discussed above with respect to the electrosurgical system 300. In one example embodiment, the cordless electrosurgical instrument 410 may include visual indicators 435. The visual indicators 435 may provide a visual indication signal to an operator. In one example embodiment, the visual indication signal may alert an operator that the device is on, or that the device is applying energy to the end effector. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the visual indicators 435 may be configured to provide information on multiple states of the device. Over the years a variety of minimally invasive robotic (or “telesurgical”) systems have been developed to increase surgical dexterity as well as to permit a surgeon to operate on a patient in an intuitive manner. Robotic surgical systems can be used with many different types of surgical instruments including, for example, ultrasonic or electrosurgical instruments, as described herein. Example robotic systems include those manufactured by Intuitive Surgical, Inc., of Sunnyvale, Calif., U.S.A. Such systems, as well as robotic systems from other manufacturers, are disclosed in the following U.S. patents which are each herein incorporated by reference in their respective entirety: U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,135, entitled “Articulated Surgical Instrument For Performing Minimally Invasive Surgery With Enhanced Dexterity and Sensitivity”, U.S. Pat. No. 6,231,565, entitled “Robotic Arm DLUS For Performing Surgical Tasks”, U.S. Pat. No. 6,783,524, entitled “Robotic Surgical Tool With Ultrasound Cauterizing and Cutting Instrument”, U.S. Pat. No. 6,364,888, entitled “Alignment of Master and Slave In a Minimally Invasive Surgical Apparatus”, U.S. Pat.

No. 7,824,401, entitled “Surgical Tool With Writed Monopolar Electrosurgical End Effectors”. Many of such systems, however, have in the past been unable to generate the magnitude of forces required to effectively cut and fasten tissue. FIGS. 19-46C illustrate example embodiments of robotic surgical systems. In some embodiments, the disclosed robotic surgical systems may utilize the ultrasonic or electrosurgical instruments described herein. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the illustrated robotic surgical systems are not limited to only those instruments described herein, and may utilize any compatible surgical instruments. Those skilled in the art will further appreciate that while various embodiments described herein may be used with the described robotic surgical systems, the disclosure is not so limited, and may be used with any compatible robotic surgical system. FIGS. 19-25 illustrate the structure and operation of several example robotic surgical systems and components thereof. FIG. 19 shows a block diagram of an example robotic surgical system 500. The system 500 comprises at least one controller 508 and at least one arm cart 510. The arm cart 510 may be mechanically coupled to one or more robotic manipulators or arms, indicated by box 512. Each of the robotic arms 512 may comprise one or more surgical instruments 514 for performing various surgical tasks on a patient 504. Operation of the arm cart 510, including the arms 512 and instruments 514 may be directed by a clinician 502 from a controller 508. In some embodiments, a second controller 508′, operated by a second clinician 502′ may also direct operation of the arm cart 510 in conjunction with the first clinician 502′. For example, each of the clinicians 502, 502′ may control different arms 512 of the cart or, in some cases, complete control of the arm cart 510 may be passed between the clinicians 502, 502′. In some embodiments, additional arm carts (not shown) may be utilized on the patient 504. These additional arm carts may be controlled by one or more of the controllers 508, 508′. The arm cart(s) 510 and controllers 508, 508′ may be in communication with one another via a communications link 516, which may be any suitable type of wired or wireless communications link carrying any suitable type of signal (e.g., electrical, optical, infrared, etc.) according to any suitable communications protocol. Example implementations of robotic surgical systems, such as the system 500, are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,524,320 which has been herein incorporated by reference. Thus, various details of such devices will not be described in detail herein beyond that which may be necessary to understand various embodiments of the claimed device. FIG. 20 shows one example embodiment of a robotic arm cart 520. The robotic arm cart 520 is configured to actuate a plurality of surgical instruments or instruments, generally designated as 522 within a work envelope 527. Various robotic surgery systems and methods employing master controller and robotic arm cart arrangements are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,132,368, entitled “Multi-Component Telepresence System and Method”, the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In various forms, the robotic arm cart 520 includes a base 524 from which, in the illustrated embodiment, three surgical instruments 522 are supported. In various forms, the surgical instruments 522 are each supported by a series of manually articulatable linkages, generally referred to as set-up joints 526, and a robotic manipulator 528. These structures are herein illustrated with protective covers extending over much of the robotic linkage. These protective covers may be optional, and may be limited in size or entirely eliminated in some embodiments to minimize the inertia that is encountered by the servo mechanisms used to manipulate such devices, to limit the volume of moving components so as to avoid collisions, and to limit the overall weight of the cart 520. Cart 520 will generally have dimensions suitable for transporting the cart 520 between operating rooms. The cart 520 may be configured to typically fit through standard operating room doors and onto standard hospital elevators. In various forms, the cart 520 would preferably have a weight and include a wheel (or other transportation) system that allows the cart 520 to be positioned adjacent an operating table by a single attendant. FIG. 21 shows one example embodiment of the robotic manipulator 528 of the robotic arm cart 520. In the example shown in FIG. 21, the robotic manipulators 528 may include a linkage 530 that constrains movement of the surgical instrument 522. In various embodiments, linkage 530 includes rigid links coupled together by rotational joints in a parallelogram arrangement so that the surgical instrument 522 rotates around a point in space 532, as more fully described in issued U.S. Pat. No. 5,817,084, the full disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. The parallelogram arrangement constrains rotation to pivoting about an axis 534a, sometimes called the pitch axis. The links supporting the parallelogram linkage are pivotally mounted to set-up joints 526 (FIG. 20) so that the surgical instrument 522 further rotates about an axis 534b, sometimes called the yaw axis. The pitch and yaw axes 534a, 534b intersect at the remote center 536, which is aligned along a shaft 538 of the surgical instrument 522. The surgical instrument 522 may have further degrees of driven freedom as supported by manipulator 540, including sliding motion of the surgical instrument 522 along the longitudinal instrument axis “LT-LT”. As the surgical instrument 522 slides along the instrument axis LT-LT relative to manipulator 540 (arrow 534c), remote center 536 remains fixed relative to base 542 of manipulator 540. Hence, the entire manipulator 540 is generally moved to re-position remote center 536. Linkage 530 of manipulator 540 is driven by a series of motors 544. These motors 544 actively move linkage 530 in response to commands from a processor of a control system. As will be discussed in further detail below, motors 544 are also employed to manipulate the surgical instrument 522. FIG. 22 shows one example embodiment of a robotic arm cart 520′ having an alternative set-up joint structure. In this example embodiment, a surgical instrument 522 is supported by an alternative manipulator structure 528′ between two tissue manipulation instruments. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that various embodiments of the claimed device may incorporate a wide variety of alternative robotic structures, including those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,878,193, the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, while the data communication between a robotic component and the processor of the robotic surgical system is primarily described herein with reference to communication between the surgical instrument 522 and the controller, it should be understood that similar communication may take place between circuitry of a manipulator, a set-up joint, an endoscope or other image capture device, or the like, and the processor of the robotic surgical system for component compatibility verification, component-type identification, component calibration (such as off-set or the like) communication, confirmation of coupling of the component to the robotic surgical system, or the like. FIG. 23 shows one example embodiment of a controller 518 that may be used in conjunction with a robotic arm cart, such as the robotic arm carts 520, 520′ depicted in FIGS. 20-22. The controller 518 generally includes master controllers (generally represented as 519 in FIG. 23) which are grasped by the clinician and manipulated in space while the clinician views the procedure via a stereo display 521. A surgeon feed back meter 515 may be viewed via the display 521 and provide the surgeon with a visual indication of the amount of force being applied to the cutting instrument or dynamic clamping member. The master controllers 519 generally comprise manual input devices which preferably move with multiple degrees of freedom, and which often further have a handle or trigger for actuating tools (for example, for closing grasping saws, applying an electrical potential to an electrode, or the like). FIG. 24 shows one example embodiment of an ultrasonic surgical instrument 522 adapted for use with a robotic surgical system. For example, the surgical instrument 522 may be coupled to one of the surgical manipulators 528, 528′ described hereinabove. As can be seen in FIG. 24, the surgical instrument 522 comprises a surgical end effector 548 that comprises an ultrasonic blade 550 and clamp arm 552, which may be coupled to an elongated shaft assembly 554 that, in some embodiments, may comprise an articulation joint 556. FIG. 25 shows another example embodiment having an electrosurgical instrument 523 in place of the ultrasonic surgical instrument 522. The surgical instrument 523 comprises a surgical end effector 548 that comprises closable jaws 551A, 551B having energy deliver surfaces 553A, 553B for engaging and providing electrical energy to tissue between the jaws 551A, 551B. A tissue cutting element or knife 555 may be positioned at the distal end of an axially movable member 557 that may extend through the elongated shaft assembly 554 to the instrument mounting portion 558. FIG. 26 shows one embodiment of an instrument drive assembly 546 that may be coupled to one of the surgical manipulators 528, 528′ to receive and control the surgical instruments 522, 523. The instrument drive assembly 546 may also be operatively coupled to the controller 518 to receive inputs from the clinician for controlling the instrument 522, 523. For example, actuation (e.g., opening and closing) of the clamp arm 552, actuation (e.g., opening and closing) of the jaws 551A, 551B, actuation of the ultrasonic blade 550, extension of the knife 555 and actuation of the energy delivery surfaces 553A, 553B, etc. may be controlled through the instrument drive assembly 546 based on inputs from the clinician provided through the controller 518. The surgical instrument 522 is operably coupled to the manipulator by an instrument mounting portion, generally designated as 558. The surgical instruments 522 further include an interface 560 which mechanically and electrically couples the instrument mounting portion 558 to the manipulator. FIG. 27 shows another view of the instrument drive assembly of FIG. 26 including the ultrasonic surgical instrument 522. FIG. 28 shows another view of the instrument drive assembly of FIG. 26 including the electrosurgical instrument 523. The instrument mounting portion 558 includes a tool mounting plate 562 that operably supports a plurality of (four are shown in FIG. 26) rotatable body portions, driven discs or elements 564, that each include a pair of pins 566 that extend from a surface of the driven element 564. One pin 566 is closer to an axis of rotation of each driven elements 564 than the other pin 566 on the same driven element 564, which helps to ensure positive angular alignment of the driven element 564. The driven elements 564 and pints 566 may be positioned on an adapter side 567 of the instrument mounting plate 562. Interface 560 also includes an adaptor portion 568 that is configured to mountingly engage the mounting plate 562 as will be further discussed below. The adaptor portion 568 may include an array of electrical connecting pins 570, which may be coupled to a memory structure by a circuit board within the instrument mounting portion 558. While interface 560 is described herein with reference to mechanical, electrical, and magnetic coupling elements, it should be understood that a wide variety of telemetry modalities might be used, including infrared, inductive coupling, or the like. FIGS. 29-31 show additional views of the adapter portion 568 of the instrument drive assembly 546 of FIG. 26. The adapter portion 568 generally includes an instrument side 572 and a holder side 574 (FIG. 29). In various embodiments, a plurality of rotatable bodies 576 are mounted to a floating plate 578 which has a limited range of movement relative to the surrounding adaptor structure normal to the major surfaces of the adaptor 568. Axial movement of the floating plate 578 helps decouple the rotatable bodies 576 from the instrument mounting portion 558 when the levers 580 along the sides of the instrument mounting portion housing 582 are actuated (See FIGS. 24, 25) Other mechanisms/arrangements may be employed for releasably coupling the instrument mounting portion 558 to the adaptor 568. In at least one form, rotatable bodies 576 are resiliently mounted to floating plate 578 by resilient radial members which extend into a circumferential indentation about the rotatable bodies 576. The rotatable bodies 576 can move axially relative to plate 578 by deflection of these resilient structures. When disposed in a first axial position (toward instrument side 572) the rotatable bodies 576 are free to rotate without angular limitation. However, as the rotatable bodies 576 move axially toward instrument side 572, tabs 584 (extending radially from the rotatable bodies 576) laterally engage detents on the floating plates so as to limit angular rotation of the rotatable bodies 576 about their axes. This limited rotation can be used to help drivingly engage the rotatable bodies 576 with drive pins 586 of a corresponding instrument holder portion 588 of the robotic system, as the drive pins 586 will push the rotatable bodies 576 into the limited rotation position until the pins 586 are aligned with (and slide into) openings 590. Openings 590 on the instrument side 572 and openings 590 on the holder side 574 of rotatable bodies 576 are configured to accurately align the driven elements 564 (FIGS. 27, 28) of the instrument mounting portion 558 with the drive elements 592 of the instrument holder 588. As described above regarding inner and outer pins 566 of driven elements 564, the openings 590 are at differing distances from the axis of rotation on their respective rotatable bodies 576 so as to ensure that the alignment is not 33 degrees from its intended position. Additionally, each of the openings 590 may be slightly radially elongated so as to fittingly receive the pins 566 in the circumferential orientation. This allows the pins 566 to slide radially within the openings 590 and accommodate some axial misalignment between the instrument 522, 523 and instrument holder 588, while minimizing any angular misalignment and backlash between the drive and driven elements. Openings 590 on the instrument side 572 may be offset by about 90 degrees from the openings 590 (shown in broken lines) on the holder side 574, as can be seen most clearly in FIG. 31. Various embodiments may further include an array of electrical connector pins 570 located on holder side 574 of adaptor 568, and the instrument side 572 of the adaptor 568 may include slots 594 (FIG. 31) for receiving a pin array (not shown) from the instrument mounting portion 558. In addition to transmitting electrical signals between the surgical instrument 522, 523 and the instrument holder 588, at least some of these electrical connections may be coupled to an adaptor memory device 596 (FIG. 30) by a circuit board of the adaptor 568. A detachable latch arrangement 598 may be employed to releasably affix the adaptor 568 to the tool holder 588. As used herein, the term “instrument drive assembly” when used in the context of the robotic system, at least encompasses various embodiments of the adapter 568 and instrument holder 588 and which has been generally designated as 546 in FIG. 26. For example, as can be seen in FIG. 26, the instrument holder 588 may include a first latch pin arrangement 600 that is sized to be received in corresponding clevis slots 602 provided in the adaptor 568. In addition, the instrument holder 588 may further have second latch pins 604 that are sized to be retained in corresponding latch clevises 606 in the adaptor 568. See FIG. 30. In at least one form, a latch assembly 608 is movably supported on the adapter 568 and is biasable between a first latched position wherein the latch pins 600 are retained within their respective latch clevis 602 and an unlatched position wherein the second latch pins 604 may be into or removed from the latch clevises 606. A spring or springs (not shown) are employed to bias the latch assembly into the latched position. A lip on the instrument side 572 of adaptor 568 may slidably receive laterally extending tabs of instrument mounting housing 582. As described the driven elements 564 may be aligned with the drive elements 592 of the instrument holder 588 such that rotational motion of the drive elements 592 causes corresponding rotational motion of the driven elements 564. The rotation of the drive elements 592 and driven elements 564 may be electronically controlled, for example, via the robotic arm 512, in response to instructions received from the clinician 502 via a controller 508. The instrument mounting portion 558 may translate rotation of the driven elements 564 into motion of the surgical instrument 522, 523. FIGS. 32-34 show one example embodiment of the instrument mounting portion 558 showing components for translating motion of the driven elements 564 into motion of the surgical instrument 522, 523. FIGS. 32-34 show the instrument mounting portion with a shaft 538 having a surgical end effector 610 at a distal end thereof. The end effector 610 may be any suitable type of end effector for performing a surgical task on a patient. For example, the end effector may be configured to provide RF and/or ultrasonic energy to tissue at a surgical site. The shaft 538 may be rotatably coupled to the instrument mounting portion 558 and secured by a top shaft holder 646 and a bottom shaft holder 648 at a coupler 650 of the shaft 538. In one example embodiment, the instrument mounting portion 558 comprises a mechanism for translating rotation of the various driven elements 564 into rotation of the shaft 538, differential translation of members along the axis of the shaft (e.g., for articulation), and reciprocating translation of one or more members along the axis of the shaft 538 (e.g., for extending and retracting tissue cutting elements such as 555, overtubes and/or other components). In one example embodiment, the rotatable bodies 612 (e.g., rotatable spools) are coupled to the driven elements 564. The rotatable bodies 612 may be formed integrally with the driven elements 564. In some embodiments, the rotatable bodies 612 may be formed separately from the driven elements 564 provided that the rotatable bodies 612 and the driven elements 564 are fixedly coupled such that driving the driven elements 564 causes rotation of the rotatable bodies 612. Each of the rotatable bodies 612 is coupled to a gear train or gear mechanism to provide shaft articulation and rotation and clamp jaw open/close and knife actuation. In one example embodiment, the instrument mounting portion 558 comprises a mechanism for causing differential translation of two or more members along the axis of the shaft 538. In the example provided in FIGS. 32-34, this motion is used to manipulate articulation joint 556. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the instrument mounting portion 558 comprises a rack and pinion gearing mechanism to provide the differential translation and thus the shaft articulation functionality. In one example embodiment, the rack and pinion gearing mechanism comprises a first pinion gear 614 coupled to a rotatable body 612 such that rotation of the corresponding driven element 564 causes the first pinion gear 614 to rotate. A bearing 616 is coupled to the rotatable body 612 and is provided between the driven element 564 and the first pinion gear 614. The first pinion gear 614 is meshed to a first rack gear 618 to convert the rotational motion of the first pinion gear 614 into linear motion of the first rack gear 618 to control the articulation of the articulation section 556 of the shaft assembly 538 in a left direction 620L. The first rack gear 618 is attached to a first articulation band 622 (FIG. 32) such that linear motion of the first rack gear 618 in a distal direction causes the articulation section 556 of the shaft assembly 538 to articulate in the left direction 620L. A second pinion gear 626 is coupled to another rotatable body 612 such that rotation of the corresponding driven element 564 causes the second pinion gear 626 to rotate. A bearing 616 is coupled to the rotatable body 612 and is provided between the driven element 564 and the second pinion gear 626. The second pinion gear 626 is meshed to a second rack gear 628 to convert the rotational motion of the second pinion gear 626 into linear motion of the second rack gear 628 to control the articulation of the articulation section 556 in a right direction 620R. The second rack gear 628 is attached to a second articulation band 624 (FIG. 33) such that linear motion of the second rack gear 628 in a distal direction causes the articulation section 556 of the shaft assembly 538 to articulate in the right direction 620R. Additional bearings may be provided between the rotatable bodies and the corresponding gears. Any suitable bearings may be provided to support and stabilize the mounting and reduce rotary friction of shaft and gears, for example. In one example embodiment, the instrument mounting portion 558 further comprises a mechanism for translating rotation of the driven elements 564 into rotational motion about the axis of the shaft 538. For example, the rotational motion may be rotation of the shaft 538 itself. In the illustrated embodiment, a first spiral worm gear 630 coupled to a rotatable body 612 and a second spiral worm gear 632 coupled to the shaft assembly 538. A bearing 616 (FIG. 17) is coupled to a rotatable body 612 and is provided between a driven element 564 and the first spiral worm gear 630. The first spiral worm gear 630 is meshed to the second spiral worm gear 632, which may be coupled to the shaft assembly 538 and/or to another component of the instrument 522, 523 for which longitudinal rotation is desired. Rotation may be caused in a clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) direction based on the rotational direction of the first and second spiral worm gears 630, 632. Accordingly, rotation of the first spiral worm gear 630 about a first axis is converted to rotation of the second spiral worm gear 632 about a second axis, which is orthogonal to the first axis. As shown in FIGS. 32-33, for example, a CW rotation of the second spiral worm gear 632 results in a CW rotation of the shaft assembly 538 in the direction indicated by 634CW. A CCW rotation of the second spiral worm gear 632 results in a CCW rotation of the shaft assembly 538 in the direction indicated by 634CCW. Additional bearings may be provided between the rotatable bodies and the corresponding gears. Any suitable bearings may be provided to support and stabilize the mounting and reduce rotary friction of shaft and gears, for example. In one example embodiment, the instrument mounting portion 558 comprises a mechanism for generating reciprocating translation of one or more members along the axis of the shaft 538. Such translation may be used, for example to drive a tissue cutting element, such as 555, drive an overtube for closure and/or articulation of the end effector 610, etc. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, a rack and pinion gearing mechanism may provide the reciprocating translation. A first gear 636 is coupled to a rotatable body 612 such that rotation of the corresponding driven element 564 causes the first gear 636 to rotate in a first direction. A second gear 638 is free to rotate about a post 640 formed in the instrument mounting plate 562. The first gear 636 is meshed to the second gear 638 such that the second gear 638 rotates in a direction that is opposite of the first gear 636. In one example embodiment, the second gear 638 is a pinion gear meshed to a rack gear 642, which moves in a liner direction. The rack gear 642 is coupled to a translating block 644, which may translate distally and proximally with the rack gear 642. The translation block 644 may be coupled to any suitable component of the shaft assembly 538 and/or the end effector 610 so as to provide reciprocating longitudinal motion. For example, the translation block 644 may be mechanically coupled to the tissue cutting element 555 of the RF surgical device 523. In some embodiments, the translation block 644 may be coupled to an overtube, or other component of the end effector 610 or shaft 538. FIGS. 35-37 illustrate an alternate embodiment of the instrument mounting portion 558 showing an alternate example mechanism for translating rotation of the driven elements 564 into rotational motion about the axis of the shaft 538 and an alternate example mechanism for generating reciprocating translation of one or more members along the axis of the shaft 538. Referring now to the alternate rotational mechanism, a first spiral worm gear 652 is coupled to a second spiral worm gear 654, which is coupled to a third spiral worm gear 656. Such an arrangement may be provided for various reasons including maintaining compatibility with existing robotic systems 500 and/or where space may be limited. The first spiral worm gear 652 is coupled to a rotatable body 612. The third spiral worm gear 656 is meshed with a fourth spiral worm gear 658 coupled to the shaft assembly 538. A bearing 760 is coupled to a rotatable body 612 and is provided between a driven element 564 and the first spiral worm gear 738. Another bearing 760 is coupled to a rotatable body 612 and is provided between a driven element 564 and the third spiral worm gear 652. The third spiral worm gear 652 is meshed to the fourth spiral worm gear 658, which may be coupled to the shaft assembly 538 and/or to another component of the instrument 522, 523 for which longitudinal rotation is desired. Rotation may be caused in a CW and a CCW direction based on the rotational direction of the spiral worm gears 656, 658. Accordingly, rotation of the third spiral worm gear 656 about a first axis is converted to rotation of the fourth spiral worm gear 658 about a second axis, which is orthogonal to the first axis. As shown in FIGS. 36 and 37, for example, the fourth spiral worm gear 658 is coupled to the shaft 538, and a CW rotation of the fourth spiral worm gear 658 results in a CW rotation of the shaft assembly 538 in the direction indicated by 634CW. A CCW rotation of the fourth spiral worm gear 658 results in a CCW rotation of the shaft assembly 538 in the direction indicated by 634CCW. Additional bearings may be provided between the rotatable bodies and the corresponding gears. Any suitable bearings may be provided to support and stabilize the mounting and reduce rotary friction of shaft and gears, for example. Referring now to the alternate example mechanism for generating reciprocating translation of one or more members along the axis of the shaft 538, the tool mounting portion 558 comprises a rack and pinion gearing mechanism to provide reciprocating translation along the axis of the shaft 538 (e.g., translation of a tissue cutting element 555 of the RF surgical device 523). In one example embodiment, a third pinion gear 660 is coupled to a rotatable body 612 such that rotation of the corresponding driven element 564 causes the third pinion gear 660 to rotate in a first direction. The third pinion gear 660 is meshed to a rack gear 662, which moves in a linear direction. The rack gear 662 is coupled to a translating block 664. The translating block 664 may be coupled to a component of the device 522, 523, such as, for example, the tissue cutting element 555 of the RF surgical device and/or an overtube or other component which is desired to be translated longitudinally. FIGS. 38-42 illustrate an alternate embodiment of the instrument mounting portion 558 showing another alternate example mechanism for translating rotation of the driven elements 564 into rotational motion about the axis of the shaft 538. In FIGS. 38-42, the shaft 538 is coupled to the remainder of the mounting portion 558 via a coupler 676 and a bushing 678. A first gear 666 coupled to a rotatable body 612, a fixed post 668 comprising first and second openings 672, first and second rotatable pins 674 coupled to the shaft assembly, and a cable 670 (or rope). The cable is wrapped around the rotatable body 612. One end of the cable 670 is located through a top opening 672 of the fixed post 668 and fixedly coupled to a top rotatable pin 674. Another end of the cable 670 is located through a bottom opening 672 of the fixed post 668 and fixedly coupled to a bottom rotating pin 674. Such an arrangement is provided for various reasons including maintaining compatibility with existing robotic systems 500 and/or where space may be limited. Accordingly, rotation of the rotatable body 612 causes the rotation about the shaft assembly 538 in a CW and a CCW direction based on the rotational direction of the rotatable body 612 (e.g., rotation of the shaft 538 itself). Accordingly, rotation of the rotatable body 612 about a first axis is converted to rotation of the shaft assembly 538 about a second axis, which is orthogonal to the first axis. As shown in FIGS. 38, 39, for example, a CW rotation of the rotatable body 612 results in a CW rotation of the shaft assembly 538 in the direction indicated by 634CW. A CCW rotation of the rotatable body 612 results in a CCW rotation of the shaft assembly 538 in the direction indicated by 634CCW. Additional bearings may be provided between the rotatable bodies and the corresponding gears. Any suitable bearings may be provided to support and stabilize the mounting and reduce rotary friction of shaft and gears, for example. FIGS. 43-46A illustrate an alternate embodiment of the instrument mounting portion 558 showing an alternate example mechanism for differential translation of members along the axis of the shaft 538 (e.g., for articulation). For example, as illustrated in FIGS. 43-46A, the instrument mounting portion 558 comprises a double cam mechanism 680 to provide the shaft articulation functionality. In one example embodiment, the double cam mechanism 680 comprises first and second cam portions 680A, 680B. First and second follower arms 682, 684 are pivotally coupled to corresponding pivot spools 686. As the rotatable body 612 coupled to the double cam mechanism 680 rotates, the first cam portion 680A acts on the first follower arm 682 and the second cam portion 680B acts on the second follower arm 684. As the cam mechanism 680 rotates the follower arms 682, 684 pivot about the pivot spools 686. The first follower arm 682 may be attached to a first member that is to be differentially translated (e.g., the first articulation band 622). The second follower arm 684 is attached to a second member that is to be differentially translated (e.g., the second articulation band 624). As the top cam portion 680A acts on the first follower arm 682, the first and second members are differentially translated. In the example embodiment where the first and second members are the respective articulation bands 622 and 624, the shaft assembly 538 articulates in a left direction 620L. As the bottom cam portion 680B acts of the second follower arm 684, the shaft assembly 538 articulates in a right direction 620R. In some example embodiments, two separate bushings 688, 690 are mounted beneath the respective first and second follower arms 682, 684 to allow the rotation of the shaft without affecting the articulating positions of the first and second follower arms 682, 684. For articulation motion, these bushings reciprocate with the first and second follower arms 682, 684 without affecting the rotary position of the jaw 902. FIG. 46A shows the bushings 688, 690 and the dual cam assembly 680, including the first and second cam portions 680B, 680B, with the first and second follower arms 682, 684 removed to provide a more detailed and clearer view. As illustrated in FIGS. 46B-46C, the instrument mounting portion 558′ may comprise a distal portion 702. The distal portion 702 may comprise various mechanisms for coupling rotation of drive elements 592 to end effectors of the various surgical instruments 522, 523, for example, as described herein above. Proximal of the distal portion 702, the instrument mounting portion 558′ comprises an internal direct current (DC) energy source and an internal drive and control circuit 704. In the illustrated embodiment, the energy source comprises a first and second battery 706, 708. In other respects, the tool mounting portion 558′ is similar to the various embodiments of the tool mounting portion 558 described herein above. The control circuit 704 may operate in a manner similar to that described above with respect to generators 20, 320. For example, when an ultrasonic instrument 522 is utilized, the control circuit 704 may provide an ultrasonic drive signal in a manner similar to that described above with respect to generator 20. Also, for example, when an RF instrument 523 or ultrasonic instrument 522 capable of providing a therapeutic or non-therapeutic RF signal is used, the control circuit 704 may provide an RF drive signal, for example, as described herein above with respect to the module 23 of generator 20 and/or the generator 300. In some embodiments, the control circuit 704 may be configured in a manner similar to that of the control circuit 440 described herein above with respect to FIGS. 18B-18C. Various embodiments of a control system for controlling the robotic surgical system 500 are discussed below. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the terms “proximal” and “distal,” as used in reference to the control system, are defined relative to a clinician gripping the handpiece of the control system. Thus, movement in the distal direction would be movement in a direction away from the clinician. It will be further appreciated that, for convenience and clarity, special terms such as “top” and “bottom” are also used herein with respect to the clinician gripping the handpiece assembly. However, the control system may be used in many orientations and positions, and these terms are not intended to be limiting or absolute. The various embodiments will be described in combination with the robotic surgical system 500 described above. Such description is provided by way of example and not limitation, and is not intended to limit the scope and applications thereof. For example, as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, any one of the described control systems may be useful in combination with a multitude of robotic surgical systems. FIG. 47 illustrates one embodiment of a surgical robot control system 700 in block form. FIGS. 48-50 show one embodiment of surgical robot control system 700 with simplified components. The surgical robot control system 700 may be used in conjunction with various robotic surgical systems, such as, for example, the robotic surgical system 500 described above. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 47, the surgical robot control system 700 may comprise a controller 724 coupled to a handheld surgical user interface 726. The handheld surgical user interface 726 may be coupled to the controller 724 by any suitable coupling system, such as, for example, mechanical coupling, electrical coupling, optical coupling, or any combination thereof. The controller 724 is in signal communication with a robotic surgical system 722. Signal communication between the controller 724 and the robotic surgical system 722 may be accomplished using a variety of mediums and protocols, including, but not limited to, direct wire communication, direct wireless communication, communication over a LAN, WAN, wireless LAN or any other suitable communication system. The robotic surgical system 722 may be any suitable robotic surgical system, including, but not limited to, those described herein. The robotic surgical system 722 comprises an arm cart 710 mechanically and electrically coupled to the robotic surgical system. In one example embodiment, a user may manipulate the handheld surgical user interface 726 to control the robotic surgical system 722 and the arm cart 710. In various embodiments, at least one sensor 712 detects one or more movements of the handheld surgical user interface 726. The sensor 712 communicates these movements to the controller 724. In some embodiments, the at least one sensor 712 may convert the movements directly into control signals for the robotic surgical system. In another embodiment, the at least one sensor 712 may communicate the movements directly to the controller 724 which converts the movement of the handheld surgical user interface 726 into electrical control signals for the robotic surgical system 722 and the arm cart 710. The robotic surgical system 722 receives control signals from the controller 724. The control signals may, in various embodiments, control the robotic surgical system 722 and the arm cart 710 to cause movement of one or more portions of the robotic surgical system 722. These movements may include, without limitation, distal or proximal translation of an end effector or robotic manipulator, left or right translation of an end effector or robotic manipulator, up or down translation of an end effector or robotic manipulator, rotation of an end effector or robotic manipulator, articulation of an end effector or robotic manipulator, and application of various forms of energy, such as, for example, ultrasonic or electrosurgical energy. The handheld surgical user interface 726 may, in various embodiments, be any shape suitable to provide an easily manipulatable handle for a user. In some embodiments, the handheld surgical user interface 726 may be a joystick. In other embodiments, the handheld surgical user interface 726 may be a surgical device handle, similar to those described in relation to FIGS. 1-18. The handheld surgical user interface 726 provides the advantage of allowing a surgeon to operate a robotic surgical system with minimum training. In some embodiments, the handheld surgical user interface 726 provides the advantage of maintaining a user's skill in standard non-robotic surgery by simulating the movements and procedures that would be used in a non-robotic surgery during robotic surgery, allowing a surgeon to seamlessly move between robotic surgical systems and non-robotic surgery with no loss of dexterity or skill. In some embodiments, the handheld surgical user interface may comprise one or more switches. The one or more switches may be configurable to control one or more functions of the end effector of the surgical instrument. For example, a first switch may be configured to control the application of electrosurgical energy to the end effector 523. In another embodiment, a second switch may be configured to control actuation of the first and second jaw members 551A,B of the end effector 523. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any suitable switch may be incorporated into the handheld surgical user interface 726 to provide control of one or more functions of the surgical instrument. In one example embodiment, the surgical robot control system 700 may comprise at least one feedback device 714. The at least one feedback device 714 may coupled to the controller 724, to the socket 716, or both. The at least one feedback device provides a signal to the user that corresponds to one or more predetermined conditions of the robotic surgical system 722. Some or all of the predetermined conditions may be related to the status of energy delivery. For example, feedback may be provided to indicate that energy deliver is on; energy delivery is off; energy delivery is completed. Some or all of the predetermined conditions may also related to a temperature of the end effector and/or blade including. Examples of such predetermined conditions may include that the temperature is high; that the temperature is safe; and/or an indication of actual temperature. Some or all of the predetermined conditions may also relate to the force exerted on the end effector, either by closing or firing. These conditions may related to the thickness of tissue being treated and/or obstructions. The feedback device 714 may provide any suitable form of sensory feedback corresponding to the predetermined instrument conditions. Examples of suitable sensory feedback may include auditory feedback (sound), haptic or tactile feedback (touch), optical feedback (visual or graphic), olfactory feedback (smell), gustatory feedback (taste), and/or equilibrioception (balance feedback). Haptic feedback may be provided through various forms, for example, mechanosensation, including, but not limited to, vibrosensation (vibrations) and pressure-sensation, thermoperception (heat), and/or cryoperception (cold). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any single feedback type, or any combination thereof, may be used to provide a user with feedback from the robotic surgical system 722. In some embodiments, properties of the feedback may provide a quantitative indication of the predetermined conditions. For example, a quantitative indication of a temperature of the end effector may be provided by an audio tone having a pitch that varies with temperature, a series of pulses having a pulse frequency that varies with temperature, etc. The feedback device 714 may be located in any suitable location to provide appropriate feedback to the user. In one example embodiment, the feedback device 714 is located within the housing 728 of the surgical robot control system 700. In another embodiment, the feedback device 714 may be located within the handheld surgical user interface 726. This is shown in FIGS. 48-50, in which the feedback device 714 is shown in phantom in both the housing 728 and the handheld surgical user interface 726. In yet another embodiment, the feedback device may be located within some other portion of the robotic surgical control system, such as, for example, the stereo display 521 (see FIG. 23) or may be a separate unit which interfaces with the controller 724 through a second socket (not shown) mounted on the housing 728. In various embodiments, the handheld surgical user interface 726 connects to the controller 722 and the at least one sensor 712 through a socket 716 (see FIG. 49.) In various embodiments, the socket 716 may be mounted on outer surface of the housing 728. In other embodiments, the socket 716 may be recessed in the housing 728. In one example embodiment, the socket 716 and the at least one sensor 712 may comprise a single device, such as, for example, a six-degrees of movement input device capable of receiving the handheld surgical user interface 726. As shown in FIGS. 48-50, the socket 716 and the at least one sensor 712 may allow the handheld surgical user interface 726 to be manipulated in multiple degrees of movement. The socket 716 and the sensor 712 may allow the handheld surgical user interface 726 to be manipulated in any number of degrees of movement from one degree of movement to six degrees of movement (or free movement). In a six-degrees of movement embodiment, the handheld surgical user interface 726 may be manipulated by translation in three perpendicular axes and rotation about three perpendicular axes. The translation movement may be referred to as, for example, movement along a distal/proximal axis, an up/down axis, or a left/right axis. The rotational movement may be referred to, for example, as pitch, yaw, or roll. One skilled in the art will recognize that these terms are used only for illustration and are not meant to be limiting in any way. In one example embodiment, the handheld surgical user interface 726 may be configured to work with one or more specific surgical instruments attached to the robotic surgical system 722. For example the ultrasonic surgical instrument 522, as described above, may be attached to the robotic surgical system to allow delivery of ultrasonic energy to a tissue site. The handheld surgical user interface may provide specific controls for the ultrasonic surgical instrument, such as, for example, a trigger to activate a clamping motion of the ultrasonic surgical instrument or a switch to activate an ultrasonic generator to deliver ultrasonic energy to the ultrasonic blade 550. In one example embodiment, the surgical robot control system 700 may comprise a surgical instrument compatibility logic 715. The surgical instrument compatibility logic 715 may be configured to provide a signal indicating whether the surgical instrument connected to the arm cart 520 is compatible with the handheld surgical user interface 726 connected to the surgical robot control system 700. By checking to ensure compatibility between the surgical instrument and the handheld surgical user interface 726, the surgical instrument compatibility logic 715 may prevent accidental actuation of the surgical instrument and ensure all functions of the surgical instrument are accessible by a user. In one example embodiment, the surgical instrument compatibility logic 715 may check compatibility between the surgical instrument and the handheld surgical user interface 726 by receiving a unique identifier code from the surgical instrument and comparing this to an identifier code received from the handheld surgical user interface 726. If the identifier codes match a compatibility signal may be provided to the controller 724 to allow translation of signals received by the controller 724 into control signals for the robotic surgical system 722. For example, if the ultrasonic surgical instrument 522 is attached to the arm cart 520, a unique code may be sent to the surgical instrument compatibility logic 715 identifying the ultrasonic surgical instrument 522. In another embodiment, the surgical instrument compatibility logic 715 may check compatibility between the surgical instrument and the handheld surgical user interface 726 by comparing the inputs receivable from the handheld surgical user interface 726 to the control signals receivable by the surgical instrument. If the input signals match the control signals, the surgical instrument compatibility logic may provide the compatibility signal to the controller 724. Those skilled in the art will recognize that any suitable form of compatibility checking may be used by the surgical instrument compatibility logic to compare the surgical instrument and the handheld surgical user interface 726 and is not limited to only the methods described herein. In one example embodiment, the surgical instrument compatibility logic 715 may be executed by a software program running on the controller 724 or any other suitable processor. In another embodiment, the surgical instrument compatibility logic 715 may be executed by one or more logic gates. The logic gates may be hardwired as part of the robotic surgical control system 700 or may be executed by a programmable logic device, such as, for example, a field-programmable gate array. In another embodiment, the surgical instrument compatibility logic 715 may be implemented by one or more state machines. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any suitable hardware, software, or combination thereof may be used to implement the surgical instrument compatibility logic 715. In one example embodiment, the robotic surgical control system may include one or more sensitivity knobs for adjusting the ratio between one or more movements of the handheld surgical user interface 726 and the surgical instrument. In one example embodiment, a sensitivity knob may be adjusted to change the movement ration between the handheld surgical user interface 726 in a proximal or distal direction and movement of the surgical instrument in a corresponding proximal or distal direction. In another embodiment, the one or more sensitivity knobs may control the ration between feedback signal received by the controller from the end effector and the feedback device 714 to provide for varying levels of sensitivity in the feedback delivered to the user. FIGS. 51-52 illustrate one embodiment of a robotic surgical control system 800. The robotic surgical control system 800 comprises a handheld surgical user interface 806. The handheld surgical user interface includes a lever 822 which is interfaced with a one-degree of movement socket 816. The one-degree of movement socket 816 allows the lever 822 to pivot about a pivot point in a distal/proximal direction. In one example embodiment, movement of the lever 822 in a distal direction is converted into movement of a surgical instrument or robotic manipulator in a distal direction relative to the arm cart 520 and a proximal movement of the lever 822 is converted into a movement of the surgical instrument or robotic manipulator in a proximal direction relative to the arm cart 520 (see FIG. 22). In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 51-52, the robotic surgical control system 800 comprises a trigger 820 mounted on the lever 822. The trigger 820 may be depressed by a user to activate a function of the surgical instrument attached to the arm cart 510, such as, for example, a clamping motion of the end effector 523. In the embodiment shown in FIGS. 51-52, the trigger 820 is in electrical communication with the controller 724 through the socket 816. In other embodiments, the trigger 820 may be coupled to the controller 724 through a second socket (not shown) mounted to the housing 808. The lever 822 may also comprise a switch for activating one or more functions of the surgical instrument attached to the robotic surgical system 500. In the illustrated embodiment, the switch is a hat-switch 818. In one example embodiment, the hat-switch 818 controls the application of one or more forms of energy to the end effector of the surgical instrument 522. The hat-switch 818 may be configured to provide ultrasonic energy, electrosurgical energy, or both to the end effector. The hat-switch 818 may interface to the controller 724 through the socket 816 or through a second socket (not shown). In one example embodiment, the switch may comprise a foot pedal connected to the controller 724 through a second socket (not shown). The foot pedal may be operated by a user to control the application of one or more forms of energy to the end effector of the surgical instrument 522. In another embodiment, the switch may be a resistive sleeve placed over the lever 822. A user may apply pressure to the resistive sleeve by squeezing the lever 822. By applying pressure to the resistive sleeve, a user may control the application of one or more functions of the surgical instrument 522, such as, for example, the application of one or more types of energy to the end effector. FIG. 53 illustrates one embodiment of a robotic surgical control system 900. The robotic surgical control system 900 comprises a two-degrees of movement socket 916 for interfacing the handheld electronic surgical instrument 806. The two-degrees of movement socket 916 allows the lever 822 to be manipulated about a pivot point 930 in a distal/proximal direction and in a left/right direction. Movement of the lever 822 results in movement of the robotic surgical system 500 similar to that described above with reference to the robotic surgical control system 800. Movement of the lever 822 in the left/right direction results in rotation of the arm cart 520 in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction (see FIGS. 35-36). In the embodiment shown in FIG. 53, the two-degrees of movement socket 916 comprises a t-shape to allow movement in only the proximal/distal and left/right directions. In another embodiment, the two degrees of movement socket 916 may have a plate placed over the socket 916 and attached to the housing 908 to restrict movement of the lever 822 to only the proximal/distal or left/right directions. FIG. 54 illustrates one embodiment of a robotic surgical control system 1000 comprising an unrestricted two-degrees of movement socket 1016. The unrestricted two-degrees of movement socket 1016 allows the lever-style handheld surgical user interface 1006 to be rotated about a pivot point 1030 in a proximal/distal direction and a left/right direction. The unrestricted two-degrees of movement socket 1016 allows simultaneous rotation in both the proximal/distal and left/right directions, allowing the surgical instrument to be advanced or retracted and rotated simultaneously. By allowing the surgical instrument to be advanced and rotated simultaneously, the unrestricted two-degrees of movement socket 1016 may be advantageously used, for example, to assist in piercing tissue or organs. The lever-style handheld surgical user interface 1006 comprises a hat-switch 1018 for activating a function of the surgical instrument. The hat-switch 1018 may be used to activate any suitable function of the surgical instrument, such as, for example, application of ultrasonic or electrosurgical energy. FIGS. 55-56 illustrate one embodiment of a robot surgical control system 1100 comprising an unrestricted four-degrees of movement socket 1116. The unrestricted four-degrees of movement socket 1116 allows the lever 1122 to be rotated about a pivot point 1130 in a proximal/distal direction and a left/right direction. The unrestricted four-degrees of movement socket 1116 further allows the lever 1122 to rotate about a vertical axis ‘V.’ The handheld surgical user interface 1106 has a fourth-degree of movement by allowing lateral movement along the vertical axis ‘V.’ The handheld surgical user interface 1106 comprises a shepherd's hook trigger 1120 and hat-switch 1118. The shepherd's hook trigger 1120 and the hat-switch 1118 may control one or more functions of the surgical instrument attached to the robotic surgical system. For example, the shepherd's hook trigger 1120 may control a clamping motion of the end effector 523 and the hat-switch 1118 may control application of one or more types of energy, such as electrosurgical energy, to the end effector 523. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the shepherd's hook trigger 1120 and the hat-switch 1118 may be configured to control any suitable function of the surgical instrument. In one example embodiment, the housing 1108 of the robotic surgical control system 1100 has a visual feedback device 1114 mounted thereon. The visual feedback device 1114 may provide a visual signal to an operator regarding one or more functions of the surgical instrument or the robotic surgical control system 1100. In one example embodiment, the visual feedback device 1114 comprises an LED lamp which is illuminated in response to an application of energy to the end effector of the surgical instrument, such as, for example, the end effector 548. In another embodiment, the visual feedback device 1114 may be activated to signal the end of pre-programmed function of the surgical instrument, such as, for example, a computer-controlled cutting and sealing operation. Those skilled in the art will recognize that visual feedback device 1114 may be configured to display the status of any compatible surgical instrument function. FIG. 57 illustrates one embodiment of a robotic surgical control system 1200 which comprises a stand-alone input device 1201. The stand-alone input device 1201 includes the handheld surgical user interface 1206 connected to a base 1208. The base 1208 contains a socket 1216, a sensor 1212, and a cable 1222. The cable 1222 is connected to a second socket 1116′ on the housing 1108. The second socket 1116′ allows the stand-alone input device 1201 to electrically couple to the controller 724. The stand-alone input device 1201 provides the advantage of allowing an input system to be designed for a specific surgical instrument while still interfacing through the same controller 724 used by a handheld surgical user interface 1106 without having to be plugged directly into the socket 1116 on the housing 1108. FIG. 57 further illustrates an embodiment in which multiple stand-alone input devices 1201 or a stand-alone input device 1201 and a handheld surgical user interface 726 may be utilized simultaneously, by interfacing with multiple sockets 1116, 1116′ located on the housing 1108. The stand-alone input device 1201 may contain one or more feedback devices 1214, 1214′ located one the base 1208, within the handheld surgical user interface 1206, or both. The robotic surgical control system 1200 may also utilize the feedback devices 714, 1114, located on the housing 1108. With reference now to FIGS. 55-60, various feedback devices suitable for use with the handheld surgical user interface 726, 806, 1006, 1106, 1206 shall now be described. FIGS. 55-57 illustrate the use of at least one feedback device 714 located within the lever-style handheld surgical user interfaces 1106, 1206. In one example embodiment, the at least one feedback device 714 may comprise vibratory modules 1114′, 1214′ to provide vibratory motion to the lever-style handheld surgical user interfaces 1106, 1206. The vibratory module 1114′, 1214′ may receive a feedback signal from the surgical instrument indicative of a force applied to the surgical instrument by interaction with a tissue site. In one example embodiment, the vibratory module 1114′, 1214′ may generate vibratory movement proportional to the total amount of force applied to the surgical instrument by the tissue site. In other embodiments, the vibratory module 1114′, 1214′ may generate vibratory movement proportional to the amount of force applied to the surgical instrument in a single direction or plain by the tissue site. In another embodiment, the vibratory module 1114′, 1214′ may be configured to generate vibratory motion proportional to the amount of energy delivered to an end effector, such as, for example, electrosurgical energy delivered to end effector 548. In yet another embodiment, the vibratory module 1114′, 1214′ may be configured to generate vibratory motion after a preprogrammed function has been performed, such as, for example, an automatic sealing and cutting algorithm for the end effector 548. The vibratory motion generated by the vibratory module 1114′, 1214′ may be adjusted to provide varying levels of sensitivity to the user. In some embodiments, the one or more feedback devices 714 may provide haptic feedback through one or more force feedback devices 1214″. Force feedback provides a force or motion in a specific direction to resist movement of the handheld surgical user interface in an opposite direction. In one example embodiment, the one or more force feedback devices 1214″ may comprise any suitable device, such as, for example, a servo motor, a solenoid, or a variable pressure switch. In one example embodiment, the force applied by the one or more force feedback devices 1214″ may be proportional to the total force encountered by the surgical instrument when interacting with a tissue site. In other embodiments, the one or more force feedback devices 1214″ may provide a force proportional to a specific interaction between an end effector and a tissue site. For example, In one example embodiment, a force feedback device 1214″ may provide a resistive force to the movement of the shepherd's hook trigger 1120 which is proportional to a force encountered by the jaws 551A,B of the end effector 548 during a tissue clamping operation. FIGS. 58-60 illustrate one embodiment of the at least one feedback device 714 comprising a thermal element 1314. As shown in FIG. 58, the thermal element 1314 may comprise a thermal sleeve configured to be placed over the lever 1022 of the handheld surgical user interface 1006. The thermal element 1314 comprises a cable 1315 for interfacing the thermal element 1314 with a second socket 1016′ located on the housing 1008. FIGS. 59-60 illustrate the thermal element 1314 being placed over the lever 1022. Once the thermal element 1314 has been properly placed and interfaced with the controller 724 through the second socket 1016′, the thermal element may provide tactile feedback to the user in the form of a temperature gradient. In one example embodiment, the temperature gradient may comprise heating the thermal element 1314 proportional to a level of energy delivered to a tissue site by an end effector attached to the surgical instrument, such as, for example, the end effector 548. By heating at a proportional rate to the energy delivered to the tissue site, the thermal element 1314 provides a user with a tactile indication of when a sufficient level of energy has been applied to the tissue site. In another embodiment, the thermal element 1314 may deliver a temperature gradient indicative of a warning or overheating state to alert the user to unsafe conditions. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the proportion between the temperature gradient and the energy deliver to the tissue site may be any proportion, but ideally is calibrated to deliver adequate information to the user without causing discomfort or harm to the user. In one example embodiment, the one or more feedback devices 714 may provide optical feedback to a user. Optical feedback may be provided by any visual indicator, such as, for example, LED lamps, gauges, scales, or any other visual indication. In one example embodiment, the optical feedback may be provided in response to the application of energy to an end effector, such as, for example, end effector 548. In one example embodiment, the robotic surgical system 500 includes one or more sensors for providing one or more feedback signals to the controller 724 for controlling the one or more feedback devices 714. The one or more sensors attached to the robotic surgical system 500 may be a suitable sensor for providing a feedback signal, such as, for example, a linear position sensor, a rotational position sensor, a force sensor, a thermal sensor, or any other sensor type. The one or more sensors may be combined integrally with the surgical instrument 522, 523 attached to the robotic surgical system or may an additional module connected to the surgical instrument 522, 523 to generate the necessary feedback signal. FIG. 61 shows one embodiment of a robotic surgical control system 1300. The robotic surgical control system 1300 includes a handheld surgical user interface 1306. The handheld surgical user interface 1306 is configured to simulate the feel and operation of endoscopic, laparoscopic, or open surgical devices, such as, for example, the surgical instruments shown in FIGS. 1-18. In one example embodiment, the handheld surgical user interface comprises a surgical device handle 1322, a shepherd's hook trigger 1320, a switch 1318, a rotation knob 1326 and an interface shaft 1324. The interface shaft 1324 connects to a six-degrees of movement socket 1316 located on housing 1308. The six-degrees of movement socket 1316 allows the surgical device handle 1322 to be freely manipulated by a user. The surgical device handle 1322 may be advanced or retracted in a distal/proximal direction. In one example embodiment, movement of the surgical device handle 1322 in the distal/proximal direction results in a corresponding movement of a surgical instrument in a distal/proximal direction in relation to the arm cart 520. The handheld surgical user interface 1306 may also be moved through translation in left/right and up/down directions. Translation movement of the handheld surgical user interface 1306 in the left/right or up/down directions may be converted into motion of the surgical instrument in corresponding directions. The six-degrees of movement socket 1316 allows the surgical device handle 1322 to be rotated about a pivot point 1317. The pivot point 1317, In one example embodiment, may correspond to the connection between the interface shaft 1324 and the socket 1316. The handheld surgical user interface 1306 may be rotated about any of the three axes of movement or any combination thereof. The six-degrees of movement socket 1316 and the surgical device handle 1322 allow a user to operate the robotic surgical control system 1300 in a manner identical to the operation of a non-robotic surgical instrument, such as, for example, the surgical instruments shown in FIGS. 1-18. By simulating the movements of a non-robotic surgical instrument, the robotic surgical control system 1300 allows a surgeon to operate a robotic surgical system, such as, for example, the robotic surgical system 500 shown in FIGS. 19-46, with minimum training. The robotic surgical control system 1300 also provides the advantage of allowing a surgeon to maintain their skill in standard surgical procedures during the operation of a robotic surgical system. In one example embodiment, the surgical device handle 1322 may comprise one or more additional inputs for controlling one or more functions of a surgical instrument. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 61, the surgical device handle 1322 comprises a shepherd's hook trigger 1320, a switch 1318, and a rotation knob 1326. The shepherd's hook trigger 1320 may be configured to control, for example, a clamping motion of an end effector attached to the surgical instrument. By pulling the shepherd's hook trigger 1320 towards the handle 1322, a user may cause the jaws of an end effector to pivot into a clamped position, such as, for example, the first and second jaws 551A,B of the end effector 548. Releasing the shepherd's hook trigger 1320 may, in one example embodiment, cause the jaws of the end effector to return to a non-clamped or open position. In one example embodiment, the switch 1318 may control the application of one or more forms of energy to an end effector attached to the surgical instrument 522. The switch 1318 may be configured to deliver, for example, ultrasonic energy to the ultrasonic surgical instrument 522 or electrosurgical energy to the electrosurgical instrument 523. In another embodiment, the switch 1318 may be a multi-position switch which may comprise an off position, a first position configured to deliver ultrasonic energy, a second position configured to deliver electrosurgical energy, and a third position configured to deliver both ultrasonic and electrosurgical energy. As shown in FIG. 61, the handheld surgical user interface 1306 may comprise a rotation knob 1326 mounted to the surgical device handle 1322 and operably coupled to the interface shaft 1324. The rotation knob 1326 may be configured to allow rotation of the interface shaft 1324 about the proximal/distal axis without rotation of the entire surgical device handle 1322. By rotating the rotation knob 1326, a user may cause an elongate shaft, such as for example the elongate shaft assembly 554 of the surgical instrument 522, to rotate while maintaining the same orientation of the surgical device handle 1322. This motion simulates the use of a rotation knob on a non-robotic surgical instrument, such as, for example, the surgical instruments shown in FIGS. 1-18. In one example embodiment, the one or more additional inputs, such as the shepherd's hook trigger 1320, the switch 1318, or the rotation knob 1326, may be connected to the controller 724 by one or more wires (not shown) extending through the interface shaft 1324 and connecting through the six-degrees of movement socket 1316. In another embodiment, the one or more additional inputs may be connected to the controller through a wire which extends from the surgical device handle 1322 and connects to the controller 724 through a second socket (not shown) located on the housing 1308. In yet another embodiment, the one or more additional inputs may communicate with the controller 724 through a wireless communication link, such as, for example, a wireless Bluetooth link. Those skilled in the art will recognize that any suitable communication protocol or medium may be used to connect the one or more additional inputs to the controller 724. In one example embodiment, the robotic surgical control system 1300 comprises one or more feedback devices 714. The one or more feedback devices 714 may be located in the housing 1308, the surgical device handle 1322, or both. The feedback device 714 may provide any suitable form of sensory feedback. Such sensory feedback may include, for example, auditory feedback (sounds), haptic or tactile feedback (touch), optical feedback (visual), olfactory feedback (smell), gustatory feedback (taste), and/or equilibrioception (balance feedback). Haptic feedback may be provided through various forms, for example, mechanosensation, including, but not limited to, vibrosensation (vibrations) and pressure-sensation, thermoperception (heat), and/or cryoperception (cold). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any single feedback type, or any combination thereof, may be provided by the one or more feedback devices 714. FIG. 62 illustrates one embodiment of the robotic surgical control system 1400. The robotic surgical control system 1400 comprises a housing 1408 and a handheld surgical user interface 1406. The handheld surgical user interface 1406 includes a surgical device handle 1422 similar to the surgical device handle 1322 described above. The surgical device handle 1422 includes a second rotation knob 1428 which may be configured to control one or more functions of the surgical instrument 522, such as, for example, the angle of articulation of the elongate shaft assembly 554. In the illustrated embodiment, the surgical device handle 1422 includes the shepherd's hook trigger 1320, the button 1318, and the rotation knob 1326. In other embodiments, the surgical device handle 1400 may comprise some or none of the one or more additional inputs. In one example embodiment, the rotational inputs, such as, for example, the second rotation knob 1428, may comprise one or more detents to allow for precise settings of various rotational positions. The detents may correspond to one or more ribs located on the surgical device handle 1422 to allow the second rotation knob 1428 to assume precise rotational positions which correspond to one or more precise positions of the surgical instrument 522. For example, in one example embodiment, the second rotation knob 1428 may control an articulation function of the surgical instrument 522, such as, for example, articulation of the elongate shaft assembly 554. In this embodiment, the second rotation knob 1428 may comprise one or more detents which correspond to one or more predetermined articulation positions of the elongate shaft assembly 554. In one example embodiment, the robotic surgical control system 1400 comprises a three degrees of movement socket 1416. The three degrees of movement socket 1416 allows the surgical device handle 1422 to be connected to the housing 1408 and the controller 724 through the interface shaft 1324. The three degrees of movement socket 1416 allows the surgical device handle 1422 to be laterally advanced or retracted in a distal/proximal direction relative to the user of the device. In addition, the three-degrees of movement socket 1416 allows the surgical device handle 1422 to be pivoted in an up/down and left/right direction about a pivot point 1430 defined by the interface between the three degrees of movement socket 1416 and the interface shaft 1324. As described above, a three degrees of movement input socket, such as the three degrees of movement socket 1416, allows a user to control three movements of a surgical instrument simultaneously. In one example embodiment, the three degrees of movement socket 1416 may be configured to control lateral movement of a surgical instrument in a distal/proximal direction in response to lateral movement of the surgical device handle 1422 in a distal or proximal direction. Rotational movement of the surgical device handle 1422 about the pivot point 1430 in the left or right direction may, In one example embodiment, be converted into later movement of the surgical instrument 522 in a left/right direction in relation to the arm cart 520. Rotational movement of the surgical device handle 1422 about the pivot point 1430 in an up/down direction may result in lateral movement of the surgical instrument 522 with respect to the arm cart 520. FIG. 63 illustrates various feedback devices that may be used with the surgical device handles 1322, 1422. In the illustrated embodiment, the surgical device handle 1422 is illustrated with part of the outer surface removed and housing 1308 is shown with a side wall removed to illustrate the internal components therein. In one example embodiment, the housing 1308 may contain a feedback device coupled to the six-degrees of movement socket 1316 to provide haptic feedback, in the form of force feedback, such as, for example, the electromagnetic clutch 1438. In one example embodiment, the electromagnetic clutch 1438 may be configured to provide a resistive force to the movement of the six-degrees of movement socket 1316. This resistive force is transferred through the interface shaft 1324 to the surgical device handle 1422. A user moving the surgical device handle 1422 will sense the resistive force through the surgical device handle 1422. The resistive force generated by the electromagnetic clutch 1438 maybe proportional to a resistive force encountered by a surgical instrument 522 in contact with a target tissue site. In one example embodiment, the resistive force generated by the electromagnetic clutch 1438 is directly proportional to the force encountered by a surgical instrument 522 in contact with a target tissue site. In other embodiments, the force generated by the electromagnetic clutch 1438 may be one or more orders of magnitude larger, so as to provide greater feedback to the user. The electromagnetic clutch 1438 may provide resistive forces in any of the available degrees of movement. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the electromagnetic clutch 1438 is coupled to the six-degrees of movement socket 1316. The electromagnetic clutch may provide resistive force to movement of the six-degrees of movement socket 1316 in any one of, or any combination of, the available six-degrees of movement. In one example embodiment, one or more force feedback devices may be located within the surgical device handle 1422. In the illustrated embodiment, two trigger feedback devices 1432a,b are connected to the shepherd's hook trigger 1320. The trigger feedback devices 1432a,b provide haptic feedback in the form of a resistive force when pulling or releasing the shepherd's hook trigger 1320. In one example embodiment, the trigger feedback devices 1432a,b provide a resistive force to the movement of the shepherd's hook trigger 1320 that is proportional to a force encountered by the jaws of an end effector connected to the surgical instrument, such as, for example, the jaws 551A,B of electrosurgical end effector 548. For solely illustrative purposes, the trigger feedback devices 1432a,b shall be described in conjunction with end effector 548. In operation, a tissue portion is positioned between the jaws 551A,B of the end effector 548. The shepherd's hook trigger 1320 may be moved in a distal direction to cause the jaws 551A,B to pivot from an open position to a closed position. As the jaws 551A,B move to a closed position, tissue located between the jaws 551A,B provides a resistive force to the closure of the jaws 551A,B. The trigger feedback devices 1432a,b may provide resistance to the movement of the shepherd's hook trigger 1320 that is proportional to the force encountered by the jaws 551A,B of the end effector 548. By providing feedback to the shepherd's hook trigger 1320, the device provides an indication to a user regarding the tissue located between the jaws 551A,B of the end effector 548, such as, for example, whether a proper amount of tissue is located between the jaws 551A,B or what type of tissue is located between the jaws 551A,B. As shown in FIG. 63, the surgical device handle 1422 may further comprise one or more rotational feedback devices. The rotation feedback devices, such as the articulation rotation feedback device 1430, may provide haptic feedback in the form of resistive force to rotation of one or more inputs, such as, for example, the second rotation knob 1428. The resistive force provided by the articulation rotation feedback device 1430, in one example embodiment, may be proportional to a force applied to an end effector in contact with a tissue site. In one example embodiment, a sensor may detect the force applied to an articulation joint of the surgical instrument 522, such as, for example, articulation joint 556. In one example embodiment, rotation of the second rotation knob 1428 may be converted by the controller 724 into control signals that cause the articulation joint 556 to articulate the shaft 554. The end effector, such as, for example the end effector 548, may come into contact with tissue as a result of the articulation movement. As the end effector 548 comes into contact with tissue, a sensor on the surgical device 523 may provide the controller 724 with a signal indicative of the amount of force applied to the end effector 548 by the tissue site (see FIG. 68). The controller 724 may cause the articulation rotation feedback device 1430 to apply a resistive force to the rotation of the second rotation knob 1428 that is proportional to the force encountered by the end effector 548. As shown in FIG. 63, the surgical device handle 1422 may further comprise a vibratory module 1440 configured to provide vibratory motion to the surgical device handle 1422. In one example embodiment, the vibratory module 1440 may receive a feedback signal from a sensor coupled to an end effector, such as, for example, end effector 528 (see FIG. 68). When the end effector 528 comes into contact with tissue, a force is exerted on the end effector 528 by the tissue. The feedback signal may, In one example embodiment, be indicative of the amount of force encountered by the end effector 528. The vibratory module 1440 may convert the feedback signal into vibratory motion of the surgical device handle 1422 to provide a tactile feedback signal to the user which is proportional to the amount of force applied to the end effector 528 by the tissue site. In one example embodiment, the vibratory module 1440 may increase the rate of vibration exponentially as the feedback signal increases to provide a user with a tactile warning of possible tissue damage. In another embodiment, the vibratory module 1440 may be configured to receive a feedback signal from the end effector 528 indicative of the amount of energy being applied to a tissue site by the end effector 528. In this embodiment, the vibratory module 1440 may increase the rate of vibration as the temperature of the tissue site increases in response to the application of energy. In another embodiment, vibratory module may activate to indicate to the user that a predetermined amount of time has passed, indicating sufficient application of energy to the tissue site. In one example embodiment, the rotatable input devices, such as the first rotation knob 1326 and the second rotation knob 1428, may be connected to a rotational encoder for converting the rotation of the rotatable input devices into electrical signals for transmission to the controller 724. In the illustrated embodiment, rotation of the interface shaft 1324 via rotation of the first rotation knob 1326 is converted into an electrical signal by the rotational encoder 1436. The rotational encoder 1436 converts the angular position or motion of the interface shaft 1324 to an analog or digital signal receivable by the controller 724. The rotational encoder 1436 may be any suitable type of rotational encoder, such as, for example, an absolute or incremental encoder. In another embodiment, the rotatable input devices may be connected to one or more potentiometers, such as, for example, a rotary input potentiometer 1442. The rotary input potentiometer 1442 adjusts the output voltages based on the rotational position of shepherd's hook trigger 1320, allowing the mechanical position of the shepherd's hook trigger to be converted into a signal receivable by the controller 724. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that any suitable electronic component for converting the mechanical rotation or movement of an input device may be used to generate a signal receivable by the controller 724. FIGS. 64-65 illustrate two possible embodiments of the relationship between the movement of the handheld surgical user interface 1406 and the end effector 528. In one example embodiment, shown in FIG. 64, rotation of the handheld surgical user interface 1406 about a pivot point 1430 results in an articulating movement of end effector 528 in the same direction, e.g., rotation of the handheld surgical user interface 1406 in a right direction, shown as arrow ‘A’ results in movement of the end effector 528 in the same, right direction. In another embodiment, shown in FIG. 65, rotation of the handheld surgical user interface 1406 about the pivot point 1430 results in a mirror-image rotation of the end effector 528, e.g., rotation of the handheld surgical user interface 1406 in a right direction, shown as arrow ‘A’ results in rotation of the end effector 528 in an opposite, left direction, shown as arrow ‘B’. The relationship between the direction of travel of the handheld surgical user interface 1406 and the end effector 528 may be chosen to mimic the relationship between the handpiece of a non-robotic surgical device and an end effector, such as, for example, the surgical instruments shown in FIGS. 1-18. FIG. 66 illustrates one embodiment of a wireless robotic surgical control system 1500 utilizing an optical interface between a wireless handheld surgical user interface 1506 and a wireless socket 1516. The wireless socket 1516 may be configured to receive any suitable wireless signal from the wireless handheld surgical user interface 1506, such as, for example an optical signal (utilizing a laser in the visual or non-visual spectrum), a radiofrequency signal, a microwave signal, or an infrared signal. In one example embodiment, the wireless handheld surgical user interface 1506 includes a wireless shaft 1524 for transmitting a compatible wireless signal from the handheld surgical user interface 1506 to the wireless socket 1516. In one example embodiment, the signal transmitted to the socket 1516 may include signals generated by one or more additional inputs located on or within the wireless surgical device handle 1522 of the wireless handheld surgical user interface 1506, such as, for example, the shepherd's hook trigger 1320, the first rotational knob 1326, or the second rotational knob 1428. In another embodiment, the one or more additional inputs may utilize a separate wireless signal, such as, for example, a wireless Bluetooth signal, to communicate with the controller 724. In some embodiments, the wireless socket 1516 and the wireless shaft 1524 may comprise a two-way communication system. In this embodiment, the wireless socket 1516 is capable of receiving signals from the wireless shaft 1524 and transmitting those signals to the controller 724 located in the housing 1508. The wireless socket 1516 may also be capable of transmitting a signal from the controller 724 to the wireless handheld surgical user interface 1506 for controlling functions of the wireless handheld surgical user interface, such as, for example, providing control signals for one or more feedback devices 714 located within the wireless surgical device handle 1522. In another embodiment, a second wireless socket (not shown) may be located in the housing 1508 to transmit signals from the controller 724 to the wireless handheld surgical user interface 1506 for controlling the one or more feedback devices 174 located within the wireless surgical device handle 1522. FIG. 67 shows one embodiment of the robotic surgical control system 1300 interfaced with standard robotic surgical control system, such as, for example, controller 518. As illustrated in FIG. 67, the robotic surgical control system 1300 may be connected to the controller 518 to provide additional control functionality to controller 518. The controller 518, as described above, may provide an image of a working site through the display 521. The controller 724 may interface with the controller 518 through any suitable communication medium, such as, for example, a cable extending from the housing 1308. In the illustrated embodiment, the controller 518 further comprises one or more control knobs 1346a,b,c for controlling various functions of the handheld surgical user interface 1506. In one example embodiment, the one or more control knobs 1346a,b,c may be adjusted to control the ration between movement of the handheld surgical user interface 1306 and the surgical instrument 522. For example, in one example embodiment, the first control knob 1346a may control the ration of movement between a longitudinal movement of the handheld surgical user interface 1306 in a distal or proximal direction and a longitudinal movement of the surgical instrument 522. The second control knob 1346b may be configured to control the ratio between movement of the handheld surgical user interface 1306 about the pivot point 1330 in a left or right direction and lateral movement of the surgical instrument 522 in a left or right direction. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that the control knobs 1346a,b,c, may be configured to control the ratio of movement between any portion of the robotic surgical control system 1300 and any portion of the robotic surgical system 500. In one example embodiment, the ratio of movement between the handheld surgical user interface 1306 and the surgical instrument 522 may have a maximum ratio of 1:1 to movement. In this embodiment, a movement of the handheld surgical user interface of 1 cm is converted into a corresponding movement of the surgical instrument by 1 cm. In some embodiments, the ratio of movement may be adjusted such that the surgical instrument moves at a fractional value of the movement of the handheld surgical user interface. For example, in one example embodiment, the control knob 1346a may be adjusted such that movement of the handheld surgical user interface in the distal direction of 1 cm results in movement of the surgical instrument 522 in the distal direction of 0.25 cm. Those skilled in the art will recognize that these examples are non-limiting, and that the ratio of movement between the handheld surgical user interface 1306 and the surgical instrument 522 may be a suitable ratio. In one example embodiment, one or more sensitivity knobs may be located on the surgical device handle 1322 of the handheld surgical user interface 1306. The one or more sensitivity knobs may be located on any portion of the surgical device handle 1322. In one example embodiment, the a sensitivity knob may be located on the proximal-most part of the surgical device handle 1322 to allow a user to easily adjust the movement ratio between the surgical device handle 1322 and the surgical instrument 522. In one example embodiment, the one or more control knobs 1346a,b,c may be configured to control one or more functions of the display 521. For example, in one example embodiment, the third control knob 1346c may be rotated to adjust the view seen through the display 521. Adjustments to the view may include, for example, changing the magnification of the view, changing the angle of the view, or changing the location being viewed. FIG. 68 illustrates one method for generating a feedback signal for the one or more feedback devices 714. The surgical instrument 1522 is a surgical instrument suitable for use with the robotic surgical system 500, such as, for example, surgical instrument 522. In the illustrated embodiment, the surgical instrument 1522 is rotatable about a longitudinal axis of the shaft 1538. As the shaft 1538 is rotated about the longitudinal axis, the end effector 1523 may come into contact with a tissue site 1530. The tissue site 1530 provides a resistive force to the rotation of the shaft 1538. A feedback gear 1524 is located on the shaft 1538 and rotates in unison with the shaft 1538. The feedback gear 1524 is operatively coupled to a resistive measurement device 1526. The resistive measurement device 1526 is configured to measure the resistive force encountered by the end effector 1523 in contact with the tissue site 1530 and generate a feedback signal which is transmitted to the controller 724 to control the one or more feedback devices 714. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that FIG. 68 illustrates only one of the possible methods of generating a feedback signal for the one or more feedback devices 714. The feedback signal may be generated by other suitable means, such as, for example, a potentiometer, a rheostat, a position sensor, a linear displacement sensor, a capacitive sensor, an electrical resistance sensor, or any other suitable sensor for generating a feedback signal for the one or more feedback devices. The control devices disclosed herein may be designed to be disposed of after a single use, or they can be designed to be used multiple times with one or more different types of end effectors. In either case, however, the devices can be reconditioned for reuse after at least one use. Reconditioning can include any combination of the steps of disassembly of the device, followed by cleaning or replacement of particular pieces, and subsequent reassembly. In particular, the devices can be disassembled, and any number of the particular pieces or parts of the devices can be selectively replaced, added, or removed in any combination. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the recondition of the devices can utilize a variety of techniques for disassembly, replacement, reprogramming, or reconfiguring. The use of such techniques, and the resulting reconditioned device, are all within the scope of the present application. Non-Limiting Examples In one embodiment a robotic surgical system is provided.

In one embodiment method for controlling a robotic surgical device is provided. The method comprises interfacing, via a socket, a controller and a handheld surgical user interface; manipulating, by a user, the handheld surgical user interface to produce one or more electrical signals via a sensor operatively coupled to the handheld surgical user interface and the controller; converting, via the controller, the one or more electrical signals into one or more control signals for the robotic surgical device; receiving, via the controller, one or more feedback signals from the robotic surgical device, and producing, via a feedback device, one or more feedback conditions to emulate one or more interactions between the robotic surgical device and a tissue site.
