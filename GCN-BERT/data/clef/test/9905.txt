SEQUENCE LISTING The present application is being filed along with a Sequence Listing in electronic format. The Sequence Listing is provided as a file entitled BIOL0206WOSEQ.txt, created Oct. 30, 2013, which is 88 Kb in size. The information in the electronic format of the sequence listing is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND The pyruvate kinase M (PK-M) gene has 12 exons. Exon 9 and exon 10 are alternatively spliced in a mutually exclusive fashion to give rise to the M1 and M2 isoforms of the PK-M gene. Inclusion of exon 9 and exclusion of exon 10 yields the PK-M1 isoform. Exclusion of exon 9 and inclusion of exon 10 yields the PK-M2 isoform. Exons 9 and 10 each encode a 56 amino acid segment that confers distinctive properties to the respective PK-M1 and PK-M2 isoforms. The PK-M2 isoform is expressed in a broad range of cancer cells, whereas PK-M1 is predominantly expressed in terminally differentiated tissues. Antisense compounds have been used to modulate target nucleic acids. Antisense compounds comprising a variety of chemical modifications and motifs have been reported. In certain instances, such compounds are useful as research tools, diagnostic reagents, and as therapeutic agents. In certain instances antisense compounds have been shown to modulate protein expression by binding to a target messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding the protein. In certain instances, such binding of an antisense compound to its target mRNA results in cleavage of the mRNA. Antisense compounds that modulate processing of a pre-mRNA have also been reported. Such antisense compounds alter splicing, interfere with polyadenlyation or prevent formation of the 5′-cap of a pre-mRNA. Certain antisense compounds have been described previously. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 7,399,845 and published International Patent Application No. WO 2008/049085, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

In certain embodiments, an oligomeric compound comprises one or more conjugate groups and/or terminal groups. In certain embodiments, an oligomeric compound consists of an oligonucleotide. As used herein, “terminal group” means one or more atom attached to either, or both, the 3′ end or the 5′ end of an oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments a terminal group is a conjugate group. In certain embodiments, a terminal group comprises one or more terminal group nucleosides. As used herein, “conjugate” means an atom or group of atoms bound to an oligonucleotide or oligomeric compound. In general, conjugate groups modify one or more properties of the compound to which they are attached, including, but not limited to pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, binding, absorption, cellular distribution, cellular uptake, charge and/or clearance properties.

As used herein, “detecting” or “measuring” means that a test or assay for detecting or measuring is performed. Such detection and/or measuring may result in a value of zero. Thus, if a test for detection or measuring results in a finding of no activity (activity of zero), the step of detecting or measuring the activity has nevertheless been performed. As used herein, “detectable and/or measurable activity” means a statistically significant activity that is not zero. As used herein, “essentially unchanged” means little or no change in a particular parameter, particularly relative to another parameter which changes much more. In certain embodiments, a parameter is essentially unchanged when it changes less than 5%. In certain embodiments, a parameter is essentially unchanged if it changes less than two-fold while another parameter changes at least ten-fold. For example, in certain embodiments, an antisense activity is a change in the amount of a target nucleic acid. In certain such embodiments, the amount of a non-target nucleic acid is essentially unchanged if it changes much less than the target nucleic acid does, but the change need not be zero. As used herein, “expression” means the process by which a gene ultimately results in a protein. Expression includes, but is not limited to, transcription, post-transcriptional modification (e.g., splicing, polyadenlyation, addition of 5′-cap), and translation. As used herein, “target nucleic acid” means a nucleic acid molecule to which an antisense compound hybridizes. As used herein, “mRNA” means an RNA molecule that encodes a protein. As used herein, “pre-mRNA” means an RNA transcript that has not been fully processed into mRNA. Pre-RNA includes one or more intron. As used herein, “transcript” means an RNA molecule transcribed from DNA. Transcripts include, but are not limited to mRNA, pre-mRNA, and partially processed RNA.

As used herein, “targeting” or “targeted to” means the association of an antisense compound to a particular target nucleic acid molecule or a particular region of a target nucleic acid molecule. An antisense compound targets a target nucleic acid if it is sufficiently complementary to the target nucleic acid to allow hybridization under physiological conditions. As used herein, “nucleobase complementarity” or “complementarity” when in reference to nucleobases means a nucleobase that is capable of base pairing with another nucleobase. For example, in DNA, adenine (A) is complementary to thymine (T). For example, in RNA, adenine (A) is complementary to uracil (U). In certain embodiments, complementary nucleobase means a nucleobase of an antisense compound that is capable of base pairing with a nucleobase of its target nucleic acid. For example, if a nucleobase at a certain position of an antisense compound is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleobase at a certain position of a target nucleic acid, then the position of hydrogen bonding between the oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid is considered to be complementary at that nucleobase pair. Nucleobases comprising certain modifications may maintain the ability to pair with a counterpart nucleobase and thus, are still capable of nucleobase complementarity. As used herein, “non-complementary” in reference to nucleobases means a pair of nucleobases that do not form hydrogen bonds with one another. As used herein, “complementary” in reference to oligomeric compounds (e.g., linked nucleosides, oligonucleotides, or nucleic acids) means the capacity of such oligomeric compounds or regions thereof to hybridize to another oligomeric compound or region thereof through nucleobase complementarity under stringent conditions. Complementary oligomeric compounds need not have nucleobase complementarity at each nucleoside. Rather, some mismatches are tolerated. In certain embodiments, complementary oligomeric compounds or regions are complementary at 70% of the nucleobases (70% complementary). In certain embodiments, complementary oligomeric compounds or regions are 80% complementary. In certain embodiments, complementary oligomeric compounds or regions are 90% complementary. In certain embodiments, complementary oligomeric compounds or regions are 95% complementary. In certain embodiments, complementary oligomeric compounds or regions are 100% complementary. As used herein, “hybridization” means the pairing of complementary oligomeric compounds (e.g., an antisense compound and its target nucleic acid). While not limited to a particular mechanism, the most common mechanism of pairing involves hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleobases. As used herein, “specifically hybridizes” means the ability of an oligomeric compound to hybridize to one nucleic acid site with greater affinity than it hybridizes to another nucleic acid site. In certain embodiments, an antisense oligonucleotide specifically hybridizes to more than one target site. As used herein, “percent complementarity” means the percentage of nucleobases of an oligomeric compound that are complementary to an equal-length portion of a target nucleic acid. Percent complementarity is calculated by dividing the number of nucleobases of the oligomeric compound that are complementary to nucleobases at corresponding positions in the target nucleic acid by the total length of the oligomeric compound. As used herein, “percent identity” means the number of nucleobases in a first nucleic acid that are the same type (independent of chemical modification) as nucleobases at corresponding positions in a second nucleic acid, divided by the total number of nucleobases in the first nucleic acid. As used herein, “modulation” means a change of amount or quality of a molecule, function, or activity when compared to the amount or quality of a molecule, function, or activity prior to modulation. For example, modulation includes the change, either an increase (stimulation or induction) or a decrease (inhibition or reduction) in gene expression. As a further example, modulation of expression can include a change in splice site selection of pre-mRNA processing, resulting in a change in the absolute or relative amount of a particular splice-variant compared to the amount in the absence of modulation. As used herein, “motif” means a pattern of chemical modifications in an oligomeric compound or a region thereof. Motifs may be defined by modifications at certain nucleosides and/or at certain linking groups of an oligomeric compound. As used herein, “nucleoside motif” means a pattern of nucleoside modifications in an oligomeric compound or a region thereof. The linkages of such an oligomeric compound may be modified or unmodified. Unless otherwise indicated, motifs herein describing only nucleosides are intended to be nucleoside motifs. Thus, in such instances, the linkages are not limited. As used herein, “sugar motif” means a pattern of sugar modifications in an oligomeric compound or a region thereof. As used herein, “linkage motif” means a pattern of linkage modifications in an oligomeric compound or region thereof. The nucleosides of such an oligomeric compound may be modified or unmodified. Unless otherwise indicated, motifs herein describing only linkages are intended to be linkage motifs. Thus, in such instances, the nucleosides are not limited. As used herein, “nucleobase modification motif” means a pattern of modifications to nucleobases along an oligonucleotide. Unless otherwise indicated, a nucleobase modification motif is independent of the nucleobase sequence. As used herein, “sequence motif” means a pattern of nucleobases arranged along an oligonucleotide or portion thereof. Unless otherwise indicated, a sequence motif is independent of chemical modifications and thus may have any combination of chemical modifications, including no chemical modifications. As used herein, “type of modification” in reference to a nucleoside or a nucleoside of a “type” means the chemical modification of a nucleoside and includes modified and unmodified nucleosides. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, a “nucleoside having a modification of a first type” may be an unmodified nucleoside. As used herein, “differently modified” mean chemical modifications or chemical substituents that are different from one another, including absence of modifications. Thus, for example, a MOE nucleoside and an unmodified DNA nucleoside are “differently modified,” even though the DNA nucleoside is unmodified. Likewise, DNA and RNA are “differently modified,” even though both are naturally-occurring unmodified nucleosides. Nucleosides that are the same but for comprising different nucleobases are not differently modified. For example, a nucleoside comprising a 2′-OMe modified sugar and an unmodified adenine nucleobase and a nucleoside comprising a 2′-OMe modified sugar and an unmodified thymine nucleobase are not differently modified. As used herein, “the same type of modifications” refers to modifications that are the same as one another, including absence of modifications. Thus, for example, two unmodified DNA nucleoside have “the same type of modification,” even though the DNA nucleoside is unmodified. Such nucleosides having the same type modification may comprise different nucleobases. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent” means any substance suitable for use in administering to an animal. In certain embodiments, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent is sterile saline. In certain embodiments, such sterile saline is pharmaceutical grade saline. As used herein, “substituent” and “substituent group,” means an atom or group that replaces the atom or group of a named parent compound. For example a substituent of a modified nucleoside is any atom or group that differs from the atom or group found in a naturally occurring nucleoside (e.g., a modified 2′-substituent is any atom or group at the 2′-position of a nucleoside other than H or OH). Substituent groups can be protected or unprotected. In certain embodiments, compounds of the present invention have substituents at one or at more than one position of the parent compound. Substituents may also be further substituted with other substituent groups and may be attached directly or via a linking group such as an alkyl or hydrocarbyl group to a parent compound. Likewise, as used herein, “substituent” in reference to a chemical functional group means an atom or group of atoms differs from the atom or a group of atoms normally present in the named functional group. In certain embodiments, a substituent replaces a hydrogen atom of the functional group (e.g., in certain embodiments, the substituent of a substituted methyl group is an atom or group other than hydrogen which replaces one of the hydrogen atoms of an unsubstituted methyl group).

In certain embodiments, bicyclic sugar moieties and nucleosides incorporating such bicyclic sugar moieties are further defined by isomeric configuration. For example, a nucleoside comprising a 4′-2′ methylene-oxy bridge, may be in the α-L configuration or in the β-D configuration. Previously, α-L-methyleneoxy (4′-CH2—O-2′) bicyclic nucleosides have been incorporated into antisense oligonucleotides that showed antisense activity (Frieden et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2003, 21, 6365-6372). In certain embodiments, substituted sugar moieties comprise one or more non-bridging sugar substituent and one or more bridging sugar substituent (e.g., 5′-substituted and 4′-2′ bridged sugars). (see, PCT International Application WO 2007/134181, published on Nov. 22, 2007, wherein LNA is substituted with, for example, a 5′-methyl or a 5′-vinyl group). In certain embodiments, modified sugar moieties are sugar surrogates. In certain such embodiments, the oxygen atom of the naturally occurring sugar is substituted, e.g., with a sulfur, carbon or nitrogen atom. In certain such embodiments, such modified sugar moiety also comprises bridging and/or non-bridging substituents as described above. For example, certain sugar surrogates comprise a 4′-sulfur atom and a substitution at the 2′-position (see, e.g., published U.S. Patent Application US2005/0130923, published on Jun. 16, 2005) and/or the 5′ position. By way of additional example, carbocyclic bicyclic nucleosides having a 4′-2′ bridge have been described (see, e.g., Freier et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 1997, 25(22), 4429-4443 and Albaek et al., J. Org. Chem., 2006, 71, 7731-7740). In certain embodiments, sugar surrogates comprise rings having other than 5-atoms. For example, in certain embodiments, a sugar surrogate comprises a six-membered tetrahydropyran. Such tetrahydropyrans may be further modified or substituted. Nucleosides comprising such modified tetrahydropyrans include, but are not limited to, hexitol nucleic acid (HNA), anitol nucleic acid (ANA), manitol nucleic acid (MNA) (see Leumann, C J. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. (2002) 10:841-854), fluoro HNA (F-HNA), and those compounds having Formula VII: wherein independently for each of said at least one tetrahydropyran nucleoside analog of Formula VII: Bx is a nucleobase moiety; T3 and T4 are each, independently, an internucleoside linking group linking the tetrahydropyran nucleoside analog to the antisense compound or one of T3 and T4 is an internucleoside linking group linking the tetrahydropyran nucleoside analog to the antisense compound and the other of T3 and T4 is H, a hydroxyl protecting group, a linked conjugate group, or a 5′ or 3′-terminal group; q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 and q7 are each, independently, H, C1-C6 alkyl, substituted C1-C6 alkyl, C2-C6 alkenyl, substituted C2-C6 alkenyl, C2-C6 alkynyl, or substituted C2-C6 alkynyl; and each of R1 and R2 is independently selected from among: hydrogen, halogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, NJ1J2, SJ1, N3, OC(═X)J1, OC(═X)NJ1J2, NJ3C(═X)NJ1J2, and CN, wherein X is O, S or NJ1, and each J1, J2, and J3 is, independently, H or C1-C6 alkyl. In certain embodiments, the modified THP nucleosides of Formula VII are provided wherein q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 and q7 are each H. In certain embodiments, at least one of q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 and q7 is other than H. In certain embodiments, at least one of q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6 and q7 is methyl. In certain embodiments, THP nucleosides of Formula VII are provided wherein one of R1 and R2 is F. In certain embodiments, R1 is fluoro and R2 is H, R1 is methoxy and R2 is H, and R1 is methoxyethoxy and R2 is H. Many other bicyclic and tricyclic sugar and sugar surrogate ring systems are known in the art that can be used to modify nucleosides (see, e.g., review article: Leumann, J. C, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 2002, 10, 841-854). In certain embodiments, sugar surrogates comprise rings having more than 5 atoms and more than one heteroatom. For example nucleosides comprising morpholino sugar moieties and their use in oligomeric compounds has been reported (see for example: Braasch et al., Biochemistry, 2002, 41, 4503-4510; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,685; 5,166,315; 5,185,444; and 5,034,506). As used here, the term “morpholino” means a sugar surrogate having the following structure: In certain embodiments, morpholinos may be modified, for example by adding or altering various substituent groups from the above morpholino structure. Such sugar surrogates are referred to herein as “modified morpholinos.” Combinations of modifications are also provided without limitation, such as 2′-F-5′-methyl substituted nucleosides (see PCT International Application WO 2008/101157 Published on Aug. 21, 2008 for other disclosed 5′,2′-bis substituted nucleosides) and replacement of the ribosyl ring oxygen atom with S and further substitution at the 2′-position (see published U.S. Patent Application US2005-0130923, published on Jun. 16, 2005) or alternatively 5′-substitution of a bicyclic nucleic acid (see PCT International Application WO 2007/134181, published on Nov. 22, 2007 wherein a 4′-CH2—O-2′ bicyclic nucleoside is further substituted at the 5′ position with a 5′-methyl or a 5′-vinyl group). The synthesis and preparation of carbocyclic bicyclic nucleosides along with their oligomerization and biochemical studies have also been described (see, e.g., Srivastava et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129(26), 8362-8379). Certain Nucleobases In certain embodiments, nucleosides of the present invention comprise one or more unmodified nucleobases.

Certain Internucleoside Linkages In certain embodiments, the present invention provides oligomeric compounds comprising linked nucleosides. In such embodiments, nucleosides may be linked together using any internucleoside linkage. The two main classes of internucleoside linking groups are defined by the presence or absence of a phosphorus atom. Representative phosphorus containing internucleoside linkages include, but are not limited to, phosphodiesters (P═O), phosphotriesters, methylphosphonates, phosphoramidate, and phosphorothioates (P═S). Representative non-phosphorus containing internucleoside linking groups include, but are not limited to, methylenemethylimino (—CH2—N(CH3)—O—CH2—), thiodiester (—O—C(O)—S—), thionocarbamate (—O—C(O)(NH)—S—); siloxane (—O—Si(H)2—O—); and N,N′-dimethylhydrazine (—CH2—N(CH3)—N(CH3)—). Modified linkages, compared to natural phosphodiester linkages, can be used to alter, typically increase, nuclease resistance of the oligomeric compound. In certain embodiments, internucleoside linkages having a chiral atom can be prepared as a racemic mixture, or as separate enantiomers. Representative chiral linkages include, but are not limited to, alkylphosphonates and phosphorothioates. Methods of preparation of phosphorous-containing and non-phosphorous-containing internucleoside linkages are well known to those skilled in the art. The oligonucleotides described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric configurations that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R) or (S), a or β such as for sugar anomers, or as (D) or (L) such as for amino acids etc. Included in the antisense compounds provided herein are all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. Neutral internucleoside linkages include without limitation, phosphotriesters, methylphosphonates, MMI (3′-CH2—N(CH3)—O-5′), amide-3 (3′-CH2—C(═O)—N(H)-5′), amide-4 (3′-CH2—N(H)—C(═O)-5′), formacetal (3′-O—CH2—O-5′), and thioformacetal (3′-S—CH2—O-5′). Further neutral internucleoside linkages include nonionic linkages comprising siloxane (dialkylsiloxane), carboxylate ester, carboxamide, sulfide, sulfonate ester and amides (See for example: Carbohydrate Modifications in Antisense Research; Y. S. Sanghvi and P. D. Cook, Eds., ACS Symposium Series 580; Chapters 3 and 4, 40-65). Further neutral internucleoside linkages include nonionic linkages comprising mixed N, O, S and CH2 component parts. Certain Motifs In certain embodiments, the present invention provides oligomeric compounds comprising oligonucleotides. In certain embodiments, such oligonucleotides comprise one or more chemical modification. In certain embodiments, chemically modified oligonucleotides comprise one or more modified nucleosides. In certain embodiments, chemically modified oligonucleotides comprise one or more modified nucleosides comprising modified sugars. In certain embodiments, chemically modified oligonucleotides comprise one or more modified nucleosides comprising one or more modified nucleobases. In certain embodiments, chemically modified oligonucleotides comprise one or more modified internucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, the chemically modifications (sugar modifications, nucleobase modifications, and/or linkage modifications) define a pattern or motif. In certain embodiments, the patterns of chemical modifications of sugar moieties, internucleoside linkages, and nucleobases are each independent of one another. Thus, an oligonucleotide may be described by its sugar modification motif, internucleoside linkage motif and/or nucleobase modification motif (as used herein, nucleobase modification motif describes the chemical modifications to the nucleobases independent of the sequence of nucleobases). Certain Sugar Motifs In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides comprise one or more type of modified sugar moieties and/or naturally occurring sugar moieties arranged along an oligonucleotide or region thereof in a defined pattern or sugar modification motif Such motifs may include any of the sugar modifications discussed herein and/or other known sugar modifications. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotides comprise or consist of a region having a gapmer sugar modification motif, which comprises two external regions or “wings” and an internal region or “gap.” The three regions of a gapmer motif (the 5′-wing, the gap, and the 3′-wing) form a contiguous sequence of nucleosides wherein at least some of the sugar moieties of the nucleosides of each of the wings differ from at least some of the sugar moieties of the nucleosides of the gap. Specifically, at least the sugar moieties of the nucleosides of each wing that are closest to the gap (the 3′-most nucleoside of the 5′-wing and the 5′-most nucleoside of the 3′-wing) differ from the sugar moiety of the neighboring gap nucleosides, thus defining the boundary between the wings and the gap. In certain embodiments, the sugar moieties within the gap are the same as one another. In certain embodiments, the gap includes one or more nucleoside having a sugar moiety that differs from the sugar moiety of one or more other nucleosides of the gap. In certain embodiments, the sugar modification motifs of the two wings are the same as one another (symmetric gapmer). In certain embodiments, the sugar modification motifs of the 5′-wing differs from the sugar modification motif of the 3′-wing (asymmetric gapmer). In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides comprise 2′-MOE modified nucleosides in the wings and 2′-F modified nucleosides in the gap. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are fully modified. In certain such embodiments, oligonucleotides are uniformly modified. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are uniform 2′-MOE. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are uniform 2′-F. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are uniform morpholino. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are uniform BNA. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are uniform LNA. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are uniform cEt. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides comprise a uniformly modified region and additional nucleosides that are unmodified or differently modified. In certain embodiments, the uniformly modified region is at least 5, 10, 15, or 20 nucleosides in length. In certain embodiments, the uniform region is a 2′-MOE region. In certain embodiments, the uniform region is a 2′-F region. In certain embodiments, the uniform region is a morpholino region. In certain embodiments, the uniform region is a BNA region. In certain embodiments, the uniform region is a LNA region. In certain embodiments, the uniform region is a cEt region. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide does not comprise more than 4 contiguous unmodified 2′-deoxynucleosides. In certain circumstances, antisesense oligonucleotides comprising more than 4 contiguous 2′-deoxynucleosides activate RNase H, resulting in cleavage of the target RNA. In certain embodiments, such cleavage is avoided by not having more than 4 contiguous 2′-deoxynucleosides, for example, where alteration of splicing and not cleavage of a target RNA is desired. Certain Internucleoside Linkage Motifs In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides comprise modified internucleoside linkages arranged along the oligonucleotide or region thereof in a defined pattern or modified internucleoside linkage motif. In certain embodiments, internucleoside linkages are arranged in a gapped motif, as described above for sugar modification motif. In such embodiments, the internucleoside linkages in each of two wing regions are different from the internucleoside linkages in the gap region. In certain embodiments the internucleoside linkages in the wings are phosphodiester and the internucleoside linkages in the gap are phosphorothioate. The sugar modification motif is independently selected, so such oligonucleotides having a gapped internucleoside linkage motif may or may not have a gapped sugar modification motif and if it does have a gapped sugar motif, the wing and gap lengths may or may not be the same. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides comprise a region having an alternating internucleoside linkage motif. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides of the present invention comprise a region of uniformly modified internucleoside linkages. In certain such embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises a region that is uniformly linked by phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide is uniformly linked by phosphorothioate. In certain embodiments, each internucleoside linkage of the oligonucleotide is selected from phosphodiester and phosphorothioate. In certain embodiments, each internucleoside linkage of the oligonucleotide is selected from phosphodiester and phosphorothioate and at least one internucleoside linkage is phosphorothioate. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises at least 6 phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises at least 8 phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises at least 10 phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises at least one block of at least 6 consecutive phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises at least one block of at least 8 consecutive phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises at least one block of at least 10 consecutive phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. In certain embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises at least block of at least one 12 consecutive phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. In certain such embodiments, at least one such block is located at the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide. In certain such embodiments, at least one such block is located within 3 nucleosides of the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide. Certain Nucleobase Modification Motifs In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides comprise chemical modifications to nucleobases arranged along the oligonucleotide or region thereof in a defined pattern or nucleobases modification motif. In certain such embodiments, nucleobase modifications are arranged in a gapped motif. In certain embodiments, nucleobase modifications are arranged in an alternating motif. In certain embodiments, each nucleobase is modified. In certain embodiments, none of the nucleobases is chemically modified. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides comprise a block of modified nucleobases. In certain such embodiments, the block is at the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments the block is within 3 nucleotides of the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide. In certain such embodiments, the block is at the 5′-end of the oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments the block is within 3 nucleotides of the 5′-end of the oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments, nucleobase modifications are a function of the natural base at a particular position of an oligonucleotide. For example, in certain embodiments each purine or each pyrimidine in an oligonucleotide is modified. In certain embodiments, each adenine is modified. In certain embodiments, each guanine is modified. In certain embodiments, each thymine is modified. In certain embodiments, each cytosine is modified. In certain embodiments, each uracil is modified. In certain embodiments, some, all, or none of the cytosine moieties in an oligonucleotide are 5-methyl cytosine moieties. Herein, 5-methyl cytosine is not a “modified nucleobase.” Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, unmodified nucleobases include both cytosine residues having a 5-methyl and those lacking a 5 methyl. In certain embodiments, the methylation state of all or some cytosine nucleobases is specified. Certain Overall Lengths In certain embodiments, the present invention provides oligomeric compounds including oligonucleotides of any of a variety of ranges of lengths.

In embodiments where the number of nucleosides of an oligomeric compound or oligonucleotide is limited, whether to a range or to a specific number, the oligomeric compound or oligonucleotide may, nonetheless further comprise additional other substituents. For example, an oligonucleotide comprising 8-30 nucleosides excludes oligonucleotides having 31 nucleosides, but, unless otherwise indicated, such an oligonucleotide may further comprise, for example one or more conjugates, terminal groups, or other substituents. In certain embodiments, a gapmer oligonucleotide has any of the above lengths. One of skill in the art will appreciate that certain lengths may not be possible for certain motifs. For example: a gapmer having a 5′-wing region consisting of four nucleotides, a gap consisting of at least six nucleotides, and a 3′-wing region consisting of three nucleotides cannot have an overall length less than 13 nucleotides. Thus, one would understand that the lower length limit is 13 and that the limit of 10 in “10-20” has no effect in that embodiment. Further, where an oligonucleotide is described by an overall length range and by regions having specified lengths, and where the sum of specified lengths of the regions is less than the upper limit of the overall length range, the oligonucleotide may have additional nucleosides, beyond those of the specified regions, provided that the total number of nucleosides does not exceed the upper limit of the overall length range. For example, an oligonucleotide consisting of 20-25 linked nucleosides comprising a 5′-wing consisting of 5 linked nucleosides; a 3′-wing consisting of 5 linked nucleosides and a central gap consisting of 10 linked nucleosides (5+5+10=20) may have up to 5 nucleosides that are not part of the 5′-wing, the 3′-wing, or the gap (before reaching the overall length limitation of 25). Such additional nucleosides may be 5′ of the 5′-wing and/or 3′ of the 3′ wing. Certain Oligonucleotides In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides of the present invention are characterized by their sugar motif, internucleoside linkage motif, nucleobase modification motif and overall length. In certain embodiments, such parameters are each independent of one another. Thus, each internucleoside linkage of an oligonucleotide having a gapmer sugar motif may be modified or unmodified and may or may not follow the gapmer modification pattern of the sugar modifications. Thus, the internucleoside linkages within the wing regions of a sugar-gapmer may be the same or different from one another and may be the same or different from the internucleoside linkages of the gap region. Likewise, such sugar-gapmer oligonucleotides may comprise one or more modified nucleobase independent of the gapmer pattern of the sugar modifications. Herein if a description of an oligonucleotide or oligomeric compound is silent with respect to one or more parameter, such parameter is not limited. Thus, an oligomeric compound described only as having a gapmer sugar motif without further description may have any length, internucleoside linkage motif, and nucleobase modification motif. Unless otherwise indicated, all chemical modifications are independent of nucleobase sequence. Certain Conjugate Groups In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds are modified by attachment of one or more conjugate groups. In general, conjugate groups modify one or more properties of the attached oligomeric compound including but not limited to pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, stability, binding, absorption, cellular distribution, cellular uptake, charge and clearance. Conjugate groups are routinely used in the chemical arts and are linked directly or via an optional conjugate linking moiety or conjugate linking group to a parent compound such as an oligomeric compound, such as an oligonucleotide. Conjugate groups includes without limitation, intercalators, reporter molecules, polyamines, polyamides, polyethylene glycols, thioethers, polyethers, cholesterols, thiocholesterols, cholic acid moieties, folate, lipids, phospholipids, biotin, phenazine, phenanthridine, anthraquinone, adamantane, acridine, fluoresceins, rhodamines, coumarins and dyes. Certain conjugate groups have been described previously, for example: cholesterol moiety (Letsinger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1989, 86, 6553-6556), cholic acid (Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let., 1994, 4, 1053-1060), a thioether, e.g., hexyl-S-tritylthiol (Manoharan et al., Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci., 1992, 660, 306-309; Manoharan et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let., 1993, 3, 2765-2770), a thiocholesterol (Oberhauser et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1992, 20, 533-538), an aliphatic chain, e.g., do-decan-diol or undecyl residues (Saison-Behmoaras et al., EMBO J., 1991, 10, 1111-1118; Kabanov et al., FEBS Lett., 1990, 259, 327-330; Svinarchuk et al., Biochimie, 1993, 75, 49-54), a phospholipid, e.g., di-hexadecyl-rac-glycerol or triethyl-ammonium 1,2-di-O-hexadecyl-rac-glycero-3-H-phosphonate (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 3651-3654; Shea et al., Nucl. Acids Res., 1990, 18, 3777-3783), a polyamine or a polyethylene glycol chain (Manoharan et al., Nucleosides & Nucleotides, 1995, 14, 969-973), or adamantane acetic acid (Manoharan et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 1995, 36, 3651-3654), a palmityl moiety (Mishra et al., Biochim Biophys. Acta, 1995, 1264, 229-237), or an octadecylamine or hexylamino-carbonyl-oxycholesterol moiety (Crooke et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1996, 277, 923-937). In certain embodiments, a conjugate group comprises an active drug substance, for example, aspirin, warfarin, phenylbutazone, ibuprofen, suprofen, fen-bufen, ketoprofen, (S)-(+)-pranoprofen, carprofen, dansylsarcosine, 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid, flufenamic acid, folinic acid, a benzothiadiazide, chlorothiazide, a diazepine, indo-methicin, a barbiturate, a cephalosporin, a sulfa drug, an antidiabetic, an antibacterial or an antibiotic. In certain embodiments, conjugate groups are directly attached to oligonucleotides in oligomeric compounds. In certain embodiments, conjugate groups are attached to oligonucleotides by a conjugate linking group. In certain such embodiments, conjugate linking groups, including, but not limited to, bifunctional linking moieties such as those known in the art are amenable to the compounds provided herein. Conjugate linking groups are useful for attachment of conjugate groups, such as chemical stabilizing groups, functional groups, reporter groups and other groups to selective sites in a parent compound such as for example an oligomeric compound. In general a bifunctional linking moiety comprises a hydrocarbyl moiety having two functional groups. One of the functional groups is selected to bind to a parent molecule or compound of interest and the other is selected to bind essentially any selected group such as chemical functional group or a conjugate group. In some embodiments, the conjugate linker comprises a chain structure or an oligomer of repeating units such as ethylene glycol or amino acid units. Examples of functional groups that are routinely used in a bifunctional linking moiety include, but are not limited to, electrophiles for reacting with nucleophilic groups and nucleophiles for reacting with electrophilic groups. In some embodiments, bifunctional linking moieties include amino, hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, thiol, unsaturations (e.g., double or triple bonds), and the like. Some nonlimiting examples of conjugate linking moieties include pyrrolidine, 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (ADO), succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) and 6-aminohexanoic acid (AHEX or AHA). Other linking groups include, but are not limited to, substituted C1-C10 alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted C2-C10 alkenyl or substituted or unsubstituted C2-C10 alkynyl, wherein a nonlimiting list of preferred substituent groups includes hydroxyl, amino, alkoxy, carboxy, benzyl, phenyl, nitro, thiol, thioalkoxy, halogen, alkyl, aryl, alkenyl and alkynyl. Conjugate groups may be attached to either or both ends of an oligonucleotide (terminal conjugate groups) and/or at any internal position. In certain embodiments, conjugate groups are at the 3′-end of an oligonucleotide of an oligomeric compound. In certain embodiments, conjugate groups are near the 3′-end. In certain embodiments, conjugates are attached at the 3′end of an oligomeric compound, but before one or more terminal group nucleosides. In certain embodiments, conjugate groups are placed within a terminal group. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides oligomeric compounds. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds comprise an oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments, an oligomeric compound comprises an oligonucleotide and one or more conjugate and/or terminal groups. Such conjugate and/or terminal groups may be added to oligonucleotides having any of the chemical motifs discussed above. Thus, for example, an oligomeric compound comprising an oligonucleotide having region of alternating nucleosides may comprise a terminal group. Antisense Compounds In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds of the present invention are antisense compounds. Such antisense compounds are capable of hybridizing to a target nucleic acid, resulting in at least one antisense activity. In certain embodiments, antisense compounds specifically hybridize to one or more target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, a specifically hybridizing antisense compound has a nucleobase sequence comprising a region having sufficient complementarity to a target nucleic acid to allow hybridization and result in antisense activity and insufficient complementarity to any non-target so as to avoid non-specific hybridization to any non-target nucleic acid sequences under conditions in which specific hybridization is desired (e.g., under physiological conditions for in vivo or therapeutic uses, and under conditions in which assays are performed in the case of in vitro assays). In certain embodiments, the present invention provides antisense compounds comprising oligonucleotides that are fully complementary to the target nucleic acid over the entire length of the oligonucleotide. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are 99% complementary to the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, oligonucleotides are 95% complementary to the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, such oligonucleotides are 90% complementary to the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, such oligonucleotides are 85% complementary to the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, such oligonucleotides are 80% complementary to the target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, an antisense compound comprises a region that is fully complementary to a target nucleic acid and is at least 80% complementary to the target nucleic acid over the entire length of the oligonucleotide. In certain such embodiments, the region of full complementarity is from 6 to 14 nucleobases in length. In certain embodiments antisense compounds and antisense oligonucleotides comprise single-strand compounds. In certain embodiments antisense compounds and antisense oligonucleotides comprise double-strand compounds.

Accordingly, nucleic acid sequences provided herein, including, but not limited to those in the sequence listing, are intended to encompass nucleic acids containing any combination of natural or modified RNA and/or DNA, including, but not limited to such nucleic acids having modified nucleobases. By way of further example and without limitation, an oligomeric compound having the nucleobase sequence “ATCGATCG” encompasses any oligomeric compounds having such nucleobase sequence, whether modified or unmodified, including, but not limited to, such compounds comprising RNA bases, such as those having sequence “AUCGAUCG” and those having some DNA bases and some RNA bases such as “AUCGATCG” and oligomeric compounds having other modified or naturally occurring bases, such as “ATmeCGAUCG,” wherein meC indicates a cytosine base comprising a methyl group at the 5-position. EXAMPLES The following examples illustrate certain embodiments of the present invention and are not limiting. Moreover, where specific embodiments are provided, the inventors have contemplated generic application of those specific embodiments. For example, disclosure of an oligonucleotide having a particular motif provides reasonable support for additional oligonucleotides having the same or similar motif And, for example, where a particular high-affinity modification appears at a particular position, other high-affinity modifications at the same position are considered suitable, unless otherwise indicated. Example 1 Screening in HEK-293 Cells to Identify Antisense Oligonucleotides that Promote the Expression of the Pyruvate Kinase M1 Isoform Via Alternative Splicing Alternative splicing of the Pyruvate kinase M (PK-M) gene involves a choice between mutually exclusive exons 9 and 10. An antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) screen was carried out to identify potent ASOs that switch the splicing of endogenous PK-M transcripts to include exon 9, thereby promoting PK-M1 isoform expression and down-regulating PK-M2 isoform expression. A diagram of the PK-M genomic region is presented in FIG. 1a. The ASOs were designed as uniform oligonucleotides, 15 nucleotides in length, with 2′-O-methoxyethyl ribose sugar residues and a phosphorothioate backbone. All the cytosine nucleobases are 5-methylcytosines. The ASOs target exon 10 of the complement of GENBANK Accession No. NT—010194.16 truncated from nucleotides 43281289 to 43314403 (designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 1), and cover the 167-nucleotide region of exon 10 in 5-nucleotide steps, as presented in Table 1. To examine the effects of antisense oligonucleotide treatment of the cells on endogenous PK-M transcripts, HEK-293 cells were transfected with each ASO at a final concentration of 30 nM. HEK-293 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown at a density of 2×106 cells in 6-cm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin, at 37° C. and 5% CO2. Transfections were performed using an ASO: LipofectAMINE2000® ratio of 20 pmoles: 1 μL. Splicing of the PK-M transcripts by radioactive RT-PCR was analyzed 48 hrs after transfection. Two micrograms of total RNA was extracted from the cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.). Contaminating DNA was removed with DNase I (Promega). Reverse transcription was carried out using ImPromp-II reverse transcriptase (Promega). Semiquantitative PCR using Amplitaq polymerase (Applied Biosystems) was performed by including [α-32P]-dCTP in the reactions. The human-specific primer sets used to amplify endogenous transcripts anneal to PK-M exons 8 and 11, and their sequences are: hPKMF: 5′-AGAAACAGCCAAAGGGGACT-3′ (designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 2) and hPKMR: 5′-CATTCATGGCAAAGTTCACC-3′ (designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 3). The primers are represented by arrows at the top portion of FIG. 1a. After 27 amplification cycles for endogenous transcripts, the reactions were divided into two aliquots for digestion with PstI (New England Biolabs) or no digestion. Pst1 digestion was carried out to distinguish between M1 and M2; only M2 has a PstI site, resulting in two cleavage products, B1 (213 nucleotides) and B2 (185 nucleotides) which are the 3′ and 5′ ends of M2 respectively, as shown at the bottom portion of FIG. 1a. The products were analyzed on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified on a Typhoon 9410 phosphorimager (GE Healthcare) using Multi Gauge software Version 2.3. The results are presented in FIG. 1b, and Table 1. The % M1 mRNA in endogenous transcripts was calculated using the GC-content-normalized intensities of the top undigested band (M1; depicted as A in the figure), the bottom two digested bands (M2; depicted as B1 and B2 in the figure) in the Pst1-digest lanes, and the double-skipped species (D), if detectable. Each product was quantified as a percentage of the total of M1, M2, and double-skipped species. % M1 and % M2 are presented in the Table. The first row of Table 1 denotes the numbers from the untreated control set of cells. Some of the ASOs strongly increased the proportion of PK-M1 mRNA, with a concurrent increase in the amount of double-skipped mRNA, and a decrease in PK-M2 mRNA. The results indicate that these ASOs target functional enhancer splice elements (ESEs) in exon 10. The two most potent ASOs were ISIS 461456 and ISIS 461472. ISIS 461472 targets the previously characterized exon 10 SRSF3 motif (Wang, Z. et al., J. Mol. Cell Biol. 4: 79-87, 2012), whereas ISIS 461456 targets a non-overlapping 15-nucleotide region in the middle of exon 10.

Overlapping 15-nucleotide ASOs were designed in 1-nucleotide steps. The ASOs were designed as uniform oligonucleotides, 15 nucleotides in length, with 2′-O-methoxyethyl ribose sugar residues and a phosphorothioate backbone. All the cytosine nucleobases are 5-methylcytosines. The ASOs target exon 10 of SEQ ID NO: 1. To examine the effects of antisense oligonucleotide treatment of the cells on endogenous PK-M transcripts, HEK-293 cells were transfected with each ASO at a final concentration of 60 nM. Cell culture, transfection and RNA analysis was conducted in a similar manner to that described in Example 1. The results of the microwalks are presented in FIG. 1c and Tables 2 and 3. The % M1 mRNA in endogenous transcripts was calculated using the GC-content-normalized intensities of the top undigested band (M1; depicted as A in the figure), the bottom two digested bands (M2; depicted as B1 and B2 in the figure) in the Pst1-digest lanes, and the double-skipped species (D), if detectable. Each product was quantified as a percentage of the total of M1, M2, and double-skipped species. % M1 and % M2 are presented in the Tables below. All standard deviations are ≦4% (n=3). The results indicate that ISIS 549197 was the most potent in increasing endogenous PK-M1 mRNA and decreasing PK-M2 mRNA levels. The results also indicate that ISIS 555158 optimally abrogated the SRSF3-dependent ESE in exon 10.

To map the enhancer elements present in the target region of ISIS 461456, the high sequence identity between exons 9 and 10 was taken advantage of The PK-M2 minigene was constructed by amplifying a 6.4 kb PK-M exon 8-11 fragment from human genomic DNA (Promega), using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase and primers PKMinigeneF (5′-GGGGAAGATATCAATTCCCCATTCTGTCTTCCCATGT-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 37) and PKMinigeneR (5′-GGGGAACTCGAGCTAGACATTCATGGCAAAGTTCACC-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 38). The product was then digested and cloned between the BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1+(Invitrogen). For exon-duplication and intron-deletion constructs, the upstream KpnI site 1552 nt downstream of exon 8 was removed by a 1-nt deletion, and an EcoRV restriction site was generated 90 nt upstream of exon 9 by a 2-nt insertion to create a modified wild-type minigene. To generate the 10 W, 10B7 and 10F7 constructs, modified exon 9 fragments were generated by annealing the following oligonucleotides: 10 W F (5′-CCCTAAACCTTACAGATAGCTCGTGAGGCTGAGGCAGCCATGTTCCACCGCAAGCTGTTTGAGG AACTCCGCCGAGCCTCAAGTCACTCCACAGACCTCATGGAAGCCAT-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 39), 10F7F (5′-CCCTAAACCTTACAGATAGCTCGTGAGGCTGAGGCAGCCATGTTCCACCGCAAGCTGTTTGAGG AACTTGTGCGAGCCTCAAGTCACTCCACAGACCTCATGGAAGCCAT-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 40), 10B7F (5′-CCCTAAACCTTACAGATAGCTCGTGAGGCTGAGGCAGCCATGTTCCACCGCAAGCTGTTTGAAG AACTCCGCCGAGCCTCAAGTCACTCCACAGACCTCATGGAAGCCAT-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 41) with Exon 9Rev oligo (5′-CCCTTAGGGCCCTACCTGCCAGACTCCGTCAGAACTATCAAAGCTGCTGCTAAACACTTATAAG AAGCCTCCACGCTGCCCATGGCCATGGCTTCCATGAGGTCTG-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 42) and amplifying using Ex10ADupF (5′-TTCCCCATTCTGTCTTCCCATGTGTTGTGTCTCGTTTTTTTCCTCCTCCTTCCCTCTTCCTTGCCCC CTCTTCCCCTAAACCTTACAG-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 43) and Ex10ADupR (5′-AGTGTTACCTGCCCTTAGGGCCCTAC-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 44). The 106-nt oligonucleotide carries mutations that duplicate specific stretches of exon 10 over the corresponding region of exon 9. Another fragment was amplified from the wild-type minigene using the following primer pairs: Ex10BF: 5′-GTAGGGCCCTAAGGGCAGGTAACAC-3′ (designated SEQ ID NO: 45) and RKpnI: 5′-GGGGAAGGTACCACTGAGCAGGGCATT-3′ (designated SEQ ID NO: 46). Both fragments were then gel-purified, subjected to a second overlap-extension (OE) PCR using the end primers FEcoRV (5′-GGGGAAGATATCAATTCCCCATTCTGTCTTCCCATGT-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 47) and RKpnI (5′-GGGGAGGTACCACTGAGCAGGGCATT-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 48). As shown in FIG. 2a, the minigene comprises the same genomic region as indicated in FIG. 1a. The 10 W minigene duplicates the entire exon 10 10 W region into exon 9; the 1 OF minigene duplicates the first eight nucleotides of ISIS 549197; and the 10B minigene duplicates the last seven nucleotides of ISIS 549197. Due to the low baseline PK-M1 inclusion from the wild-type minigene, any strong ESEs comprised by the candidate regions was expected to lead to an increase in PK-M1 mRNAs expressed from the mini-gene. The results are presented in FIG. 2b and Table 4. Standard deviations are 0.2%, 0.3%, and 2.6% for 10G, 10F, and 10B, respectively (n=3). The data indicate that duplication of the B7 region (10B), but not the F7 (10F) and 10 W region, lead to increased exon 9 inclusion. This result suggests that the 8-nucleotide B7 motif is a bona fide exon 10 ESE. TABLE 4 Analysis of minigenes 10W, 10F and 10B Minigene % M1 10W 2 10F <1 10B 29 Example 4 Characterization of the Mechanism of Action of the ASOs To characterize the mechanism of action of ISIS 461456 and ISIS 549197 on the inclusion of exon 9 and skipping of exon 10, these ASOs were co-transfected with the PK-M wild-type or duplicated exon 10 minigenes. The wild-type minigene comprises the flanking exons 8 and 11, and the complete genomic region between both exons, whereas the duplication construct has exon 10 replaced completely with exon 9. HEK-293 cells were cultured, as described above. Five μg of minigene plasmid per 10-cm dish or one μg per 6-cm dish was transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE2000® (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.). ASOs were transfected, as described above, at a final concentration of 60 nM. A control ASO (5′-TCATTTGCTTCATACAGG-3′, designated as SEQ ID NO: 49) was also used. The results are presented in FIGS. 2c and d, as well as in Table 5. Standard deviations for FIG. 2c are 0.6%, 4.2% and 2.9% for control, ISIS 461456 and ISIS 549197, respectively (n=3). Standard deviations for FIG. 2d are 0.8%, 0.9%, and 2.6% for control, ISIS 461456 and ISIS 549197, respectively (n=3). As expected, both ISIS 461456 and ISIS 549197 switched the splicing of the minigene transcript by simultaneously increasing the amount of the M1 mRNA and decreasing the amount of the M2 mRNA expressed from the wild-type minigene (FIG. 2c and Table 5). However, ISIS 461456 increased exon 9 inclusion to a greater extent than ISIS 549197, although the latter decreased exon 10 inclusion to a greater extent, resulting in higher levels of double-skipped (Skp) transcripts. Co-transfection of ISIS 461456 or ISIS 549197 with the exon 10 duplication minigene interfered with the inclusion of exon 10, leading to a large increase in double skipped species (FIG. 2d and Table 5). ISIS 461456 was especially potent, nearly converting all the mRNA to the Skp isoform. These results suggest that both ISIS 461456 and ISIS 549197 interfere with the activation of exon 10.

To weigh the relative contributions of the exon 10 and intron 9 complementary regions for the effect of ISIS 461456 and ISIS 549197 on PK-M splicing, minigene mutation were made that eliminated the presumptive target sites in exon 10, intron 9, or both. The effect of the ASOs on splicing of the mutant minigene transcripts was then determined Three mutants were generated (FIG. 2e). The exon 10 10 W region was mutated by duplicating the corresponding exon 9 region and termed the d10 W construct. To generate the d10 W minigene construct, a modified exon 10 fragment was constructed by annealing d10 W F (5′-ATGTTGCTCCCCTAGATTGCCCGTGAGGCAGAGGCTGCCATCTACCACTTGCAATTATTTGAAGA ACTTGTGCGCCTGGCGCCCATTACCAGCGACCCCACAGAAGCCAC-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 50) with Exon 10 Rev (5′-CGCTGCCGCCTCCTACCTGCCAGACTTGGTGAGGACGATTATGGCCCCACTGCAGCACTTGAAG GAGGCCTCCACGGCACCCACGGCGGTGGCTTCTGTGGGGTCGCT-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 51) and amplifying using Ex9ADupF (5′-TGGACGGATGTTGCTCCCCTAG-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 52) and Ex9ADupR (5′-GGTACCACTGAGCAGGGCATTCCAGGGAGCCGCTGCCGCCTCCTAC-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 53). The 108-nt oligonucleotide carries mutations that duplicate specific stretches of exon 9 over the corresponding region in exon 10. Another fragment was amplified from the wild-type minigene using the following primer pairs: FEcoRV and Ex9BR (5′-GTAGGGCCCTAAGGGCAGGTAACAC-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 54). Both fragments were then gel-purified and subjected to a second OE PCR reaction using the FEcoRV and RKpnI primers. A 15-nucleotide deletion was introduced in intron 9 that removed the homologous target region and this was termed the dInt9 construct. To generate the dInt9 mutant, two fragments were generated from the wild-type minigene construct, using the following primer pairs: FEcoRV and PKMdelB12R (5′ TGCCCTGCCATGACCTCCCAGACGAGAAGAGGCTCTGTGCCCAG-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 55) and PKMdelB125 (5′-ACAGAGCCTCTTCTCGTCTGGGAGGTCATGGCAGGGCAG-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 56). To generate the dM double mutant, the same two fragments were generated from the d10 W minigene. Both fragments were then gel-purified and subjected to a second OE PCR using FEcoRV and RKpnI. All generated fragments were then cloned between the EcoRV and KpnI sites of the modified wild-type minigene plasmid. There was a slight decrease in baseline minigene PK-M2 mRNA expressed from the d10 W minigenes (FIG. 2f and Table 6), suggesting that the duplicated exon 9 region contains weak repressor elements. This was not the case for the dInt9 construct, suggesting that this region alone does not have a major effect in dictating M1/M2 ratios. The loss of the 10 W binding site largely abrogated the exon 9 inclusion and exon 10 skipping promoted by ISIS 461456 and ISIS 549197 (FIG. 2f and Table 6). In contrast, removal of the intron 9 homologous region did not block the effect of ISIS 461456 and ISIS 549197 on splicing. However, when both binding sites were removed, the effect of ISIS 461456 and ISIS 549197 was completely abrogated. The results indicate that ISIS 461456 and ISIS 549197 largely mediate exon 9 inclusion through the 10 W complementary region in exon 10.

V. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 107: 1894-1899, 2010; Bluemlein, K. et al., Oncotarget. 2: 393-400, 2011). Glioblastoma cells also have a higher basal level of PK-M1 mRNA, which is expected to facilitate the ASO-mediated PK-M splicing switch (Clower, C. V. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 107: 1894-1899, 2010). To compare the effect of ASOs targeting the 10 W region versus those targeting the SRSF3 region, side-by-side ASO transfections at final concentrations of 30 nM, 60 nM, and 90 nM in the glioblastoma cell lines A172 and U87-MG were conducted. ISIS 555158 was the ASO targeting the SRSF3 region that was chosen and was transfected at final concentrations of 60 or 90 nM. The control oligonucleotide was transfected at a final concentration of 90 nM. The experiment was run in triplicates. U87-MG and A172 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin, at 37° C. and 5% CO2. ASO transfections were conducted as described above. Radioactive RT-PCR and restriction digest of endogenous PK-M transcripts were performed 36 hrs after transfection. The results are presented in FIG. 3a, as well as in Tables 7 and 8. All standard deviations are ≦4% (n=3) As expected, there was a dose-dependent increase in exon 9 inclusion and exon 10 skipping in these cell lines, with ISIS 461456 and ISIS 549197 performing better than ISIS 555158. Consistent with the minigene experiments, treatment with ISIS 461456 resulted in greater increase in PK-M1 mRNA levels than treatment with other ASOs, whereas treatment with ISIS 549197 resulted in more double-skipped mRNA and a larger decrease in PK-M2 mRNA levels than treatment with other ASOs.

Cells were lysed in SDS, and total protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay. Total protein of 5-30 μg was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. This was followed by blocking with 5% (w/v) milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20, probing with antibodies and visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche). The primary antibodies used were β-actin (Genscript mAb, 1:10,000); PK-M2 (Cell Signaling Technology, rAb, 1:2,000); and PK-M1 (ProteinTech, rAb, 1:1,000). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit HRP conjugates (Bio-Rad, 1:20,000). The results are presented in FIG. 3b. A representative blot from one of three independent experiments is shown. As expected, PK-M1 and PK-M2 protein isoform levels closely mirrored their mRNA levels. There was detectable PK-M1 protein after transfection of each of the three ASOs, but ISIS 549197 resulted in the greatest decrease in PK-M2 levels. The data was also confirmed by immunofluorescence technique. Cells were first transfected with ASOs as described above and then plated on 4-well culture slides (BD Biosciences) 24-hrs post transfection. At 36 hrs post-transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. Cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min after washing in PBS, and then blocked for 20 min in blocking buffer (1% goat serum in PBS). The cells were then incubated overnight with rabbit monoclonal anti-PK-M2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). After washing 3 times with PBS, the cells were then incubated for 1 hr in blocking buffer containing Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen). Cells were analyzed using a Zeiss Axiopian.Z1 upright fluorescent microscope. Downregulation of PK-M2 protein was also observed when either ISIS 461456 or ISIS 549197, but not the control ASO, was transfected into A172 or U87-MG cells (FIG. 3c). Example 6 Effect of Antisense Inhibition of PK-M on Apoptosis in Glioblastoma Cells The effect of treatment with ASOs targeting PK-M on apoptosis of the glioblastoma cells was studied. Treatment with ISIS 549197 resulted in cleaved PARP as early as 24 hrs post-transfection in A172 cells, indicating that the cells were undergoing apoptosis. Cells were harvested 24 or 48 hrs after transfection, whereas the control cells were harvested after 48 hrs. The cells were lysed in SDS and total protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay. Total protein (5-30 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 and probed with PARP primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, rAb, 1:1,000). The bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Roche). The results are presented in FIG. 4. To confirm this observation, Annexin V staining assays were performed with A172 and U87-MG cells transfected with ISIS 460456, ISIS 549197, or ISIS 555158 at a final concentration of 90 nM. Cells (1×106 in number) were collected 36 hrs after transfection, washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 1× Binding Buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 140 mM NaCl; 2.5 mM CaCl2). The cells were then stained with 5 μl each of Annexin V-APC antibody and 7-AAD (Becton Dickinson) in the dark for 15 min, and analyzed for apoptosis for flow cytometry using an LSRII Cell Analyzer (Becton Dickinson). Both early apoptotic (7AAD−/Annexin V+) and late apoptotic (7AAD+/Annexin V+) cells were included in the quantification. The results are presented in FIG. 5a and Table 9, and are a representative of 3 biological triplicates each. Table 9 presents the percentage of Annexin V-positive cells, as indicated in the two right quadrants in each plot of the flow cytometric analysis. TABLE 9 Effect of ASO treatment on apoptosis in A172 glioblastoma cells ASO: Control ISIS 555158 ISIS 461456 ISIS 549197 A172 3 23 34 48 U87-MG 4 18 32 44 To confirm this finding, cells were transfected with ISIS 461456 or ISIS 549197 at 30 nM, 60 nM, or 90 nM or with ISIS 555158 at 60 nM or 90 nM. The control ASO was transfected at 90 nM. The data is presented in FIG. 5b and Tables 10 and 11. The proportion of Annexin V-positive cells increased in an ASO dose-dependent manner, indicating that ASO-mediated switching of PK-M splicing induces apoptosis in these cell lines. ISIS 549197 was the most potent in inducing apoptosis among the three ASOs tested.

To generate cell lines that over-express human PK-M1 isoform in a doxycycline-dependent manner, A172 cells were first infected with MSCV-rtTA-hygro virus, and selected in hygromycin for 2 weeks. Human PK-M1 cDNA was amplified from A172 cells transfected with ISIS 549197 using the following primer pair: hPKT7cDNAF (5′-GGGGAACTCGAGATGGCTTCTAGGATGGCATCGATGACAGGTGGCCAACAGATGGGCATGTCG AAGCCCCATAGTGAAGCCG-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 57) and hPKT7cDNAR (5′-GGGGAAGAATTCTCACGGCACAGGAACAACACGCATG-3′; designated SEQ ID NO: 58) with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes). The resulting amplicon containing the T7 tag was gel-purified and cloned between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the retroviral TtiGP plasmid.A172-rTA cells were then infected with TtiGP-PKM1 virus. To make cells lines constitutively over-express human PK-M2, PK-M2 cDNA from A172 cells were amplified using the same primers and cloned between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the retroviral PIG plasmid. A172 and U87-MG cells were then infected with the PIG-PKM2 virus. All infected cells were then selected with 100 μg/ml puromycin for 3 days. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm their identities. FIG. 6 a presents the immunoblot analysis of A172 cells stably transduced with rtTA and doxycycline-inducible human T7-tagged PK-M1 cDNA. FIG. 6b presents the immunoblot analysis of A172 and U87 cells stably transduced with T7-tagged human PK-M2 cDNA. Cells were grown in parallel with or without doxycycline, and harvested after 72 hrs. The cells were lysed and prepared for western blotting analysis, as described in an earlier Example. The primary antibodies used were PK-M1 (ProteinTech, rAb, 1:1,000), T7 (mAb, 1:1,000), PK-M2 (Cell Signaling Technology, rAb, 1:2,000) and β-actin (Genscript mAb, 1:10,000). To investigate the role of PK-M1 in ASO-mediated apoptosis, doxycycline was added to the PK-M1-inducible cells for three days, after which the cells were treated with ISIS 461456, ISIS 549197, or control ASO at 60 nM final concentrations. After 36 hrs, the cells were stained for Annexin V and analyzed by flow cytometry. The results are presented in FIG. 6c and Table 10. The histograms of FIG. 6c indicate the fold increase in Annexin V-positive cells, compared to the control ASO for each condition. The data indicate that there was a similar increase in the number of Annexin V-positive cells in the cells that did or did not overexpress PK-M1, suggesting that PK-M1 induction did not cause apoptosis in these cells. To investigate the role of PK-M2 downregulation in apoptosis, U87-MG and A172 cells overexpressing PK-M2 were treated with ISIS 461456, ISIS 549197, ISIS 555158, or control ASO at a final concentration of 90 nM. The cells were analyzed by immunoblotting as well as by Annexin V flow cytometry. The results are presented in FIGS. 6b and 6d, as well as Tables 12 and 13, and indicate that overexpression of PK-M2 in both cell lines rescued the cells from the ASO-mediated apoptosis, leading to the decrease in the number of Annexin V-positive cells to baseline levels. The histogram shown in FIG. 6d indicates the fold-increase in Annexin V-positive cells, compared to control ASO for each cell line.

Four siRNAs targeting exon 10 of human PKM2 were obtained from Sigma Genosys, and have sense-strand sequences 5′-CCAUAAUCGUCCGCACCAA-3′ (M2si1; designated SEQ ID NO: 59), 5′-CAUCUACCACUUGCAAUUA-3′ (M2si2; designated SEQ ID NO: 60), 5′-CCGUGGAGGCCUCCUUCAA-3′ (M2si3; designated SEQ ID NO: 61) and 5′-CUUGCAAUUAUUUGAGGAA-3′ (M2si4; designated SEQ ID NO: 62). A172 cells (4×106) in 6-well plates were transfected with 400 pmol of siRNA duplex using LipofectAMINE2000®. Cells were harvested 48 hr later. The results are presented in FIG. 7. Knockdown of PK-M2 also led to the appearance of cleaved PARP after 48 hrs. These observations confirm that the down-regulation of PK-M2 expression, but not the induction of PK-M1 expression, leads to apoptosis in glioblastoma cell lines. Example 9 Effect of 2′-O-Methoxyethyl Antisense Oligonucleotides on PK-M Splicing In Vivo The ASOs listed in Table 14 below were designed to target exon 10 of the mouse PK-M transcript comprising GENBANK Accession No. NT—039474.8 truncated from nucleotides 5923000 to 5949000 (designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 63). (Note that the human ASOs described herein target the complement of the human genomic PK-M sequence NT—010194.16 truncated from nucleotides 43281289 to 43314403, whereas the mouse ASOs target the mouse genomic sequence NT—039474.8 truncated from nucleotides 5923000 to 5949000 because the mouse sequence, SEQ ID: 63, corresponds to the non-coding strand of the mouse genomic DNA. In each case, the ASOs are complementary to the RNA transcript.) Each of the ASOs in Table 14 is also complementary to the human PK-M transcript with 0-3 mismatches. Each of the ASOs is 15 nucleotides in length, with uniform 2′-O-methoxyethyl ribose sugar residues, and uniform phosphorothioate internucleoside linkages. All the cytosine nucleobases are 5-methylcytosines. To examine the effects of antisense oligonucleotide treatment on endogenous PK-M transcripts in vivo, C57B1/6 wild-type (WT) mice were injected subcutaneously once per week for three weeks with one of the ASOs listed in Table 14 at 100 mg/kg or with PBS as a control. Each treatment group consisted of 4 animals. Four days after the administration of the last dose, the mice were sacrificed and tissues were collected. PK-M1 and PK-M2 mRNA levels in each of the mice's livers were determined using real-time PCR and RIBOGREEN® RNA quantification reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, Oreg.) according to standard protocols. Two mouse-specific primer probe sets were used to amplify endogenous PK-M1. The first primer set anneals to PK-M exons 8 and 9 (mPKMF: 5′-TGTCTGGAGAAACAGCCAAGG-3′, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 64; mPKMR: 5′-CAAGCTCTTCAAACAGCAGACG-3′, designated herein as SEQ ID NO:65; probe sequence: 5′-AGCACCTGATAGCTCGGGAGGC-3′, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 66).

Two mouse-specific primer probe sets were used to amplify endogenous PK-M2. The first PK-M2 primer set anneals to PK-M exons 8 and 10 (mPKMF: 5′-GGAGTTCCTCGAATAGCTGCAAG-3′, designated herein as SEQ ID NO:70; and mPKMR: 5′-AGTCCTGGATGGAGCAGACT-3′, designated herein as SEQ ID NO:71; probe sequence: 5′-GCTGTTCGCATGCAGCACCT-3′, designated herein as SEQ ID NO:72). The second PK-M2 primer set anneals to exons 10 and 11 (mPKMF: 5′-GCGAGCAGTCTGGGGATTTC-3′, designated herein as SEQ ID NO: 73; mPKMR: 5′-ACCCCACAGAAGCTGCC-3′, designated herein as SEQ ID NO:74; probe sequence: 5′-ACCAAGTCTGGCAGGAGTGCTC-3′, designated herein as SEQ ID NO:75). mRNA levels were determined relative to GAPDH prior to normalization to PBS-treated controls. The results in Table 15 are presented as the average percent of PK-M1 and PK-M2 mRNA levels for each treatment group, relative to the PK-M1 and PK-M2 mRNA levels of the PBS-treated control group, respectively, and are denoted as “% PBS”. The standard error for all PK-M1 results was ≦34%, and the standard error for all PK-M2 results was ≦6%. The results for each primer probe set are listed. “ND” indicates no data because the ASO targets a portion of the amplicon, thereby preventing primer binding and amplification. All of the ASOs were well tolerated, as assessed by liver weight and ALT and AST levels.
