Synthesis of 1-(3-(dimethylamino)azetidin-1-yl)-3-(1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one Hydrochloride
A solution of hydrogen chloride in diethyl ether (2.0 N, 0.650 mL, 1.30 mmol) was added to a solution of 1-(3-(dimethylamino)azetidin-1-yl)-3-(1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one (0.150 g, 0.493 mmol) in diethyl ether (6.0 mL) at 0Â° C. The reaction liquid was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour and then stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The white solid precipitated was filtered and collected, washed with diethyl ether and dried at room temperature to obtain 1-(3-(dimethylamino)azetidin-1-yl)-3-(1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)propan-1-one hydrochloride (0.137 g, 0.363 mmol, 74%)(hereinafter referred to as the compound of Example 19) as a white solid.
