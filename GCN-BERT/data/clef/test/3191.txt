TUBULYSIN DERIVATIVES BACKGROUND Tubulysins are a class of cytostatic tetrapeptides that were isolated from Myxobacteria (Sasse F et al J. Antibiotics, 2000, 879). The common features of the tubulysins are their tetrapeptidic structure, of which only He is naturally occurring amino acid and three others are complex unnatural amino acids: Mep (R-N-Mepipecolic acid), Tuv (tubuvaline) and Tut (tubulyrosine) or Tup (tubuphenylalanine). Later on additional members of the family were described (Steinmettz et al, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.2004, 4888). Most naturally occurring tubulysins showed pM cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines that correlated with tubulin- polymerization inhibition. The mechanism of action of tubulysins was described by Sasse (Khalil MW et al ChemBioChem, 2006, 678) which showed that Tubulysin A is more efficacious in inhibiting tubulin polymerization than other vinca domain of beta-tubulin binders (phomopsin, dolastatin and hemiasterlin). Naturally occurring tubulysins showed consistent higher toxicity than dolastatin. Furthermore Tubulysin A was reported (Kaur G et al, Biochem. J, 2006, 235) to induce apoptosis in cancer cell lines and showed antiangio genie activity in addition to potent antitumor activity in animal models. Following these findings considerable effort was invested into finding synthetic analogs with comparable potency to naturally occurring tubulysins. The presence of Ν,Ο-acetal-containing-Tuv has posed a challenge to synthesizing tubulysins and led to concerns regarding their stability. Several groups identified synthetic analogs that replaced the Ν,Ο-acetal with a plain methyl group without significant loss of cytotoxic activity (Patterson, A et al, Chem. Eur. J. 2007, 9534; Wipf P et al Org. Lett. 2007, 1605). Several reports disclose conjugates of tubulysins with folate (Leamon CP et al, Cancer Res. 2008, 9839), cyclodextrin nano-conjugates (Schluep TS et al Clin. Cancer Res. 2009, 15: 181) as well as dendrimer conjugates (Floyd WC, ChemMedChem 2011, 49). One report discloses conjugation of tubulysins to monoclonal antibodies (US2011/0027274). Novel tubulysin derivatives may be useful as cytotoxic agents to provide therapeutic benefits in the treatment of various types of cancers, alone, as drug conjugates or in combination with other chemotherapies.

In order that the present invention can be more readily understood, certain terms are first defined. Additional definitions are set forth throughout the detailed description. The foregoing written specification is considered to be sufficient to enable one skilled in the art to practice the embodiments. The foregoing description and Examples detail certain embodiments and describes the best mode contemplated by the inventors. It will be appreciated, however, that no matter how detailed the foregoing may appear in text, the embodiments may be practiced in many ways and the claims include any equivalents thereof. Before describing the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to specific compositions or process steps, as such can vary. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The terms "a" (or "an"), as well as the terms "one or more," and "at least one" can be used interchangeably herein. Furthermore, "and/or" where used herein is to be taken as specific disclosure of each of the two specified features or components with or without the other. Thus, the term and/or" as used in a phrase such as "A and/or B" herein is intended to include "A and B," "A or B," "A" (alone), and "B" (alone). Likewise, the term "and/or" as used in a phrase such as "A, B, and/or C" is intended to encompass each of the following aspects: A, B, and C; A, B, or C; A or C; A or B; B or C; A and C; A and B; B and C; A (alone); B (alone); and C (alone). Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure is related. For example, the Concise Dictionary of Biomedicine and Molecular Biology, Juo, Pei- Show, 2nd ed., 2002, CRC Press; The Dictionary of Cell and Molecular Biology, 3rd ed., 1999, Academic Press; and the Oxford Dictionary Of Biochemistry And Molecular Biology, Revised, 2000, Oxford University Press, provide one of skill with a general dictionary of many of the terms used in this disclosure. Units, prefixes, and symbols are denoted in their Systeme International de Unites (SI) accepted form. Numeric ranges are inclusive of the numbers defining the range. Unless otherwise indicated, amino acid sequences are written left to right in amino to carboxy orientation. The headings provided herein are not limitations of the various aspects, which can be had by reference to the specification as a whole. Accordingly, the terms defined immediately below are more fully defined by reference to the specification in its entirety. It is understood that wherever aspects are described herein with the language "comprising," otherwise analogous aspects described in terms of "consisting of and/or "consisting essentially of are also provided. Amino acids are referred to herein by either their commonly known three letter symbols or by the one-letter symbols recommended by the IUPAC-RJB Biochemical Nomenclature Commission. The terms "inhibit," "block," and "suppress" are used interchangeably herein and refer to any statistically significant decrease in biological activity, including full blocking of the activity. For example, "inhibition" can refer to a decrease of about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 100% in biological activity. Cellular proliferation can be assayed using art recognized techniques which measure rate of cell division, and/or the fraction of cells within a cell population undergoing cell division, and/or rate of cell loss from a cell population due to terminal differentiation or cell death (e.g., thymidine incorporation). The terms "antibody" or "immunoglobulin," as used interchangeably herein, include whole antibodies and any antigen binding fragment or single chains thereof and combinations thereof (e.g., bispecific antibodies). A typical antibody comprises at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains interconnected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is comprised of a heavy chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH) and a heavy chain constant region (abbreviated herein as CH). The heavy chain constant region is comprised of three domains, CHI , CH2, and CH3. Each light chain is comprised of a light chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL) and a light chain constant region. The light chain constant region is comprised of one domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed Complementarity Determining Regions (CDR), interspersed with regions that are more conserved, termed framework regions (FW). Each VH and VL is composed of three CDRs and four FWs, arranged from amino -terminus to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FW1 , CDR1 , FW2, CDR2, FW3, CDR3, FW4. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions of the antibodies can mediate the binding of the immunoglobulin to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system. Exemplary antibodies of the present disclosure include typical antibodies, scFvs, and combinations thereof where, for example, an scFv is covalently linked (for example, via peptidic bonds or via a chemical linker) to the N-terminus of either the heavy chain and/or the light chain of a typical antibody, or intercalated in the heavy chain and/or the light chain of a typical antibody. The term "antibody" means an immunoglobulin molecule that recognizes and specifically binds to a target, such as a protein, polypeptide, peptide, carbohydrate, polynucleotide, lipid, or combinations of the foregoing through at least one antigen recognition site within the variable region of the immunoglobulin molecule. As used herein, the term "antibody" encompasses intact polyclonal antibodies, intact monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments (such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments), single chain variable fragment (scFv), disulfide stabilized scFvs, multispecific antibodies such as bispecific antibodies generated from at least two intact antibodies and/or antigen binding fragments thereof, chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, human antibodies, fusion proteins comprising an antigen determination portion of an antibody, and any other modified immunoglobulin molecule comprising an antigen recognition site so long as the antibodies exhibit the desired biological activity. An antibody can be of any the five major classes of immunoglobulins: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, or subclasses (isotypes) thereof (e.g. IgGl , IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgAl and IgA2), based on the identity of their heavy-chain constant domains referred to as alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu, respectively. The different classes of immunoglobulins have different and well known subunit structures and three-dimensional configurations. Antibodies can be naked or conjugated to other molecules such as toxins, radioisotopes, etc. to form ADCs. The terms "antigen binding fragment" refers to a portion of an intact antibody and refers to the antigenic determining variable regions of an intact antibody. It is known in the art that the antigen binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include, but are not limited to Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, and Fv fragments, linear antibodies, single chain antibodies, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. A "monoclonal antibody" refers to a homogeneous antibody population involved in the highly specific recognition and binding of a single antigenic determinant, or epitope. This is in contrast to polyclonal antibodies that typically include different antibodies directed against different antigenic determinants. The term "monoclonal antibody" encompasses both intact and full-length monoclonal antibodies as well as antibody fragments (such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fv), single chain variable fragments (scFv), fusion proteins comprising an antibody portion, and any other modified immunoglobulin molecule comprising an antigen recognition site. Furthermore, "monoclonal antibody" refers to such antibodies made in any number of ways including, but not limited to, by hybridoma, phage selection, recombinant expression, and transgenic animals (e.g. , expression of a human antibody in a transgenic mouse). The term "humanized antibody" refers to an antibody derived from a non-human (e.g. , murine) immunoglobulin, which has been engineered to contain minimal non-human (e.g., murine) sequences. Typically, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins in which residues from the CDRs are replaced by residues from the CDRs of a non-human species (e.g. , mouse, rat, rabbit, or hamster) that have the desired specificity, affinity, and capability (Jones et al., 1986, Nature, 321 :522-525; Riechmann et al., 1988, Nature, 332:323-327; Verhoeyen et al., 1988, Science, 239: 1534-1536). In some instances, the FW residues of a human immunoglobulin are replaced with the corresponding residues in an antibody from a non-human species that has the desired specificity, and/or affinity, and/or capability. The term "antibody-drug conjugate" (ADC) refers to a conjugate comprising at least one antibody binding to an epitope of interest conjugated to least one compound of Formula I or compound of Formula II. Compounds of Formula I and compounds of Formula II may be conjugated to antibodies to form antibody drug conjugates. (ADC) whereby compounds of Formula I and compounds of Formula II, may serve as therapeutic moieties which are delivered to a therapeutic target of interest by the antibody to which they are conjugated. In some aspects, the ADC comprises two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine or ten therapeutic moieties. In some specific aspects, the ADC comprises two, three, or four therapeutic moieties. In some aspects, all therapeutic moieties are the same. In some aspects, at least one therapeutic moiety is different from the rest. A therapeutic moiety refers to a single molecule of a compound of Formula I or a single molecule of a compound of Formula II. The term "subject" refers to any animal (e.g., a mammal), including, but not limited to humans, non-human primates, rodents, and the like, which is to be the recipient of a particular treatment. Typically, the terms "subject" and "patient" are used interchangeably herein in reference to a human subject. The term "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a preparation which is in such form as to permit the biological activity of the active ingredient, and which contains no additional components which are unacceptably toxic to a subject to which the composition would be administered. Such composition can be sterile. Terms such as "treating" or "treatment" or "to treat" or "alleviating" or "to alleviate" refer to both (1) therapeutic measures that cure, slow down, lessen symptoms of, and/or halt progression of a diagnosed pathologic condition or disorder and (2) prophylactic or preventative measures that prevent and/or slow the development of a targeted pathologic condition or disorder. Thus, those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder; those prone to have the disorder; and those in whom the disorder is to be prevented. In certain aspects, a subject is successfully "treated" for cancer according to the methods of the present disclosure if the patient shows, e.g., total, partial, or transient remission of a certain type of cancer. The terms "cancer", "tumor", "cancerous", and "malignant" refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancers include but are not limited to, carcinoma including adenocarcinomas, lymphomas, blastomas, melanomas, sarcomas, and leukemias. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell cancer, small-cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, glioma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, liver cancer such as hepatic carcinoma and hepatoma, bladder cancer, breast cancer (including hormonally mediated breast cancer, see, e.g., Innes et al. (2006) Br. J. Cancer 94: 1057-1065), colon cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial carcinoma, myeloma (such as multiple myeloma), salivary gland carcinoma, kidney cancer such as renal cell carcinoma and Wilms' tumors, basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, prostate cancer, vulval cancer, thyroid cancer, testicular cancer, esophageal cancer, various types of head and neck cancer and cancers of mucinous origins, such as, mucinous ovarian cancer, cholangiocarcinoma (liver) and renal papillary carcinoma. The term "cytotoxic agent" as used herein is defined broadly and refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and/or causes destruction of cells (cell death), and/or exerts anti-neoplastic/anti-proliferative effects. For example, cytotoxic agent prevents directly or indirectly the development, maturation, or spread of neoplastic tumor cells. The term includes also such agents that cause a cytostatic effect only and not a mere cytotoxic effect. The term includes chemotherapeutic agents as specified below, as well as other HER2 antagonists, anti- angiogenic agents, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, protein kinase A inhibitors, members of the cytokine family, radioactive isotopes, and toxins such as enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin. The term "chemotherapeutic agent" is a subset of the term "cytotoxic agent" comprising natural or synthetic chemical compounds. Examples of chemotherapeutic or agents include alkylating agents, for example, nitrogen mustards, ethyleneimine compounds, alkyl sulphonates and other compounds with an alkylating action such as nitrosoureas, cisplatin and dacarbazine; antimetabolites, for example, folic acid, purine or pyrimidine antagonists; mitotic inhibitors, for example, Vinca alkaloids and derivatives of podophyllotoxin; cytotoxic antibiotics and camptothecin derivatives. Other chemotherapeutic agents are amifostine (ETHYOL®), cisplatin, dacarbazine (DTIC), dactinomycin, mechlorethamine (nitrogen mustard), streptozocin, cyclophosphamide, carrnustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU), doxorubicin (AD IAMYCIN®), doxorubicin lipo (DOXIL®), gemcitabine (GEMZAR®), daunorubicin, daunorubicin lipo (DAUNOXOME®), procarbazine, mitomycin, cytarabine, etoposide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), vinblastine, vincristine, bleomycin, paclitaxel (TAXOL®), docetaxel (TAXOTERE®), aldesleukin, asparaginase, busulfan, carboplatin, cladribine, camptothecin, CPT-11, 10-hydroxy- 7-ethyl-camptothecin (SN38), gefitinib (IRESSA®), dacarbazine, floxuridine, fludarabine, hydroxyurea, ifosfamide, idarubicin, mesna, interferon alpha, interferon beta, irinotecan, mitoxantrone, topotecan, leuprolide, megestrol, melphalan, mercaptopurine, plicamycin, mitotane, pegaspargase, pentostatin, pipobroman, plicamycin, streptozocin, tamoxifen, teniposide, testolactone, thioguanine, thiotepa, uracil mustard, vinorelbine, chlorambucil aromatase inhibitors, and combinations thereof. In accordance with the methods of the present disclosure, compounds and ADCs of the present disclosure may be administered to a patient to promote a positive therapeutic response with respect to cancer. The term "positive therapeutic response" with respect to cancer treatment refers to an improvement in the symptoms associated with the disease. For example, an improvement in the disease can be characterized as a complete response. The term "complete response" refers to an absence of clinically detectable disease with normalization of any previously test results. Alternatively, an improvement in the disease can be categorized as being a partial response. A "positive therapeutic response" encompasses a reduction or inhibition of the progression and/or duration of cancer, the reduction or amelioration of the severity of cancer, and/or the amelioration of one or more symptoms thereof resulting from the administration of compounds of the present disclosure. In specific aspects, such terms refer to one, two or three or more results following the administration of compounds of the instant disclosure: (1) a stabilization, reduction or elimination of the cancer cell population; (2) a stabilization or reduction in cancer growth; (3) an impairment in the formation of cancer; (4) eradication, removal, or control of primary, regional and/or metastatic cancer; (5) a reduction in mortality; (6) an increase in disease-free, relapse-free, progression-free, and/or overall survival, duration, or rate; (7) an increase in the response rate, the durability of response, or number of patients who respond or are in remission; (8) a decrease in hospitalization rate, (9) a decrease in hospitalization lengths, (10) the size of the cancer is maintained and does not increase or increases by less than 10%, preferably less than 5%, preferably less than 4%, preferably less than 2%, and (11) an increase in the number of patients in remission. (12) a decrease in the number of adjuvant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy or hormonal therapy) that would otherwise be required to treat the cancer. Clinical response can be assessed using screening techniques such as PET, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, x-radiographic imaging, computed tomographic (CT) scan, flow cytometry or fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, histology, gross pathology, and blood chemistry, including but not limited to changes detectable by ELISA, RIA, chromatography, and the like. In addition to these positive therapeutic responses, the subject undergoing therapy can experience the beneficial effect of an improvement in the symptoms associated with the disease. The compounds of the instant disclosure can be used in combination with any known therapies for cancer, including any agent or combination of agents that are known to be useful, or which have been used or are currently in use, for treatment of cancer, e.g., colon cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck squamous cells cancer, and breast cancer. Anticancer agents include drugs used to treat malignancies, such as cancerous growths. Drug therapy can be used alone, or in combination with other treatments such as surgery or radiation therapy. Several classes of drugs can be used in cancer treatment, depending on the nature of the organ involved. For example, breast cancers are commonly stimulated by estrogens, and can be treated with drugs which inactive the sex hormones. Similarly, prostate cancer can be treated with drugs that inactivate androgens, the male sex hormone. Anti-cancer agents for use in certain methods of the present disclosure include, among others, antibodies, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, topoisomerase inhibitors, microtubule targeting agents, kinase inhibitors, protein synthesis inhibitors, immunotherapeutic agents, hormonal therapies, glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, chemotherapeutic agents, protein kinase B inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, RLr9, CD289, enzyme inhibitors, anti-TRAIL, MEK inhibitors, and the like. Where the combined therapies comprise administration compounds of the present disclosure in combination with administration of another therapeutic agent, the methods of the instant disclosure encompass co-administration, using separate formulations or a single pharmaceutical formulation, and consecutive administration in either order. In some aspects, the compounds of Formula I, compounds of Formula II, and/or ADCs described herein are administered in combination with other drugs, wherein the antibody or antigen-binding fragment, variant, or derivative thereof and the therapeutic agent(s) can be administered sequentially, in either order, or simultaneously (i.e., concurrently or within the same time frame). The combination therapy can provide "synergy" and prove "synergistic", i.e., the effect achieved when the active ingredients used together is greater than the sum of the effects that results from using the compounds separately. A synergistic effect can be attained when the active ingredients are: (1) co-formulated and administered or delivered simultaneously in a combined, unit dosage formulation; (2) delivered by alternation or in parallel as separate formulations; or (3) by some other regimen. When delivered in alternation therapy, a synergistic effect can be attained when the compounds are administered or delivered sequentially, e.g., by different injections in separate syringes. In general, during alternation therapy, an effective dosage of each active ingredient is administered sequentially, i.e., serially, whereas in combination therapy, effective dosages of two or more active ingredients are administered together. Compounds and ADCs of the present disclosure (therapeutic agents) may be administered to a patient oral, parenteral, by inhalation or topical routes. The term parenteral as used herein includes, e.g., intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, rectal, or vaginal administration. However, in other methods compatible with the teachings herein, ADC can be used to selectively target compounds of the present invention to deliver the therapeutic agents directly to the site of the adverse cellular population thereby increasing the exposure of the diseased tissue to the therapeutic agent. As discussed herein, therapeutic agents of the present disclosure can be administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable composition for the in vivo treatment of cancers. Typically, compounds of the present disclosure will be formulated as solutions for intravenous administration or as lyophilized concentrates for reconstitution to prepare intravenous solutions (such as with saline, 5% dextrose, or similar isotonic solutions). The pharmaceutical compositions can comprise pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, including, e.g., water, ion exchangers, proteins, buffer substances, and salts. Preservatives and other additives can also be present. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium. Suitable formulations for use in the therapeutic methods disclosed herein are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co.) 16th ed. (1980). In any case, sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating therapeutic agents of the present disclosure in the required amount in an appropriate solvent followed by filtered sterilization. Further, the preparations can be packaged and sold in the form of a kit. Such articles of manufacture can have labels or package inserts indicating that the associated compositions are useful for treating a subject suffering from, or predisposed to a disease or disorder. Parenteral formulations can be a single bolus dose, an infusion or a loading bolus dose followed with a maintenance dose. These compositions can be administered at specific fixed or variable intervals, e.g., once a day, or on an "as needed" basis. The composition can be administered as a single dose, multiple doses or over an established period of time in an infusion. Dosage regimens also can be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response {e.g., a therapeutic or prophylactic response). Therapeutically effective doses of the compositions of the present disclosure, for treatment of cancers including e.g., colon cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck squamous cells cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer, vary depending upon many different factors, including means of administration, target site, physiological state of the patient, whether the patient is human or an animal, other medications administered, and whether treatment is prophylactic or therapeutic. Usually, the patient is a human, but non-human mammals including transgenic mammals can also be treated. Treatment dosages can be titrated using routine methods known to those of skill in the art to optimize safety and efficacy. The amount of therapeutic agent of the present disclosure to be administered can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation. Factors influencing the mode of administration and the respective amount of agent, include, but are not limited to, the severity of the disease, the history of the disease, and the age, height, weight, health, and physical condition of the individual undergoing therapy. Similarly, the amount of anti-HER2 binding molecule, e.g. , antibody, or fragment, variant, or derivative thereof, to be administered will be dependent upon the mode of administration and whether the subject will undergo a single dose or multiple doses of this agent. The present disclosure also provides for the use of a therapeutic agent of the disclosure, in the manufacture of a medicament for treating a type of cancer, including, e.g., breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck squamous cells cancer, melanoma, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer. The disclosure also provides for the use of a therapeutic agent of the disclosure, in the manufacture of a medicament for treating a subject for treating a type of cancer. In certain aspects, the medicament is used in a subject that has been pretreated with at least one other therapy. By "pretreated" or "pretreatment" is intended the subject has received one or more other therapies (e.g. , been treated with at least one other anti-cancer therapy) prior to receiving the medicament comprising compounds of the instant disclosure. It is not necessary that the subject was a responder to pretreatment with the prior therapy or therapies. Thus, the subject that receives the medicament could have responded, or could have failed to respond to pretreatment with the prior therapy, or to one or more of the prior therapies where pretreatment comprised multiple therapies. The instant disclosure also provides for the co-administration of the therapeutic agent and at least one other therapy, together in a single composition or co-administered together at the same time or overlapping times in separate compositions. The instant disclosure also provides for the use of the therapeutic agent in the manufacture of a medicament for treating a subject for treating cancer, wherein the agent is administered before a subject has been treated with at least one other therapy.

General Description of Conjugation ADCs containing antibodies may be prepared by standard methods such as , but not limited to aldehyde/Schiff linkage, sulfhydryl linkage, acid-labile linkage, cis-aconityl linkage, hydrazone linkage, by methods analogous to those described by Hamblett, Clin. Cancer Res. 2004, 10, 7063-7070; Doronina et al, Nat. Biotechnol. 2003, 21(7), 778-784 and Francisco et al, Blood, 2003, 102, 1458-1465, and appropriate modification of the following non- limiting example. Antibody is treated by under reducing conditions using 40 molar equivalent TCEP in PBS pH 7.2 and ImM EDTA for 3 hours at 37 °C to remove thiol-reactive species such as cysteine, glutathione, metals and reduce the interchain disulfide bonds in the antibody. This step is followed by two rounds of dialysis in PBS pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA at 4 °C using 10,000 MWCO dialysis cassettes (Thermo Scientific). The disulfide bonds are reformed by oxidation with dehydroascorbic acid over the antibody for 4 hours at 25 °C in PBS pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA. Thereafter, 20 molar equivalents of compound of Formula II is conjugated via the reactive thiol group of the antibody by incubating for 1 hour at 25 °C in PBS pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 10% v/v DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide) (Thermo Scientific).. The conjugates are purified by filtration. The conjugation reaction is quenched by adding 4 molar equivalents of N-acetyl cysteine (Sigma- Aldrich). The antibody-drug conjugates is dialyzed at 4°C overnight using 20K MWCO cassette in 5 mM NaP04, pH 6, and subsequently purified using 5 mL ceramix hydroxyapatite (CHT) type II cartridge (Biorad). The conjugates are eluted from the cartridge using 10 mM NaP04 pH 6 and a 0 to 2 M NaCl linear gradient and can be concentrated and formulated by buffer exchange using dialysis in 20 mM Histidine-HCl, pH 6.0. In Vitro Proliferation Assay A panel of human cancer cell lines (DU 145, NCI-N87, and MDA-MB-361) obtained from the American Type Tissue Collection (ATCC) (P.O. Box 1549, Manassa, VA 20108 (USA)) were used to determine the relative cytotoxicity of tubulysin compounds of the invention. The cells were plated in culture media at a density of 2,000 to 5,000 per well of tissue-culture-treated 96-well plates in a volume of 80μ1 and allowed to adhere overnight. A 5X concentration of each compound tested was prepared by diluting the test articles in culture medium. Twenty microliters of each test article was added to cells in duplicate or triplicate such that the final dose curve ranged from 4μg/ml down to 61pg/ml in a stepwise 1 :4 serial dilution series. The treated cells were cultured at 37°C / 5% C02 for 72 to 144 hours. The CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Viability Assay from Promega was used to determine relative cytotoxicity. Briefly, ΙΟΟμΙ of CellTiter-Glo reagent was added to each well, allowed to incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature with mild shaking and then the absorbance of each sample at 560nM was read using a Perkin Elmer En Vision luminometer. The percent cell viability was calculated by the following formula: (average luminescence of treated samples/average luminescence of control (untreated) samples) x 100. IC50 values were determined using logistic non- linear regression analysis with GraphPad Prism software. Not all compounds were assayed against all cell lines. Table I provides data for the assay.
