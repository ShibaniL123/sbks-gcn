RELATED CASES This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/710,627, filed on Oct. 5, 2012, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. BACKGROUND 1. Field The present disclosure relates to generally identification of various biomarkers associated with diabetic nephropathy. Several embodiments relate to the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy and more specifically, the present disclosure relates to the identification and use of mRNAs isolated from exosomes derived from urine and their use in the recognition and ongoing monitoring of diabetic nephropathy. 2. Description of Related Art Broadly speaking, the kidney functions to filter the blood of various metabolic waste products and excess water. Every day, an adult's kidneys filter about 200 quarts of blood resulting in generation and excretion of about 2 quarts of waste products and extra water. The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, and each kidney comprises about 1 million nephrons. Within each nephron is a glomerulus, which acts as the filtering mechanism, which keeps normal proteins and/or cells in the blood stream, and allows the excess water and waste to pass through to be processed by the remainder of the nephron (e.g., either concentrated or diluted). While some loss of kidney function can be tolerated—many individuals can lead normal lives with just one kidney—in many cases the cause of the reduction in kidney function is due to progressive disease or damage. In extreme cases, the progressive loss of kidney function results in the need for renal replacement therapy, such as dialysis or even kidney transplant. Two of the most common causes of loss of kidney function are diabetes and high blood pressure. According to recent data from the American Diabetes Association, over 8% of the United States population is diabetic. Over 200,000 people were living on chronic dialysis or with kidney transplant, due to end-stage kidney disease caused by diabetes. This comes at an extraordinary cost, not only to the patient's themselves, but to their family and the healthcare system. SUMMARY In several embodiments, there is provided a method for identifying a subject likely to develop or currently affected by diabetic nephropathy, the method comprising obtaining a sample of urine from a subject, wherein the sample comprises vesicles that are associated with RNA, isolating the vesicles from the sample, lysing the vesicles to release the vesicle-associated RNA, wherein the vesicle-associated RNA comprises an RNA associated with diabetes-induced damage to the nephron, wherein the RNA associated with diabetes-induced damage to the nephron is selected from the group consisting of PPARGC1A, SMAD1, UMOD, NRF2, SLC12A1 and CD24, quantifying the RNA associated with diabetes-induced damage to the nephron, comparing the amount of the RNA associated with diabetes-induced damage to the nephron from the subject to the quantity of a corresponding RNA from individuals having normal kidney function, and identifying a subject as likely to develop or currently affected by diabetic nephropathy when there is a difference in the quantity of the RNA associated with diabetes-induced damage to the nephron between the subject and the quantity of the RNA in individuals with normal kidney function.

In several embodiments, the detection can be achieved prior to detection by non-nucleic acid detection methods. In several embodiments, there is provided a method for advising a subject to undertake a therapy regime for diabetic nephropathy, comprising ordering a test of the subject's urine, the test comprising obtaining a sample of urine from a subject, wherein the sample comprises vesicles that are associated with RNA, isolating the vesicles from the sample, lysing the vesicles to release the vesicle-associated RNA, wherein the vesicle-associated RNA comprises an RNA associated with diabetes-induced damage to the nephron, wherein the RNA associated with diabetes-induced damage to the nephron is selected from the group consisting of PPARGC1A, SMAD1, UMOD, NRF2, SLC12A1 and CD24, quantifying the RNA associated with diabetes-induced damage to the nephron, comparing the amount of the RNA associated with diabetes-induced damage to the nephron from the subject to the quantity of a corresponding RNA from individuals having normal kidney function, characterizing the subject as likely to develop or currently affected by diabetic nephropathy when there is a difference in the quantity of the RNA associated with diabetes-induced damage to the nephron between the subject and the quantity of the RNA in individuals with normal kidney function, and advising the subject to undertake a therapy for diabetic nephropathy when characterized as likely to develop or currently affected by diabetic nephropathy.

In several embodiments, the quantifying of the RNA is achieved by using a method selected from the group consisting of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR, RNA sequencing, northern blotting, fluorescence activated cell sorting, ELISA, and mass spectrometry. Other quantification methods may also optionally be used. In several embodiments, the quantifying comprises use of real-time RT-PCR. In several embodiments, differences in the quantity of an RNA associated with diabetes-induced damage to the nephron are correlated with one or more non-molecular indicators of diabetic nephropathy. In such embodiments, an initial, molecular diagnosis can be corroborated through the use of non-molecular means. In several embodiments, the RNA associated with diabetes-induced damage to the nephron is selected from the group consisting of PPARGC1A, SMAD1, UMOD, and SLC12A1. In several embodiments, these markers are not otherwise expressed or detectable until identified using the methods disclosed herein, thereby allowing early detection of damage to the nephron (e.g., prior to manifestation of established symptoms). In several embodiments, the isolation of the vesicles from the sample comprises filtering the urine. In several embodiments, the filtration traps the vesicles on the filter. The lysing is performed while the vesicles are trapped on the filter. In several embodiments, the methods further comprise centrifuging the urine sample (or samples) to remove cellular debris. In several embodiments, centrifugation is performed prior to isolating the vesicles. In several embodiments, the methods comprise concentrating the vesicles further by filtering the supernatant of the centrifuged urine. In several embodiments, the diabetic nephropathy is due to Type I or Type II diabetes. In some embodiments, the Type I or Type II diabetes has not yet been diagnosed. In several embodiments, the RNA associated with diabetes-induced damage to the nephron comprises poly(A)+RNA. In several embodiments, the methods disclosed herein are used to screen a plurality of subjects to determine their likelihood of developing diabetic nephropathy and/or to detect early stage diabetic nephropathy. In several embodiments, the methods further comprise treating the subjects for prevent and/or treat diabetic nephropathy. Additionally, there are provided, in several embodiments, kits for detection of diabetic nephropathy. For example, in several embodiments, there is provided a kit for detection of early stage diabetic nephropathy, comprising (a) a reverse transcriptase enzyme for generating complementary DNA (cDNA) from RNA isolated from a urine sample of a subject being evaluated for their diabetic nephropathy status, (b) at least one pair of sense and antisense primers specific for one of PPARGC1A, SMAD1, UMOD, NRF2, SLC12A1 and CD24, and (c) a DNA polymerase for generating amplified DNA from the cDNA. In several embodiments, the kit further comprises a filter for capturing vesicles from the urine sample. In several embodiments, the kit further comprises a lysis buffer for liberating RNA from the vesicles. In several embodiments, the kit further comprises an elution buffer for transporting RNA from the lysed vesicles to an analysis vessel. In several embodiments, the kit additionally comprises a microplate configured to receive the RNA. In some embodiments, the microplate comprises oligo(dT) in each well of the plate. In several embodiments, the kit further comprises a DNA amplification buffer comprising Tris-HCl, magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, and adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine nucleotides. In several embodiments, the kit further comprises at least one fluorescent probe complementary to a region within the amplified DNA of one of PPARGC1A, SMAD1, UMOD, NRF2, SLC12A1 and CD24. In several such embodiments, the kit optionally comprises a means for detecting the fluorescent probe. In several embodiments, the kits enable the detection of diabetes-induced damage to the nephron. In several embodiments, the diabetes-induced damage to the nephron is correlated with one or more non-molecular indicators of diabetic nephropathy. In several embodiments, the kit further comprises control DNA indicating expression levels of one of PPARGC1A, SMAD1, UMOD, NRF2, SLC12A1 and CD24 in the absence of diabetic nephropathy. In several embodiments, the kits are suitable for detecting diabetic nephropathy that is due to Type I or Type II diabetes. In several embodiments, advantageously, the kits are able to detect diabetic nephropathy when associated Type I or Type II diabetes has not yet been diagnosed. The methods summarized above and set forth in further detail below describe certain actions taken by a practitioner; however, it should be understood that they can also include the instruction of those actions by another party. Thus, actions such as “administering a blood test” include “instructing the administration of a blood test.” BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES FIGS. 1A-1H depict analysis of mRNA levels from control and diabetic patients. FIGS. 2A-2H depict analysis of mRNA levels correlated with blood levels of HbA1c. FIGS. 3A-3H depict analysis of mRNA levels correlated with serum creatinine levels. DETAILED DESCRIPTION General Interpretation of a patient's symptoms, evaluation of their medical history and performance of a physical exam are typically used to generate an initial diagnosis, which is often corroborated with one or more medical tests. Many diagnostic medical tests are performed on blood extracted from a patient, as obtaining the sample is a relatively non-invasive. Tests may measure concentrations of certain molecules in the sample, which are then compared to normal concentrations (e.g., healthy ranges) or to concentrations measured in a prior sample from the patient. Other tests may also be available to evaluate kidney function, such as measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or clearance of certain pharmacological marker compounds (e.g., analysis of urine samples over time). Another prognostic marker for kidney function is proteinuria, an elevated level of protein in the urine. Increasing amounts of proteins (such as albumin) in the urine indicate progressively increasing amounts of kidney damage, and associated loss of function. Unfortunately, many diagnostic tests are only sufficiently sensitive to detect measurable increases in a molecule (or molecules) associated with a disease or injury at such a time when significant disease progression or injury has already occurred. For example, in the context of evaluating kidney function, plasma concentrations of molecules such as creatinine or urea (waste substances that should be removed by a functional kidney) often will not be raised above the normal range until a substantial amount (e.g., 40% or greater) of total kidney function is lost. Some of the assays described above rely on antigen-based detection of a marker or molecule, which can introduce some limitations with respect to sensitivity of the assay. Some assays employ more simplistic chemical reactions (e.g., colorimetric changes) to identify markers from blood or other fluid samples, however, these too may suffer from limitations of sensitivity. Questionable assay accuracy at low assay target concentration ranges significantly limits the ability of these assays to detect early stages of disease of injury that compromise kidney function. Thus, there exists a need for a sensitive, accurate and reproducible diagnostic test for evaluating kidney function that enable early detection and/or diagnosis of compromised kidney function. Vesicle-Associated RNA As discussed in more detail below, several embodiments of the methods disclosed herein are based on the identification of specific nucleic acids that are markers of disease or injury to the kidney. Advantageously, the nucleic acid-based methods provide a higher degree of sensitivity than the alternative assays disclosed above. In several embodiments, the nucleic acids are isolated from cells that are obtained from a blood or urine sample. In other embodiments, the nucleic acids exist extracellularly and are collected in a cell-free preparation. While several embodiments disclosed herein are directed to the isolation of RNA associated with vesicles present in patient urine samples, in several embodiments, RNA (and the associated markers) that are normally found in blood or plasma are isolated from urine samples. In some embodiments, these blood-borne markers are present in the urine due to damage or disease of the kidney that has compromised the normal blood filtering function of the kidney. In several embodiments disclosed herein, there are provided methods for the capture of RNA from a sample of patient body fluid and subsequent analysis of that RNA for disease and/or tissue specific markers. In several embodiments, the method comprises isolated of vesicles associated with RNA from a patient urine sample. In other embodiments, vesicles are obtained from plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, sputum, saliva, mucus, tears etc. Many diagnostic tests are designed around using a small patient fluid sample, and in some embodiments, a small amount (e.g. 15-50 mL of urine) is used. However, several embodiments are particularly advantageous because large volumes of patient urine are readily available. As described below, in some embodiments, the nucleic acids are vesicle-associated. In some embodiments, the nucleic acids detected are indicative of kidney disease and/or function (e.g., they not normally present in the urine of subject's having normal kidney function). In some embodiments, the detection of the nucleic acids is associated with severity and/or progression of kidney disease or injury (e.g., the nucleic acids are present in the patient urine sample at a greater or lesser concentration as compared to a population of individuals known to have normal kidney function). In some embodiments, urine is collected and nucleic acids are evaluated over time (e.g., to monitor a patient's response to therapy or disease progression). According to various embodiments, various methods to quantify RNA are used, including Northern blot analysis, RNAse protection assay, PCR, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, branched-DNA amplification, ELISA, mass spectrometry, CHIP-sequencing, and DNA or RNA microarray analysis. RNA (and other nucleic acids) are typically within the intracellular environment. However, certain nucleic acids exist extracellularly. For example, in several embodiments, the methods involve collection and analysis of naked extracellular nucleic acids (e.g., naked RNA). This is advantageous in several embodiments because, typically, the extracellular environment that comprises substantial quantities of RNAses leads to rapid degradation of the nucleic acids. In several embodiments, nucleic acids are associated with extracellular vesicles. In several embodiments, diagnosis and characterization of kidney disease/function is performed by detection and quantification of specific RNA species from RNA-containing vesicles isolated from patient samples (e.g., urine). In one embodiment, such vesicles are trapped on a filter, thereby allowing RNA extraction from the vesicles. In additional embodiments, centrifugation is used to collect the vesicles. Nucleic acids can be associated with one or more different types of membrane particles (ranging in size from 50-80 nm), exosomes (ranging in size from 50-100 nm), exosome-like vesicles (ranging in size from 20-50 nm), and microvesicles (ranging in size from 100-1000 nm). In several embodiments, these vesicles are isolated and/or concentrated, thereby preserving vesicle associated RNA despite the high RNAse extracellular environment. In several embodiments, the sensitivity of methods disclosed here is improved (vis-à-vis isolation of nucleic acids from tissues and/or collection of naked nucleic acids) based on the use of the vesicle-associated RNA. A variety of methods can be used, according to the embodiments disclosed herein, to efficiently capture and preserve vesicle associated RNA. In several embodiments, centrifugation on a density gradient to fractionate the non-cellular portion of the sample is performed. In some embodiments, density centrifugation is optionally followed by high speed centrifugation to cause vesicle sedimentation or pelleting. As such approaches may be time consuming and may require expensive and specialized equipment in several embodiments, low speed centrifugation can be employed to collect vesicles. In several embodiments, filtration (alone or in combination with centrifugation) is used to capture vesicles of different sizes. In some embodiments, differential capture of vesicles is made based on the surface expression of protein markers. For example, a filter may be designed to be reactive to a specific surface marker (e.g., filter coupled to an antibody) or specific types of vesicles or vesicles of different origin. In some embodiments, the markers are unique vesicle proteins or peptides. In some disease states, the markers may also comprise certain modifications, which, in some embodiments, are used to isolate particular vesicles. Modification may include, but are not limited to addition of lipids, carbohydrates, and other molecules such as acylated, formylated, lipoylated, myristolylated, palmitoylated, alkylated, methylated, isoprenylated, prenylated, amidated, glycosylated, hydroxylated, iodinated, adenylated, phosphorylated, sulfated, and selenoylated, ubiquitinated. In some embodiments, the vesicle markers comprise non-proteins such as lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, RNA, DNA, etc. In several embodiments, the specific capture of vesicles based on their surface markers also enables a “dip stick” format where each different type of vesicle is captured by dipping probes coated with different capture molecules (e.g., antibodies with different specificities) into a patient urine sample. Kidney Structure, Function, and Disease The anatomy of the kidney is divided into two main tissue types, the renal cortex (the superficial area) and the renal medulla (the more interior area). Nephrons, the functional unit of the kidney, span the cortex and medulla. The initial filtering portion of a nephron is the renal corpuscle, located in the cortex, which leads to a renal tubule that passes from the cortex deep into the medulla. A portion of the renal corpuscle, the glomerulus, performs the first step in filtering blood to form urine. The unique anatomy of the kidney leads to a high back-pressure in the glomerulus (due to the glomerulus draining into an arteriole rather than a venule). The back-pressure aids in the filtration process, but also has the potential to lead to kidney damage in certain disease states. Diabetes is characterized by elevated levels of glucose, a relatively large solute, in the blood. When diabetes is uncontrolled, the excess glucose can lead to physical damage to the glomerulus, which is exacerbated over time, as the initial damage to the glomerulus allows increased blood flow speed through the glomerulus, which results in the potential for further glucose-derived damage to the glomerulus. After passing through the glomerulus, filtrate passes through the proximal tubule, the loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting duct. In sum, these anatomical structures function to generate a concentration gradient from the cortex to the medulla, which allows for the reabsorption of water from the filtrate, which creates concentrated urine for excretion. Common clinical conditions involving the kidney include nephritic damage (either to the glomerulus specifically or the kidney generally), renal cysts, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, urinary tract infection, nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), and urinary tract obstruction. Various cancers of the kidney exist, including, but not limited to, renal cell carcinoma, Wilms tumor, and renal cell carcinoma. Several embodiments described herein are advantageous because markers associated with kidney function and/or disease can be rapidly assessed in a high through put protocol. Several embodiments are used to diagnose and/or monitor various kidney diseases (or loss of function related thereto), including, but not limited to chronic kidney disease, acute renal failure, diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, glomerulosclerosis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, minimal change disease, and kidney disease secondary to other diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes (e.g., diabetic nephropathy), collagen diseases, as well as kidney damage caused by pharmaceuticals or other compounds. In several embodiments, damage to the kidney vasculature, in particular the endothelium of renal blood vessels, is detected by evaluation of kidney endothelial cell-specific mRNA. In some embodiments of the invention the markers are related to blood homeostasis such as endothelia cell marker von Willebrand factor (VWF), thrombin, factor VIII, plasmin, and fibrin. Von Willebrand factor is a plasma glycoprotein that is a mediator of platelet adhesion, as such it is released when the endothelium is damaged. VWF is involved in platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. In some embodiments, the markers may be kidney markers, such as, for example, Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP) also known as uromodulin, renin, solute carrier transporters (including, among others, SLC12A1, SLC22A6, SLC22A8, and SLC22A12), uromodulin associated kidney disease marker (UMOD), osteopontin (SPP1), and albumin (ALB), kidney fibrosis markers, such as matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1) and matrix metallopeptidase 3 (MMP3), glomerular markers (e.g., glomerulus-specific (podocine (PDCN)), proximal tubule markers (e.g., proximal tubule-specific (uromodulin (UMOD)), albumin (ALB), Na/K/Cl transporter (SLC12A1)), distal tubule-specific markers (e.g., aquaporin 9 (AQP9)), as kidney-diabetes related markers including but not limited to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1α and β (PPARGC1A and B), nuclear respiratory factor 1 and 2 (NRF1 and 2), estrogen-related receptor α (ESRRA), annexin A5 (ANXA5), protein kinase, AMP-activated, α1 and α□2 catalytic subunit (PRKAA1 and 2), uncoupling protein 1 and 2 (UCP1 and 2), low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 (LRP2), CD24, secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), α2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG), SMAD family member 1 (SMAD1)) and the like. Several embodiments of the methods disclosed herein provide unexpected advantages over existing diagnostic and monitoring methods. For example, some diagnostic tests for kidney disease require a kidney biopsy, which is typically performed via puncture of the organ with a needle. The biopsy technique has the associated risks such as uncontrolled bleeding and infection. The methods described herein provide an opportunity to non-invasively identify RNA which indicates loss of kidney function due to diabetes (or other sources of kidney damage). Several embodiments thus unexpectedly enable remote sampling and assessment of the kidney without the associated increase in patient risk. In addition to directly detecting direct kidney disease or injury, several embodiments of the methods disclosed herein are particularly advantageous because they are used to correlate a loss of kidney function (or symptoms thereof) with other diseases that are not kidney specific, but secondarily impact the kidney, for example, diabetes mellitus. As discussed above, elevate blood glucose levels can lead to kidney damage and eventual reduction in kidney function. In some cases, diabetes mellitus leads to development of or is associated with one or more types of cardiovascular disease, which can further exacerbate kidney damage. In a healthy individual with normal functioning metabolism, insulin is produced by beta cells of the pancreas. The subsequent insulin release enables cells to absorb glucose. In contrast, in a diseased state the cells do not absorb glucose and it accumulates in the blood. This may lead to complications and/or damage to the kidney, as well as complications such as cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and hypertension). Depending on the type of diabetes, a patient with diabetes either does not produce enough insulin or their cells do not properly respond to the insulin that their body does produce. In many cases, pre-diabetic individuals and/or those with diabetes live with early symptoms that are dismissed as being associated with other aspects of their lives or health. For example, post-prandial nausea may be ignored as heartburn, when in fact, the symptom is attributable to elevated blood glucose levels. Ignoring such symptoms over time can lead to, among other symptoms, excessive kidney damage prior to actual diagnosis. In several embodiments, the methods disclosed herein can be implemented in routine physical examinations to detect early markers of kidney damage due to diabetes before the symptoms become so severe that irreversible kidney damage is already sustained. In several embodiments house keeping gene products or constitutively expressed gene products, or markers of basal cellular function are used as markers or controls against which markers of diabetic nephropathy are compared. Housekeeping genes include, but are not limited to, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, β actin (ACTB), and β2 microglobulin (B2M). Other housekeeping genes known in the art are used in other embodiments. In several embodiments the functional status of a patient's kidneys is monitored over time, thereby allowing for the patient's kidney function be quantified at multiple time points. This data allows for tracking of the disease progress which in turn, in several embodiments, enables a medical professional to advise the patient with respect to what additional therapies and/or lifestyle changes might be required of a patient having a kidney disease, such as diabetic nephropathy. In several such embodiments, a first sample of urine is collected from a patient and the level of vesicle or particle associated RNA for a specific gene or genes is determined. A subsequent sample (or samples) is collected from the patient and the level of specific RNA is determined. Any changes in kidney of the patient may thus be determined by comparing the first sample RNA level with the second sample RNA level or by comparing the samples to a control or standard. In some embodiments medication may have been administered to the patient before or after the collection of the first and/or second patient sample. In some embodiments, the medication may be a drug, nutritional supplement, vitamin, immunosuppressant, anti-inflammatory drug, anesthetic or analgesic, stem cell, graft, or kidney transplant. In some embodiments the monitoring may relate to a change in nutrition such as a reduction in caloric intake, or increased hydration, or change in exercise routine, or a change in sleeping pattern of the patient. Methodology Free extracellular RNA is quickly degraded by nucleases, making it a potentially poor diagnostic marker. As described above, some extracellular RNA is associated with particles or vesicles that can be found in urine. This vesicle associated RNA, which includes mRNA, is protected from the degradation processes in the urine. Microvesicles are shed from most cell types and consist of fragments of plasma membrane. Microvesicles contain RNA, mRNA, microRNA, and proteins and mirror the composition of the cell from which they are shed. Exosomes are small microvesicles secreted by a wide range of mammalian cells and are secreted under normal and pathological conditions. These vesicles contain certain proteins and RNA including mRNA and microRNA. Exosomes can also be released into urine by the kidneys and their detection may serve as a diagnostic tool, as described in several embodiments herein. In addition to urine, exosome-like vesicles may also be found in many body fluids such as blood, ascites and amniotic fluid, among others. Several embodiments evaluate nucleic acids such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), tRNA, and small activating RNA (saRNA), among others. In several embodiments the RNA isolated from vesicles from the urine of a patient with diabetic nephropathy is used as a template to make complementary DNA (cDNA). In several embodiments, cDNA is amplified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In other embodiments, amplification of nucleic acid and RNA may also be achieved by any suitable amplification technique such as nucleic acid based amplification (NASBA) or primer-dependent continuous amplification of nucleic acid, or ligase chain reaction. Other methods may also be used to quantify the nucleic acids, such as for example, including Northern blot analysis, RNAse protection assay, PCR, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification, branched-DNA amplification, ELISA, mass spectrometry, CHIP-sequencing, and DNA or RNA microarray analysis. In several embodiments, diabetic nephropathy induces the expression of one or more marker. In several embodiments, the increased expression is measured by the amount of mRNA encoding said markers (in other embodiments, DNA or protein are used to measure expression levels). In some embodiments urine is collected from a patient and directly evaluated. In some embodiments, vesicles are concentrated, for example by use of filtration or centrifugation. Isolated vesicles are then incubated with lysis buffer to release the RNA from the vesicles, the RNA then serving as a template for cDNA which is quantified with methods such as quantitative PCR (or other appropriate amplification or quantification technique). In several embodiments, the level of specific marker RNA from patient vesicles is compared with a desired control such as, for example, RNA levels from a healthy patient population, or the RNA level from an earlier time point from the same patient or a control gene from the same patient. In several embodiments, the disclosed methods allow the detection of the presence or absence of diabetic nephropathy by measuring the levels of mRNA encoding one or more markers related to diabetic nephropathy. In several embodiments, the disclosed methods allow the assessment of the progression (or regression) of diabetic nephropathy by measuring the levels of mRNA encoding one or more markers related to diabetic nephropathy. To determine these mRNA levels, in some embodiments, mRNA-containing vesicles are isolated from plasma using a device for isolating and amplifying mRNA. Embodiments of this device are described in more detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,745,180, 7,939,300, 7,968,288, 7,981,608, 8,076,105, 8,101,344, each of which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. Certain embodiments comprise a multi-well plate that contains a plurality of sample-delivery wells, a vesicle-capturing filter underneath the wells, and an mRNA capture zone underneath the filter which contains immobilized oligo(dT). In certain embodiments, the device also contains a vacuum box adapted to receive the filter plate to create a seal between the plate and the box, such that when vacuum pressure is applied, the urine is drawn from the sample-delivery wells across the vesicle-capturing filter, thereby capturing the vesicles and allowing non-vesicle urine components to be removed by washing the filters. In other embodiments, other means of drawing the urine samples through the sample wells and through across the vesicle-capturing filter, such as centrifugation or positive pressure, are used. In some embodiments, vesicles are captured on a plurality of filter membranes that are layered together. In several embodiments, the captured vesicles are then lysed with a lysis buffer, thereby releasing mRNA from the captured vesicles. The mRNA is then hybridized to the oligo(dT)-immobilized in the mRNA capture zone. Further detail regarding the composition of lysis buffers that may be used in several embodiments can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 8,101,344, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. In several embodiments, cDNA is synthesized from oligo(dT)-immobilized mRNA. In some embodiments, the cDNA is then amplified using real time PCR with primers specifically designed for amplification of disease-associated markers.

In certain embodiments, quantification is calculated by comparing the amount of mRNA encoding a disease marker to a reference value. In some embodiments the reference value will be the amount of mRNA found in healthy non-diseased patients. In other embodiments, the reference value is the expression level of a house-keeping gene. In certain such embodiments, beta-actin, or other appropriate housekeeping gene is used as the reference value. Numerous other house-keeping genes that are well known in the art may also be used as a reference value. In other embodiments, a house keeping gene is used as a correction factor, such that the ultimate comparison is the expression level of marker from a diseased patient as compared to the same marker from a non-diseased (control) sample. In several embodiments, the house keeping gene is a tissue specific gene or marker, such as those discussed above. In still other embodiments, the reference value is zero, such that the quantification of the markers is represented by an absolute number. In several embodiments a ratio comparing the expression of one or more markers from a diseased patient to one or more other markers from a non-diseased person is made. In several other embodiments, expression of markers related to diabetic nephropathy is measured before and/or after administration of a drug (or other therapy) to a patient. In certain such embodiments, the expression profiles may be used to predict the efficacy of a drug compound (e.g. in treating diabetic nephropathy) or to monitor side effects of the drug compound (e.g., impact on kidney function). In some embodiments, the drug monitored may have been administered to treat one or more of chronic kidney disease, acute renal failure, diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, glomerulosclerosis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, minimal change disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, collagen diseases, cancer drug, infections, and/or immunosuppressive diseases. In some embodiments, a drug compound will induce the expression of a distinctive mRNA profile. Likewise, in other embodiments, a drug may inhibit expression of one or more markers. In some such embodiments, the efficacy of drug treatment can be monitored by the disappearance (or reduced expression) of markers associated with a particular disease state. In several embodiments, the methods disclosed herein evaluate a change in diet, lifestyle, or other non-traditional (e.g., non-drug) therapy on the function of a diabetic subject's kidneys. In several embodiments, the analyses described herein are applicable to human patients, while in some embodiments, the methods are applicable to animals (e.g., veterinary diagnoses). EXAMPLES Specific embodiments will be described with reference to the following examples which should be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. Example 1 Identification of Biomarkers Associated with Diabetic Nephropathy For many diabetic patients, early diagnosis of kidney problems followed by appropriate treatment or strict blood glucose control is only way to prevent end-stage kidney disease. As discussed above, however, kidney function tests are relatively limited and often insufficiently sensitive to detect early signs of kidney problems. The invasive nature of kidney precludes its use as routine diagnostic test. Given ready access to potentially large quantities of patient urine samples, several embodiments of the methods disclosed herein employ urine as a diagnostic sample. Many current diagnostic tests measure solutes excreted in urine, or measure urine production rate, in order to evaluate kidney function, or loss thereof. However, several embodiments of the methods disclosed herein exploit the presence of nucleic acid-containing vesicles present in the urine make a sensitive and specific diagnostic analysis of kidney function based on isolation and amplification of kidney specific markers. Methods Samples Urine samples were obtained from healthy donors (n=23) and diabetic nephropathy patients (n=23) at the hospital of University of California San Diego. Exosomal mRNA Analysis. Each urine sample was centrifuged at 1,000×g for 15 minutes, and 10 mL of the resulting supernatant was applied (by vacuum) to a 96-well exosome-capture filterplate. The filterplate was then centrifuged at 2,000×g for an additional 5 minutes. In each well, 60 μL of Lysis buffer containing a cocktail of antisense primers were added, and incubated at 55° C. for 10 minutes. The resultant lysate was transferred from the filterplate to an oligo(dT)-immobilized 96-well microplate by centrifugation at 2,000×g for 5 minutes. cDNA was directly synthesized in the same oligo(dT)-immobilized 96-well microplate by adding dNTPs (final concentration of 5 mM), MMLV reverse transcriptase (final concentration of 2.7 U/mL), and RNasin (final concentration of 0.13 U/mL) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) and incubation at 37° C. for 2 hours. cDNA was subsequently used in real time SYBR green PCR using iTaqSYBR master mix (BioRad, Hercules, Calif.) by established methods (see e.g., Mitsuhashi M, J Immunol Methods. 363:95-100, 2010, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein). PCR conditions were 50 cycles of annealing at 65° C. for 1 minute followed by denaturization at 95° C. for 30 seconds using a PRISM 7900 (Applied Biosystems (ABI), Foster City, Calif.). The results were expressed as the cycle threshold (Ct) using the analytical software (SDS, ABI). Ct=32 was considered as the baseline. Targeting mRNAs A total of 23 mRNAs were quantified, and included: 2 control genes (β-actin (ACTB) and β2 microglobulin (B2M)), glomerulus-specific (podocine (PDCN)), proximal tubules-specific (uromodulin (UMOD), albumin (ALB), and Na/K/Cl transporter (SLC12A1)), distal tubules-specific (aquaporin 9 (AQP9)), as well as kidney-diabetes related miscellaneous mRNAs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1α and β (PPARGC1A and B), nuclear respiratory factor 1 and 2 (NRF1 and 2), estrogen-related receptor α (ESRRA), annexin A5 (ANXA5), protein kinase, AMP-activated, α1 and α2 catalytic subunit (PRKAA1 and 2), uncoupling protein 1 and 2 (UCP1 and 2), low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 (LRP2), CD24, secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), α2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG), and SMAD family member 1 (SMAD1)). Results Expression levels of various exosomal mRNA from either diabetic (DM) or normal (CTL) patients were compared (FIGS. 1A-1H). As shown in FIG. 1A/1B, expression of the control genes (β-actin, ACTB) and B2M did not differ based on presence or absence of diabetes. In contrast, significant increases in expression of PPARGC1A, SMAD1, UMOD, NRF2, SLC12A1 and CD24 were detected in DM patients. These data indicate that these mRNAs (as well as others that are increased in response to diabetes-induced, or other type, of kidney damage) are correlated with the presence of diabetes. Their upregulation indicate their possible utility as biomarkers associated with the disease and its related loss of kidney function. In order to characterize the severity of the diabetic condition in each DM patient, exosome mRNA expression data was correlated with results of HbA1c testing. The HbA1c test evaluates the blood glucose levels in a diabetic patient over time. Clinicians generally view an HbA1c of 5.6% or less is normal. Ranges of 5.7% to 6.4% are associated with pre-diabetes, while levels of 6.5% or higher leads to a diagnosis of diabetes. Above 6.5%, increased HbA1c levels are correlated with increasingly severe dysregulation of blood glucose, and thus increased risk for diabetic nephropathy. As shown in FIGS. 2A-2H, even those DM patients with only a slight increase of HbA1c (6-7%) demonstrated significant increased expression (versus healthy controls) of 5 genes (PPARGC1A, SMAD1, UMOD, NRF2, SLC12A1, not CD24). Given the modest increase in HbA1c levels, these data suggest that these mRNAs are sensitive biomarkers of DM. To further evaluate candidate biomarkers of kidney damage, urine exosome mRNAs were then compared with the levels of serum creatinine. Creatine phosphate is metabolized by the muscles to produce energy and creatinine is produced as a waste product. Creatinine is carried by the blood to the kidneys where it is excreted in the urine. Generally, since creatinine production is linked to muscle mass, which varies little from day to day, so creatinine level should remain relatively constant if kidneys are functioning properly. Increased creatinine levels are indicative of reduced filtration, which is a hallmark of diabetic-induced damage to the nephrons. As shown in FIGS. 3A-3H, DM patients with only a slight increase in serum creatinine (1-2 mg/dL) still showed significant differences in gene expression (against healthy controls) in 4 genes (PPARGC1A, SMAD1, UMOD, SLC12A1). As with the HbA1c data, these results suggest that mRNAs are sensitive biomarkers of kidney damage. Thus, these markers, or others that are elevated in the early stages of kidney damage are used in several embodiments to identify kidney damage at its earliest stages (before other analytical methods would detect severe damage and prior to detectable symptoms). DISCUSSION The data presented above demonstrate that certain mRNA markers can be isolated from patient urine samples, processed, quantified, and correlated to diabetic nephropathy. These data also indicate that certain markers correlated with established diagnostic markers used to identify patients suffering from diabetic nephropathy. As shown in FIG. 1, clear differences in expression levels could be in certain markers when normal subjects were evaluated in comparison to subjects with diabetes. FIGS. 2 and 3 demonstrate that several markers are indicative of the severity of the damaged to the kidney due to diabetes. As shown, the mRNA markers are correlated with traditional diagnostic endpoints. Advantageously, however, the methods disclosed herein are non-invasive (whereas traditional tests require blood draws) can easily and routinely be repeated, and are highly sensitive. This sensitivity, as discussed above, is particularly advantageous as it allows the early detection of diabetic nephropathy, in many cases prior to the ability of a patient or doctor to identify symptoms. As such, in several embodiments, the claimed methods allow preventative action to take place (e.g., lifestyle change, more robust therapy to control the diabetes etc.) and thus prevent disease progression, or at least reduce the severity of the progression. In addition, the high degree of correlation with currently used clinical markers, allows the methods disclosed herein to be used to identify additional genetic markers of diabetic nephropathy, including those that are indicative of the severity of the disease.
