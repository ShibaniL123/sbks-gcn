Step 5: 3-Chloro-2-(5, 8-dichloro-2-methyl-4-oxo-1,6-naphthyridin-1 (4H)-yl)benzonitrile
The mixture of 3-chloro-2-((4-oxo-4-(2,4,5-trichloropyridin-3-yl)but-2-en-2-yl)amino)benzonitrile (0.49 g, 1.22 mmol) and potassium carbonate (0.422 g, 3.05 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) was stirred at 95Â° C. for 1 h. After cooling to rt, the mixture was diluted with water, and the product was extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was washed with water, brine, dried over anhydrous sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified via flash chromatography on silica gel using 0-100% EtOAc/in heptane as eluent to give the title compound (0.31 g, 70%).
