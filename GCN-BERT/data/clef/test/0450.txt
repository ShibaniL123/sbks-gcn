BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a game operating device. More specifically, the present invention relates to a game operating device that analyzes movements of an operating device through detection of a predetermined mark or pattern in an image taken by an imaging device. 2. Description of the Related Arts Some operating devices as related arts of this kind of game operating device are disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3422383 and Japanese Patent Laying-open No. 2002-233665. The related art disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3422383 makes it possible to play a shooting game by arranging light emitters at four locations in such a manner as to surround a video screen, providing a CCD camera to a barrel of a shooting gun to take an image containing the four light emitters, and calculating a designation position in the video screen based on information on image positions of the four light emitters contained in the imaging data at that time. As similar to that of Japanese Patent No. 3422383, the related art of Japanese Patent Laying-open No. 2002-233665 also makes it possible to image a target containing at least four characteristic points in one plane, calculate an attitude parameter of an imaging surface with respect to the plane based on the obtained image data, and make a change to the target based on the parameter. Japanese Patent No. 3422383 implies no specific shape of the input operating means but discloses the use of a “gun”. Additionally, Japanese Patent Laying-open No. 2002-233665 discloses a specific shape of the gun-type controller. In using this gun-type controller for input operations, the direction of designation is to be the direction of the gun barrel. However, the portions corresponding to the barrel and the grip are separately located, and also the directions of the barrel and the grip are different. Thus, it is difficult to recognize intuitively the direction of designation only with a sensation in the hand holding the grip. In this case, moreover, the thumb and the index finger are just placed on the grip, and mainly the middle finger, the ring finger, the small finger and the palm need to hold the gun. However, the barrel significantly extends off the holding portion, which causes a problem where the center of gravity of the entire gun cannot be firmly held and thus it is hard to fix the attitude of the gun. Furthermore, with occurrence of shakes due to trigger operation, it is difficult to operate continuously the gun-type controller at a high speed in a stable manner. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Therefore, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide a novel game operating device. It is another object of the present invention to provide a game operating device that is easy to operate while holding it by one hand and makes it easy to recognize the direction of designation. To solve the above mentioned issues, the present invention employs the structure described below. Besides, the reference numerals, supplementary explanations, etc. in parentheses just show the correspondences with the embodiments described later, for helping the understanding of the present invention, and impose no limitations on the present invention. In one exemplary embodiment, the present invention relates to a game operating device comprising a longitudinal housing, a first operating portion provided on a first plane of the housing along a longitudinal direction at one end in the longitudinal direction, a second operating portion provided on a second plane opposed to the first plane of the housing, a holding portion formed in a direction of the other end along the longitudinal direction of the housing from the second operating portion, and an imaging means provided at the one end of the housing in such a manner that it can perform imaging in a direction along the longitudinal direction. More specifically, and with reference to the drawings, the first operating portion (26, 42: reference numerals indicative of the portions corresponding to those in the embodiment. The same applies to the following reference numerals.) is provided at one end of the first plane (20) of the longitudinal housing (12) in the longitudinal direction (C1), and the second operating portion (42, 28) is provided on the second plane (22) opposed to the first plane. The housing (12) is of shape and dimensions capable of being held by one hand of the game player, the holding portion (18) for holding the housing, i.e. the controller is formed at one end of the housing along the longitudinal direction from the second operating portion. The imaging means (56) is provided at the one end (52) of the housing. Also, the imaging means can perform imaging in the direction along the longitudinal direction of the housing. It is thus possible to recognize or grasp intuitively the direction of designation by the imaging means while holding the housing. In another aspect, the present invention relates to a game operating device comprising a longitudinal housing having a thickness capable of being held by one hand, a first operating portion provided on a first plane of the housing along a longitudinal direction, a second operating portion provided on a second plane opposed to the first plane of the housing at a position reached by an index finger of the one hand when a thumb of the one hand is placed on the first operating portion, a holding portion formed at a position where it can be held by a palm and other fingers of the one hand when a thumb is placed on the first operating portion and an index finger is placed on the second operating portion, and an imaging means provided at an end opposed to the holding portion of the housing in such a manner that it can perform imaging in a direction along a direction in which the thumb is faced when the thumb is placed on the first operating portion and the holding portion is held by the palm and the other fingers. More specifically, relating to this second aspect to the drawings, the first operating portion (26, 42) is provided at one end of the first plane (20) of the longitudinal housing (12) in the longitudinal direction (C1), and the second operating portion (42, 28) is provided on the second plane (22) at the opposite side of the first plane. The housing (12) is of shape and dimensions capable of being held by one hand of the game player, the holding portion (18) for holding the housing is formed on the housing. The holding portion is formed at the position where it can be held by the palm (62P) and the other fingers (62c, 62d, 62e) of the one hand (62), when the thumb (62a) is placed on the first operating portion and the index finger (62b) is placed on the second operating portion. Thus, it is possible to operate the first operating portion and the second operating portion by the thumb and the index finger of one hand while holding the holding portion by that hand. Moreover, the imaging means (56) is provided at the end (52) opposed to the holding portion of the housing. In addition, the imaging means is provided in such a manner that it can perform imaging in the direction along the direction in which the thumb is faced when the thumb is placed on the first operating portion and the holding portion is held by the palm and the other fingers. It is also a feature of the exemplary embodiment that the first operating portion (26, 42) and the second operating portion (42, 28) are arranged on the first plane and the second plane of the housing, with correspondence in position between the two. Therefore, the housing is supported by the index finger on the second plane in operating the first operating portion on the first plane, and the housing is supported by the thumb on the first plane in operating the second operating portion on the second plane, which makes the operations more stable. In addition, it is possible to change the direction of designation of the imaging means (56) while holding the housing between the thumb and the index finger, which allows the direction of designation of the imaging means to be recognized or grasped more easily. It is also a feature of the exemplary embodiment that the imaging means (56) is provided in the vicinity of the first operating portion (26; 42) and the second operating portion (42; 28), which makes it easier to recognize the direction of designation of the imaging means. It is also a feature of the exemplary embodiment that the concave portion (34) is formed in the second plane of the housing (12), for example, and the second operating portion (42; 28) is arranged in the concave portion. Accordingly, it is possible to place the index finger in the concave portion, which makes it possible to operate the second operating portion in a quick and reliable manner. It is also a feature of the exemplary embodiment that the concave portion (34) includes the first inclined surface (38) extending in the direction of the holding portion (18) and the second inclined surface (40) in the opposite direction. As a consequence, the second operating portion can be operated quickly and reliably just by bending the index finger in the concave portion toward the holding portion. It is also a feature of the exemplary embodiment that the angle of inclination of the first inclined surface (38) is set so as to be smaller than the angle of inclination of the second inclined surface (40). This brings about the advantages that the housing is easy to hold by both hands and the index finger can be reliably taken off the second operating portion. It is also a feature of the exemplary embodiment that the concave portion (34) includes the valley (36), for example, and the bottom of the valley forms a plane approximately parallel to the first plane. Meanwhile, the holding portion (18) is provided rearward of the housing. Accordingly, the inclined surface (38) is formed linking the bottom of the valley and the holding portion, and the second operating portion (26) is placed on the inclined surface. Thus, the second operating portion can be naturally operated when the index finger is bent. It is also a feature of the exemplary embodiment that the vibrator (80) is arranged on the side opposed to the imaging means (56) in the longitudinal direction of the housing (12), which decreases a possibility that the vibrations from the vibrator affect adversely imaging operation by the imaging information arithmetic unit. That is, a distance becomes long between the vibrator and the imaging information arithmetic unit, thereby preventing an imaging element of the imaging information arithmetic unit from being blurred as much as possible. It is also a feature of the exemplary embodiment that the battery (78) as a relatively heavy matter is stored within a range of the holding portion (18) of the housing (12), and thus a center of gravity G (FIG. 2 (B)) is reliably contained within the range of the holding portion. This makes it possible to change stably the direction of designation of the imaging means while holding the holding portion 18. According to the present invention, it is easy to operate the first operating portion and the second operating portion while holding the controller by one hand, which makes it possible to obtain a novel game operating device that is high in flexibility and capable of being operated only by one hand. Additionally, the imaging range of the imaging means contains the direction along the longitudinal direction of the holding portion, which makes it possible to recognize or grasp intuitively the direction of designation of the imaging means while holding the housing. The above described objects and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS A controller 10 of one embodiment of the present invention shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 includes a longitudinal housing 12 molded of plastic or metal, for example. The housing 12 has a required depth and includes a lower housing 14 having a shape of a flat rectangle with a top-surface opening and an bottom, an upper housing 16 assembled integrally with the lower housing 14 in such a manner as to close up the top-surface opening of the lower housing 14, and in particular, has a cross-section rectangle on the whole as shown in FIG. 2 (A) and FIG. 2 (E). The housing 12 has a holding portion 18 and is of size capable of being held by one hand of an adult or child on the whole. Its length L (FIG. 2 (D)) in a longitudinal direction (a direction along a longitudinal center line or axis C1 shown in FIG. 2 (B)) is set at 8 to 15 cm, for example, and its width (orthogonal to the longitudinal direction C1) W (FIG. 2 (D)) is set at 2 to 4 cm, for example, respectively. Alternatively, the shape of the housing 12 is not limited to a longitudinal shape with a plane rectangle and may be a longitudinal shape with a plane oval or the like. Likewise, its cross-section shape is not limited to a rectangle and may be a circle or other polygons. A flat main surface of the upper housing 16 constitutes an upper surface 20 of the housing 12. As can be seen well from FIG. 1 (A) and FIG. 2 (B) in particular, the upper surface 20 of the housing 12 is a rectangle extending along the longitudinal direction of the housing 12. Also, the upper surface 20 is equivalent to a first plane, and a surface or main surface 22 of the lower housing 18 is equivalent to a second plane opposed to the first plane 20. The second plane 22 is approximately parallel with the first plane 20. Besides, an upward direction is assumed to be forward (side of one end) and a downward direction is assumed to be backward (side of the other end) in the longitudinal direction C1 of the housing 12. A power switch 24 is provided on the upper surface 20 of the housing 12, on the slightly right side of the center in a width direction of the upper surface 20 (indicated by the transverse center line or axis C1 in FIG. 2 (B)) in the vicinity of the housing front end (one end). The power switch 24 is intended to turn on or off an electric power source to a game machine 112 (FIG. 9) by a remote operation. Besides, in this embodiment, a power switch for turning on or off the controller 10 itself is not provided. The controller 10 is turned on by operating any one of the operating switches of the controller 10, and is automatically turned off if no operation is performed for a predetermined period of time or more. A direction switch 26 is provided on the width-direction center line C1 of the upper surface 20, forward of the longitudinal-direction center of the housing 12 (indicated by a center line C2 in FIG. 2 (B)). The direction switch 26 is a combined switch of four-direction push switches and center switch, and includes operating portions 26F, 26B, 26R and 26L for four directions indicated by arrows, forward (or up), backward (or down), right and left, and also includes a center switch 28. The operating portions 26F, 26B, 26R and 26L are arranged on a single key top, in a shape of a ring with a turn of 90 degrees among them. By operating any one of them, one of contacts (not shown) which are arranged in a shape of a polygon corresponding individually to these operating portions 26F, 26B, 26R and 26L is selectively turned on, thereby selecting any one of the directions of upward, downward, right and left. For example, by operating any one of the operating portions 26F, 26B, 26R and 26L, one of those contacts is turned on to make it possible to designate a movement direction of a character or object (player character or player object) capable of being operated by a game player or to designate a movement direction of a cursor. The center switch 28 is a single push-button switch and may be used as a so-called B button. As is well known, the B button 28 can be used for changing the game mode selected by means of a select switch 32 described later, canceling the action decided by means of an A button described later, and so on. Besides, as is well known, such a combined switch as described in relation to the embodiment is highly utilized for cellular telephones and the like (see http://www.jpo.go.jp/shiryou/s_sonota/hyoujun_gijutsu/small_switch/b-6-2.htm, for example), and thus a more detailed description of it is omitted. As stated above, the direction switch 26 of the embodiment includes the contacts (not shown) arranged in the shape of a polygon (rectangle or rhombus) as to indicate individual directions (the four directions in the embodiment) so that these contacts are operated by means of the operating portions 26F, 26B, 26R and 26L formed on a single key top. Alternatively, the operating portions 26F, 26B, 26R and 26L may be provided as individual key tops so that one contact is operated by means of each corresponding key top. In addition, the direction switch 26 may be a cross key or a joystick. In the case of the direction switch 26 as a joystick, an arbitrary direction and position can be designated by turning its tip end 360 degrees in an arbitrary direction or deflecting the same. As can be seen well from FIG. 2 (B), a start switch 30 and a select switch 32 having key tops arranged in a shape of the Japanese KATAKANA character “” with the width-direction center line C1 of the housing 12 between them are provided on the upper surface 20, backward of the direction switch 26. The start switch 30 is used for starting (re-starting) and pausing a game and the like. The select switch 32 is used for selecting a game mode, etc. Additionally, the start switch 30 and the select switch 32 may be provided in an arbitrary layout such as one transverse line and one vertical line, not limited to the shape of the Japanese KATAKANA character “” presented in relation to the embodiment. A concave portion 34 is formed on the second plane 22 of the lower housing 14, at a position approximately corresponding to the position of the direction switch 26. The concave portion 34 is a concave formed so as to reach from one end of the other of the second plane 22 in a width direction, as can be understood from FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 (C). Additionally, strictly speaking, the concave portion 34 of this embodiment is formed slightly forward of the direction switch 26, as can be seen from a contrast between FIG. 2 (B) and FIG. 2 (C). The concave portion 34 is formed at a position where, when the player holds the controller 10, i.e., the holding portion 18 of the housing 12 by one hand as described later, the index finger of the same hand naturally falls. Therefore, a width of a valley 36 of the concave portion 34 (in the longitudinal direction of the housing 12) is formed in a size that allows the index finger to come into there. The concave portion 34 has two inclined surfaces 38 and 40 rising from the valley 36. The former inclined surface 38 is formed with a rise from the valley 36 toward the rear of the housing 12, and conversely, the latter inclined surface 40 is rising from the valley 36 toward the front of the housing 12. An A button 42 is provided on the inclined surface 38 on the rear side of the concave portion 34 of the lower housing 14. The A button 42 is provided at a position corresponding to the direction switch 26. Here, the corresponding position means a position where the direction switch 26 and the A button 42 are arranged close to each other as viewed through from the upper surface of housing 12, and more preferably, the direction switch 26 and the A button 42 are arranged in such a manner as to be at least partially overlapped. As can be seen well from the illustration, the bottom of the valley 36 is on a plane approximately parallel with the upper surface 20, i.e., the first plane of the housing 12, and the rear inclined surface 38 on which the A button 42 is arranged is formed between the bottom parallel surface of the valley 36 and the holding portion 18 formed on the rear (other) side of the housing 12 described earlier. Also, the A button 42 is a push switch having a switch contact (not shown) and a key top for turning on or off the switch contact, and the key top is provided so as to move in a direction perpendicular to the inclined surface 38. Therefore, as described later, the player can turn on the A button 42 just by putting his/her index finger or middle finger in the concave portion 34 and pulling it toward him/her. That is, the index finger or the middle finger can be positioned in the concave portion 34, which makes it possible to operate the A button 42 quickly and reliably when needed. Besides, the A button 42 allows a player character or a player object to perform an arbitrary action such as punching, throwing, capturing (obtaining), riding and jumping. For example, in an action game, the A button 42 makes it possible to designate jumping, punching and manipulating a weapon, etc. Also, in a role-playing game (RPG) or simulation RPG, the A button 42 makes it possible to designate the obtainment of an item, the selection and decision of a weapon and a command, and so on. In addition, the above stated holding portion 18 is formed on the housing, backward of the concave portion 34, i.e., the A button 42. As described later, in using the controller 10, the controller 10, i.e., the housing 12 is held in such a manner that the player's palm of one hand wraps the holding portion 18. At that time, the player can hold stably the holding portion 18 only by one hand because the controller 10, i.e., the housing 12 is of a size or thickness capable of being held by one hand. Moreover, the key top of the A button 42 is turned on by pushing it in the direction perpendicular to the inclined surface 38, that is, the direction toward the holding portion 18. The inclined part 38 is not perpendicular to the upper surface of the housing 12, that is, the first plane 20 and, in the end, the key top of the A button 42 is pushed in a direction not perpendicular to the upper surface 20. On the contrary, the B button 28 and the direction switch 26 are turned on by pushing them in the direction perpendicular to the upper surface 20 of the upper housing 16. These push directions mean directions in which the index finger and the thumb can apply pressure naturally in holding the holding portion 18. This makes it possible to support a periphery of the operating portion continuously by the thumb and the index finger during the operation while holding the holding portion 18, and perform the operation in the stable holding state at any time. Furthermore, an X button 44 and a Y button 46 are arranged on the width-direction center line C1 and backward of the longitudinal-direction center C2 of the housing 12, in a straight line with a spacing between the two. These X button 44 and Y button 46 are used to make adjustments to view point position and view point direction in displaying a three-dimension game image, that is, make adjustments to a position and a field angle of a virtual camera. A battery cover 48 is detachably attached to the lower housing 14 forming the holding portion 18, and a battery 78 shown in FIG. 7 is stored inside the battery cover 48. Thus, the controller 10 operates with the battery 78 as a power source. In addition, the battery cover 48 can be detached by removing an engagement pawl 50 from the lower housing 14. As stated above, the battery 78 as a relatively heavy matter is stored within a range of the holding portion 18 of the housing 12, and thus a center of gravity G (FIG. 2 (B)) is reliably contained within the range of the holding portion 18. This makes it possible to perform stably the displacement or movement of the controller 10 while holding the holding portion 18. An infrared imaging device 56 forming one part of an imaging information arithmetic unit 54 described later in detail is arranged on a front-end surface 52 (FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 (A)) of the housing 12, and a 32-pin edge connector 60 is provided on a rear-end surface 58 (FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 (E)) of the housing 12, for example. The connector 58 is used to attach and connect the controller of this embodiment (the first controller) 10 to another second controller (described later), and so on. The controller 10 structured in such a manner can be held by one hand of the game player (not shown). FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 show a state in which the player holds the controller 10 by his/her hand. Referring to these drawings, a player's palm 62P and balls of middle finger 62c, ring finger 62d and small finger 62e of one hand 62 (right hand in the drawings) hold the holding portion 18 of the housing 12 in such a manner as to wrap the holding portion 18 lightly. In the state, a thumb 62a of the hand 62 is positioned on the direction switch 26 and an index finger 62b is positioned in the valley 36 of concave portion 34 of the lower housing 14. More specifically, the direction switch 26 is arranged at a position reached by the thumb 62a of the hand 62 holding the housing 12, that is, at a position capable of being operated by the thumb 62a. The A button 42 is arranged at a position reached by the index finger 62b of the hand 62 holding the housing 12, that is, at a position capable of being operated by the index finger 62b. Accordingly, the player can operate the direction switch 26 by the thumb 62a and operate the A button 42 by the index finger 62b while holding the housing 12 by the hand 62. More specifically, the index finger 62b of the hand 62 is positioned in such a manner as to make contact with a surface of the valley 36 of the above stated concave portion 34 formed in the lower housing 14. By bending the index finger 62b toward him/her (rightward in FIG. 3) in that state, the user can push the key top of the A button 42 by the ball of the index finger 62b in a direction perpendicular to the near-side inclined surface 38 of the concave portion 34. Consequently, the player can operate the A button 42 by the index finger 62b while holding the housing 12 by the hand 62. Besides, the same applies if the holding hand 62 is a left hand. In addition, the A button 42 is described above as being operated by the index finger 62b. Alternatively, by further providing an A2 button (not shown) of the same shape as the A button backward of the A button 42, the housing 12 may be held by the palm 62P and the balls of the ring finger 62d and small finger 62e so that the A button 42 can be operated by the index finger 62b and the A2 button 32 by the middle finger 62c, respectively. As stated above, the controller 10 of this embodiment, under the state of being held by one hand, allows the first operating portion (the direction switch 26 in the embodiment) and the second operating portion (the A button 42 in the embodiment) to be easily operated. That is, the controller 10 of this embodiment makes it possible to operate each of the operating portions with stability while holding the controller 10 by one hand. Therefore, the player can use the other hand for playing a game or for another purpose. Moreover, since it can be held only by one hand, the controller 10 can be handled more freely as compared with the case of holding by the both hands. As a consequence, it is possible to perform smoothly the carrying, movement or displacement of the controller 10. Additionally, in the controller 10 of this embodiment, the position of the first operating portion, for example, the direction switch 26 provided on the upper surface 20 of the housing 12 and the position of the second operating portion, e.g., the A button 42 provided on the lower surface of the housing 12 correspond to each other on the upper and lower surfaces 20 and 22 of the housing 12 so that the housing 12 can be caught by the thumb and the index finger (or middle finger) operating these portions, resulting in further stable operations. For example, when the direction switch 26 is operated by the thumb 62a, the housing 12 is supported from underneath by the index finger 62b or the middle finger 62c positioned in the concave portion 34 for operating the A button 42, which makes it possible to push the direction switch 26 by the thumb 62a in a stable manner. Likewise, when the A button 42 is operated by the index finger 62b or the middle finger 62c, the housing 12 is supported from above by the thumb 62a for operating the direction switch 26, which make it possible to push the A button 42 by the index finger 62b or the middle finger 62c with stability. Furthermore, in this embodiment, the center of gravity G of the controller 10 falls a cross point of the width-direction center line C1 and the longitudinal-direction center line C2 shown in FIG. 2 (B) or a vicinity thereto. The position of the center of gravity G is contained in a range of the holding portion 18, as can be seen well from FIG. 2. Therefore, when the controller 10 is held at the holding portion 18, the holding hand 62 (FIG. 6) supports the position of the center of gravity G, which allows the holding state to be maintained with greatly high stability. Thus, it is possible to perform further smoothly the movement, carrying or displacement of the controller 10 for the imaging information arithmetic unit. FIG. 3 shows a state that the index finger 62b presses the A button 42. When it is not necessary to press the A button 42, the index finger 62b may be moved off the A button 42 (the same applies to the middle finger 62c). That is, as shown in FIG. 5, by pushing the index finger 62b (or the middle finger 62c) against the front-end inclined surface 40 of the concave portion 34, it is possible to make the housing stable in the state that the A button 42 is released from the index finger 62b (the middle finger 62c). Consequently, it is not necessary to change the state of holding the housing 12 (change a holding manner), depending on whether to press the A button 42 or not. FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 illustrate the state that the upper housing 16 is removed from the controller 10 and the state that the lower housing 14 is removed from the controller 10, respectively. As shown in FIG. 6 indicating the removal of the upper housing 16, a substrate 64 is attached to an upper end of the lower housing 14 in such a manner as to seal the upper opening of the lower housing 14. The above described power switch 24, direction switch 26, start switch 30, select switch 32, X button 44 and Y button 46 are mounted on an upper main surface of the substrate 64, and they are connected to a processor 66 (FIG. 8) constituting a controller circuit by means of appropriate wiring (not shown). Moreover, an acceleration sensor 68 and a wireless module 70 are assembled on the upper main surface of the substrate 64, between the direction switch 26 and the X button 44, for example, between the start switch 30 and the select switch 32. The acceleration sensor 68 is preferably a three-axis linear accelerometer that detects linear acceleration along each of an X axis, Y axis and Z axis. Alternatively, a two-axis linear accelerometer that only detects linear acceleration along each of an X axis and Y axis (or other pair of axes) may be used in another embodiment depending on the type of control signals desired. As a non-limiting example, the three-axis or two-axis linear accelerometer 68 may be of the type available from Analog Devices, Inc. or STMicroelectronics N.V. Preferably, the acceleration sensor 68 is an electrostatic capacitance or capacitance-coupling type that is based on silicon micro-machined MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) technology. However, any other suitable accelerometer technology (e.g., piezoelectric type or piezoresistance type) now existing or later developed may be used to provide the three-axis or two-axis acceleration sensor 68. As one skilled in the art understands, a linear accelerometer, such as acceleration sensor 68, is only capable of detecting acceleration along a straight line corresponding to each axis of the acceleration sensor. In other words, the direct output of the acceleration sensor 68 is limited to signals indicative of linear acceleration (static or dynamic) along each of the two or three axes thereof. As a result, the acceleration sensor 68 cannot directly detect movement along a non-linear (e.g. arcuate) path, rotation, rotational movement, angular displacement, tilt, position, attitude or any other physical characteristic. However, through additional processing of the linear acceleration signals output from the acceleration sensor 68, additional information relating to the housing 12 can be inferred or calculated, as one skilled in the art will readily understand from the description herein. For example, by detecting static linear acceleration (i.e., gravity), the linear acceleration output of the acceleration sensor 68 can be used to infer tilt of the object relative to the gravity vector by correlating tilt angles with detected linear acceleration. In this way, the acceleration sensor 68 can be used in combination with the processor 66 (or another processor) to determine tilt, attitude or position of the housing 12. Similarly, various movements and/or positions of the housing 12 can be calculated or inferred through processing of the linear acceleration signals generated by the acceleration sensor 68 when the housing 12 containing the acceleration sensor 68 is subjected to dynamic accelerations by, for example, the hand of a user. In another embodiment, the acceleration sensor 68 may include an embedded signal processor or other type of dedicated processor for performing any desired processing of the acceleration signals output from the accelerometers therein prior to outputting signals to processor 66. For example, the embedded or dedicated processor could be used to convert the detected acceleration signal to a corresponding tilt angle when the acceleration sensor is intended to detect static acceleration (i.e., gravity). In this embodiment, the acceleration sensor 68 and processor 66 function as a position and/or attitude determining means for determining the position and/or attitude of the controller 10 held by the player with his/her hand. By outputting information on the position and/or attitude through conversion of the acceleration signal output from the acceleration sensor 68, in addition to operation signals from the direction switch 26, the A button 42, etc. and obtaining operation signals for position or attitude at the game machine side, it is possible to perform game operations with a high degree of flexibility. As stated above, by arranging the acceleration sensor 68 within the housing 12 so that the acceleration detected by acceleration sensor 68 can be used to determine the attitude and position of the housing 12, i.e. the controller 10, the player can easily change the position and attitude of the controller 10 by moving (turning) the wrist of his/her hand while holding the holding portion 18 of the housing 12 by that hand described above with reference to FIG. 3 to FIG. 5. Therefore, according to the controller 10 of this embodiment, it is possible to utilize not only operation signals from the operating switches 24 to 32, 44 and 46 of the controller 10 but also the position and attitude of the controller 10 as controller data, allowing further higher degrees of operations. Moreover, the acceleration sensor 68 is provided within the housing 12 of the holding portion 18, and in the course of nature, the thumb is placed on the direction switch 26 and the index finger is placed on the A button 42, and the remaining fingers support the holding portion. Thus, no variations occur among individuals in the way to hold the controller 10, which makes it possible to perform high-precision detection without variations under predetermined criteria. That is, the above mentioned turning operation of the wrist may result in a displacement of a rotational axis due to its rotation. Also, since right-handed rotation and left-handed rotation are asymmetrical, there is a possibility of causing an error. However, by providing the acceleration sensor 68 within the housing 12 of the holding portion 18 as in this embodiment, the displacement of the rotation axis due to its rotation is reduced with a decreased possibility of detection errors. Additionally, in the embodiment, the acceleration sensor 68 is set up within a range of the holding portion 18 of the housing 12 (FIG. 1). This brings about an advantage that the position and/or attitude determining means can determine the position and/or the attitude with high accuracy. Besides, the position and/or attitude determining means may be arranged at another position within the housing 12 according to the purpose. For example, as the position and/or attitude determining means is moved backward of the housing 12, the amount of change in position and/or attitude due to the displacement of the housing 12 becomes smaller. On the contrary, as the means is moved forward of the housing 12, the amount of change in position and/or attitude due to the displacement of the housing 12 becomes larger. Consequently, the position and/or attitude determining means may be arranged at the most appropriate position according to required performance. In another exemplary embodiment, the acceleration sensor 68 may be replaced with a gyro-sensor of any suitable technology incorporating, for example, a rotating or vibrating element. Exemplary MEMS gyro-sensors that may be used in this embodiment are available from Analog Devices, Inc. Unlike the linear acceleration sensor 68, a gyro-sensor is capable of directly detecting rotation (or angular rate) around an axis defined by the gyroscopic element (or elements) therein. Thus, due to the fundamental differences between a gyro-sensor and an linear acceleration sensor, corresponding changes need to be made to the processing operations that are performed on the output signals from these devices depending on which device is selected for a particular application. Due to the fact that the nature of gyroscopes is known to one skilled in the art, as well as the fundamental differences between linear accelerometers and gyroscopes, further details are not provided herein so as not to obscure the remainder of the disclosure. While gyro-sensors provide certain advantages due to their ability to directly detect rotational movement, linear acceleration sensors are generally more cost effective when used in connection with the controller applications described herein. An antenna pattern 72 is formed on the upper main surface of the substrate 64, and the controller 10 is provided as a wireless controller by the means of the antenna pattern 72 and the above mentioned wireless module 70. More specifically, the operation signals from the above stated individual switches and buttons 24 to 32, 44 and 46, and the detection data (detection signal) from the imaging information arithmetic unit 54 and acceleration data (acceleration signal) from the acceleration sensor 68 are modulated in the wireless module 70 to weak radio wave signals, and the modulated weak radio wave signals are emitted from the antenna pattern 72. Accordingly, the game machine (not shown), by receiving the weak radio waves and performing demodulation and decoding on them, can obtain the operation signals from the above stated individual switches and buttons 24 to 32, 44 and 46, and the detection data from the imaging information arithmetic unit 54 and the detected acceleration data from the acceleration sensor 68. Then, the game machine makes the game progress, based on the signals, data and game programs obtained in such a manner. In addition, a crystal oscillator 74 provided on the upper main surface of the substrate 64 is intended to generate a basic clock of a computer or processor 66 (FIG. 8) contained in the controller 10. As shown in FIG. 7 in which the lower housing 14 is removed, the imaging information arithmetic unit 54 is attached to an edge of the front end on the lower main surface of the substrate 64, and the connector 60 is attached to an edge of the rear end thereof. The imaging information arithmetic unit 54 has the above mentioned infrared imaging device 56 and an image processing circuit 76 for processing image data imaged by the imaging device (imaging means) 56. Additionally, the above described A button 42 is attached to the lower main surface of the substrate 64 backward of the imaging information arithmetic unit 54, and the aforesaid battery 78 is stored further backward thereof. A vibrator 80 is attached to the lower main surface of the substrate 64, between the battery 78 and the connector 60. The vibrator 80 may be a vibrating motor or solenoid, for example. The vibrator 80 creates vibrations in the controller 10, and the vibrations are transmitted to the player's hand 62 (FIG. 3) holding it, which realizes a vibration-ready game. Consequently, it is possible to provide the player with a vibratory stimulus. Besides, as stated above, arranging the vibrator 80 on the opposite side of the imaging information arithmetic unit 54 in the longitudinal direction of the housing 12 would decrease the possibility that the vibrations from the vibrator 80 affect adversely imaging by the imaging information arithmetic unit 54. That is, a longest distance can be secured between the vibrator 80 and the imaging information arithmetic unit 54, which makes it possible to prevent the imaging element of the imaging information arithmetic unit 54 from being blurred as much as possible. Besides, in changing the direction of imaging with the imaging means or imaging device 56, the player may hold the holding portion 18 of the housing 12 by one hand and move the wrist of the hand in that state, as already described with reference to FIG. 3 to FIG. 5. At that time, the imaging means 56 is provided at the front end of the housing 12, the thumb is placed on the direction switch 26 and the index finger is placed on the A button 42 in the course of nature, and the remaining fingers support the holding portion. This makes it possible to perform an imaging operation under predetermined uniform criteria, independent of variations among individuals in the way to hold the controller 10. Here, referring to FIG. 8, a description is given as to electric circuit structure of the controller 10 of the embodiment. The imaging information arithmetic unit 54 has the infrared imaging device 56 and the aforesaid image processing circuit 76 for processing image data imaged by the imaging device 56. As illustrated, the imaging device 56 includes a solid imaging element 561 such as a CMOS sensor and a CCD. An infrared filter (a filter permeable to infrared rays only) 562 and a lens 563 are arranged frontward of the imaging element 561. Accordingly, the imaging device 56 generates image data through detection of infrared rays alone. In addition, the image processing circuit 76 processes the infrared image data obtained from the imaging device 56, senses a high-intensity portion, detects the portion's center-of-gravity position and area, and outputs the data on them. The data on the position and area of the high-intensity portion is input from the image processing circuit 76 to the processor 66. Moreover, the operation signals from the aforementioned switches and buttons 24 to 32, 4 and 46 are input into the processor 66. In addition, the three-axis or two-axis acceleration data (acceleration signal) from the acceleration sensor 68 is also input into the processor 66. Based on the operation signals from the operating switches 24 to 32, 44 and 46, the processor 66 detects which one of the operating switches and operating buttons is being operated from time to time. The operation data is output as a sequence of controller data together with the acceleration data and the high-intensity portion data, and is input into the wireless module 70. The wireless module 70 modulates a carrier wave of predetermined frequency with the controller data, and emits the weak radio wave signal from the antenna 72. Besides, the signals and data input through the connector 60 provided at the rear end of the controller 10 are also input into the processor 66, and processed by the processor 66 as with the aforementioned signals and data, provided as controller data to the wireless module 70, and then output as a weak radio wave signal from the controller 10 in the same manner. Additionally, the processor 66 may be independent from the wireless module 70, and, in using a wireless module based on Bluetooth (registered trademark) standard, etc., it may be contained as a microcomputer in the module. In order to play a game using the controller 10 in a game system 100, a player 102 holds the controller 10 (the housing thereof) by one hand 62, as shown in FIG. 9. Then, the player 102 faces the imaging device 56 (FIG. 8) of the aforementioned imaging information arithmetic unit 54 at the front end of the controller 10 toward a screen 106 of a display 104. At that time, two LED modules 108A and 108B are set up in a vicinity of the screen 106 of the display 104. Each of the LED modules 108A and 108B outputs infrared rays. Meanwhile, the infrared filter 562 (FIG. 8) is incorporated into the imaging information arithmetic unit 54 of the controller 10 held by the player, as described above. The image processing circuit 76 (FIG. 8) of the imaging information arithmetic unit 54 obtains information on the positions and areas of the LED modules 108A and 108B as high-intensity point information, by processing the taken image containing the infrared rays. Data on the positions and magnitudes of the intensity points is transmitted from the controller 10 to a game machine 112 by radio (weak radio waves), and received by the game machine 112. When the player moves the controller 10, i.e. the imaging information arithmetic unit 54, the data on the intensity point positions and magnitudes is changed. By taking advantage of this, the game machine 112 can obtain an operation signal corresponding to the movement of the controller and make the game progress according to that. In this manner, the imaging information arithmetic unit 54 can image a marker (an infrared light from the LED in the embodiment) and obtain an operation signal according to a change in the position of the marker in the taken image. This allows coordinate direct input and rotational input to the screen, unlike operations with the operating switches, operating keys or operating buttons which are manipulated with fingers. However, the principle of the imaging information arithmetic unit is well known as described in Japanese Patent No. 3422383, and thus a more detailed explanation on it is omitted here. Besides, motion tracking means an analysis of the movement of an object or camera (the controller 10 here) with a specific mark or pattern as a target in the screen (image). FIG. 10 is a schematic view of the controller 10 illustrated in detail in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, for example. As depicted in FIG. 10, the holding portion 18 is set up near a one end of the longitudinal direction of the housing 12 of the controller 10, that is, a one end of the direction along the width-direction center line C1, and the imaging device 56 is installed at the other end of the housing 12, on the center line C1 and on the opposite side of the holding portion 18. Accordingly, as shown in FIG. 3, a straight line (the width-direction center line C1) passing through the palm 62P of the hand 62 holding the holding portion 18 is in alignment with the direction of designation by the imaging device 56, which brings about an advantage that it is easy to recognize the direction in which the imaging device 56 is faced. More specifically, since the direction of imaging by the imaging device 56 (corresponding to a direction in which a viewing angle C described later is faced) is in parallel with the longitudinal direction of the housing 12, it is possible to grasp the direction of designation by the imaging device 56 through intuition while holding the housing 12. Here, the longitudinal direction of the housing 12, in the case of a rectangular housing as with the embodiment, is represented by the width-direction center line C1, for example. In addition, when the thumb is placed in the center of the direction switch 26, for example, and the holding portion 18 is held by the palm and the other fingers as shown in FIG. 29 described later, the direction of imaging by the imaging device 56 denotes a direction in which the thumb is faced. Besides, the LED modules 108A and 108B shown in FIG. 9 and the imaging information arithmetic unit 54 of the controller 10 have viewing angles A, B and C, respectively. In the embodiment, the viewing angles A and B are equal to each other and they are 34° (half-value angle), for example, and the viewing angle C is 41°, for example. Additionally, in tracking operation, when the two LED modules 108A and 108B exist within the viewing angle C of the imaging device 56 as shown in FIG. 10, the imaging information arithmetic unit 54 detects the movements of the imaging information arithmetic unit 54, i.e. the controller 10, by using the information on the positions and magnitudes of high-intensity points from the two LED modules 108A and 108B. However, when only one LED module 108A or 108B exists within the viewing angle C of the imaging device 56 as shown in FIG. 11, the imaging information arithmetic unit 54 detects the movement of the controller 10 by using the information on the position and magnitude of high-intensity point from only one of the two LED modules 108A and 108B. The above described controller 10 sufficiently carries out the functions as a game operating device by itself. Furthermore, as in an embodiment described below, it is possible to make the controller 10 cooperate with another controller (or an adapter). In the embodiment represented in FIG. 13 to FIG. 17, a second controller 200 shown in FIG. 13 and the first controller 10 of the embodiment described earlier are employed. More specifically, the second controller 200 includes a transverse housing 202, unlike the longitudinal housing 12 of the first controller 10. Left and right sides of the transverse housing 202 function as holding portions 204 and 206, respectively. The holding portion 204 is wrapped and held by the palm of the left hand 63, and the holding portion 206 is wrapped and held by the palm of the right hand 62, as illustrated in FIG. 16. That is, the holding portion 204 is a left-hand holding portion and the holding portion 206 is a right-hand holding portion. The same thing applies to a different embodiment of FIG. 18 to FIG. 20. In addition, a surface of the holding portion 204 and a surface of the holding portion 206 are located in the same plane, and form together an upper surface 203 of the housing 202 shown in FIG. 14 and FIG. 15. A receiving portion 208 is formed between the left-hand holding portion 204 and right-hand holding portion 205 of the housing 202. The receiving portion 208 is a concave portion for accepting the housing 12 of the first controller 10. The receiving portion 208 has a shape with opened front surface and upper surface, and its inner shape is similar to the outer shape of the housing 12 (FIG. 2 (E)) in a direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction of the first controller 10, and is slightly larger in dimensions than the same. More specifically, a width Wa of the receiving portion 208 is equal to or slightly larger than the width W of the housing 12 of the first controller 10 shown in FIG. 2 (D), and a depth D1 of the same is almost equal to the thickness T of the housing 12 (FIGS. 2 (A) and (E)). However, a length D2 of depth of the same is set in correspondence with the length of the holding portion 18 of the housing 12 of the first controller 10 clearly illustrated in FIG. 1, for example. That is, the depth D2 of the receiving portion 208 is equal to or slightly longer than or slightly shorter than the length of the holding portion 18 of the first controller 10 (in the longitudinal direction of the first controller). Additionally, although not illustrated with precision, a connector 210 to be connected with the connector 56 provided to the first controller 10 is arranged in a back of the receiving portion 208. Since the connector 56 of the first controller 10 is a male connector, the connector 210 of the second controller 200 is a female connector. A well-known analog joystick 212 and direction switch (digital joystick) 214 are arranged on the upper surface of the left-hand holding portion 204 of the housing 202 of the second controller 200. Also, an A button 216 and B button 218 are provided on the upper surface of the right-hand holding portion 206, and an X button 220 and Y button 222 are provided so as to surround the slightly larger A button 216. Moreover, a joystick 224 is provided for changing a position, i.e. view point of a virtual camera while a three-dimensional game image is displayed in the display screen 106 (FIG. 9). The functions and actions of the A button 216 and B button 218 are the same as those of the A button 42 and B button 28 of the first controller 10. The X button 220 is used to change an angle of gaze around an X axis of the virtual camera, for example, and the Y button 222 is used for changing an angle of gaze around the Y axis, for example. The housing 12 of the first controller 10 is inserted from its other end (rear end) thereof into the opening of the front surface of the receiving portion 208 of the second controller 200. Then, the housing 12 is pushed into until the connector 56 of the first controller 10 is connected to the connector 210 of the receiving portion 208. By doing that, the first controller 10 is combined with the second controller 200, as shown in FIG. 14. In the state of a combination of the first controller 10 and the second controller 200, the holding portion 18 of the first controller 10 is almost buried in the receiving portion 208, as can be seen well from FIG. 14 and FIG. 15 in particular. This is because the depth of the receiving portion 208 is set as to be equal to or slightly longer than or slightly shorter than the length of the holding portion 18. Accordingly, the center of gravity of the first controller 10 is supported by the second controller 200, and thus the first controller 10 can be stably supported by the second controller 200. Moreover, the width of the receiving portion 208 is set as to be equal to or slightly longer than the width of the housing 12 of the first controller 10, and the depth of the same is formed so as to be equal to or slightly longer than the thickness of the housing 12. Thus, when the first controller 10 is inserted into or attached to the receiving portion 208 of the second controller 200, no rattle occurs between the first controller 10 and the second controller 200. In addition, as can be well understood from FIG. 15, the upper surface 20 of the housing 12 of the first controller 10 is flush with the upper surface 203 of the housing 202 of the second controller 200, and thus the first controller 10 never protrudes from the surface of the second controller 200 or interferes with the operation of the second controller 200. When the first controller 10 and the second controller 200 are combined to each other, the player holds the holding portions 204 and 206 of the housing 202 of the second controller 200 by the left hand 63 and the right hand 62, respectively, as shown in FIG. 16. In that state, there is no need for using all the operating switches and buttons of the first controller 10 but a few of them. However, the wireless transmission function of the first controller 10 and the function of the imaging information arithmetic unit can be used as they are. When the first and second controllers 10 and 200 are combined with each other as shown in FIG. 14 and FIG. 15, the electric circuit structure is as shown in FIG. 17. More specifically, in FIG. 17, the operating switches 212 to 224 are the operating switches and buttons of the second controller 200, and operation signals from these operating switches 212 to 224 are input from the connector 210 through the connector 56 into the processor 66 of the first controller 10. Accordingly, the processor 66 processes the operation signal from the second controller 200 in the same manner as the operating signals from the first controller 10, and inputs them as controller data into the wireless module 70. Therefore, the operating signals from the individual switches and buttons 212 to 24 of the second controller 200 can be wirelessly transmitted as controller data via weak radio waves from the wires module 70 through the antenna 72. As a consequence, the combination of the first controller 10 and second controller 200 functions as a wireless controller. In addition, the imaging information arithmetic unit 54 of the first controller 10 is never affected by the combination of the first controller 10 and the second controller 200. Thus, by displacing the housing 202 of the second controller 200 held by both hands as shown in FIG. 16 from side to side or up and down, it is possible to play a game with the use of the function of the imaging information arithmetic unit of the first controller 10. Besides, in the state where the first controller 10 and the second controller 200 are combined with each other, the first operating portion is typically the aforesaid direction switch 26 of the first controller 10, and the second operating portion is the A button 42 in the same sense. The third operating portion is the joystick 212 and the direction switch 214 provided in the left-hand holding portion 204 of the second controller 200. The fourth operating portion is the A button 216, etc. provided in the right-hand holding portion 206 of the second controller 200. However, the correspondences of the third operating portion and the fourth operating portion may be exchanged. In either case, the third operating portion and the fourth operating portion can be operated by the thumb 63a of the left hand 63 and the thumb 62a of the right hand 62, as shown in FIG. 16. As described above, in the first controller 10, the first operating portion (the direction switch 26) is arranged at a position that can be operated by the thumb 62, and the second operating portion (the A button 42) is arranged at a position that can be operated by the index finger 62b or the middle finger 62c when the first controller 10 is held at the holding portion 18. Thus, in the first controller 10, it is a little hard to operate the X button 44 and the Y button 46 provided within a range of the holding portion 18. On the contrary, in the second controller 200, the X button 220 and the Y button 222 are both provided in the right-hand holding portion 206 of the housing 202 and are easy to operate by the thumb 62a in the state that the holding portion 206 is held by the right hand 62 (FIG. 16). As stated above, it is possible to make the one-handed first controller 10 easier to operate by one hand by arranging a minimum required number of operating switches or keys therein. However, the aforementioned X button 44 and Y button 46, for example, may need to be operated with considerable frequency depending on the kind of a game. In the first controller 10, the X button 44 and the Y button 46 are not necessarily easy to operate because they are provided in the range of the holding portion 18. That is, the player may be dissatisfied with the first controller 10 alone due to difficulty of operating the X button 44 and the Y button 46. In this case, by combining the second controller 200 and the first controller 10, it is possible to prevent the player from having such dissatisfaction because the X button 220 and the Y button 222 of the second controller 200 are easy to operate. In addition, the joystick 212 and the direction switch 214 are arranged as direction designation means in the second controller 200 as well. Meanwhile, the joystick 212 and the direction switch 214 are provided in the left-hand holding portion 204 of the housing 202 and easy to operate by the thumb 63a in the state that the holding portion 204 is held by the left hand 63 (FIG. 16). Accordingly, when the first and second controllers 10 and 200 are combined with each other, the direction designation means also becomes easy to operate. Moreover, the direction switch 26 is originally provided in the first controller 10 at an easy-to-operate position, the direction designation means to be used with a relatively high frequency has easy operability in both the cases of the first controller 10 is used singly and in combination with the second controller 200. Besides, in the embodiment of FIG. 13 to FIG. 17, the A button 216, the B button 218, the X button 220 and the Y button 222 are arranged in the right-hand holding portion 206 of the second controller 200. Alternatively, in the case of this embodiment, it is possible to eliminate the A button 216 and the B button 218 from the second controller 200 so that only the X button 220 and the Y button 222 are arranged in the second controller 200. That is, even when the first controller 10 and the second controller 200 are combined with each other, the A button 42 and the B button 28 (FIG. 1) can be operated without hindrance, and thus it is possible to eliminate some operating switch(es) and operating button(s) with duplicate functions from the second controller 200, resulting in cost reduction. On the other hand, the X button 44 and the Y button 46 of the first controller 10 becomes hard in some degree to operate at the time of the controller combination, and the functions of these buttons are covered by the operating switches (buttons) separately provided in the second controller 200. This would eliminate the inconvenience of operation resulting from the controller combination. An embodiment shown in FIG. 18 is the same as the embodiment shown in FIG. 13 to FIG. 17 except that the operating switches provided on upper surface of the right-hand holding portion 206 of the housing 202 of the second controller 200 are slightly different from those of the embodiment shown in FIG. 13 to FIG. 16. A duplicate description is omitted below, with assignment of the same reference numerals to similar operating switches or operating buttons. In the embodiment of FIG. 18, provided on the upper surface of the right-hand holding portion 206 of the housing 202 are the A button 216, the B button 218, the X button 220, the Y button 222, a C button 226, and a D button 228. The A button 216 and the B button 218 have the same functions as those of the A button 216 and the B button of the above described embodiment. The X button 220, the Y button 222, the C button 226 and the D button 228 realize the equivalent functions of the joystick 224 of the preceding embodiments. Besides, in the embodiment of FIG. 18, the A button 216 and the B button 218 may be eliminated from the right-hand holding portion 206 of the second controller 200 so that only the X button 220 and the Y button 222 are arranged in the second controller 200, as in the case of the embodiment of FIG. 13 to FIG. 17. This makes it possible to achieve cost reduction and prevent a decrease in operability at the time of the controller combination. An embodiment of FIG. 19 is identical with the embodiment of FIG. 13 to FIG. 17 and the embodiment of FIG. 18 except for a point described below. Specifically, in both the embodiment of FIG. 13 to FIG. 16 and the embodiment of FIG. 18, the housing 202 has a sufficient width (in the longitudinal direction of the first controller 10) and thus the holding portion 18 of the first controller 10 is almost buried in the housing 202 of the second controller 200. On the contrary, in the embodiment of FIG. 19, the width of the housing 202 is slightly smaller as compared with the embodiment of FIG. 13 to FIG. 16 and the embodiment of FIG. 18, most part of the holding portion 18 of the first controller 10 is exposed from the housing 202. Accordingly, this embodiment is slightly unstable as compared with the preceding embodiments. However, the upper surfaces 20 and 203 of the respective housings 12 and 202 of the first controller 10 and second controller 200 are flush with each other as in the cases of the preceding embodiments. Since the width of the housing 202 is slightly shorter, the joystick 212 provided in the left-hand holding portion 204 of the housing 202 of FIG. 18 embodiment is omitted and some changes are made to the switches of the right-hand holding portion 206 in this embodiment. In this embodiment, only the A button 216, the B button 218, the X button 220 and the Y button 222 are arranged in the right-hand holding portion 206. Besides, in the embodiment of FIG. 19, the A button 216 and the B button 218 of the right-hand holding portion 206 of the second controller 200 may be eliminated so that only the X button 220 and the Y button 222 are arranged in the second controller 200, as in the case of the embodiment of FIG. 13 to FIG. 17. This makes it possible to achieve cost reduction and prevent a decrease in operability with the controller combination. An embodiment of FIG. 20 is the same as the embodiment of FIG. 19 except for a point described below. Specifically, as with the FIG. 19 embodiment, the holding portion 18 of the first controller 10 protrudes or is exposed longer from the housing 202 of the second controller 200 as compared with the embodiment of FIG. 13 to FIG. 16 and the embodiment of FIG. 18. Thus, also in this embodiment, only the A button 216 and the B button 218 are provided in the right-hand holding portion 206 of the housing 202. Alternatively, these buttons 216 and 218 may function as X button and Y button, not as A button and B button. Shown in FIG. 21 is a gun-type adapter 300. The adapter 300 has a butt 302 for holding by hand, as with general gun-type controllers. The butt 302 is provided with a trigger 306 surrounded by a trigger guard 304. A gun barrel 308 extends from the butt 302 through a magazine. Besides, the gun barrel 308 can be detached by a connector 310 with respect to the butt 302. In addition, by pulling out the gun barrel 308 from the connector 310 and inserting the connector 60 of the controller 10 into a connector 310, the first controller 10 can be attached instead of the gun barrel 308. In this case, it is possible to make the shooting game more interesting by allowing the trigger 306 to be used in place of the A button 42 of the controller 10. In the first controller 10 of an embodiment shown in FIG. 23, the operating switches and buttons 24 to 32, 44 and 46 are changed in shape and layout as compared with the embodiment of FIG. 1. The direction switch 26, in particular, employs not the combined switch of FIG. 1 embodiment but a direction switch formed of a cross key frequently used in game machines. The cross key, i.e. the direction switch 26 may be identical with the direction switch 214 of the second controller 200. Also, in the first controller 10 of this embodiment, the start switch 30 and the select switch 32 are arranged in a sideway line, not arranged in the shape of the character “” as with the preceding embodiments. Moreover, a plurality of (four in this embodiment) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) 821, 822, 823 and 824 are provided at one end (front end) of the upper surface 20 of the controller 10 of this embodiment. Light from the LEDs 821 to 824 can be visually recognized from outside, but they are buried in the upper surface 20 of the housing 12 and thus do not appear to protrude in FIG. 23 (B). Alternatively, it is absolutely acceptable that they are arranged so as to appear to protrude. When the first controller 10 transmits a radio wave signal as a controller signal (controller data), these LEDs 821 to 824 indicate the number of the controller because the LED corresponding to the controller number is turned on. For example, when the game machine 112 shown in FIG. 9 is designed to accept four controllers at a time, each of four game players uses the first controller 10. The selective lighting of the LEDs 821 to 824 allows each of the users to ascertain which is his/her own controller, out of the first to fourth ones. When the LED 821 of his/her controller 10 is turned on, for instance, the player can understand that the controller is assigned as first controller. Additionally, in the embodiment of FIG. 23, the front-end surface 52 of the housing 10 is formed as an inclined surface, not a surface orthogonal to an axis along the longitudinal direction of the housing 12, unlike the preceding embodiments. Also, the imaging device 56 of the imaging information arithmetic unit is attached to the inclined front-end surface, and thus a central axis in the imaging range of the imaging information arithmetic unit, i.e. the imaging device 56 crosses obliquely the axis along the longitudinal direction of the housing 12. Accordingly, the housing 12 can be inclined on the whole by holding the housing 12 at the holding portion 18 and facing the inclined front-end surface 52, i.e. the imaging device 56 straight toward the screen 106 of the display 104. Consequently, according to this embodiment, the player may feel less tiredness on his/her hand in operating the controller 10 in his/her chair, for example. That is, in the preceding embodiments, the front-end surface of the housing 12 is orthogonal to the axis along the longitudinal direction. Accordingly, in facing the imaging device 56 attached thereto straight toward the screen 106, it is necessary to hold the controller 10 in such a manner that the upper surface 20 of the housing 12 is faced upward and that the axis is in a horizontal state. Also, in that state, the imaging device 56 needs to be brought to a place within the screen 106. In that case, the wrist of the hand holding the holding portion 18 may be under too much tension. On the contrary, in the embodiment of FIG. 23, the imaging device 56 can be faced straight toward the screen 106 even while holding the housing 12 by the wrist at a natural angle or in a natural state. This makes it possible to reduce the tiredness on the player's wrist without causing excessive stress on it. Based on the same idea, as with an embodiment shown in FIG. 25, a front end 12H of the housing 12 of the controller 10 is separated from another part and is attached to a front end of the other part by means of a shaft 84. By doing this, since the front end 12H can be folded in such a manner as indicated by dotted lines if required, an imaging surface of the imaging device 56 of the imaging information arithmetic unit is displaced according to that, as shown in FIG. 25. Thus, as with the embodiments shown in FIG. 23 and FIG. 24, the effect of reducing wrist tiredness can be expected. Besides, if this is not required for the embodiment of FIG. 25, the front end 12H may be in an upright state (a state indicated by solid lines in FIG. 25) according to the axis along the longitudinal direction. FIG. 26 to FIG. 28 represents still another embodiment of the first controller 10. The controller 10 of this embodiment is identical with the controller of the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 except for points described below. Duplicate descriptions are omitted below with assignment of the same reference numerals to the same or similar components. The controller 10 of this embodiment also includes the housing 12 of a longitudinal and cross rectangular shape or a shape close thereto that is structured by the lower housing 14 and the upper housing 16. Also, the holding portion 18 of a size or thickness capable of being held by one hand is formed at the rear end of the housing 12. In addition, the direction switch 26 is arranged on the upper surface 20 of the housing 12, at the side (front end) opposite to the holding portion 18 in the longitudinal direction C1 (FIG. 27). Besides, in this embodiment, the direction switch 26 is a so-called cross key, not a combined switch such as that of the FIG. 1 embodiment. Additionally, the A button 42 is provided below (near the rear end) of the cross key, i.e. the direction switch 26, at center of the housing 12 in a width direction. In the preceding embodiments, the A button 42 is provided in the concave portion 34 on the bottom surface 22 of the housing 12, and in this embodiment, the A button 42 is changed so as to be arranged on the upper surface 20 of the housing 12. This is intended to allow the A button 42 to be operated by the thumb quickly and reliably because the A button 42 is operated more frequently than the B button 28, as can be well understood from FIG. 29 described later, for example. The direction switch 26 and the A button 42 correspond to the first operating portion in this embodiment. Accordingly, the direction switch 26 and the A button 42 are a key top pushed in a direction orthogonal to the first plane 20 and a push switch having contacts (not shown) operated by the key top. Moreover, in this embodiment, as understood well from FIG. 27(C) especially, a height H1 from the first plane 20 of the key top of the cross switch, i.e. the direction switch 26 is made higher as compared with a height H2 from the first plane 20 of the key top of the A button 42. That is, the direction switch 26 is set to be higher than the A button 42. This aims to prevent the A button 42 from being pushed by accident while the cross key, i.e. the direction switch 26 is operated. The start switch 30 and the select switch 32 are arranged in one straight line in a direction orthogonal to the longitudinal direction (width direction), and also a menu switch 86 is provided between them. The menu switch 86 is used to select a menu item of a game to be executed by means of the controller 10 (for example, a one-person play mode, a match-up mode, etc.) and to switch the game mode instantly to the menu to be provided immediately after the startup of the game machine or the like. The center of the menu switch 86 is aligned with that of the A button 42 in the width direction of the housing 12, and the start switch 30 and the select switch 32 are arranged at positions with uniform spacing at left and right from the menu switch 86 (i.e. the A button 42). With such a button layout as mentioned above, in manipulating the controller 10 with the right hand, for example, the player can operate the select switch 32 quickly just by sliding the thumb placed on the A button 42 without having to bending the thumb. Additionally, in the case of operation with the left hand, the start switch 30 is a switch suitable for a quick operation in the same manner. Accordingly, it is possible to perform a quick operation regardless of whether the user is right-handed or left-handed, by making a change to the assignments of the select switch 32 and the start switch 30 through the use of a software program or the like. Besides, the menu switch 86 and the power switch 24 are provided in such a manner as to be caved in or buried in holes formed on the upper surface 20 of the housing 12 so that they are invisible from a side view as shown in FIG. 27 (C). These switches 24 and 86 are caved because, although they may be operated only on specific occasions such as the time of starting the game, operating these switches by accident during the game would cause some inconvenience such as data loss, and thus these switches are designed to be capable of being intentionally operated at the game start but incapable of being unconsciously operated during the game. Furthermore, in the controller 10 of this embodiment, the LEDs 821 to 824 for indicating the controller numbers are provided as with the controller of FIG. 23. However, the LEDs 821 to 824 of FIG. 23 embodiment are provided at one end (front end) of the housing 12, whereas those of this embodiment are arranged at the other end (rear end) of the housing 12. The concave portion 34 is formed on the lower surface 22 of the housing, at a position approximately corresponding to the position of the above mentioned direction switch 26, on the side opposite to the holding portion 18 in the longitudinal direction. In the preceding embodiments, the concave portion 34 has the valley 36 with a plane parallel to the first plane 20, and in this embodiment, the concave portion 34 has no valley and includes the first inclined surface 38 and the second inclined part 40 that have gentle inclination. Also, the B button 28 is provided on the first inclined surface 38 extending in the direction of the holding portion 18. In addition, the B button 28 is provided at a position corresponding to the direction switch 26 and the A button 42 forming the first operating portion. Besides, the corresponding position denotes a position where the B button 28 is arranged close to the direction switch 26 and the A button 42 when viewed through the upper surface of the housing 12. Besides, the A button is arranged on the lower surface of the housing in the preceding embodiments, whereas the A button 42 of this embodiment is arranged at a position easier to press as compared with the center switch of the preceding embodiments. Thus, this button is assumed to be the frequently-used A button and the switch on the lower surface 22 of the housing is assumed to be the B button, which makes button operations to be easier. Additionally, in this embodiment, the B button 28 corresponds to the second operating portion. The B button 28 therefore has a key top to be pushed in a direction perpendicular to the inclined surface 38 but non-perpendicular to the first plane 20, and a contact (not shown) turned on or off by the key top. Moreover, in this embodiment, an angle of inclination of the second inclined surface 40 extending toward the front end 52 of the housing 12, with respect to the first plane 20 is set as to be smaller than an angle of inclination of the first inclined surface 38 with respect to the first plane 20, as can be well understood from FIG. 26 and FIG. 27 (C). That is, the second inclined surface 40 has gentle inclination as compared with the first inclined surface 38. In this manner, by making the second inclined surface 40 more gentle in inclination than the first inclined surface 38, there are such advantages that it is easier to hold the controller with both hands as shown in FIG. 32 described later and it is possible to take the index finger properly off the B button 28 because the finger can be sufficiently moved in the direction of the takeoff. Furthermore, as can be understood from FIG. 28, because of a layout of the start switch 30, the menu switch 86 and the select switch 32 arranged in one horizontal straight line, in this embodiment, the wireless module 70 is arranged on the right side of the housing 12 in the width direction. Also, the power switch 24 is provided on the left side of the housing 12 of the substrate 64 in the width direction, in contrast to the preceding embodiments, and the antenna pattern 72 is arranged at the front end on the right side of the substrate 64 in the width direction. As stated above, by arranging the antenna pattern 72 at the front end on the right side of the housing 12 in the width direction, there is such an advantage that, even in the case of holding with both hands as shown in FIG. 32, the emission of weak radio waves from the antenna 72 is not affected by the hands holding the housing 12, that is, the controller 10. That is, the antenna pattern 72 is arranged on the side opposite to the hands holding the controller 10, in the width direction of the housing 12. Besides, in the embodiment of FIG. 26 to FIG. 28, the switch provided in the concave portion 34 on the lower surface of the housing 12 is the B button 28. Alternatively, the B button 28 may be replaced with an operating means having the functions of the Z button. In addition, the Z button is used as a trigger switch in a shooting game, for example, and also operated on occasions when a non-player object is to be targeted by a player object (a so-called Z-targeting feature), etc. FIG. 29 and FIG. 30 show the state that the controller 10 such structured as stated above is held by the game player's hand. Referring to these drawings, the palm 62P and the balls of middle finger 62c, ring finger 62d and small finger 62e of the player's right hand 62 hold the holding portion 18 of the housing 12 in such a manner as to wrap the holding portion 18 lightly. In the state, the thumb 62a of the hand 62 is positioned on the direction switch 26, and the index finger 62b is positioned in the concave portion 34 of the lower housing 14. Specifically, the direction switch 26 is arranged at a position reached by the thumb 62a of the hand 62 holding the housing 12, that is, at a position capable of being operated by the thumb 62a. The B button 28 is arranged at a position reached by the index finger 62b of the hand 62 holding the housing 12, that is, at a position capable of being operated by the index finger 62b. Accordingly, the player can operate the direction switch 26 by the thumb 62a and operate the B button 28 by the index finger 62b while holding the housing 12 by the hand 62. More specifically, the index finger 62b of the hand 62 is positioned in such a manner as to make contact with the surface of the second inclined surface 40 having gentle inclination in the front-end direction of the above stated concave portion 34 formed in the lower housing 14. By bending the index finger 62b toward him/her (rightward in FIG. 29) in that state, the user can push the key top of the B button 28 by the ball of the index finger 62b in a direction perpendicular to the near-side inclined surface 38 of the concave portion 34. Additionally, in the case of this embodiment, the A button 42 is to be operated by the thumb 62a of the one hand 62 as with the direction switch 26, as can be seen well from FIG. 29 in particular. That is, in this embodiment, the direction switch 26 is operated by extending the thumb 62a and the A button 42 is operated by bending the thumb 62a. As a consequence, both the direction switch 26 and the A button 42 are operated by the thumb 62a. Thus, the thumb 62a may also be placed in an operation-waiting state (rest state) on the A button 42, not on the direction switch 26. FIG. 29 shows a state that the B button (or the Z button) 28 is pushed by the index finger 62b. When it is not required to push the B button 28, the index finger 62b (or the middle finger 62c) may be taken off the B button 28. More specifically, by placing the index finger 62b (or the middle finger 62c) on the second inclined surface 40 of the concave portion 34, it is possible to make the index finger 62b (the middle finger 62c) stable in the state of being separated from the B button 28. Thus, there is no need for changing the state of holding the housing 12 (passing the housing 12 from one hand to the other) depending on whether or not to push the B button (or Z button) 28. As described above, the controller 10 of this embodiment makes it easy to operate the first operating portion (the direction switch 26 and the A button 42 in the embodiment) and the second operating portion (the A button 42 in the embodiment) while holding the controller 10 by one hand. That is, in the controller 10 of this embodiment, it is possible to operate the individual operating portions in a stable manner while holding the controller 10 by one hand, which brings about a highly favorable effect of allowing the other hand to be used for playing a game or for another purpose, and which also makes it possible to perform operations in a state of holding by both hands. FIG. 32 shows the state of holding by both hands. Additionally, in this embodiment, the A button 42 is arranged at a place on the holding portion in vicinity of the direction switch 26. Moreover, the B button 28 is arranged at the back of the area in which the direction switch 26 and the A button 42 are arranged (in other words, slightly rearward of the immediate back of the direction switch 26), which makes it easy to operate the A button 42 and the B button by one hand in a stable manner. Furthermore, as stated above, since the direction switch 26 is in a higher position than the A button 42, it is possible to make the A button hard to press by mistake. In the case of holding by both hands, as shown in FIG. 32, the front end of the housing 12 is held by the left hand 63, and the rear end of the housing 12 is held by the right hand 62. At that time, with commonality between the right hand and the left hand, the controller 10, i.e. the housing 12 is held in such a manner that the upper surface 20 (FIG. 27) is retained by the balls of the thumbs 62a and 63a and the bottom surface 22 (FIG. 27) is supported by the sides of the index fingers 62b and 63b. Accordingly, the direction switch 26 and the A button 42 are operated by the ball of the thumb 63a of the left hand 63, and the B button 28 (FIG. 26 and FIG. 27) is operated by the tip of the index finger 63b of the left hand. Also, the X button 44 and the Y button 46 are operated by the thumb 62a of the right hand 62. However, in the case of holding by both hands, the manner in which the controller is held, and the hands and fingers to operate the individual operating switches and operating buttons are not limited to the example of FIG. 32. Thus, for example, it is possible to operate the A button 42 by reaching out the thumb 62a of the right hand 62 or the like. Besides, holding in such a manner as shown in FIG. 32 would prevent radio emission through the antenna 72 (FIG. 28) from being affected by the holding hand.
