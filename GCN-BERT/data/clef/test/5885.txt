Step 3. 3-(4-Aminoimidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-4-(methyl-d3)benzenesulfonyl chloride
7-(2-(methyl-d3)phenyl)imidazo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-4-amine (214 mg, 0.937 mmol) in DCM (2 mL) was stirred at 0° C. for 10 minutes. Chlorosulfonic acid (0.44 mL, 6.6 mmol) was added dropwise. The ice bath was removed, and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After 2.5 hours at room temperature, the mixture was heated for 2 hours in an 50 OC oil bath. Upon cooling, the reaction mixture was diluted with DCM (5 mL) and added to a stirring mixture of ice (10 g) and DCM (10 mL) kept in an ice-bath. The precipitated product was isolated by filtration and rinsed with DCM. The biphasic filtrate was extracted with DCM (2×), and the combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated and the solid so obtained was combined with the initial solid product isolated by filtration (total: 253 mg light yellow solid powder, 83%). LCMS for C12H8D3ClN5O2S (M+H)+: calculated m/z=327.0, found 327.1.
