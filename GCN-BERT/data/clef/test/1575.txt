TECHNICAL FIELD 10003] The present application relates generally to machine translation for ecommerce transactions. BACKGROUND [0004] The use of mobile devices, such as cellphones, smartphones, tablets, and laptop computers, has increased rapidly in recent years, which, along with the rise in dominance of the Internet as the primary mechanism for communication, has caused an explosion in electronic commerce ("ecommerce"). As these factors spread throughout the world, communications between users that utilize different spoken or written languages increase exponentially. Ecommerce poses unique challenges when dealing with differing languages because an ecommerce transaction often requires specific information to be highly accurate. For example, if a potential buyer asks a seller about some aspect of a product for sale, the answer should be precise and accurate. Any failing irs the accuracy of the answer could result irs a lost sale or an unhappy purchaser.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [ΘΘ15] Example methods and systems for machine translation (MT) for ecommerce are provided. It will be evident, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present inventive subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. [ΘΘ1 ] According to various exemplary embodiments, MT for ecommerce comprises translating a query in a first language to a query in a second language and querying an ecommerce database that is maintained in the second language to obtain a result set of items in the second language that is responsive and faithful to the query in the first language. Relevancy of the result set of items to the user of the first language is measured and is used to form an ontology that may be used to optimize translation of queries in the first language to queries in the second language. In example embodiments the languages of Russian and English are used as the first language and the second language, respectively , but it will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art that any two languages may be used as the first and second languages. [0017] FIG. 1 is a network diagram depicting a client-server system 100, within which one example embodiment may be deployed. A networked system 102, in the example forms of a network-based marketplace or publication system, provides server-side functionality, via a network 104 (e.g., the Internet or a Wide Area Network (WAN)), to one or more clients. FIG. 1 illustrates, for example, a web client 106 (e.g., a browser, such as the Internet Explorer browser developed by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Washington State) and a programmatic client 108 executing on respective devices 1 10 and 112. [0018] An Application Program Interface (API) server 114 and a web server 1 16 are coupled to, and provide programmatic and web interfaces respectively to, one or more application servers 1 18. The application servers 1 18 host one or more marketplace applications 120 and payment applications 122. The application servers 11 8 are, in turn, shown to be coupled to one or more database servers 124 that facilitate access to one or more databases 126. [0019] The marketplace applications 120 may provide a number of marketplace functions and services to users who access the networked system 102. The payment applications 122 may likewise provide a number of payment services and functions to users. The payment applications 122 may allow users to accumulate value (e.g., in a commercial currency, such as the U.S. dollar, or a proprietary currency, such as "points") in accounts, and then later to redeem the accumulated value for products (e.g., goods or sendees) that are made available via the marketplace applications 120. While the marketplace and payment applications 120 and 122 are shown in FIG. 1 to both form part of the networked system 102, it will be appreciated that, in alternative embodiments, the payment applications 122 may form part of a payment service that is separate and distinct from the networked system 102. [0020] Further, while the system 100 shown in FIG. 1 employs a client- server architecture, the embodiments are, of course, not limited to such an architecture, and could equally well find application in a distributed, or peer-to- peer, architecture system, for example. The various marketplace and payment applications 120 and 122 could also be implemented as standalone software programs, which do not necessarily have networking capabilities. [0021] The web client 106 accesses the various marketplace and payment applications 120 and 122 via the web interface supported by the web server 116. Similarly, the programmatic client 108 accesses the various services and functions provided by the marketplace and payment applications 120 and 122 via the programmatic interface provided by the API server 114. The programmatic client 108 may, for example, be a seller application (e.g., the TurboLister application developed by eBay Inc., of San Jose, California) to enable sellers to author and manage listings on the networked system 102 in an off-line manner, and to perform batch-mode communications between the programmatic client 108 and the networked system 102, [0022] FIG. 1 also illustrates a third party application 128, executing on a third party server machine 130, as having programmatic access to the networked system 102 via the programmatic interface provided by the API server 1 14. For example, the third part application 128 may, utilizing information retrieved from the networked system 102, support one or more features or functions on a website hosted by the third party. The third party website may, for example, provide one or more promotional, marketplace, or payment functions that are supported by the relevant applications of the networked system 102. [0023] FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating marketplace and payment applications 120 and 122 that, in one example embodiment, are provided as part of application server(s) 1 18 in the networked system 102. The applications 120 and 122 may be hosted on dedicated or shared server machines (rsot shown) that are communicatively coupled to enable communications between server machines. The applications 120 and 122 themselves are communicatively coupled (e.g., via appropriate interfaces) to each other and to various data sources, so as to allow information to be passed between the applications 120 and 122 or so as to allow the applications 120 and 122 to share and access common data. The applications 120 and 122 may furthermore access one or more databases 126 via the database servers 124. [ΘΘ24] The networked system 102 may provide a number of publishing, listing, and price-setting mechanisms whereby a seller may list (or publish information concerning) goods or services for sale, a buyer can express interest in or indicate a desire to purchase such goods or services, and a price can be set for a transaction pertaining to the goods or services. To this end, the marketplace and payment applications 120 and 122 are shown to include at least one publication application 200 and one or more auction applications 202, which support auction-format listing and price setting mechanisms (e.g., English, Dutch, Vickrey, Chinese, Double, Reverse auctions, etc.). The various auction applications 202 may also provide a number of features in support of such auction-format listings, such as a reserve price feature whereby a seller may specify a reserve price in connection with a listing and a proxy-bidding feature whereby a bidder may invoke automated proxy bidding. [0025] A number of fixed-price applications 204 support fixed-price listing formats (e.g., the traditional classified advertisement-type listing or a catalogue listing) and buyout-type listings. Specifically, buyout-type listings (e.g., including the Buy-It-Now (BIN) technology developed by eBay Inc., of San Jose, California) may be offered in conjunction with auction-format listings, and allow a buyer to purchase goods or services, which are also being offered for sale via an auction, for a fixed-price that is typically higher than the starting price of the auction. [ΘΘ26] Store applications 206 allow a seller to group listings within a "virtual" store, which may be branded and otherwise personalized by and for the b seller. Such a virtual store may also offer promotions, incentives, and features that are specific and personalized to a relevant seller. [ΘΘ27] Reputation applications 208 allow users who transact, utilizing the networked system 102, to establish, build, and maintain reputations, which may be made available and published to potential trading partners. Consider that where, for example, the networked system 102 supports person-to-person trading, users may otherwise have no history or other reference information whereby the trustworthiness and credibility of potential trading partners may be assessed. The reputation applications 208 allow a user (for example, through feedback provided by other transaction partners) to establish a reputation within the networked system 102 over time. Other potential trading partners may then reference such a reputation for the purposes of assessing credibility and trustworthiness. [0028] Personalization applications 210 allow users of the networked system 102 to personalize various aspects of their interactions with the networked system 102. For example a user may, utilizing an appropriate personalization application 2,10, create a personalized reference page at which information regarding transactions to which the user is (or has been) a party may be viewed. Further, a personalization application 210 may enable a user to personalize listings and other aspects of their interactions with the networked system 102 and other parties. [0029] The networked system 102 may support a number of marketplaces that are customized, for example, for specific geographic regions. A version of the networked system 102 may be customized for the United Kingdom, whereas another version of the networked system 102 may be customized for the United States. Each of these versions may operate as an independent marketplace or may be customized (or internationalized) presentations of a common underlying marketplace. The networked system 102 may accordingly include a number of internationalization applications 212 that customize information (and/or the presentation of information by the networked system 102) according to predetermined criteria (e.g., geographic, demographic or marketplace criteria). For example, the internationalization applications 212 may be used to support the customization of information for a number of r D regional websites that are operated by the networked system 102 and that are accessible via respective web servers 1 16. [ΘΘ30] Navigation of the networked system 102 may be facilitated by one or more navigation applications 214. For example, a search application (as an example of a navigation application 214) may enable key word searches of listings published via the networked system 102. A browse application may allow users to browse various category, catalogue, or inventory data structures according to which listings may be classified within the networked system 102, Various other navigation applications 214 may be provided to supplement the search and browsing applications. [0031] In order to make listings available via the networked system 102 as visually informing and attractive as possible, the applications 120 and 122 may include one or more imaging applications 216, which users may utilize to upload images for inclusion within listings. An imaging application 216 also operates to incorporate images within viewed listings. The imaging applications 216 may also support one or more promotional features, such as image galleries that are presented to potential buyers. For example, sellers may pay an additional fee to have an image included within a gallery of images for promoted items. [0032] Listing creation applications 218 allow sellers to conveniently author listings pertaining to goods or services that they wish to transact via the networked system 102, and listing management applications 220 allow sellers to manage such listings. Specifically, where a particular seller has authored and/or published a large number of listings, the management of such listings may present a challenge. The listing management applications 220 provide a number of features (e.g., auto-relisting, inventory level monitors, etc.) to assist the seller in managing such listings. One or more post-listing management applications 222 also assist sellers with a number of activities that typically occur post- listing. For example, upon completion of an auction facilitated by one or more auction applications 202, a seller may wish to leave feedback regarding a particular buyer. To this end, a post-listing management application 222 may provide an interface to one or more reputation applications 208, so as to allow the seller conveniently to provide feedback regarding multiple buyers to the reputation applications 208. [ΘΘ33] Dispute resolution applications 224 provide mechanisms whereby disputes arising between transacting parties may be resolved. For example, the dispute resolution applications 224 may provide guided procedures whereby the parties are guided through a number of steps in an attempt to settle a dispute. In the event that the dispute cannot be settled via the guided procedures, the dispute may be escalated to a third party mediator or arbitrator. [ΘΘ34] A number of fraud prevention applications 226 implement fraud detection and prevention mechanisms to reduce the occurrence of fraud within the networked system 102. [ΘΘ35] Messaging applications 228 are responsible for the generation and deliver}' of messages to users of the networked system 102 (such as, for example, messages advising users regarding the status of listings at the networked system 102 (e.g., providing "outbid" notices to bidders during an auction process or to provide promotional and merchandising information to users)). Respective messaging applications 228 may utilize any one of a number of message delivery networks and platforms to deliver messages to users. For example, messaging applications 228 may deliver electronic mail (e-mail), instant message (IM), Short Message Service (SMS), text, facsimile, or voice (e.g., Voice over IP (VoIP)) messages via the wired (e.g., the Internet), plain old telephone sendee (POTS), or wireless (e.g., mobile, cellular, WiFi, WiMAX) networks 104. [ΘΘ36] Merchandising applications 230 support various merchandising functions that are made available to sellers to enable sellers to increase sales via. the networked system 102. The merchandising applications 230 also operate the various merchandising features that may be invoked by sellers, and may monitor and track the success of merchandising strategies employed by sellers. [0037] The networked system 102 itself, or one or more parties that transact via the networked system 102, may operate loyalty programs that are supported by one or more loyalty/promotions applications 232. For example, a buyer may earn loyalty or promotion points for each transaction established and/or concluded with a particular seller, and be offered a reward for which accumulated loyalty points can be redeemed, [ΘΘ38] A machine translation application 234 may translate a query in a first language to a query in a second language, obtain and build an ontology based on keywords of the query in the first language combined with user feedback indicating the relevancy of a result set obtained by the query that is translated into the second language. This ontology is defined by the users of the first language and may be developed from measuring the relevancy of the result set. A more detailed vie of a machine translation application in accordance with an embodiment is seen in FIG. 2 A. [0039] The machine translation application 234 is seen in additional detail in F1G.2A. FIG. 2A is a block diagram illustrating an example machine translation applications 234 according to an example embodiment. The machine translation applications 234 comprise Russian to English translation module 236, English to Russian translation module 238, and ontology build application 240, Russian to English translation module 236 may be used to translate a query in the Russian language to a query in the English language, as more fully described at 306 in FIG. 3. English to Russian translation module 238 may be used to translate an English result set from the English language to the Russian language, as more fully described at 318 in FIG. 3, Ontology build application 240 can be used to build an ontology that may be used to optimize translating a query from the Russian language to a query in the English language, also as more fully discussed with respect to FIG. 3. Ontology build application 240 comprises user feedback monitoring module 242, query context learning module 244 and translation optimizing module 246. User feedback monitoring module 242 is used to monitor user feedback for measuring relevancy of a result set that is provided to a user in response to a query in the Russian language, as more fully described at 318 of FIG. 3. Query context learning module 244 is used to learn semantic relationships between keywords in a query as more fully described at 328 of FIG. 3. Translation optimizing module 246 is used to optimize the translation of the Russian query to the English query as more fully described with respect to 306 of FIG. 3. The operation of the above modules comprising machine translation application 234 is also more fully described with respect to the method illustrated in the flowchart of FIG. 4, [ΘΘ40] The user feedback module 242 can detect user feedback from a client machine either as explicit user feedback or implicit user feedback. Explicit user feedback can comprise an input from a user rating the usefulness of the results set. The implicit user feedback can be determined from user interaction with the client machine after receiving the results set. For example, a user could select a result to obtain further details, to set up a watch for an item in the result set, or to purchase an item in the results set. These user interactions can be detected and used as implicit positive feedback indicating that the results set was useful and hence the translation was 'correct' i.e. provided useful results. In comparison, detection of no user interaction with the result set (e.g. the user executes another query) within a time period after presentation of the result set to the user, can be taken as a negative feedback. [0041] Machine translation (MT) is usually focused on the translation of regular sentences of text, from political text, technical descriptions, and the like. However, MT has heretofore not been focused on the needs of a user of an ecommerce system (or other publication system). In MT of regular sentences, the objective is usually to maximize fluency, such as pieces of fluently readable text. In MT for ecommerce, however, the objective is not pieces of fluent, readable text but rather fidelity. In other words, when a user enters a query in an ecommerce system, the system focuses on keywords so that the items the system returns to the user are items that the user considers to have semantic value, or relevancy, to the query. A query may include one or more keyword descriptions of a product or service for which a search is being performed for by a user. Standard MT from one language to another, for example, Russian to English, is directed to text. In this standard type of MT, missing a word may not have a seriously negative impact on the reader. However, in ecommerce, losing even one semantic components of a user query (or keyword description of the item queried) might result in the user not purchasing the queried item from the ecommerce system or, worse, purchasing the wrong item, and in either case experiencing the user session as a negative experience. This potential deficiency could motivate the user not to use that particular ecommerce system in the future, which is a loss to the ecommerce system. Consequently, in MT for ecommerce the focus can be said to be primarily on fidelity, not fluency, where fidelity can be viewed as returning to the user a list of items that have semantic relevancy to the user query. [ΘΘ42] Stated another way, using metrics that measure ho readable translated text is, such as is done using the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) or METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering) metrics, may result in fluent translations. But, as alluded to above, in ecommerce the objective is to obtain precision and recall such the overall machine translation provides a good experience for the user, by providing the user quick access to the queried item with little or no error. Otherwise the user may make a bad decision because incorrect items were returned to the user, the result being an unhappy customer who is unlikely to be a repeat customer. Hence, BLEU or METEOR metrics are of little use in MT for ecommerce. [0043] Therefore a new metric is needed to determine whether the item set that is returned to the user in response to the query results in a good user experience. This metric may measure user feedback related to the returned item set. The probability of providing a good user experience may be increased by combining MT with user feedback. [0044] Products and services offered for sale on ecommerce web sites are listed in multiple languages on multiple web sites. For example, ecommerce systems such as eBay maintain web sites in different languages for different countries. eBay has sites in the United States, the UK, Russia, Spain, France, and others, 10045] FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating a method of optimizing machine translation to focus on ecommerce keywords language translation according to an example embodiment. FIG. 3 describes a method in which a query in the Russian language may be translated into English using MT, and the English translation of the Russian query would be used to search an ecommerce system's English database for the item that was queried in Russian. User feedback relating to returned items, and word context, allows an ontology to be built that may be used to optimize the foregoing translation. [0046] FIG. 3 illustrates three layers, a user layer, an MT layer, and ecommerce layer. A user may enter a query for an item at query interface 302 in the Russian language. The query is coupled over 304 to a Russian to English translation application 306 in the MT layer. The output 308 is the English translation of the Russian query and may be coupled to an ecommerce quer application 310 in the ecommerce layer. The site at which the English translation query 308 is used may be an English language site, such as eBay's United States site or UK site. A database 314 is queried to access items in the ecommerce site inventory that match the query. The result of that query, called here the English result set and which may be ecommerce listings for items that meet the query, may be transmitted over 316 to English to Russian translation application 318 in the MT layer. The listings of items in the English result set 316 may be translated back into Russian by English to Russian translation application 318 to generate a user list 322 of items in Russian, which may be transmitted to the Russian user. [ΘΘ47] In typical MT having to do with text, there would be an interest in comparing the Russian query at 304 to the English translation of that Russian query at 308, er se. However, as discussed, the objective in MT for ecommerce is quite different. In MT for ecommerce the concern is not the comparison of the Russian to English translation. Instead, the concern is fidelity, or how relevant the English result set 316 is to the Russian query. In other words, the actual translation may even be viewed as hidden because what is important in MT for ecommerce is the fidelity of the result sets presented to the Russian user, responsive to the Russian query. [0048] Measuring the fidelity, or relevancy, of the return set may be done using ecommerce metrics of recall and precision. Recall, as used in this context, is a measure of how large is the number of listings in the recall set. Precision is a measure of how much of that recall set is relevant to the query. High recall and high precision is the result that is sought after, implying that the result set is large (high recall) and comprises primarily relevant item listings (high precision). In one embodiment, the number of items in the English result set 316 may be used as a measure of recall. The higher the number of items in the result set the better the translation, usually, because if the translation were poor there would be relatively few items returned in the English result set. In addition, the actions of the user at 302 in response to receiving the result set may be viewed as a positive or negative user action. A positive user action, such as purchasing an item in the result set, or placing a product watch after receiving the result set, may be monitored by ontology build application 328, and used to build an ontology over a massive number of user sessions. The ontology may then be used at 330 to optimize the Russian to English translation at Russian to English translation application 306. [ΘΘ49] In one embodiment, feedback provides an indication of the relevancy of the result sets 324. The relevancy may be measured by the ontology build application 328 that builds an ontology by abstracting information from the user feedback at 326. This measurement of the relevancy of results set 324 may be accomplished in a number of ways. With continued reference to FIG. 3, the ontology of relationships can be built, as alluded to above, by ontology build application 328 from the data of user sessions by focusing on keywords in the Russian query. This may be done continuously by ontology build application 328. Large ecommerce systems such as eBay host millions of user sessions each day. By looking at a massive number of user sessions continuously, the ontology build application can abstract information from user feedback and learn from that user feedback in order to build an ontology that can be used to optimize MT for ecommerce. But it is the users who actually define the ontology. Users do this by the products and sendees they place in the user queries, so that ontologies do not need to be defined explicitly by linguists but instead are learned implicitly from the data. Also, extrapolation may be done on a continual basis with only slight delay due to system infrastructure and, as the ecommerce system infrastructure improves, the delay may become shorter and shorter so that eventually the extrapolation from user sessions may be done in nearly real time. As this process continues over years and, perhaps, over decades, changes in the meaning of words that occur over time in a given language may be accounted for by the extrapolation from the user sessions over time. In other words, as word meanings changes, the system may adapt to changes in the language over time and the ontology that is continually being built by extrapolation will automatically account for, or reflect, those changes in meanings. Use cases may change over time, and there may be new use cases, but the ontology will be up to date with language changes over time. If the ontology were defined explicitly by linguists, the system may not adapt to changes in language meaning over time. |ΘΘ5Θ] As one extrapolation example, consider a result set 324 that may be relevant because it results in a positive action by the user, such as a purchase, or the like. If the user query that resulted in the positive action describes "dress" and "burgundy," then the system learns that "burgundy" in the context of "dress" cannot the same as "burgundy" in the context of "glass" (like a burgundy wine glass). Assume for the sake of example, that statistically ten users query "glass" in Russian and receive result sets from the English ecommerce site. If four of those users describe the quer to include "burgundy" and "glass," and also describe in the query "red" and "wine," the context of red, wine, glass, and burgundy occur together (and provide positive feedback as to relevancy of the result set), the system will extrapolate and learn from these words in context and can connect the semantic concepts together. As such, the probability that the queries relate to "wine glass," or "red wine glass" may be very high. As another example, if a Russian user queries that resulted in positive user feedback describes "dress" and "burgundy," the probability is higher that the query is about a burgundy colored dress than that the query relates to wine, or to the Burgundy region of France. There may be other clues in the query, such as describing "red" along with "burgundy" and "dress" so that the system will learn, that, in Russian the query is more likely to be about a red dress than about red wine or about the Burgundy region of France. Here the system may learn that "red" and "burgundy" used in the context of "dress" implies that red and burgundy are similar colors. This learning may be from extrapolating from a significant amount of data, such as user sessions, given that large ecommerce sites like eBay host millions of user sessions in one day. For smaller ecommerce sites, the system may have to wait until a statistically significant amount of data can be gathered from user sessions. [ΘΘ51] FIG. 4 is a flowchart illustrating an example method 400, consistent with various embodiments. At 410 of FIG. 4 a user may enter a query in a first language, here Russian, as at 302 of FIG. 3. Russian to English translation module 236 of FIG. 2A may then translate the query into a second language, here English, at 420 of FIG. 4. The ecommerce system may then query an ecommerce database at 430, the database being maintained in the English language. The ecommerce system may obtain result sets from the database query, as at 440 of FIG. 4. This result set is obtained from database 314 of FIG. 3 and at 450 of FIG. 5 the MT system may translate the result set into the first language, here Russian. This translation may be performed by English to Russian translation module 238 of FIG. 2A. At 460 of FIG. 4 the system may send the results set to the user in the first language, here Russian, as seen at 324 in FIG. 3. At 470 of FIG. 4, the user may provide feedback based on the result set, as discussed with respect to transmission of implicit user feedback over line 326 of FIG. 3. At 480 of FIG. 4, the system may monitor the user feedback and builds an ontology based on a query context and the user feedback, as explained with respect to ontology build application 328 of FIG. 3. This monitoring may be undertaken by user feedback monitoring module 242 of the ontology build application 240 of FIG. 2A. Positive user feedback may be evaluated by the query context learning module 244 that, then learns semantic relationships between keywords in the query, as more fully described at 328 of FIG. 3. Using the user feedback and the query contexts, the ontology build application may build the ontology and the translation optimizing module 246 may optimize the process of translation from the first language, here Russian, to the second language, here English, using the ontology as more fully discussed with respect to ontology build 328 of FIG. 3. [ΘΘ52] The foregoing may, in some embodiments discussed, comprise using a metric to generate automated scores without human intervention, such as having a human in the loop. The system can also be designed to include the user in the loop providing feedback, such that the system learns from that feedback. A large ecommerce system such as eBay has millions of users every day. Instead of, or in addition to, assuming or estimating how good the quality of MT is using automated scores as discussed above, the system can be designed to measure user feedback to determine how good the result set was to the user, and to act on that information to optimize MT. [0053] One method would be to use explicit user feedback such as providing for a star rating from user, with star ratings from one (1) star to five (5) stars where 1 star may indicate that the result set was not helpful and 5 stars may indicate that the result set was very helpful. Again, the objective is not primarily to learn whether the readability of the translation from Russian to English was helpful, but rather whether the result set obtained from that translation was helpful or not, and then use that information about helpful or not helpful to optimize translation. [ΘΘ54] A second method would be to use implicit user feedback by determining user action after the user is presented with the result set. One such action might be that the user accesses the ecommerce site and searches for a. product in the result set that was provided. Such a user interaction can be detected and determined to be positive feedback. An even better positive feedback action would be that the purchaser buys a product from the result set. Again, the purchase operation at the client machine can be detected and used as positive feedback. Purchasing a product from the result set is one of the strongest of user feedback information because it implies that the user received what the user was seeking, and the translation that led to the result set was among the optimum translations. Purchase feedback may then function to enforce the translation that was helpful to the user in acquiring the desired product. Other user transactions after receiving the result set may also indicate a positive value of the translation that led to the result set. For example, a user setting a watch for a product from the result set, or placing a bid for a product from the result set may also indicate that the user obtained what the user desired, which is the goal of MT for ecommerce. The MT system, being based on machine learning, does not provide certainty that a query translation is correct. Correctness of a quer translation is based on probability. The system may be designed to increase the probability that a translation is correct if the result sets obtained from the query translation leads to positive user feedback. On the other hand, the machine translation of the, here Russian, query could lead to a negative action. For example, if the user ended the transaction after receiving a result set, that action may be negative user feedback and the MT system could be designed to decrease the probability that a query translation is correct if negative user feedback is received. As one example, MT may translate "burgundy" into "red," with a 60 percent probability that the translation is correct. If that translation provides a result set that evokes positive feedback from the user, e.g., the user bought a product from the result set, the probability that burgundy translating to red is a correct translation can be increased a certain amount, perhaps to 65 percent, so that that translation can be made in another instance with an increased probability of being correct. In one embodiment, the setup for this translation may depend on how many users that were using the system were using the type of clue used to translate "burgundy" to "red." Such clues could include words of translation, grammar generated by the user in the query, and the like. The system may be designed to be cognizant of what clues were used in the translation. If the system recognizes that certain clues which fired led to a positive experience, the system may increase the value of those clues in the translation. As only one example of increasing the value of clues, if the translating of "burgundy" to "red" leads to a positive experience the system adapts by increasing the probability of that translation being correct. If the user cancels the transaction after receiving the result set from the translation of "burgundy" to "red," the probability that that translation is correct decreases, and next time those burgundy, red clues are encountered the system may try to find a better translation. So the user feedback, either positive or negative, may be viewed as clues that may be used by the system to increase or decrease the probability of the translation, "burgundy" to "red" being correct. This process continues in an iterative process of machine learning, with the ecommerce system such as eBay monitoring a massive number of user sessions in nearly real time, 10055] In one embodiment, the ontology is formed as data representing probabilities for keyword translations in different contexts in queries. For example, the keyword "burgundy" can be stored with alternative translations with associated probabilities for the each context: a first and second translation for the context with the keyword "dress" in the query having a respective first and second probability, and a first and second translation for the context with the keyword "glass" in the query having a respective first and second probability. The translations for the keyword can be the same or different for different contexts and the probabilities for the keyword for different contexts are unrelated. The number of alternate translations for each keyword can also be different: some keyword may have only a couple of alternative translations for a context, whereas other keywords may have many alternative translations and associate probabilities. [0056] The ontology is used by the machine translation application 234 to determine a translation for keywords in a query as the translations for the keywords having the highest probability in the stored data. The machine translation application 234 processes the query to remove non-content bearing words such as "a", "the" and "and". The remaining words are selected as keywords and the semantic relationship of the keywords in the query is determined as the context information. The determined keywords and their context can then be compared with the stored data representing keywords and their context to identify possible translations together with their associated probabilities. The translated words with the highest probabilities are selected as the translation of the query and used as the query to the ecommerce database in the second language to obtain a result set. [0057] The translation optimizing module 246 uses feedback from the user in response to a result set to adjust the probabilities for the translations of the keywords in the query generating the results set. Positive feedback is used to increases the probabilities for the translations of the keywords in the query. Negative feedback is used to reduce the probabilities for the translations of the keywords in the query, in this way, the translations of keywords resulting in the most useful results sets have their probabilities increased and are hence selected by the machine translation application for future translation of keywords in context in queries. [0058] The above processes are not mutually exclusive. They comprise two threads and two different statistical models, here explicit feedback with a human in the loop providing feedback, and implicit or automatic feedback evaluation. MT uses multiple knowledge sources, such as the two processes described above, at the same time and evaluates each of those knowledge sources to arrive at an optimum translation. Yet another process may be to determine from the user query the product to which the user query relates, and then go onto the Internet and access information from the product vendors. For example, if the Russian query is seen to be an iPhone, the system may go to the Apple™ web site. Vendor websites are often maintained in multiple languages, so accessing an Apple website that is maintained in Russian, in the present embodiment, may provide information about the product in the Russian language and the MT can learn from that information, and use it in the translation process. [0059] An example of the foregoing may be seen in FIG. 5 A, which is a flowchart illustrating an example method in accordance with the above embodiment. At 510 the system evaluates human feedback relating to the result set. The feedback may be positive feedback such as purchasing a product that is included in the result set. Or the feedback may be negative feedback such as terminating the transaction. At 515 the system determines whether the feedback is explicit. If YES, the system evaluates the explicit feedback at 530. If NO, the system assumes the feedback is implicit and evaluates the implicit feedback at 525, As part of the evaluation process the feedback, whether it is explicit and implicit or just implicit, is evaluated at 520 to determine whether the overall feedback is positive. If the feedback is positive then at 540 the probability that, the translation is correct is increased for translation optimization. If the feedback is not positive, it is assumed to be negative and at 535 the system decreases the probability that the translation is correct for translation optimization. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that a test may easily be designed to determine whether the feedback is neutral, such as a 3 star rating in explicit feedback as only one example. If the feedback is neutral the probability may be left unchanged. If the feedback is positive, then at 545 the system determines whether a new clue is recognized in the query. If a clue is recognized then at 550 the system may add the term of the recognized clue into the translation system. [0060] Another example of the foregoing may be seen in FIG. 5B, which is a flowchart illustrating an example method in accordance with the above embodiment. At 555 the system determines the identity of the product in the query that is in the first language, in one embodiment, Russian. At 560 the system accesses the product vendor website that is maintained in the query language. At 565 the system detects information that is in the query language and that relates to the product, from the vendor website that is maintained in the language of the query. At 570 the system uses the information in the query language that is obtained from the vendor website for the translation process. EXAMPLE MOBILE DEVICE [0061] FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating a mobile device 500, according to an example embodiment. The mobile device 500 may include a processor 502. The processor 502 may be any of a variety of different types of commercially available processors suitable for mobile devices (for example, an XScale architecture microprocessor, a microprocessor without interlocked pipeline stages (MIPS) architecture processor, or another type of processor 502). A memory 504, such as a random access memory (RAM), a flash memory, or other type of memory, is typically accessible to the processor 502. The memory 504 may be adapted to store an operating system (OS) 506, as well as application programs 508, such as a mobile location enabled application that may provide LBSs to a user. The processor 502 may be coupled, either directly or via appropriate intermediary hardware, to a display 510 and to one or more input/output (TO) devices 512, such as a keypad, a touch panel sensor, a microphone, and the like. Similarly, in some embodiments, the processor 502 may be coupled to a transceiver 514 that interfaces with an antenna 51 6. The transceiver 514 may be configured to both transmit and receive cellular network signals, wireless data signals, or other types of signals via the antenna 516, depending on the nature of the mobile device 500. Further, in some configurations, a GPS receiver 518 may also make use of the antenna 516 to receive GPS signals. MODULES, COMPONENTS AND LOGIC [0062] Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components, modules, or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code embodied (1 ) on machine-readable storage or (2) in a transmission signal) or hardware-implemented modules. A hardware- implemented module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more processors 502 may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware-implemented module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein, 10063] In various embodiments, a hardware-implemented module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware- implemented module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special- purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware-implemented module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) thai is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware-implemented module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations. [0064] Accordingly, the term "hardware-implemented module" should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired) or temporarily or transitorily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner and/or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware-implemented modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware-implemented modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware-implemented modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware-implemented modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure processor 502, for example, to constitute a particular hardware-implemented module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware-implemented module at a different instance of time. [0065] Hardware- implemented modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware-implemented modules. Accordingly, the described hardware -implemented modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware-implemented modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses that connect the hardware-implemented modules). In embodiments in which multiple hardware- implemented modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware-implemented modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware-implemented modules have access. For example, one hardware-implemented module may perform an operation, and store the output of that operation in a memoiy device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware-implemented module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware-implemented modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information). [ΘΘ66] The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors 502 that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors 502 may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules. [ΘΘ67] Similarly, the methods described herein may be at least partially processor- implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors 502 or processor- implemented modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors 502, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processor 502 or processors 502 may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors 502 may be distributed across a number of locations. 1Δ [0068] The one or more processors 502 may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a "cloud computing" environment or as a "software as a service" (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., application program interfaces (APIs).) ELECTRONIC APPARATUS AND SYSTEM [ΘΘ69] Example embodiments may be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them. Example embodiments may be implemented using a computer program product, e.g., a computer program tangibly embodied in an information carrier, e.g., in a machine-readable medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus, e.g., a. programmable processor 502, a computer, or multiple computers. [ΘΘ70] computer program can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment. A computer program can be deployed to be executed on one computer or on multiple computers at one site or distributed across multiple sites and interconnected by a communication network. [ΘΘ71] In example embodiments, operations may be performed by one or more programmable processors 502 executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Method operations can also be performed by, and apparatus of example embodiments may be implemented as, special purpose logic circuitry, e.g., a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). [0072] The computing system can include clients and servers. A client and server are generally remote from each other and typically interact through a communication network. The relationship of client and server arises by virtue of computer programs running on the respective computers and having a client- server relationship to each other. In embodiments deploying a programmable computing system, it will be appreciated that that both hardware and software architectures merit consideration. Specifically, it will be appreciated that the choice of whether to implement certain functionality in permanently configured hardware (e.g., an ASIC), in temporarily configured hardware (e.g., a combination of software and a programmable processor 502), or a combination of permanently and temporarily configured hardware may be a design choice. Below are set out hardware (e.g., machine) and software architectures that may be deployed, in various example embodiments, EXAMPLE MACHINE ARCHITECTURE AMD MACHINE-READABLE MEDIUM [0073] FIG. 7 is a block diagram of machine in the example form of a computer system 600 within which instructions 624 may be executed for causing the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies discussed herein.

MACHINE-READABLE MEDIUM [0075] The disk drive unit 616 includes a computer-readable medium 622, which may be hardware storage, on which is stored one or more sets of data structures and instructions 624 (e.g., software) embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The instructions 624 may also reside, completely or at least partially, within the main memory 604 and/or within the processor 602 during execution thereof by the computer system 600, the main memory 604 and the processor 602 also constituting computer-readable media 622. [0076] While the computer-readable medium 622. is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium, the term "computer-readable medium" may include a single medium or multiple media (e.g., a centralized or distributed database, and/or associated caches and servers) that store or carry the one or more instructions 624 or data structures. The term "computer-readable medium" shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying instructions 624 for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present disclosure or that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with such instructions 624. The term "computer-readable medium" shall accordingly be taken to include, but not be limited to, solid-state memories, and optical and magnetic media. Specific examples of computer-readable media 622 include non-volatile memory, including by way of example semiconductor memory devices, e.g., erasable programmable read-only memory (EPR.OM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and flash memory devices; magnetic disks such as internal hard disks and removable disks; magneto-optical disks; and CD-ROM and DVD-ROM disks. TRANSMISSION MEDIUM [ΘΘ77] The instructions 624 may further be transmitted or received over a communications network 626 using a transmission medium (a transient computer readable medium). The instructions 624 may be transmitted using the network interface device 620 and any one of a number of well-known transfer protocols (e.g., HTTP). Examples of communication networks include a local area network ("LAN"), a wide area network ("WAN"), the Internet, mobile telephone networks, plain old telephone (POTS) networks, and wireless data networks (e.g., WiFi and WiMax networks). The term "transmission medium" shall be taken to include any intangible medium that is capable of storing, encoding or carrying instructions 724 for execution by the machine, and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible media to facilitate communication of such software.
