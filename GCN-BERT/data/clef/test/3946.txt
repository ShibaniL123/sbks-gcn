The entirety of each of these applications is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes. BACKGROUND [0002] The complement system is a part of the innate immune system which does not adapt to changes over the course of the host's life, but is recruited and used by the adaptive immune system. For example, it assists, or complements, the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear pathogens. This sophisticated regulatory pathway allows rapid reaction to pathogenic organisms while protecting host cells from destruction. Over thirty proteins and protein fragments make up the complement system. These proteins act through opsonization (enhancing phaogytosis of antigens), chemotaxis (attracting macrophages and neutrophils), cell lysis (rupturing membranes of foreign cells) and agglutination (clustering and binding of pathogens together). [0003] The complement system has three pathways: classical, alternative and lectin. Complement factor D plays an early and central role in activation of the alternative pathway of the complement cascade. Activation of the alternative complement pathway is initiated by spontaneous hydrolysis of a thioester bond within C3 to produce C3(H20), which associates with factor B to form the C3(H20)B complex. Complement factor D acts to cleave factor B within the C3(H20)B complex to form Ba and Bb. The Bb fragment remains associated with C3(H20) to form the alternative pathway C3 convertase C3(H20)Bb. Additionally, C3b generated by any of the C3 convertases also associates with factor B to form C3bB, which factor D cleaves to generate the later stage alternative pathway C3 convertase C3bBb. This latter form of the alternative pathway C3 convertase may provide important downstream amplification within all three of the defined complement pathways, leading ultimately to the recruitment and assembly of additional factors in the complement cascade pathway, including the cleavage of C5 to C5a and C5b. C5b acts in the assembly of factors C6, C7, C8, and C9 into the membrane attack complex, which can destroy pathogenic cells by lysing the cell. [0004] The dysfunction of or excessive activation of complement has been linked to certain autoimmune, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as ischemia- reperfusion injury and cancer. For example, activation of the alternative pathway of the complement cascade contributes to the production of C3a and C5a, both potent anaphylatoxins, which also have roles in a number of inflammatory disorders. Therefore, in some instances, it is desirable to decrease the response of the complement pathway, including the alternative complement pathway. Some examples of disorders mediated by the complement pathway include age-related macular degeneration (AMD), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. [0005] Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss in industrialized countries. Based on a number of genetic studies, there is evidence of the link between the complement cascade and macular degeneration. Individuals with mutations in the gene encoding complement factor H have a fivefold increased risk of macular degeneration and individuals with mutations in other complement factor genes also have an increased risk of AMD. Individuals with mutant factor H also have increased levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. Without adequate functioning factor H, the alternative pathway of the complement cascade is overly activated leading to cellular damage. Inhibition of the alternative pathway is thus desired. [0006] Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a non-malignant, hematological disorder characterized by the expansion of hematopoietic stem cells and progeny mature blood cells which are deficient in some surface proteins. PNH erythrocytes are not capable of modulating their surface complement activation, which leads to the typical hallmark of PNH - the chronic activation of complement mediated intravascular anemia. Currently, only one product, the anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab, has been approved in the U.S. for treatment of PNH. However, many of the patients treated with eculizumab remain anemic, and many patients continue to require blood transfusions. In addition, treatment with eculizumab requires life-long intravenous injections. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop novel inhibitors of the complement pathway. [0007] Factor D is an attractive target for inhibition or regulation of the complement cascade due to its early and essential role in the alternative complement pathway, and its potential role in signal amplification within the classical and lectin complement pathways. Inhibition of factor D effectively interrupts the pathway and attenuates the formation of the membrane attack complex. [0008] While initial attempts have been made to develop inhibitors of factor D, there are currently no small molecule factor D inhibitors in clinical trials. Examples of factor D inhibitors or prolyl compounds are described in the following disclosures. [0009] Biocryst Pharmaceuticals US Pat.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION I. TERMINOLOGY [0072] Compounds are described using standard nomenclature. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs. [0073] The compounds in any of the Formulas described herein include enantiomers, mixtures of enantiomers, diastereomers, tautomers, racemates and other isomers, such as rotamers, as if each is specifically described. "Formula I" includes all subgeneric groups of Formula I, such as Formula IA and Formula IB and also includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts of a compound of Formula I, unless clearly contraindicated by the context in which this phrase is used. "Formula I" also includes all subgeneric groups of Formula I, such as Formulas IC - ID, and Formulas II - XXX, and also includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts of all subgeneric groups of Formula I, such as Formulas IA - ID, and Formulas II - XXX, unless contraindicated by the context in which this phrase is used. [0074] The terms "a" and "an" do not denote a limitation of quantity, but rather denote the presence of at least one of the referenced item. The term "or" means "and/or". Recitation of ranges of values are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range, unless otherwise indicated herein, and each separate value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. The endpoints of all ranges are included within the range and independently combinable. All methods described herein can be performed in a suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of examples, or exemplary language (e.g., "such as"), is intended merely to better illustrate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention unless otherwise claimed. Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs. [0075] The present invention includes compounds of Formula I and the use of compounds with at least one desired isotopic substitution of an atom, at an amount above the natural abundance of the isotope, i.e., enriched. Isotopes are atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers, i.e., the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. [0076] Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, UC, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18F 31P, 32P, 35S, 36CI, 125I respectively. The invention includes isotopically modified compounds of Formula I. In one embodiment, isotopically labelled compounds can be used in metabolic studies (with 14C), reaction kinetic studies (with, for example 2H or 3H), detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an 18F labeled compound may be particularly desirable for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. [0077] By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen, for example, deuterium (2H) and tritium (3H) may be used anywhere in described structures that achieves the desired result. Alternatively or in addition, isotopes of carbon, e.g., 13C and 14C, may be used. In one embodiment, the isotopic substitution is deuterium for hydrogen at one or more locations on the molecule to improve the performance of the drug, for example, the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, half-life, stability, AUC, Tmax, Cmax, etc. For example, the deuterium can be bound to carbon in a location of bond breakage during metabolism (an a-deuterium kinetic isotope effect) or next to or near the site of bond breakage (a Î²-deuterium kinetic isotope effect). [0078] Isotopic substitutions, for example deuterium substitutions, can be partial or complete. Partial deuterium substitution means that at least one hydrogen is substituted with deuterium. In certain embodiments, the isotope is 90, 95 or 99% or more enriched in an isotope at any location of interest. In one embodiments deuterium is 90, 95 or 99% enriched at a desired location. Unless otherwise stated, the enrichment at any point is above natural abundance and enough to alter a detectable property of the drug in a human. [0079] In one embodiment, the substitution of a hydrogen atom for a deuterium atom occurs within an R group substituent on the L-B moiety region. In one embodiment, the substitution of a hydrogen atom for a deuterium atom occurs within an R group selected from any of R 18 , R 18' , R 33 , R 34 , R 35 , and/or R 36. In one embodiment, the substitution of a hydrogen atom for a deuterium atom occurs within an R group substituent within the A-carbonyl moiety region. In one embodiment, the substitution of a hydrogen atom for a deuterium atom occurs at R4< R5, R6, R6 , R7, R8, R8', R11, R12, R13, R14, R15, R16, R19, R20, R20a, R20b, R21, R22, R23, R31, and R32. In other embodiments, certain substituents on the proline ring are selectively deuterated. For example, in one embodiment, the substitution of a hydrogen atom for a deuterium atom ' 1 1 ' 2 2' 3 3' occurs at R, R , R , R , R , R , R , and/or R . In one embodiment, for example, when any of the R substituents of the proline ring are methyl or methoxy, the alkyl residue is optionally deuterated, e.g., CD3 or OCD3. In certain other embodiments, when two substituents of the proline ring are combined to form a cyclopropyl ring, the unsubstituted methylene carbon is deuterated. [0080] The substitution of a hydrogen atom for a deuterium atom occurs within an R group when at least one of the variables within the R group is hydrogen (e.g., 2H or D) or alkyl (e.g., CD3). For example, when any of R groups are, or contain for example through substitution, methyl or ethyl, the alkyl residue is typically deuterated, e.g., CD3i CH2CD3 or CD2CD3. [0081] The compound of the present invention may form a solvate with solvents (including water). Therefore, in one embodiment, the invention includes a solvated form of the active compound. The term "solvate" refers to a molecular complex of a compound of the present invention (including salts thereof) with one or more solvent molecules. Examples of solvents are water, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetone and other common organic solvents. The term "hydrate" refers to a molecular complex comprising a compound of the invention and water. Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D20, d6-acetone, d6-DMSO. A solvate can be in a liquid or solid form. [0082] A dash ("-") that is not between two letters or symbols is used to indicate a point of attachment for a substituent. For example, -(C=0)NH2 is attached through carbon of the keto (C=0) group. [0083] The term "substituted", as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the designated atom or group is replaced with a moiety selected from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valence is not exceeded. For example, when the substituent is oxo (i.e., =0) then two hydrogens on the atom are replaced. When an oxo group replaces two hydrogens in an aromatic moiety, the corresponding partially unsaturated ring replaces the aromatic ring. For example a pyridyl group substituted by oxo is a pyridone. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds or useful synthetic intermediates. [0084] A stable compound or stable structure refers to a compound leading to a compound that can be isolated and can be formulated into a dosage form with a shelf life of at least one month. [0085] Any suitable group may be present on a "substituted" or "optionally substituted" position that forms a stable molecule and advances the desired purpose of the invention and includes, but is not limited to, e.g., halogen (which can independently be F, CI, Br or I); cyano; hydroxyl; nitro; azido; alkanoyl (such as a C2-C6 alkanoyl group); carboxamide; alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, aryloxy such as phenoxy; alkylthio including those having one or more thioether linkages; alkylsulfmyl; alkylsulfonyl groups including those having one or more sulfonyl linkages; aminoalkyl groups including groups having one or more N atoms; aryl (e.g., phenyl, biphenyl, naphthyl, or the like, each ring either substituted or unsubstituted aromatic); arylalkyl having for example, 1 to 3 separate or fused rings and from 6 to about 14 or 18 ring carbon atoms, with benzyl being an exemplary arylalkyl group; arylalkoxy, for example, having 1 to 3 separate or fused rings with benzyloxy being an exemplary arylalkoxy group; or a saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic heterocyclic group having 1 to 3 separate or fused rings with one or more N, O or S atoms, e.g. coumarinyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, quinazolinyl, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, furanyl, pyrrolyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, triazinyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, imidazolyl, indolyl, benzofuranyl, benzothiazolyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydropyranyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, piperazinyl, and pyrrolidinyl.

[0112] "Pharmaceutically acceptable salts" includes derivatives of the disclosed compounds in which the parent compound is modified by making inorganic and organic, nontoxic, acid or base addition salts thereof. The salts of the present compounds can be synthesized from a parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting free acid forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base (such as Na, Ca, Mg, or K hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate, or the like), or by reacting free base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate acid. Such reactions are typically carried out in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two. Generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are typical, where practicable. Salts of the present compounds further include solvates of the compounds and of the compound salts. [0113] Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts and the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, conventional nontoxic acid salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, mesylic, esylic, besylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH where n is 0-4, and the like. Lists of additional suitable salts may be found, e.g., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., p. 1418 (1985).

[0115] A "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" means an excipient that is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition/combination that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise inappropriate for administration to a host, and includes, in one embodiment, an excipient that is acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. A "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" as used in the present application includes both one and more than one such excipient. [0116] A "patient" or "host" or "subject" is a human or non-human animal in need of modulation of the complement factor D pathway. Typically the host is a human. A "patient" or "host" or "subject" also refers to for example, mammals, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, mice, fish, birds and the like. [0117] A "prodrug" as used herein, means a compound which when administered to a host in vivo is converted into a parent drug. As used herein, the term "parent drug" means any of the presently described chemical compounds that are useful to treat any of the disorders described herein, or to control or improve the underlying cause or symptoms associated with any physiological or pathological disorder described herein in a host, typically a human. Prodrugs can be used to achieve any desired effect, including to enhance properties of the parent drug or to improve the pharmaceutic or pharmacokinetic properties of the parent. Prodrug strategies exist which provide choices in modulating the conditions for in vivo generation of the parent drug, all of which are deemed included herein. Nonlimiting examples of prodrug strategies include covalent attachment of removable groups, or removable portions of groups, for example, but not limited to acylation, phosphorylation, phosphonylation, phosphoramidate derivatives, amidation, reduction, oxidation, esterification, alkylation, other carboxy derivatives, sulfoxy or sulfone derivatives, carbonylation or anhydride, among others. [0118] "Providing a compound of Formula I with at least one additional active agent" means the compound of Formula I and the additional active agent(s) are provided simultaneously in a single dosage form, provided concomitantly in separate dosage forms, or provided in separate dosage forms for administration separated by some amount of time that is within the time in which both the compound of Formula I and the at least one additional active agent are within the blood stream of a patient. In certain embodiments the compound of Formula I and the additional active agent need not be prescribed for a patient by the same medical care worker. In certain embodiments the additional active agent or agents need not require a prescription. Administration of the compound of Formula I or the at least one additional active agent can occur via any appropriate route, for example, oral tablets, oral capsules, oral liquids, inhalation, injection, suppositories or topical contact. [0119] A "therapeutically effective amount" of a pharmaceutical composition/combination of this invention means an amount effective, when administered to a patient, to provide a therapeutic benefit such as an amelioration of symptoms, e.g., an amount effective to decrease the symptoms of a macular degeneration. In one embodiment, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount sufficient to prevent a significant increase or will significantly reduce the detectable level of complement factor D in the patient's blood, serum, or tissues.

[0392] TABLE 1 EXAMPLE 25. HUMAN FACTOR D ASSAY [0393] Human factor D (purified from human serum, Complement Technology, Inc.) at 80 nM final concentration is incubated with test compound at various concentrations for 5 minutes at room temperature in 50 mM Tris, 1M NaCl, pH 7.5. A synthetic substrate Z-L-Lys- SBzl and DTNB (Ellman's reagent) are added to final concentrations of 100 Î¼Î each. The increase in color is recorded at OD405 nm in a microplate in kinetic mode over 30 minutes with 30 second time points in a spectra fluorimeter. IC50 values are calculated by non- linear regression from the percentage of inhibition of complement factor D activity as a function of test compound concentration. EXAMPLE 26. HEMOLYSIS ASSAY [0394] The hemolysis assay was previously described by G. Ruiz-Gomez, et al, J. Med. Chem. (2009) 52: 6042-6052. In the assay red blood cells (RBC), rabbit erythrocytes (purchased from Complement Technologies), are washed using GVB Buffer (0.1 % gelatin, 5 mM Veronal, 145 mM NaCl, 0.025 % NaN3, pH 7.3) plus 10 mM final Mg-EGTA. Cells are used at a concentration of 1 x 108 cells/mL. Prior to the hemolysis assay, the optimum concentration of Normal Human Serum (NHS) needed to achieve 100% lysis of rabbit erythrocytes is determined by titration. NHS (Complement Technologies) is incubated with inhibitor for 15 min at 37 Â°C, rabbit erythrocytes in buffer were added and incubated for an additional 30 min at 37 Â°C. Positive control (100% lysis) consists of serum and RBC and negative control (0% lysis) of Mg-EGTA buffer and RBC only. Samples are centrifuged at 2000g for 5 min, and supernatants collected. Optical density of the supernatant is monitored at 405 nm using a UV/visible spectrophotometer. Percentage lysis in each sample is calculated relative to positive control (100% lysis). Part B.

TERMINOLOGY OF PRIORITY DOCUMENT [0454] Compounds are described using standard nomenclature. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Unless clearly contraindicated by the context each compound name includes the free acid or free base form of the compound as well as all pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound. [0455] The term "Formula I" encompasses all compounds that satisfy Formula I, including any enantiomers, racemates and stereoisomers, as well as all pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds. "Formula I" includes all subgeneric groups of Formula I, such as Formula IA and Formula IB and also includes pharmaceutically acceptable salts of a compound of Formula I, unless clearly contraindicated by the context in which this phrase is used. [0456] The terms "a" and "an" do not denote a limitation of quantity, but rather denote the presence of at least one of the referenced item. The term "or" means "and/or". The open- ended transitional phrase "comprising" encompasses the intermediate transitional phrase "consisting essentially of and the close-ended phrase "consisting of." Claims reciting one of these three transitional phrases, or with an alternate transitional phrase such as "containing" or "including" can be written with any other transitional phrase unless clearly precluded by the context or art. Recitation of ranges of values are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range, unless otherwise indicated herein, and each separate value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. The endpoints of all ranges are included within the range and independently combinable. All methods described herein can be performed in a suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language (e.g., "such as"), is intended merely to better illustrate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention unless otherwise claimed. No language in the specification should be construed as indicating any non-claimed element as essential to the practice of the invention as used herein. Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this invention belongs. [0457] Compounds of Formula I include all compounds of Formula I having isotopic substitutions at any position. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example, and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium and isotopes of carbon include UC, 13C, and 14C. While the compounds of Formula I require a moderate or high level of deuteration (substitution of a hydrogen with deuterium) at identified positions, Formula I includes embodiments in which other positions are isotopically enriched. [0458] An "active agent" means a compound (including a compound disclosed herein), element, or mixture that when administered to a patient, alone or in combination with another compound, element, or mixture, confers, directly or indirectly, a physiological effect on the patient. The indirect physiological effect may occur via a metabolite or other indirect mechanism.

Such substitution may include fusion to a 5 to 7-membered saturated cyclic group that optionally contains 1 or 2 heteroatoms independently chosen from N, O, and S, to form, for example, a 3,4-methylenedioxy-phenyl group. Aryl groups include, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, including 1- naphthyl and 2- naphthyl, and bi-phenyl. [0478] A "Heterocyclic ring" is a saturated, unsaturated, or partially unsaturated (e.g. aromatic) ring containing 1 to 4 ring heteroatoms independently chosen from N, O, and S, or if indicated, N, O, S, and B, with remaining ring atoms being carbon. A" heterocyclic group" may contain 1 heterocyclic ring 1 ring of 3 to 7 ring atoms or 2 fused rings each containing 3 to 7 ring atoms with at least one ring being a heterocyclic ring. [0479] "Heterocyclicoxy group"is a monocyclic heterocyclic ring or a bicyclic heterocyclic group as described previously linked to the group it substitutes via an oxygen, -0-, linker.

In some embodiments bicyclic heteroaryl groups are 9- to 10-membered heteroaryl groups, that is, groups containing 9 or 10 ring atoms in which one 5- to 7-member aromatic ring is fused to a second aromatic or non-aromatic ring. When the total number of S and O atoms in the heteroaryl group exceeds 1, these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. It is preferred that the total number of S and O atoms in the heteroaryl group is not more than 2. It is particularly preferred that the total number of S and O atoms in the aromatic heterocycle is not more than 1. Examples of heteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to, oxazolyl, pyranyl, pyrazinyl, pyrazolopyrimidinyl, pyrazolyl, pyridizinyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolyl, quinolinyl, tetrazolyl, thiazolyl, thienylpyrazolyl, thiophenyl, triazolyl, benzo[<i]oxazolyl, benzofuranyl, benzothiazolyl, benzothiophenyl, benzoxadiazolyl, dihydrobenzodioxynyl, furanyl, imidazolyl, indolyl, and isoxazolyl.

[0482] The term "mono- and/ or di-alkylamino" indicates secondary or tertiary alkyl amino groups, wherein the alkyl groups are independently chosen alkyl groups, as defined herein, having the indicated number of carbon atoms. The point of attachment of the alkylamino group is on the nitrogen. Examples of mono- and di-alkylamino groups include ethylamino, dimethylamino, and methyl-propyl-amino. [0483] The term "substituted", as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the designated atom or group is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valence is not exceeded. When the substituent is oxo (i.e., =0) then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. When an oxo group substitutes aromatic moieties, the corresponding partially unsaturated ring replaces the aromatic ring. For example a pyridyl group substituted by oxo is a pyridone. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds or useful synthetic intermediates. A stable compound or stable structure is meant to imply a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation from a reaction mixture, and subsequent formulation into an effective therapeutic agent. Unless otherwise specified substituents are named into the core structure. For example, it is to be understood that when aminoalkyl is listed as a possible substituent the point of attachment of this substituent to the core structure is in the alkyl portion.

[0486] "Pharmaceutical compositions" are compositions comprising at least one active agent, such as a compound or salt of Formula I, and at least one other substance, such as a carrier. Pharmaceutical compositions optional contain one or more additional active agents. When specified, pharmaceutical compositions meet the U.S. FDA's GMP (good manufacturing practice) standards for human or non-human drugs. "Pharmaceutical combinations" are combinations of at least two active agents which may be combined in a single dosage form or provided together in separate dosage forms with instructions that the active agents are to be used together to treat a disorder, such as hepatitis C. [0487] "Pharmaceutically acceptable salts" includes derivatives of the disclosed compounds in which the parent compound is modified by making inorganic and organic, nontoxic, acid or base addition salts thereof. The salts of the present compounds can be synthesized from a parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting free acid forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base (such as Na, Ca, Mg, or K hydroxide, carbonate, bicarbonate, or the like), or by reacting free base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate acid. Such reactions are typically carried out in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two. Generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred, where practicable. Salts of the present compounds further include solvates of the compounds and of the compound salts. [0488] Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts and the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, conventional nontoxic acid salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, mesylic, esylic, besylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH where n is 0-4, and the like. Lists of additional suitable salts may be found, e.g., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., p. 1418 (1985). [0489] The term "carrier" applied to pharmaceutical compositions/ combinations of the invention refers to a diluent, excipient, or vehicle with which an active compound is provided. [0490] A "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" means an excipient that is useful in preparing a pharmaceutical composition/ combination that is generally safe, non-toxic and neither biologically nor otherwise undesirable, and includes an excipient that is acceptable for veterinary use as well as human pharmaceutical use. A "pharmaceutically acceptable excipient" as used in the present application includes both one and more than one such excipient. [0491] A "patient" is a human or non-human animal in need of medical treatment. Medical treatment can include treatment of an existing condition, such as a disease or disorder, prophylactic or preventative treatment, or diagnostic treatment. In some embodiments the patient is a human patient. [0492] "Providing" means giving, administering, selling, distributing, transferring (for profit or not), manufacturing, compounding, or dispensing. [0493] "Providing a compound of Formula I with at least one additional active agent" means the compound of Formula I and the additional active agent(s) are provided simultaneously in a single dosage form, provided concomitantly in separate dosage forms, or provided in separate dosage forms for administration separated by some amount of time that is within the time in which both the compound of Formula I and the at least one additional active agent are within the blood stream of a patient. In certain embodiments the compound of Formula I and the additional active agent need not be prescribed for a patient by the same medical care worker. In certain embodiments the additional active agent or agents need not require a prescription. Administration of the compound of Formula I or the at least one additional active agent can occur via any appropriate route, for example, oral tablets, oral capsules, oral liquids, inhalation, injection, suppositories or topical contact. [0494] "Treatment," as used herein includes providing a compound of Formula I, either as the only active agent or together with at least one additional active agent sufficient to: (a) prevent a disease or a symptom of a disease from occurring in a patient who may be predisposed to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it (e.g. including diseases that may be associated with or caused by a primary disease (as in macular degeneration that can result in the context of factor D activation); (b) inhibiting the disease, i.e. arresting its development; and (c) relieving the disease, i.e., causing regression of the disease. "Treating" and "treatment" also means providing a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I, as the only active agent or together with at least one additional active agent to a patient having or susceptible to a condition mediated by complement factor D. [0495] A "therapeutically effective amount" of a pharmaceutical composition/ combination of this invention means an amount effective, when administered to a patient, to provide a therapeutic benefit such as an amelioration of symptoms, e.g., an amount effective to decrease the symptoms of a macular degeneration. A therapeutically effective amount is also an amount sufficient to prevent a significant increase or significantly reduce the detectable level of complement Factor D in the patient's blood, serum, or tissues.
