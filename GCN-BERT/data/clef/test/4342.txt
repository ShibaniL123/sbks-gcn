BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a dielectric and a method for producing the same, and an electrolytic capacitor. 2. Description of the Related Art An oxide containing a valve metal is mainly used for a dielectric forming the dielectric layer of an electrolytic capacitor. The oxide has valve action, has a high dielectric constant, and can achieve higher capacitance. Techniques related to dielectrics are disclosed in JP1-277342A, JP2010-34589A, JP43-18012B, JP6-333263A, JP9-165676A, JP2004-22702A, and JP2005-327428A. However, in the techniques described in the above patent literatures, the amount of leakage current is large, and particularly in a high temperature environment, there is a tendency that the increase fluctuation of capacitance increases, and the leakage current increases, and therefore, the reliability is low. It is an object of the present invention to provide a dielectric and an electrolytic capacitor that have a small amount of leakage current, and have high reliability also in a high temperature environment. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A dielectric according to the present invention is a dielectric containing at least zirconium, titanium, and a carbon atom, wherein a concentration of the carbon atom is 100 ppm or more and 10,000 ppm or less, and an atomic ratio of the titanium to a sum of the zirconium and the titanium is 30% or more and 90% or less. A method for producing a dielectric according to the present invention includes mixing an alloy of zirconium and titanium with an organic binder to obtain a mixture; sintering the mixture to obtain a sintered body; and anodizing the sintered body. A method for producing a dielectric according to the present invention includes heat-treating an alloy of zirconium and titanium in a gas containing organic compound A; and anodizing the alloy after the heat treatment. A method for producing a dielectric according to the present invention includes anodizing an alloy of zirconium and titanium in a solution containing organic compound B. An electrolytic capacitor according to the present invention includes the dielectric according to the present invention. The present invention can provide a dielectric and an electrolytic capacitor that have a small amount of leakage current, and have high reliability also in a high temperature environment. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Dielectric A dielectric according to the present invention is a dielectric containing at least zirconium (Zr), titanium (Ti), and carbon atoms (C), wherein the concentration of the carbon atoms is 100 ppm or more and 10,000 ppm or less, and the atomic ratio of the titanium to the sum of the zirconium and the titanium (Ti/(Zr+Ti)) is 30% or more and 90% or less. Ti has a relative dielectric constant exceeding those of Ta and Al, and therefore, its application to electrolytic capacitors is regarded as promising. However, an oxide that is a dielectric containing Ti is likely to crystallize, and therefore, a problem of the oxide is that the leakage current is likely to increase. Therefore, it is considered that a different element is added to Ti for alloying to suppress crystallization. However, for example, in a dielectric obtained using an alloy containing Ti and Zr, or Ti and Al, the leakage current is not sufficiently reduced, and the dielectric cannot be applied to an electrolytic capacitor. In addition, for the dielectric, in a high temperature environment, the increase fluctuation of capacitance increases, and the leakage current also increases because in a high temperature environment, oxygen atoms in the oxide that is the dielectric diffuse to the underlying valve metal side, and the effective thickness of the dielectric film decreases. The dielectric according to the present invention contains zirconium, titanium, and carbon atoms at a particular ratio. In the present invention, the carbon atoms added in a slight amount can suppress the crystallization of the dielectric and stabilize the amorphous structure. Thus, a dielectric having a small amount of leakage current can be obtained. In addition, also in a high temperature environment, the carbon atoms added in a slight amount inhibit the movement of oxygen, and therefore, an increase in the increase fluctuation of capacitance and an increase in leakage current can be suppressed, and a dielectric having high reliability can be obtained. In this manner, the dielectric according to the present invention is useful as a dielectric for an electrolytic capacitor. The concentration of carbon atoms in the dielectric according to the present invention is 100 ppm or more and 10,000 ppm or less. When the concentration of carbon atoms is less than 100 ppm, a sufficient crystallization suppression effect is not obtained, and the leakage current increases. On the other hand, when the concentration of carbon atoms exceeds 10,000 ppm, a carbide is formed to provide a dielectric having low insulating properties, and the leakage current increases. The concentration of carbon atoms is preferably 150 ppm or more and 8,000 ppm or less, more preferably 1,000 ppm or more and 7,000 ppm or less, and further preferably 2,000 ppm or more and 5,000 ppm or less. The measurement of the concentration of carbon atoms is carried out by a method described later. In addition, “ppm,” the unit of the concentration of carbon atoms, is a mass ratio. The atomic ratio of the titanium to the sum of the zirconium and the titanium included in the dielectric according to the present invention is 30% or more and 90% or less. When the atomic ratio is less than 30%, the dielectric is a crystalline oxide and is not an amorphous structure. On the other hand, when the atomic ratio exceeds 90%, the dielectric changes from the amorphous structure to the crystalline oxide at low anodization voltage when the dielectric is produced by anodization described later. The atomic ratio is preferably 33% or more and 70% or less, more preferably 35% or more and 60% or less, and further preferably 37% or more and 50% or less. The measurement of the atomic ratio is carried out by a method described later. The dielectric according to the present invention can be in a state in which carbon atoms are dissolved in an oxide containing zirconium and titanium. The state can be confirmed by XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and an EPMA (Electron probe micro analyzer). The dielectric according to the present invention preferably includes an amorphous structure. When the dielectric includes an amorphous structure, the leakage current decreases. The fact that the dielectric includes an amorphous structure can be confirmed by a transmission electron microscope. The dielectric according to the present invention may also contain a different element such as nitrogen atoms, fluorine atoms, or phosphorus atoms in addition to zirconium, titanium, and carbon atoms. Also when the dielectric contains the different element, the effects of the suppression of the crystallization of the dielectric and the inhibition of the diffusion of oxygen are obtained. The different element may be included in the dielectric at 10000 ppm or less and is preferably not included in the dielectric. The dielectric according to the present invention can contain oxygen atoms. [Methods for Producing Dielectrics] The dielectric according to the present invention can be preferably produced by embodiments shown below. The concentration of carbon atoms in each of dielectrics obtained by methods according to the embodiments shown below is 100 ppm or more and 10,000 ppm or less. In a dielectric oxide film containing carbon atoms at the above concentration, the carbon atoms present dissolved in the film stabilize the amorphous structure of the oxide, and therefore, the leakage current is reduced. Further, in a high temperature environment, the carbon atoms present dissolved inhibit the diffusion of oxygen atoms in the dielectric oxide film into a metal layer that is a substrate, and therefore, an electrolytic capacitor having high reliability in which an increase in the increase fluctuation of capacitance and an increase in leakage current are suppressed is obtained. Also when no raw material for carbon atoms is intentionally added during dielectric fabrication, carbon atoms may be included as an impurity in zirconium and titanium at less than 100 ppm. However, the amount of the carbon atoms included as an impurity is small, and therefore, the concentration of carbon atoms in the dielectric is not 100 ppm or more unless a raw material for carbon atoms is intentionally added during dielectric fabrication. In addition, the atomic ratio of titanium to the sum of zirconium and titanium in each of the dielectrics obtained by the above methods is 30% or more and 90% or less. When the atomic ratio is within the above range, a dielectric oxide film formed by anodization is likely to be an amorphous structure and is less likely to be a crystalline oxide. On the other hand, when the atomic ratio is outside the above range, a sufficient crystallization suppression effect of carbon atoms is not obtained, and an amorphous structure is not provided even if the dielectric contains carbon atoms at a concentration within the above range. The dielectric according to the present invention is not limited to the dielectrics produced by the following embodiments. First Embodiment A method for producing a dielectric according to this embodiment includes mixing an alloy of zirconium and titanium with an organic binder to obtain a mixture; sintering the above mixture to obtain a sintered body; and anodizing the above sintered body.

These may be used singly or in combinations of two or more. Among these, acrylic resins are more preferred as the organic binder in terms of the strength of a pressure-press formed body. The organic binder contains carbon atoms and therefore is a raw material for the carbon atoms of the dielectric. For the mixing ratio of the above alloy to the above organic binder, when the amount of the above alloy is 100 parts by mass, the amount of the above organic binder is preferably 0.1 parts by mass or more and 40 parts by mass or less, more preferably 1 part by mass or more and 30 parts by mass or less, in terms of the suitable range of the amount of carbon atoms included in the dielectric.

The fact that the zirconium and the titanium are alloyed can be confirmed by an X-ray diffraction method. Next, the above mixture is sintered to obtain a sintered body (hereinafter also shown as a sintering step). In this step, most of the organic binder is gasified, but some carbon atoms in the organic binder react with the alloy of titanium and zirconium, and therefore, the alloy of titanium and zirconium containing a certain amount of carbon atoms is formed on the surface. In addition, when the above mixture is powdery, the obtained sintered body is porous.

When the press forming step is performed, the obtained press formed body is sintered by the above sintering step to obtain a sintered body. Next, the above sintered body is anodized. The anodization can be performed in a solution containing an electrolyte using the above sintered body as an anode. For this solution, aqueous solutions and nonaqueous solutions containing phosphoric acid, nitric acid, boric acid, citric acid, and sodium salts and ammonium salts thereof, and the like can be used.

According to the method, an underlying metal in which carbon atoms are present dissolved is anodized, and therefore, the dielectric containing carbon atoms according to the present invention is easily obtained. In the above method, first, an alloy of zirconium and titanium is heat-treated in a gas containing organic compound A. In this step, some of carbon atoms included in organic compound A are incorporated into the alloy of zirconium and titanium, and the alloy of titanium and zirconium containing a certain amount of carbon atoms is formed on the surface.

Third Embodiment A method for producing a dielectric according to this embodiment includes anodizing an alloy of zirconium and titanium in a solution containing organic compound B. According to the method, carbon is introduced into an underlying metal simultaneously with anodization, and therefore, the dielectric containing carbon atoms according to the present invention is easily obtained. In the above method, an alloy of zirconium and titanium is anodized in a solution containing organic compound B. In this step, some of carbon atoms included in organic compound B are incorporated into the alloy of zirconium and titanium, and the alloy of titanium and zirconium containing a certain amount of carbon atoms is formed on the surface.
