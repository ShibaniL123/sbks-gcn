DESCRIPTION NOVEL PEPTIDE HAVING5 LINKED CTL EPITOPES Technical Field The present invention relates to a novel peptide that is useful as a cancer antigen peptide. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novelcancer antigen peptidehaving 5 linked peptides capable of induction of HLA-A-restricted CTL responses and a pharmaceutical composition utilizing the same. Background Art Cancer is the top cause of death in Japan. Approximately 350,000 patients die of cancer every year, and cancer is still a serious disease nowadays. The primary techniques for cancer treatment that have been established are surgical resection, anti-cancer drug treatment, and radiation treatment. However, such treatment strategies are problematic in terms of, for example,recurrence, decline in quality of life(QOL), and lack of treatment options in the case of advanced-stage cancers that cannot be treated with the strategies described above. Cancer immunotherapy (cancer vaccines) has been expected as a novel therapeutic technique for a long period of time, and clinical studies on peptide vaccines for cancer treatment were initiated throughout the world in 1990 when epitope peptides in human tumor antigens became identifiable. According to the results of analysis of clinical studies conducted via administration of a peptide alone or in combination with other agents, however, the response rate is as low as 2.7% among 1,000 or more cases (Rosenberg SA et al., Nature Med., 2004, 10(9): 909-15). Thus, difficulty in practical application has been pointed out. Meanwhile, clinical studies involving the use of particular peptide vaccines for cancer treatment have been underwayfor a long period of time in Japan, and the achievements of such studies have gradually been articulated. In recent years, a strategy of administration of a multiplecancerpeptides instead of a single type of cancer peptide has been attempted, with the aim of improving the outcome for treatment. For example, the HLA type and specific immune responses of a patient are examined in advance, so as to implement a tailor-made cancer treatment using peptide vaccines comprising selecting multiple adequate peptides to be administered, and safety and anti-tumor effects thereof have been verified. Through administration of tailor-made peptide vaccines alone or in combination with anti-cancer drugs, more specifically, excellent clinical effects and safety have been achieved in cases of brain tumor, uterine cervix cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer(Terasaki, Μ. et al., J.Clin.Oncol., 2011, 29(3):337-44;Noguchi, Μ. et al., Cancer Immunol, lmmunother., 2010, 59(7): 1001-9;Yanagimoto, Η. et al., Cancer Sci., 2007, 98(4): 605-11). The cell-mediated immunityconsisting ofepitope specific cytotoxic Τ lymphocytes(hereafter, abbreviated as“CTL”), which are considered to be major effector cells in cancer treatment using peptide vaccines,is HLA-restrictive. Accordingly, development of peptide vaccines for cancer treatment exclusively targeting patients with a particular HLA type, and specificallyan HLA-A2 or HLA-A24 type, has been attemptedbecause of the large number of patients therewith. However, Japanese people with such two HLA types account for approximately 40% and 60%, respectively(Sette, A. et al., Immunogenetics, 1999, 50(3-4):201-12). Disadvantageously, patients with other HLA types cannot gain benefits from peptide vaccines for cancer treatment. In addition, the time of initiation of treatment would be postponed because of HLA typing performed prior to the initiation of treatment, and it would increase the burden on patients. Accordingly, research and development of peptide vaccines for cancer treatment that are applicable to all cancer patients without HLA typing are desired. Regarding cancer treatment using peptide vaccines, in addition to activations of CTLsforcell-mediated immunity, inductions of production of immunoglobulinsknown asthe humoral immunity is known to be attributable to survival benefit(Noguchi, Μ. et al., Cancer Biol. Then, 2011, 10(12): 1266-79). Summary of the Invention Objects to Be Attained by the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide a cancer antigen peptide that can be administered as a peptide vaccine for cancer to a wide range of cancer patients without the need for HLA typing and regardless of the HLA types of patients. Means for Attaining the Objects The present inventors have conducted concentrated studies in order to attain the above objects. As a result, they discovered that a peptide having 5 linked CTL epitopes obtained by linking 5 peptides via linkers selected from among CTL epitope peptides reported to be capable of induction ofHLA-A2, HLA-A24, HLA-A26, or HLA-A3 supertype-restricted CTL response or a plurality of HLA-A-restricted CTL responsescould be administered to a wide range of cancer patientswithout the need for HLA typing and regardless of the HLA types of patients.

Embodiments for Carrying out the Invention Hereafter, the present invention is described in greater detail. 1. Peptide having 5 linked epitopes In the present invention, the "peptide having 5 linked epitopes" means5 peptides selected from among CTL epitope peptides derived from the same and/or different tumor antigen molecules linearly linked via linkers as a single molecule. The "CTL epitope peptidederived from tumor antigen molecules" is a peptide resulting from decomposition of tumor antigens within tumor cells, and it is bound to the HLA class I molecule and presented on the cell surface. Thus, it is recognized by a tumor-specific CTL and/or it can induce and/or activate tumor-specific CTLs. "Induction of tumor-specific CTLs" refers to differentiation and/or proliferation of CTLs that specifically recognize CTL epitope peptides derived from tumor antigen molecules/n vitro or in vivo. Further, "activation of tumor-specific CTL" refers to production of interferon-y (IFN-y) when CTL recognizes an antigen presented by the HLA class I molecule. The "CTL epitope peptide derived from a tumor antigen molecule" used herein is occasionally referred to as a "CTL epitope peptide." Known peptides can be used as the CTL epitope peptides according to the present invention, and examples thereof include the following: PEPLKLVERLGAA (SEQ ID NO: l[WO 01/011044]); ΡΕΡ2:ASLDSDPWV (SEQ ID NO: 2[WO 02/010369]); ΡΕΡ3:LLQAEAPRL (SEQ ID NO: 3[WO 00/12701]); ΡΕΡ4:DΥSARWNEI (SEQ ID NO: 4[JP HI 1-318455 A (1999)]); PEP5:VYDΥΝCHVDL (SEQ ID NO: 5[WO 00/12701]); PEP6:LYAWEPSFL (SEQ ID NO: 6[JP 2003-000270 A]); ΡΕΡ7:QIRPIFSNR (SEQ ID NO: 7[Cancer Immunol, lmmunother., 2007,56(5), 689-698]). In this description, the peptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, the peptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 2, the peptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 3, the peptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 4, the peptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 5, the peptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 6, and the peptide as shown in SEQ ID NO: 7 are occasionally referred to as "PEP1," "PEP2,""PEP3,""PEP4," "PEP5,""PEP6," and "PEP7," respectively. In the present invention, a peptide having an amino acid sequence having substitution, insertion, deletion, and/or addition of one or a plurality of amino acids in the amino acid sequence of ΡΕΡ1, ΡΕΡ2, ΡΕΡ3, ΡΕΡ4, ΡΕΡ5, ΡΕΡ6, or ΡΕΡ7 and having the capacity for inducing CTL and the capacity for inducting immunoglobulin productions equivalent to or higher than those of the original peptide can be used as a "CTL epitope peptide." The term "plurality" used herein refers to 1 to 3, and preferably 1 or 2. An example of such peptide is a peptide obtained by substitution of amino acids having properties similar to those of the original amino acid (i.e., a peptide obtained by conservative amino acid substitution). ΡΕΡ1, ΡΕΡ2, ΡΕΡ3, ΡΕΡ4, and PEP5are captured bythe HLA-A2, ΡΕΡ2, ΡΕΡ4, ΡΕΡ5, andPEP6are captured bythe HLA-A24, ΡΕΡ2, ΡΕΡ4, ΡΕΡ5, andPEP7are captured bythe HLA-A3 supertype, PEP2andPEP5are captured bythe HLA-A26, and CTLs can then be induced and/or activated. Expression of genes encoding such CTL epitope peptides is observed in a plurality of types of cancers (Yang, D. et al., Cancer Res., 1999, 59: 4056-63;Harashima, Ν. et al., Eur. J. Immunol., 2001, 31(2), 323-32). Five peptides selected, optionally redundantly,from among ΡΕΡ1, ΡΕΡ2, ΡΕΡ3, ΡΕΡ4, ΡΕΡ5, ΡΕΡ6, and ΡΕΡ7 are linearly linked via linkers. Any linker can be used, provided that it is cleaved upon administration of a peptide having 5 linked epitopes to an organism, and the linked CTL epitope peptides can be separated from each other. Examples thereof include an ester bond, an ether bond, an amino bond, a sugar chain linker, a polyethylene glycol linker, and an amino acid linker. Examples of amino acid sequences used as amino acid linkers include an arginine dimer, a lysine dimer, a glycine dimer, a glycine pentamer, a glycine hexamer, an alanine-alanine-tyrosine (ΑΑΥ), isoleucine-leucine-alanine (ILA), and arginine-valine-lysine-arginine (RVKR), with an arginine dimer being preferable. CTL epitope peptides to be selected and the arrangements thereof can be determined by administering a peptide having 5 linked epitopes obtained by synthesizing epitopes in given combinations and in a given order to human HLA-A transgenic mice and evaluatingthe occurrence of CTL epitope peptide specific CTL induction in vivo. Preferably, the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention has one or more features selected from the features(l) to (12) below: (1) thepeptide comprisesa sequence composed of PEP5andPEP2successively disposed in such order from the Ν terminusvia a linker; (2) thepeptide comprisesa sequence composed ofPEP2and PEP4successively disposed in such order from the Ν terminusvia a linker; (3) thepeptide comprisesa sequence composed ofPEP4and PEP6successively disposed in such order from the Ν terminusvia a linker; (4) thepeptide comprisesa sequence composed ofPEP6and ΡΕΡ3successively disposed in such order from the Ν terminusvia a linker; (5) thepeptide comprisesa sequence composed ofPEP4and PEP 1 successively disposed in such order from the Ν terminusvia a linker; (6) thepeptide comprisesa sequence composed ofPEPland ΡΕΡ3successively disposed in such order from the Ν terminusvia a linker; (7) thepeptide comprisesa sequence composed ofPEP4and PEP2successively disposed in such order from the Ν terminusvia a linker; (8) thepeptide comprisesa sequence composed ofPEPland PEP4successively disposed in such order from the Ν terminusvia a linker; (9) thepeptide comprisesa sequence composed ofPEP5and PEP 1 successively disposed in such order from the Ν terminusvia a linker; (10) thepeptide comprisesa sequence composed ofPEP6and ΡΕΡ5successively disposed in such order from the Ν terminusvia a linker; (11) thepeptide comprisesPEP2 at the C terminus; and (12) thepeptide comprisesPEP3 atthe C terminus. Preferably, the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present inventioncomprises: (I) a sequence composed of ΡΕΡ5 and ΡΕΡ2, PEP6and ΡΕΡ5, or PEP4and PEP6successively disposed in such order from the Ν terminusvia a linker at the Ν terminus; and/or (II)a sequence composed ofPEP7and ΡΕΡ3, PEP4and ΡΕΡ3, PEP6and ΡΕΡ3, PEPland ΡΕΡ3, PEP5and ΡΕΡ2, PEP4and ΡΕΡ2, or PEP5and ΡΕΡ3successively disposed in such order from the Ν terminusvia a linkerat the C terminus. More preferably, thepeptide having 5 linked epitopesaccording to the present invention comprises or consists of a sequence selected from among the sequences (a) to (ρ) below, wherein represents a linker: (a) ΡΕΡ5-ΡΕΡ2-ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ7-ΡΕΡ3; (b) PEP5 -ΡΕΡ2-ΡΕΡ7-ΡΕΡ3 -ΡΕΡ4; (c) ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ6-ΡΕΡ5-ΡΕΡ7-ΡΕΡ3; (d) ΡΕΡ5-ΡΕΡ2-ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ6-ΡΕΡ3; (e) ΡΕΡ5 -ΡΕΡ2-ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ1-ΡΕΡ3 ; (f) ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ5-ΡΕΡ2-ΡΕΡ7-ΡΕΡ3; (g) ΡΕΡ7-ΡΕΡ3-ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ5-ΡΕΡ2; (h) PEP 5 -ΡΕΡ7-ΡΕΡ3 -ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ2 ; (i) ΡΕΡ6-ΡΕΡ1 -ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ5-ΡΕΡ2; (j) ΡΕΡ6-ΡΕΡ5-ΡΕΡ1 -ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ2; (k) ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ5 -PEP 1-ΡΕΡ6-ΡΕΡ3 ; (l) ΡΕΡ7-ΡΕΡ2-ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ5-ΡΕΡ3; (m) ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ2-ΡΕΡ7-ΡΕΡ5-ΡΕΡ3; (η) ΡΕΡ7-ΡΕΡ2-ΡΕΡ5-ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ3 ; (ο) ΡΕΡ5-ΡΕΡ2-ΡΕΡ7-ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ3;or (ρ) ΡΕΡ5 -ΡΕΡ2-ΡΕΡ4-ΡΕΡ3 -ΡΕΡ7. In the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention, a CTL epitope peptide specific CTLs can be induced and/or activated and immunoglobulins specific for a relevant CTL epitope peptide can be induced in preferably two types, more preferably three types, further preferably 4 types, and most preferably 5 types of CTL epitope peptides of the 5 linked types of CTL epitope peptides. In the present invention, the term "immunoglobulins" refers to IgG, IgM, IgA, or IgD. 2. Production of apeptide having 5 linked epitopes The peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention can be produced by common techniques, for example, peptide synthesis, such as liquid-phase synthesis or solid-phasesynthesis, or peptide synthesis involving the use of an automated peptide synthesizer (Kelley et al., Genetics Engineering Principles and Methods, Setlow, J.K. eds., Plenum Press NY., 1990, Vol.12, pp.l-19;Stewart et al., Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis, 1989, W.H. Freeman Co.;Houghten, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U.S.A., 1985, 82: ρ.5132, "Shin SeikagakuJikkenKouza (New Biochemical Experiment) 1, Protein IV, 1992, the Japanese Biochemical Society (ed.), Tokyo Kagaku Doujin). Peptide synthesis is carried out by preparing amino acids in which functional groups other than a-amino groups and a-carboxyl groups to be bound of the amino acids are protected and forming peptide bonds between a-amino groupsand a-carboxyl groups of the amino acids. In general, a carboxyl group of an amino acid residue located at the C terminus of a peptide is bound to a solid phase via an adequate spacer or linker. A protective group at the amino terminus of the dipeptide obtained above is selectively removed and a peptide bond is formed between the amino terminus and the a-carboxyl group of the subsequent amino acid residue. This procedure is continued to produce a peptide with a protected side group, and all protective groups are removed and separated from the solid phase at the end. Protective group types, methods for protecting the same, and methods of peptide binding are described in detail in the documents mentioned above. Alternatively, a peptide may be produced via genetic recombination with the use of a nucleic acid encoding the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention, phage display, or other techniques. A genetic recombination technique comprises inserting DNA encoding the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention into an adequate expression vector, introducing the vector into adequate host cells, culturing the cells, and recovering the target peptides from the cells or the extracellular fluid. Examples of vectors include, but are not limited to, plasmid, phage, cosmid, phagemid, and virus vectors. Vectors are introduced into host cells, such as bacterial host cells (e.g., Ε. coli and Bacillus subtilis), yeast cells, insect cells, animal cells (e.g., mammalian cells), and plant cells. Transformation or transfection into such cells is carried out via, for example, the calcium phosphate method, electroporation, lipofection, the particle gun method, or the PEG method. Transformed cells are cultured in accordance with a conventional technique for host organismculture. In order to facilitate recovery of the peptide according to the present invention, it is preferable that a peptide generated via expression be secreted extracellularly. To this end, DNA encoding a peptide sequence that enables peptide secretion from the cells is bound to the 5' terminal side of DNA encoding a target peptide. Alternatively, a target peptide accumulated in the cells can be recovered. In such a case, cells are physically or chemically broken and a target peptide is recovered via a protein purification technique. The peptide thus obtained can be recovered or purified via a conventional technique, for example, chromatography techniques, such as gel filtration chromatography, ion exchange column chromatography, affinity chromatography, reversephase column chromatography, or HPLC, ammonium sulfate fractionation, ultrafiltration, or immunoadsorption. 3. Cytotoxic Τ lymphocytes With the use of the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention,CTL epitope peptide specificCTLs that damagecancer cells can be obtained in vitro. A method for inducing CTL using a CTL epitope peptidem vitro is known (e.g., JP 2006-14637 A), and such technique can be employed in the present invention. For example, plate adhesion cells in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from healthy individuals or cancer patients are cultured in the presence of cytokines, such as GM-CSF orIL-4 so as to induce dendritic cells (DCs). After the dendritic cells have been pulsed with the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention, x-rays are applied thereto, so as to prepare antigen-presenting cells (stimulators). When DCs cannot be used, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from healthy individuals or the same cancer patientsmay be pulsed with the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention, x-rays may be applied thereto, and the resultants may be used. Subsequently, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from healthy individuals or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or lymphocytes in the relevant lymph nodes (i.e., responders) derived from cancer patientsare added and then cultured in the presence of cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-4, or IL-7. Thereafter, the antigen presenting cells obtained via pulsing described aboveare stimulated again with the addition of the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present inventionand further cultured in the presence of cytokines, such as IL-2. Any medium in which Τ lymphocytes can survive may be used as a cell culture medium used for CTL induction. For example, a medium prepared by adding various cytokines (e.g., IL-2) and fetal calf serum (FCS) to RHAMa medium (LAK medium described in Kawai, Κ., Sasaki, Τ., Saijo-Kurita, Κ., Akaza, Η., Koiso, Κ., and Ohno, Τ., Cancer Immunol. Immunother., 35, 225-229, 1992), AIMV medium (GIBCO BRL, Life Technologies, INC.), or RPMI1640 medium can be used. Culture may beconducted under conditions well known in the art. For example, culture temperatureis at 33°C to 41°C, and preferably 37°C. An inert gas containing air or oxygen of adequate concentration and carbon dioxide of adequate concentration (e.g., 5% C02) to adjust the pH of the medium to about 7.4 can be used as a gas phase. Culture is preferably conducted for 4 to 10 days, and more preferably 7 days. Some CTLs induced via such culture are CTL epitope peptide specificforpreferably two types, more preferably three types, further preferably four types, and most preferably five types of CTL epitope peptides among the five typesof CTL epitope peptides constituting the peptide having 5 linked epitopes, and thus they can specifically damagecancer cells. 4. Pharmaceutical composition The peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention can be used as an active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition used for cancer immunotherapy. The pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can contain, as an active ingredient(s), one or more of thepeptideshaving 5 linked epitopes. Thus, stronger effects can be expected by including a plurality of thepeptideshaving 5 linked epitopes. Genes encoding ΡΕΡ1, ΡΕΡ2, ΡΕΡ3, ΡΕΡ4, ΡΕΡ5, ΡΕΡ6, and ΡΕΡ7 included in the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention are observed to be expressed in a plurality of types of solid cancers and blood cancers. Examples of solid cancers include brain tumor, lung cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, uterine cervix cancer, cancer of uterine body, ovarian cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, GIST, pancreaticcancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, anal cancer, renal cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, malignant melanoma, skin cancer, lingual cancer, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, liposarcoma, angiosarcoma, rhabdomyoblastoma, and leiomyosarcoma. Examples of blood cancersinclude leukemia, malignant lymphoma, and myeloma. Accordingly, the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention is useful for the treatment or prevention of such cancers. The term "treatment or prevention of cancer" used herein refers to prevention of the development/recurrence of cancer, suppression of the progression/exacerbation of cancer, or the improvement of cancer conditions. The pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can contain pharmaceutically acceptable materials, such as various common organic or inorganic carriers. Examples of pharmaceutical carriers that can be used include stabilizers, antibacterials, buffers, isotonizing agents, chelating agents, pH adjusters, surfactants, fillers, thickeners, binders, humectants, disintegrators, surface active agents, lubricants, soothing agents, diluents, and excipients that are generally used in accordance with the form of administration of relevant pharmaceutical preparations. Pharmaceutical preparations are preferably prepared in the form of formulations supplemented with such carriers in accordance with conventional techniques. The pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can contain an adjuvant that is known to be used at the time of vaccine administration. Examples of adjuvants include Complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA), Incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA), alum, lipid A, monophosphoryl lipid A, bacterial preparations such as BCG (.Bacillus-Calmette-Guerrin), preparations of bacterial components such as tuberculin, naturally-occurring polymers, such as keyhole limpet hemocyanin and yeast mannan, muramyl-tripeptide, muramyl-dipeptide, or a derivative of either thereof, alum, and nonionic block copolymers. These adjuvants can be used alone or in combinations of two or more. Adjuvants may be administered simultaneously with the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention in the form of a mixture or as an emulsion. In addition to the peptide having 5 linked epitopes, the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may comprise one or more of a known CTL epitope peptidederived from tumor antigen molecules, a peptide containing the same, or a peptide comprising the CTL epitopepeptides linked to each other (hereafter, referred to as "known CTL epitope peptides derived from tumor antigen molecules"). Examples of known CTL epitope peptides derived from tumor antigen molecules include, but are not limited to, WT-1 ρ126-134, modified(M236Y) WT-1 ρ235-243, NY-ESO-1 ρ157-165, modified (Τ210Μ) gplOO ρ209-217, survivin-2B ρ80-88, Her-2/neu ρ63-71, VEGFR2 ρ169-177, MART-1 ρ26-35, Glypican-3 ρ298-306, and SPARC ρ143-151. In this case, the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention and the known CTL epitope peptides derived from tumor antigen molecules may be prepared in the form of a single-agent preparation. Alternatively, a preparation comprising, as an active ingredient, the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention may be separated from a preparation comprising, as an active ingredient, the known CTL epitope peptides derived from tumor antigen molecules. The dosage form of the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be selected in accordance with the form of administration. Representative examples of dosage forms include, but are not limited to, liquid preparations, emulsions, liposome preparations, lipid emulsions, cyclodextrin inclusion complexes, suspensions, ointments, creams, transdermally absorbed agents, transmucosallyabsorbed agents, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, powdered drugs, granules, fine grains, and syrups. In accordance with the route of administration, such dosage forms are further classified as, for example, oral preparations, parenteralpreparations, transnasalpreparations, transvaginal preparations, suppositories, sublingual formulations, inhalants, eye drops, or ear drops, and such preparations can be combined, molded, or prepared in accordance with conventional techniques. In addition to the application in the form of liquid preparations, such preparation can be subjected to lyophilization, so as to make the pharmaceutical preparation storable. When such pharmaceutical preparation is to be used, it may be dissolved with the aid of, for example, a buffer containing water and physiological saline, so as to adjust the concentration thereof to an adequate level. The pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may comprise, as an active ingredient, CTLs induced in vitro with the use of the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention. Such pharmaceutical composition is preferably in the form of a parenteral agent. 5. Treatment method The pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be administered to a wide range of cancer patients, such as patients who are positive for HLA types selected from the group consisting of HLA-A2, HLA-A24, HLA-A26, and HLA-A3 supertype, and treatment can be initiated without conducting HLA typing prior to the treatment. When the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention is administered to a cancer patient, CTLs specific for two or more, preferably 3 or more,more preferably 4 or more, and further preferably 5 or more types of CTL epitope peptides constituting thepeptide having 5 linked epitopes as an active ingredient of the pharmaceutical composition can be induced and/or activated. In addition, production of immunoglobulins specific for relevantCTL epitope peptides can be induced. The level of induction of immunoglobulin production upon administration of the peptide having 5 linked epitopes as an active ingredient is significantly higher than the level of induction of immunoglobulin production observed upon administration of a mixture of CTL epitope peptides that are to be contained in the peptide having 5 linked epitopes but are not linked to each other. Accordingly, the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention can effectively treat or prevent cancer in a cancer patient. The pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be administered via, for example, oraladministration, intravenousadministration, intraarterialadministration, intramuscularadministration, subcutaneousadministration, intracutaneousadministration, sublingualadministration, intraperitonealadministration, intrarectaladministration, transdermaladministration, transmucosaladministration, transnasaladministration, transvaginaladministration, transocularadministration, or aspiration. When preparations comprising, as active ingredients, a plurality of peptideshaving 5 linked epitopes or known CTL epitope peptides derived from tumor antigen molecules are prepared in the form of separate pharmaceutical compositions, such pharmaceutical compositions can be administered simultaneously or non-simultaneouslyvia the same route or via separate routes. Dosage of the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be adequately adjusted in accordance with factors such as the conditions/severity of cancer to be treated, the age of the patient, or the body weight of the patient. For example, a pharmaceutical composition containing the peptide having 5 linked epitopes in an amount of 0.0001 mg to 1000 mg, preferably 0.001 mg to 100 mg, and further preferably 0.01 mg to 50 mg may be repeatedly administered once every several days, several weeks, or several months. When the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention comprises, as active ingredients, CTLs induced in vitro with the use of the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention, it is preferable that 2χ106 to 2xl08CTLs be administered per kg of the body weight every day at intervals of 1 to 2 weeks. The pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can be administered to a cancer patient in combination with pharmaceutical products that are generally used for cancer chemotherapy. Examples of such pharmaceutical products include: alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide, temozolomide, and bendamustine; antimetabolites, such as tegafur-uracil, tegafur-gimeracil-oteracil potassium, methotrexate, and gemcitabine; platinum-containing drugs, such as cisplatin and oxaliplatin; plant alkaloid preparations, such as irinotecan, eribulin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, and vincristine; carcinostatic antibiotics, such as doxorubicin, bleomycin, and actinomycin D; molecular-targeted drugs, such as imatinib, sunitinib, gefitinib, sorafenib, everolimus, trastuzumab, bevacizumab, rituximab, cetuximab, panitumumab, and mogamulizumab; and hormonal therapy agents, such as bicalutamide, estramustine, and exemestane. Such pharmaceutical products can be administeredsimultaneously or non-simultaneously with the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention via the sameroute or via separate routes. Hereafter, the present invention is described in greater detail with reference to the examples, although the present invention is not limited to these examples. Examples Example 1: Peptide synthesis and purification The CTL epitope peptides and the peptideshaving 5 linked epitopes were synthesized using a commercially available peptide synthesizer (Prelude, ProteinTechnologies, Inc.) by the solid-phase synthesis (Fmoc) method. The resulting various synthetic peptides were purified using the YMC-Pack Pro C18 column (YMC Co., Ltd.) and the HPLC system (Gilson), lyophilized, stored at cool temperature in the dark, and then provided to the examples described below. Table 1 shows the amino acid sequences of the synthesized CTL epitope peptides and Table 2 shows the amino acid sequences of thepeptideshaving 5 linked epitopes.

Example 2: Inductions of epitope peptide specificCTLs in mouseand detection of CTLsusing ELISPOT The peptideshaving 5 linked epitopes were dissolved indistilled water (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Factory Inc.) at 2 mg/mlor 4 mg/ml, andsolutionwas filled into the Β Braun Injektsyringe. After the equivalent amountIncomplete Freund’s adjuvant(IFA) was filled into another syringe, these syringes wereto each other using a GP syringe connector, and a solution of the peptideshavinglinked epitopes was thoroughly mixed with IFA to prepare an emulsion. The emulsionweekly administered in amounts of 100 μ1 each in the vicinity ofbase of tail of micetransgenic and HLA-A24 transgenic mice (Taconic)), and administrationswereout twice in total. Inguinal lymph nodes were corrected from mice 1 week after theadministration. A lymph node cell suspension was adjusted tousing Complete Medium (RPMI-1640,10% heat-inactivated FBS,100U/mlpenicillin,100μg/mlstreptomycin,and 50μΜ 2-mercaptoethanol), the target CTL epitope peptide (final concentration: 10pg/ml), recombinant mouse IL-15(final concentration: lOOng/ml), and recombinant mouse IL-21 (final concentration: lOOng/ml) were added, these cellswere plated onto a 24-well plate at lml/well, and were cultured in an incubator at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 8 days. Thereafter, the cells were collected and plated on an anti-IFN-y antibody-immobilized plate included in the Murine IFN-y ELISpot Kit(GEN-PROBE) at lxl05cells/well. Subsequently, splenocytes obtained from the spleen of syngeneic mouse and irradiated with 30-Gy X-rays were plated on the same plate at 1 / 105cells/well as antigenpresenting cells, the target CTL epitope peptide or the negative control peptide (final concentration: 1 Opg/ml)were added, and incubation was carried out in an incubator at 37°C in the presence of 5% CCEovemight. On the following day, IFN-y-producing cell spots were coloredaccording to manufacturer’s instructions. The number of IFN-y-producing cell spots was quantified using an ELISPOT analyzer (Immunospot S6,Cellular Technology Ltd.). Induction of CTL epitope peptide specificCTL was evaluated as positive when the number of IFN-y-producing cell spots in the wells supplemented with the target CTL epitope peptides was significantly higher than that observed in the wells supplementedwith the negative control peptides(Student’s t-test, p<0.05). WT1 or Her2 was used as the negative control peptide. In order to visualize the CTL induction level, the results of the following equation were designated as "A" (the average number of IFN-y-producing cell spots in wells supplementedwith the target CTL epitope peptides) - (the average number of IFN-y-producing cell spots in wells supplementedwith the negative control peptides). The results are represented as positive in case of 10 < A< 100;medium positive in case of 100<A<200; and strongly positive in case of 200≤Α. Fig. 1 shows the results of evaluation of CTL epitope peptide specificCTL induction. As shown in Fig. 1, a peptide having 5 linked epitopes comprising a PEP5-RR-PEP2 or PEP4-RR-PEP2sequence or a peptide having 5 linked epitopes comprising ΡΕΡ3 at the C terminus induced at least 3 types of CTLs. In contrast, there were no more than two CTLs induced by a peptide composed of 5 epitopes such as TPVI8. The aboveresults demonstrate that administration of a peptide having 5 linked epitopes prepared by linking known CTL epitope peptides via arginine dimers to mice cannot always induce epitope specificCTLs specific for all CTL epitope peptides. Example 3: Preparation of CTL epitope peptide-immobilized beads Peptides were immobilized onto χΜΑΡ Multi-Analyte COOH Microspheres(LuminexCorporation;hereafter referred to as "beads") in the manner described below. The beads werewashed with MES buffer(0.1M MES-NaOH;pH7.0), the supernatant was removed by centrifugation. This washing process was repeated twice and the beads were then suspended in 75 μ1 of MES buffer. 100μ1 of CTL epitope peptidesolution (lmg/ml), and 5 μ1 of 10 mg/ml EDC(1 -ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride)solution was added into beads suspension then mixed well. Thereafter, the reaction was performed at 30°C in the dark overnight. After the removal of supernatant by centrifugation on the following day, 125 μ1 of 1Μ Tris-HCl was added, and incubation was carried out at 30°C in the dark for 30 minutes. After the supernatant was removed again, the beads were washed twice with wash buffer(PBS(-),0.05% Tween20) and were suspended in Immunoblock(DS Pharma Biomedical Co.,Ltd.). Thus, immobilization of the CTL epitope peptide was completed. Example 4: Measurement of CTL-epitope specificIgG antibody titer The peptideshaving 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention were dissolved in Otsuka distilled water (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Factory Inc.) at 2 mg/ml, and the resulting solution was filled into a Β Braun Injektsyringe. After the equivalent amount oflFA was filled into another syringe, these syringes were connected to each other using a GP syringe connector, and a solution of the peptideshaving 5 linked epitopes was thoroughly mixed with IFA to prepare an emulsion. The emulsion was weekly administered in amounts of 100 μ1 each in the vicinity ofbase of tale of CBF1 mice (C57BL/6xBalb/c FI), and administration was carried out three times in total. The blood was collected from mice 1 week after the final administration to obtain serum samples. As control samples, emulsions were prepared using peptide mixtures of ΡΕΡ2, ΡΕΡ3, ΡΕΡ4, ΡΕΡ5, and ΡΕΡ7(1 mg/ml each), and the resulting emulsions were administered in accordance with the same schedule as with the peptide having 5 linked epitopes(the mixture-administered group). The CTL epitope peptide-immobilized beads diluted with Immunoblock were dispensedinto wells of a 96-well filter plate. The dispensed beads were washed with a wash buffer, subsequently 100μ1 of mouse serum samples diluted 200-fold with Immunoblockwere added into each wells. The plate was incubated for 90 minutes at 30°C with 600 rpm mixing. After the three times of plate washing with a washbuffer, 100μ1 of biotinylated-anti-mouse IgG (H+L)(Vector Laboratories) diluted 500-fold with Immunoblockwas added into each well, and the plate was incubated for 60 minutes at 30°C with 600 rpm mixingAfter the three times of plate washing with a washbuffer, 100μ1 of streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin conjugate(Invitrogen)diluted 500-fold with Immunoblock was added into each well, and the plate was incubatedfor 30 minutes at 30°C with 600 rpm mixing. After the three times of plate washing with a washbuffer, 100μ1 ofwash buffer was added into each well to suspend beads, and the mean fluorescence intensity of PE which specifically bound to relevant beads was measured using the Bio-Plex Suspension Array System(BIO-RAD). The results of measurement of the CTL-epitope specific IgG titer are as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 shows the degree of the CTL epitope peptide specific IgG antibody production compared with thatof negative control group(hereafter abbreviated as the "IFA group") mice.The results from IFA groupmicewhich were administrated emulsion prepared by mixing equivalent amounts of IFA and Otsuka distilled water (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Factory Inc.)were compared with the results which were obtained in accordance with the same treatment schedule as that of the CTL epitope peptide mixture or the peptide having 5 linked epitopes. As shown in Fig. 2,the induction of the CTL epitope specific IgG antibody production was not observed in the mixture-administered group, compared with the IFA group. In contrast, strong induction of CTL epitope specificIgGantibody production was observed frequently when the peptide having 5 linked epitopes was administered. In addition, the amount of IgG production was found to be significantly higher (e.g., several ten times to several hundred times higher) depending on the type of the peptide having 5 linked epitopesadministered. In the case of a peptide comprising 5 epitopes linked to each otherin the order such asTPV17, multipleCTL epitope specificIgG antibodies production was not induced. Theseresults demonstrate that administration of the peptide having 5 linked epitopes can more strongly activate antitumor immunity than administration of a mixture of CTL epitope peptides constituting the peptide having 5 linked epitopes. For a cancer patient who hasbeen treated with a peptide vaccine for cancer, induction of CTL epitope peptide specificIgG production and induction of epitope peptidespecificCTL are both effective for life prolongation. Accordingly, the life prolongation effects attained by the present invention are superior to those attained bycancer treatment using peptide vaccines comprising known CTL epitope peptides or mixtures thereof. Therefore, the peptide having 5 linked epitopes according to the present invention can be suitably used as a therapeutic and/or preventive agent for cancers or diseases caused thereby and peptide vaccines for cancer that can provide superior treatment outcomes compared with cancer treatment using peptide vaccines comprising known CTL epitope peptides or mixtures thereof.
