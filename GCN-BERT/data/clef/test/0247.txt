Step 2: preparation of intermediate trans-N-allyloxy-6-[[tert-butyl(dimethl)silylloxymethyl-4-iodo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-3-amine (1c)
To a solution of tert-butyl trans-3-[allyloxy-(2-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl-amino]-6-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-4-iodo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyridine-1-carboxylate (1b) (17.0 g, 23.95 mmol) in DCM (177 mL) was added ZnBr2 (16.2 g, 71.86 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt overnight then diluted with DCM and successively washed with saturated saturated sodium bicarbonate and brine. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude was diluted with ACN (177 mL). K2CO3 (16.6 g, 119.77 mmol) was added, followed by thiophenol (12.3 mL, 119.77 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 1 h and concentrated in vacuo. DCM was added and the resulting solids were removed by filtration. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The crude was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (DCM/MeOH 100/0 to 90/10) to give trans-N-allyloxy-6-[[tert-butyl(dimethyl)silyl]oxymethyl]-4-iodo-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-3-amine (1c) (7.99 g, 18.83 mmol, 78%).
