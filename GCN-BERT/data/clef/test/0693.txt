Step 3: 5-((3R,5S,6R)-5-amino-6-(2,5-difluorophenyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)-3-methyl-1-methylsulfonyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole
To dichloromethane (0.7 mL) were added 5-((3R,5S,6R)-5-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-6-(2, 5-difluorophenyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)-3-methyl-1-methylsulfonyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3, 4-c]pyrazole (16 mg, 0.031 mmol), and benzenesulfonic acid (20 mg, 0.125 mmol), and strirred at room temperature overnight. Triethylamine (23 mg, 0.228 mmol) was added, and the solvend was removed by spin-evaporation, and then the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to give 5-((3R,5S,6R)-5-amino-6-(2,5-difluorophenyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)-3-methyl-1-methylsulfonyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazole (1.7 mg). Yield: 13%.
