Step 2. benzyl 1-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane-3-carboxylate
To a solution of 3-((benzyloxy)carbonyl)-3-azabicyclo[3.1.1]heptane-1-carboxylic acid (150 mg, 0.545 mmol) and triethylamine (0.091 mL, 0.65 mmol) in tert-butanol (3.0 mL) was added diphenyl phosphoryl azide (0.129 mL, 0.599 mmol) and the solution was heated at 85Â° C. in a sealed vial overnight. LCMS data indicated that the major reaction component was the desired product. The crude reaction mixture was concentrated in-vacuo and the residue was purified by CombiFlash chromatography (25 g column, eluting with 0-50% ethyl acetate/hexanes) to afford the desired product (45 mg, 24%). LCMS for C19H26N2O4 (M+Na)+: calculated m/z=369.4; found 369.1.
