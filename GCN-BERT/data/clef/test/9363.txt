CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/596,458, filed Oct. 28, 2008, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,143,376, which is a U.S. National Phase of PCT/GB2005/001924, filed May 18, 2005, which published as WO 2005/113595 on Dec. 1, 2005, which claims the benefit of GB Application No. 0411123.3 filed May 19, 2004 and GB Application No. 0419643.2 filed Sep. 3, 2004. The foregoing applications, and all documents cited therein or during their prosecution (“appln cited documents”) and all documents cited or referenced in the appln cited documents, and all documents cited or referenced herein (“herein cited documents”), and all documents cited or referenced in herein cited documents, together with any manufacturer's instructions, descriptions, product specifications, and product sheets for any products mentioned herein or in any document incorporated by reference herein, are hereby incorporated herein by reference, and may be employed in the practice of the invention. The present invention relates to T cell receptors (TCRs) having the property of binding to SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 and comprising at least one TCR α chain variable domain and/or at least one TCR β chain variable domain characterized in that said TCR has a KD for the said SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex of less than or equal to 1 μM and/or has an off-rate (koff) for the SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex of 1×10−3 S−1 or slower. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION The SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126) peptide is derived from the NY-ESO-1 protein that is expressed by a range of tumours (Chen et al., (1997) PNAS USA 94 1914-1918). The Class I HLA molecules of these cancerous cells present peptides from this protein, including SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126). Therefore, the SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A2 complex provides a cancer marker that TCRs can target, for example for the purpose of delivering cytotoxic or immuno-stimulatory agents to the cancer cells. However, for that purpose it would be desirable if the TCR had a higher affinity and/or a slower off-rate for the peptide-HLA complex than native TCRs specific for that complex. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This invention makes available for the first time TCRs having high affinity (KD) of the interaction less than or equal to 1 μM, and/or a slower off-rate (koff) of 1×10−3 S−1 or slower, for the SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex. Such TCRs are useful, either alone or associated with a therapeutic agent, for targeting cancer cells presenting that complex. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a T-cell receptor (TCR) having the property of binding to SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 and comprising at least one TCR α chain variable domain and/or at least one TCR β chain variable domain characterized in that said TCR has a KD for the said SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex of less than or equal to 1 μM and/or has an off-rate (koff) for the SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex of 1×10−3 S−1 or slower. The KD and/or (koff) measurement can be made by any of the known methods. A preferred method is the Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore) method of Example 5. For comparison, the interaction of a disulfide-linked soluble variant of the native 1G4 TCR (see SEQ ID NO: 9 for TCR α chain and SEQ ID NO: 10 for TCR β chain) and the SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex has a KD of approximately 10 μM, an off-rate (koff) of 1.28×10−1 S−1 and a half-life of 0.17 minutes as measured by the Biacore-base method of Example 5. The native 1G4 TCR specific for the SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex has the following Valpha chain and Vbeta chain gene usage: Alpha chain—TRAV21Beta chain:—TRBV 6.5 The native 1G4 TCR can be used as a template into which various mutations that impart high affinity and/or a slow off-rate for the interaction between TCRs of the invention and the SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex can be introduced. Thus the invention includes TCRs which are mutated relative to the native 1G4 TCR α chain variable domain (see FIG. 1a and SEQ ID No: 1) and/or β chain variable domain (see FIG. 1b and SEQ ID NO: 2) in at least one complementarity determining region (CDR) and/or variable domain framework region thereof. It is also contemplated that other hypervariable regions in the variable domains of the TCRs of the invention, such as the hypervariable 4 (HV4) regions, may be mutated so as to produce a high affinity mutant. Native TCRs exist in heterodimeric αβ or γδ forms. However, recombinant TCRs consisting of a single TCR α or TCR β chain have previously been shown to bind to peptide MHC molecules. In one embodiment the TCR of the invention comprise both an α chain variable domain and an TCR β chain variable domain. As will be obvious to those skilled in the art the mutation(s) in the TCR α chain sequence and/or TCR β chain sequence may be one or more of substitution(s), deletion(s) or insertion(s). These mutations can be carried out using any appropriate method including, but not limited to, those based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction enzyme-based cloning, or ligation independent cloning (LIC) procedures. These methods are detailed in many of the standard molecular biology texts. For further details regarding polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis and restriction enzyme-based cloning see (Sambrook & Russell, (2001) Molecular Cloning—A Laboratory Manual (3rd Ed.) CSHL Press) Further information on LIC procedures can be found in (Rashtchian, (1995) Curr Opin Biotechnol 6 (1): 30-6) It should be noted that any αβ TCR that comprises similar Valpha and Vbeta gene usage and therefore amino acid sequence to that of the 1G4 TCR could make a convenient template TCR. It would then be possible to introduce into the DNA encoding one or both of the variable domains of the template αβ TCR the changes required to produce the mutated high affinity TCRs of the invention. As will be obvious to those skilled in the art, the necessary mutations could be introduced by a number of methods, for example site-directed mutagenesis. The TCRs of the invention include those in which one or more of the TCR alpha chain variable domain amino acids corresponding to those listed below are mutated relative to the amino acid occurring at these positions in the sequence provided for the native 1G4 TCR alpha chain variable domain in FIG. 1a and SEQ ID No: 1. Unless stated to the contrary, the TCR amino acid sequences herein are generally provided including an N-terminal methionine (Met or M) residue. As will be known to those skilled in the art this residue may be removed during the production of recombinant proteins. Furthermore, unless stated to the contrary, the soluble TCR and TCR variable domain sequences have been truncated at the N-terminus thereof. (Resulting in the lose of the N-terminal “K” and “NA” in the TCR alpha and beta chain sequences respectively). As will be obvious to those skilled in the art these “missing” N-terminal TCR residues may be re-introduced into the TCRs of the present invention. As will also be obvious to those skilled in the art, it may be possible to truncate the sequences provided at the C-terminus and/or N-terminus thereof, by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more residues, without substantially affecting the pMHC binding characteristics of the TCR, all such trivial variants are encompassed by the present invention. As used herein the term “variable domain” is understood to encompass all amino acids of a given TCR which are not included within the constant domain as encoded by the TRAC gene for TCR α chains and either the TRBC1 or TRBC2 for TCR β chains (T cell receptor Factsbook, (2001) LeFranc and LeFranc, Academic Press, ISBN 0-12-441352-8) As is known to those skilled in the art, part of the diversity of the TCR repertoire is due to variations which occur in the amino acid encoded by the codon at the boundary between the variable domain, as defined herein, and the constant domain. For example, the codon that is present at this boundary in the wild-type IG4 TCR sequence results in the presence of the Tyrosine (Y) residue at the C-terminal of the variable domain sequences herein. This Tyrosine replaces the N-terminal Asparagine (N) residue encoded by the TRAC gene shown in FIG. 8A. Embodiments of the invention include mutated TCRs which comprise mutation of one or more of alpha chain variable domain amino acids corresponding to: 20V, 51Q, 52S, 53S, 94P, 95T, 96S, 97G, 98G, 99S, 100Y, 101I and 103T, for example the amino acids: 20A51P/S/T or M52P/F or G53W/H or T94H or A95L/M/A/Q/Y/E/I/F/V/N/G/S/D or R96L/T/Y/I/Q/V/E/X/A/W/R/G/H/D or K97D/N/V/S/T or A98P/H/S/T/W or A99T/Y/D/H/V/N/E/G/Q/K/A/I or R100F/M or D101P/T/ or M103A The numbering used above is the same as that shown in FIG. 1a and SEQ ID No: 1 Embodiments of the invention also include TCRs which comprise mutation of one or more of the TCR beta chain variable domain amino acids corresponding to those listed below, are relative to the amino acid occurring at these positions in the sequence provided for the native 1G4 TCR alpha chain variable domain of the native 1G4 TCR beta chain in FIG. 1b and SEQ ID No: 2. The amino acids referred to which may be mutated are: 18M, 50G, 51A, 52G, 53I, 55D, 56Q, 70T, 94Y, 95V and 97N, for example: 18V50S or A51V or I52Q53T or M55R56R70I94N or F95L97G or D The numbering used above is the same as that shown in FIG. 1b and SEQ ID No: 2 Further preferred embodiments of the invention are provided by TCRs comprising one of the mutated alpha chain variable domain amino acid sequences shown in FIG. 6 (SEQ ID Nos: 11 to 83). Phenotypically silent variants of such TCRs also form part of this invention. Additional preferred embodiments of the invention are provided by TCRs comprising one of the mutated beta chain variable domain amino acid sequences shown in FIG. 7 or 13. (SEQ ID Nos: 84 to 99 or 117 to 121). Phenotypically silent variants of such TCRs also form part of this invention. Native TCRs exist in heterodimeric αβ or γδ forms. However, recombinant TCRs consisting of αα or ββ homodimers have previously been shown to bind to peptide MHC molecules. Therefore, one embodiment of the invention is provided by TCR αα or TCR ββ homodimers. Further preferred embodiments are provided by TCRs of the invention comprising the alpha chain variable domain amino acid sequence and the beta chain variable domain amino acid sequence combinations listed below, phenotypically silent variants of such TCRs also form part of this invention: Alpha chain variable Beta chain variable domain sequence, domain sequence, SEQ ID NO: SEQ ID NO: 1 84 1 85 1 86 1 87 1 88 11 84 12 84 12 85 12 90 11 85 11 86 11 92 11 93 13 86 14 84 14 85 15 84 15 85 16 84 16 85 17 86 18 86 19 84 20 86 21 84 21 85 22 84 23 86 24 84 25 84 26 84 27 84 28 84 29 84 30 84 31 84 32 84 33 84 20 86 34 86 35 89 36 89 37 89 38 89 39 89 16 89 17 89 31 89 40 89 1 90 1 91 41 90 42 2 42 85 42 92 1 92 1 93 43 92 44 92 45 92 46 92 47 92 48 84 49 94 50 84 50 94 51 94 51 95 1 94 1 85 51 84 52 84 52 94 52 95 53 84 49 95 49 94 54 92 55 92 56 92 57 92 58 92 59 92 60 92 61 92 62 92 63 92 64 92 65 92 66 92 67 92 68 92 69 92 70 92 71 92 72 92 73 92 74 92 75 92 76 92 77 92 78 92 79 92 80 92 81 92 82 92 83 92 11 96 11 97 11 98 11 99 1 89 50 117 49 117 50 118 49 119 50 119 58 93 49 118 1 119 1 117 55 120 56 120 50 121 50 120 49 121 49 120 48 118 53 95 Preferred embodiments provide a TCR of the invention comprising: the alpha chain variable domain shown in the SEQ ID NO: 49 and the beta chain variable domain shown in the SEQ ID NO: 94, or phenotypically silent variants thereof. In another preferred embodiment TCRs of the invention comprising the variable domain combinations detailed above further comprise the alpha chain constant region amino acid sequence shown in FIG. 8a (SEQ ID NO: 100) and one of the beta chain amino acid constant region sequences shown in FIGS. 8b and 8c (SEQ ID NOs: 101 and 102) or phenotypically silent variants thereof. As used herein the term “phenotypically silent variants” is understood to refer to those TCRs which have a KD for the said SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex of less than or equal to 1 μM and/or have an off-rate (koff) of 1×10−3 S−1 or slower. For example, as is known to those skilled in the art, it may be possible to produce TCRs that incorporate minor changes in the constant and/or variable domains thereof compared to those detailed above without altering the affinity and/or off-rate for the interaction with the SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex. Such trivial variants are included in the scope of this invention. Those TCRs in which one or more conservative substitutions have been made also form part of this invention. In one broad aspect, the TCRs of the invention are in the form of either single chain TCRs (scTCRs) or dimeric TCRs (dTCRs) as described in WO 04/033685 and WO 03/020763. A suitable scTCR form comprises a first segment constituted by an amino acid sequence corresponding to a TCR α chain variable domain, a second segment constituted by an amino acid sequence corresponding to a TCR β chain variable domain sequence fused to the N terminus of an amino acid sequence corresponding to a TCR β chain constant domain extracellular sequence, and a linker sequence linking the C terminus of the first segment to the N terminus of the second segment. Alternatively the first segment may be constituted by an amino acid sequence corresponding to a TCR β chain variable domain, the second segment may be constituted by an amino acid sequence corresponding to a TCR α chain variable domain sequence fused to the N terminus of an amino acid sequence corresponding to a TCR α chain constant domain extracellular sequence The above scTCRs may further comprise a disulfide bond between the first and second chains, said disulfide bond being one which has no equivalent in native αβT cell receptors, and wherein the length of the linker sequence and the position of the disulfide bond being such that the variable domain sequences of the first and second segments are mutually orientated substantially as in native αβ T cell receptors. More specifically the first segment may be constituted by an amino acid sequence corresponding to a TCR α chain variable domain sequence fused to the N terminus of an amino acid sequence corresponding to a TCR α chain constant domain extracellular sequence, the second segment may be constituted by an amino acid sequence corresponding to a TCR β chain variable domain fused to the N terminus of an amino acid sequence corresponding to TCR β chain constant domain extracellular sequence, and a disulfide bond may be provided between the first and second chains, said disulfide bond being one which has no equivalent in native αβ T cell receptors. In the above scTCR forms, the linker sequence may link the C terminus of the first segment to the N terminus of the second segment, and may have the formula -PGGG-(SGGGG)n-P- wherein n is 5 or 6 and P is proline, G is glycine and S is serine. (SEQ ID NO: 103) -PGGG-SGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGG-P (SEQ ID NO: 104) -PGGG-SGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGG-P A suitable dTCR form of the TCRs of the present invention comprises a first polypeptide wherein a sequence corresponding to a TCR α chain variable domain sequence is fused to the N terminus of a sequence corresponding to a TCR α chain constant domain extracellular sequence, and a second polypeptide wherein a sequence corresponding to a TCR β chain variable domain sequence fused to the N terminus a sequence corresponding to a TCR β chain constant domain extracellular sequence, the first and second polypeptides being linked by a disulfide bond which has no equivalent in native αβ T cell receptors. The first polypeptide may comprise a TCR α chain variable domain sequence is fused to the N terminus of a sequence corresponding to a TCR α chain constant domain extracellular sequence, and a second polypeptide wherein a sequence corresponding to a TCR β chain variable domain sequence is fused to the N terminus a sequence corresponding to a TCR β chain constant domain extracellular sequence, the first and second polypeptides being linked by a disulfide bond between cysteine residues substituted for Thr 48 of exon 1 of TRAC*01 and Ser 57 of exon 1 of TRBC1*01 or TRBC2*01 or the non-human equivalent thereof. (“TRAC” etc. nomenclature herein as per T cell receptor Factsbook, (2001) LeFranc and LeFranc, Academic Press, ISBN 0-12-441352-8) The dTCR or scTCR form of the TCRs of the invention may have amino acid sequences corresponding to human αβ TCR extracellular constant and variable domain sequences, and a disulfide bond may link amino acid residues of the said constant domain sequences, which disulfide bond has no equivalent in native TCRs. The disulfide bond is between cysteine residues corresponding to amino acid residues whose β carbon atoms are less than 0.6 nm apart in native TCRs, for example between cysteine residues substituted for Thr 48 of exon 1 of TRAC*01 and Ser 57 of exon 1 of TRBC1*01 or TRBC2*01 or the non-human equivalent thereof. Other sites where cysteines can be introduced to form the disulfide bond are the following residues in exon 1 of TRAC*01 for the TCR α chain and TRBC1*01 or TRBC2*01 for the TCR β chain: Native β carbon TCR α chain TCR β chain separation (nm) Thr 45 Ser 77 0.533 Tyr 10 Ser 17 0.359 Thr 45 Asp 59 0.560 Ser 15 Glu 15 0.59 In addition to the non-native disulfide bond referred to above, the dTCR or scTCR form of the TCRs of the invention may include a disulfide bond between residues corresponding to those linked by a disulfide bond in native TCRs. The dTCR or scTCR form of the TCRs of the invention preferably does not contain a sequence corresponding to transmembrane or cytoplasmic sequences of native TCRs. Preferred embodiments of the invention provide a soluble TCR consisting of: the alpha chain amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 122 and beta chain amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 123: the alpha chain amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 122 and beta chain amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 124; SEQ ID NOs: 122, 123 and 124 have been provided in a form which includes the N-terminal methionine (M) and the N-terminal “K” and “NA” in the TCR alpha and beta chain sequences respectively. PEGylated TCR Monomers In one particular embodiment a TCR of the invention is associated with at least one polyalkylene glycol chain(s). This association may be cause in a number of ways known to those skilled in the art. In a preferred embodiment the polyalkylene chain(s) is/are covalently linked to the TCR. In a further embodiment the polyethylene glycol chains of the present aspect of the invention comprise at least two polyethylene repeating units. Multivalent TCR Complexes One aspect of the invention provides a multivalent TCR complex comprising at least two TCRs of the invention. In one embodiment of this aspect, at least two TCR molecules are linked via linker moieties to form multivalent complexes. Preferably the complexes are water soluble, so the linker moiety should be selected accordingly. Furthermore, it is preferable that the linker moiety should be capable of attachment to defined positions on the TCR molecules, so that the structural diversity of the complexes formed is minimised. One embodiment of the present aspect is provided by a TCR complex of the invention wherein the polymer chain or peptidic linker sequence extends between amino acid residues of each TCR which are not located in a variable region sequence of the TCR. Since the complexes of the invention may be for use in medicine, the linker moieties should be chosen with due regard to their pharmaceutical suitability, for example their immunogenicity. Examples of linker moieties which fulfil the above desirable criteria are known in the art, for example the art of linking antibody fragments. There are two classes of linker that are preferred for use in the production of multivalent TCR molecules of the present invention. A TCR complex of the invention in which the TCRs are linked by a polyalkylene glycol chain provides one embodiment of the present aspect. The first are hydrophilic polymers such as polyalkylene glycols. The most commonly used of this class are based on polyethylene glycol or PEG, the structure of which is shown below. [in-line-formulae]HOCH2CH2O(CH2CH2O)n—CH2CH2OH[/in-line-formulae] Wherein n is greater than two. However, others are based on other suitable, optionally substituted, polyalkylene glycols include polypropylene glycol, and copolymers of ethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Such polymers may be used to treat or conjugate therapeutic agents, particularly polypeptide or protein therapeutics, to achieve beneficial changes to the PK profile of the therapeutic, for example reduced renal clearance, improved plasma half-life, reduced immunogenicity, and improved solubility. Such improvements in the PK profile of the PEG-therapeutic conjugate are believe to result from the PEG molecule or molecules forming a ‘shell’ around the therapeutic which sterically hinders the reaction with the immune system and reduces proteolytic degradation. (Casey et al, (2000) Tumor Targetting 4 235-244) The size of the hydrophilic polymer used my in particular be selected on the basis of the intended therapeutic use of the TCR complex. Thus for example, where the product is intended to leave the circulation and penetrate tissue, for example for use in the treatment of a tumour, it may be advantageous to use low molecular weight polymers in the order of 5 KDa. There are numerous review papers and books that detail the use of PEG and similar molecules in pharmaceutical formulations. For example, see Harris (1992) Polyethylene Glycol Chemistry—Biotechnical and Biomedical Applications, Plenum, New York, N.Y. or Harris & Zalipsky (1997) Chemistry and Biological Applications of Polyethylene Glycol ACS Books, Washington, D.C. The polymer used can have a linear or branched conformation. Branched PEG molecules, or derivatives thereof, can be induced by the addition of branching moieties including glycerol and glycerol oligomers, pentaerythritol, sorbitol and lysine. Usually, the polymer will have a chemically reactive group or groups in its structure, for example at one or both termini, and/or on branches from the backbone, to enable the polymer to link to target sites in the TCR. This chemically reactive group or groups may be attached directly to the hydrophilic polymer, or there may be a spacer group/moiety between the hydrophilic polymer and the reactive chemistry as shown below: Reactive chemistry-Hydrophilic polymer-Reactive chemistryReactive chemistry-Spacer-Hydrophilic polymer-Spacer-Reactive chemistry The spacer used in the formation of constructs of the type outlined above may be any organic moiety that is a non-reactive, chemically stable, chain, Such spacers include, by are not limited to the following: [in-line-formulae]—(CH2)n— wherein n=2 to 5[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae]—(CH2)3NHCO(CH2)2 [/in-line-formulae] A TCR complex of the invention in which a divalent alkylene spacer radical is located between the polyalkylene glycol chain and its point of attachment to a TCR of the complex provides a further embodiment of the present aspect. A TCR complex of the invention in which the polyalkylene glycol chain comprises at least two polyethylene glycol repeating units provides a further embodiment of the present aspect. There are a number of commercial suppliers of hydrophilic polymers linked, directly or via a spacer, to reactive chemistries that may be of use in the present invention. These suppliers include Nektar Therapeutics (CA, USA), NOF Corporation (Japan), Sunbio (South Korea) and Enzon Pharmaceuticals (NJ, USA). Commercially available hydrophilic polymers linked, directly or via a spacer, to reactive chemistries that may be of use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, the following: PEG linker Catalogue Description Source of PEG Number TCR Monomer attachment 5K linear (Maleimide) Nektar 2D2MOHO1 20K linear (Maleimide) Nektar 2D2MOPO1 20K linear (Maleimide) NOF Corporation SUNBRIGHT ME-200MA 20K branched (Maleimide) NOF Corporation SUNBRIGHT GL2-200MA 30K linear (Maleimide) NOF Corporation SUNBRIGHT ME-300MA 40K branched PEG (Maleimide) Nektar 2D3XOTO1 5K-NP linear (for Lys attachment) NOF Corporation SUNBRIGHT MENP-50H 10K-NP linear (for Lys attachment) NOF Corporation SUNBRIGHT MENP-10T 20K-NP linear (for Lys attachment) NOF Corporation SUNBRIGHT MENP-20T TCR dimer linkers 3.4K linear (Maleimide) Nektar 2D2DOFO2 5K forked (Maleimide) Nektar 2D2DOHOF 10K linear (with orthopyridyl ds- linkers in place of Maleimide) Sunbio 20K forked (Maleimide) Nektar 2D2DOPOF 20K linear (Maleimide) NOF Corporation 40K forked (Maleimide) Nektar 2D3XOTOF Higher order TCR multimers 15K, 3 arms, Mal3 (for trimer) Nektar OJOONO3 20K, 4 arms, Mal4 (for tetramer) Nektar OJOOPO4 40K, 8 arms, Mal8 (for octamer) Nektar OJOOTO8 A wide variety of coupling chemistries can be used to couple polymer molecules to protein and peptide therapeutics. The choice of the most appropriate coupling chemistry is largely dependant on the desired coupling site. For example, the following coupling chemistries have been used attached to one or more of the termini of PEG molecules (Source: Nektar Molecular Engineering Catalogue 2003): N-maleimideVinyl sulfoneBenzotriazole carbonateSuccinimidyl proprionateSuccinimidyl butanoateThio-esterAcetaldehydesAcrylatesBiotinPrimary amines As stated above non-PEG based polymers also provide suitable linkers for multimerising the TCRs of the present invention. For example, moieties containing maleimide termini linked by aliphatic chains such as BMH and BMOE (Pierce, products Nos. 22330 and 22323) can be used. Peptidic linkers are the other class of TCR linkers. These linkers are comprised of chains of amino acids, and function to produce simple linkers or multimerisation domains onto which TCR molecules can be attached. The biotin/streptavidin system has previously been used to produce TCR tetramers (see WO/99/60119) for in-vitro binding studies. However, stepavidin is a microbially-derived polypeptide and as such not ideally suited to use in a therapeutic. A TCR complex of the invention in which the TCRs are linked by a peptidic linker derived from a human multimerisation domain provides a further embodiment of the present aspect. There are a number of human proteins that contain a multimerisation domain that could be used in the production of multivalent TCR complexes. For example the tetramerisation domain of p53 which has been utilised to produce tetramers of scFv antibody fragments which exhibited increased serum persistence and significantly reduced off-rate compared to the monomeric scFV fragment. (Willuda et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276 (17) 14385-14392) Haemoglobin also has a tetramerisation domain that could potentially be used for this kind of application. A multivalent TCR complex of the invention comprising at least two TCRs provides a final embodiment of this aspect, wherein at least one of said TCRs is associated with a therapeutic agent. In one aspect a TCR (or multivalent complex thereof) of the present invention may alternatively or additionally comprise a reactive cysteine at the C-terminal or N-terminal of the alpha or beta chains thereof. Diagnostic and Therapeutic Use In one aspect the TCR of the invention may be associated with a therapeutic agent or detectable moiety. For example, said therapeutic agent or detectable moiety may be covalently linked to the TCR. In one embodiment of the invention said therapeutic agent or detectable moiety is covalently linked to the C-terminus of one or both TCR chains. In one aspect the scTCR or one or both of the dTCR chains of TCRs of the present invention may be labelled with an detectable moiety, for example a label that is suitable for diagnostic purposes. Such labelled TCRs are useful in a method for detecting a SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex which method comprises contacting the TCR ligand with a TCR (or a multimeric high affinity TCR complex) which is specific for the TCR ligand; and detecting binding to the TCR ligand. In tetrameric TCR complexes formed for example, using biotinylated heterodimers, fluorescent streptavidin can be used to provide a detectable label. Such a fluorescently-labelled TCR tetramer is suitable for use in FACS analysis, for example to detect antigen presenting cells carrying the SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex for which these high affinity TCRs are specific. Another manner in which the soluble TCRs of the present invention may be detected is by the use of TCR-specific antibodies, in particular monoclonal antibodies. There are many commercially available anti-TCR antibodies, such as αF1 and βF1, which recognise the constant domains of the α and β chains, respectively. In a further aspect a TCR (or multivalent complex thereof) of the present invention may alternatively or additionally be associated with (e.g. covalently or otherwise linked to) a therapeutic agent which may be, for example, a toxic moiety for use in cell killing, or an immune effector molecule such as an interleukin or a cytokine. A multivalent TCR complex of the invention may have enhanced binding capability for a TCR ligand compared to a non-multimeric wild-type or T cell receptor heterodimer of the invention. Thus, the multivalent TCR complexes according to the invention are particularly useful for tracking or targeting cells presenting particular antigens in vitro or in vivo, and are also useful as intermediates for the production of further multivalent TCR complexes having such uses. These TCRs or multivalent TCR complexes may therefore be provided in a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation for use in vivo. The invention also provides a method for delivering a therapeutic agent to a target cell, which method comprises contacting potential target cells with a TCR or multivalent TCR complex in accordance with the invention under conditions to allow attachment of the TCR or multivalent TCR complex to the target cell, said TCR or multivalent TCR complex being specific for the SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex and having the therapeutic agent associated therewith. In particular, the soluble TCR or multivalent TCR complex of the present invention can be used to deliver therapeutic agents to the location of cells presenting a particular antigen. This would be useful in many situations and, in particular, against tumours. A therapeutic agent could be delivered such that it would exercise its effect locally but not only on the cell it binds to. Thus, one particular strategy envisages anti-tumour molecules linked to TCRs or multivalent TCR complexes according to the invention specific for tumour antigens. Many therapeutic agents could be employed for this use, for instance radioactive compounds, enzymes (perforin for example) or chemotherapeutic agents (cis-platin for example). To ensure that toxic effects are exercised in the desired location the toxin could be inside a liposome linked to streptavidin so that the compound is released slowly. This will prevent damaging effects during the transport in the body and ensure that the toxin has maximum effect after binding of the TCR to the relevant antigen presenting cells. Other suitable therapeutic agents include: small molecule cytotoxic agents, i.e. compounds with the ability to kill mammalian cells having a molecular weight of less than 700 daltons. Such compounds could also contain toxic metals capable of having a cytotoxic effect. Furthermore, it is to be understood that these small molecule cytotoxic agents also include pro-drugs, i.e. compounds that decay or are converted under physiological conditions to release cytotoxic agents. Examples of such agents include cis-platin, maytansine derivatives, rachelmycin, calicheamicin, docetaxel, etoposide, gemcitabine, ifosfamide, irinotecan, melphalan, mitoxantrone, sorfimer sodiumphotofrin II, temozolmide, topotecan, trimetreate glucuronate, auristatin E vincristine and doxorubicin;peptide cytotoxins, i.e. proteins or fragments thereof with the ability to kill mammalian cells. Including but not limited to, ricin, diphtheria toxin, pseudomonas bacterial exotoxin A, DNAase and RNAase;radio-nuclides, i.e. unstable isotopes of elements which decay with the concurrent emission of one or more of α or β particles, or γ rays. including but not limited to, iodine 131, rhenium 186, indium 111, yttrium 90, bismuth 210 and 213, actinium 225 and astatine 213; chelating agents may be used to facilitate the association of these radio-nuclides to the high affinity TCRs, or multimers thereof;prodrugs, including but not limited to, antibody directed enzyme pro-drugs;immuno-stimulants, i.e. moieties which stimulate immune response. Including but not limited to, cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN, Superantigens and mutants thereof, TCR-HLA fusions and chemokines such as IL-8, platelet factor 4, melanoma growth stimulatory protein, etc, antibodies or fragments thereof, complement activators, xenogeneic protein domains, allogeneic protein domains, viral/bacterial protein domains, viral/bacterial peptides and anti-T cell determinant antibodies (e.g. anti-CD3 or anti-CD28). Functional Antibody Fragments and Variants Antibody fragments and variants/analogues which are suitable for use in the compositions and methods described herein include, but are not limited to, the following. Antibody Fragments As is known to those skilled in the art, it is possible to produce fragments of a given antibody which retain substantially the same binding characteristics as those of the parent antibody. The following provides details of such fragments: Minibodies—These constructs consist of antibodies with a truncated Fc portion. As such they retain the complete binding domains of the antibody from which are derived. Fab fragments—These comprise a single immunoglobulin light chain covalently-linked to part of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. As such, Fab fragments comprise a single antigen combining site. Fab fragments are defined by the portion of an IgG that can be liberated by treatment with papain. Such fragments are commonly produced via recombinant DNA techniques. (Reeves et al., (2000) Lecture Notes on Immunology (4th Edition) Published by Blackwell Science) F(ab′)2 fragments—These comprise both antigen combining sites and the hinge region from a single antibody. F(ab′)2 fragments are defined by the portion of an IgG that can be liberated by treatment with pepsin. Such fragments are commonly produced via recombinant DNA techniques. (Reeves et al., (2000) Lecture Notes on Immunology (4th Edition) Published by Blackwell Science) Fv fragments—These comprise an immunoglobulin variable heavy domain linked to an immunoglobulin variable light domain. A number of Fv designs have been produced. These include dsFvs, in which the association between the two domains is enhanced by an introduced disulfide bond. Alternatively, scFVs can be formed using a peptide linker to bind the two domains together as a single polypeptide. Fvs constructs containing a variable domain of a heavy or light immunoglobulin chain associated to the variable and constant domain of the corresponding immunoglobulin heavy or light chain have also been produced. FV have also been multimerised to form diabodies and triabodies (Maynard et al., (2000) Annu Rev Biomed Eng 2 339-376) Nanobodies™—These constructs, marketed by Ablynx (Belgium), comprise synthetic single immunoglobulin variable heavy domain derived from a camelid (e.g. camel or llama) antibody. Domain Antibodies—These constructs, marketed by Domantis (Belgium), comprise an affinity matured single immunoglobulin variable heavy domain or immunoglobulin variable light domain. Antibody Variants and Analogues The defining functional characteristic of antibodies in the context of the present invention is their ability to bind specifically to a target ligand. As is known to those skilled in the art it is possible to engineer such binding characteristics into a range of other proteins. Examples of antibody variants and analogues suitable for use in the compositions and methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to, the following. Protein scaffold-based binding polypeptides—This family of binding constructs comprise mutated analogues of proteins which contain native binding loops. Examples include Affibodies, marketed by Affibody (Sweden), which are based on a three-helix motif derived from one of the IgG binding domains of Staphylococcus aureus Protein A. Another example is provided by Evibodies, marketed by EvoGenix (Australia) which are based on the extracellular domains of CTLA-4 into which domains similar to antibody binding loops are grafted. A final example, Cytokine Traps marketed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (US), graft cytokine receptor domains into antibody scaffolds. (Nygren et al., (2000) Current Opinion in Structural biology 7 463-469) provides a review of the uses of scaffolds for engineering novel binding sites in proteins. This review mentions the following proteins as sources of scaffolds: CP1 zinc finger, Tendamistat, Z domain (a protein A analogue), PST1, Coiled coils, LACI-D1 and cytochrome b562. Other protein scaffold studies have reported the use of Fibronectin, Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and ankyrin repeats. As is known to those skilled in the art antibodies or fragments, variants or analogues thereof can be produced which bind to various parts of a given protein ligand. For example, anti-CD3 antibodies can be raised to any of the polypeptide chains from which this complex is formed (i.e. γ, δ, ε, ζ, and η CD3 chains) Antibodies which bind to the ε CD3 chain are the preferred anti-CD3 antibodies for use in the compositions and methods of the present invention. Soluble TCRs or multivalent TCR complexes of the invention may be linked to an enzyme capable of converting a prodrug to a drug. This allows the prodrug to be converted to the drug only at the site where it is required (i.e. targeted by the sTCR). It is expected that the high affinity SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO: 125) (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 specific TCRs disclosed herein may be used in methods for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. For cancer treatment, the localisation in the vicinity of tumours or metastasis would enhance the effect of toxins or immunostimulants. For vaccine delivery, the vaccine antigen could be localised in the vicinity of antigen presenting cells, thus enhancing the efficacy of the antigen. The method can also be applied for imaging purposes. One embodiment is provided by an isolated cell presenting a TCR of the invention. For example, said cell may be a T cell. Further embodiments of the invention are provided by a pharmaceutical composition comprising: a TCR or a multivalent TCR complex of the invention (optionally associated with a therapeutic agent), or a plurality of cells presenting at least one TCR of the invention, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; The invention also provides a method of treatment of cancer comprising administering to a subject suffering such cancer disease an effective amount of a TCR or a multivalent TCR complex of the invention (optionally associated with a therapeutic agent), or a plurality of cells presenting at least one TCR of the invention. In a related embodiment the invention provides for the use of a TCR or a multivalent TCR complex of the invention (optionally associated with a therapeutic agent), or a plurality of cells presenting at least one TCR of the invention, in the preparation of a composition for the treatment of cancer. Therapeutic or imaging TCRs in accordance with the invention will usually be supplied as part of a sterile, pharmaceutical composition which will normally include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This pharmaceutical composition may be in any suitable form, (depending upon the desired method of administering it to a patient). It may be provided in unit dosage form, will generally be provided in a sealed container and may be provided as part of a kit. Such a kit would normally (although not necessarily) include instructions for use. It may include a plurality of said unit dosage forms. The pharmaceutical composition may be adapted for administration by any appropriate route, for example parenteral, transdermal or via inhalation, preferably a parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, or, most preferably intravenous) route. Such compositions may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example by admixing the active ingredient with the carrier(s) or excipient(s) under sterile conditions. Dosages of the substances of the present invention can vary between wide limits, depending upon the disease or disorder to be treated, the age and condition of the individual to be treated, etc. and a physician will ultimately determine appropriate dosages to be used. Additional Aspects A scTCR or dTCR (which preferably is constituted by constant and variable sequences corresponding to human sequences) of the present invention may be provided in substantially pure form, or as a purified or isolated preparation. For example, it may be provided in a form which is substantially free of other proteins. The invention also provides a method of producing a high affinity TCR having the property of binding to SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201. characterized in that the TCR (i) comprises at least one TCR α chain variable domain and/or at least one TCR β chain variable domain and (ii) has a KD for the said SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex of less than or equal to 1 μM and/or an off-rate (koff) for the SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex of 1×10−3 S−1 or slower, wherein the method comprises: (a) the production of a TCR comprising the α and β chain variable domains of the 1G4 TCR wherein one or both of the α and β chain variable domains comprise a mutation(s) in one or more of the amino acids identified in claims 7 and 8;(b) contacting said mutated TCR with SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 under conditions suitable to allow the binding of the TCR to SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201; and measuring the KD and/or koff of the interaction. Preferred features of each aspect of the invention are as for each of the other aspects mutatis mutandis.

EXAMPLE 1 Production of a Soluble Disulfide-Linked TCR Comprising the Native 1G4 TCR Variable Domain RNA Isolation Total RNA was isolated from 10000 clonal T cells by re-suspension in 100 μl tri-reagent (Sigma) and processing of the lysate according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the final precipitation the RNA was re-dissolved in 12.5 μl RNAse free water. cDNA Production To the above sample of RNA, 2.5 μl of 10 mM oligo-dT15 (Promega) was added and the sample incubated at 60° C. for 2 minutes then placed on ice. Reverse transcription was carried out using OmniscriptRT kit (Qiagen) by addition of 2 μl RT buffer (10×), 2 μl 5 mM dNTP, 1 μl Omniscript reverse transcriptase. The sample was mixed and incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. cDNA was then stored at −80° C. The above cDNA was used as template. A panel of forward primers covering all possible alpha and beta variable chains was used to screen for, and amplify by PCR, alpha and beta chains genes. Primer sequences used for TCR chain gene amplification were designed from the NCBI website using accession numbers obtained from the T cell receptor Factsbook, (2001) LeFranc and LeFranc, Academic Press, ISBN 0-12-441352-8. Alpha-chain forward primers were designed to contain a ClaI restriction site and the universal alpha chain reverse primer a SalI restriction site. Beta-chain forward primers were designed to contain a AseI restriction site and universal beta reverse primer an AgeI restriction site. Recipient vectors for the TCR gene fragments were based on a pGMT7 parent plasmid, which contains the T7 promoter for high level expression in E. coli strain BL21-DE3 (pLysS) (Pan et al., Biotechniques (2000) 29 (6): 1234-8) Alpha chain purified PCR products were digested with ClaI and SalII and ligated into pEX954 (see FIG. 9) cut with ClaI and XhoI. Beta chain purified PCR products were digested with AseI and AgeI and ligated into pEX821 (See FIG. 10) cut with NdeI/AgeI. Ligation The cut PCR product and cut vector were ligated using a rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche) following the manufacturers instructions. Ligated plasmids were transformed into competent E. coli strain XL1-blue cells and plated out on LB/agar plates containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin. Following incubation overnight at 37° C., single colonies were picked and grown in 10 ml LB containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin overnight at 37° C. with shaking. Cloned plasmids were purified using a Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and the insert was sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer (Lark Technologies). FIGS. 4 a and 4b show respectively the DNA sequence of soluble versions of the 1G4 TCR α and β chains mutated to include additional cysteine residues to form a non-native disulphide bond. FIGS. 5 a and 5b show respectively the NY-ESO TCR α and β chain extracellular amino acid sequences produced from the DNA sequences of FIGS. 4a and 4b EXAMPLE 2 Production of High Affinity Variants of the Soluble Disulfide Linked 1G4 TCR The soluble disulfide-linked native 1G4 TCR produced as described in Example 1 can be used a template from which to produce the TCRs of the invention which have an increased affinity for the SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex. The amino sequences of the mutated TCR alpha and beta chain variable domains which demonstrate high affinity for the SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex are listed in FIGS. 6 and 7 respectively. (SEQ ID Nos: 11-83 and 84-99 respectively) As is known to those skilled in the art the necessary codon changes required to produce these mutated chains can be introduced into the DNA encoding these chains by site-directed mutagenesis. (QuickChange™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene) Briefly, this is achieved by using primers that incorporate the desired codon change(s) and the plasmids containing the relevant 1G4 TCR chain as a template for the mutagenesis: Mutagenesis was carried out using the following conditions: 50 ng plasmid template, 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP, 5 μl of 10× Pfu DNA polymerase buffer as supplied by the manufacturer, 25 pmol of fwd primer, 25 pmol of rev primer, 1 μl pfu DNA polymerase in total volume 50 μl. After an initial denaturation step of 2 mins at 95 C, the reaction was subjected to 25 cycles of denaturation (95 C, 10 secs), annealing (55 C 10 secs), and elongation (72 C, 8 mins). The resulting product was digested with DpnI restriction enzyme to remove the template plasmid and transformed into E. coli strain XL1-blue. Mutagenesis was verified by sequencing. EXAMPLE 3 Production of Soluble “Zippered” High Affinity TCRs Alpha Chain—C-Jun Leucine Zipper The construct was made by PCR stitching. For the 5′-end of the gene the plasmid coding for the high affinity TCR alpha chains and containing the code for the introduced inter-chain di-sulfide bridge was used as template.

PCR with the following primer pair generated the desired constant domain. C-alpha fwd (SEQ ID NO: 107) CCAGAACCCTGACCCTGCCG 3′-alpha rev (SEQ ID NO: 108) aagcttcccgggggaactttctgggctggg The two products were mixed and diluted 1000 fold and 1 μl was used as template in a 50 μl PCR with 5′-TRAV21 fwd and 3′-alpha rev primers. The resulting PCR product was digested using restriction enzymes AseI and XmaI and ligated into pEX202 cut with NdeI and XmaI. PCRs were carried out using the following conditions: 50 pg plasmid template, 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP, 5 μl of 10× Pfu DNA polymerase buffer as supplied by the manufacturer, 25 pmol of fwd primer, 25 pmol of rev primer, 1 μl Pfu DNA polymerase in total volume 50 μl. After an initial denaturation step of 2 mins at 95 C, the reaction was subjected to 30 cycles of denaturation (95 C, 10 secs), annealing (55 C 10 secs), and elongation (72 C, 2 mins). Beta Chain—C-Fos Leucine Zipper The construct was made by PCR stitching. For the 5′-end of the gene plasmids coding for the high affinity TCR beta chains and containing the introduced inter-chain di-sulfide bridge were used as template. PCR with the following two primers generated the desired variable domain gene fragment.

PCR with the following two primers generated the desired constant domain gene fragment. C-beta fwd (SEQ ID NO: 111) GCTGTGTTTGAGCCATCAGAAG TRBC rev (SEQ ID NO: 112) aagcttcccggggtctgctctaccccaggc The two products were mixed and diluted 1000 fold and 1 μl was used as template in a 50 μl PCR with TRBV6-5 fwd and TRBC rev primers. PCRs were carried out as described above. The resulting PCR product was digested using restriction enzymes AseI and XmaI and ligated into pEX205 cut with NdeI and XmaI. EXAMPLE 4 Expression, Refolding and Purification of Soluble TCR The expression plasmids containing the mutated α-chain and β-chain respectively as prepared in Examples 1, 2 or 3 were transformed separately into E. coli strain BL21pLysS, and single ampicillin-resistant colonies were grown at 37° C. in TYP (ampicillin 100 μg/ml) medium to OD600 of 0.4 before inducing protein expression with 0.5 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested three hours post-induction by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 4000 rpm in a Beckman J-6B. Cell pellets were re-suspended in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCI, 25% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mM NaEDTA, 0.1% (w/v) NaAzide, 10 mM DTT, pH 8.0. After an overnight freeze-thaw step, re-suspended cells were sonicated in 1 minute bursts for a total of around 10 minutes in a Milsonix XL2020 sonicator using a standard 12 mm diameter probe. Inclusion body pellets were recovered by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 13000 rpm in a Beckman J2-21 centrifuge. Three detergent washes were then carried out to remove cell debris and membrane components. Each time the inclusion body pellet was homogenised in a Triton buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, 0.5% Triton-X100, 200 mM NaCI, 10 mM NaEDTA, 0.1% (w/v) NaAzide, 2 mM DTT, pH 8.0) before being pelleted by centrifugation for 15 minutes at 13000 rpm in a Beckman J2-21. Detergent and salt was then removed by a similar wash in the following buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM NaEDTA, 0.1% (w/v) NaAzide, 2 mM DTT, pH 8.0. Finally, the inclusion bodies were divided into 30 mg aliquots and frozen at −70° C. Inclusion body protein yield was quantitated by solubilising with 6M guanidine-HCl and measurement with a Bradford dye-binding assay (PerBio). Approximately 30 mg of TCR β chain and 60 mg of TCR α chain solubilised inclusion bodies were thawed from frozen stocks, samples were then mixed and the mixture diluted into 15 ml of a guanidine solution (6 M Guanidine-hydrochloride, 10 mM Sodium Acetate, 10 mM EDTA), to ensure complete chain de-naturation. The guanidine solution containing fully reduced and denatured TCR chains was then injected into 1 liter of the following refolding buffer: 100 mM Tris pH 8.5, 400 mM L-Arginine, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM reduced Glutathione, 0.5 mM oxidised Glutathione, 5M urea, 0.2 mM PMSF. The redox couple (2-mercaptoethylamine and cystamine (to final concentrations of 6.6 mM and 3.7 mM, respectively) were added approximately 5 minutes before addition of the denatured TCR chains. The solution was left for 5 hrs±15 minutes. The refolded TCR was dialysed in Spectrapor 1 membrane (Spectrum; Product No. 132670) against 10 L 10 mM Tris pH 8.1 at 5° C.±3° C. for 18-20 hours. After this time, the dialysis buffer was changed to fresh 10 mM Tris pH 8.1 (10 L) and dialysis was continued at 5° C.±3° C. for another 20-22 hours. sTCR was separated from degradation products and impurities by loading the dialysed refold onto a POROS 50HQ anion exchange column and eluting bound protein with a gradient of 0-500 mM NaCI over 50 column volumes using an Akta purifier (Pharmacia). Peak fractions were stored at 4° C. and analysed by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE before being pooled and concentrated. Finally, the sTCR was purified and characterised using a Superdex 200HR gel filtration column pre-equilibrated in HBS-EP buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM EDTA, 0.05% nonidet p40). The peak eluting at a relative molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa was pooled and concentrated prior to characterisation by BIAcore surface plasmon resonance analysis. EXAMPLE 5 Biacore Surface Plasmon Resonance Characterisation of sTCR Binding to Specific pMHC A surface plasmon resonance biosensor (Biacore 3000™) was used to analyse the binding of a sTCR to its peptide-MHC ligand. This was facilitated by producing single pMHC complexes (described below) which were immobilised to a streptavidin-coated binding surface in a semi-oriented fashion, allowing efficient testing of the binding of a soluble T-cell receptor to up to four different pMHC (immobilised on separate flow cells) simultaneously. Manual injection of HLA complex allows the precise level of immobilised class I molecules to be manipulated easily. Biotinylated class I HLA-A*0201 molecules were refolded in vitro from bacterially-expressed inclusion bodies containing the constituent subunit proteins and synthetic peptide, followed by purification and in vitro enzymatic biotinylation (O'Callaghan et al. (1999) Anal. Biochem. 266: 9-15). HLA-A*0201-heavy chain was expressed with a C-terminal biotinylation tag which replaces the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the protein in an appropriate construct. Inclusion body expression levels of ˜75 mg/liter bacterial culture were obtained. The MHC light-chain or β2-microglobulin was also expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli from an appropriate construct, at a level of ˜500 mg/liter bacterial culture. E. coli cells were lysed and inclusion bodies are purified to approximately 80% purity. Protein from inclusion bodies was denatured in 6 M guanidine-HCl, 50 mM Tris pH 8.1, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM EDTA, and was refolded at a concentration of 30 mg/liter heavy chain, 30 mg/liter β2m into 0.4 M L-Arginine-HCl, 100 mM Tris pH 8.1, 3.7 mM cystamine, mM cysteamine, 4 mg/ml of the SLLMWITQC peptide required to be loaded by the HLA-A*0201 molecule, by addition of a single pulse of denatured protein into refold buffer at <5° C. Refolding was allowed to reach completion at 4° C. for at least 1 hour. Buffer was exchanged by dialysis in 10 volumes of 10 mM Tris pH 8.1. Two changes of buffer were necessary to reduce the ionic strength of the solution sufficiently. The protein solution was then filtered through a 1.5 μm cellulose acetate filter and loaded onto a POROS 50HQ anion exchange column (8 ml bed volume). Protein was eluted with a linear 0-500 mM NaCl gradient. HLA-A*0201-peptide complex eluted at approximately 250 mM NaCl, and peak fractions were collected, a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Calbiochem) was added and the fractions were chilled on ice. Biotinylation tagged pMHC molecules were buffer exchanged into 10 mM Tris pH 8.1, 5 mM NaCl using a Pharmacia fast desalting column equilibrated in the same buffer. Immediately upon elution, the protein-containing fractions were chilled on ice and protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem) was added. Biotinylation reagents were then added: 1 mM biotin, 5 mM ATP (buffered to pH 8), 7.5 mM MgCl2, and 5 μg/ml BirA enzyme (purified according to O'Callaghan et al. (1999) Anal. Biochem. 266: 9-15). The mixture was then allowed to incubate at room temperature overnight. The biotinylated pHLA-A*0201 molecules were purified using gel filtration chromatography. A Pharmacia Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column was pre-equilibrated with filtered PBS and 1 ml of the biotinylation reaction mixture was loaded and the column was developed with PBS at 0.5 ml/min. Biotinylated pHLA-A*0201 molecules eluted as a single peak at approximately 15 ml. Fractions containing protein were pooled, chilled on ice, and protease inhibitor cocktail was added. Protein concentration was determined using a Coomassie-binding assay (PerBio) and aliquots of biotinylated pHLA-A*0201 molecules were stored frozen at −20° C. Streptavidin was immobilised by standard amine coupling methods. Such immobilised complexes are capable of binding both T-cell receptors and the coreceptor CD8αα, both of which may be injected in the soluble phase. Specific binding of TCR is obtained even at low concentrations (at least 40 μg/ml), implying the TCR is relatively stable. The pMHC binding properties of sTCR are observed to be qualitatively and quantitatively similar if sTCR is used either in the soluble or immobilised phase. This is an important control for partial activity of soluble species and also suggests that biotinylated pMHC complexes are biologically as active as non-biotinylated complexes. The interactions between 1G4 sTCR containing a novel inter-chain bond and its ligand/MHC complex or an irrelevant HLA-peptide combination, the production of which is described above, were analysed on a Biacore 3000™ surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. SPR measures changes in refractive index expressed in response units (RU) near a sensor surface within a small flow cell, a principle that can be used to detect receptor ligand interactions and to analyse their affinity and kinetic parameters. The probe flow cells were prepared by immobilising the individual HLA-peptide complexes in separate flow cells via binding between the biotin cross linked onto β2m and streptavidin which have been chemically cross linked to the activated surface of the flow cells. The assay was then performed by passing sTCR over the surfaces of the different flow cells at a constant flow rate, measuring the SPR response in doing so. To Measure Equilibrium Binding Constant Serial dilutions of WT 1G4 sTCR were prepared and injected at constant flow rate of 5 μl min-1 over two different flow cells; one coated with ˜1000 RU of specific SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex, the second coated with ˜1000 RU of non-specific HLA-A2-peptide complex. Response was normalised for each concentration using the measurement from the control cell. Normalised data response was plotted versus concentration of TCR sample and fitted to a hyperbola in order to calculate the equilibrium binding constant, KD. (Price & Dwek, Principles and Problems in Physical Chemistry for Biochemists (2nd Edition) 1979, Clarendon Press, Oxford). To Measure Kinetic Parameters For high affinity TCRs KD was determined by experimentally measuring the dissociation rate constant, kd, and the association rate constant, ka. The equilibrium constant KD) was calculated as kd/ka. TCR was injected over two different cells one coated with ˜300 RU of specific HLA-A2-nyeso peptide complex, the second coated with ˜300 RU of non-specific HLA-A2-peptide complex. Flow rate was set at 50 μl/min. Typically 250 μl of TCR at ˜3 μM concentration was injected. Buffer was then flowed over until the response had returned to baseline. Kinetic parameters were calculated using Biaevaluation software. The dissociation phase was also fitted to a single exponential decay equation enabling calculation of half-life. Results The interaction between a soluble disulfide-linked native 1G4 TCR (consisting of the α and β TCR chains detailed in SEQ ID NOs 9 and 10 respectively) and the SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 complex was analysed using the above methods and demonstrated a KD of 15 μM and a koff of 1.28×10−1 S−1. The TCRs specified in the following table have a KD of less than or equal to 1 μM and/or a koff of 1×10−3 S−1 or slower.

The NY-ESO-analogue SLLMWITQV (SEQ ID NO:127) peptide (V-variant peptide) was used as this peptide is known to have a higher affinity for the binding cleft of the HLA-A*0201 complex than the native NY-ESO-derived SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126) peptide. After pulsing, cells were washed in serum-free RPMI and 5×105 cells were incubated with high affinity c58c61 NY-ESO TCR-IL-2 fusion protein for 10 min at room temperature, followed by secondary anti-IL-2 mAb conjugated with PE (Serotec) for 15 min at room temperature. After washing, bound TCR-IL-2 was quantified by flow cytometry using a FACSVantage SE (Becton Dickinson). Controls, also using peptide-pulsed T2 cells were included where TCR-IL-2 was omitted. FIG. 14 a details the amino acid sequence of the alpha chain of the c58c61 NY-ESO TCR. (SEQ ID NO: 122). FIG. 14 c (SEQ ID NO: 124) details the amino acid sequence of the beta chain of the c58c61 NY-ESO TCR using the TRBC2 encoded constant region. FIG. 14 d (SEQ ID NO: 125) details the amino acid sequence of the beta chain of the c58c61 NY-ESO TCR using the TRBC2 encoded constant region fused via a peptide linker to wild-type human IL-2. The alpha and beta chain variable domain mutations contained within the soluble c58c61 1G4 TCR-IL-2 fusion protein correspond to those detailed in SEQ ID NO: 49 and SEQ ID NO: 94 respectively. Note that SEQ ID NOs: 121-125 have been provided in a form which includes the N-terminal methionine (M) and the “K” and “NA” residues omitted in the majority of the other TCR alpha chain and beta chain amino acid sequences. In similar experiments SK-MEL-37, ScaBER, J82, HcT119 and Colo 205 cancer cells transfected with a NY-ESO-derived SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126) peptide expressing ubiquitin minigene construct were used.

Fifty female nude mice (HARLAN, France) were used in this trial. All animals were injected subcutaneously with the human melanoma tumour-forming cell line (SK-MEL-37) which had been stably transfected with a NY-ESO peptide/ubiquitin minigene construct in ensure enhanced expression of the appropriate class I-peptide target at the cell surface. Tumors were allowed to grow in the animals for 5 days to allow tumour development prior to commencement of treatment. The rats then received the following i.v. bolus dosage of c58c61 high affinity NY-ESO TCR/IL-2 fusion protein: Doses ranged between 0.02 and 1.0 mg/kg high affinity 1G4 TCR/IL-2 fusion proteins in PBS, administered at 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 13, 17, 20, 24, 28, and 30 day post-tumor engraftment. In all experiments, a control treatment group was included where PBS alone was substituted for the TCR/IL-2 immunoconjugate. Tumor size was then measured using callipers and tumor volume determined according to the following formula (W2×L)/2, where W=the smallest diameter of the tumor, and L=is the longest diameter. Results The therapeutic effect of the TCR/IL-2 immunoconjugates in terms of tumor growth inhibition is shown in FIG. 21. Conclusions The TCR/IL-2 immunoconjugate exhibited a clear dose-dependent anti-tumor effect as shown by the tumour growth curves depicted in FIG. 21. EXAMPLE 12 Quantification of Cell Surface TCR Ligands by Fluorescence Microscopy Using High Affinity c58c61 1G4 TCR The number of SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 antigens on cancer cells (Mel 526, Mel 624 and SK-Mel-37 cell lines) was determined (on the assumption that one fluorescence signal relates to a single labelled TCR bound to its cognate pMHC ligand on the surface of the target cell) by single molecule fluorescence microscopy using the high-affinity c58c61 1G4 TCR. This was facilitated by using biotinylated TCR to target the antigen-expressing cancer cells and subsequent labelling of cell-bound TCR by streptavidin-R phycoerythrin (PE) conjugates. Individual PE molecules were then imaged by 3-dimensional fluorescence microscopy. Staining of Adherent Cells. The cancer cells were plated into chamber well slides and allowed to adhere overnight in incubator. (37° C., 5% CO2) Media was removed and replaced with fresh R10. Media was removed, and cells washed twice with 500 μl of PBS supplemented with 400 μM MgCl2 (PBS/Mg). Cells were incubated in 200 μl of TCR solution (5 μg ml−1 high affinity c58c61 1G4 TCR, or 5 μg ml−1 of an “irrelevant” HLA-A2-tax peptide-specific high affinity TCR, in PBS/Mg containing 0.5% BSA albumin) for 30 min at 4° C. TCR solution was removed, and cells were washed three times with 500 μl of PBS/Mg. Cells were incubated in 200 μl of streptavidin-PE solution (5 μg ml−1 streptavidin-PE in PBS/Mg containing 0.5% BSA) at room temperature in the dark for 20 min. Streptavidin-PE solution was removed and cells were washed five times with 500 μl of PBS/Mg. Wash media was removed, and cells kept in 400 μl of imaging media before imaging by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence Microscopy. Fluorescent microscopy was carried out using an Axiovert 200M (Zeiss) microscope with a 63× Oil objective (Zeiss). A Lambda LS light source containing a 300 W Xenon Arc lamp (Sutter) was used for illumination, and light intensity was reduced to optimal levels by placing a 0.3 and a 0.6 neutral density filter into the light path. Excitation and emission spectra were separated using a TRITC/DiI filter set (Chroma). Cells were imaged in three dimensions by z-stack acquisition (21 planes, 1 μm apart). Image acquisition and analysis was performed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging) as described (Irvine et al., Nature (419), p 845-9, and Purbhoo et al., Nature Immunology (5), p 524-30). Results As demonstrated by FIG. 22 the above method was used successfully to image high affinity 1G4 TCR bound to SLLMWITQC (SEQ ID NO:126)-HLA-A*0201 antigens on the surface of Mel 526, Mel 624 and SK-Mel-37 cancer cells. 1.
