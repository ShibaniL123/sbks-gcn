ADAPTERS FOR USE BETWEEN SURGICAL HANDLE ASSEMBLY AND SURGICAL END EFFECTOR Technical Field [0001] The present disclosure relates to adapters used for surgical devices and/or systems. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to adapters and/or adapter assemblies for use between and for interconnecting a powered, rotating and/or articulating surgical device or handle assembly and an effector for clamping, cutting and/or stapling tissue. Background [0002] A number of surgical device manufacturers have developed product lines with proprietary drive systems for operating and/or manipulating the surgical device. In many instances the surgical devices include a handle assembly, which is reusable, and a disposable end effector or the like that is selectively connected to the handle assembly prior to use and then disconnected from the end effector following use in order to be disposed of or in some instances sterilized for re-use. [0003] Many of the existing end effectors for use with many of the existing surgical devices and/or handle assemblies are driven by a linear force. For example, end effectors for performing endo-gastrointestinal anastomosis procedures, end-to-end anastomosis procedures and transverse anastomosis procedures, each typically require a linear driving force in order to be operated. As such, these end effectors are not compatible with surgical devices and/or handle assemblies that use a rotary motion to deliver power or the like. [0004] In order to make the linear driven end effectors compatible with surgical devices and/or handle assemblies that use a rotary motion to deliver power, a need exists for adapters and/or adapter assemblies to interface between and interconnect the linear driven end effectors with the rotary driven surgical devices and/or handle assemblies. Object of the Invention [0005] It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome or at least ameliorate one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to at least provide a useful alternative. AH26(8856871_1):TCW Summary of the Invention [0006] There is disclosed herein an electromechanical surgical system, comprising: a hand-held surgical device, including: a device housing defining a connecting portion; at least one drive motor supported in the device housing and being configured to rotate a first drive shaft of the surgical device; a battery disposed within the device housing for powering the at least one drive motor; and a circuit board disposed within the device housing for controlling power delivered from the battery to the at least one drive motor; an end effector configured to perform at least one function, the end effector including at least one axially translatable drive member; and an adapter assembly for selectively interconnecting the end effector and the surgical device, the adapter assembly including: an adapter housing configured and adapted for selective connection to the connecting portion of the surgical device and to be in operative communication with the first drive shaft of the surgical device; an outer tube having a proximal end supported by the adapter housing and a distal end configured and adapted for connection with the end effector, wherein the distal end of the outer tube is in operative communication with each of the at least one axially translatable drive member of the end effector; and a first drive converter assembly including: a first distal drive shaft rotatably supported in the adapter housing, wherein a proximal end of the first distal drive shaft is connectable to the rotatable drive shaft of the surgical device; a drive coupling nut threadably connected to a threaded distal portion of the first distal drive shaft, wherein the drive coupling nut is keyed against rotation within the adapter housing; and a drive tube having a proximal end connected to the drive coupling nut and a distal end configured for selective engagement with the at least one axially translatable drive member of the end effector; wherein rotation of the rotatable drive shaft of the surgical device results in rotation of the distal drive shaft, and wherein rotation of the distal drive shaft results in axial translation of the (10531787 1): MSD drive coupling nut, the drive tube and the at least one axially translatable drive member of the end effector.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS [0077] Embodiments of the presently disclosed adapter assemblies for surgical devices and/or handle assemblies are described in detail with reference to the drawings, in which like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding elements in each of the several views. As used herein the term “distal” refers to that portion of the adapter assembly or surgical device, or component thereof, farther from the user, while the term “proximal” refers to that portion of the adapter assembly or surgical device, or component thereof, closer to the user. [0078] Referring initially to FIGS. 1 and 1Α, an adapter assembly in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure is shown and generally designated 100. As seen in FIGS. 1 and 1Α, adapter assembly 100 is shown connected to or otherwise supported on a surgical device 10, here shown as a hand held powered surgical driver or the like. Reference may be made to International Application No. PCT/US2008/077249, filed September 22, 2008 (Inter. Pub. No. WO 2009/039506), the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference, for a detailed description of the construction and operation of exemplary surgical devices 10, for use with adapter assembly 100. Surgical devices 10 may include a housing, at least one drive motor, at least one energy source for powering the at least one drive motor, and at least one rotatable drive shaft connected to the drive motor. [00791 In accordance with the present disclosure, surgical device 10 includes a first and a second drive motor, and a first and a second rotatable drive member or shaft, respectively connected to the first and second drive motors. In use, as the first drive motor is activated, the first drive motor will cause the first drive shaft to selectively rotate along its axis in either a first or clock-wise direction, or in a second or counter clock-wise direction. Additionally, as the second drive motor is activated, the second drive motor will cause the second drive shaft to selectively rotate along its axis in either a first or clock-wise direction, or in a second or counter clock-wise direction. [0080] As seen in FIG. 1Α, adapter assembly 100 is configured and adapted to operatively interconnect and couple any one of a number of end effectors to surgical device 10. For example, adapter assembly 100 is configured and adapted to operatively interconnect and couple an endo-gastrointestinal anastomosis end effector 20, an end-to-end anastomosis end effector 30 or a transverse anastomosis end effector 40 to surgical device 10. An adapter may be provided for connecting a right angled linear cutter/stapler end effector 50, as seen in FIG. 36, to surgical device 10, as needed and/or desired. [0081] Reference may be made to U.S Patent Publication No. 2009/0145947, filed January 14, 2009, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference for a detailed discussion of the construction and operation of the endo-gastrointestinal anastomosis end effector 20. [0082] Reference may be made to U.S Patent Publication No. 2009/0179063, filed March 20, 2009, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference for a detailed discussion of the construction and operation of the end-to-end anastomosis end effector 30. [0083] Reference may be made to U.S Patent No. 6,817,508, issued November 16, 2004, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference for a detailed discussion of the construction and operation of the transverse anastomosis end effector 40. [0084] Reference may be made to U.S Patent Publication No. 2003/0130677, filed March 8, 2002, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference for a detailed discussion of the construction and operation of the right angled linear cutter/stapler end effector 50 (see FIG. 36). [0085] Each of end effectors 20, 30 and 40 includes at least one axially translatable drive member therein that is configured and adapted to at least one of open and close the jaw assemblies by approximating or separating the anvil assembly and the cartridge assembly to/away from one another, and to fire the end effector to expel staples contained in the cartridge assembly for formation against the anvil assembly and possibly to actuate a knife blade along the staple line. Each of end effectors 20, 30 and 40 may further include an axially translatable drive member therein that is configured and adapted to cause an articulation of end effector 20, 30 and/or 40. [0086| Meanwhile end effector 50 includes at least one rotatably drive member therein that is configured and adapted to at least one of open and close the jaw assemblies by approximating or separating the anvil assembly and the cartridge assembly to/away from one another, and to fire the end effector to expel staples contained in the cartridge assembly for formation against the anvil assembly and possibly to actuate a knife blade along the staple line. (0087] With continued reference to FIGS. 1 and 1Α, and with reference to FIGS. 2-17, a detailed description of the construction and operation of adapter assembly 100 is provided. Adapter assembly 100 includes a knob housing 102 configured and adapted to connect to a nose of surgical device 10. Knob housing 102 includes a release button 104 that is actuatable to disconnect adapter assembly 100 from surgical device 10. Knob housing 102 may be formed in a pair of housing halves, namely an upper housing half 102a and a lower housing half 102b. Adapter assembly 100 further includes an outer tube 106 extending from a distal end of knob housing 102. Knob housing 102 and outer tube 106 are configured and dimensioned to house the components of adapter assembly 100. Outer tube 106 may be dimensioned such that outer tube may pass through a typical trocar port, cannula or the like. [0088] As seen in FIGS. 2 and 5-7, adapter assembly 100 includes a surgical device drive coupling assembly 110. Drive coupling assembly 110 includes a distal drive coupling housing 112 rotatably supporting a first and a second proximal drive shaft 114, 116, respectively. Each proximal drive shaft 114, 116 includes a proximal portion 114a, 116a having a shaped or non-circular transverse cross-sectional profile. Drive coupling assembly 110 includes a first and a second coupling sleeve 118, 120, respectively, that is connected to, and extend proximally from, respective proximal portions 114a, 116a of proximal drive shafts 114, 116. Drive coupling assembly 110 includes a proximal drive coupling housing 122 configured to rotatably support first and second coupling sleeves 118, 120. Each of first and second coupling sleeves 118, 120 is configured to mate with a distal end of respective first and second drive shafts (not shown) of surgical device 10. [0089J As seen in FIGS. 5-7, drive coupling assembly 110 includes a first and a second spring 124, 126 disposed about respective first and second proximal drive shafts 114, 116, and disposed distally of first and second coupling sleeves 118, 120. First and second springs 124, 126 act on first and second coupling sleeves 118, 120 to help maintain coupling sleeves 118, 120 engaged with the distal end of respective first and second drive shafts (not shown) of surgical device 10 when adapter assembly 100 is connected to surgical device 10. [0090] First and second springs 124, 126 function to bias respective first and second coupling sleeves 118, 120 in a proximal direction. In this manner, during assembly of adapter assembly 100 to surgical device 10, if first and second sleeves 118, 120 are misaligned with the driving shafts of surgical device 10, first and/or second spring(s) 124, 126 are compressed. Thus, when the drive motor of surgical device 10 is engaged, the driving shaft of surgical device 10 will rotate and first and/or second spring(s) 124, 126 will cause respective first and/or second coupling sleeve 118, 120 to slide back proximally, effectively coupling the drive rods of surgical device 10 to first and/or second proximal drive shaft(s) 114, 116 of drive coupling assembly 110. [0091] Turning now to FIGS. 2-5 and 8, adapter assembly 100 includes a first and a second drive converter assembly 140, 150, respectively. Each drive converter assembly 140, 150 is configured and adapted to convert a rotation of a respective first and second drive shaft (not shown) of surgical device 10, and concomitant rotation of respective first and second proximal drive shafts 114, 116, into axial translation of respective drive members or the like of adapter assembly 100. [0092J As seen in FIGS. 2-5 and 8, adapter assembly 100 includes a lower housing half 130 and an upper housing half 132 disposed within outer tube 106. A proximal end of housing halves 130, 132 is supported in a distal end of knob housing 102 and is spaced an axial distance from drive coupling assembly 110. A distal end of housing halves 130, 132 may be configured and adapted to selectively engage and couple with a proximal end of any of the end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40. It is contemplated that the distal end of housing halves 130, 132 may be configured to receive the proximal end of any of the end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 is a bayonet-type configuration or coupling, or any other coupling known by one having skill in the art. [0093] Adapter assembly 100 includes a first flexible drive cable 134 having a proximal end 134a connected to a distal portion of first proximal drive shaft 114, and a second flexible drive cable 136 having a proximal end 136a connected to a distal portion of second proximal drive shaft 116. In this manner, as either of first and/or second proximal drive shafts 114, 116 is/are rotated, the rotation is transmitted to respective first and/or second flexible drive cables 134, 136. Use of flexible drive cables allows for a radial shifting of an axis of rotation of first and/or second proximal drive shafts 114, 116. [0094] As seen in FIG. 8, a distal end 134b of first flexible drive cable 134 is connected to first drive converter assembly 140, and a distal end 136b of second drive cable 136 is connected to second drive converter assembly 150. [0095] First drive converter assembly 140 includes a proximal coupling 142 connected to distal end 134b of first flexible drive cable 134 and rotatably supported between lower housing half 130 and upper housing half 132, a tubular sleeve 144 connected to proximal coupling 142 and rotatably supported between lower housing half 130 and upper housing half 132, and a distal coupling nut 146 connected to a distal end of tubular sleeve 144 and rotatably supported between lower housing half 130 and upper housing half 132. Each of proximal coupling 142, tubular sleeve 144 and coupling nut 146 may be rotatably supported between lower housing half 130 and upper housing half 132 by any number of appropriately positioned and sized bearings and/or bushings (not numbered). [0096] As seen in FIGS. 8 and 10, first drive converter assembly 140 further includes a drive shaft 148 translatably supported for axial reciprocation between lower housing half 130 and upper housing half 132. Drive shaft 148 includes a threaded proximal end portion 148a threadably coupled to coupling nut 146 and a distal end portion 148b extending from a distal end of lower housing half 130, upper housing half 132, and outer tube 106. Distal end portion 148b of drive shaft 148 defines a connection member 148c configured and adapted for selective engagement with an axially translatable drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40. [0097] In operation, as seen in FIGS. 16 and 17, as coupling nut 146 is rotated (in the direction of arrow “A”) due to a rotation of tubular sleeve 144, proximal coupling 142, first flexible drive cable 132 and the first proximal drive shaft 114, as a result of the rotation of the first drive shaft of surgical device 10, drive shaft 148 is caused to be translated axially (in the direction of arrow “B”) relative to coupling nut 146. Accordingly, as drive shaft 148 is translated axially, with connection member 148c thereof connected to a drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40, drive shaft 148 causes concomitant axial translation of the drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 to effectuate an operation and/or function thereof, such as, for example, the firing of the end effector or the like. [0098] With reference to FIGS. 2-4 and 8, second drive converter assembly 150 includes a drive shaft 152 rotatably supported between lower housing half 130 and upper housing half 132. Drive shaft 152 includes a proximal end portion 152a having a flange 152c extending radially therefrom in order to fix an axial position of drive shaft 152 relative to lower housing half 130 and upper housing half 132. Proximal end portion 152a of drive shaft 152 is coupled to second flexible drive cable 136. Drive shaft 152 further includes a threaded distal portion 152b. [0099] Second drive converter assembly 150 further includes a drive bar 154 translatably supported for axial translation between lower housing half 130 and upper housing half 132. Drive bar 154 includes a threaded proximal end portion 154a threadably coupled to threaded distal portion 152b of drive shaft 152, and a distal end portion 154b defining a coupling hook 154c or the like. [00100] In operation, as seen in FIGS. 14 and 15, as drive shaft 152 is rotated (in the direction of arrow “C”) due to a rotation of second flexible drive cable 136 and of second proximal drive shaft 116, as a result of the rotation of the second drive shaft of surgical device 10, drive bar 154 is caused to be translated axially (in the direction of arrow “B”) relative to drive shaft 152. Accordingly, as drive bar 154 is translated axially, with hook 154c thereof connected to a drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40, drive bar 154 causes concomitant axial translation of the drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 to effectuate an operation and/or function thereof, such as, for example, articulation of the end effector, the firing of a knife blade or the like. [00101] With reference to FIGS. 2, 3 and 8-11, adapter assembly 100 further includes a lock mechanism 160 configured and adapted to fix the axial position and radial orientation of drive shaft 148 for the connection and disconnection of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 thereto. Lock mechanism 160 includes a button or lever 162 slidably supported on knob housing 102. Lock button 162 is connected to an actuation bar 164 that extends longitudinally through outer tube 106. Actuation bar 164 is interposed between outer tube 106 and lower housing half 130 and upper housing half 132. Actuation bar 164 is configured and dimensioned such that movement of lock button 162 results in movement of actuation bar 164. Actuation bar 164 includes a distal portion 164a defining a window 164b therein. As seen in FIG. 10, a distal end of window 164b defines a cam surface 164c. [00102J Lock mechanism 160 further includes a lock arm 166 supported on upper housing half 132 at a location in registration with window 164b of distal portion 164a of actuation bar 164. Lock arm 166 includes a tab 166a extending toward drive shaft 148. Tab 166a of lock arm 166 is configured and dimensioned to selectively engage a cut-out 148d formed in drive shaft 148. Lock mechanism 160 further includes a biasing member 168 tending to maintain lock arm 166 and tab 166a thereof spaced away from drive shaft 148. [00103] In operation, in order to lock the position and/or orientation of drive shaft 148, a user moves lock button 162 from a distal position to a proximal position, thereby causing cam surface 164c of actuation bar 164 to engage lock arm 166 and urge lock arm 166 toward drive shaft 148, against the bias of biasing member 168, such that tab 166a of lock arm 166 is received in cut-out 148d of drive shaft 148. In this manner, drive shaft 148 is prevented from distal and/or proximal movement. When lock button 162 is moved from the proximal position to the distal position, cam surface 164c is disengaged from lock arm 166 thereby allowing biasing member 168 to urge lock arm 166 and tab 166a thereof out of cut-out 148d of drive shaft 148. [00104] It is contemplated that lock mechanism 160 may include a biasing member 170 tending to maintain lock button 162 and actuation bar 164 in the distal position. [00105] Turning now to FIGS. 18-34, an adapter assembly, configured and adapted to operatively interconnect and couple any one of a number of end effectors to surgical device 10, in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, is generally designated as adapter assembly 200. [00106] Adapter assembly 200 includes a knob housing 202 configured and adapted to connect to a nose of surgical device 10. Adapter assembly 200 further includes an outer tube 206 extending from a distal end of knob housing 202. Knob housing 202 and outer tube 206 are configured and dimensioned to house the components of adapter assembly 200. Outer tube 206 may be dimensioned such that outer tube may pass through a typical trocar port, cannula or the like. [00107] As seen in FIGS. 20 and 23-27, adapter assembly 200 includes a surgical device drive coupling assembly 210. Drive coupling assembly 210 includes a distal drive coupling housing 212 rotatably supported in knob housing 202. Drive coupling assembly 210 includes a proximal drive coupling housing 222 configured to rotatably support first and second coupling sleeves 218, 220. Each of first and second coupling sleeves 218, 220 is configured to mate with a distal end of respective first and second drive shafts (not shown) of surgical device 10. It is contemplated that drive coupling assembly 210 includes a first and a second biasing member (not shown) disposed distally of first and second coupling sleeves 218, 220 to act on first and second coupling sleeves 218, 220 to help maintain coupling sleeves 218, 220 engaged with the distal end of respective first and second drive shafts (not shown) of surgical device 10 when adapter assembly 200 is connected to surgical device 10. [00108] Turning now to FIGS. 20-27, adapter assembly 200 includes a first and a second drive converter assembly 240, 250, respectively (see FIG. 23). Each drive converter assembly 240, 250 is configured and adapted to convert a rotation of a respective first and second drive shaft (not shown) of surgical device 10 into axial translation of respective drive members or the like of adapter assembly 200. [00109] As seen in FIGS. 18-27, adapter assembly 200 includes a proximal tubular housing 230 disposed within outer tube 206, and a distal housing 232 disposed at least partially within a distal portion of outer tube 206. Proximal tubular housing 230 defines a longitudinally extending slot 230a fonned along a length thereof. A proximal end of proximal tubular housing 230 extends through knob housing 202 and is supported in a distal end of distal drive coupling housing 212 of drive coupling assembly 210. A distal end of distal housing 232 may be configured and adapted to selectively engage and couple with a proximal end of any of the end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40. It is contemplated that the distal end of distal housing 232 may be configured to receive the proximal end of any of the end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 is a bayonet-type configuration or coupling, or any other coupling known by one having skill in the art. [00110] As seen in FIGS. 20-27, first drive converter assembly 240 includes a first drive shaft 242 rotatably supported within proximal tubular housing 230. First drive shaft 242 includes a non-circular or shaped proximal end portion 242a configured for connection with first coupling sleeve 218 which is connected to the distal end of a first drive shaft (not shown) of surgical device 10. First drive shaft 242 further includes a distal end portion 242b having a threaded outer profile or surface. [001111 First drive converter assembly 240 further includes a drive coupling nut 244 rotatably coupled to threaded distal end portion 242a of first drive shaft 242, and which is slidably disposed within longitudinal slot 230a of proximal housing portion 230. Drive coupling nut 244 is shaped so as to not rotate within longitudinal slot 230a of proximal housing portion 230 as first drive shaft 242 is rotated. In this manner, as first drive shaft 242 is rotated, drive coupling nut 244 is translated through and/or along longitudinal slot 230a of proximal housing portion 230. [00112] First drive converter assembly 240 further includes a first drive bar 246 having a proximal end portion 246a connected to drive coupling nut 244 and a distal end portion 246b extending through distal housing 232. Distal end portion 246b of first drive bar 246 defines a connection member 246c configured and adapted for selective engagement with an axially translatable drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40. [001131 In operation, as seen in FIGS. 24-29, as first drive shaft 242 is rotated (in the direction of arrow “A”) due to a rotation of first coupling sleeve 218, as a result of the rotation of the first drive shaft of surgical device 10, drive coupling nut 244 is caused to be translated axially through longitudinal slot 230a of proximal housing portion 230. As drive coupling nut 244 is caused to be translated axially through longitudinal slot 230a of proximal housing portion 230, first drive bar 246 is caused to be translated axially (in the direction of arrow “B”) relative to distal housing portion 232. Accordingly, as drive bar 246 is translated axially, with connection member 246c thereof connected to a drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40, drive bar 246 causes concomitant axial translation of the drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 to effectuate an operation and/or function thereof, such as, for example, the firing of the end effector or the like. [00114J With reference to FIGS. 18-27, second drive converter assembly 250 includes a second drive shaft 252 rotatably supported within drive coupling assembly 210. Second drive shaft 252 includes a non-circular or shaped proximal end portion 252a configured for connection with second coupling sleeve 220 which is connected to the distal end of a second drive shaft (not shown) of surgical device 10. Second drive shaft 252 further includes a distal end portion 252b having a threaded outer profile or surface. [00115] Second drive converter assembly 250 further includes a coupling cuff 254 rotatably and translatably supported within an annular race or recess 202a formed in knob housing 202. Coupling cuff 254 defines a lumen 254a therethrough, and an annular race or recess 254b formed in a surface of lumen 254a. Second drive converter assembly 250 further includes a coupling slider 256 extending across lumen 254a of coupling cuff 254 and slidably disposed within race 254b of coupling cuff 254a. Coupling slider 256 is threadably connected to threaded distal end portion 252b of second drive shaft 252. As so configured, coupling cuff 254 may rotate about second drive shaft 252, thereby maintaining a radial position of second drive shaft 252 relative to first drive shaft 242 and the like. [00116] Second drive shaft 252 defines an axis of rotation, and coupling cuff 254 defines an axis of rotation that is spaced a radial distance from the axis of rotation of second drive shaft 252. Coupling slider 256 defines an axis of rotation that is coincident with the axis of rotation of coupling cuff 254. (00117| Second drive converter assembly 250 farther includes a drive bar 258 translatably supported for axial translation through outer tube 206. Drive bar 258 includes a proximal end portion 258a coupled to coupling cuff 254, and a distal end portion 258b defining a coupling hook 258c or the like. (00118] Second drive converter assembly 250 further includes a tab or rib 259 projecting from coupling cuff 254 that is translatably disposed within a longitudinally extending groove 202b formed in knob housing 202. (00119] In operation, as seen in FIGS. 24-27 and 30-34, as drive shaft 252 is rotated (in the direction of arrow “C”) due to a rotation of second coupling sleeve 220, as a result of the rotation of the first drive shaft of surgical device 10, coupling slider 256 is caused to be translated axially which in turn causes coupling cuff 254 to be translated axially relative to knob housing 202. As coupling cuff 254 is translated axially, drive bar 258 is caused to be translated axially (in the direction of arrow “B”). Accordingly, as drive bar 258 is translated axially, with hook 258c thereof connected to a drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40, drive bar 258 causes concomitant axial translation of the drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 to effectuate an operation and/or function thereof, such as, for example, articulation of the end effector, the firing of a knife blade or the like. (00120] Also, in operation, since tab 259 of coupling cuff 254 is translatably disposed within a longitudinally extending groove 202b formed in knob housing 202, as knob housing 202 is rotated about a longitudinal axis, tab 259 and drive bar 258 are caused to be rotated about the longitudinal axis. As such, any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 connected to adapter assembly 200 is also caused to be rotated about the longitudinal axis. [00121] With reference to FIGS. 23-27, it is contemplated that adapter assembly 200 may include a lock mechanism 260 whose construction and operation is substantially similar to lock mechanism 160 of adapter assembly 100. [00122] Lock mechanism 260 includes a lock/release collar 262 translatably supported on knob housing 202 and that is actuatable to fix the axial position and radial orientation of a first drive shaft 246 for the connection and disconnection of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 thereto. Lock/release collar 262 is connected to an actuation bar 264 that extends longitudinally through outer tube 206. Actuation bar 264 is interposed between outer tube 206 and proximal housing portion 230 and distal housing portion 232. A connecting member, in the form of a pin or the like (not shown), interconnects Iock/release collar 262 and actuation bar 264. The connecting member extends through a slot formed in knob housing 202 and a slot formed in outer tube 206. Actuation bar 264 is configured and dimensioned such that movement of lock/release collar 262 results in movement of actuation bar 264. [00123] Actuation bar 264 includes a distal portion 264a that is configured and adapted to function in a manner substantially similar to distal portion 164a of actuation bar 164 of lock mechanism 160, described above. Accordingly, reference may be made to lock mechanism 160 for a detailed discussion of the construction and operation of distal portion 264a of actuation bar 264 of lock mechanism 260. (00124J Similar to lock mechanism 160, lock mechanism 260 further includes a lock arm supported on the distal housing portion at a location in registration with a window formed in distal portion 264a of actuation bar 264. The lock arm includes a tab extending toward drive shaft 246. The tab of the lock aim is configured and dimensioned to selectively engage a cut-out 246d formed in drive shaft 246 (see FIGS. 20, 23, 26 and 28-29). Lock mechanism 260 further includes a biasing member tending to maintain the lock arm and the tab thereof spaced away from drive shaft 246. [00125] In operation, in order to lock the position and/or orientation of drive shaft 246, a user moves lock/release collar 262 from a distal position to a proximal position, thereby causing the cam surface of actuation bar 264 to engage the lock arm and urge the lock arm toward drive shaft 246, against the bias of the biasing member, such that the tab of the lock arm is received in cut-out 246d of drive shaft 246. In this manner, drive shaft 246 is prevented from distal and/or proximal movement. When lock/release collar 262 is moved from the proximal position to the distal position, the cam surface is disengaged from the lock arm thereby allowing the biasing member to urge the lock arm and the tab thereof out of cut-out 246d of drive shaft 246. (00126J Turning now to FIG. 35, an adapter assembly 300, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, is shown connected to or supported on a distal end of surgical device 10. As seen in FIG. 35, adapter assembly 300 includes a first and a second drive converter assembly 340, 350, respectively. Each drive converter assembly 340, 350 is configured and adapted to convert a rotation of a respective first and second drive shaft 12, 14 of surgical device 10, into axial translation of respective drive members or the like of adapter assembly 300. (00127j First drive converter assembly 340 includes a proximal coupling 342 configured for selective connection to a distal end 12a of drive shaft 12, a gear system 344 connected to proximal coupling 342 and rotatably supported within a housing of adapter assembly 300, a distal coupling nut 346 connected to a distal end of gear system 344 and rotatably supported on a threaded portion of a first drive shaft 348. [00128] First drive shaft 348 is supported for axial reciprocation within the housing of adapter assembly. First drive shaft 348 includes a threaded proximal end portion threadabiy coupled to coupling nut 346 and a distal end portion extending from a distal end of the housing of adapter assembly 300. The distal end portion of first drive shaft 348 defines a connection member configured and adapted for selective engagement with an axially translatable drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40. [00129] In operation, as coupling nut 346 is rotated due to a rotation of gearing system 344 and first drive shaft 12 of surgical device 10, first drive shaft 348 is caused to be translated axially relative to coupling nut 346. Accordingly, as first drive shaft 348 is translated axially, with the distal connection member thereof connected to a drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40, first drive shaft 348 causes concomitant axial translation of the drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 to effectuate an operation and/or function thereof, such as, for example, the firing of the end effector or the like. [00130] Second drive converter assembly 350 includes a proximal coupling 352 configured for selective connection to a distal end 14a of drive shaft 14, a gear system 354 connected to proximal coupling 352 and rotatably supported within a housing of adapter assembly 300, a distal coupling member 356 connected to a distal end of gear system 354 and rotatably supported on a threaded portion of a second drive shaft 358. [00131] Second drive shaft 358 is supported for axial translation within the housing of adapter assembly. Second drive shaft 358 includes a threaded proximal end portion threadabiy coupled to coupling member 356 and a distal end portion extending through the housing of adapter assembly 300. The distal end portion of second drive shaft 358 defines a connection member configured and adapted for selective engagement with an axially translatable drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40. [00132] In operation, as coupling member 356 is rotated due to a rotation of gearing system 354 and second drive shaft 14 of surgical device 10, second drive shaft 358 is caused to be translated axially relative to coupling member 356. Accordingly, as drive shaft 348 is translated axially, with the distal connection member thereof connected to a drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40, second drive shaft 358 causes concomitant axial translation of the drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 to effectuate an operation and/or function thereof, such as, for example, the firing of the end effector or the like. [00133J As seen in FIG. 35, adapter assembly 300 includes a distal recognition sensor 370 supported near a distal end of outer tube 306 or the like. Distal recognition sensor 370 is configured and adapted to identify and/or recognize the end effectors that are attached to the distal end of adapter assembly 300. [00134| Adapter assembly 300 may further include a proximal recognition sensor 372 supported near a proximal end of adapter assembly 300. Proximal recognition sensor 372 may be in communication with distal recognition sensor 370, to thereby transmit the identity and/or recognition parameters of the end effectors that are attached to the distal end of adapter assembly 300, to a sensor or monitor 376 supported in surgical device 10. [00135] In accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, as seen in FIG. 36, it is contemplated that an adapter assembly may be provided that includes a first rotatable drive shaft and a second rotatable drive shaft, wherein each of the first and second rotatable drive shafts is configured and dimensioned to operatively interconnect a respective first and second rotatable drive shaft of surgical device 10 to a respective first and second rotatable drive member of end effector 50. [00136] Turning now to FIGS. 37-51, an adapter assembly, configured and adapted to operatively interconnect and couple any one of a number of end effectors to surgical device 10, in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, is generally designated as ad apter assem b 1 y 400. [00137) Adapter assembly 400 includes a knob housing 402 configured and adapted to connect to a nose of surgical device 10. Adapter assembly 400 further includes an outer tube 406 extending from a distal end of knob housing 402. Knob housing 402 and outer tube 406 are configured and dimensioned to house the components of adapter assembly 400. Outer tube 406 may be dimensioned such that outer tube may pass through a typical trocar port, cannula or the like. [00138] As seen in FIGS. 37, 39-41 and 43-51, adapter assembly 400 includes a surgical device drive coupling assembly 410. Drive coupling assembly 410 includes a distal drive coupling housing 412 and a proximal drive coupling housing 422 rotatably supported in knob housing 402. Drive coupling assembly 410 rotatably supports a first and a second rotatable proximal drive shaft 414 and 415, respectively (see FIGS. 45-48), and a third rotatable proximal drive shaft 416 (see FIGS. 40, 47 and 48) therein. [00139] Drive coupling housing 422 is configured to rotatably support first, second and third coupling sleeves 418, 419 and 420, respectively. Each of coupling sleeves 418-420 is configured to mate with a distal end of respective first, second and third drive shafts (not shown) of surgical device 10. Each of coupling sleeves 418-420 is further configured to mate with a proximal end of respective first, second and third proximal drive shafts 414, 415 and 416. [00140] It is contemplated that drive coupling assembly 410 includes a first, a second and a third biasing member 424, 425 and 426 disposed distally of respective first, second and coupling sleeves 418-420. Each of biasing members 424, 425 and 426 is disposed about respective first, second and third rotatable proximal drive shaft 414, 415 and 416. Biasing members 424-426 act on respective coupling sleeves 418-420 to help maintain coupling sleeves 418-420 engaged with the distal end of respective drive shafts (not shown) of surgical device 10 when adapter assembly 400 is connected to surgical device 10. [00141] In particular, first, second and third biasing members 424, 425 and 426 function to bias respective coupling sleeves 418, 419 and 420 in a proximal direction. In this manner, during assembly of adapter assembly 400 to surgical device 10, if first, second and or third coupling sleeves 418, 419 and/or 420 is/are misaligned with the driving shafts of surgical device 10, first, second and/or third biasing member(s) 424, 425 and/or 426 are compressed. Thus, when the drive motor of surgical device 10 is engaged, the driving shaft of surgical device 10 will rotate and first, second and/or third biasing member(s) 424, 425 and/or 426 will cause respective first, second and/or third coupling sleeve(s) 418, 419 and/or 420 to slide back proximally, effectively coupling the drive rods of surgical device 10 to first, second and/or third proximal drive shaft(s) 414, 415 and 416 of drive coupling assembly 410. [00142] Adapter assembly 400 includes a first, a second and a third drive converter assembly 440, 450, 460, respectively. Each drive converter assembly 440, 450, 460 is configured and adapted to convert a rotation of a respective first, second and third drive shaft (not shown) of surgical device 10 into axial translation of respective drive members or the like of adapter assembly 400. (00143] As seen in FIGS. 39, 40 and 42, adapter assembly 400 includes a proximal tubular housing 430 rotatably and slidably disposed within proximal outer tube 407, and a distal housing 432 disposed at least partially within outer tube 406. Proximal tubular housing 430 defines a longitudinally extending lumen 430a formed therethrough. Proximal tubular housing 430 receives a distal end of distal drive coupling housing 412 of drive coupling assembly 410. A distal end of distal housing 432 may be configured and adapted to selectively engage and couple with a proximal end of any of the end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40. It is contemplated that the distal end of distal housing 432 may be configured to receive the proximal end of any of the end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 is a bayonet-type configuration or coupling, or any other coupling known by one having skill in the art. [00144] As seen in FIGS. 42-47, first drive converter assembly 440 includes a first distal drive shaft 442 rotatably supported within proximal tubular housing 430 and distal housing 432. First distal drive shaft 442 includes a spur gear 442a supported on a proximal end thereof which is configured for connection to a spur gear 414a of first rotatable proximal drive shaft 414. First distal drive shaft 442 further includes a distal end portion 442b having a threaded outer profile or surface. [00145] First drive converter assembly 440 further includes a drive coupling nut 444 rotatably coupled to threaded distal end portion 442a of first distal drive shaft 442, and which is slidably disposed within proximal tubular housing 430 and distal housing 432. Drive coupling nut 444 is prevented from rotation as first distal drive shaft 442 is rotated. In this manner, as first distal drive shaft 442 is rotated, drive coupling nut 444 is translated through and/or along proximal tubular housing 430 and distal housing 432. [00146} First drive converter assembly 440 further includes a drive tube 446 surrounding first distal drive shaft 442 and having a proximal end portion 446a connected to drive coupling nut 444 and a distal end portion 446b extending beyond a distal end of first distal drive shaft 442. Distal end portion 446b of drive tube 446 supports a connection member 447 configured and dimensioned for selective engagement with an axially translatable drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40. [00147J In operation, as first rotatable proximal drive shaft 414 is rotated, due to a rotation of first coupling sleeve 418, as a result of the rotation of the first drive shaft of surgical device 10, spur gear 4I4a of first rotatable proximal drive shaft 414 engages spur gear 442a of first distal drive shaft 442 thereby causing first distal drive shaft 442 to rotate. As first distal drive shaft 442 is rotated, drive coupling nut 444 is caused to be translated axially along first distal drive shaft 442. [00148] As drive coupling nut 444 is caused to be translated axially along first distal drive shaft 442, drive tube 446 is caused to be translated axially relative to distal housing portion 432. Accordingly, as drive tube 446 is translated axially, with connection member 447 connected thereto and connected to a drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40, drive tube 446 causes concomitant axial translation of the drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 to effectuate an operation and/or function thereof, such as, for example, the firing of the end effector or the like. [00149| With reference to FIGS. 39, 40 and 42-47, second drive converter assembly 450 includes a second distal drive shaft 452 rotatably supported within distal housing 432. Second distal drive shaft 452 includes a proximal end portion 452a connected to proximal tubular housing 430. Second distal drive shaft 452 further includes a distal end portion 452b configured and dimensioned for selective engagement with an axially translatable drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40. [00150] Second drive converter assembly 450 further includes a coupling nut 454 rotatably supported within an annular race or recess 430a formed in proximal tubular housing 430 (see FIG. 47). Coupling nut 454 is threadably connected to a threaded distal end portion 415b of second rotatable proximal drive shaft 415. In this manner, as second rotatable proximal drive shaft 415 is rotated, coupling nut 454 is translated relative to second rotatable proximal drive shaft 415 thereby causing proximal tubular housing 430 to also translate. [00151| In operation, as second rotatable proximal drive shaft 415 is rotated, due to a rotation of second coupling sleeve 419, as a result of the rotation of the second drive shaft of surgical device 10, coupling nut 454 is caused to be translated axially along second rotatable proximal drive shaft 415. [00152] As coupling nut 454 is caused to be translated axially along second rotatable proximal drive shaft 415, proximal tubular housing 430 to also caused to be translated axially relative to distal housing portion 432. Accordingly, as proximal tubular housing 430 is translated axially, second distal drive shaft 452 is caused to be translated axially. In this manner, with distal end portion 452b thereof connected to a drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40, second distal drive shaft 452 causes concomitant axial translation of the drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 to effectuate an operation and/or function thereof, such as, for example, the firing of the end effector or the like. [00153] With reference to FIGS. 39 and 45, third drive converter assembly 460 includes a ring gear 462 connected to an inner surface of proximal outer tube 407 and extending radially therearound. Third drive converter assembly 460 further includes a spur gear 416a supported on third rotatable proximal drive shaft 416 and which is configured and located for mating engagement with ring gear 462. [00154] In operation, as third rotatable proximal drive shaft 416 is rotated, due to a rotation of third coupling sleeve 420, as a result of the rotation of the third drive shaft of surgical device 10, spur gear 416a of third rotatable proximal drive shaft 416 engages ring gear 462 thereby causing ring gear 462 to rotate. As ring gear 462 is rotated, ring gear 462 causes proximal outer tube 407 to rotate. As proximal outer tube 407 is rotated, distal outer tube 406 is also rotated and so too is any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 that may be coupled thereto. [00155] As seen in FIGS. 50 and 51, adapter assembly 400 may include at least one electrical contact 476, in the form of a pin, for electrical connection to a corresponding plug of the surgical device 10. As seen in FIG. 51, adapter assembly 400 may further include at least one conductive, optical, magnetic or radio-frequency identification device 478 for electrical connection to a corresponding plug of the surgical device 10. [00156] Turning now to FIGS. 52-66, an adapter assembly, configured and adapted to operatively interconnect and couple any one of a number of end effectors (here, end effector 20 being shown) to surgical device 10, in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure, is generally designated as adapter assembly 500. [00157| Adapter assembly 500 includes a knob housing 502 configured and adapted to connect to a nose of surgical device 10. Adapter assembly 500 further includes an outer tube 506 extending from a distal end of knob housing 502. Knob housing 502 and outer tube 506 are configured and dimensioned to house the components of adapter assembly 500. Outer tube 506 may be dimensioned such that outer tube 506 may pass through a typical trocar port, cannula or the like. [00158] As seen in FIGS. 58-60 and 64-65, adapter assembly 500 includes a surgical device drive coupling assembly 510. Drive coupling assembly 510 includes a distal drive coupling housing 512 and a proximal drive coupling housing 522 rotatably supported in knob housing 502. Drive coupling assembly 510 rotatably supports a first rotatable proximal drive shaft 514, a second rotatable proximal drive shaft 515, and a third rotatable proximal drive shaft 516 therein. [00159] Proximal drive coupling housing 522 is configured to rotatably support first, second and third coupling sleeves 518, 519 and 520, respectively. Each of coupling sleeves 518-520 is configured to mate with a distal end of respective first, second and third drive shafts (not shown) of surgical device 10. Each of coupling sleeves 518-520 is further configured to mate with a proximal end of respective first, second and third proximal drive shafts 514, 515 and 516. [00160] It is contemplated that proximal drive coupling assembly 510 includes a first, a second and a third biasing member 524, 525 and 526 disposed distally of respective first, second and third coupling sleeves 518-520. Each of biasing members 524, 525 and 526 is disposed about respective first, second and third rotatable proximal drive shaft 514, 515 and 516. Biasing members 524, 525 and 526 act on respective coupling sleeves 518, 519 and 520 to help maintain coupling sleeves 518, 519 and 520 engaged with the distal end of respective drive shafts (not shown) of surgical device 10 when adapter assembly 500 is connected to surgical device 10. [00161| In particular, first, second and third biasing members 524, 525 and 526 function to bias respective coupling sleeves 518, 519 and 520 in a proximal direction. In this manner, during assembly of adapter assembly 500 to surgical device 10, if first, second and or third coupling sleeves 518, 519 and/or 520 is/are misaligned with the driving shafts of surgical device 10, first, second and/or third biasing member(s) 524, 525 and/or 526 are compressed. Thus, when the drive motor of surgical device 10 is engaged, the driving shaft of surgical device 10 will rotate and first, second and/or third biasing member(s) 524, 525 and/or 526 will cause respective first, second and/or third coupling sleeve(s) 518, 519 and/or 520 to slide back proximally, effectively coupling the drive rods of surgical device 10 to first, second and/or third proximal drive shaft(s) 514, 515 and 516 of proximal drive coupling assembly 5 10. [00162| In addition, each of coupling sleeves 518, 519 and 520 is biased or spring-loaded, such that if one or more of coupling sleeves 518, 519 and 520 is/are misaligned with respect to the corresponding with the driving shafts of surgical device 10, while adapter assembly 500 is mated to surgical device 10, biasing members) 524, 525 and 526, biasing respective coupling sleeves 518, 519 and 520 proximally, compress and the respective coupling sleeves 518, 519 and 520 is/are allowed to move distally. Upon calibration of surgical device 10, each of the driving shafts of surgical device 10 is rotated and the bias on the coupling sleeves 518, 519 and 520 properly seats the coupling sleeves 518, 519 and 520 over the respective driving shaft of surgical device 10 when the proper alignment is reached. [00163] Adapter assembly 500 includes a first, a second and a third drive converter assembly 540, 550, 560, respectively. Each drive converter assembly 540, 550, 560 is configured and adapted to convert a rotation of a respective first, second and third drive shaft (not shown) of surgical device 10 into axial translation of respective drive members or the like of adapter assembly 500. (00164] As seen in FIGS. 60, 61 and 63-65, first drive converter assembly 540 includes a first distal drive shaft 542 rotatably supported within housing 502 and outer tube 506. A proximal end of first distal drive shaft 542 is keyed to a spur gear 542a which is configured for connection to a spur gear 514a of first rotatable proximal drive shaft 514. First distal drive shaft 542 further includes a distal end portion 542b having a threaded outer profile or surface. (00165) First drive converter assembly 540 further includes a drive coupling nut 544 rotatably coupled to threaded distal end portion 542b of first distal drive shaft 542, and which is slidably disposed within outer tube 506. Drive coupling nut 544 is keyed to outer tube 506 or the like so as to be prevented from rotation as first distal drive shaft 542 is rotated. In this manner, as first distal drive shaft 542 is rotated, drive coupling nut 544 is translated through and/or along outer tube 506. (00166) First drive converter assembly 540 further includes a drive tube 546 surrounding first distal drive shaft 542 and having a proximal end portion connected to drive coupling nut 544 and a distal end portion extending beyond a distal end of first distal drive shaft 542. The distal end portion of drive tube 546 supports a connection member 547 (see FIGS. 54-57) configured and dimensioned for selective engagement with an axially translatable drive member of end effector 20. [00167] In operation, as first rotatable proximal drive shaft 514 is rotated, due to a rotation of first coupling sleeve 518, as a result of the rotation of the first drive shaft of surgical device 10, spur gear 514a of first rotatable proximal drive shaft 514 engages first gear 545a of compound gear 545 causing compound gear 545 to rotate. As compound gear 545 rotates, a second gear 545b of compound gear 545 is rotated and thus causes spur gear 542a of first distal drive shaft 542 that is engaged therewith to also rotate thereby causing first distal drive shaft 542 to rotate. As first distal drive shaft 542 is rotated, drive coupling nut 544 is caused to be translated axially along first distal drive shaft 542. [00168J As drive coupling nut 544 is caused to be translated axially along first distal drive shaft 542, drive tube 546 is caused to be translated axially relative to outer tube 506 of adapter assembly 500. Accordingly, as drive tube 546 is translated axially, with connection member 547 connected thereto and connected to a drive member of end effector 20, drive tube 546 causes concomitant axial translation of the drive member of end effector 20 to effectuate an operation and/or function thereof, such as, for example, the firing of the end effector or the like. [00169] As seen in FIGS. 58-60 and 63-66, adapter assembly 500 includes a transmission assembly 580 having a proximal transmission plate 582 disposed distally of distal drive coupling housing 512 and a distal transmission plate 584 disposed distally of proximal transmission plate 582. Proximal transmission plate 582 and distal transmission plate 584 are located at a fixed spaced axial distance from one another. Each of first, second and third proximal drive shafts 514, 515 and 516 extend into transmission assembly 580. Proximal transmission plate 582 defines an annular array of distally oriented, bi-directional gear teeth 582a. [00170] Since the amount of torque required to provide anti-rotation to drive coupling nut 544 is relatively high, in the present embodiment, a lock assembly, clutch assembly or the like 590 is provided to inhibit rotation of outer tube 506 of adapter assembly 500 and of the end effector 20 when relatively large forces are encountered in the end effector 20. [00171J As seen in FIGS. 58-60 and 63-66, clutch assembly 590 includes a rotation coupler 592, in the form of a plate or ring, interposed between proximal transmission plate 582 and distal transmission plate 584. Rotation coupler 592 defines an annular array of proximally oriented, bi-directional gear teeth 592a configured and dimensioned to engage the annular array of distally oriented, bi-directional gear teeth 582a of proximal transmission plate 582. Gear teeth 592a of rotation coupler 592 are arranged in two spaced apart halves defining recesses 592b therebetween. Clutch assembly 590 includes biasing members 594 interposed between rotation coupler 592 and distal transmission plate 584 for providing positive bias to rotation coupler 592 to ensure that gear teeth 592a of rotation coupler 592 remained locked or engaged with gear teeth 582a of proximal transmission plate 582. [00172J Clutch assembly 590 further includes an internal rotation ring gear 596 interposed between proximal transmission plate 582 and rotation coupler 592. Ring gear 596 defines an internal array of gear teeth 596a. Ring gear 596 includes a pair of diametrically opposed, radially extending protrusions 596b projecting form an outer edge thereof. Ring gear 596 further includes cam surfaces 596c configured to engage respective cam surfaces 592c of rotation coupler 592. [00173J In operation, as ring gear 596 is rotated an initial 20° relative to rotation coupler 592, gear teeth 592a of rotation coupler 592 are caused to be separated from gear teeth 582a of proximal transmission plate 582 due to the camming interaction of cam surfaces 596c of ring gear 596 with cam slots 592c of rotation coupler 592. Following the first 20° of rotation, protrusion 596b or ring gear 596 is in abutment with the end wall of recess 592b of rotation coupler 592. Then, as ring gear 596 is rotated an additional 5°, protrusion 596b of ring gear 596 pushes against the end wall of recess 592b of rotation coupler 592, which is connected to housing 502, to rotate thereby causing housing 502 of adapter assembly 500 and thus end effector 20 to rotate. Rotation coupler 592 is keyed to housing 502 thereby transmitting rotation thereof to housing 502 and on to outer tube 506 and end effector 20. [00174J Rotation of ring gear 596 is accomplished through rotation of third rotatable proximal drive shaft 516 and actuation of third drive converter assembly 560. In particular, as third rotatable proximal drive shaft 516 is rotated, due to a rotation of third coupling sleeve 520, as a result of the rotation of the third drive shaft of surgical device 10, spur gear 516a of third rotatable proximal drive shaft 516 engages an intermediate spur gear 562 of third drive converter assembly 560. As intermediate spur gear 562 is rotated, rotation is transmitted to ring gear 596. [00175] As mentioned above, as ring gear 596 is rotated, ring gear 596 interacts with rotation coupler 592 to cause rotation coupler 592 to rotate and to transmit rotation to housing 502, outer tube 506 and end effector 20. [00176] With reference to FIGS. 60, 61 and 63-65, second drive converter assembly 550 includes a second distal drive shaft 552 supported within housing 502 and outer tube 506 of adapter 500. Second distal drive shaft 552 includes a proximal end portion 552a connected to an articulation link 554. Second distal drive shaft 552 further includes a distal end portion configured and dimensioned for selective engagement with an axially translatable drive member of end effector 20. Articulation link 554 defines a lip 554a configured for receipt in an annular groove 556a of a coupling nut 556. This arrangement enables articulation link 554 to rotate t around coupling nut 556 and still be able to transmit axial movement as a result of the rotation of threaded distal end portion 515b of proximal drive shaft 515. Second drive converter assembly 550 may include an inner ring 557a configured to keep articulation link 554 constrained to or connected to coupling nut 556. Second drive converter assembly 550 may further include an outer ring 557b at least partially surrounding inner ring 557a and rotatably connected thereto via complementary annular rings and grooves thereby allowing relative rotation with respect to one another and still providing axial linear movement. (00177) Second drive converter assembly 550 further includes a coupling nut 556 rotatably supported within an annular race or recess formed in housing 502. Coupling nut 556 is threadably connected to a threaded distal end portion 515b of second rotatable proximal drive shaft 515. In this manner, as second rotatable proximal drive shaft 515 is rotated, coupling nut 556 is translated relative to second rotatable proximal drive shaft 515 thereby causing articulation link 554 and second distal drive shaft 552 to also translate. (00178] In operation, as second rotatable proximal drive shaft 515 is rotated, due to a rotation of second coupling sleeve 519, as a result of the rotation of the second drive shaft of surgical device 10, coupling nut 554 is caused to be translated axially along second rotatable proximal drive shaft 515. (00179) As coupling nut 554 is caused to be translated axially along second rotatable proximal drive shaft 515, second distal drive shaft 552 is caused to be translated axially. In this manner, with a distal end portion of second distal drive shaft 552 connected to a drive member of end effector 20, second distal drive shaft 552 causes concomitant axial translation of the drive member of end effector 20 to effectuate an operation and/or function thereof, such as, for example, an articulation of end effector 20. [00180] As seen in FIGS. 62 and 64, adapter assembly 500 may include at least one electrical contact 576, in the form of a pin, for electrical connection to a corresponding plug of the surgical device 10. (00181) As seen in FIGS. 56, 57 and 59, adapter assembly 500 includes a lock mechanism substantially similar to lock mechanism 160 of adapter assembly 100 and thus will only be discussed in detail herein to the extent necessary to describe differences in construction and operation thereof. [00182] The lock mechanism of adapter assembly 500 includes a button or lever 562 slidably supported on knob housing 502 for fixing the axial position and radial orientation of drive tube 546 for the connection and disconnection of end effector 20 thereto. [00183] Turning now to FIGS. 67-69, an adapter assembly 600, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, is shown connected to or supported on a distal end of surgical device 10. As seen in FIG. 67, adapter assembly 600 includes a first and a second drive converter assembly 640, 650, respectively. Each drive converter assembly 640, 650 is configured and adapted to convert a rotation of a respective first and second drive shaft 12, 14 of surgical device 10, into axial translation of respective drive members or the like of adapter assembly 600. [00184] As seen in FIGS. 67 and 68, adapter assembly 600 includes a nested gear set 660 having an inner gear 662 and an outer gear 664. Inner gear 662 includes a proximal spur gear 662a and a distal spur gear 662b spaced from one another along a tubular body 662c that is rotatably supported on/in a bearing 662℮. Tubular body 662c defines a lumen 662d therethrough. Outer gear 664 includes a proximal spur gear 664a and a distal spur gear 664b spaced from one another along a shaft body 664c that rotatably extends through lumen 662d of inner gear 662. Proximal spur gear 664a and distal spur gear 664b of outer gear 664 are disposed proximally and distally of respective proximal spur gear 662a and distal spur gear 662b of inner gear 662. f00185j First drive converter assembly 640 includes a proximal coupling 642 configured for selective connection to a distal end of drive shaft 12, a slip clutch system 644 connected to proximal coupling 642 and rotatably supported within a housing of adapter assembly 600, and an input drive shaft 645 supporting a spur gear 645a thereon (see FIG. 68) operatively connected to slip clutch system 644 and actuatable thereby. (00186J First drive converter assembly 640 further includes inner gear 662 of nested gear set 660. In particular, spur gear 645a of input drive shaft 645 is engaged with proximal spur gear 662a of inner gear 662. First drive converter assembly 640 further includes an output drive shaft 646 supporting a proximal spur gear 646a that is threadably engaged with distal spur gear 662b of inner gear 662 and supporting a distal spur gear 646b that is threadably engaged with a threaded proximal end portion 648a of first drive shaft 648. [00187] First drive shaft 648 is supported for axial reciprocation within the housing of adapter assembly. First drive shaft 648 includes a threaded proximal end portion 648a threadably coupled to distal spur gear 646b of output drive shaft 646 and a distal end portion extending from a distal end of the housing of adapter assembly 600. The distal end portion of first drive shaft 648 defines a connection member configured and adapted for selective engagement with an axially translatable drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40. [00188J In operation, as inner gear 662 is rotated due to a rotation of input drive shaft 645 and first drive shaft 12 of surgical device 10, first drive shaft 648 is caused to be translated axially relative to distal spur gear 646b of output drive shaft 646. Accordingly, as first drive shaft 648 is translated axially, with the distal connection member thereof connected to a drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40, first drive shaft 648 causes concomitant axial translation of the drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 to effectuate an operation and/or function thereof, such as, for example, the firing of the end effector or the like. [00189) Second drive converter assembly 650 includes a proximal coupling 652 configured for selective connection to a distal end of drive shaft 14, , a slip clutch system 654 connected to proximal coupling 652 and rotatably supported within a housing of adapter assembly 600, and an input drive shaft 655 supporting a spur gear 655a thereon (see FIG. 68) operatively connected to slip clutch system 654 and actuatable thereby. [00190] Second drive converter assembly 650 further includes outer gear 664 of nested gear set 660. In particular, spur gear 655a of input drive shaft 655 is engaged with proximal spur gear 664a of outer gear 664. Second drive converter assembly 650 further includes an output drive shaft 656 supporting a proximal spur gear 656a that is threadably engaged with distal spur gear 664b of outer gear 664 and supporting a distal threaded coupling 656b that is threadably engaged with a threaded proximal end portion 658a of second drive shaft 658. [0019IJ Second drive shaft 658 is supported for axial reciprocation within the housing of adapter assembly. Second drive shaft 658 includes a threaded proximal end portion 658a threadably coupled to distal threaded coupling 656b of output drive shaft 656 and a distal end portion extending to a distal end of the housing of adapter assembly 600. The distal end portion of second drive shaft 658 defines a connection member configured and adapted for selective engagement with an axially translatable drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40. [00192) In operation, as outer gear 664 is rotated due to a rotation of input drive shaft 655 and second drive shaft 14 of surgical device 10, second drive shaft 658 is caused to be translated axially relative to distal threaded coupling 656b of output drive shaft 656. Accordingly, as second drive shaft 658 is translated axially, with the distal connection member thereof connected to a drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40, second drive shaft 658 causes concomitant axial translation of the drive member of any of end effectors 20, 30 and/or 40 to effectuate an operation and/or function thereof, such as, for example, the articulation of the end effector or the like. [00193] It is contemplated that any of the adapter assemblies described herein may be provided with seals or the like in order to maintain the insufflation of the target site. [00194] It is further contemplated that the outer tubes of the adapter assemblies may be provided with cut-outs or slots to provide for proper cleaning of the adapter assembly in an ultrasonic bath or the like. [00195J In accordance with the present disclosure, it is contemplated that any of the adapter assemblies herein may include any number of lengths, may be rigid or may be flexible in nature. [00196] It is further contemplated that any of the adapter assemblies herein may include any conductive, optical, magnetic or radio-frequency identification device that can relay information from information stored in a memory device (e.g., micro-chip) of the end effector through to a micro-controller or the like provided in surgical device 10. Such information can be used to determine control parameters for surgical device 10. [00197] It is additionally contemplated that any of the end effectors, any of the adapter assemblies, and the surgical device 10 may be provided with active wireless communication features, such as, for example, ZigBee® (a specification for a suite of high level communication protocols using small, low-power digital radios based on the IEEE 802.15.4-2003 standard for wireless personal area networks (WPANs)) or Bluetooth® (an open wireless protocol for exchanging data over short distances (using short length radio waves) from fixed and mobile devices, creating personal area networks (PANs)); or by passive communication methods, such as, for example, RFiD (radio-frequency identification). [00198] Any of the adapter assemblies herein may include an independent power source (e.g., a battery) to operate specific drives and/or to power specific sensors and/or identification electronics. [00199] Any of the adapter assemblies may incorporate a transmission or gearing portion to optimize the rotational speed and torque or the linear speed and -force to control and manipulate specific end effectors. [00200] It will be understood that various modifications may be made to the embodiments of the presently disclosed adapter assemblies.
