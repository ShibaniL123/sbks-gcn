TITLE GRAFT POLYMERIZATION INITIATED ON GRAPHITIC NANOMATERIALS AND THEIR NANOCOMPOSITE FORMATION RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/935,953, filed on February 5, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH [0002] This invention was made with government support under Grant No. DD-N000141110069 from the Office of Naval Research at the US Department of Defense. The government has certain rights in the invention. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0003] The present invention is directed to graft polymerization initiated on graphitic nanomaterials and their nanocomposite formation with plastics. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0004] In the previous invention entitled "Thiation of Carbon Nanotubes and Composite Formation" (United States Patent 7,713,508 B2), graft polymerization initiated on dithioester- functionalized carbon nanotubes and their composite formation was first described by Curran, et al. Dithiocarboxylic ester formation catalyzed by phosphorus pentasulfide was well documented for various alcohols and carboxylic acid. The role of phosphorus pentasulfide was proposed to be activation of carboxylic functional group for nucleophilic attack and thiation of hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups. Utilizing dithioester as a chain transfer agent for living free-radical polymerization of monomers, preferably through the mechanism of Reversible Addition- Fragmentation Chain Transfer (RAFT) polymerization, multi-walled carbon nanotube- polystyrene (MWCNT-PS) was synthesized and their composite formation with polystyrene was well characterized (J. Mater. Res. 2006 21, 1071-1077). Thin films made from the composite with low MWCNT loadings (less than 0.9 wt. %) were optically transparent and no evidence of aggregation of nanotubes in the thin film or solution was observed. The result from the conductivity measurement as a function of MWCNT loadings suggests two charge transport mechanisms: charge hopping in low MWCNT loadings (0.02 - 0.6 wt. %) and ballistic quantum conduction in high loadings (0.6 - 0.9 wt. %). The composite exhibits dramatically enhanced conductivity up to 33 S/m at a low MWCNT loading (0.9 wt. %). [0005] An improved method was developed to connect general graphitic structures to other organic based monomers. The present invention comprises organic hybrid nanomaterials with graphitic structures eovalent!y bonded via chemical ly reactive groups on the outer walls of the structure and methods for forming the covalently bonded structures to many other organic based monomers and/or polymers through RAFT polymerization utilizing dithioester as a chain transfer agent. The present invention also comprises nanocomposite formation of such organic hybrid nanomaterials with plastic to form graphitic nanocomposite reinforced plastic articles. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0006] In some embodiments, graphitic nanomaterials may comprise at least one type of material that is rich in carbon content that is densely packed in a regular sp -bonded structure. Examples of such materials include, but are not limited to, carbon black, carbon fiber, graphite, graphene, graphene oxides, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes and their derivatives. [0007] In some embodiments, graphitic nanocomposites may comprise at least two covalently linked structures. As a nonlimiting example, the structures may be linked with a dithioester having a formula such as: Here carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are used as an example to represent the graphitic materials. A similar formula should apply to all other graphitic nanomaterials listed above. [0008] In some embodiments, a method of functionalizing graphitic materials comprise thiolating the surface of graphitic materials with phosphorus pentasulfide (P4S10), Lawesson's reagent: 2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)- 1 ,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane-2,4-disulfide (C14H1402P2S4), Belleau' s Reagent: 2,4-Bis(4-phenoxyphenyl)- 1 ,3-dithia-2,4-diphosphetane-2,4-disulfide (C24H1802P2S4) or Davy's Reagent: 2,4-Bis(methylthio)-l,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane-2,4- disulfide (C2H6P2S6). In some embodiments, the method may comprise carboxylizing the graphitic materials prior to reacting with phosphorus pentasulfide or other reagents in an organic solution. The graphitic materials are reacted with the phosphorus pentasulfide or other reagents in an organic solution comprising anhydrous toluene or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. The solution is refluxed. For example, the solution may be refluxed for equal to or between approximately 12 and 48 hours at temperatures equal to or between about 110 and 200 °C. [0009] In some embodiments, the method further comprises polymerizing the dithioester- functionalized graphitic materials utilized dithioester as a chain transfer agent for living free- radical polymerization of monomers, such as through the mechanism of RAFT polymerization. [0010] In some embodiments, the dithioester-functionalized graphitic materials are sonicated with at least one type of organic monomers and at least one type of free-radical initiators in an organic solution comprising anhydrous toluene, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, N,N- dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, 4-butyrolactone or l,3-dimethyl-2- imidazolidinone..

The reaction mixture is then cooled and tetrahydrofuran is added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is added to methanol and a polymerized graphitic nanocomposite is precipitated and dried. [0012] In some embodiments, the polymerized graphitic nanomaterial is mixed with their corresponding polymers in a ratio equal to or between about 1 and 99 wt. % to produce common plastic articles.

In some embodiments, the polymerized graphitic nanomaterial to corresponding polymers ratio may be equal to or between about 1 to 50 wt. %. In some embodiments, the abovenoted polymerized graphitic nanomaterial to corresponding polymers ratio may be sufficient to produce common plastic articles that exhibit improved physical strength equal to or greater than 1 % comparing to the original plastic without graphitic nanomaterials. In some embodiments, the polymerized graphitic nanomaterial to corresponding polymers ratio may be equal to or between about 1 to 30 wt. %. In some embodiments, the abovenoted polymerized graphitic nanomaterial to corresponding polymers ratio may be sufficient to produce common plastic articles which exhibit lower plastic processing temperature equal to or greater than 1 °C comparing to the original plastic without graphitic nanomaterials. In some embodiments, the polymerized graphitic nanomaterial to corresponding polymers ratio may be equal to or between about 1 to 10 wt. %. In some embodiments, the abovenoted polymerized graphitic nanomaterial to corresponding polymers ratio may be sufficient to produce common plastic articles that may change the color or transparency of the original plastic without graphitic nanomaterials. In some embodiments, various graphitic nanomaterial(s) may be utilized to form polymerized articles with the graphitic nanocomposite by following similar procedures discussed above.

[0030] In some embodiments, the methods to produce graphitic nanocomposites with common plastics can vary depending on the articles of interest, which are listed individually in the following experimental examples. The solution/mixture described below used to produce such articles may vary in their chemical constituents, concentration of reagents in solution/mixture, and deposition procedure. The following sections are structured and arranged by the particular material type. Correspondingly, discussion about the composition of material, particular chemical solution/mixture used, and/or depositional procedure for various material types is provided below. [0031] Experimental Example [0032] Embodiments described herein are included to demonstrate particular aspects of the present disclosure. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the embodiments described herein merely represent exemplary embodiments of the disclosure. Those of ordinary skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments described and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. From the foregoing description, one of ordinary skill in the art can easily ascertain the essential characteristics of this disclosure, and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and modifications to adapt the disclosure to various usages and conditions. The embodiments described hereinabove are meant to be illustrative only and should not be taken as limiting of the scope of the disclosure. [0033] CNTs: The following describes an exemplary procedure to prepare dithioester- functionalized multi- walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Purified MWCNTs were first oxidized in concentrated H2SO4/HNO3 (7:3 v/v) solution by sonication (12 h, 130 W) to form carboxylic acid (-COOH) and hydroxyl (-OH) functional groups on the nanotube surface. The MWCNTs may be provided by any suitable method, such as synthesis by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or an arc discharge method. In some embodiments, the oxidation may not be required if enough carboxylic acid and hydroxyl functional groups already exist in the MWCNTs as received. The suspension was diluted with deionized water and filtered under vacuum through a nylon microfilter (0.2 μιη) and washed thoroughly with more deionized water. To form the dithiocarboxylic ester linkage, synthesis of thiolated MWCNTs was achieved by adding dried carboxylated MWCNTs to anhydrous toluene and phosphorus pentasulfide in a round bottomed flask. The resulting mixture was refluxed at 140 °C for 48 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled and filtered under vacuum through a nylon microfilter (0.2 μιη) and the product was washed thoroughly with anhydrous toluene and dried. The thiolated MWCNTs were then stored in a desiccator under nitrogen before use. [0034] Graphene/graphene oxide: The following describes an exemplary procedure to prepare dithioester-functionalized graphene/graphene oxide. Using liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite in common organic solvent such as /V-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, graphene/graphene oxide dispersion can be produced through sonication (24 h, 130 W). To form the dithiocarboxylic ester linkage, synthesis of thiolated graphene/graphene oxide was achieved by adding phosphorus pentasulfide into graphene/graphene oxide dispersion in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone in a round bottomed flask. The resulting mixture was heated at 140 °C for 48 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled and filtered under vacuum through a nylon microfilter (0.2 μιη) and the product was washed thoroughly with methanol and dried. The thiolated graphene/graphene oxide was then stored in a desiccator under nitrogen before use. [0035] CNT and styrene polymerization: The following describes an exemplary procedure to prepare polymerized MWCNT nanomaterial with styrene. In some embodiments, the procedure can also be used to produce polymerized MWCNT nanomaterial with other monomers, such as methacrylates, methacrylamides, acrylonitrile, butadiene, vinyl acetate, octadecyl acrylate, or the like. Dithioester-functionalized MWCNTs and the radical initiator azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) were first added into the Schlenk flask with stirrer bar and the air was pumped out of the flask and replaced the resulting vacuum with an inert gas (Argon or Nitrogen) and anhydrous toluene was added. The resulting mixture was first sonicated (10 s, 130 W) and styrene (after removal of inhibitor) in different molar ratios was added before the flask was sealed. The mixture was heated at 110 °C in a silicon oil bath for 24 hours with continual stirring. The reaction mixture was cooled before adding the tetrahydrofuran, and the resulting mixture was slowly added to methanol and precipitate formed. The precipitate was filtered and volatile materials were removed under vacuum to yield the light grey powder as the MWCNT-polystyrene (MWCNT- PS) nanomaterial. [0036] Graphene/graphene oxide and styrene polymerization: The following describes an exemplary procedure to prepare polymerized graphene/graphene oxide nanomaterial with styrene. The procedure can also be used to produce polymerized graphene/graphene oxide nanomaterial with other monomers, such as methacrylates, methacrylamides, acrylonitrile, butadiene, vinyl acetate, octadecyl acrylate, or the like. Dithioester-functionalized graphene/graphene oxide and the radical initiator azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) were first added into the Schlenk flask with stirrer bar and the air was pumped out of the flask and replaced the resulting vacuum with an inert gas (Argon or Nitrogen) and anhydrous toluene was added. The resulting mixture was first sonicated (10 s, 130 W) and styrene (after removal of inhibitor) in different molar ratio was added before the flask was sealed. The mixture was heated at 110 °C in a silicon oil bath for 24 hours with continual stirring. The reaction mixture was cooled before adding the tetrahydrofuran, and the resulting mixture was slowly added to methanol and precipitate formed. The precipitate was filtered and volatile materials were removed under vacuum to yield the light grey powder as the graphene/graphene oxide-polystyrene (graphene/graphene oxide-PS) nanomaterial. [0037] CNT and octadecyl acrylate polymerization: The following describes an exemplary procedure to prepare polymerized MWCNT nanomaterial with octadecyl acrylate. Dithioester- functionalized MWCNTs, octadecyl acrylate (in different molar ratios comparing to dithioester- functionalized MWCNTs) and the radical initiator azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) were first added into the Schlenk flask with stirrer bar and the air was pumped out of the flask and replaced the resulting vacuum with an inert gas (Argon or Nitrogen) and anhydrous toluene was added before the flask was sealed. The resulting mixture was first sonicated (10 s, 130 W) and then heated at 120 °C in a silicon oil bath for 20 hours with continual stirring. The reaction mixture was cooled and slowly added to methanol to form precipitate. The precipitate was filtered and volatile materials were removed under vacuum to yield the grey powder as the MWCNT- poly(octadecyl acrylate) (MWCNT-PODA) nanomaterial. Assuming fully recovery of the MWCNT-PODA, the loadings of the MWCNT to the final polymer composite can be calculated. The product from seven batches of the polymerization was collected separately and the loadings or ratio of the MWCNT to the final polymer composite product are 12, 14, 36, 47, 71, 89 and 99%, respectively. [0038] Melting point measurements of MWCNT-PODA composite: The melting points of MWCNT-PODA composite samples were determined by visually observing the onset of a phase change from a solid to a liquid. A vial containing a known amount of composite sample was tightly bound to the probe of a digital thermometer using two nylon zip ties. The probe/sample system was then immersed in a silicone oil bath to promote uniform heating of the sample. The oil bath was heated/stirred using a hotplate/magnetic stirrer. An additional glass alcohol- thermometer was used as a reference to corroborate the temperature readings outputted by the digital thermometer. The MWCNT-PODA composite with MWCNT loadings of 12% displayed a melting point of 48.9 + 1.0 °C. The MWCNT-PODA composite with MWCNT loadings of 14% displayed a melting point of 53.1 + 1.0 °C. No change was visually observable for MWCNT-PODA composites with MWCNT loadings of 36, 47, 71, 89 and 99%, even after heating the oil bath to ~ 200 °C. [0039] Electrical conductivity measurements of MWCNT-PODA composite: The electrical conductivity of MWCNT-PODA nanocomposite materials were calculated using measured values of the resistance across each of seven different experimental mixtures differing only in MWCNT loading. Samples for electronic characterization were prepared by adding ~ 500 μΐ^ of hexane to ~ 30 mg of each of the dry experimental mixtures. Three samples were prepared for each of the seven different filler-loadings via drop-casting of ~ 50 μΐ^ aliquots of the respective mixture between pairs of thin-film gold (Au) electrodes on a glass substrate, yielding a total of 21 composite samples. Once drop-casted onto the characterization devices, the samples were allowed air-dry at room conditions (-20 °C, relative humidity (RH) ~ 55%) for 5 minutes prior to curing in a ventilated oven at 60 °C for 10 minutes. After curing, compact, hard, and uniform composites were obtained for certain filler-loadings. All mixtures with MWCNT-loadings equal or more than 47% formed brittle films that exhibited a high degree of cracking/fracturing, which was observed to increase proportionally with increasing filler-loading. Thin-film Au electrodes were prepared via evaporation under high-vacuum. The dimensional parameters of the thin-film Au electrodes were previously characterized using a high-precision profilometer. The values of thin-film thickness and inter-electrode gap were used in calculating the electrical conductivity of each sample. Resistance measurements were taken using the two-point probe setup and a picoammeter/sourcemeter. The conductivity values calculated for each of the seven experimental mixtures are summarized at Table 1.
