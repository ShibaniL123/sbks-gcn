Since higher chiral purity was desired, the classical resolution was repeated on the enantio-enriched amine: A solution of (1R,2R)-2-(benzylamino)-1-methylcyclopentanol (2b-00, (41.0 g, 200 mmol, 96% ee) in EtOH (200 mL) was heated at 80° C. with stirring for 30 minutes. A separate 2 L, three-necked flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, internal thermometer and water-cooled condenser was charged with (2S)-[(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)amino](phenyl)ethanoic acid (CAS#74927-72-3, 67 g, 194 mmol, 0.97 equiv; since amine was -96% ee) and EtOH (1.3 L). This flask was stirred and heated at 80° C. (internal) until the solid dissolved (˜15 min) then for 30 min more. The hot amine solution was added to the hot acid solution through a funnel in a steady flow (less than 1 min), and the transfer quantitated with EtOH (10 mL). Precipitation began in about 1 min, and by 5 min a thick white suspension had formed, though stirring was not hindered. Stirring was continued at 80° C. for 4 h, then heating was discontinued and the reaction stirred and allowed to gradually cool to room temperature overnight. The resulting solid was collected by filtration, washed with EtOH (350 mL) and dried (10 mmHg, 40° C.) for 1.5 days to give (1R,2R)-N-benzyl-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentanaminium (2S)-[(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)amino](phenyl)acetate (2b-RR, 106 g, 99%).
