(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(3-ethyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-me thyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5 -difluorophenyl)acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-cyano-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2, 3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 19a (200 mg, 0.45 mmol), N-hydroxypropionamidine (40 mg, 0.45 mmol), 0.15 mL of a solution of 1 M zinc chloride in diethyl ether, and p-toluenesulfonic acid hydrate (25.7 mg, 0.135 mmol) were successively added to 5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction was warmed up to 80Â°C. After stirring for 12 hours, the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-(3-ethyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3 -methyl-1 ,2,3 ,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5 -difluoropheny 1)acrylate 19b (210 mg, yield 90.5%) as a colorless oil.
