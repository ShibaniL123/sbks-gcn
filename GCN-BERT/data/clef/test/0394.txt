Example 17: Synthesis of compound 11143, 1-isopropyl-N-phenyl-N-(4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)piperidine-4-carboxamide
N-phenyl-N-(4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)piperidine-4-carboxamide hydrochloride (0.100 g, 0.214 mmol), synthesized in Example 11, and acetone (0.024 mL, 0.321 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) at room temperature, and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (0.068 g, 0.321 mmol) was added to the solution, followed by stirring at the same temperature. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 12 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 80%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.021 g, 20.8%) as a white solid.
