Field of the Art The invention relates to a new hyaluronan acid derivative which is suitable for the preparation of hydrogels, and a method of preparation thereof. Further it relates to hydrogels based on said derivative, properties thereof, use and method of preparation thereof. State of the Art Hyaluronan is a polysaccharide consisting of disaccharidic units composed of D--glucuronic acid and D-N-acetylglucosamine which are bound by alternating β-1,4 and β-1,3 glycosidic bonds. The weight average molecular weight (if molecular weight is spoken of hereinefter, it will always be the weight average molecular weight) in vivo is within the range of 3 kDa - 20 MDa. It is a polysaccharide which is easily soluble in an aqueous medium in which it forms highly viscous solutions, depending on its molecular weight and concentration. Hydrogels are materials which are formed in water by an insoluble network of at least partially hydrophilic polymers1. There are several ways how to produce an insoluble network from an initially hydrophilic polymer. It is polymer hydrophobization2 or the use of a watersoluble polymer derivative bearing reactive functional groups which may take part in further chemical reactions leading to the formation of a 3-dimensional polymer network3-5. The preparation of soluble hyaluronan derivatives and the following crosslinking thereof has been described by a number of authors3-6. In the past, the use of phenol hyaluronan derivative for crosslinking reactions and preparation of hydrogels have been described as well. Calabro et. al.4, 7, 8 disclose the method of the preparation of phenol hyaluronan derivatives by means of a reaction of carboxyls which are present within the structure of hyaluronan D-glucuronic acid with aminoalkyl derivatives of phenol. This reaction produces hyaluronan amides. The crucial feature for the proceeding of said synthesis is the activation of the hyaluronan carboxyl for which the reaction with dehydrating agents of carbodiimide type (such as EDC) is used. The most frequently used aminoalkyl phenol is tyramine6. In general, crosslinking of phenol hyaluronan derivatives is initiated by adding a peroxidase (such as horseradish peroxidase - HRP) and a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution. The horseradish peroxidase (Horseradish peroxidase, HRP, E.C.1.11.1.7) is nowadays widely used as a catalyst of organic and biotransformation reactions9-13. It is characterised by a very broad substrate specificity and therefore, it is capable of oxidising a number of both organic and inorganic compounds13-15. It is an enzyme comprising hem containing iron, as a prosthetic group. The iron has the oxidation degree (III) in the non-activated state of the enzyme. The reaction with peroxides leads to the formation of an intermediate which is called HRP-I. The hem iron Fe(III) is oxidised to oxyferryl group (Fe(IV)=O) and at the same time, a cationic π-radical on the porphyrin cycle is formed. Such an activated enzyme is able to form complexes with the molecules of the substrate which, during this interaction, undergoes oxidation.14, 16-18 The conversion of the oxidated enzyme back to the initial form thereof proceeds in two steps. In the first step, a reaction between the substrate molecule (S) and HRP-I takes place, giving rise to the substrate radical (R•) and a partially reduced form of the enzyme HRP-II. HRP-II still retains the oxyferryl group (Fe(IV)=O) but it does not contain the porphyrin π--radical anymore. During the transition of an electron to the porphyrin radical one H+ is taken over by the protein at the same time. HRP-II undergoes the reaction with the substrate again, giving rise to R•. The oxyferryl group (Fe(IV)=O) is reduced back to Fe(III) during this reaction. This process is associated with the transfer of 2 H+ to the oxygen of oxyferryl group. One proton originates from the substrate (or solvent), the other form the protein. This results in the formation of a water molecule (Equation I and Scheme I). HRP+H2⁢O2→kaHRP-I+H2⁢OHRP-I+S→kbHRP-II+R-HRP-II+S→kcHRP+R-+H2⁢O2⁢R-→kdR-RBasic description of the mechanism of catalysis of substrate oxidation by means of HRP The resulted radicals of the substrate are in a number of cases able to interact together, forming dimers R-R. This process is not affected enzymatically anymore and is related to the stability and reactivity of the resulted radicals. 14,16-26 Therefore, in case of an enzymatic crosslinking reaction of the phenol derivative of polysaccharide, the substrate (phenol - reactive ligand bound to the polymer) is transformed by an enzyme to a reactive radical. This radical can then react with another phenol radical, forming dityramine. Supposing a free mobility of the substrate (ligand) molecules of the enzymatic reaction and the proceeding of the reaction exactly copying the equation I, the enzyme should gradually transform (provided a sufficient amount of peroxide is used) all the substrate molecules to the reactive radicals and these should all gradually undergo dimerisation (or oligomerisation), if a sufficiently long reaction time is provided. In case of linking the substrate (ligand) to the polymer, the crosslinking degree of the polymer should always reach the same value, even though the time for reaching this value would differ depending on the amount of the enzyme used. In practice it is different though. The literature27 discloses in detail the relationships between the expected ratio of intramolecular and intermolecular crosslinking and the molecular weight of the polymer segments between the crosslinking locations (crosslinking density, the distance between the network nodes), while intramolecular interactions leading to the crosslinking are indicated as elastically non-effective, compared to intermolecular crosslinking. Further, it is known from the literature that in case of using the phenol derivatives of HA, the amount of the enzyme affects not only the speed of the crosslinking reaction but also significantly affects the resulting mechanical properties of the hydrogels4, 6, 7,28. The literature states that by rheologic measurements it has been found out that the modulus of shear (G') is higher if a higher concentration of the enzyme is used. The reason of this phenomenon, according to the authors, is a higher crosslinking density of the hydrogels. If a maximally firm hydrogel is to be prepared, the crosslinking reaction must proceed at a relatively high concentration of peroxidase, and therefore also faster. However, too fast proceedings of the reaction can then lead to the formation of a non-homogenous crosslinked hydrogel. There may then appear locations in the samples which are not crosslinked at all. Moreover, too fast proceedings of the reaction may also cause problems when placing the gel to the location of the final application thereof and the like. The cause thereof is a small distance of the reactive centre from the basic polymer chain. The low mobility of the ligand decreases the probability of an effective collision of the ligand radicals to form dityramine. Therefore, if there is a low concentration of the enzyme within the system, small amount of reactive ligand forms may form in a time unit. Thus the crosslinking reaction proceeds slowly and is a little effective. Park et. al. 29 tried to increase the reactivity of the ligands bound to the polymer by inserting a suitable spacer between the reactive ligand and the polymer chain. The document discloses insertion of a hydrophilic chain between the polysaccharide chain and the phenol or aniline ring in order to increase the reactivity of these substitutes. The main reason for introducing the hydrophilic chain into the structure of polymer was improving the solubility thereof and improving the accessibility of the reactive centres (phenol or aniline ring). An easier spatial accessibility of the reactive centres increases the probability of the reaction between the ligands. Most frequently, while maintaining the same enzyme activity, this step leads to a higher substitution degree, a higher concentration and better homogeneity of the hydrogel crosslinking. Moreover, according to the author, thanks to the introduction of this hydrophilic chain into the hydrogel structure, the biostability and mechanical properties of the hydrogel are increased. However, Park et al. use as a "spacer" a hydrophilic polymer PEG having the molecular weight of 3500 Da, and therefore, in the end it is rather a copolymer. However, such an intervention to the hydrogel structure, even in a low substitution degree, leads to significant changes of physical properties of the original polymer. Moreover, in case of hyaluronan, a higher crosslinking concentration leads to an increased hardness of the hydrogel, but at the same time it also leads to an increased fragility thereof, which is undesirable for the intended use in the tissue engineering. When a material designated for scaffolds, for example, but not only, for scaffolds for articular cartilage, is concerned, a stress is laid on the sufficient strength and resistance thereof, while a material which is fragile is irreversibly deformed at a higher load and in case of hydrogels, even a total destruction thereof occurs. Summary of the Invention The aim of the invention therefore is to find a material which would be sufficiently strong and at the same time tenacious and which would not exhibit any significant changes of biological and physical properties compared to the original polymer. The strength of the hydrogel based on hyaluronan may generally be increased by increasing the crosslinking concentration, such as by increasing the concentration of the polymer in the solution from which the hydrogel is formed, or by increasing the substitution degree of the polymer. However, in the state of the art in case of hyaluronan both of these methods have led also to an increased fragility of the resulting hydrogel which significantly limits the possible uses of the hydrogel. The problem that is solved by this invention consists in finding such derivatives that would lead to an increased ligand reactivity and an increased hydrogel strength, while maintaining the physical and biological properties of the original polymer. Surprisingly, it was found out that by introducing a relatively short spacer (having the molecular weight of approximately 130 Da) according to the invention between the reactive ligand and HA results in a significant increase of tenacity of the final hydrogels already at a very low substitution degree. Therefore, in one aspect the invention relates to a HA derivative bearing reactive ligands bound via hydrophobic spacers, with the aim of increasing the mobility of ligands and thus increasing the probability of an effective collision thereof, even in case of a low concentration thereof (low substitution degree and low enzyme activity). It was found out that in spite of a very low weight abundance of the spacer within the hydrogel, making e.g. only 0.01 to 0.02 %, a significant increase of tenacity and strength of the hydrogel is achieved compared to a hydrogel based on an analogous HA derivative without an inserted spacer (i.e. identical concentration, molar weight and degree of substitution / crosslinking). Therefore, the invention relates to this new hyaluronan derivative suitable for the preparation of hydrogels and a method of preparation thereof. Further, it relates to hydrogels based on this derivative, the use thereof and the method of preparation thereof. The hydrogel is prepared by a method using crosslinking of the chains of the modified hyaluronan by means of a reaction that is catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase or analogues thereof. Suitable hyaluronan derivatives contain in their structure phenol or heteroaryl phenol rings covalently bound to the basic polysaccharide chain. The crosslinking procedure may be described as a cascade of consecutive chemical reactions which start with forming the reactive forms of oxygen (ROS) within the system. These are added to the mixture or their formation is enabled by the presence of chemical compounds which serve as a "generator" thereof. ROS activate the enzyme peroxidase or analogues thereof which subsequently catalyse the dimerization (or oligomerization) of aromatic or heteroaromatic rings present within the structure of the hyaluronan derivative. This leads to the formation of a three-dimensional polymer network. According to the invention, hyaluronan modified by binding a ligand containing aminoalkyl phenol or aminoalkyl heteroaryl phenol (e.g. tyramine, 5-hydroxy tryptophane, serotonin) is used for the preparation of this hydrogel. The hyaluronan derivatives described in this invention contain a ligand which is bound to the polysacharide by means of a spacer. The presence of this spacer within the structure of the HA derivative leads, thanks to its flexibility, to an increase of elasticity and freedom of possibilities of conformational arrangement of the participating polymer segments, and thus also the possibility of dissipation of deformation energy. The introduction of a spacer also increases the distance of the reactive aromatic centre (phenol, heteroaryl phenol) from the basic polymer chain, improves the accessibility thereof for an interaction with the enzyme and significantly affects the course of the crosslinking reaction and the properties of the resulting hydrogel. In its first aspect the invention relates to the derivative based on hyaluronic acid according to the general formula (I) where Ar is phenyl and R1 is ethylene, or Ar is indole and R1 is ethylene, or Ar is indole and R1 is karboxyethylene, and where R2 is an alkyl having 3 to 7 carbons, and where n is within the range from 1 to 7500. In another aspect, the invention relates to the method of preparation of the derivative according to the general formula (I), where first an aldehyde derivative of hyaluronic acid according to the formula (II) is prepared, where the aldehyde derivative is prepared by using the oxidation system 4-acetamido-TEMPO/NaClO in a protic medium and has the substitution degree 5 - 15 % and the molecular weight within the range 10000 g/mol to 2000000 g/mol, then separately the compound according to the general formula (III) is prepared where Ar is phenyl and R1 is ethylene, or Ar is indole and R1 is ethylene, or Ar is indole and R1 is karboxyethylene, and where R2 is an alkyl having 3 to 7 carbons, and where n is within the range of 1 to 7500, wherein the compound according to the general formula (III) is prepared by a reaction of a spacer precursor according to the formula (IV) Z-NH-R2-COOH (IV), where Z is a protecting group which is commonly used for the protection of the primary amino group, with the ligand according to the formula (V) in an aprotic medium at a temperature within the range of 40 °C to 150 °C for 1 to 24 hours in the presence of an agent activating the carboxyl functional groups, forming the compound according to the general formula (VI) Z-NH-R2-CO-NH-R1-Ar-OH (VI), from which the compound according to the general formula (III) is prepared by removing the protecting group Z, and then the aldehyde derivative of hyaluronic acid according to the formula (II) is reacted with the compound according to the general formula (III) at a pH within the range of 3 to 8 at room temperature for 1 to 72 hours in the presence of picoline-borane complex, forming the derivative according to the formula (I). Therefore, the derivative according to the invention contains a ligand capable of undergoing oligomerization by means of a treatment by a suitable agent, and a flexible spacer which is inserted between the hyaluronan chain and the ligand. The ligand according to the general formula (V) according to the invention is preferably selected from the group comprising tyramine, serotonin and 5-hydroxytryptophane. The compound according to the general formula (IV), i.e. the spacer precursor, is preferably selected from the group of amino acids including derivatives of ω-[(tert butoxycarbonyl) amino] carboxylic acids where R2 is an alkyl having 3 to 7 carbons. In another preferred embodiment of the method according to the invention the reaction of the spacer precursor with the ligand takes place in THF or DMF at 50 °C for 2 to 6 hours in the presence of 1,1 '-carbodiimidazole. Further, it is preferred that the removal of the protecting group Z is performed by means of trifluoro acetic acid or hydrochloric acid. Just for the sake of this invention, the intermediate spacer-ligand is represented by the compounds according to the general formula: HO-Ar-R1-NH-CO-R2-NH2 Preferably, the compound according to the general formula: -CO-R2-NH2 where R2 is an alkyl having 3 to 7, is used as a spacer. The method of preparation of the derivative according to the invention may be characterized by the Scheme 1: Further, the invention relates to the hydrogel formed by crosslinking the derivative according to the general formula (I) and a method of preparation thereof. This method of preparation of the hydrogel consists in that the derivative according to the general formula (I) is treated by a reactive phenoxy radicals generator, preferably by a system horseradish peroxidase and a source of hydroxyl radicals, which may be a solution of hydrogen peroxide in water, or a system oxidase-oxygen-substrate, e.g. galactose oxidase - galactose or glucose oxidase - glucose, at a pH within the range of 4 to 10. Therefore, for oligomerization of reactive ligands, agents that are able to bring about the formation of phenoxy radicals from the aromatic rings of ligands are used. According to this invention, preferably the system peroxide / horseradish peroxidase is used. The peroxide may be introduced into the system in the form of a diluted solution, or is generated by a chemical reaction in situ. Hydrogen peroxide may be generated in the mixture by means of various kinds of enzymes (oxidases) from oxygen, as an electron acceptor, and a respective electron donor in an oxidation - reduction reaction. Preferably, a combination of galactose oxidase or glucose oxidase and the substrates thereof: galactose and glucose may be used. Other agents which are capable of causing the formation of phenoxy radicals in the presence of a molecular oxygen are enzymes tyrosinase, lactase etc. The properties of these hydrogels are, as is generally known, affected by the chemical structure of the polymer and the concentration thereof, as well as the selected types of crosslinking agents and their amount used. The physically chemical properties of the polymer (HA derivative) are above all affected by the monomer structure, conformation of polymer chain segments, crosslinking degree and the molecular weight. The mechanical properties of the polymer are influenced by these as well. When the polymer is mechanically stressed, deformation thereof occurs wherein a part of the absorbed deformation energy dissipates - consumes for the change of the conformation of the network nodes and polymer chain segments and a part of the energy is irrevocably transformed to heat. The amount of the dissipated energy, and thus also the possibility of adopting various conformation arrangements within the polymer structure is associated with the stiffness of macromolecular chains and reflects the extent of elastic resistance of the material to deformation. Polymer materials composed of rigid inflexible chains and segments thereof then may exhibit a low extent of elastic resistance to deformation and fragility. The increase of elasticity of these polymers is conducted according to the method of the invention where flexible segments are introduced into the polymer structure. Said segments are characterized by a higher freedom of individual molecules about their bonds whereby achieving an increase of possibilities of their conformational arrangement when subjected to the deformation energy, and of possibilities of dissipation of said energy. Therefore, an introduction of a suitable flexible spacer between the ligand and the basic hyaluronan chain leads to achieving a higher elasticity, tenacity and strength of the final material, which is very beneficial for e.g. hydrogels intended for scaffolds for treatment of defects of certain tissues exposed to higher loads, such as articular cartilage or bones. As described above, the introduction of the flexible spacer between the ligand and the basic hyaluronan chain may be preferably used also in case where the mechanical properties of the hydrogels depend on the concentration of the enzyme used as the crosslinking reaction catalyst. The introduction of the flexible spacer between the ligand and the basic hyaluronan chain provides for a sufficient steric accessibility of the reactive groups of the derivative for mutual dimerization, even after a partial crosslinking of the polymer. This solution results in making the crosslinking reaction more effective which brings about a higher homogeneity of the prepared hydrogels and thus leads to overcoming the technology problems associated with crosslinking hyaluronan modified by hydroxyphenyl or heteroaryl phenol (tyramin, serotonin etc.) in the case where the crosslinking agents are horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide (or another type of phenoxy radicals generator). However, surprisingly we have further found out that the introduction of our selected spacers between the ligand and the basic hyaluronan chain leads even at a very low substitution degree to a significant increase of the extent of elasticity, tenacity and strength of the final hydrogel based on said HA derivative. Further, the invention relates to the use of hydrogels based on the dervivatives according to the invention, especially in the field of tissue engineering, cosmetics, medicine and regenerative medicine. The use of the hydrogels described in this application is aimed especially at the basic material for formation of scaffolds in tissue engineering, mainly in the field of the treatment of articular and bone defects, such as coverings for wound healing, as a biodegradable barrier hindering from the formation of post-surgical coalescences, for augmentation of soft tissues and fillings of tissue defects and the like. When using the hydrogel as a material for scaffolds, the scaffolds may be either seeded or non-seeded. If they are seeded scaffolds, the type of the cells which are to be incorporated in the scaffold is selected depending on the aimed location of application.

The first step is the preparation of an aledehyde hyaluronan derivative (Example 1.7). Another step is the synthesis of various intermediates spacer-ligand (Examples 1.1 to 1.6) which were then linked to hyaluronan by the reductive amination process (Examples 1.9 - 1.14).

Differences in the hydrogel properties Example 2.1 : Difference in mechanical properties of hydrogels depending on the type of HA derivative used and the amount of the added enzyme Samples of hydrogels from the derivatives VIII (tyramine, without the incorporated spacer), IX, XI and XII (with an incorporated spacer) were prepared according to the examples 1.16 or 1.17, depending on the type of the derivative used. The samples were, after a thorough homogenization, let mature for 120 minutes at room temperature. The anologues of the derivatives used for the preparation of the compared hydrogels always had a comparable molecular weight and substitution degree. All samples had the same dimensions and were tested at constant laboratory conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity). Young modulus of elasticity in compression, tenacity, compression strength and the corresponding sample deformation were measured for each sample; and for viscoelastic properites of the samples the shear modulus and loss angle were measured. The obtained data clearly imply that the introduction of the flexible spacer between the ligand and basic hyaluronan chain leads to a higher elasticity, tenacity and strength of the hydrogels based on said derivatives, compared to the hydrogels based on analogous hyaluronan derivatives without any spacer. Table 1 shows the comparison of the mechanical properties of the hydrogel depending on the type of derivative used for the preparation thereof. The concentration (%) means the concentration of the polymer in the solution from which the hydrogel was prepared, the substitution degree (%) indicates the substitution degree by the reactive / crosslinking ligand, i.e. the number of the bound ligands per 100 of the structural units of the polymer, wherein in case of HA the structural unit of the polymer is disaccharide (or dimer) glycosamine + glucuronic acid. 1.
