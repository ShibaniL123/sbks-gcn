Example 4. (R)-2-azido-1-(3-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)pyrrolidine-1-yl)ethane-1-one
247 mg of 2-azidoacetic acid was added to a 25-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 8.00 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide. After 503 mg of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 0.850 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine were added thereto, the reaction mixture was stirred for about 15 minutes. 265 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to another 25-mL round-bottomed flask, and then the previously prepared 2-azidoacetic acid mixture was added thereto. This mixture was refluxed overnight. The mixture was cooled down to room temperature and then filtered through a Celiteâ„¢ 545 filter agent. The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 19.3 mg of (R)-2-azido-1-(3-(methyl(7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-yl)amino)pyrrolidine-1-yl)ethane-1-one was obtained with a yield of about 5.27%.
