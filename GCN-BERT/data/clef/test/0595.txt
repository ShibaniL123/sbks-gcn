As used herein the term "protecting group," refers to a labile chemical moiety which is known in the art to protect reactive groups including without limitation, hydroxyl, amino and thiol groups, against undesired reactions during synthetic procedures. Protecting groups are typically used selectively and/or orthogonally to protect sites during reactions at other reactive sites and can then be removed to leave the unprotected group as is or available for further reactions. Protecting groups as known in the art are described generally in Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th edition, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 2007. Groups can be selectively incorporated into oligomeric compounds as provided herein as precursors. For example an amino group can be placed into a compound as provided herein as an azido group that can be chemically converted to the amino group at a desired point in the synthesis. Generally, groups are protected or present as precursors that will be inert to reactions that modify other areas of the parent molecule for conversion into their final groups at an appropriate time. Further representative protecting or precursor groups are discussed in Agrawal et al. , Protocols for Oligonucleotide Conjugates, Humana Press; New Jersey, 1994, 26, 1-72. The term "orthogonally protected" refers to functional groups which are protected with different classes of protecting groups, wherein each class of protecting group can be removed in any order and in the presence of all other classes (see, Barany et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1977, 99, 7363- 7365; Barany et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1980, 102, 3084-3095). Orthogonal protection is widely used in for example automated oligonucleotide synthesis. A functional group is deblocked in the presence of one or more other protected functional groups which is not affected by the deblocking procedure. This deblocked functional group is reacted in some manner and at some point a further orthogonal protecting group is removed under a different set of reaction conditions. This allows for selective chemistry to arrive at a desired compound or oligomeric compound. Examples of hydroxyl protecting groups include without limitation, acetyl, t-butyl, t- butoxymethyl, methoxymethyl, tetrahydropyranyl, 1-ethoxyethyl, 1 -(2-chloroethoxy)ethyl, p- chlorophenyl, 2,4-dinitrophenyl, benzyl, 2,6-dichlorobenzyl, diphenylmethyl, p-nitrobenzyl, bis(2- acetoxyethoxy)methyl (ACE), 2-trimethylsilylethyl, trimethylsilyl, triethylsilyl, t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl, triphenylsilyl, [(triisopropylsilyl)oxy]methyl (TOM), benzoylformate, chloroacetyl, trichloroacetyl, trifluoroacetyl, pivaloyl, benzoyl, p-phenylbenzoyl, 9-fluorenylmethyl carbonate, mesylate, tosylate, triphenylmethyl (trityl), monomethoxytrityl, dimethoxytrityl (DMT), trimethoxytrityl, l(2-fluorophenyl)-4-methoxypiperidin-4-yl (FPMP), 9-phenylxanthine-9-yl (Pixyl) and 9-(p-methoxyphenyl)xanthine-9-yl (MOX).

Examples of thiol protecting groups include without limitation, triphenylmethyl (trityl), benzyl (Bn), and the like. The terms "substituent" and "substituent group," as used herein, are meant to include groups that are typically added to a parent compounds or to further substituted substituent groups to enhance one or more desired properties or provide other desired effects. Substituent groups can be protected or unprotected and can be added to one available site or many available sites on a parent compound. As an example if a benzene is substituted with a substituted alky it will not have any overlap with a benzene that is substituted with substituted hydroxyl. In such an example the alkyl portion of the substituted alkyl is covalently linked by one of its carbon atoms to one of the benzene carbon atoms. If the alky is Ci and it is substituted with a hydroxyl substituent group (substituted alkyl) then the resultant compound is benzyl alcohol (C6H5CH2OH). If the benzene were substituted with a substituted hydroxyl group and the hydroxyl was substituted with a Ci alkyl group then the resultant compound would be anisole (C6H5OCH3). Substituent groups amenable herein include without limitation, halogen, hydroxyl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl (-C(0)Raa), carboxyl (-C(O)O-Raa), aliphatic groups, alicyclic groups, alkoxy, substituted oxy (-O-Raa), aryl, aralkyl, heterocyclic radical, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, amino (-N(Rbb)(Rcc)), imino(=NRbb), amido (-C(0)N(Rbb)(Rcc) or -N(Rbb)C(0)Raa), azido (-N3), nitro (-NO2), cyano (-CN), carbamido (-OC(0)N(Rbb)(Rcc) or -N(Rbb)C(0)ORaa), ureido (-N(Rbb)C(0)- N(Rbb)(RcC)), thioureido (-N(Rbb)C(S)N(Rbb)(Rcc)), guanidinyl (-N(Rbb)C (=NRbb)N(Rbb)(RcC)) , amidinyl (-C(=NRbb)N(Rbb)(Rcc) or -N(Rbb)C(=NRbb)(Raa)), thiol (-SRbb), sulfmyl (-S(0)Rbb), sulfonyl (-S(0)2Rbb) and sulfonamidyl (-S(0)2N(Rbb)(Rcc) or -N(Rbb)S(0)2Rbb).

The sugar moiety of a monomer subunit provides the reactive groups that enable the linking of adjacent monomer subunits into an oligomeric compound. Illustrative examples of sugar moieties useful in the preparation of oligomeric compounds include without limitation, β-D-ribose, P-D-2'-deoxyribose, substituted sugars (such as 2', 5' and bis substituted sugars), 4'-S-sugars (such as 4'-S-ribose, 4'-S-2'-deoxyribose and 4'-S-2'-substituted ribose wherein the ring oxygen atom has been replaced with a sulfur atom), bicyclic modified sugars (such as the 2*-0-CH(CH3)-4*, 2*-0-CH2-4* or 2'-0-(α½)2-4' bridged ribose derived bicyclic sugars) and sugar surrogates (such as for example when the ribose ring has been replaced with a morpholino, a hexitol ring system or an open non-cyclic system). As used herein the term "sugar surrogate" refers to replacement of the nucleoside furanose ring with a non-furanose (or 4'-substituted furanose) group with another structure such as another ring system or open system. Such structures can be as simple as a six membered ring as opposed to the five membered furanose ring or can be more complicated such as a bicyclic or tricyclic ring system or a non-ring system such as that used in peptide nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, sugar surrogates include without limitation sugar surrogate groups such as morpholinos, cyclohexenyls and cyclohexitols. In general the heterocyclic base is maintained even when the sugar moiety is a sugar surrogate so that the resulting monomer subunit will be able to hybridize.

These modifications are meant to be illustrative and not exhaustive as other modifications are known in the art and are also envisioned as possible modifications for the modified nucleosides described herein. In certain embodiments, modified nucleosides comprise a sugar surrogate wherein the furanose ring has been replaced with a mono or polycyclic ring system or a non-cyclic sugar surrogate such as that used in peptide nucleic acids. Illustrative examples of sugar moieties for such modified nucleosides includes without limitation morpholino, hexitol, cyclohexenyl, 2.2.2 and 3.2.1 cyclohexose and open non-cyclic groups.

As used herein, "oligonucleotide" refers to a compound comprising a plurality of linked nucleosides. In certain embodiments, one or more of the plurality of nucleosides is modified. In certain embodiments, an oligonucleotide comprises one or more ribonucleo sides (R A) and/or deoxyribonucleosides (DNA). The term "oligonucleoside" refers to a sequence of nucleosides that are joined by internucleoside linkages that do not have phosphorus atoms. Internucleoside linkages of this type include short chain alkyl, cycloalkyl, mixed heteroatom alkyl, mixed heteroatom cycloalkyl, one or more short chain heteroatomic and one or more short chain heterocyclic. These internucleoside linkages include without limitation, siloxane, sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone, acetyl, formacetyl, thioformacetyl, methylene formacetyl, thioformacetyl, alkeneyl, sulfamate, methyleneimino, methylenehydrazino, sulfonate, sulfonamide, amide and others having mixed N, O, S and C¾ component parts. As used herein, the term "oligomeric compound" refers to a contiguous sequence of linked monomer subunits. Each linked monomer subunit normally includes a heterocyclic base moiety but monomer subunits also include those without a heterocyclic base moiety such as abasic monomer subunits. In certain embodiments, at least some and generally most if not essentially all of the heterocyclic bases in an oligomeric compound are capable of hybridizing to a nucleic acid molecule, normally a preselected RNA target. The term "oligomeric compound" therefore includes oligonucleotides, oligonucleotide analogs and oligonucleosides. It also includes polymers having one or a plurality of nucleosides having sugar surrogate groups. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds comprise a plurality of monomer subunits independently selected from naturally occurring nucleosides, non-naturally occurring nucleosides, modified nucleosides and nucleosides having sugar surrogate groups. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds are single stranded. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds are double stranded comprising a double-stranded duplex. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds comprise one or more conjugate groups and/or terminal groups. As used herein, "antisense compound" refers to an oligomeric compound, at least a portion of which is at least partially complementary to a target nucleic acid to which it hybridizes. In certain embodiments, an antisense compound modulates (increases or decreases) expression or amount of a target nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, an antisense compound alters splicing of a target pre- mRNA resulting in a different splice variant. In certain embodiments, an antisense compound modulates expression of one or more different target proteins. Antisense mechanisms contemplated herein include, but are not limited to an R ase H mechanism, RNAi mechanisms, splicing modulation, translational arrest, altering R A processing, inhibiting microRNA function, or mimicking microRNA function. As used herein the term "internucleoside linkage" or "internucleoside linking group" is meant to include all manner of internucleoside linking groups known in the art including but not limited to, phosphorus containing internucleoside linking groups such as phosphodiester and phosphorothioate, and non-phosphorus containing internucleoside linking groups such as formacetyl and methyl eneimino. Internucleoside linkages also includes neutral non-ionic internucleoside linkages such as amide-3 (3*-CH2-C(=0)-N(H)-5*), amide-4 (3*-CH2-N(H)-C(=0)-5*) and methylphosphonate wherein a phosphorus atom is not always present. In certain embodiments, each internucleoside linkage is, independently, a phosphorothioate or a phosphodiester internucleoside linkage. In certain embodiments, essentially each internucleoside linkage is a phosphodiester internucleoside linkage. In certain embodiments, essentially each internucleoside linkage is, a phosphorothioate internucleoside linkage. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds as provided herein can be prepared having one or more internucleoside linkages containing modified e.g. non-naturally occurring internucleoside linkages. The two main classes of internucleoside linkages are defined by the presence or absence of a phosphorus atom. Modified internucleoside linkages having a phosphorus atom include without limitation, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates including 3'- alkylene phosphonates, 5'-alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phos- phoramidates including 3 '-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, selenophosphates and boranophosphates having normal 3 '-5' linkages, 2'-5' linked analogs of these, and those having inverted polarity wherein one or more internucleotide linkages is a 3' to 3', 5' to 5' or 2' to 2' linkage. Oligonucleotides having inverted polarity can comprise a single 3' to 3' linkage at the 3 '-most internucleotide linkage i.e. a single inverted nucleoside residue which may be abasic (the nucleobase is missing or has a hydroxyl group in place thereof). Various salts, mixed salts and free acid forms are also included.

As used herein "neutral internucleoside linkage" is intended to include internucleoside linkages that are non-ionic. Neutral internucleoside linkages include without limitation, phosphotriesters, methylphosphonates, MMI (3*-CH2-N(CH3)-0-5*), amide-3 (3*-CH2-C(=0)-N(H)- 5*), amide-4 (3*-CH2-N(H)-C(=0)-5*), formacetal (3*-0-CH2-0-5*), and thioformacetal (3*-S-CH2-0- 5'). Further neutral internucleoside linkages include nonionic linkages comprising siloxane (dialkylsiloxane), carboxylate ester, carboxamide, sulfide, sulfonate ester and amides (See for example: Carbohydrate Modifications in Antisense Research; Y.S. Sanghvi and P.D. Cook, Eds., ACS Symposium Series 580; Chapters 3 and 4, 40-65). Further neutral internucleoside linkages include nonionic linkages comprising mixed N, O, S and CH2 component parts. In certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds as provided herein can be prepared having one or more optionally protected phosphorus containing internucleoside linkages. Representative protecting groups for phosphorus containing internucleoside linkages such as phosphodiester and phosphorothioate linkages include β-cyanoethyl, diphenylsilylethyl, δ-cyanobutenyl, cyano p-xylyl (CPX), N-methyl-N-trifluoroacetyl ethyl (MET A), acetoxy phenoxy ethyl (APE) and butene-4-yl groups. See for example U.S. Patents Nos. 4,725,677 and Re. 34,069 (β-cyanoethyl); Beaucage et al, Tetrahedron, 1993, 49(10), 1925-1963; Beaucage et al, Tetrahedron, 1993, 49(46), 10441- 10488; Beaucage et al, Tetrahedron, 1992, 48(12), 2223-2311. As used herein, "complementarity" in reference to nucleobases refers to a nucleobase that is capable of base pairing with another nucleobase. For example, in DNA, adenine (A) is complementary to thymine (T). For example, in RNA, adenine (A) is complementary to uracil (U). In certain embodiments, complementary nucleobase refers to a nucleobase of an antisense compound that is capable of base pairing with a nucleobase of its target nucleic acid. For example, if a nucleobase at a certain position of an antisense compound is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleobase at a certain position of a target nucleic acid, then the position of hydrogen bonding between the oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid is considered to be complementary at that nucleobase pair. Nucleobases or more broadly, heterocyclic base moieties, comprising certain modifications may maintain the ability to pair with a counterpart nucleobase and thus, are still capable of complementarity. As used herein, "non-complementary" " in reference to nucleobases refers to a pair of nucleobases that do not form hydrogen bonds with one another or otherwise support hybridization. As used herein, "hybridization" refers to the pairing of complementary oligomeric compounds (e.g., an antisense compound and its target nucleic acid). While not wanting to be limited to a particular mechanism, the most common mechanism of pairing involves hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoogsteen or reversed Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleoside or nucleotide bases (nucleobases). For example, the natural base adenine is nucleobase complementary to the natural nucleobases thymidine and uracil which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. The natural base guanine is nucleobase complementary to the natural bases cytosine and 5 -methyl cytosine. Hybridization can occur under varying circumstances. As used herein, "target nucleic acid" refers to any nucleic acid molecule the expression, amount, or activity of which is capable of being modulated by an antisense compound. In certain embodiments, the target nucleic acid is DNA or RNA. In certain embodiments, the target RNA is mRNA, pre-mRNA, non-coding RNA, pri-microRNA, pre-microRNA, mature microRNA, promoter-directed RNA, or natural antisense transcripts. For example, the target nucleic acid can be a cellular gene (or mRNA transcribed from the gene) whose expression is associated with a particular disorder or disease state, or a nucleic acid molecule from an infectious agent. In certain embodiments, target nucleic acid is a viral or bacterial nucleic acid. In certain embodiments, the preparation of oligomeric compounds as disclosed herein is performed according to literature procedures for DNA: Protocols for Oligonucleotides and Analogs, Agrawal, Ed., Humana Press, 1993, and/or RNA: Scaringe, Methods, 2001, 23, 206-217; Gait et al., Applications of Chemically synthesized RNA in RNA:Protein Interactions, Smith, Ed., 1998, 1-36; Gallo et al, Tetrahedron , 2001, 57, 5707-5713. Additional methods for solid-phase synthesis may be found in Caruthers U.S. Patents Nos. 4,415,732; 4,458,066; 4,500,707; 4,668,777; 4,973,679; and 5,132,418; and Koster U.S. Patents Nos. 4,725,677 and Re. 34,069. Oligomeric compounds are routinely prepared using solid support methods as opposed to solution phase methods. Commercially available equipment commonly used for the preparation of oligomeric compounds that utilize the solid support method is sold by several vendors including, for example, Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Any other means for such synthesis known in the art may additionally or alternatively be employed. Suitable solid phase techniques, including automated synthesis techniques, are described in Oligonucleotides and Analogues, a Practical Approach, F. Eckstein, Ed., Oxford University Press, New York, 1991. The synthesis of RNA and related analogs relative to the synthesis of DNA and related analogs has been increasing as efforts in RNA interference and micro RNA increase. The primary RNA synthesis strategies that are presently being used commercially include 5'-0-DMT-2'-0-t- butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), 5'-0-DMT-2*-0-[ 1 (2-fluorophenyl)-4-methoxypiperidin-4-yl] (FPMP), 2*-0-[(triisopropylsilyl)oxy]methyl (2*-0-CH2-0-Si(iPr)3 (TOM) and the 5 -O-silyl ether- 2'- ACE (5'-0-bis(trimethylsiloxy)cyclododecyloxysilyl ether (DOD)-2'-0-bis(2- acetoxyethoxy)methyl (ACE). A current list of some of the major companies currently offering R A products include Pierce Nucleic Acid Technologies, Dharmacon Research Inc., Ameri Biotechnologies Inc., and Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. One company, Princeton Separations, is marketing an RNA synthesis activator advertised to reduce coupling times especially with TOM and TBDMS chemistries. The primary groups being used for commercial RNA synthesis are: TBDMS: 5'-0-DMT-2*-0-t-butyldimethylsilyl; TOM: 2*-0-[(triisopropylsilyl)oxy]methyl; DOD/ACE: (5'-0-bis(trimethylsiloxy)cyclododecyloxysilyl ether-2'-0-bis(2-acetoxyethoxy)methyl; and FPMP: 5'-0-DMT-2'-0-[l(2-fluorophenyl)-4-ethoxypiperidin-4-yl]. In certain embodiments, each of the aforementioned RNA synthesis strategies can be used herein. In certain embodiments, the aforementioned RNA synthesis strategies can be performed together in a hybrid fashion e.g. using a 5 '-protecting group from one strategy with a 2'-0-protecting from another strategy. In certain embodiments, methods of synthesizing of oligomeric compounds are provided that utilize support medium. In certain embodiments, reactive groups on the support medium are first functionalized with Unylinker™ linking groups prior to addition of the first monomer subunit. A first monomer subunit is attached to a support medium with subsequent monomer subunits iteratively coupled to provide a desired oligomeric compound. The industry standard for large scale oligomeric compound synthesis uses solid support media in a reaction vessel. The growing oligomeric compound is reacted and washed with various reagents and solvents while attached to the solid support. In certain embodiments, support media can be selected having variable solubility in different solvents to allow the growing support bound oligomeric compound to be either in or out of solution at various points in the synthesis process as desired. In certain embodiments, soluble supports include soluble polymer supports that allow precipitating and dissolving the iteratively synthesized product at desired points in the synthesis (Gravert et al, Chem. Rev., 1997, 97, 489- 510). All documents, or portions of documents, cited in this application, including, but not limited to, patents, patent applications, articles, books, and treatises, are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety for any purpose. Those skilled in the art, having possession of the present disclosure will be able to prepare oligomeric compounds, comprising a contiguous sequence of linked monomer subunits, of essentially any viable length. While in certain embodiments, oligomeric compounds provided herein can be prepared as described, the following examples serve only to illustrate and are not intended to be limiting. Example 1 Pre aration of Compound 2 1 2 Compound 1 (2-acetamido-l,3,4,6-tetra-0-acetyl-2-deoxy-P-D-galactopyranose or galactosamine pentaacetate) is commercially available. Following a published procedure, Compound 2 was obtained in a 93% yield (Rensen et al, J. Med. Chem., 2004, 47, 5798-5808; Nakabayashi et al., Carbohyrate Res., 1986, 150, C7). Example 2 Preparation of Compound 5 5 (TFA salt) Delta- valerolactone (46.3 mL, 499.4 mmol, commercially available) was added to 1,3- diaminopropane (148 mL, 1773 mmol, commercially available) in a round bottom flask. The reaction was vigorously stirred. The clear solution obtained was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours and monitored by LCMS. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to provide the crude intermediate Compound 3 a (94 g) which was used for the next step without purification. The structure of the crude amide intermediate compound (Compound 3 a) was confirmed by LCMS and 1H NMR. The crude amide intermediate compound (Compound 3a) from above (94 g, 499.42 mmol) and sodium carbonate (80 g, 749.1 mmol) were suspended in a mixture of 1 ,4-dioxane (900 mL) and water (180 mL) and benzyl chloroformate (106 mL, 749.1 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours and then analyzed by LCMS. The reaction was partitioned with ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate twice. The ethyl acetate layers were combined and concentrated. The residue was suspended in water (900 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane/5% MeOH (450 mL three times). The dichloromethane layers were combined, dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to thick white slurry. The crude material was crystallized with acetone/hexanes to provide Compound 3 as white solid (119.64 g, 78% in these two steps). The structure of Compound 3 was confirmed by LCMS and 1H NMR. Compound 2 (17.2 g, 52.2 mmol), Compound 3 (16.11 g, 52.2 mmol) and pre-dried molecular sieves (20 g) were suspended in dry dichloromethane (120 mL). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes and TMSOTf (4.7 mL) was added. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 12 hours and then analyzed by LCMS. The reaction mixture was poured into icy NaHC03 and extracted with dichloromethane. The dichloromethane extract was washed with brine and concentrated to dryness. The crude product was purified via Biotage silica gel column that was eluted with 2%, (5 column volumes "CV"), 3% (3 CV), 5% (4 CV) and 8% (3 CV) MeOH in dichloromethane to provide Compound 4 as a white foam (22.8 g, 68%). The structure of Compound 4 was confirmed by LCMS and 1H NMR. Compound 4 (5.6 g) was dissolved in ethyl acetate (40 mL) and methanol (40 mL) and palladium on carbon (0.93 g, wet) was added. The reaction was stirred under hydrogen at room temperature for 12 hours and then analyzed by LCMS. The reaction was filtered through a celite pad. The celite pad was thoroughly washed with a mixture of ethyl acetate and methanol (50 mL each). The wash filtrate and filtered residue were combined, TFA (0.67 mL) was added, then the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was co-evaporated with toluene (2 x 30 mL) to dryness to provide Compound 5 (TFA salt) as a yellow foam (5.42 g, quantitative). The structure of Compound 5 was confirmed by LCMS. Example 3 Pre aration of Compound 7 Compound 6 (20 g, commercially available) was dissolved in DMF (150 mL) and DIEA (51 mL) was added. To this mixture, pentafluorophenyl trifluoroacetate (25.4 mL, PFP-TFA) was slowly introduced. The color of the reaction went from colorless to burgundy. The reaction was stirred at RT overnight and monitored by LCMS. The reaction was treated with 1 N NaHS04 (500 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (600 mL). The ethyl acetate extract was washed with brine (150 mL x 2), sat. NaHC03 (200 mL x 2), brine (150 mL x 2) and dried over Na2S04. The ethyl acetate was concentrated to dryness and purified via Biotage (340 g) silica gel column eluted with 10% (3 CV), 20% (3 CV), 30% (6 CV) ethyl acetate in Hexanes to provide Compound 7 as an orange oil (31.87 g, 83%). The structure of Compound 7 was confirmed by LCMS and 1H NMR. Alternate method for the reparation of Compound 7 Compound 6 (commercially available from TCI Scientific, Edmonton, AB, Canada, product # TCS083008) was initially recrystallized as the purity was assayed to be only at about 70%. Purification of Compound 6 provided much purer Compound 7. Note: recrystallization is not required for lots already at about 95% purity. Compound 6 (148.56 grams) was suspended in dry ACN (625 mL) with stirring and heating to 40 °C until all solids dissolved. The reaction was allowed to cool to room temp slowly and then cooled in a refrigerator at 4 °C for one hour. Over the next 30 minutes, a white solid precipitated. The resulting slurry was diluted with cold ACN (250 mL), and was chilled in a salted ice bath (- 2 °C) for 1 hour.
