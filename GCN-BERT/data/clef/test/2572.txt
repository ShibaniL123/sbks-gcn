MODULATION OF MACROPHAGE ACTIVATION SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is generally directed to promoting Ml-type (macrophage Ml polarization) immune response by administering a compound that modulates macrophage activation, also called macrophage polarization. The invention is directed to the use of an antibody able to bind to CSF-1R for modulating macrophage activation/ polarization. The invention is also directed to methods for evaluating the dose efficacy of an antibody able to bind to CSF-1R in a patient by assessing the in vivo or in vitro polarization of macrophages. The invention is further directed to post-treatment companion test and assays to assess the effect of an antibody able to bind to CSF-1R on a subject being treated. During inflammation, circulating monocytes are recruited to the site of inflammation where they adopt a macrophage phenotype dictated by the presence of specific cytokines and growth factors. Mature macrophages are divided into two populations, Ml-polarized or "classically activated" and M2-polarized or "alternatively activated." Macrophages are important tumor-infiltrating cells and play pivotal roles in tumor growth and metastasis. In most solid tumors, the existence of macrophages is advantageous for tumor growth and metastasis. Recent studies indicate that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) show a M2 phenotype. These tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) produce interleukin IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF) β to suppress general antitumor immune responses. Meanwhile, TAMs promote tumor neo-angiogenesis by the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors and define the invasive microenvironment to facilitate tumor metastasis and dissemination. For these reasons, selective depletion of M2 TAMs has been considered as a novel approach to anti-cancer therapy (Sica et al., 2006, European Journal of Cancer, 42,717-727). Macrophages participate in immune responses to tumors in a polarized manner. The Ml differentiation is triggered by GM-CSF and further stimulated by with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) , bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and is mediated by several signal transduction pathways involving signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), nuclear factor kappa-light-chainenhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) , and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). These events enhance the production of agents such as the reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide (NO) and promote the subsequent inflammatory immune responses by increasing antigen presentation capacity and inducing the Thl immunity through the production of cytokines such as IL12. In contrast, M2 macrophage activation is used to describe macrophages activated in ways other than the Ml activation including IL4/IL13-stimulated macrophages, ILlO-induced macrophages and immune complex-triggered macrophages. Among many molecular differences between Ml versus M2 activation, the ratio of IL12 and IL10 production is critical to distinguish Ml and M2 macrophages. Noticeably, TAMs share many properties of M2 macrophages. TAMs exhibit a M2 profile characterized not only by a IL-12lowIL-10hlsh phenotype but also high FcR-mediated phagocytic capacity associated with regulatory functions (Schmieder et al. 2012, Semin Cancer Biol., 22, 289-297). The haemoglobin scavenger receptor (CD163) has been identified as a marker of M2-polarized macrophages which is expressed by TAMs (Ambarus et al. 2012, 375,196-206). TAMs can represent the most abundant immunosuppressive cell population in the tumor microenvironment, recruited by CSF-1 and CCL-2 (MCP-1) (Sica et al. 2006, Eur J Cancer., 42, 717-727). Similarly, the alternatively activated M2 macrophages have been implicated in several pathologies, the most prominent of which are allergy and asthma (Duffield, 2003, Clin. Sci. 104, 27; Gordon, 2003, Nat. Rev. Immunol., 3, 23; Dagupta and Keegan, J. Innate Immun., 2012, 4, 478). The Inventors have now shown that certain monoclonal antibodies are able to switch M2 macrophages towards Ml macrophages (i.e. to induce the differentiation of Ml rather than M2 macrophages). They have shown that the said monoclonal antibodies are able to down regulate surface FcγRI (CD64) and FcγRIII (CD16) to down regulate MCP-1 (Macrophage Chemotactic Protein 1, also called CCL-2), IL-6, MMP9 and/or IL-10 production, and to promote IL-12, IL-10, TNF-α production. They have further shown that the said monoclonal antibodies inhibit the differentiation of CD163+ M2-type macrophages from human monocytes and increases M1/M2 macrophage ratios.

As used herein, the term "CSF-1R" refers to the human CSFl receptor. As used herein, "antibody" or "Ab" is used in the broadest sense. Therefore, an "antibody” or "Ab" can be naturally occurring or man-made such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) produced by conventional hybridoma technology, recombinant technology and/or a functional fragment thereof. Antibodies of the present invention are preferably monoclonal antibodies (mAh). As used herein, the term "variable region" refers to the variable region, or domain, of the light chain (VL) or heavy chain (VH) which contains the determinants for binding recognition specificity. The variable domains are involved in antigen recognition and form the antigen binding site. The variable region of both the heavy and light chain is divided into segments comprising four framework sub-regions (FRI, FR2, FR3, and FR4), interrupted by three stretches of hypervariable sequences, or the complementary determining regions (CDR's), as defined in Rabat's database, with the CDR1 positioned between FR1 and FR2, CDR2 between FR2 and FR3, and CDR3 between FR3 and FR4. Without specifying the particular sub-regions as FRI, FR2, FR3 or FR4, a framework region as referred by others, represents the combined FR's within the variable region of a single, naturally occurring immunoglobulin chain. As used herein, a FR represents one of the four sub-regions, and FR's represents two or more of the four sub-regions constituting a framework region. The framework region of an antibody is the combined framework regions of the constituent light and heavy chains and serves to position and align the CDR's. The CDR's are primarily responsible for forming the binding site of an antibody conferring binding specificity and affinity to an epitope of an antigen. Within the variable regions of the H or L chains that provide for the antigen binding regions are smaller sequences dubbed "hypervariable" because of their extreme variability between antibodies of differing specificity. Such hypervariable regions are also referred to as "complementarity determining regions" or "CDR" regions. These CDR regions account for the basic specificity of the antibody for a particular antigenic determinant structure. The variable heavy and light chains of all antibodies each have 3 CDR regions, each non-contiguous with the others (termed LI, L2, L3, Hi, H2, H3) for the respective light (L) and heavy (H) chains. "Co~administer" means to administer in conjunction with one another, together, coordinately, including simultaneous or sequential administration of two or more agents. "Effective amount" generally means an amount which provides the desired local or systemic effect, e.g., effective to ameliorate undesirable effects of inflammation, including modulation of activation of macrophages, etc. For example, an effective amount is an amount sufficient to effectuate a beneficial or desired clinical result. The effective amounts can be provided all at once in a single administration or in fractional amounts that provide the effective amount in several administrations. The precise determination of what would be considered an effective amount may be based on factors individual to each subject, including their size, age, injury, and/or disease or injury being treated, and amount of time since the injury occurred or the disease began. One skilled in the art will be able to determine the effective amount for a given subject based on these considerations which are routine in the art. As used herein, "effective dose" means the same as "effective amount".

Results Anti-CD115 mAb H27K15 is not cytotoxic to macrophages but polarizes their differentiation towards the Ml type To study whether mAb H27K15 could affect macrophage differentiation, purified CD14+ monocytes were cultured for 7 days in the presence of GM-CSF and CSF-1, known to induce respectively Ml- and M2-type macrophages (Akagawa K.S., 2002; Verreck F.A. et al., 2004) . Three different doses of mab H27K15 or isotype control rituximab (0.1 ; 1 or 10 μg/itil) were added to the culture medium at the beginning of the culture and again 3 days later. F(ab')2 generated from H27K15 or from rituximab were tested in parallel at equivalent molar concentrations, F(ab')2 generated from mAb 1.2 SM (WO 2009/026303) was tested for comparison with the F(ah') 2 derived from H27K15 or rituximab. The known blocking mAb to human CD115, 2-4A5, or the non-blocking mAb 9-4D2 (Sherr C.J. et al., 1989) were assayed and compared with isotype control rat IgGl. As another control, the small molecule CD115 tyrosine kinase inhibitor GW2580 was added to some of the cultures at 1 μM, a concentration previously shown to inhibit the CSF-l-dependent proliferation of human monocytes and the differentiation of murine macrophages in vitro (Conway J.G. et al., 2005; Paniagua R.T. et al., 2010). Microscopical observation of day-6 cultures showed no obvious differences between wells treated with H27K15, Rituximab, mAb 9-4D2, IgGl, H27K15 F(ab')2 or Rituximab F(ab')2, compared with untreated cells, independently of the blood donor. For the wells treated with mAb SMI.2 F(ab')2, full cytotoxicity was observed for all donors for the 3 doses evaluated (0.066, 0.66 and 6.6 μg/ml) . For the wells treated with mAb 2-4A5, full cytotoxicity was observed for all donors at the 2 highest doses tested (1 and 10 μg/rnl) . For the lowest dose (0.1 μg/ml), cytotoxicity was only partial. Altogether, those results did not reveal any toxicity of any antibody except for mAb SMI. 2 F(ab')2 and mAb 2-4A5. For the cells with the control GW2580 at 1 μM, depending on the microscope field, a relative cytotoxicity was visualized as debris and less density of cells was observed in all blood donors. Cell viability was analyzed at day 6 by counting 5 microscope fields in each well of the plate (one in the center of the well and four fields at mid-distance between the center and the side of the well) . Based on the above observations, numeration was done also for wells treated with compounds exhibiting partial or full cytotoxicity (mAb SMI.2 F(ab')2, mAb 2-4A5 and GW2580) . Figure 1 shows the means of 5 fields counted by individual well ± standard deviation. Some antibodies exhibited partial or full cytotoxicity. Thus, the F(ab'}2 derived from mAb SMI.2 had induced massive cell death at all concentrations and mAb 2-4A5 also dramatically reduced macrophage numbers, in comparison with their respective controls. In the presence of GW2580, approximately 70% of the macrophage number remained at day 6 compared with untreated cultures. Day 6 cultures were analyzed by IC/FC for surface expression of the activating FcyR CD64 (FcyRI) and of the activation marker CD86. As shown on Figure 2, surface expression of CD64 was drastically reduced upon treatment with H27K15 or with GW2580. H27K15 almost totally inhibited CD64 expression at all doses tested. Rat anti-human CD115 mAb 2-4A5 also decreased surface CD64 expression, but in a dose-dependent fashion. The non-CD115 blocking mAb 9-4D2 did not modify CD64 expression level. Interestingly, F(ab')2 derived from H27K15 also downregulated CD64 expression, but less potently than the full mAb and only when tested at 1 or 10 μg/ml, suggesting that the effect of H27K15 was partially Fc-dependent. When the expression of the activation marker / co-stimulatory molecule CD86 was analyzed in day-6 macrophages, we found that a sub-population of cells characterized by the CD8 6bright SSClθH phenotype had appeared in the cultures treated with either mAb H27K15 or with GW2580 (Figure 3}. Induction of this population of round-shaped cells expressing high levels of CD86 was not observed with H27K15-derived F(ab,)2, suggesting a role for H27K15 Fc region in this phenomenon. Gating on this population showed that CD8 6bright SSClow cells were mainly CD64 low to CD64-negative (data not shown). IL-12p70 and IL-10 were titrated in day-6 culture supernatants. Macrophages from the 3 donors tested did not produce any detectable IL-12p70 following culture with human IgGi rituximab or no reagent. Culture in the presence of mAb H27K15 induced IL-12p70 secretion by macrophages from 2 of the 3 blood donors. In contrast, IL-12p70 was not detectable after treatment with GW2580 (Figure 4). IL-10, which was produced by resting macrophages from all donors, was up-regulated by H27K15 in macrophages from donor 1 but not in donor 2 and was only weakly increased in donor 3. As a result, IL-12p70 / IL-10 ratios were up-regulated in the 3 blood donors tested (Figure 4, right panel). Small molecule GW258Q also increased IL-12p70 / IL-10 ratios, but rather due to the inhibition of IL-10 production. These results show that targeting CD115 with mAb H27K15 on differentiating macrophages not only dramatically downregulates the expression of CD64 / FcγRI, but also induces a population of SSClow cells expressing high levels of the CD86 activation marker. In addition, H27K15 can induce IL-12p70 production and upregulates IL-12p70 / IL-10 ratios in all donors, indicative of macrophage polarization towards Ml-type. Strikingly, production of the chemokine MCP-1 / CCL2 was found to be almost totally suppressed when macrophages were differentiated in the presence of mAb H27K15 or GW2580 (Figure 5, upper panel)« Inhibition of MCP-1 secretion by H27K15 was effective in the 3 donors tested and ranged from 74 % to 99 %. Small molecule GW2580 was as efficacious as H27K15 . in suppressing MCP-1 production. Levels of IL-6 in day-6 macrophage culture supernatants were also reduced by either H27K15 or GW2580 in all donors (Figure 5, lower panel) . Inhibition of IL-6 production was less drastic with H27K15 (from 27 % to 70 %) than with GW2580 (from 75 to 96%). H27K15-mediated inhibition of macrophage MCP-1 and IL-6 production (Roca H. et al., 2009), two soluble factors implicated in M2 macrophage polarization, is another piece of evidence indicating that the anti-CD115 mAb repolarizes macrophages towards Ml. Anti-CD115 mAb H27K15 inhibits MMP-9 production by monocytes cultured with GM-CSF and CSF-1 Tumor-associated macrophages are known to produce MMP-9 (matrix-metalloprotease 9) , which promotes both tumor cell metastasis by degrading the extracellular matrix and neoangiogenesis by inducing VEGF release in the tumor microenvironment. MMP-9 produced by macrophages is a major regulator of the angiogenic switch in tumors. CD14+ monocytes from 3 different donors were allowed to differentiate in the presence of both GM-CSF and CSF-1, known to induce macrophage differentiation towards respectively the Ml- and M2-types. MAb H27K15 or Rituximab (used as a negative control) were added to the cultures at 0.1, 1 or 10 μg/ml. Equimolar concentrations of F(ab)'2 derived from both mAbs were assayed in parallel. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor GW2580, previously shown to inhibit the CSF-l-dependent proliferation of human monocytes and the differentiation of murine macrophages in vitro was tested in the same assay. After 6 days of culture, MMP-9 concentrations were measured in the supernatants by ELISA (Figure 6) . In 2 out of 3 donors tested, there was a dose-dependent decrease in MMP-9 production when cultures were treated with mAb H27K15 or with GW258Q. With F(ab)'2 derived from H27K15, there was an inhibitory effect in the same 2 donors. Thus, mAb H27K15 is capable of decreasing MMP-9 secretion by differentiating M2 macrophages. These observations in macrophage cultures suggest that H27K15 administered to cancer patients may down-regulate MMP-9 concentration in the tumor microenvironment. MAb H27K15 inhibits the differentiation of CDl63-positive M2-type macrophages The hemoglobin scavenger receptor (CD163) has been identified as a marker of M2-polarized macrophages which is expressed by TAMs, notably in breast cancer. The surface expression of CD163 was analyzed by flow cytometry in day-6 macrophages derived from human monocytes cultured with GM-CSF and CSF-1. Figure 7 shows the percentages of CDl63-positive cells in differentiated cultures. Culture with mAb H27K15 inhibited the differentiation of the CD163+ macrophage population in all 3 donors tested. In the presence of 1 μg/ml H27K15, percentages of CDl63-positive cells decreased from 2.5 to 4 folds compared with control cultures treated with rituximab. GW2580 had the same effect in only 2/3 donors. F(ab}72 derived from H27K15 had weak or no effect on CD163 expression, indicating that the Fc region of the anti-CDH5 mAb was involved in its mode of action. As evidenced by these changes in surface CD163 expression and in agreement with the previous results, targeting CD115 with mAb H27K15 inhibits the differentiation of M2-type macrophages. MAb H27K15 skews monocyte differentiation from M2 to Ml macrophages The ratios between Ml and M2 macrophages were analyzed in cells derived from monocytes cultured with GM-CSF and CSF-1, in the presence or absence of mAb H27K15 or rituximab. After a 6-days culture of cells from 2 different blood donors, Ml (CD14+CD163~) versus M2 (CD14+CD163+) macrophages were quantified by flow cytometry. Figure 8 shows the M1/M2 macrophage ratios calculated among the CD14+ macrophage population for each culture condition. MAb H27K15 at 1 μg/ml increased M1/M2 ratios in macrophages from the 2 donors tested, compared to control IgGi rituximab at the same concentration or to untreated cultures. Akagawa K.S.
