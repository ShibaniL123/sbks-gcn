Step 1. 3-Bromo-N-(trans-4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide
To a mixture of trans-4-aminocyclohexanol (0.47 g, 4.1 mmol), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (9 mg, 0.07 mmol), and triethylamine (1.0 mL, 7.4 mmol) in DCM (20 mL) at 0° C. was added 3-bromo-4-methylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (1.0 g, 3.7 mmol) (Combi-Blocks, WZ-9240) in a single portion. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight while coming to room temperature. The reaction was then quenched with sat. NaHCO3. The organic layer was removed, and the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (2×). The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography (20-75% EtOAc in DCM (1% MeOH)) afforded the title compound as a white solid (0.94 g, 73%). LCMS for C13H18BrNO3SNa (M+Na)+: calculated m/z=370.0, 372.0; found 370.0, 372.0.
