2.2: 1-benzhydryl-5-bromo-3-methyl-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione
290 mg (2.1 mmol) of potassium carbonate and 0.1 ml (2.1 mmol) of methyl iodide are added to a solution of 500 mg (1.4 mmol) of 1-benzhydryl-5-bromo-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione in 10 ml of dimethylformamide. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hours, then hydrolysed and diluted with ethyl acetate. The product is extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic phase is washed once with water, once with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, and then dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. 490 mg (94%) of 1-benzhydryl-5-bromo-3-methyl-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a yellow solid.
